Abstract: Background
Müller cell gliosis not only plays an important physiological role by maintaining retinal neuronal homeostasis but is also associated with multiple pathological events in the retina, including optic nerve crush (ONC) injury. Modulating Müller cell gliosis contributes to the creation of a permissive environment for neuronal survival. However, the underlying mechanism of Müller cell gliosis has remained elusive.
Objective
To investigate the underlying mechanism of Müller cell gliosis after ONC.
Methods
Rats with ONC injury were transfected with miRNA-21 (miR-21) agomir (overexpressing miR-21) or antagomir (inhibiting miR-21) via intravitreous injection. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were performed to confirm the effects of miR-21 on Müller cell gliosis. The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was measured using optical coherence tomography and the positive scotopic threshold response (pSTR) was recorded using electroretinogram.
Results
In the acute phase (14 days) after ONC, compared with the crushed group, inhibiting miR-21 promoted Müller cell gliosis, exhibiting thicker processes and increased GFAP expression. In the chronic phase (35 days), inhibiting miR-21 ameliorated Müller cell gliosis, which exhibited thicker and denser processes and increased GFAP expression. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) counts in retinas showed that the number of surviving RGCs increased significantly in the antagomir group. The thickness of the RNFL increased significantly, and pSTR showed significant preservation of the amplitudes in the antagomir group.
Conclusions
Inhibition of miR-21 promotes RGC survival, RNFL thickness and the recovery of RGC function by modulating Müller cell gliosis after ONC.

Abstract: Summary
In adult stem cell populations, recruitment into division is parsimonious and most cells maintain a quiescent state. How individual cells decide to enter the cell cycle and how they coordinate their activity remains an essential problem to be resolved. It is thus important to develop methods to elucidate the mechanisms of cell communication and recruitment into the cell cycle. We made use of the advantageous architecture of the adult zebrafish telencephalon to isolate the surface proteins of an intact neural stem cell (NSC) population. We identified the proteome of NSCs in young and old brains. The data revealed a group of proteins involved in filopodia, which we validated by a morphological analysis of single cells, showing apically located cellular extensions. We further identified an age-related decrease in insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors. Expressing IGF2b induced divisions in young brains but resulted in incomplete divisions in old brains, stressing the role of cell-intrinsic processes in stem cell behavior.

Abstract: Irisin plays a protective effect in acute and chronic myocardial damage, but its role in septic cardiomyopathy is unclear. The aim of our study was to explore the in vivo and in vitro effects of irisin using an LPS-induced septic cardiomyopathy model. Our results demonstrated that irisin treatment attenuated LPS-mediated cardiomyocyte death and myocardial dysfunction. At the molecular level, LPS application was associated with mitochondrial oxidative injury, cardiomyocyte ATP depletion and caspase-related apoptosis activation. In contrast, the irisin treatment sustained mitochondrial function by inhibiting DRP1-related mitochondrial fission and the reactivation of mitochondrial fission impaired the protective action of irisin on inflammation-attacked mitochondria and cardiomyocytes. Additionally, we found that irisin modulated DRP1-related mitochondrial fission through the JNK-LATS2 signaling pathway. JNK activation and/or LATS2 overexpression abolished the beneficial effects of irisin on LPS-mediated mitochondrial stress and cardiomyocyte death. Altogether, our results illustrate that LPS-mediated activation of DRP1-related mitochondrial fission through the JNK-LATS2 pathway participates in the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy. Irisin could be used in the future as an effective therapy for sepsis-induced myocardial depression because it corrects DRP1-related mitochondrial fission and normalizes the JNK-LATS2 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Regulation of vascular permeability plays a major role in the pathophysiology of visually threatening conditions such as retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy. Principally, several factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are up-regulated or induced in response to hypoxia thus adversely affecting the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), resulting in retinal edema and neovascularisation. Furthermore, current evidence supports a dysregulation of the inner retinal neural-vascular integrity as a critical factor driving retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and visual loss. The principal objective of this study was to interrogate whether Substance P (SP), a constitutive neurotransmitter of amacrine and ganglion cells, may protect against N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic apoptosis of ganglion cells and VEGF-induced vessel leakage in the retina. Tight junctional protein expression and a Vascular Permeability Image Assay were used to determine vascular integrity in vitro. The protective effect of SP on RGC was established in ex vivo retinal explants and in vivo murine models. After NMDA administration, a reduction in TUNEL+ cells and a maintained number of Brn-3a+ cells were found, indicating an inhibition of RGC apoptosis mediated by SP. Additionally, SP maintained endothelial tight junctions and decreased VEGF-induced vascular permeability. In conclusion, administration of SP protects against NMDA apoptosis of RGC and VEGF-induced endothelial barrier breakdown.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming female mouse somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) leads to X-chromosome reactivation. The extent to which increased X-chromosome dosage (X-dosage) in female iPSCs compared with male iPSCs leads to differences in the properties of iPSCs is still unclear. We show that chromatin accessibility in mouse iPSCs is modulated by X-dosage. Specific sets of transcriptional regulator motifs are enriched in chromatin with increased accessibility in XX or XY iPSCs. The transcriptome, growth and pluripotency exit are also modulated by X-dosage in iPSCs. To understand how increased X-dosage modulates the properties of mouse pluripotent stem cells, we used heterozygous deletions of the X-linked gene Dusp9. We show that X-dosage regulates the transcriptome, open chromatin landscape, growth, and pluripotency exit largely independently of global DNA methylation. Our results provide insights into how gene dosage modulates the epigenetic and genetic mechanisms that regulate cell identity.

Abstract: Heat shock protein Hsp70 (Hsp70) is found on the cell surface of a large variety of human and mouse tumor cell types including U87, GL261 glioblastoma, and 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells. We studied the role of membrane-bound Hsp70 (mHsp70) in the formation of cell-to-cell connections via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) using live-cell STED nanoscopy. This technique allows the visualization of microstructures in the 100-nm range in the living cells. We could show that the presence of tumor-derived mHsp70 in TNTs with a diameter ranging from 120 to 140nm predominantly originates from cholesterol-rich-microdomains containing the lipid compound globoyltriaosylceramide (Gb3). Under non-stress conditions, Hsp70 and Gb3 are structurally clustered in the membrane of TNTs of tumor cells that showed tumor type specific variations in the amount of cell-to-cell connection networks. Furthermore depletion of cholesterol and ionizing radiation as a stress factor results in a complete loss of Hsp70-containing TNTs.

Abstract: E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are key enzymes in the ubiquitin proteasome system, catalyze the ubiquitination of proteins to target them for proteasomal degradation. Emerging evidence suggests that E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in the development and progression of lung cancer. In our study, we characterized the gene expression landscape of lung cancer using data obtained from TCGA to explore the changes in E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the regulators of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Overall, most gene expression changes occurred in NSCLC tissues compared with adjacent normal ones. In total, 48 E3 ubiquitin ligases containing the regulators were up-regulated in NSCLC tissues compared with their levels in normal tissues. We analyzed the expression of up-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligases containing the regulators in two publicly available transcriptome data sets (GSE13213 and GSE30219). We found that four E3 ubiquitin ligases (UHRF1, BRCA1, TRAIP and HLTF) and one regulator of ubiquitin E3 activity DCUN1D1 that were dramatically up-regulated in cancer were significantly associated with tumor metastasis and patient's poor prognosis both in two transcriptome data sets. Next, clinical analysis indicated that the expression levels of DCUN1D1 correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis in NSCLC patients as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Furthermore, functional assays showed that DCUN1D1 promoted NSCLC cell invasion and migration as determined by transwell assay in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that the C-terminal Cullin binding domain leads to oncogenic activity and the UBA domain acts as a negative regulator of DCUN1D1 function in NSCLC. Moreover, DCUN1D1 activated the FAK oncogenic signaling pathway and up-regulated PD-L1. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DCUN1D1 is a metastasis regulator and suggest a new therapeutic option for NSCLC metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Eicosanoids and related oxylipins are critical, small bioactive mediators of human physiology and inflammation. While ∼1,100 distinct species have been predicted to exist, to date, less than 150 of these molecules have been measured in humans, limiting our understanding of their role in human biology. Using a directed non-targeted mass spectrometry approach in conjunction with chemical networking of spectral fragmentation patterns, we find over 500 discrete chemical signals highly consistent with known and putative eicosanoids and related oxylipins in human plasma including 46 putative molecules not previously described. In plasma samples from 1,500 individuals, we find members of this expanded oxylipin library hold close association with markers of inflammation, as well as clinical characteristics linked with inflammation, including advancing age and obesity. These experimental and computational approaches enable discovery of new chemical entities and will shed important insight into the role of bioactive molecules in human health and disease.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated to play a role in initiating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis. We have investigated the mechanism(s) by which essential redox-active trace metals (RATM) may induce cell proliferation and cell death in rabbit synovial fibroblasts. These fibroblast-like synovial (FLS) cells, which express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), were used as a model system that plays a role in potentially initiating RA through oxidative stress. Potassium peroxychromate (PPC, [Cr5+]), ferrous chloride (FeCl2, [Fe2+]), and cuprous chloride (CuCl, [Cu+]) in the indicated valency states were used as exogenous pro-oxidants that can induce oxidative stress through TLR4 coupled activation that also causes HMGB1 release. We measured the proliferation index (PI) of FLS, and examined the effect of RATM oxidants on apoptosis and autophagy by fluorescence cell-sorting flow cytometry (FC). Cell cycle was analysed by FC and autophagy-related protein expression levels were measured by western blot. Our data showed that as RATM as prooxidants increased intracellular ROS (iROS) that can induce oxidative stress. Whereas iROS increased PI in FLS, these reactive species also protected cells against apoptosis by inducing autophagy. Our results indicate that ROS/TLR4-coupled activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA in FLS by induction of autophagy. The signalling pathway by which inflammation and its tissue destructive sequel may occur in RA underlies the need for developing therapeutic agents that can inhibit release of tissue-damaging high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), cytokines, and possess both trace metal chelating capacity and oxidant scavenging properties in a directed combinatorial therapy for RA.

Abstract: Summary
In the inner ear, endolymph fluid surrounds the organ of Corti, which is important for auditory function; notably, even slight environmental changes mediated by trauma or infection can have significant consequences. However, it is unclear how the immune response is modulated in these tissues. Here, we report the local immune surveillance role of cleaved cochlin LCCL (Limulus factor C, Cochlin, and Lgl1) during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the cochlea. Upon infection, the LCCL domain is cleaved from cochlin and secreted into the perilymph. This cleaved fragment sequesters infiltrating bacteria in the scala tympani and subsequently recruits resident immune cells to eliminate the bacteria. Importantly, hearing loss in a cochlin knockout mouse model is remedied by treatment with a cochlin LCCL peptide. These findings suggest cleaved cochlin LCCL constitutes a critical factor in innate immunity and auditory function and may be a potential therapeutic target to treat chronic otitis media-induced hearing loss.

Abstract: Summary
Anamniotes, rodents, and young humans maintain neural stem cells in the ependymal zone (EZ) around the central canal of the spinal cord, representing a possible endogenous source for repair in mammalian lesions. Cell diversity and genes specific for this region are ill defined. A cellular and molecular resource is provided here for the mouse and human EZ based on RNA profiling, immunostaining, and fluorescent transgenic mice. This uncovered the conserved expression of 1,200 genes including 120 transcription factors. Unexpectedly the EZ maintains an embryonic-like dorsal-ventral pattern of expression of spinal cord developmental transcription factors (ARX, FOXA2, MSX1, and PAX6). In mice, dorsal and ventral EZ cells express Vegfr3 and are derived from the embryonic roof and floor plates. The dorsal EZ expresses a high level of Bmp6 and Gdf10 genes and harbors a subpopulation of radial quiescent cells expressing MSX1 and ID4 transcription factors.

Abstract: Summary
The glycan ligands recognized by Siglecs, influenza viruses, and galectins, as well as many plant lectins, are not well defined. To explore their binding to asparagine (Asn)-linked N-glycans, we synthesized a library of isomeric multiantennary N-glycans that vary in terminal non-reducing sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine residues, as well as core fucose. We identified specific recognition of N-glycans by several plant lectins, human galectins, influenza viruses, and Siglecs, and explored the influence of sialic acid linkages and branching of the N-glycans. These results show the unique recognition of complex-type N-glycans by a wide variety of glycan-binding proteins and their abilities to distinguish isomeric structures, which provides new insights into the biological roles of these proteins and the uses of lectins in biological applications to identify glycans.

Abstract: Many cell death regulators physically or functionally interact with metabolic enzymes. These interactions provide insights into mechanisms of anticancer treatments from the perspective of tumor cell metabolism and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that zinc and p53 not only induce tumor cell apoptosis, but also regulate tumor cell metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism is complex and remains unclear, making further research imperative to provide clues for future cancer treatments. In this study, we found that hexokinase 2 (HK2), which has dual metabolic and apoptotic functions, is downstream of zinc and p53 in both prostate cancer patient tissue and prostate cancer cell lines. Notably, the mitochondrial location of HK2 is crucial for its function. We demonstrate that zinc and p53 disrupt mitochondrial binding of HK2 in prostate cancer cells by phosphorylating VDAC1, which is mediated by protein kinase B (Akt) inhibition and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activation. In addition, we found that zinc combined with p53 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a prostate cancer cell xenograft model. Therefore, interference of the mitochondrial localization of HK2 by zinc and p53 may provide a new treatment approach for cancer.

Abstract: Background
Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) can cause graft loss and reduces long-term graft survival after kidney transplantation. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and/or non-HLA antibodies play a key role in the pathogenesis of AMR by targeting the allograft epithelium via complement activation and complement-independent mechanisms. However, the precise mechanisms of AMR remain unclear and treatment is still limited.
Methods
In this study, we investigated the role of the endothelial-associated transcription factor Sox7 in AMR, using the anti-HLA antibody W6/32, shRNA-mediated Sox7 knockdown, and by manipulating the Notch pathway. We used an in vitro human kidney glomerular endothelial cells (HKGECs) model and an in vivo MHC-mismatched kidney transplantation model.
Results
Sox7 expression was upregulated and the Jagged1-Notch1 pathway was activated in HKGECs after W6/32 activation. W6/32 antibodies increased the expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), and chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL10), and Sox7 knockdown and inhibition of the Notch pathway by DAPT significantly reduced these effects. Jagged1 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effects of Sox7 knockdown. In addition, Sox7 knockdown attenuated acute allograft kidney injury in mice and reduced the expression of adhesion molecules and Jagged1-Notch1 signaling after transplantation.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that Sox7 plays an important role in mediating HLA I antibody-dependent endothelial cell activation and acute kidney allograft rejection via the Jagged1-Notch1 pathway. Manipulating Sox7 in donor organs may represent a useful treatment for AMR in solid organ transplantation.

Abstract: IGFBP-3 has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on cancer progression. The growth of EO771 mammary carcinoma cells as syngeneic tumors in C57BL/6 mice is reduced in Igfbp3-null (BP3KO) mice, suggesting that systemic IGFBP-3 enhances tumor progression. In this study we assessed the growth of EO771 cells expressing human IGFBP-3 in BP3KO mice. Cells expressing hIGFBP-3 showed decreased proliferation in vitro and increased levels of IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) protein but not mRNA, consistent with sequestration of endogenous IGF by IGFBP-3. The growth rate of these cells was restored by exposure to IGF-1 or analogues with reduced affinity for IGFBP-3 (long Arg3-IGF-1) or IGF1R (Leu24-IGF-1). In EO771 cells implanted orthotopically into mice, hIGFBP-3 expression by the cells inhibited tumor establishment in BP3KO but not wild-type mice. For tumors that successfully established, final weight was not affected significantly by hIGFBP-3 expression. However, final tumor weight was inversely related to intratumoral T cell counts, and sera from BP3KO mice with tumors showed low-titer immunoreactivity against IGFBP-3. The contrasting effects on tumor establishment and progression of IGFBP-3 expressed by mammary carcinoma cells, compared to systemic stromal and circulating IGFBP-3, highlights the complexity of growth regulation by IGFBP-3 in mammary tumors.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in equines as an alternative therapy. A comparative study about the phenotype and in vitro performance of different MSCs tissue sources in adult equines was needed. This study might serve to provide the knowledge to select a valuable harvesting source of MSCs. Bone marrow, synovial and adipose (mesenteric, neck and tail fat) tissues were collected from adult equines. Cell surface markers expression (CD11α/CD18, CD45, CD79α, CD90, CD105 and MHC II) and in vitro differentiation assays were made. In vitro cell migration, cell growth and wound healing capacity tests helped to study their behavior and properties. MSCs phenotype was positively confirmed by the cell surfaces markers and a tri-lineage differentiation profile. Bone marrow cells showed the highest migration capacity, while synovial fluid cells displayed the highest cell growth. Bone marrow cells showed a better wound healing when compared with all the different MSCs. We conclude that bone marrow, synovial and adipose tissue derived from adult equines are a good source for cell therapy but they conserve different functional properties: bone marrow showed an interesting migration and wound healing capacity while synovial fluid cells and their highest cell growth suggest that these MSCs would yield higher cell numbers in a shorter time.

Abstract: Autophagy plays an important role in maintaining cell function. Abnormal autophagy leads to cell dysfunction and is associated with many diseases such as tumors, immunodeficiency diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is precisely regulated, and PTEN plays an important role in regulating autophagy. As noncoding small RNAs, miRNAs play an important role in the fine regulation of cellular processes. However, the mechanism of the miRNA regulation of PTEN-related autophagy has not been fully elucidated. In this study, our results showed that miR-4465 significantly inhibited the expression of PTEN, upregulated phosphorylated AKT, and thereby inhibited autophagy by activating mTOR in HEK293, HeLa, and SH-SY5Y cells. Further studies indicated that miR-4465 reduced PTEN mRNA levels through posttranscriptional regulation via directly targeting the 3′-UTR. Our novel findings provide useful hints for the comprehensive elucidation of the molecular mechanism of miRNA-regulated PTEN-related autophagy and may also provide some new insights for the exploration of miRNAs in the treatment of PTEN-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The neurological recovery following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is limited, largely due to a deficiency in neurogenesis. The present study explores the effects of histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonism on TBI and mechanisms related to neurogenesis. H3R antagonism or H3R gene knockout alleviated neurological injury in the late phase of TBI, and also promoted neuroblast differentiation to enhance neurogenesis through activation of the histaminergic system. Histamine H1 receptor, but not H2 receptor, in neural stem cells is shown to be essential for this promotion by using Hrh1fl/fl;NestinCreERT2 and Hrh2fl/fl;NestinCreERT2 mice. Moreover, increase in mature and functional neurons at the penumbra area conferred by H3R antagonism was abrogated in Hrh1fl/fl;NestinCreERT2 mice. Taken together, H3R antagonism provides neuroprotection against TBI in the late phase through the promotion of neurogenesis, and the H1 receptor in neural stem cells is required for this action. H3R may serve as a new target for clinical treatment of TBI.

Abstract: Summary
Malayamycin A is an unusual bicyclic C-nucleoside, with interesting antiviral, antifungal, and anticancer bioactivity. We report here the discovery and characterization of the biosynthetic pathway to malayamycin by using genome mining of near-identical clusters both from the known producer Streptomyces malaysiensis and from Streptomyces chromofuscus. The key precursor 5′-pseudouridine monophosphate (5′-Ψ-MP) is supplied chiefly through the action of MalD, a TruD-like pseudouridine synthase. In vitro assays showed that MalO is an enoylpyruvyltransferase acting almost exclusively on 5′-Ψ-MP rather than 5′-UMP, while in contrast the counterpart enzyme NikO in the nikkomycin pathway readily accepts either substrate. As a result, deletion of malD in S. chromofuscus coupled with introduction of the gene for NikO led to production of non-natural N-malayamycin, as well as malayamycin A. Conversely, cloning malO into the nikkomycin producer Streptomyces tendae in place of nikO diverted biosynthesis toward C-nucleoside formation.

Abstract: Summary
Exogenous cues involved in the regulation of the initial steps of lymphatic endothelial development remain largely unknown. We have used an in vitro model based on the co-culture of vascular precursors derived from mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and OP9 stromal cells to examine the first steps of lymphatic specification and expansion. We found that bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) induced a dose-dependent biphasic effect on ESC-derived vascular precursors. At low concentrations, below 1 ng/mL, BMP9 expands the LYVE-1-positive lymphatic progeny and activates the calcineurin phosphatase/NFATc1 signaling pathway. In contrast, higher BMP9 concentrations preferentially enhance the formation of LYVE-1-negative endothelial cells. This effect results from an OP9 stromal cell-mediated VEGF-A secretion. RNA-silencing experiments indicate specific involvement of ALK1 and ALK2 receptors in these different BMP9 responses. BMP9 at low concentrations may be a useful tool to generate lymphatic endothelial cells from stem cells for cell-replacement strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The epidithiodioxopiperazine gliotoxin is a virulence factor of Aspergillus fumigatus, the most important airborne fungal pathogen of humans. Gliotoxin suppresses innate immunity in invasive aspergillosis, particularly by compromising neutrophils, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Neutrophils are the first responders among innate immune cells recruited to sites of infection by the chemoattractant leukotriene (LT)B4 that is biosynthesized by 5-lipoxygenase and LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4H). Here, we identified gliotoxin as inhibitor of LTA4H that selectively abrogates LTB4 formation in human leukocytes and in distinct animal models. Gliotoxin failed to inhibit the formation of other eicosanoids and the aminopeptidase activity of the bifunctional LTA4H. Suppression of LTB4 formation by gliotoxin required the cellular environment and/or reducing conditions, and only the reduced form of gliotoxin inhibited LTA4H activity. Conclusively, gliotoxin suppresses the biosynthesis of the potent neutrophil chemoattractant LTB4 by direct interference with LTA4H thereby impairing neutrophil functions in invasive aspergillosis.

Abstract: Summary
Contractile to synthetic phenotypic switching of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contributes to stenosis in vascular disease and vascular transplants. To generate more contractile SMCs, we performed a high-throughput differentiation screen using a MYH11-NLuc-tdTomato human embryonic stem cell reporter cell line. We identified RepSox as a factor that promotes differentiation of MYH11-positive cells by promoting NOTCH signaling. RepSox induces SMCs to exhibit a more contractile phenotype than SMCs generated using PDGF-BB and TGF-β1, two factors previously used for SMC differentiation but which also cause intimal hyperplasia. In addition, RepSox inhibited intimal hyperplasia caused by contractile to synthetic phenotypic switching of SMCs in a rat balloon injury model. Thus, in addition to providing more contractile SMCs that could prove useful for constructing artificial blood vessels, this study suggests a strategy for identifying drugs for inhibiting intimal hyperplasia that act by driving contractile differentiation rather than inhibiting proliferation non-specifically.

Abstract: Summary
Cell cycle progression and cell fate decisions are closely linked in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). However, the study of these interplays at the molecular level remains challenging due to the lack of efficient methods allowing cell cycle synchronization of large quantities of cells. Here, we screened inhibitors of cell cycle progression and identified nocodazole as the most efficient small molecule to synchronize hPSCs in the G2/M phase. Following nocodazole treatment, hPSCs remain pluripotent, retain a normal karyotype and can successfully differentiate into the three germ layers and functional cell types. Moreover, genome-wide transcriptomic analyses on single cells synchronized for their cell cycle and differentiated toward the endoderm lineage validated our findings and showed that nocodazole treatment has no effect on gene expression during the differentiation process. Thus, our synchronization method provides a robust approach to study cell cycle mechanisms in hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The transplantation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived insulin-producing β cells for the treatment of diabetes is finally approaching the clinical stage. However, even with state-of-the-art differentiation protocols, a significant percentage of undefined non-endocrine cell types are still generated. Most importantly, there is the potential for carry-over of non-differentiated cell types that may produce teratomas. We sought to modify hESCs so that their differentiated progeny could be selectively devoid of tumorigenic cells and enriched for cells of the desired phenotype (in this case, β cells). Here we report the generation of a modified hESC line harboring two suicide gene cassettes, whose expression results in cell death in the presence of specific pro-drugs. We show the efficacy of this system at enriching for β cells and eliminating tumorigenic ones both in vitro and in vivo. Our approach is innovative inasmuch as it allows for the preservation of the desired cells while eliminating those with the potential to develop teratomas.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquinone (UQ) is a polyprenylated lipid that is conserved from bacteria to humans and is crucial to cellular respiration. How the cell orchestrates the efficient synthesis of UQ, which involves the modification of extremely hydrophobic substrates by multiple sequential enzymes, remains an unresolved issue. Here, we demonstrate that seven Ubi proteins form the Ubi complex, a stable metabolon that catalyzes the last six reactions of the UQ biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli. The SCP2 domain of UbiJ forms an extended hydrophobic cavity that binds UQ intermediates inside the 1-MDa Ubi complex. We purify the Ubi complex from cytoplasmic extracts and demonstrate that UQ biosynthesis occurs in this fraction, challenging the current thinking of a membrane-associated biosynthetic process. Collectively, our results document a rare case of stable metabolon and highlight how the supramolecular organization of soluble enzymes allows the modification of hydrophobic substrates in a hydrophilic environment.

Abstract: Summary
Heterozygous de novo mutations in GATA6 are the most frequent cause of pancreatic agenesis in humans. In mice, however, a similar phenotype requires the biallelic loss of Gata6 and its paralog Gata4. To elaborate the human-specific requirements for GATA6, we chose to model GATA6 loss in vitro by combining both gene-edited and patient-derived pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and directed differentiation toward β-like cells. We find that GATA6 heterozygous hPSCs show a modest reduction in definitive endoderm (DE) formation, while GATA6-null hPSCs fail to enter the DE lineage. Consistent with these results, genome-wide studies show that GATA6 binds and cooperates with EOMES/SMAD2/3 to regulate the expression of cardinal endoderm genes. The early deficit in DE is accompanied by a significant reduction in PDX1+ pancreatic progenitors and C-PEPTIDE+ β-like cells. Taken together, our data position GATA6 as a gatekeeper to early human, but not murine, pancreatic ontogeny.

Abstract: Direct current electric field (DC EF) plays a role in influencing the biological behaviors and functions of cells. We hypothesize that human astrocytes (HAs) could also be influenced in EF. Astrocytes, an important type of nerve cells with a high proportion quantitatively, are generally activated and largely decide the brain repair results after brain injury. So far, no electrotaxis study on HAs has been performed. We here obtained HAs derived from brain trauma patients. After purification and identification, HAs were seeded in the EF chamber and recorded in a time-lapse image system. LY294002 and U0126 were then used to probe the role of PI3K or ERK signaling pathway on cellular behaviors. The results showed that HAs could be guided to migrate to the anode in DC EFs, in a voltage-dependent manner. The HAs displayed elongated cell bodies and reoriented perpendicularly to the EF in morphology. When treated with LY294002 or U0126, alternation of parameters such as cellular verticality, track speed, displacement speed, long axis, vertical length and circularity were inhibited partly as expected, while the EF-induced directedness was not terminated even at a high drug dosage which was not consistent with previous electrotaxis studies. In conclusion, applied EFs steered the patient-derived HAs directional migration and changed morphology, in which PI3K and ERK pathways at least partially participate. The characteristics of HAs to EF stimulation may be involved in wound healing and neural regeneration, which could be utilized as a novel treatment strategy in brain injury.

Abstract: Summary
The hostile environment of an injured spinal cord makes it challenging to achieve higher viability in a grafted tissue-engineered neural network used to reconstruct the spinal cord circuit. Here, we investigate whether cell survival and synaptic transmission within an NT-3 and TRKC gene-overexpressing neural stem cell-derived neural network scaffold (NN) transplanted into transected spinal cord could be promoted by electroacupuncture (EA) through improving the microenvironment. Our results showed that EA facilitated the cell survival, neuronal differentiation, and synapse formation of a transplanted NN. Pseudorabies virus tracing demonstrated that EA strengthened synaptic integration of the transplanted NN with the host neural circuit. The combination therapy also promoted axonal regeneration, spinal conductivity, and functional recovery. The findings highlight EA as a potential and safe supplementary therapeutic strategy to reinforce the survival and synaptogenesis of a transplanted NN as a neuronal relay to bridge the two severed ends of an injured spinal cord.

Abstract: Insects are often exposed to high temperature stress in natural environments, but the mechanisms involved in thermotolerance in many insect groups like Hemiptera are not well known. To explore possible mechanisms of thermotolerance in the hemipteran pest Laodelphax striatellus, which damages rice through direct feeding and viral transmission, small heat shock proteins (sHsps) implicated in thermotolerance in other insect groups were identified. The seven sHsps identified have a conserved alpha crystallin domain, a variable N-terminal region, and shared relative low identities to each other. Three of the sHsp genes (LsHsp20.5, LsHsp21.5, and LsHsp21.6) exhibited higher basal expression than the other four genes but showed weak or no heat-induced expression. The other four genes (LsHsp20.1, LsHsp21.2, LsHsp21.4, and LsHsp22.0) were induced up to 3306-fold by heat. Injection of dsRNA indicated that expression of these sHsps was associated with thermotolerance, and Escherichia coli transformed with LsHsp21.2 and LsHsp20.1 showed relatively higher thermotolerance. These results point to an important functional role of these sHsps for thermotolerance in L. striatellus.

Abstract: Summary
Clostridium difficile causes increasing numbers of life-threatening intestinal infections. Symptoms associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) are mediated by secreted protein toxins, whose virulence is modulated by intracellular auto-proteolysis following allosteric activation of their protease domains by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). Here, we explore the possibility of inactivating the C. difficile toxin B (TcdB) by triggering its auto-proteolysis in the gut lumen prior to cell uptake using gain-of-function small molecules. We anticipated that high calcium concentrations typically found in the gut would strongly chelate IP6, precluding it from pre-emptively inducing toxin auto-proteolysis if administered exogenously. We therefore designed IP6 analogs with reduced susceptibility to complexation by calcium, which maintained allosteric activity at physiological calcium concentrations. We found that oral administration of IP6 analogs attenuated inflammation and promoted survival in mouse models of CDI. Our data provide impetus to further develop small-molecule allosteric triggers of toxin auto-proteolysis as a therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEs), a pigmented cell layer in the outer retina, are constantly exposed to photo-oxidative stress. Autophagy relieves the stress by removing oxidative protein adducts, protein aggregates, and damaged mitochondria. We previously found that miR-29 is downregulated in choroid/RPE tissue in a model of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), suggesting that miR-29 deficiency may contribute to autophagy inhibition and AMD progression. Here we wanted to test whether overexpression of miR-29 in RPEs could enhance autophagy, thereby facilitating removal of drusen components. Indeed, overexpression of miR-29 in the RPEs increased autophagy, assessed by decreased protein levels of p62, increased lipid form of microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3-II), and elevated autophagy flux. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-29 mitigated the formation of mutant αB-crystallin (R120G) protein aggregates. In probing the mechanism, we demonstrated that miR-29 post-transcriptionally repressed LAMPTOR1/p18 via targeting its 3’-UTRs of messenger RNA. MiR-29 overexpression and knockdown of LAMPTOR1/p18 led to limited mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes and inhibition of mTORC1 activity. Altogether, miR-29 enhances autophagy which aids in removal of protein aggregates. These findings reveal a novel role of miR-29, which has the potential of being a therapeutic strategy for rescuing RPE degeneration in ocular disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from autosomal dominant mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, leading to a hyperactivated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and gray and white matter defects in the brain. To study the involvement of neuron-glia interactions in TSC phenotypes, we generated TSC patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neuronal and oligodendrocyte (OL) cultures. TSC neuron mono-cultures showed increased network activity, as measured by calcium transients and action potential firing, and increased dendritic branching. However, in co-cultures with OLs, neuronal defects became more apparent, showing cellular hypertrophy and increased axonal density. In addition, TSC neuron-OL co-cultures showed increased OL cell proliferation and decreased OL maturation. Pharmacological intervention with the mTOR regulator rapamycin suppressed these defects. Our patient iPSC-based model, therefore, shows a complex cellular TSC phenotype arising from the interaction of neuronal and glial cells and provides a platform for TSC disease modeling and drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how epithelial progenitors within exocrine glands establish specific cell lineages and form complex functional secretory units is vital for organ regeneration. Here we identify the transcription factor Sox10 as essential for both the maintenance and differentiation of epithelial KIT+FGFR2b+ progenitors into secretory units, containing acinar, myoepithelial, and intercalated duct cells. The KIT/FGFR2b-Sox10 axis marks the earliest multi-potent and tissue-specific progenitors of exocrine glands. Genetic deletion of epithelial Sox10 leads to loss of secretory units, which reduces organ size and function, but the ductal tree is retained. Intriguingly, the remaining duct progenitors do not compensate for loss of Sox10 and lack plasticity to properly form secretory units. However, overexpression of Sox10 in these ductal progenitors enhances their plasticity toward KIT+ progenitors and induces differentiation into secretory units. Therefore, Sox10 controls plasticity and multi-potency of epithelial KIT+ cells in secretory organs, such as mammary, lacrimal, and salivary glands.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoiesis is arguably one of the best understood stem cell systems; however, significant challenges remain to reach a consensus understanding of the lineage potential, heterogeneity, and relationships of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations. To gain new insights, we performed quantitative analyses of mature cell production from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multiple hematopoietic progenitor populations. Assessment of the absolute numbers of mature cell types produced by each progenitor cell revealed a striking erythroid dominance of all myeloid-competent progenitors assessed, accompanied by strong platelet reconstitution. All populations with myeloid potential also produced robust numbers of red blood cells and platelets in vivo. Clonal analysis by single-cell transplantation and by spleen colony assays revealed that a significant fraction of HSCs and multipotent progenitors have multilineage potential at the single-cell level. These new insights prompt an erythroid-focused model of hematopoietic differentiation.

Abstract: Post-translational modifications of the histone H2A represent an important mechanism by which cells modulate the structure and function of chromatin. Ubiquitination at K119 of histone H2A is associated transcriptional repression, which is shown to be regulated by deubiquitinases (DUBs). Here, we performed a screen to identify novel DUBs for histone H2A. Although RNAi-mediated knockdown of USP28, USP32 and USP36 showed that their depletion resulted in the increase of ub-K119-H2A, only USP28-depleted cells showed increased cell proliferation. Notably, USP28 knockdown cells had decreased expression of p53, p21 and p16INK4a, suggesting that the effect of USP28 on cell proliferation was mediated by regulating the expression of p53, p21 and p16INK4a. In summary, we have shown that USP28 is a deubiquitinase for histone H2A and is involved in regulation of cell proliferation. Thus, USP28 represents a potentially novel therapeutic target for cancer.

Abstract: Very promising results have been observed with a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine based on human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) antigen retention and delivery system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the mechanism by which these antigens are processed once they reach this organelle is still unknown. Therefore, we evaluated whether this system awakens a stress response in the ER. Different DNA constructs based on E6 and E7 mutant antigens fused to an ER signal peptide (SP), a signal for retention in the ER (KDEL), or both signals (SPK), were transfected into HEK-293 cells. Overexpression of E6 and E7 antigens targeted to the ER (SP, and SPK constructs) induced ER stress, which was indicated by an increase of the ER-stress markers GRP78/BiP and CHOP. Additionally, the ER stress response was mediated by the ATF4 transcription factor, which was translocated into the nucleus. Besides, the overexpressed antigens were degraded by the proteasome. Through a cycloheximide-chase assay, we demonstrated that when both protein synthesis and proteasome were inhibited, the overexpressed antigens were degraded. Interestingly, when proteasome was blocked autophagy was increased and the ER stress response decreased. Taken together, these results indicate that the antigens are initially degraded by the ERAD pathway, and autophagy degradation pathway can be induced to compensate the proteasome inhibition. Therefore, we provided a new insight into the mechanism by which E6 and E7 mutant antigens are processed once they reach the ER, which will help to improve the development of more effective vaccines against cancer.

Abstract: JAK/STAT pathway is one among the several oxidative stress-responsive signaling pathways that play a critical role in facilitating cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Cisplatin treatment decreases the levels of cochlear LMO4, which acts as a scaffold for IL6-GP130 protein complex. Cisplatin-induced nitration and degradation of LMO4 could destabilize this protein complex, which in turn could compromise the downstream STAT3-mediated cellular defense mechanism. Here, we investigated the link between cisplatin-induced nitrative stress and STAT3-mediated apoptosis by using organ of Corti cell cultures. SRI110, a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst that prevented cisplatin-induced decrease in LMO4 levels and ototoxicity, was used to inhibit nitrative stress. Immunoblotting and immunostaining indicated that cisplatin treatment decreased the expression levels, phosphorylation, and nuclear localization of STAT3 in UB/OC1 cells. Inhibition of nitration by SRI110 co-treatment prevented cisplatin-induced inactivation of STAT3 and promoted its nuclear localization. SRI110 co-treatment reversed the cisplatin-induced changes in the expression levels of Bcl2l1, Ccnd1, Jak2, Jak3, and Src and significantly attenuated the changes in the expression levels of Cdkn1a, Egfr, Fas, Il6st, Jak1, Stat3, and Tyk2. Collectively, these results suggest that the inhibition of cisplatin-induced nitration prevents the inactivation of STAT3, which in turn enables the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes and thereby helps to mitigate cisplatin-induced toxicity.

Abstract: Synthetic tubugis are equally potent but more stable than their natural forms. Their anticancer potential was estimated on a solid melanoma in vitro and in vivo. Tubugi-1 induced the apoptosis in B16 cells accompanied with strong intracellular production of reactive species, subsequently imposing glutathione and thiol group depletion. Paradoxically, membrane lipids were excluded from the cascade of intracellular oxidation, according to malondialdehyde decrease. Although morphologically apoptosis was typical, externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) as an early apoptotic event was not detected. Even their exposition is pivotal for apoptotic cell eradication, primary macrophages successfully eliminated PS-deficient tubugi-1 induced apoptotic cells. The tumor volume in animals exposed to the drug in therapeutic mode was reduced in comparison to control as well as to paclitaxel-treated animals. Importantly, macrophages isolated from tubugi-1 treated animals possessed conserved phagocytic activity and were functionally and phenotypically recognized as M1. The cytotoxic effect of tubugi-1 is accomplished through its ability to polarize the macrophages toward M1, probably by PS independent apoptotic cell engulfment. The unique potential of tubugi-1 to prime the innate immune response through the induction of a specific pattern of tumor cell apoptosis can be of extraordinary importance from fundamental and applicable aspects.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of the cell cycle characterizes many cancer subtypes, providing a rationale for developing cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. Potent CDK2 inhibitors might target certain cancers in which CCNE1 is amplified. However, current CDK2 inhibitors also inhibit CDK1, generating a toxicity liability. We have used biophysical measurements and X-ray crystallography to investigate the ATP-competitive inhibitor binding properties of cyclin-free and cyclin-bound CDK1 and CDK2. We show that these kinases can readily be distinguished by such inhibitors when cyclin-free, but not when cyclin-bound. The basis for this discrimination is unclear from either inspection or molecular dynamics simulation of ligand-bound CDKs, but is reflected in the contacts made between the kinase N- and C-lobes. We conclude that there is a subtle but profound difference between the conformational energy landscapes of cyclin-free CDK1 and CDK2. The unusual properties of CDK1 might be exploited to differentiate CDK1 from other CDKs in future cancer therapeutic design.

Abstract: Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) is the main type of Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and is a common otorhinolaryngologic disease worldwide. However, the mechanisms of CRSsNP remain poorly understood. In this study, C57BL/6J wild-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene knockout (uPA-/-) mice were used to construct the CRSsNP model. Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) were isolated from CRSsNP patient and treated with uPA knockdown/overexpression lentivirus. CCK-8 and Annexin-V/PI staining were used to detected cell proliferation and apoptosis. In vivo, we found that uPA depletion alleviated mucosal inflammation in the CRSsNP mice model. Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) was upregulated in the uPA-/- CRSsNP mice model. In vitro, inhibition of uPA increased cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, uPA depletion upregulated WIF1 and BCL2 expression, and reduced the expression level of BAX in CRSsNP HNEC. In contrast, decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis were observed after uPA overexpression. Consistently, a reduction in WIF1 and BCL2 expression levels and an increase in the BAX expression level were observed upon uPA ectopic expression. Furthermore, WIF1 overexpression rescued the effects caused by uPA overexpression in vitro. In conclusion, uPA affects the CRSsNP nasal mucosal epithelium cell apoptosis by upregulating WIF1. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the role of uPA in CRSsNP to date.

Abstract: Summary
Endocytosis is implicated in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency, although its exact role and the identity of molecular players remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), is vital for maintaining mouse ESC (mESC) pluripotency. Knockdown of Cltc resulted in a loss of pluripotency accompanied by reduced E-cadherin (E-CAD) levels and increased levels of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. We demonstrate that both E-CAD and TGF-β receptor type 1 (TGF-βR1) are internalized through CME in mESCs. While E-CAD is recycled, TGF-βR1 is targeted for lysosomal degradation thus maintaining inverse levels of these molecules. Finally, we show that E-CAD interacts with ERK, and that the decreased pluripotency upon CME loss can be rescued by inhibiting TGF-βR, MEK, and GSK3β, or overexpressing E-CAD. Our results demonstrate that CME is critical for balancing signaling outputs to regulate ESC pluripotency, and possibly cell fate choices in early development.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system, and chemoresistance blunts the effect of temozolomide (TMZ) in the treatment of GBM. Clarifying the underlying mechanism of chemoresistance might yield novel strategies to improve the patients’ response to chemotherapeutics. Mounting evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in chemoresistance and tumorigenesis. At present, miR-7-5p has been recognized as a tumor suppressor involved in multiple cancers. However, the biological effects of miR-7-5p in TMZ resistance have not been illuminated. In this study, we used RNA sequencing and high-throughput screening techniques, which revealed that miR-7-5p is significantly downregulated in TMZ resistant LN229 cells (LN229/TMZ-R) compared to control cells (LN229), and low miR-7-5p expression was correlated with recurrence in GBM patients. Ectopic overexpression of miR-7-5p sensitized LN229/TMZ-R cells to TMZ and suppressed the stemness of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Further experiments demonstrated that miR-7-5p exerts its role by directly targeting the 3′-untranslated region of Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Our findings suggest that combinational use of miR-7-5p and TMZ might be a promising therapeutic strategy to increase the long-term drug response in GBM patients.

Abstract: Comparison of studies of cells derived from normal and pathological tissues of the same organ can be fraught with difficulties, particular with cancer where a number of different diseases are considered cancer within the same tissue. In the thyroid, there are 4 main types of cancer, three of which arise from follicular epithelial cells; papillary and follicular which are classified as differentiated, and anaplastic which is classified as undifferentiated. One assay that can be utilised for isolation of cancer stem cells is the side population (SP) assay. However, SP studies have been limited in part due to lack of optimal isolation strategies and in the case of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) are further compounded by lack of access to ATC tumors. We have used thyroid cell lines to determine the optimal conditions to isolate viable SP cells. We then compared SP cells and NSP cells (bulk tumour cells without the SP) of a normal thyroid cell line N-thy ori-3-1 and an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line SW1736 and showed that both SP cell populations displayed higher levels of stem cell characteristics than the NSP. When we compared SP cells of the N-thy ori-3-1 and the SW1736, the SW1736 SP had a higher colony forming potential, expressed higher levels of stem cell markers and CXCR4 and where more migratory and invasive, invasiveness increasing in response to CXCL12. This is the first report showing functional differences between ATC SP and normal thyroid SP and could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets to treat ATC.

Abstract: Summary
The global virome is largely uncharacterized but is now being unveiled by metagenomic DNA sequencing. Exploring the human respiratory virome, in particular, can provide insights into oro-respiratory diseases. Here, we use metagenomics to identify a family of small circular DNA viruses—named Redondoviridae—associated with human diseases. We first identified two redondovirus genomes from bronchoalveolar lavage samples from human lung donors. We then queried thousands of metagenomic samples and recovered 17 additional complete redondovirus genomes. Detections were exclusively in human samples and mostly from respiratory tract and oro-pharyngeal sites, where Redondoviridae was the second most prevalent eukaryotic DNA virus family. Redondovirus sequences were associated with periodontal disease, and abundances decreased with treatment. Some critically ill patients in a medical intensive care unit were found to harbor high levels of redondoviruses in respiratory samples. These results suggest that redondoviruses colonize human oro-respiratory sites and can bloom in several human disorders.

Abstract: Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the loss of immune tolerance to self-antigens which leads to an excessive immune responses and chronic inflammation. Although much progress has been made in revealing key players in pathophysiology of various autoimmune diseases, their therapy remains challenging and consists of conventional immunosuppressive treatments, including corticosteroids and more advanced biological therapies which are targeted at molecules involved in maintaining chronic inflammation. These therapies are focused on suppressing inflammation; nevertheless, a permanent balance between protective and pathogenic immune responses is not achieved. In addition, most of currently available therapies for autoimmune diseases induce severe side effects. Consequently, more effective and safer therapies are still required to control autoimmunity. Stress-induced cell protecting heat shock proteins (HSP) have been considered as a potential treatment targets for autoimmune diseases. HSP, predominantly intracellular components, might be released from bacteria or mammalian tissues and activate immune response. This activation may lead to either production of (auto)antibodies against HSP and/or induction of immune regulatory mechanisms, including expansion of desired T regulatory (Treg) cells. Because inadequate frequency or activity of Treg is a characteristic feature of autoimmune diseases, targeting this cell population is an important focus of immunotherapy approaches in autoimmunity.

Abstract: High expression of the oncogene ecotropic viral integration site-1 (EVI-1) is an independent negative prognostic indicator of survival in leukemia patients. This study aimed to examine the effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on EVI-1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow and peripheral blood of AML patients and healthy donors. EVI-1 expression in hematopoietic cells was evaluated by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. EVI-1 was highly expressed in both primary AML and leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and K562). ATO down-regulated EVI-1 mRNA in zebrafish in vivo as well as in primary leukemia cells and THP-1 and K562 cells in vitro. Additionally, ATO treatment induced apoptosis, down-regulated both EVI-1 mRNA and oncoprotein expression, increased the expression of pro-apoptosis proteins, and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in leukemia cells in vitro. EVI-1 expression in leukemia cells (THP-1 and K562) transduced with EVI-1 siRNA was significantly reduced. Silencing EVI-1 had a significant effect on the activation of the JNK pathway and the induction of leukemia cell apoptosis. ATO may downregulate EVI-1 mRNA and oncoprotein levels and block the inhibitory effects of EVI-1 on the JNK pathway, which activates the JNK apoptotic pathway, thereby leading to the apoptosis of EVI-1 in AML patients.

Abstract: Summary
Satellite cells are responsible for skeletal muscle regeneration. Upon activation, they proliferate as transient amplifying myoblasts, most of which fuse into regenerating myofibers. Despite their remarkable differentiation potential, these cells have limited migration capacity, which curtails clinical use for widespread forms of muscular dystrophy. Conversely, skeletal muscle perivascular cells have less myogenic potential but better migration capacity than satellite cells. Here we show that modulation of Notch and PDGF pathways, involved in developmental specification of pericytes, induces perivascular cell features in adult mouse and human satellite cell-derived myoblasts. DLL4 and PDGF-BB-treated cells express markers of perivascular cells and associate with endothelial networks while also upregulating markers of satellite cell self-renewal. Moreover, treated cells acquire trans-endothelial migration ability while remaining capable of engrafting skeletal muscle upon intramuscular transplantation. These results extend our understanding of muscle stem cell fate plasticity and provide a druggable pathway with clinical relevance for muscle cell therapy.

Abstract: Cetuximab, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor that is used widely to treat human cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), has characteristic side effects of skin rash and hypomagnesemia. However, the mechanisms of and therapeutic agents for skin rashes and hypomagnesemia are still poorly understood. Our gene expression profiling analyses showed that cetuximab activates the p38 MAPK pathways in human skin cells (human keratinocyte cell line [HaCaT]) and inhibits c-Fos-related signals in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). We found that while the p38 inhibitor SB203580 inhibited the expression of p38 MAPK targets in HaCaT cells, flavagline reactivated c-Fos-related factors in HEK293 cells. It is noteworthy that, in addition to not interfering with the effect of cetuximab by both compounds, flavagline has additive effect for OSCC growth inhibition in vivo. Collectively, our results indicate that combination of cetuximab and these potential therapeutic agents for cetuximab-related toxicities could be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with OSCC.

Abstract: Studies have described the presence of pluripotent markers in vivo and in vitro in human amnion. However, the amnion can be divided into reflected, placental and umbilical regions that are anatomically and functionally heterogeneous. Here, we evaluated the expression of pluripotency markers in tissue and cultivated cells in vitro of different regions of human amnion. To this end, we determined the presence of the core pluripotency factors OCT-4, NANOG and SOX-2 by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR and also performed transcriptome analysis of the different regions of amnion tissue. We identified the mRNA and protein of the pluripotency factors in the different regions of human amnion tissue. However, the OCT-4 and NANOG immunolocalization was cytoplasmic, whereas SOX-2 immunolocalization was nuclear regardless of the region analyzed. Moreover, we found three subpopulations of cells in the in vitro cultures of reflected and placental amnion: cells with immunostaining only in the nucleus, only in the cytoplasm, or in both compartments. Yet no statistically significant differences were found between the reflected and placental amnion. These results suggest a homogeneous distribution of the pluripotency transcription factors of the different regions of human amnion to isolate stem cells that can be used in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Ring finger protein 6 (RNF6), a RING-domain E3 ubiquitin Ligase, functions as a potential tumor promoter in several caners. However, the function and clinical significance of RNF6 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we found that high RNF6 expression was detected frequently in primary HCC tissues, and was closely associated with malignant phenotype and shorter survival among the HCC patients. Multivariate analyses also revealed that RNF6 overexpression was independent prognostic factors for poor outcome of patients with HCC. Further, RNF6 knockdown notably inhibited the metastasis abilities of HCC in vivo and in vitro. RNF6 silence also suppressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and radioresistance in HCC. Mechanistically, our results demonstrated that RNF6 directly bound and ubiquitylated Forkhead box protein A1 (FoxA1), an important transcriptional repressor of EMT process. Additionally, our data shown that the oncogenic effect of RNF6 in HCC is partially dependent on FoxA1 degradation. Collectively, our data suggest that RNF6 plays a crucial oncogenic role in HCC tumorigenesis, and we provide a novel evidence that RNF6 may be serve as a prognostic and therapeutic target for HCC progression.

Abstract: Summary
Protein- and cell-based immunotherapeutic agents have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, small-molecule immunomodulators with favorable pharmacological properties for reaching intracellular targets remain to be developed. To explore the vast chemical space, a robust method that recapitulates the complex cancer-immune microenvironment in a high-throughput format is essential. To address this critical gap, we developed a high-throughput immunomodulator phenotypic screening platform, HTiP, which integrates the immune and cancer cell co-culture system with imaging- and biochemical-based multiplexed readouts. Using the HTiP platform, we have demonstrated its capability in modeling an oncogenic KRAS mutation-driven immunosuppressive phenotype. From a bioactive chemical library, multiple structurally distinct compounds were identified, all of which target the same class of proteins, inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP). IAP has demonstrated roles in cancer immunity. Identification of IAP antagonists as potent anti-tumor immune enhancers provides strong validating evidence for the use of the HTiP platform to discover small-molecule immunomodulators.

Abstract: The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and heat shock cognate proteins (Hsc70) have been identified as chaperones of the ecdysone receptor (EcR)/ultraspiracle protein (USP) heterocomplex. However, little is known about the status of Hsp90 and Hsc70 in Polyrhachis vicina Roger. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of adult ants in P. vicina for the first time. Clean reads in female, male, and worker ants were annotated into 40,147 transcripts, and 37,488, 28,300, and 33,638 unigenes were assembled in female, male, and worker ants, respectively. According to RPKM, the numbers of differentially expressed genes between female and male ants, between female and worker ants, and between male and worker ants and the common differentially expressed genes were 12,657, 21,630, 15,112 and 3704, respectively. These results reveal that caste differentiation, caste specificity formation, and social divisions of P. vicina ants may be due to gene expression differences. Moreover, PvEcR and PvUSP were also detected as differentially expressed genes in the ants; specifically, PvUSP expression was higher than PvEcR expression in all castes. We speculate that PvUSP may have a role similar to that of juvenile hormone receptor. Four identified PvHsp90 family members and 23 identified PvHsp70 family members were found in the ants, and 2 PvHsp90 genes and 8 PvHsp70 genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Among those genes, the expression of 2 PvHsp90 genes and 5 PvHsp70 genes coincided with the expression profiles of PvEcR and PvUSP, which suggest that the characterization of PvHsp90 and PvHsc70 may be as EcR/USP molecular chaperones in P. vicina.

Abstract: D-type cyclins are important regulatory proteins of the G1/S phase of the cell cycle however, their specific functions are only partially understood. We show that silencing of individual D-type cyclins has no effect on the proliferation and morphology of Immortalized non-tumorigenic human epidermal (HaCaT) cells, while double and triple D cyclin silencing results in the failure of the cytokinesis leading to the appearance of large multinucleated cells. Both CDC20 and Ki67 mRNA is downregulated in these cells. Ki67 mRNA silenced cells show similar multinucleated cellular phenotype as double or triple D cyclin silenced cells without affecting D cyclin expression, suggesting that Ki67 is necessary for normal G2/M transition. Our data have revealed that cyclin D1 may have a leading role in G1/S phase regulation and suggest an incomplete functional overlap among D cyclins. Our results indicate that beside their well-known functions during the G0-G1/S phase, D-type cyclins play a pivotal role in the regulation of mitosis via influencing Ki67 expression in a downstream manner probably through E2F1 activation in HaCaT cells.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon (IFN-I) is critical for antiviral defense, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a predominant source of IFN-I during virus infection. pDC-mediated antiviral responses are stimulated upon physical contact with infected cells, during which immunostimulatory viral RNA is transferred to pDCs, leading to IFN production via the nucleic acid sensor TLR7. Using dengue, hepatitis C, and Zika viruses, we demonstrate that the contact site of pDCs with infected cells is a specialized platform we term the interferogenic synapse, which enables viral RNA transfer and antiviral responses. This synapse is formed via αLβ2 integrin-ICAM-1 adhesion complexes and the recruitment of the actin network and endocytic machinery. TLR7 signaling in pDCs promotes interferogenic synapse establishment and provides feed-forward regulation, sustaining pDC contacts with infected cells. This interferogenic synapse may allow pDCs to scan infected cells and locally secrete IFN-I, thereby confining a potentially deleterious response.

Abstract: Summary
Detection of dynamic protein-protein interactions within complexes and networks remains a challenging task. Here, we show by the example of the proteolytic ClpXP complex the utility of combined chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to map interactions within ClpP and ClpX as well as across the enigmatic ClpX hexamer-ClpP heptamer interface. A few hot-spot lysines located in signature loops in ClpX were shown to be in proximity to several structural regions of ClpP providing an initial draft of the ClpX-ClpP interaction. Application of XL-MS further confirmed that Listeria monocytogenes ClpX interacts with the heterooligomeric ClpP1/2 complex solely via the ClpP2 apical site. Moreover, cellular interaction networks of human and bacterial proteases were elucidated via in situ chemical cross-linking followed by an antibody-based pull-down against ClpP. A subsequent mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated an up to 3-fold higher coverage compared with co-immunoprecipitation without cross-linker revealing unprecedented insight into intracellular ClpXP networks.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation protocols have generated insulin-producing cells resembling pancreatic β cells. While these stem cell-derived β (SC-β) cells are capable of undergoing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), insulin secretion per cell remains low compared with islets and cells lack dynamic insulin release. Herein, we report a differentiation strategy focused on modulating transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling, controlling cellular cluster size, and using an enriched serum-free media to generate SC-β cells that express β cell markers and undergo GSIS with first- and second-phase dynamic insulin secretion. Transplantation of these cells into mice greatly improves glucose tolerance. These results reveal that specific time frames for inhibiting and permitting TGF-β signaling are required during SC-β cell differentiation to achieve dynamic function. The capacity of these cells to undergo GSIS with dynamic insulin release makes them a promising cell source for diabetes cellular therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Mosquitoes are hematophagous vectors that can acquire human viruses in their intestinal tract. Here, we define a mosquito gut commensal bacterium that promotes permissiveness to arboviruses. Antibiotic depletion of gut bacteria impaired arboviral infection of a lab-adapted Aedes aegypti mosquito strain. Reconstitution of individual cultivable gut bacteria in antibiotic-treated mosquitoes identified Serratia marcescens as a commensal bacterium critical for efficient arboviral acquisition. S. marcescens facilitates arboviral infection through a secreted protein named SmEnhancin, which digests membrane-bound mucins on the mosquito gut epithelia, thereby enhancing viral dissemination. Field Aedes mosquitoes positive for S. marcescens were more permissive to dengue virus infection than those free of S. marcescens. Oral introduction of S. marcescens into field mosquitoes that lack this bacterium rendered these mosquitoes highly susceptible to arboviruses. This study defines a commensal-driven mechanism that contributes to vector competence, and extends our understanding of multipartite interactions among hosts, the gut microbiome, and viruses.

Abstract: Summary
There is a profound need for functional, biomimetic in vitro tissue constructs of the human blood-brain barrier and neurovascular unit (NVU) to model diseases and identify therapeutic interventions. Here, we show that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) exhibit robust barrier functionality when cultured in 3D channels within gelatin hydrogels. We determined that BMECs cultured in 3D under perfusion conditions were 10–100 times less permeable to sodium fluorescein, 3 kDa dextran, and albumin relative to human umbilical vein endothelial cell and human dermal microvascular endothelial cell controls, and the BMECs maintained barrier function for up to 21 days. Analysis of cell-cell junctions revealed expression patterns supporting barrier formation. Finally, efflux transporter activity was maintained over 3 weeks of perfused culture. Taken together, this work lays the foundation for development of a representative 3D in vitro model of the human NVU constructed from iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Primed epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) can be reverted to a pluripotent embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like state by expression of single reprogramming factor. We used CRISPR activation to perform a genome-scale, reprogramming screen in EpiSCs and identified 142 candidate genes. Our screen validated a total of 50 genes, previously not known to contribute to reprogramming, of which we chose Sall1 for further investigation. We show that Sall1 augments reprogramming of mouse EpiSCs and embryonic fibroblasts and that these induced pluripotent stem cells are indeed fully pluripotent including formation of chimeric mice. We also demonstrate that Sall1 synergizes with Nanog in reprogramming and that overexpression in ESCs delays their conversion back to EpiSCs. Lastly, using RNA sequencing, we identify and validate Klf5 and Fam189a2 as new downstream targets of Sall1 and Nanog. In summary, our work demonstrates the power of using CRISPR technology in understanding molecular mechanisms that mediate complex cellular processes such as reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
The expansion of GGGGCC repeats within the first intron of C9ORF72 constitutes the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Through repeat-associated non-ATG translation, these expansions are translated into dipeptide repeats (DPRs), some of which accumulate at nucleoli and lead to cell death. We here performed a chemical screen to identify compounds reducing the toxicity of ALS-related poly(PR) peptides. Our screening identified sodium phenylbutyrate, currently in clinical trials, and BET Bromodomain inhibitors as modifiers of poly(PR) toxicity in cell lines and developing zebrafish embryos. Mechanistically, we show that BET Bromodomain inhibitors rescue the nucleolar stress induced by poly(PR) or actinomycin D, alleviating the effects of the DPR in nucleolus-related functions such as mRNA splicing or translation. Our work suggests that BET Bromodomain inhibitors might have beneficial effects in diseases linked to nucleolar stress such as ALS/FTD.

PPARα suppresses Th17 cell differentiation through IL-6/STAT3/RORγt pathway in experimental autoimmune myocarditis,

Abstract: Family members of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), such as PPARγ, have been shown to be effective in regulating T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation. However, whether PPARα, another important family member of PPARs, contributes to Th17 cell differentiation remains controversial. In the present study, we show that PPARα may be a negative regulator of Th17 cell differentiation. In CD4+ T cells from PPARα knockout mice, PPARα deficiency enhances IL-17 and IL-6 levels and promotes Th17 cell differentiation. In contrast, in CD4+ T cells from wild type mice, PPARα activation suppresses Th17 cell differentiation. Furthermore, IL-6 neutralizing antibody dose-dependently reduces the activity of STAT3 and down-regulates the protein expression of RORγt in CD4+ T cells from PPARα knockout mice but has no effect on that of wild type mice. On the other hand, in isolated CD4+ T cells from experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) rats, PPARα agonist Fenofibrate decreased the expression of IL-17 and RORγt, increased the expression of Foxp3, while PPARα antagonist MK886 reversed these effects. Importantly, in vivo activation of PPARα ameliorates EAM by suppressing Th17 cell differentiation through reducing the expression of RORγt and phosphorylated STAT3 that are upregulated in EAM hearts. These results imply that PPARα suppresses Th17 cell differentiation through IL-6/STAT3/RORγt signaling pathway and suggest that PPARα may become a molecular target for treating autoimmune myocarditis.

Abstract: Summary
The Parkinson disease (PD) genetic LRRK2 gain-of-function mutations may relate to the ER pathological changes seen in PD patients at postmortem. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons with the PD pathogenic LRRK2 G2019S mutation exhibited neurite collapse when challenged with the ER Ca2+ influx sarco/ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (THP). Baseline ER Ca2+ levels measured with the ER Ca2+ indicator CEPIA-ER were lower in LRRK2 G2019S human neurons, including in differentiated midbrain dopamine neurons in vitro. After THP challenge, PD patient-derived neurons displayed increased Ca2+ influx and decreased intracellular Ca2+ buffering upon membrane depolarization. These effects were reversed following LRRK2 mutation correction by antisense oligonucleotides and gene editing. Gene expression analysis in LRRK2 G2019S neurons identified modified levels of key store-operated Ca2+ entry regulators, with no alterations in ER Ca2+ efflux. These results demonstrate PD gene mutation LRRK2 G2019S ER calcium-dependent pathogenic effects in human neurons.

Abstract: Summary
There is a scarcity of pharmacological tools to interrogate protein kinase function in Plasmodium parasites, the causative agent of malaria. Among Plasmodium's protein kinases, those characterized as atypical represent attractive drug targets as they lack sequence similarity to human proteins. Here, we describe takinib as a small molecule to bind the atypical P. falciparum protein kinase 9 (PfPK9). PfPK9 phosphorylates the Plasmodium E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme PfUBC13, which mediates K63-linkage-specific polyubiquitination. Takinib is a potent human TAK1 inhibitor, thus we developed the Plasmodium-selective takinib analog HS220. We demonstrate that takinib and HS220 decrease K63-linked ubiquitination in P. falciparum, suggesting PfPK9 inhibition in cells. Takinib and HS220 induce a unique phenotype where parasite size in hepatocytes increases, yet high compound concentrations decrease the number of parasites. Our studies highlight the role of PK9 in regulating parasite development and the potential of targeting Plasmodium kinases for malaria control.

Abstract: Summary
During somatic cell reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), fibroblasts undergo dynamic molecular changes, including a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and gain of pluripotency; processes that are influenced by Yamanaka factor stoichiometry. For example, in early reprogramming, high KLF4 levels are correlated with the induction of functionally undefined, transiently expressed MET genes. Here, we identified the cell-surface protein TROP2 as a marker for cells with transient MET induction in the high-KLF4 condition. We observed the emergence of cells expressing the pluripotency marker SSEA-1+ mainly from within the TROP2+ fraction. Using TROP2 as a marker in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated candidate screening of MET genes, we identified the transcription factor OVOL1 as a potential regulator of an alternative epithelial cell fate characterized by the expression of non-iPSC MET genes and low cell proliferation. Our study sheds light on how reprogramming factor stoichiometry alters the spectrum of intermediate cell fates, ultimately influencing reprogramming outcomes.

Abstract: Autophagy is commonly described as a cell survival mechanism and has been implicated in chemo- and radioresistance of cancer cells. Whether ionizing radiation induced autophagy triggers tumor cell survival or cell death still remains unclear. In this study the autophagy related proteins Beclin1 and ATG7 were tested as potential targets to sensitize colorectal carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation under normoxic, hypoxic and starvation conditions. Colony formation, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis revealed that knockdown of Beclin1 or ATG7 does not enhance radiosensitivity in HCT-116 cells. Furthermore, ATG7 knockdown led to an increased survival fraction under oxygen and glutamine starvation, indicating that ionizing radiation indeed induces autophagy which, however, leads to cell death finally. These results highlight that inhibition of autophagic pathways does not generally increase therapy success but may also lead to an unfavorable outcome especially under amino acid and oxygen restriction.

Abstract: Growth-arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers. GAS5 has been reported to be down-regulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of how GAS5 acts as a tumor suppressor in OSCC. qRT-PCR, cell viability, wound-healing, and transwell assays showed that knockdown of GAS5 increased miR-21 expression and promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of OSCC cells. In contrast, overexpression of GAS5 showed the opposite effects. Furthermore, miR-21 overexpression reversed the effect of GAS5. Western blot showed that knockdown of GAS5 suppressed PTEN, while phosphorylation of Akt was promoted. PCNA, cyclinD1, and Ki-67 were up-regulated, indicating enhanced proliferation. E-cadherin was down-regulated, while N-cadherin, vimentin, and snail1 were increased, indicating augmented epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Overexpression of GAS5 regulated these proteins inversely. Overexpression of miR-21 reversed the effect of GAS5 on these proteins. Taken together, GAS5 suppresses proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in OSCC through the miR-21/PTEN axis and might be a novel therapeutic target for OSCC.

Abstract: Neural vascular barrier maintains the optimal tissue microenvironment of central nervous system in which neural cells can function normally. In various neural diseases, the decrease in oxygen concentration, hypoxia, of affected tissues is known to accelerate the disease progression through disruption of neural vascular barrier. Therefore, the clarification of mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced disruption of neural vascular barrier would definitely lead to the establishment of new effective therapies for intractable neural diseases. In the present study, we first found that hypoxia disrupts neural vascular barrier through pathways independent of HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Then, with a specific fluorescence probe for ferrous, Fe(II) ion, we have obtained the interesting data showing that hypoxia increased the intracellular level of Fe(II) ion in endothelial cells of our in vitro model for neural vascular barrier, and that hypoxia-induced disruption of neural vascular barrier could be inhibited by chelating Fe(II) ion in endothelial cells. Furthermore, in the presence of a reducing reagent for reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia could not disrupt the neural vascular barrier despite that the hypoxic increase in intracellular level of Fe(II) ion was confirmed in endothelial cells. These results indicate that hypoxia-triggered increase in the level of intracellular Fe(II) ion and subsequent production of ROS, probably through Fenton reaction, are the essential pathway mediating the disruption of neural vascular barrier under hypoxia.

Abstract: The expression of Notch1 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of various tumors. Previous studies have shown that Notch1 plays a negative regulatory role in response to radiation-induced DNA damage responses. It also has been reported that Notch1 was highly expressed in cervical cancer. It is well known that the first-line chemotherapy drug for treating cervical cancer, cisplatin, targets double-stranded DNA and induces apoptosis in the cells. However, the tolerability of cisplatin is an issue to overcome in the treatment of cervical cancer. Cisplatin has been reported to induce the up-regulation of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) through the γ-proteolytic enzyme complex, a complex that mediates Notch1 activation. Therefore, whether Notch1 is highly expressed in the cells or cisplatin induced high expression of NICD in cervical cancer has not been specifically discussed in these studies. More importantly, whether the inhibition of Notch1 activation would enhance DNA damage induced by cisplatin and/or cellular apoptosis mediated via ATM/CHK2/P53 pathway has not been reported in cervical cancer. In this study, we observed an enhanced DNA damage and cellular apoptosis via the ATM/CHK2/P53 pathway(s) in HeLa and SiHa cells treated with cisplatin combined with DAPT of Notch1 inhibitor. Our findings provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cervical cancer in the clinic.

Abstract: CSTP1, a recently identified protein phosphotase, is frequently repressed in bladder cancers. Previous results showed that CSTP1 over-expression inhibited cell cycle progression and promoted apoptosis through dephosphorylating Akt kinase at Ser473 site in bladder cancer cells, but the mechanisms how CSTP1 exerted tumor suppressive activity remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profile changes that affected by CSTP1 overexpression by microarray, and reported that CSTP1 decreased IL-6 expression/secretion in bladder cancer cells and re-expression of IL-6 abrogated CSTP1's tumor suppressive activity. We also found that FoxO3a occupy IL-6 gene promoter and repressed IL mRNA transcription. Further results showed that decreased expression of IL-6 in CSTP1-overexpressing cells inactivated Stat3 transcriptional factor, which resulted in the down-regulation of cyclin D1, Bcl-xl expression. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the mRNA level of CSTP1 correlated inversely with that of IL-6 in bladder cancer tissues. In conclusion, our studies revealed that protein phosphotase CSTP1 inhibited IL-6 expression through targeting Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway and IL-6 inactivated Stat3 was necessary for CSTP1's tumor suppressive function.

Abstract: Protein kinase RNA-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) is an endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor that possesses pro-survival capability and contributes to cell homeostasis and survival. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) has been recognized as a stem cell marker in intestinal epithelial cells. To determine whether PERK modulates the proliferation of intestinal stem cells, we investigated the effects of PERK knock-down on intestinal Lgr5-positive stem cells in mice. Lgr5-EGFP knock-in mice were fed with lentivirus-PERK shRNA twice a day for three days. Isolated intestinal Lgr5-positive stem cells were treated with lentivirus-PERK shRNA. The number of Lgr5-positive cells, the proliferation and apoptotic indices, several biomarkers for proliferation and differentiation, and Akt expression in intestinal stem cells were detected in vivo, in vitro and in two intestinal epithelial injury models caused by radiotherapy and sepsis. PERK knock-down could significantly diminish the number and proliferation of Lgr5-positive cells, induce the low expression of several proliferation markers and the high expression of several differentiation markers in Lgr5-positive cells, enhance the apoptotic Lgr5-positive cells, and reduce the Akt expression in intestinal Lgr5-positive stem cells. Similar results were observed in radiotherapy- and sepsis-induced intestinal injuries. Moreover, PERK inhibition markedly decreased the survival of mice in response to radiation and sepsis. These results suggest a critical role for PERK in the proliferation and survival of intestinal stem cells in mice.

Abstract: Summary
Although pluripotent stem cells can generate various types of differentiated cells, it is unclear why lineage-committed stem/progenitor cells derived from pluripotent stem cells are decelerated and why the differentiation-resistant propensity of embryonic stem cell (ESC)/induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells is predominant compared with the in vivo equivalents derived from embryonic/adult tissues. In this study, we demonstrated that iPSCs reprogrammed and maintained with three chemical inhibitors of the fibroblast growth factor 4-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and GSK3β (3i) could be differentiated into all three germ layers more efficiently than the iPSCs reprogrammed without the 3i chemicals, even though they were maintained with 3i chemicals once they were reprogrammed. Although the iPSCs reprogrammed with 3i had increased numbers of Zscan4-positive cells, the Zscan4-positive cells among iPSCs that were reprogrammed without 3i did not have an accelerated differentiation ability. These observations suggest that 3i exposure during the reprogramming period determines the accelerated differentiation/maturation potentials of iPSCs that are stably maintained at the distinct state.

Abstract: COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (CSN5) has been involved in the progression of diverse human cancers. MMP2 plays an important role in the metastasis of cancer cells. However, the roles and relationship of in pancreatic cancer (PC) is still unknown. Here, our data shown that both CSN5 and MMP2 were significantly upregulated in PC compared with the corresponding adjacent tissues, where a positive correlation in their expression and associated malignant characteristics were found. Further, silencing of CSN5 expression markedly inhibited PC invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by decreased MMP2 expression. Moreover, the anti-metastasis role of CSN5 silence was reversed by MMP2 overexpression, whereas knockdown of MMP2 decreased PC metastasis driven by upregulation of CSN5. Further investigation revealed that CSN5 regulated MMP2 expression via activation of FOXM1 in PC cells. Mechanistically, CSN5 directly bound FOXM1 and decreased its ubiquitination to enhance the protein stability of FOXM1. Taken together, the results indicate that CSN5 can contribute to PC invasion and metastasis through activation of FOXM1/MMP2 axis.

Abstract: Activin A, a multifunctional cytokine of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, can be produced by the diverse immune cells. NK cells in peripheral blood are one of the major immune cells applied to cancer therapy in recent years. However, whether activin A can be produced by natural killer (NK) cells and be involved in regulation of peripheral blood NK cells activities of mouse are not well characterized. Here, we found that activin type IIA and IIB receptors and signaling molecules Smad2, 3 were expressed in peripheral blood NK cells of mouse by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. The cultured blood NK cells of mouse not only produced activin βA chain protein by intracellular cytokine staining, but also secreted mature activin A protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the production was promoted by IL-2. In addition, IL-2 as a positive control obviously promoted IFNγ production of mouse blood NK cells in vitro. However, activin A suppressed IFNγ production, but enhanced IL-2 synthesis and did not alter IL-10 production. Moreover, we found that activin A significantly suppressed the ability of NK cells to lyse target cells. These data revealed that blood NK cells of mouse were not only the target cells in response to activin A, but also the source of activin A, suggesting that activin A may play an important role in regulation of NK cells activities of mouse in an autocrine / paracrine manner.

Abstract: Oxidative stress plays an important role in the progression of cardiac diseases, including acute myocardial infarction, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and heart failure. Growing evidence indicates that thyroid hormone has protective properties against cardiovascular diseases. However, little is known about its effect on oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes or the underlying mechanisms. This study showed that T3 pretreatment in vivo significantly reduced cardiac dysfunction by increasing the left ventricular ejection function and ameliorating the pathological changes induced by I/R-induced injury. In an in vitro experiment, T3 inhibited apoptosis in H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by the decreased expression of Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and 9, and increased expression of Bcl-2. In addition, oxidative stress observed in hearts of mice with I/R injury was significantly alleviated by T3 pretreatment, intracellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS overproduction were effectively inhibited, and similar results were also detected in H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes in vitro. T3 significantly increased antioxidant protein (Nrf2 and HO-1) expression levels, and inhibited NOX2 and NOX4 protein expression levels in H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, T3 preserved mitochondrial functions upon H2O2-induced oxidative stress by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and promoting the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes. Notably, the PI3K/AKT signaling was significantly activated by T3 pretreatment in H2O2-induced cardiomyocytes. Together, these findings revealed that T3 could be served as potential therapeutic target for protection against cardiac oxidative stress injury through its antioxidant and anti-apoptosis effects, which are mediated by the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Recent and ongoing outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) underscore the unpredictable nature of ebolavirus reemergence and the urgent need for antiviral treatments. Unfortunately, available experimental vaccines and immunotherapeutics are specific for a single member of the Ebolavirus genus, Ebola virus (EBOV), and ineffective against other ebolaviruses associated with EVD, including Sudan virus (SUDV) and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV). Here we show that MBP134AF, a pan-ebolavirus therapeutic comprising two broadly neutralizing human antibodies (bNAbs), affords unprecedented effectiveness and potency as a therapeutic countermeasure to antigenically diverse ebolaviruses. MBP134AF could fully protect ferrets against lethal EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV infection, and a single 25-mg/kg dose was sufficient to protect NHPs against all three viruses. The development of MBP134AF provides a successful model for the rapid discovery and translational advancement of immunotherapeutics targeting emerging infectious diseases.

Abstract: Relapse of minimal residual disease (MRD) is a major problem after conventional chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The bone marrow stroma can protect AML cells from insults of chemotherapy, partly contributing to AML relapse. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is the main component of arsenical traditional Chinese medicines and has been widely used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia over the past three decades. ATO acts through a direct arsenic binding to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), thus killing the leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Our prior study has demonstrated that adhesion to stroma cells could render AML cells resistant to ATO but the detailed mechanism remains to be explored. Here, we report that the adhesion-induced resistance to ATO is related to the up-regulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Homoharringtonine (HHT) can potentiate the anti-leukemia effects of ATO on adhered AML cells by suppressing Mcl-1 through glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). Furthermore, a potentiating effect of HHT on ATO was also observed in primary AML cells and AML xenografted tumors. Thus, these data indicate that HHT could enhance ATO anti-leukemia activity both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is the most prevalent of cardiovascular diseases and pharmacological interventions do not lead to restoration of the lost cardiomyocytes. Despite extensive stem cell therapy studies, clinical trials using cardiac progenitor cells have shown moderate results. Furthermore, differentiation of endogenous progenitors to mature cardiomyocytes is rarely reported. A metabolic switch from glucose to fatty acid oxidation occurs during cardiac development and cardiomyocyte maturation, however in vitro differentiation protocols do not consider the lack of fatty acids in cell culture media. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of this metabolic switch on control and differentiated adult cardiac progenitors, by fatty acid supplementation. Addition of oleic acid stimulated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha pathway and led to maturation of the cardiac progenitors, both before and after transforming growth factor-beta 1 differentiation. Addition of oleic acid following differentiation increased expression of myosin heavy chain 7 and connexin 43. Also, total glycolytic metabolism increased, as did mitochondrial membrane potential and glucose and fatty acid transporter expression. This work provides new insights into the importance of fatty acids, and of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, in cardiac progenitor differentiation. Harnessing the oxidative metabolic switch induced maturation of differentiated endogenous stem cells. (200 words)

Abstract: Summary
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important mediator of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis via its receptor VEGFR2. A common tumor associated with elevated VEGFR2 signaling is infantile hemangioma that is caused by a rapid proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. The current first-line treatment for infantile hemangioma is the β-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, although its mechanism of action is not understood. Here we have used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and VEGFR2 genetically tagged with NanoLuc luciferase to demonstrate that oligomeric complexes involving VEGFR2 and the β2-adrenoceptor can be generated in both cell membranes and intracellular endosomes. These complexes are induced by agonist treatment and retain their ability to couple to intracellular signaling proteins. Furthermore, coupling of β2-adrenoceptor to β-arrestin2 is prolonged by VEGFR2 activation. These data suggest that protein-protein interactions between VEGFR2, the β2-adrenoceptor, and β-arrestin2 may provide insight into their roles in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed an Escherichia coli strain for the in vivo production of O-glycosylated proteins. This was achieved using a dual plasmid approach: one encoding a therapeutic protein target, and a second encoding the enzymatic machinery required for O-glycosylation. The latter plasmid encodes human polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase as well as a β1,3-galactosyl transferase and UDP-Glc(NAc)-4-epimerase, both from Campylobacter jejuni, and a disulfide bond isomerase of bacterial or human origin. The effectiveness of this two-plasmid synthetic operon system has been tested on three proteins with therapeutic potential: the native and an engineered version of the naturally O-glycosylated human interferon α-2b, as well as human growth hormone with one engineered site of glycosylation. Having established proof of principle for the addition of the core-1 glycan onto proteins, we are now developing this system as a platform for producing and modifying human protein therapeutics with more complex O-glycan structures in E. coli.

Abstract: Summary
Non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) are biosynthesized on non-ribosomal peptides synthetase (NRPS) complexes, of which a C-terminal releasing domain commonly offloads the products. Interestingly, a dedicated releasing domain is absent in surugamides (SGM) NRPS, which directs the biosynthesis of cyclic octapeptides, SGM-A to -E, and the linear decapeptide, SGM-F. Here, we confirmed that surE is essential for the production of SGMs via genetic experiments. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme, SurE, can generate the main products SGM-A and -F from the corresponding SNAC substrates, indicating that SurE is a standalone thioesterase-like enzyme. SurE also displays considerable substrate plasticity with expanded ring or different amino acid compositions to produce different cyclopeptides, highlighting the potential of chemoenzymatic applications. Site-directed mutagenesis allowed identification of the key residues of SurE. Finally, bioinformatics analysis suggested that SurE homologs are widely distributed in bacteria, suggesting a general mechanism of NRP release in Nature.

Abstract: Astrocyte activation is crucial for wound contraction and glial scar formation following central nervous system injury, but the mechanism by which activation leads to astrocyte contractility and matrix reorganization in the central nervous system (CNS) is unknown. Current means to measure cell traction forces within three-dimensional scaffolds are limited to analyzing individual or small groups of cells, within extracellular matrices, whereas gap junctions and other cell-cell adhesions connect astrocytes to form a functional syncytium within the glial scar. Here, we measure the viscoelastic properties of cell-seeded hydrogels to yield insight into the collective contractility of astrocytes as they exert tension on the surrounding matrix and change its bulk mechanical properties. Our results indicate that incorporation of the CNS matrix component hyaluronan into a collagen hydrogel increases expression of the intermediate filament protein GFAP and results in a higher shear storage modulus of the cell/matrix composite, establishing the correlation between astrocyte activation and increased cell contractility. The effects of thrombin and blebbistatin, known mediators of actomyosin-mediated contraction, verify that cell-matrix tension dictates the hydrogel mechanical properties. Viability assays indicate that increased cell traction exacerbates cell death at the center of the scaffold, and message level analysis reveals that cells in the hyaluronan-containing matrix have a ~ 3-fold increase in HIF-1α gene expression. Overall, these findings suggest that astrocyte activation not only increases cell traction, but may also contribute to hypoxia near sites of central nervous system injury.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) show considerable promise for regenerating injured hearts, and we therefore tested their capacity to stably engraft in a translationally relevant preclinical model, the infarcted pig heart. Transplantation of immature hESC-CMs resulted in substantial myocardial implants within the infarct scar that matured over time, formed vascular networks with the host, and evoked minimal cellular rejection. While arrhythmias were rare in infarcted pigs receiving vehicle alone, hESC-CM recipients experienced frequent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia before reverting back to normal sinus rhythm by 4 weeks post transplantation. Electroanatomical mapping and pacing studies implicated focal mechanisms, rather than macro-reentry, for these graft-related tachyarrhythmias as evidenced by an abnormal centrifugal pattern with earliest electrical activation in histologically confirmed graft tissue. These findings demonstrate the suitability of the pig model for the preclinical development of a hESC-based cardiac therapy and provide new insights into the mechanistic basis of electrical instability following hESC-CM transplantation.

Abstract: Carbonate alkalinity, salinity, and pH are three important stress factors for aquatic animals in saline–alkaline water. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) catalyze the reversible reaction of CO2 reported to play an important role in the acid–base regulation in vertebrates. To explore the molecular mechanism of CAs efficacy in shrimp after their transfer into saline–alkaline water, the cDNAs of three CAs (EcCAc, EcCAg, and EcCAb) were cloned from Exopalaemon carinicauda. Sequence analysis showed that EcCAc and EcCAg both possessed a conserved α-CA domain and a proton acceptor site, and EcCAb contained a Pro-CA domain. Tissue expression analysis demonstrated that EcCAc and EcCAg were most abundantly in gills, and EcCAb was highly expressed in muscle. The cumulative mortalities remained below 25% under exposure to pH (pH 6 and pH 9), low salinity (5 ppt), or high carbonate alkalinity (5 and 10 mmol/L) after 72 h of exposure. However, mortalities increased up to 70% under extreme saline–alkaline stress (salinity 5 ppt, carbonate alkalinity 10 mmol/L, and pH 9) after 14 days of exposure. The EcCAc and EcCAg expressions in gills were significantly upregulated during the early period of pH and saline–alkaline stresses, while the EcCAb expressions showed no regular or large changes. The two-way ANOVA found significant interactions between salinity and carbonate alkalinity observed in EcCAc, EcCAg, and EcCAb expressions (p < 0.05). Furthermore, an RNA interference experiment resulted in increased mortality of EcCAc- and EcCAg-silenced prawns under saline–alkaline stress. EcCAc knockdown reduced expressions of Na+/H+ exchanger (EcNHE) and sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (EcNBC), and EcCAg knockdown reduced EcCAc, EcNHE, EcNBC, and V-type H+-ATPase (EcVTP) expressions. These results suggest EcCAc and EcCAg as important modulators in response to pH and saline–alkaline stresses in E. carinicauda.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the degeneration of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons (vmDAns) and the accumulation of toxic α-synuclein. A non-cell-autonomous contribution, in particular of astrocytes, during PD pathogenesis has been suggested by observational studies, but remains to be experimentally tested. Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes and neurons from familial mutant LRRK2 G2019S PD patients and healthy individuals. Upon co-culture on top of PD astrocytes, control vmDAns displayed morphological signs of neurodegeneration and abnormal, astrocyte-derived α-synuclein accumulation. Conversely, control astrocytes partially prevented the appearance of disease-related phenotypes in PD vmDAns. We additionally identified dysfunctional chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), impaired macroautophagy, and progressive α-synuclein accumulation in PD astrocytes. Finally, chemical enhancement of CMA protected PD astrocytes and vmDAns via the clearance of α-synuclein accumulation. Our findings unveil a crucial non-cell-autonomous contribution of astrocytes during PD pathogenesis, and open the path to exploring novel therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the pathogenic cross talk between neurons and glial cells.

Abstract: Despite few studies on intracellular heat shock protein70, the clinical association between insulin resistance and extracellular heat shock protein70 (eHSP70) is not well studied. In the current study, we examined the association between homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and eHSP70 in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and healthy controls. A total of 145 patients with T2DM and 41 matched healthy controls were selected. Patients and controls were divided based on waist circumference (WC) to two groups, and eHSP70 was compared between them. The association between HOMA-IR and eHSP70 was examined using regression models adjusted for age, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and central obesity as confounding factors. While eHSP70 and hs-CRP were significantly correlated with HOMA-IR in patients with T2DM (p = 0.032, 0.025, respectively), there was no correlation between eHSP70 and HOMA-IR in the control group. Extracellular HSP70 and hs-CRP were not correlated in healthy controls. But a significant association appeared between eHSP70 and hs-CRP in patients with T2DM (p = 0.05). Both BMI and WC were not correlated with eHSP70 in both groups. Extracellular HSP70 was positively associated with HOMA-IR in patients with T2DM, independent from hs-CRP and obesity. We also showed eHSP70 levels remained unchanged through increase in BMI or WC in patients with T2D and in healthy controls. Our findings suggest that eHSP70 may contribute to the pathogenesis of T2DM by increasing insulin resistance.

Abstract: Mutations in the HADHB gene induce dysfunctions in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and result in a MTP deficiency, which is characterized by clinical heterogeneity, such as cardiomyopathy and recurrent Leigh-like encephalopathy. In contrast, milder forms of HADHB mutations cause the later onset of progressive axonal peripheral neuropathy (approximately 50–80%) and myopathy with or without episodic myoglobinuria. The mechanisms linking neuronal defects in these diseases to the loss of HADHB function currently remain unclear. Drosophila has the CG4581 (dHADHB) gene as a single human HADHB homologue. We herein established pan-neuron-specific dHADHB knockdown flies and examined their phenotypes. The knockdown of dHADHB shortened the lifespan of flies, reduced locomotor ability and also limited learning abilities. These phenotypes were accompanied by an abnormal synapse morphology at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and reduction in both ATP and ROS levels in central nervous system (CNS). The Drosophila NMJ synapses are glutamatergic that is similar to those in the vertebrate CNS. The present results reveal a critical role for dHADHB in the morphogenesis and function of glutamatergic neurons including peripheral neurons. The dHADHB knockdown flies established herein provide a useful model for investigating the pathological mechanisms underlying neuropathies caused by a HADHB deficiency.

Abstract: Here, we developed a novel in vitro co-culture model, in which process-bearing astrocytes and isolated cerebral microvessels from mice were co-cultured. Astrocytes formed contacts with microvessels from both adult and neonatal mice. However, concentrated localization of the immunofluorescence signal for aquaporin-4 (AQP4) at contact sites between perivascular endfoot processes and blood vessels was only detected with neonatal mouse microvessels. Contact between astrocytic processes and microvessels was retained, whereas concentrated localization of AQP4 signal at contact sites was lost, by knockdown of dystroglycan or α-syntrophin, reflecting polarized localization of AQP4 at perivascular regions in the brain. Further, using our in vitro co-culture model, we found that astrocytes predominantly extend processes to pericytes located at the abluminal surface of microvessels, providing additional evidence that this model is representative of the in vivo situation. Altogether, we have developed a novel in vitro co-culture model that can reproduce aspects of the in vivo situation and is useful for assessing contact formation between astrocytes and blood vessels.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been identified as a primary factor involved in brain ischemia-reperfusion injury progression. p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) is a novel ER function regulator. The aim of our study is to explore the influence of Pak2 on ER stress and determine whether melatonin attenuates ER stress-mediated cell death by modulating Pak2 expression in vitro using N2a cells. The results of our study demonstrated that hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) injury repressed the levels of Pak2, an effect that was accompanied by activation of ER stress. In addition, decreased Pak2 was associated with oxidative stress, calcium overload, and caspase-12-mediated apoptosis activation in HR-treated N2a cells. Interestingly, melatonin treatment reversed the decreased Pak2 expression under HR stress. Knockdown of Pak2 abolished the protective effects of melatonin on ER stress, oxidative stress, and caspase-12-related N2a cells death. Additionally, we found that Pak2 was regulated by melatonin via the AMPK pathway; inhibition of AMPK prevented melatonin-mediated Pak2 upregulation, a result that was accompanied by an increase in N2a cell death. Altogether, these results identify the AMPK-Pak2 axis as a new signaling pathway responsible for ER stress and N2a cell viability under HR injury. Modulation of the AMPK-Pak2 cascade via supplementation of melatonin might be considered an effective approach to attenuate reperfusion-mediated N2a cell damage via repression of ER stress.

Abstract: Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, mediated by integrin receptors, is crucial for cell survival. Receptor-ligand interaction involves conformational changes in the integrin by a mechanism not fully elucidated. In addition to several direct evidence that there is disulfide re-arrangement of integrins, we previously demonstrated a role for extracellular thiols and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in integrin-mediated functions using platelets as model system. Exploring the possible generality of this mechanism, we now show, using three different nucleated cells which depend on adhesion for survival, that non-penetrating blockers of free thiols inhibit α2β1 and α5β1 integrin-mediated adhesion and that disulfide exchange takes place in that process. Inhibiting extracellular PDI mimics thiol blocking. Transfection with WT or enzymatically inactive PDI increased their membrane expression and enhanced cell adhesion, suggesting that PDI level is a limiting factor and that the chaperone activity of the enzyme contributes to adhesion. Exogenously added PDI also enhanced adhesion, further supporting the limiting factor of the enzyme. These data indicate that: a) Dependence on ecto-sulfhydryls for integrin-mediated adhesion is not exclusive to the platelet; b) PDI is involved in integrin-mediated adhesion, catalyzing disulfide bond exchange; c) PDI enhances cell adhesion by both its oxidoreductase activity and as a chaperone.

Abstract: Selenium (Se), an antioxidant agent, provides significant protection from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell damage in vivo and in vitro. However, it is unclear whether Se can protect against zearalenone (ZEN)-induced apoptosis in chicken spleen lymphocyte. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of the apoptosis induced by ZEN in chicken spleen lymphocyte and further evaluated the protective mechanism of Se on ZEN-induced apoptosis. The results show that ZEN induced an increase in ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, and a decrease in levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione (GSH). The results of apoptosis morphologically from acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) fluorescent staining and flow cytometry analysis show apparent apoptosis in the ZEN-treated group, and was confirmed by the upregulation of caspase-3, -12 and downregulation of Bcl-2. Meanwhile, ZEN activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by upregulating ER stress-related molecular sensors (GRP78, ATF6, ATF4, IRE). However, co-treatment with Se effectively blocked ROS generation, improved antioxdative capacity, and reversed apoptosis and ER stress-related genes and protein expression. Taken together, these data suggest that oxidative stress and ER stress play a vital role in ZEN-induced apoptosis, and Se had a significant preventive effect on ZEN-induced apoptosis in chicken spleen lymphocyte via ameliorating the ER stress signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Super-resolution microscopy requires that subcellular structures are labeled with bright and photostable fluorophores, especially for live-cell imaging. Organic fluorophores may help here as they can yield more photons—by orders of magnitude—than fluorescent proteins. To achieve molecular specificity with organic fluorophores in live cells, self-labeling proteins are often used, with HaloTags and SNAP-tags being the most common. However, how these two different tagging systems compare with each other is unclear, especially for stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, which is limited to a small repertoire of fluorophores in living cells. Herein, we compare the two labeling approaches in confocal and STED imaging using various proteins and two model systems. Strikingly, we find that the fluorescent signal can be up to 9-fold higher with HaloTags than with SNAP-tags when using far-red rhodamine derivatives. This result demonstrates that the labeling strategy matters and can greatly influence the duration of super-resolution imaging.

Abstract: Summary
Recent estimates of the human proteome suggest there are ∼20,000 protein-coding genes, the protein products of which contain >145,000 phosphosites. Unfortunately, in-depth examination of the human phosphoproteome has outpaced the ability to annotate the kinases that mediate these post-translational modifications. To obtain actionable information about phosphorylation-driven signaling cascades, it is essential to identify the kinases responsible for phosphorylating sites that differ across disease states. To fill in these gaps we have developed an unbiased, chemoproteomic approach for identifying high-confidence kinase-substrate interactions with phosphosite specificity. Using this assay, we uncovered the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), a clinically validated kinase important for cell-cycle progression, in regulating cap-dependent translation via phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor 4E-BP1. The discovery of this signaling axis sheds light on the mechanisms by which CDK4/6 inhibitors control cell proliferation and constitutes a successful example of kinase discovery using an activity-based, kinase-directed probe.

Abstract: Metastasis remains the primary cause of cancer mortality. Throughout the process of metastasis, cancer cells experience mechanical forces, which may turn out to be the key towards their migratory, homeostatic and survival characteristics. However, the influence of compressive stress on the underlying mechanism of cancer cell adaptation during metastasis has remained grossly unexplored. In this study, we have investigated whether compressive force induces autophagy in HeLa cells with potential implications in cellular invasiveness. To this end, we have adopted a simple strategy to create the mechanically-compressed tumor microenvironment, in vitro, by applying appropriate compression to agarose-scaffolded HeLa cell-encapsulated alginate beads. Our findings confirm that compression upregulates autophagy, which promotes paxillin turnover and active MMP-2 secretion, leading to enhanced migration of HeLa cells. We further show that autophagy induction by compression is affected by the phosphorylation of p38 MAPKs, a process that is mediated by intact membrane lipid rafts. Identifying the role of such mechanically triggered cellular responses, guiding crucial processes like cell migration, may lead to better understanding of the mechanobiological aspects of metastatic cancer and unveil potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Exocrine pancreas insufficiency is common in diabetic mellitus (DM) patients. Cellular stress is a prerequisite in the development of pancreatic pathologies such as acute pancreatitis (AP). The molecular mechanisms underlying exocrine pancreatic ER-stress in DM are largely unknown. We studied the effects of insulin and glucose (related to DM) alone and in combination with cerulein (CER)-induced stress (mimicking AP) on ER-stress unfolded protein response (UPR) in pancreatic acinar cells. Exocrine pancreas cells (AR42J) were exposed to high glucose (Glu, 25 mM) and insulin (Ins, 100 nM) levels with or without CER (10 nM). ER-stress UPR activation was analyzed at the transcript, protein, immunocytochemistry, western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR and XBP1 splicing, including; XBP1, sXBP1, ATF6, cleaved ATF6, IRE1-p, CHOP, Caspase-12 and Bax. Exocrine acinar cells exposed to high Ins or Ins+Glu concentrations (but not Glu alone) exhibited ER-stress UPR, demonstrated by significant increase of transcript and protein levels of downstream markers in the ATF6 and IRE1 transduction arms, including: sXBP1, cleaved ATF6, XBP1, CHOP, IRE1-p and caspase-12. UPR activation resulted in IRE1-p aggregation and nuclear trans-localization of cleaved activated ATF6 and sXBP1. Ins further aggravated UPR when cells were co-challenged with CER-induced stress, exacerbating the effects of CER alone. High Ins levels, typical to type-2-DM, activate the ER-stress UPR in pancreatic acinar cells, through the ATF6 and IRE1 pathways. This effect of Ins in naïve acinar cells further augments CER-induced UPR. Our data highlight molecular pathways through which DM enhances exocrine pancreas pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors often bind several kinases due to the high conservation of the ATP binding pocket. Through clustering analysis of a large kinome profiling dataset, we found a cluster of eight promiscuous kinases that on average bind more than five times more kinase inhibitors than the other 398 kinases in the dataset. To understand the structural basis of promiscuous inhibitor binding, we determined the co-crystal structure of the receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 with the type I inhibitors dasatinib and VX-680. Surprisingly, we find that DDR1 binds these type I inhibitors in an inactive conformation typically reserved for type II inhibitors. Our computational and biochemical studies show that DDR1 is unusually stable in this inactive conformation, giving a mechanistic explanation for inhibitor promiscuity. This phenotypic clustering analysis provides a strategy to obtain functional insights not available by sequence comparison alone.

Abstract: Sec15, a component of an evolutionarily conserved octomeric exocyst complex, has been identified as an interactor of GTP-bound Rab11 in mammals and Drosophila which shows its role in secretion in yeast and intracellular vesicle transport. Here, we report the expression patterns of Drosophila Sec15 (DSec15) transcript and Sec15 protein during Drosophila development. At early embryonic stages, a profound level of maternally loaded DSec15 transcript and protein is found. At cellular blastoderm cells (stage 5 embryos); the expression is seen in pole cells, apical membrane and sub-apical region. The transcript is predominantly accumulated in mesoderm, tracheal pits, gut, LE cells, trachea, and ventral nerve cord as development proceeds. While, a robust expression of Sec15 is seen in amnioserosa (AS), lateral epidermis (LAE), developing trachea, gut, ventral nerve cord and epithelial cells. During larval development, the transcript is also found in all imaginal discs with a distinguished accumulation in the morphogenetic furrow of eye disc, gut, proventriculus and gastric ceacae, garland cells/nephrocytes, malpighian tubules, ovary and testis. Further, we show that Sec15 co-localizes with Rab11 during Drosophila embryonic and larval development. Finally, using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that Sec15 interacts with Rab11 in producing blister during Drosophila wing development.

Abstract: Summary
It is thought that corneal epithelial injuries resolve by leading-edge cells “sliding” or “rolling” into the wound bed. Here, we challenge this notion and show by real-time imaging that corneal wounds initially heal by “basal cell migration.” The K14CreERT2-Confetti multi-colored reporter mouse was employed to spatially and temporally fate-map cellular behavior during corneal wound healing. Keratin-14+ basal epithelia are forced into the wound bed by increased population pressure gradient from the limbus to the wound edge. As the defect resolves, centripetally migrating epithelia decelerate and replication in the periphery is reduced. With time, keratin-14+-derived clones diminish in number concomitant with their expansion, indicative that clonal evolution aligns with neutral drifting. These findings have important implications for the involvement of stem cells in acute tissue regeneration, in key sensory tissues such as the cornea.

CRISPR-Cas immunity relies on genetic memories, termed spacers, for sequence-specific recognition of infections. The diversity of spacers within host populations is important for immune resilience, but we have limited understanding of how CRISPR diversity is generated. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems use existing spacers to enhance the acquisition of new spacers through primed CRISPR adaptation (priming). Here, we present a pathway to priming that is stimulated by imprecisely acquired (slipped) spacers. Slipped spacers are less effective for immunity but increase priming compared with canonical spacers. The benefits of slipping depend on the relative rates of phage mutation and adaptation during defense. We propose that slipped spacers provide a route to increase population-level spacer diversity that pre-empts phage escape mutant proliferation and that the trade-off between adaptation and immunity is important in diverse CRISPR-Cas systems.

Abstract: Cell migration is part of many important in vivo biological processes and is influenced by chemical and physical factors such as substrate topography. Although the migratory behavior of different cell types on structured substrates has already been investigated, up to date it is largely unknown if specimen's age affects cell migration on structures. In this work, we investigated age-dependent migratory behavior of human endothelial cells from young (≤ 31 years old) and old (≥ 60 years old) donors on poly(dimethylsiloxane) microstructured substrates consisting of well-defined parallel grooves. We observed a decrease in cell migration velocity in all substrate conditions and in persistence length perpendicular to the grooves in cells from old donors. Nevertheless, in comparison to young cells, old cells exhibited a higher cell directionality along grooves of certain depths and a higher persistence time. We also found a systematic decrease of donor age-dependent responses of cell protrusions in orientation, velocity and length, all of them decreased in old cells. These observations lead us to hypothesize a possible impairment of actin cytoskeleton network and affected actin polymerization and steering systems, caused by aging.

Abstract: The DNA polymerase δ catalytic subunit (PolD1) is a highly conserved protein with established functions in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm: whereas PolD1 participates in the replication and repair of nuclear DNA, it plays a role in the control of cytoplasmic microtubule growth by directly acting on microtubule-nucleator γ-tubulin ring complexes. Here, we show that PolD1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. PolD1 harbors two nuclear localization signals that mediate the active transport of PolD1 to the nucleus; conversely, PolD1 is exported from the nucleus by the exportin CRM1-dependent mechanism, a major nuclear-export pathway that mediates the export of various cargos. These findings suggest that the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of PolD1 is influenced by both the nuclear import and export activities of the protein.
