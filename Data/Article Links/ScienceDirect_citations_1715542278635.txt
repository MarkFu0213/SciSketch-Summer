Abstract: Summary
Optogenetic tools and imaging methods for recording and manipulating brain activity have boosted the field of neuroscience in unprecedented ways. However, behavioral paradigms for mice lag behind those of primates, limiting the full potential of such tools. Here, we present an innovative behavioral framework in which head-fixed mice directionally reach for water droplets, similar to the primate “center-out” reaching task. Mice rapidly engaged in the task, performed hundreds of trials, and reached in multiple directions when droplets were presented at different locations. Surprisingly, mice used chemosensation to determine the presence of water droplets. Optogenetic inactivation of the motor cortex halted the initiation and rapidly diverted the trajectory of ongoing movements. Layer 2/3 two-photon imaging revealed robust direction selectivity in most reach-related neurons. Finally, mice performed directional reaching instructed by vibratotactile stimuli, demonstrating the potential of this framework for studying, in addition to motor control, sensory processing, and decision making.

Abstract: Bone resorption is mainly mediated by osteoclasts (OCs), whose formation and function are regulated by intracellular Ca2+ oscillation. Our previous studies demonstrated that fluid shear stress (FSS) lead to Ca2+ oscillation through mechanosensitive cation-selective channels. However, the specific channels responsible for this FSS-induced Ca2+ oscillation remain unknown. In the present study, we examined the expression of several Ca2+ channels in OCs, including STIM1, ORAI1, TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPV5, and TRPV6, by western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that STIM1 was highly expressed in early stage OCs, while TRPV4 was highly expressed in late stage OCs. We observed intracellular Ca2+ responses in OCs that were mechanically stimulated by FSS. When we blocked STIM1-dependent store-operated Ca2+ entry or inhibited TRPV4 using siRNA or drug inhibition, FSS-induced Ca2+ oscillations were almost undetectable in early and late stage OCs, respectively. These results indicate that STIM1 and TRPV4 act as mechanical transduction channels for OCs during the early and late differentiation stages, respectively, suggesting that these calcium channel could serve as markers of osteoclastogenesis or bone resorption.

Abstract: Summary
Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovar (S.) Typhi differs in its clinical presentation from gastroenteritis caused by S. Typhimurium and other non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars. The different clinical presentations are attributed in part to the virulence-associated capsular polysaccharide (Vi antigen) of S. Typhi, which prevents phagocytes from triggering a respiratory burst by preventing antibody-mediated complement activation. Paradoxically, the Vi antigen is absent from S. Paratyphi A, which causes a disease that is indistinguishable from typhoid fever. Here, we show that evasion of the phagocyte respiratory burst by S. Paratyphi A required very long O antigen chains containing the O2 antigen to inhibit antibody binding. We conclude that the ability to avoid the phagocyte respiratory burst is a property distinguishing typhoidal from non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars that was acquired by S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A independently through convergent evolution.

Abstract: Summary
The antidiabetic potential of glucagon receptor antagonism presents an opportunity for use in an insulin-centric clinical environment. To investigate the metabolic effects of glucagon receptor antagonism in type 2 diabetes, we treated Leprdb/db and Lepob/ob mice with REMD 2.59, a human monoclonal antibody and competitive antagonist of the glucagon receptor. As expected, REMD 2.59 suppresses hepatic glucose production and improves glycemia. Surprisingly, it also enhances insulin action in both liver and skeletal muscle, coinciding with an increase in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated lipid oxidation. Furthermore, weekly REMD 2.59 treatment over a period of months protects against diabetic cardiomyopathy. These functional improvements are not derived simply from correcting the systemic milieu; nondiabetic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of lipoprotein lipase also show improvements in contractile function after REMD 2.59 treatment. These observations suggest that hyperglucagonemia enables lipotoxic conditions, allowing the development of insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction during disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Assays that can characterize MSC immune potency need to be identified for use in advanced clinical trials. MSCs possess a number of putative regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, and an assay matrix approach may best capture involved effector pathways. We have tested two assay systems to measure the potency of MSCs derived from human subjects: MSC secretome analysis and a quantitative RNA-based array for genes specific to immunomodulatory and homing properties of MSCs. Secretome analysis identified a unique cytokine signature that is upregulated by MSCs or downregulated in responder PBMCs and correlated with T cell suppression. Use of interferon-γ as a surrogate for the action of activated PBMCs on MSCs served as an alternative for the use of human PBMCs as responder cells in a potency assay. Our approach and results define and simplify the multifunctional or matrix responses of MSCs and may serve as a platform for robust potency analysis.

Abstract: Hypoxic culture is widely recognized as a method to efficiently expand human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) without loss of stem cell properties. However, the molecular basis of how hypoxia priming benefits MSC expansion remains unclear. In this report, our systemic quantitative proteomic and RT-PCR analyses revealed the involvement of hypoxic conditioning activated genes in the signaling process of the mitotic cell cycle. Introduction of screened two mitotic cyclins, CCNA2 and CCNB1, significantly extended the proliferation lifespan of MSCs in normoxic condition. Our results provide important molecular evidence that multipotency of human MSCs by hypoxic conditioning is determined by the mitotic cell cycle duration. Thus, the activation of mitotic cyclins could be a potential strategy to the application of stem cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The yeast INO80 chromatin remodeling complex plays essential roles in regulating DNA damage repair, replication, and promoter architecture. INO80’s role in these processes is likely related to its ability to slide nucleosomes, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we use ensemble and single-molecule enzymology to study INO80-catalyzed nucleosome sliding. We find that the rate of nucleosome sliding by INO80 increases ∼100-fold when the flanking DNA length is increased from 40 to 60 bp. Furthermore, once sliding is initiated, INO80 moves the nucleosome rapidly at least 20 bp without pausing to re-assess flanking DNA length, and it can change the direction of nucleosome sliding without dissociation. Finally, we show that the Nhp10 module of INO80 plays an auto-inhibitory role, tuning INO80’s switch-like response to flanking DNA. Our results indicate that INO80 is a highly processive remodeling motor that is tightly regulated by both substrate cues and non-catalytic subunits.

Abstract: Summary
Under stress, certain eukaryotic proteins and RNA assemble to form membraneless organelles known as stress granules. The most well-studied stress granule components are RNA-binding proteins that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) into protein-rich droplets mediated by intrinsically disordered low-complexity domains (LCDs). Here we show that stress granules include proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN2, an LCD-containing protein structurally and functionally distinct from RNA-binding proteins. In vitro, UBQLN2 exhibits LLPS at physiological conditions. Deletion studies correlate oligomerization with UBQLN2’s ability to phase-separate and form stress-induced cytoplasmic puncta in cells. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we mapped weak, multivalent interactions that promote UBQLN2 oligomerization and LLPS. Ubiquitin or polyubiquitin binding, obligatory for UBQLN2’s biological functions, eliminates UBQLN2 LLPS, thus serving as a switch between droplet and disperse phases. We postulate that UBQLN2 LLPS enables its recruitment to stress granules, where its interactions with ubiquitinated substrates reverse LLPS to enable shuttling of clients out of stress granules.

Abstract: All three members of the Orai family of cation channels–Orai1, Orai2 and Orai3–are integral membrane proteins that can form store-operated Ca2+ channels resembling endogenous calcium release-activated channels (CRAC) in many aspects. Loss of function studies in human and murine models revealed many functions of Orai1 proteins not only for Ca2+ homeostasis, but also for cellular and systemic functions in many cell types. By contrast, the knowledge regarding the contribution of Orai2 and Orai3 proteins in these processes is sparse. In this study, we report the generation of mouse models with targeted inactivation of the Orai2 gene to study Orai2 function in peritoneal mast cells (PMC), a classical cell model for CRAC channels and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of inflammatory mediators. We show that the Ca2+ rise triggered by agonists acting on high-affinity Fc receptors for IgE or on MAS-related G protein-coupled receptors is significantly increased in Orai2-deficient mast cells. Ca2+ entry triggered by depletion of intracellular stores (SOCE) is also increased in Orai2−/− PMCs at high (2mM) extracellular Ca2+ concentration, whereas SOCE is largely reduced upon re-addtion of lower (0.1mM) Ca2+ concentration. Likewise, the density of CRAC currents, Ca2+-dependent mast cell degranulation, and mast cell-mediated anaphylaxis are intensified in Orai2-deficient mice. These results show that the presence of Orai2 proteins limits receptor-evoked Ca2+ transients, store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) as well as degranulation of murine peritoneal mast cells but also raise the idea that Orai2 proteins contribute to Ca2+ entry in connective tissue type mast cells in discrete operation modes depending on the availability of calcium ions in the extracellular space.

Abstract: Summary
Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are important regulators of ubiquitin signaling. Here, we report the discovery of deubiquitinating activity in ZUFSP/C6orf113. High-resolution crystal structures of ZUFSP in complex with ubiquitin reveal several distinctive features of ubiquitin recognition and catalysis. Our analyses reveal that ZUFSP is a novel DUB with no homology to any known DUBs, leading us to classify ZUFSP as the seventh DUB family. Intriguingly, the minimal catalytic domain does not cleave polyubiquitin. We identify two ubiquitin binding domains in ZUFSP: a ZHA (ZUFSP helical arm) that binds to the distal ubiquitin and an atypical UBZ domain in ZUFSP that binds to polyubiquitin. Importantly, both domains are essential for ZUFSP to selectively cleave K63-linked polyubiquitin. We show that ZUFSP localizes to DNA lesions, where it plays an important role in genome stability pathways, functioning to prevent spontaneous DNA damage and also promote cellular survival in response to exogenous DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolism is a fundamental process of life. However, non-invasive measurement of local tissue metabolism is limited today by a deficiency in adequate tools for in vivo observations. We designed a multi-modular platform that explored the relation between local tissue oxygen consumption, determined by label-free optoacoustic measurements of hemoglobin, and concurrent indirect calorimetry obtained during metabolic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). By studying mice and humans, we show how video-rate handheld multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) in the 700–970 nm spectral range enables non-invasive imaging of BAT activation, consistent with positron emission tomography findings. Moreover, we observe BAT composition differences between healthy and diabetic tissues. The study consolidates hemoglobin as a principal label-free biomarker for longitudinal non-invasive imaging of BAT morphology and bioenergetics in situ. We also resolve water and fat components in volunteers, and contrast MSOT readouts with magnetic resonance imaging data.

Abstract: Summary
A major obstacle for successful management of patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is resistance to anti-cancer cytotoxic treatments. Here, we identified a mechanism of multidrug resistance in wild-type Kras CRCs based on the survival of a cell subpopulation characterized by Sirt5 expression. Sirt5+ cells in wild-type Kras CRCs are resistant to either chemotherapeutic agents or cetuximab and serve as a reservoir for recurrence. Sirt5 demalonylates and inactivates succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA), leading to an accumulation of the oncometabolite succinate. Succinate binds to and activates a reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme, thioredoxin reductase 2 (TrxR2), to confer chemotherapy resistance. In contrast, Sirt5+ cells exhibit an elevated succinate-to-aKG ratio that inhibits aKG-dependent dioxygenases to maintain cetuximab resistance. Our findings suggest that Sirt5 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and/or cetuximab may represent a therapeutic strategy for CRC patients harboring wild-type Kras.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative mRNA processing is a critical mechanism for proteome expansion and gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. The SR family proteins play important roles in splicing regulation. Intriguingly, mammalian genomes encode many poorly characterized SR-like proteins, including subunits of the mRNA 3′-processing factor CFIm, CFIm68 and CFIm59. Here we demonstrate that CFIm functions as an enhancer-dependent activator of mRNA 3′ processing. CFIm regulates global alternative polyadenylation (APA) by specifically binding and activating enhancer-containing poly(A) sites (PASs). Importantly, the CFIm activator functions are mediated by the arginine-serine repeat (RS) domains of CFIm68/59, which bind specifically to an RS-like region in the CPSF subunit Fip1, and this interaction is inhibited by CFIm68/59 hyper-phosphorylation. The remarkable functional similarities between CFIm and SR proteins suggest that interactions between RS-like domains in regulatory and core factors may provide a common activation mechanism for mRNA 3′ processing, splicing, and potentially other steps in RNA metabolism.

Abstract: Here, we report isolation of multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expressed tissue-specifically during murine embryogenesis. One of these, subsequently came to be known as Redrum, is expressed in erythropoietic cells in fetal liver and adult bone marrow. Redrum transcription is also detected during pregnancy in the spleen where extramedullary hematopoiesis takes place. In order to examine the function of Redrum in vivo, we generated a gene-targeted murine model and analyzed its embryonic and adult erythropoiesis. The homozygous mutant embryo showed no apparent deficiency or defect in erythropoiesis. Adult erythropoiesis in bone marrow and in the spleen during pregnancy likewise showed no detectable phenotype as red blood cells matured in normal fashion. The phenotype is in contrast to the reported function of Redrum in vitro, and our observation implies that Redrum plays in vivo an accessory or supplementary role whose loss is compatible with normal erythropoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
The role of astrocytes in neurovascular coupling (NVC) is unclear. Here, we applied a multimodality imaging approach to concomitantly measure synchronized neuronal or astrocytic Ca2+ and hemodynamic changes in the mouse somatosensory cortex at rest and during sensory electrical stimulation. Strikingly, we found that low-frequency stimulation (0.3–1 Hz), which consistently evokes fast neuronal Ca2+ transients (6.0 ± 2.7 ms latency) that always precede vascular responses, does not always elicit astrocytic Ca2+ transients (313 ± 65 ms latency). However, the magnitude of the hemodynamic response is increased when astrocytic transients occur, suggesting a facilitatory role of astrocytes in NVC. High-frequency stimulation (5–10 Hz) consistently evokes a large, delayed astrocytic Ca2+ accumulation (3.48 ± 0.09 s latency) that is temporarily associated with vasoconstriction, suggesting a role for astrocytes in resetting NVC. At rest, neuronal, but not astrocytic, Ca2+ fluctuations correlate with hemodynamic low-frequency oscillations. Taken together, these results support a role for astrocytes in modulating, but not triggering, NVC.

Abstract: Summary
Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive tumor derived from malignant transformation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. AITL is characterized by loss-of-function mutations in Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 (TET2) epigenetic tumor suppressor and a highly recurrent mutation (p.Gly17Val) in the RHOA small GTPase. Yet, the specific role of RHOA G17V in AITL remains unknown. Expression of Rhoa G17V in CD4+ T cells induces Tfh cell specification; increased proliferation associated with inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) upregulation and increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Moreover, RHOA G17V expression together with Tet2 loss resulted in development of AITL in mice. Importantly, Tet2−/− RHOA G17V tumor proliferation in vivo can be inhibited by ICOS/PI3K-specific blockade, supporting a driving role for ICOS signaling in Tfh cell transformation.

Abstract: Summary
TGF-β has been demonstrated to promote tumor metastasis, and the regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report the role of USP2a in promoting metastasis by facilitating TGF-β-triggered signaling. USP2a interacts with TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 upon TGF-β stimulation and removes K33-linked polyubiquitin chains from Lys502 of TGFBR1, promoting the recruitment of SMAD2/3. Simultaneously, TGFBR2 phosphorylates Ser207/Ser225 of USP2a, leading to the disassociation of SMAD2/3 from TGFBR1. The phosphorylation of USP2a and SMAD2 is positively correlated in human tumor biopsies, and USP2a is hyper-phosphorylated in lung adenocarcinomas with lymph node invasion. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of USP2a dampens TGF-β-triggered signaling and metastasis. Our findings have characterized an essential role of USP2a as a potential target for treatment of metastatic cancers.

Abstract: Summary
We report an unanticipated system of joint regulation by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), involving collaborative multi-site phosphorylation of a single substrate. In budding yeast, the protein Ste5 controls signaling through a G1 arrest pathway. Upon cell-cycle entry, CDK inhibits Ste5 via multiple phosphorylation sites, disrupting its membrane association. Using quantitative time-lapse microscopy, we examined Ste5 membrane recruitment dynamics at different cell-cycle stages. Surprisingly, in S phase, where Ste5 recruitment should be blocked, we observed an initial recruitment followed by a steep drop-off. This delayed inhibition revealed a requirement for both CDK activity and negative feedback from the pathway MAPK Fus3. Mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, and electrophoretic analyses suggest that the CDK and MAPK modify shared sites, which are most extensively phosphorylated when both kinases are active and able to bind their docking sites on Ste5. Such collaborative phosphorylation can broaden regulatory inputs and diversify output dynamics of signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS can bind numerous effector proteins, which activate different downstream signaling events. The best known are RAF, phosphatidylinositide (PI)-3′ kinase, and RalGDS families, but many additional direct and indirect effectors have been reported. We have assessed how these effectors contribute to several major phenotypes in a quantitative way, using an arrayed combinatorial siRNA screen in which we knocked down 41 KRAS effectors nodes in 92 cell lines. We show that every cell line has a unique combination of effector dependencies, but in spite of this heterogeneity, we were able to identify two major subtypes of KRAS mutant cancers of the lung, pancreas, and large intestine, which reflect different KRAS effector engagement and opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Microorganisms evolved adaptive responses to survive stressful challenges in ever-changing environments. Understanding the relationships between the physiological/metabolic adjustments allowing cellular stress adaptation and gene expression changes being used by organisms to achieve such adjustments may significantly impact our ability to understand and/or guide evolution. Here, we studied those relationships during adaptation to various stress challenges in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, focusing on heat stress responses. We combined dozens of independent experiments measuring whole-genome gene expression changes during stress responses with a simplified kinetic model of central metabolism. We identified alternative quantitative ranges for a set of physiological variables in the model (production of ATP, trehalose, NADH, etc.) that are specific for adaptation to either heat stress or desiccation/rehydration. Our approach is scalable to other adaptive responses and could assist in developing biotechnological applications to manipulate cells for medical, biotechnological, or synthetic biology purposes.

Abstract: Treatment of massive bone defects is one of the most difficult problems to solve in orthopedics. At present, there is no consensus on the best way to resolve these problems. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of a three-dimensional bioimplant over massive bone defects, and to analyse if it improves the speed and quality of integration in recipient bone compared to allograft treatment. Fifteen female lambs with massive bone defects, surgically created in their tibias, were randomly divided into three groups of five lambs each: Group I −treated with the bioimplant; Group 2 −treated with the bioimplant plus nucleated cells of autologous bone marrow; Group 3 −treated with a frozen allograft. Radiographs were taken post-treatment at weeks 1, 6, and 12. Animals were euthanized to obtain the studied bone segment for morphological analyses. Treatment: with bioimplants vs. bioimplant plus bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNCs) showed a notorious osteogenic effect, but with greater osteoid synthesis and cellularity in the latter. These results suggest that combined treatment with bioimplants and BMNCs have an additive effect on massive bone defects in lambs. These experimental results could be applied to repair damaged human bone.

Abstract: Summary
Layer V of the entorhinal cortex (EC) receives input from the hippocampus and originates main entorhinal outputs. The deep-sublayer Vb, immunopositive for the transcription factor Ctip2, is thought to be the main recipient of hippocampal projections, whereas the superficial-sublayer LVa, immunonegative for Ctip2, originates the main outputs of EC. This disrupts the proposed role of EC as mediating hippocampal-cortical interactions. With the use of specific (trans)synaptic tracing approaches, we report that, in medial entorhinal cortex, layer Vb neurons innervate neurons in layers Va, II, and III. A similar circuitry exists in the lateral entorhinal cortex. We conclude that EC-layer Vb neurons mediate two circuits in the hippocampus-memory system: (1) a hippocampal output circuit to telencephalic areas by projecting to layer Va and (2) a feedback projection, sending information back to the EC-hippocampal loop via neurons in layers II and III.

Abstract: Summary
As most of the mitochondrial proteome is encoded in the nucleus, mitochondrial functions critically depend on nuclear gene expression and bidirectional mito-nuclear communication. However, mitochondria-to-nucleus communication pathways in mammals are incompletely understood. Here, we identify G-Protein Pathway Suppressor 2 (GPS2) as a mediator of mitochondrial retrograde signaling and a transcriptional activator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. GPS2-regulated translocation from mitochondria to nucleus is essential for the transcriptional activation of a nuclear stress response to mitochondrial depolarization and for supporting basal mitochondrial biogenesis in differentiating adipocytes and brown adipose tissue (BAT) from mice. In the nucleus, GPS2 recruitment to target gene promoters regulates histone H3K9 demethylation and RNA POL2 activation through inhibition of Ubc13-mediated ubiquitination. These findings, together, reveal an additional layer of regulation of mitochondrial gene transcription, uncover a direct mitochondria-nuclear communication pathway, and indicate that GPS2 retrograde signaling is a key component of the mitochondrial stress response in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
The access-repair-restore model for the role of chromatin in DNA repair infers that chromatin is a mere obstacle to DNA repair. However, here we show that blocking chromatin assembly, via knockdown of the histone chaperones ASF1 or CAF-1 or a mutation that prevents ASF1A binding to histones, hinders Rad51 loading onto ssDNA during homologous recombination. This is a consequence of reduced recruitment of the Rad51 loader MMS22L-TONSL to ssDNA, resulting in persistent RPA foci, extensive DNA end resection, persistent activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway, and cell cycle arrest. In agreement, histones occupy ssDNA during DNA repair in yeast. We also uncovered DNA-PKcs-dependent DNA damage-induced ASF1A phosphorylation, which enhances chromatin assembly, promoting MMS22L-TONSL recruitment and, hence, Rad51 loading. We propose that transient assembly of newly synthesized histones onto ssDNA serves to recruit MMS22L-TONSL to efficiently form the Rad51 nucleofilament for strand invasion, suggesting an active role of chromatin assembly in homologous recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells internalize cargos specifically through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) or clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). EndophilinA2 was shown as preferentially implicated in CIE, although initially involved in CME. Here, we investigated the native interplay of endophilinA2 and dynamin2 during CME as compared to CIE. We developed an unbiased integrative approach based on genome engineering, robust tracking methodology, and advanced analytics. We statistically identified CME and CIE subpopulations corresponding to abortive, active, and static endocytic events. Depletion of dynamin2 strongly affected active CME and CIE events, whereas the absence of endophilinA2 impacted only CIE. Accordingly, we demonstrated that endophilinA2 is needed for dynamin2 recruitment during CIE, but not in CME. Despite these differences, endophilinA2 and dynamin2 acted at the latest stage of endocytosis within a similar stoichiometry in both mechanisms. Thus, we propose a conserved function of dynamin2 and endophilinA2 in vesicle scission, but a differential regulation of their recruitment during CME and CIE.

Abstract: Summary
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were detected in the peripheral blood and the joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, serum-induced arthritis (SIA), and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) using flow cytometry. Circulating ILC2s were significantly increased in RA patients compared with healthy controls and inversely correlated with disease activity. Induction of arthritis in mice led to a fast increase in ILC2 number. To elucidate the role of ILC2 in arthritis, loss- and gain-of-function mouse models for ILC2 were subjected to arthritis. Reduction of ILC2 numbers in RORαcre/GATA3fl/fl and Tie2cre/RORαfl/fl mice significantly exacerbated arthritis. Increasing ILC2 numbers in mice by IL-25/IL-33 mini-circles or IL-2/IL-2 antibody complex and the adoptive transfer of wild-type (WT) ILC2s significantly attenuated arthritis by affecting the initiation phase. In addition, adoptive transfer of IL-4/13-competent WT but not IL-4/13−/− ILC2s and decreased cytokine secretion by macrophages. These data show that ILC2s have immune-regulatory functions in arthritis.

Abstract: Tissue hypoxia is a condition that induces calcium influx into living cells. Calcium is a major player in maintaining cell signaling and homeostasis, and mediates the regulation of gene transcription and cell proliferation; however, acute and aggressive calcium influx induced by hypoxia eventually leads to programmed cell death. The blind mole rat, Spalax, is a wild-spread burrowing mammal adapted to hypoxic environments. A tyrosine -to- phenylalanine (F481 in Spalax corresponding to Y485 in human full-length receptor; Y460 in human mature form) substitution is found in the erythropoietin receptor of Spalax and other species, which was previously shown to be strongly involved in the calcium channels activation and subsequent calcium influx. The current work aimed to explore the dynamics of calcium transport across Spalax nonhematopoietic cells’ membrane compared to above ground rat and mouse, and the role of the erythropoietin receptor of Spalax in the regulation of calcium influx under hypoxia. We show here that Epo-induced calcium influx in HEK293 cells transfected with Spalax EpoR is significantly lower than that of mouse; in hypoxia this difference was even more pronounced. Western blots confirmed a significant increase of Erk phosphorylation after stimulation with erythropoietin under hypoxia in cells transfected with mouse full length erythropoietin receptor compared to Spalax. Native primary fibroblasts showed lower cytosolic calcium concentrations in Spalax cells when compared to those of rats under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Spalax EpoR appears to play an important role in preventing deleterious consequences of hypoxia and maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional type 1 DCs (cDC1s) excel at cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens partly because they express DNGR-1, a receptor that recognizes exposed actin filaments on dead cells. In vitro polymerized F-actin can be used as a synthetic ligand for DNGR-1. However, cellular F-actin is decorated with actin-binding proteins, which could affect DNGR-1 recognition. Here, we demonstrate that myosin II, an F-actin-associated motor protein, greatly potentiates the binding of DNGR-1 to F-actin. Latex beads coated with F-actin and myosin II are taken up by DNGR-1+ cDC1s, and antigen associated with those beads is efficiently cross-presented to CD8+ T cells. Myosin II-deficient necrotic cells are impaired in their ability to stimulate DNGR-1 or to serve as substrates for cDC1 cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells. These results provide insights into the nature of the DNGR-1 ligand and have implications for understanding immune responses to cell-associated antigens and for vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated calcium channels (Cavs) are major Ca2+ entry pathways in excitable cells. Their β subunits facilitate membrane trafficking of the channel’s ion-conducting α1 pore and modulate its gating properties. We report that one β subunit, β3, reduces Ca2+ release following stimulation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation. This effect requires the SH3-HOOK domain of Cavβ3, includes physical β3/IP3 receptor interaction, and prevails when agonist-induced IP3 formation is bypassed by photolysis of caged IP3. In agreement with β3 acting as a brake on Ca2+ release, fibroblast migration is enhanced in vitro, and in vivo, closure of skin wounds is accelerated in the absence of β3. To mediate specific physiological responses and to prevent Ca2+ toxicity, cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals must be tightly controlled. The described function of β3, unrelated to its function as a Cav subunit, adds to this tight control.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory information is encoded within the brain in distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity. Understanding how these patterns influence behavior requires a method to measure and to bidirectionally perturb with high spatial resolution the activity of the multiple neuronal cell types engaged in sensory processing. Here, we combined two-photon holography to stimulate neurons expressing blue light-sensitive opsins (ChR2 and GtACR2) with two-photon imaging of the red-shifted indicator jRCaMP1a in the mouse neocortex in vivo. We demonstrate efficient control of neural excitability across cell types and layers with holographic stimulation and improved spatial resolution by opsin somatic targeting. Moreover, we performed simultaneous two-photon imaging of jRCaMP1a and bidirectional two-photon manipulation of cellular activity with negligible effect of the imaging beam on opsin excitation. This all-optical approach represents a powerful tool to causally dissect how activity patterns in specified ensembles of neurons determine brain function and animal behavior.

Abstract: Summary
It has been suggested that the evolution of protein complexes is significantly influenced by stochastic, non-adaptive processes. Using ligand binding as a proxy of function, we show that the structure of ligand-binding sites significantly influences the evolution of protein complexes. We show that homomers with multi-chain binding sites (MBSs) evolve new functions slower than monomers or other homomers, and those binding cofactors and metals have more conserved quaternary structure than other homomers. Moreover, the ligands and ligand-binding pockets of homologous MBS homomers are more similar than monomers and other homomers. Our results suggest strong evolutionary selection for quaternary structure in cofactor-binding MBS homomers, whereas neutral processes are more important in complexes with single-chain binding sites. They also have pharmacological implications, suggesting that complexes with single-chain binding sites are better targets for selective drugs, whereas MBS homomers are good candidates for broad-spectrum antibiotic and multitarget drug design.

Abstract: Summary
How are closely related lineages, including liver, pancreas, and intestines, diversified from a common endodermal origin? Here, we apply principles learned from developmental biology to rapidly reconstitute liver progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Mapping the formation of multiple endodermal lineages revealed how alternate endodermal fates (e.g., pancreas and intestines) are restricted during liver commitment. Human liver fate was encoded by combinations of inductive and repressive extracellular signals at different doses. However, these signaling combinations were temporally re-interpreted: cellular competence to respond to retinoid, WNT, TGF-β, and other signals sharply changed within 24 hr. Consequently, temporally dynamic manipulation of extracellular signals was imperative to suppress the production of unwanted cell fates across six consecutive developmental junctures. This efficiently generated 94.1% ± 7.35% TBX3+HNF4A+ human liver bud progenitors and 81.5% ± 3.2% FAH+ hepatocyte-like cells by days 6 and 18 of hPSC differentiation, respectively; the latter improved short-term survival in the Fah−/−Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− mouse model of liver failure.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to target the Cas9 nuclease to DNA sequences via Watson-Crick base pairing with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) has provided a dynamic tool for genome editing and an essential component of adaptive immune systems in bacteria. After generating a double-stranded break (DSB), Cas9 remains stably bound to DNA. Here, we show persistent Cas9 binding blocks access to the DSB by repair enzymes, reducing genome editing efficiency. Cas9 can be dislodged by translocating RNA polymerases, but only if the polymerase approaches from one direction toward the Cas9-DSB complex. By exploiting these RNA-polymerase/Cas9 interactions, Cas9 can be conditionally converted into a multi-turnover nuclease, mediating increased mutagenesis frequencies in mammalian cells and enhancing bacterial immunity to bacteriophages. These consequences of a stable Cas9-DSB complex provide insights into the evolution of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences and a simple method of improving selection of highly active sgRNAs for genome editing.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are critical for cancer progression and chemoresistance. How lipid metabolism regulates CSCs and chemoresistance remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that JAK/STAT3 regulates lipid metabolism, which promotes breast CSCs (BCSCs) and cancer chemoresistance. Inhibiting JAK/STAT3 blocks BCSC self-renewal and expression of diverse lipid metabolic genes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B), which encodes the critical enzyme for fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO). Moreover, mammary-adipocyte-derived leptin upregulates STAT3-induced CPT1B expression and FAO activity in BCSCs. Human breast-cancer-derived data suggest that the STAT3-CPT1B-FAO pathway promotes cancer cell stemness and chemoresistance. Blocking FAO and/or leptin re-sensitizes them to chemotherapy and inhibits BCSCs in mouse breast tumors in vivo. We identify a critical pathway for BCSC maintenance and breast cancer chemoresistance.

Abstract: Summary
The locomotion of C. elegans is balanced by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions. However, the molecular mechanisms that maintain the balance of synaptic transmission remain enigmatic. Here, we investigated the function of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in triggering spontaneous release at cholinergic and GABAergic synapses. Recordings of the miniature excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) showed that UNC-2/CaV2 and EGL-19/CaV1 channels are the two major triggers for spontaneous release. Notably, however, Ca2+-independent spontaneous release was observed at GABAergic but not cholinergic synapses. Functional screening led to the identification of hypomorphic unc-64/Syntaxin-1A and snb-1/VAMP2 mutants in which mEPSCs are severely impaired, whereas mIPSCs remain unaltered, indicating differential regulation of these currents at cholinergic and GABAergic synapses. Moreover, Ca2+-independent spontaneous GABA release was nearly abolished in the hypomorphic unc-64 and snb-1 mutants, suggesting distinct mechanisms for Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent spontaneous release.

Abstract: Exposure to hypoxia causes structural changes in the endothelial cell (EC) monolayer that alter its permeability. There was a report earlier of impairment of nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelium. The intervention of NO in the altered cellular arrangements of actin cytoskeleton in endothelium for rectification of paracellular gaps in endothelium under hypoxia was observed. The present study demonstrates hypoxia inducing paracellular gaps in hypoxia-exposed blood capillaries in chick embryo extravascular model. Phalloidin staining confirmed significant polymerization of actin and unique cellular localization of the F-actin bands under hypoxia treatments. Addition of spermine NONOate (SPNO), a NO donor, or reoxygenation to endothelial monolayer attenuated hypoxia-mediated effects on endothelial permeability with partial recovery of endothelial integrity through actin remodeling. The present study indicates link of hypoxia-induced actin-associated cytoskeletal rearrangements and paracellular gaps in the endothelium with a low NO availability in the hypoxia milieu. The author concludes that NO confers protection against hypoxia-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling and endothelial leakiness.

Abstract: Mast cells in the peritoneal membrane (PM) may degranulate to release preformed inflammatory mediators including histamine which is capable of diffusing into the surrounding interstitium, modulating cells in their vicinity including, human peritoneal mesothelial cells (hPMC). The present study aimed to investigate the quorum intracellular calcium ([Ca2+i]) response to histamine compared to the membrane soluble ionophore, A23187, in adherent cultured hPMC. To examine [Ca2+i] handling, Fura - 2 loaded cells were exposed to histamine and A23187. Agonist induced transient [Ca2+i] event(s) (TCE) were defined and compared including, resting calcium, peak height, recovery and transient kinetics. Changes in cell shape were examined with immunocytochemistry of the cortical actin (CA) and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. To investigate whether histamine induced changes in cell shape were mediated by [Ca2+i], mobilization of [Ca2+i] was prevented with 20 μmol/l of the calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM). Histamine produced a dose dependent increase of [Ca2+i], maximal at 1.0 mmol/l which recovered to the pre-challenge resting value. Transient multiplicity with repeated challenge was evident below a histamine threshold of 10−2 mmol/l. Morphometric analysis of MTs and CA showed significant cell elongation plus histamine and A23187. The histamine induced cell elongation was eliminated with [Ca2+i] clamping. This data indicated that increased [Ca2+i] was essential for cell elongation and the formation of stress fibres and therefore has a pivotal role in the regulation of the PM barrier.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary habits that can induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are major colorectal cancer (CRC) risk factors, but mechanisms linking nutrients, IBD, and CRC are unknown. Using human data and mouse models, we show that mTORC1 inactivation-induced chromosomal instability impairs intestinal crypt proliferation and regeneration, CDK4/6 dependently. This triggers interleukin (IL)-6-associated reparative inflammation, inducing crypt hyper-proliferation, wound healing, and CRC. Blocking IL-6 signaling or reactivating mTORC1 reduces inflammation-induced CRC, so mTORC1 activation suppresses tumorigenesis in IBD. Conversely, mTORC1 inactivation is beneficial in APC loss-dependent CRC. Thus, IL-6 blockers or protein-rich-diet-linked mTORC1 activation may prevent IBD-associated CRC. However, abolishing mTORC1 can mitigate CRC in predisposed patients with APC mutations. Our work reveals mTORC1 oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in intestinal epithelium and avenues to optimized and personalized therapeutic regimens for CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple protein kinases regulate cell-cycle progression, of which the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are thought to act as upstream master regulators. We have used quantitative phosphoproteomics to analyze the fission yeast cell cycle at sufficiently high temporal resolution to distinguish fine-grain differences in substrate phosphorylation dynamics on a proteome-wide scale. This dataset provides a useful resource for investigating the regulatory dynamics of cell-cycle kinases and their substrates. For example, our analysis indicates that the substrates of different mitotic kinases (CDK, NIMA-related, Polo-like, and Aurora) are phosphorylated in sequential, kinase-specific waves during mitosis. Phosphoproteomics analysis after chemical-genetic manipulation of CDK activity suggests that the timing of these waves is established by the differential dependency of the downstream kinases on upstream CDK. We have also examined the temporal organization of phosphorylation during G1/S, as well as the coordination between the NDR-related kinase Orb6, which controls polarized growth, and other cell-cycle kinases.

Abstract: Introduction
Ethanol exposure to developing brain may alter the growth and differentiation of neurological cells resulting in unfavorable pathologies. Earlier studies have provided very limited mechanistic insights of cellular and molecular mechanisms which do not mimic with human situation due to varying cell types and poses potential challenges for investigation. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of ABC transporters and heat shock proteins mediated response in human neural precursor cells (NPCs) and its lineages during proliferation and lineage differentiation against ethanol exposure.
Methods
Effect of ethanol exposure was examined for neuronal cell survival and variation in cellular phenotype during neurospheres development and lineage differentiation. Generation of reactive oxygen species, and variation in cell cycle was identified along with transcriptional profiling for pluripotent markers (Nestin, NCAM, Sox-2, and Notch-2), drug transporters (ABCB1 and ABCG2) and stress protein (HSP70) during ethanol exposure.
Results
ABC transporters as well as HSP70 mRNA expression was higher during proliferation as compared to differentiation with chronic ethanol (1 M) exposure (p < 0.01). Ethanol exposure resulted in higher variability in size and shape of developing neurospheres and decreased ability to form new neurosphere colonies. Significant changes were observed in dendrite development due to late ethanol exposure (p < 0.0001).
Conclusion
The present study demonstrated significant role of ABC transporters and HSP70 proteins in providing defense against ethanol-induced damage in human neurological cells. However, the over-expression of ABC transporter and HSP-70 proteins during such pathological conditions do not provide complete defense and additional strategies are required to repair the damage.

Abstract: Summary
SLFN11 sensitizes cancer cells to a broad range of DNA-targeted therapies. Here we show that, in response to replication stress induced by camptothecin, SLFN11 tightly binds chromatin at stressed replication foci via RPA1 together with the replication helicase subunit MCM3. Unlike ATR, SLFN11 neither interferes with the loading of CDC45 and PCNA nor inhibits the initiation of DNA replication but selectively blocks fork progression while inducing chromatin opening across replication initiation sites. The ATPase domain of SLFN11 is required for chromatin opening, replication block, and cell death but not for the tight binding of SLFN11 to chromatin. Replication stress by the CHK1 inhibitor Prexasertib also recruits SLFN11 to nascent replicating DNA together with CDC45 and PCNA. We conclude that SLFN11 is recruited to stressed replication forks carrying extended RPA filaments where it blocks replication by changing chromatin structure across replication sites.

Retinoic acid inhibits neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels,

Abstract: Retinoic acid is the active metabolite of vitamin A and regulates several important cellular processes by activating retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR). These receptors generally act as transcription factors, though non-genomic actions of both retinoic acid and the receptors have also been reported. One such nongenomic effect includes the modulation of Ca2+ levels during homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Retinoic acid can thus affect Ca2+ signaling and can potentially control both synaptic plasticity and neuronal firing. However, whether retinoic acid can regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (either via genomic or nongenomic actions), which are fundamental to these processes, has not yet been studied in detail. Here we demonstrate the effects of retinoic acid on the biophysical properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in cultured invertebrate motorneurons. Overnight exposure to physiological concentrations of retinoic acid significantly inhibited the voltage-gated Ca2+ current (ICa) in an isomer-dependent manner. Specifically, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), but not 9-cis RA (9cRA), depolarized the voltage of half-maximal activation of ICa. AtRA also reduced the rate of channel activation and delayed recovery from inactivation. We provide evidence that both L-type and non-L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are affected by atRA, as both nifedipine-sensitive and nifedipine-resistant ICa were inhibited in these neurons. These effects of retinoic acid are thought to be at least partially mediated by the retinoid receptors, as treatment of the neurons with synthetic RAR and RXR agonists produced a similar inhibition of ICa.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosome membrane recycling occurs at the end of the autophagic pathway and requires proteins that are mostly encoded by genes mutated in neurodegenerative diseases. However, its implication in neuronal death is still unclear. Here, we show that spatacsin, which is required for lysosome recycling and whose loss of function leads to hereditary spastic paraplegia 11 (SPG11), promotes clearance of gangliosides from lysosomes in mouse and human SPG11 models. We demonstrate that spatacsin acts downstream of clathrin and recruits dynamin to allow lysosome membrane recycling and clearance of gangliosides from lysosomes. Gangliosides contributed to the accumulation of autophagy markers in lysosomes and to neuronal death. In contrast, decreasing ganglioside synthesis prevented neurodegeneration and improved motor phenotype in a SPG11 zebrafish model. Our work reveals how inhibition of lysosome membrane recycling leads to the deleterious accumulation of gangliosides, linking lysosome recycling to neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical in regulating the immune response. In vitro induced Treg (iTreg) cells have significant potential in clinical medicine. However, applying iTreg cells as therapeutics is complicated by the poor stability of human iTreg cells and their variable suppressive activity. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of human iTreg cell specification. We identified hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) as a transcription factor upregulated early during the differentiation of human iTreg cells. Although FOXP3 expression was unaffected, HIC1 deficiency led to a considerable loss of suppression by iTreg cells with a concomitant increase in the expression of effector T cell associated genes. SNPs linked to several immune-mediated disorders were enriched around HIC1 binding sites, and in vitro binding assays indicated that these SNPs may alter the binding of HIC1. Our results suggest that HIC1 is an important contributor to iTreg cell development and function.

Abstract: Summary
Trinucleotide repeat expansions involving CTG/CAG triplets are responsible for several neurodegenerative disorders, including myotonic dystrophy and Huntington’s disease. Because expansions trigger the disease, contracting repeat length could be a possible approach to gene therapy for these disorders. Here, we show that a TALEN-induced double-strand break was very efficient at contracting expanded CTG repeats in yeast. We show that RAD51, POL32, and DNL4 are dispensable for double-strand break repair within CTG repeats, the only required genes being RAD50, SAE2, and RAD52. Resection was totally abolished in the absence of RAD50 on both sides of the break, whereas it was reduced in a sae2Δ mutant on the side of the break containing the longest repeat tract, suggesting that secondary structures at double-strand break ends must be removed by the Mre11-Rad50 complex and Sae2. Following the TALEN double-strand break, single-strand annealing occurred between both sides of the repeat tract, leading to repeat contraction.

Abstract: Intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP typically cause opposing effects on airway smooth muscle contraction. Receptors that stimulate these pathways are therapeutic targets in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the interactions between different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that evoke cAMP and Ca2+ signals in human bronchial airway smooth muscle cells (hBASMCs) are poorly understood. We measured Ca2+ signals in cultures of fluo-4-loaded hBASMCs alongside measurements of intracellular cAMP using mass spectrometry or [3H]-adenine labeling. Interactions between the signaling pathways were examined using selective ligands of GPCRs, and inhibitors of Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways. Histamine stimulated Ca2+ release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors in hBASMCs. β2-adrenoceptors, through cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA), substantially inhibited histamine-evoked Ca2+ signals. Responses to other Ca2+-mobilizing stimuli were unaffected by cAMP (carbachol and bradykinin) or minimally affected (lysophosphatidic acid). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), through EP2 and EP4 receptors, stimulated formation of cAMP and inhibited histamine-evoked Ca2+ signals. There was no consistent relationship between the inhibition of Ca2+ signals and the amounts of intracellular cAMP produced by different stimuli. We conclude that β-adrenoceptors, EP2 and EP4 receptors, through cAMP and PKA, selectively inhibit Ca2+ signals evoked by histamine in hBASMCs, suggesting that PKA inhibits an early step in H1 receptor signaling. Local delivery of cAMP within hyperactive signaling junctions mediates the inhibition.

Abstract: Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is involved in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. However, its role in lymphangiogenesis has been unknown. Here, we tested whether downregulation of DDR1 expression by miR-199a/b can suppress lymphangiogenesis. We also aimed to identify miRNA target site(s) in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of DDR1. Transfection with miR-199a/b-5p mimics reduced expression of DDR1 and tube formation in primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells, whereas miR-199a/b-5p inhibitors showed the opposite effects. Critically, injection of miR-199a/b-5p mimics suppressed DDR1 expression and lymphangiogenesis in a corneal alkali-burn rat model. The three well-conserved seed matched sites for miR-199a/b-5p in the DDR1 3′-UTR were targeted, and miRNA binding to at least two sites was required for DDR1 inhibition. Our data suggest that DDR1 promotes enhanced lymphangiogenesis during eye injury, and miR-199a/b-5p suppresses this activity by inhibiting DDR1 expression. Thus, this miRNA may be useful for the treatment of lymphangiogenesis-related eye diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are a dominant leukocyte population in the tumor microenvironment and actively promote cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of macrophages remains poorly understood. Here we show that polarized M2 macrophages enhance 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1)-mediated phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) threonine (T) 243 phosphorylation in tumor cells by secreting interleukin-6 (IL-6). This phosphorylation facilitates a PGK1-catalyzed reaction toward glycolysis by altering substrate affinity. Inhibition of PGK1 T243 phosphorylation or PDPK1 in tumor cells or neutralization of macrophage-derived IL-6 abrogates macrophage-promoted glycolysis, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. In addition, PGK1 T243 phosphorylation correlates with PDPK1 activation, IL-6 expression, and macrophage infiltration in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Moreover, PGK1 T243 phosphorylation also correlates with malignance and prognosis of human GBM. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of macrophage-promoted tumor growth by regulating tumor cell metabolism, implicating the therapeutic potential to disrupt the connection between macrophages and tumor cells by inhibiting PGK1 phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in KDM5 family histone demethylases cause intellectual disability in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms linking KDM5-regulated transcription and cognition remain unknown. Here, we establish Drosophila as a model to understand this connection by generating a fly strain harboring an allele analogous to a disease-causing missense mutation in human KDM5C (kdm5A512P). Transcriptome analysis of kdm5A512P flies revealed a striking downregulation of genes required for ribosomal assembly and function and a concomitant reduction in translation. kdm5A512P flies also showed impaired learning and/or memory. Significantly, the behavioral and transcriptional changes in kdm5A512P flies were similar to those specifically lacking demethylase activity. These data suggest that the primary defect of the KDM5A512P mutation is a loss of histone demethylase activity and reveal an unexpected role for this enzymatic function in gene activation. Because translation is critical for neuronal function, we propose that this defect contributes to the cognitive defects of kdm5A512P flies.

Abstract: Aortic dissection (AD) is a catastrophic disease with high mortality and morbidity, characterized with fragmentation of elastin and loss of smooth muscle cells. Although AD has been largely attributable to polymorphisms defect in the elastin-coding gene, tropoelastin (TE), other undermined factors also appear to play roles in AD onset. Here, we investigated the effects of post-transcriptional control of TE by microRNAs (miRNAs) on elastin levels in aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC). We found that miR-144-3p is a miRNA that targets TE mRNA in both human and mouse. Bioinformatics analyses and dual luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-144-3p inhibited protein translation of TE, through binding to the 3′-UTR of the TE mRNA. Interestingly, higher miR-144-3p levels and lower TE were detected in the ASMC obtained from AD patients, compared to those from non-AD controls. In a mouse model for human AD, infusion of adeno-associated viruses (serotype 6) carrying antisense for miR-144-3p (as-miR-144-3p) under CAG promoter significantly reduced the incidence and severity of AD, seemingly through enhancement of TE levels in ASMC. Thus, our data suggest an essential role of miR-144-3p on the pathogenesis of AD.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes with pivotal roles in the resistance against various tumors; dysfunction of NK cells often results in advanced tumor progression. Tumors develop in three stages comprising initiation, promotion, and progression, but little is known about the interrelationships between NK cells and tumor cells at different stages of tumor development. Here, we demonstrated that NK cells prevented tumor initiation potently but did not prevent tumor promotion or tumor progression in Kras-driven lung cancer. Moreover, loss of the antitumor effect in NK cells was closely associated with their dysfunctional state during tumor promotion and progression. Mechanistically, aberrant fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) expression in NK cells elicited their dysfunction by inhibiting glycolysis and impairing viability. Thus, our results show dynamic alterations of NK cells during tumor development and uncover a novel mechanism involved in NK cell dysfunction, suggesting potential directions for NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy involving FBP1 targeting.

Abstract: In recent years, the interest towards the relationship between incretins and bone has been increasing. Previous studies have suggested that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its receptor agonists exert beneficial anabolic influence on skeletal metabolism, such as promoting proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts via entero-osseous-axis. However, little is known regarding the effects of GLP-1 on osteoblast apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms involved. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on apoptosis of murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. We confirmed the presence of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in MC3T3-E1 cells. Our data demonstrated that liraglutide inhibited the apoptosis of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells induced by serum deprivation, as detected by Annexin V/PI and Hoechst 33258 staining and ELISA assays. Moreover, liraglutide upregulated Bcl-2 expression and downregulated Bax expression and caspase-3 activity at intermediate concentration (100 nM) for maximum effect. Further study suggested that liraglutide stimulated the phosphorylation of AKT and enhanced cAMP level, along with decreased phosphorylation of GSK3β, increased β-catenin phosphorylation at Ser675 site and upregulated nuclear β-catenin content and transcriptional activity. Pretreatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, PKA inhibitor H89, and siRNAs GLP-1R, β-catenin abrogated the liraglutide-induced activation of cAMP, AKT, β-catenin, respectively. In conclusion, these findings illustrate that activation of GLP-1 receptor by liraglutide inhibits the apoptosis of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells induced by serum deprivation through cAMP/PKA/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathways.

Abstract: The taxon Tardigrada, commonly called “water bears”, consists of microscopic, eight-legged invertebrates that are well known for their ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Their miniscule body size means that tardigrades possess a small total number of cells, the number and arrangement of which may be highly conserved in some organs. Although mitoses have been observed in several organs, the rate and pattern of cell divisions in adult tardigrades has never been characterized. In this study, we incubated live tardigrades over a period of several days with a thymidine analog in order to visualize all cells that had divided during this time. We focus on the midgut, the largest part of the digestive system. Our results show that new cells in the midgut arise from the anterior and posterior ends of this organ and either migrate or divide toward its middle. These cells divide at a constant rate and all cells of the midgut epithelium are replaced in approximately one week. On the other hand, we found no cell divisions in the nervous system or any other major organs, suggesting that the cell turnover of these organs may be extremely slow or dependent on changing environmental conditions.

Abstract: This study examined the effects of low oxygen tension on the osteogenic differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in a three-dimensional culture system. The high expression levels of hypoxia-related proteins hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor were first validated in ESCs subjected to hypoxic conditions compared with normoxic controls. The osteogenic differentiation of hypoxic ESCs with either osteogenic or osteogenic factor-free media was subsequently evaluated by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity, intracellular calcium levels, matrix mineralization, and the protein levels of osteogenic markers Runt-related transcription factor 2 and osterix. We confirmed that hypoxia significantly stimulated ESC osteogenic activity; the strongest stimulation of ESC osteogenesis was exerted when cells were grown in osteogenic media. To identify differentially expressed genes associated with hypoxia-induced ESC differentiation, we performed microarray analysis of ESCs cultured in osteogenic media under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This study demonstrated that differences in oxygen tension induced the differential expression of genes known to play roles in such processes as skeletal system development and signaling pathways for bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt, Notch, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and integrin. These findings reveal the effects of low oxygen tension on osteogenic progression in ESCs and provide insight into the molecular pathways that regulate ESC differentiation following exposure to hypoxia.

Abstract: Summary
Tight regulation of neuronal transport allows for cargo binding and release at specific cellular locations. The mechanisms by which motor proteins are loaded on vesicles and how cargoes are captured at appropriate sites remain unclear. To better understand how KIF1A-driven dense core vesicle (DCV) transport is regulated, we identified the KIF1A interactome and focused on three binding partners, the calcium binding protein calmodulin (CaM) and two synaptic scaffolding proteins: liprin-α and TANC2. We showed that calcium, acting via CaM, enhances KIF1A binding to DCVs and increases vesicle motility. In contrast, liprin-α and TANC2 are not part of the KIF1A-cargo complex but capture DCVs at dendritic spines. Furthermore, we found that specific TANC2 mutations—reported in patients with different neuropsychiatric disorders—abolish the interaction with KIF1A. We propose a model in which Ca2+/CaM regulates cargo binding and liprin-α and TANC2 recruit KIF1A-transported vesicles.

Abstract: Hyperamylinemia is a condition that accompanies obesity and precedes type II diabetes, and it is characterized by above-normal blood levels of amylin, the pancreas-derived peptide. Human amylin oligomerizes easily and can deposit in the pancreas [1], brain [2], and heart [3], where they have been associated with calcium dysregulation. In the heart, accumulating evidence suggests that human amylin oligomers form moderately cation-selective [[4], [5]] channels that embed in the cell sarcolemma (SL). The oligomers increase membrane conductance in a concentration-dependent manner [5], which is correlated with elevated cytosolic Ca2+. These findings motivate our core hypothesis that non-selective inward Ca2+ conduction afforded by human amylin oligomers increase cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, which thereby magnifies intracellular Ca2+ transients. Questions remain however regarding the mechanism of amylin-induced Ca2+ dysregulation, including whether enhanced SL Ca2+ influx is sufficient to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ load [6], and if so, how might amplified Ca2+ transients perturb Ca2+-dependent cardiac pathways. To investigate these questions, we modified a computational model of cardiomyocytes Ca2+ signaling to reflect experimentally-measured changes in SL membrane permeation and decreased sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) function stemming from acute and transgenic human amylin peptide exposure. With this model, we confirmed the hypothesis that increasing SL permeation alone was sufficient to enhance Ca2+ transient amplitudes. Our model indicated that amplified cytosolic transients are driven by increased Ca2+ loading of the SR and that greater fractional release may contribute to the Ca2+-dependent activation of calmodulin, which could prime the activation of myocyte remodeling pathways. Importantly, elevated Ca2+ in the SR and dyadic space collectively drive greater fractional SR Ca2+ release for human amylin expressing rats (HIP) and acute amylin-exposed rats (+Amylin) mice, which contributes to the inotropic rise in cytosolic Ca2+ transients. These findings suggest that increased membrane permeation induced by oligomeratization of amylin peptide in cell sarcolemma contributes to Ca2+ dysregulation in pre-diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
The programmed formation of hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential for proper meiosis and fertility. In mice and humans, the location of these breaks is determined by the meiosis-specific protein PRDM9, through the DNA-binding specificity of its zinc-finger domain. PRDM9 also has methyltransferase activity. Here, we show that this activity is required for H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 deposition and for DSB formation at PRDM9-binding sites. By analyzing mice that express two PRDM9 variants with distinct DNA-binding specificities, we show that each variant generates its own set of H3K4me3 marks independently from the other variant. Altogether, we reveal several basic principles of PRDM9-dependent DSB site determination, in which an excess of sites are designated through PRDM9 binding and subsequent histone methylation, from which a subset is selected for DSB formation.

Abstract: Summary
Naive CD4+ T cells can be converted to Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the periphery (iTregs), where induction of Foxp3 gene expression is central to Treg differentiation. OX40 signaling is known to inhibit Foxp3 expression and Treg induction, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we found that OX40 costimulation activates two distinct molecular pathways to suppress Foxp3 expression in freshly activated naive CD4+ T cells. Specifically, OX40 upregulates BATF3 and BATF, which produce a closed chromatin configuration to repress Foxp3 expression in a Sirt1/7-dependent manner. Moreover, OX40 can also activate the AKT-mTOR pathway, especially in the absence of BATF3 and BATF, to inhibit Foxp3 induction, and this is mediated by phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor Foxo1. Taken together, our results provide key mechanistic insights into how OX40 inhibits Foxp3 expression and Treg induction in the periphery.

Abstract: Arabinogalactan (AG) is an essential structural macromolecule present in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, serving to connect peptidoglycan with the outer mycolic acid layer. The D-arabinan segment is a highly branched component of AG and is assembled in a step-wise fashion by a variety of arabinofuranosyltransferases (AraT). We have previously used Corynebacterium glutamicum as a model organism to study these complex processes which are otherwise essential in mycobacteria. In order to further our understanding of the molecular basis of AG assembly, we investigated the role of a fourth AraT, now termed AftD by generating single (ΔaftD) and double deletion (ΔaftB ΔaftD) mutants of C. glutamicum. We demonstrate that AftD functions as an α(1 → 5) AraT and reveal the point at which it exerts its activity in the AG biosynthetic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is critical for thermoregulation and contributes to total energy expenditure. However, whether BAT has non-thermogenic functions is largely unknown. Here, we describe that BAT-specific liver kinase b1 knockout (Lkb1BKO) mice exhibited impaired BAT mitochondrial respiration and thermogenesis but reduced adiposity and liver triglyceride accumulation under high-fat-diet feeding at room temperature. Importantly, these metabolic benefits were also present in Lkb1BKO mice at thermoneutrality, where BAT thermogenesis was not required. Mechanistically, decreased mRNA levels of mtDNA-encoded electron transport chain (ETC) subunits and ETC proteome imbalance led to defective BAT mitochondrial respiration in Lkb1BKO mice. Furthermore, reducing mtDNA gene expression directly in BAT by removing mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in BAT also showed ETC proteome imbalance and the trade-off between BAT thermogenesis and systemic metabolism at room temperature and thermoneutrality. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ETC proteome imbalance in BAT regulates systemic metabolism independently of thermogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Organoid technology provides the possibility of culturing patient-derived colon tissue and colorectal cancers (CRCs) while maintaining all functional and phenotypic characteristics. Labeling stem cells, especially in normal and benign tumor organoids of human colon, is challenging and therefore limits maximal exploitation of organoid libraries for human stem cell research. Here, we developed STAR (stem cell Ascl2 reporter), a minimal enhancer/promoter element that reports transcriptional activity of ASCL2, a master regulator of LGR5+ intestinal stem cells. Using lentiviral infection, STAR drives specific expression in stem cells of normal organoids and in multiple engineered and patient-derived CRC organoids of different genetic makeup. STAR reveals that differentiation hierarchies and the potential for cell fate plasticity are present at all stages of human CRC development. Organoid technology, in combination with the user-friendly nature of STAR, will facilitate basic research into human adult stem cell biology.

Abstract: Summary
Female hawkmoths, Manduca sexta, use olfactory cues to locate nectar sources and oviposition sites. We investigated if the behavioral significance of odorants is represented already in the antennal lobe, the first olfactory neuropil of the insect′s brain. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we first established a functional map of the dorsal surface of the antennal lobe by stimulating the moths with 80 ecologically relevant and chemically diverse monomolecular odorants. We were able to address 23 olfactory glomeruli, functional subunits of the antennal lobe, in each individual female. Next, we studied the relevance of the same odorants with two-choice experiments (odorant versus solvent) in a wind tunnel. Depending on odorant identity, naive moths made attempts to feed or to oviposit at the scented targets. A correlation of wind tunnel results with glomerular activation patterns revealed that feeding and oviposition behaviors are encoded in the moth’s antennal lobe by the activation of distinct groups of glomeruli.

Abstract: Summary
The lysine-specific demethylase KDM1A is a key regulator of stem cell potential in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). ORY-1001 is a highly potent and selective KDM1A inhibitor that induces H3K4me2 accumulation on KDM1A target genes, blast differentiation, and reduction of leukemic stem cell capacity in AML. ORY-1001 exhibits potent synergy with standard-of-care drugs and selective epigenetic inhibitors, reduces growth of an AML xenograft model, and extends survival in a mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) model of T cell acute leukemia. Surrogate pharmacodynamic biomarkers developed based on expression changes in leukemia cell lines were translated to samples from patients treated with ORY-1001. ORY-1001 is a selective KDM1A inhibitor in clinical trials and is currently being evaluated in patients with leukemia and solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Highly effective HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies could have utility in the prevention or treatment of HIV-1 infection. To improve the potency of 10E8, an antibody capable of near pan-HIV-1 neutralization, we engineered 10E8-surface mutants and screened for improved neutralization. Variants with the largest functional enhancements involved the addition of hydrophobic or positively charged residues, which were positioned to interact with viral membrane lipids or viral glycan-sialic acids, respectively. In both cases, the site of improvement was spatially separated from the region of antibody mediating molecular contact with the protein component of the antigen, thereby improving peripheral semi-specific interactions while maintaining unmodified dominant contacts responsible for broad recognition. The optimized 10E8 antibody, with mutations to phenylalanine and arginine, retained the extraordinary breadth of 10E8 but with ∼10-fold increased potency. We propose surface-matrix screening as a general method to improve antibodies, with improved semi-specific interactions between antibody and antigen enabling increased potency without compromising breadth.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatin plays a central role in the process of immune evasion, pathogenesis, and transmission of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum during blood stage infection. Here, we use ChIP sequencing to demonstrate that sporozoites from mosquito salivary glands expand heterochromatin at subtelomeric regions to silence blood-stage-specific genes. Our data also revealed that heterochromatin enrichment is predictive of the transcription status of clonally variant genes members that mediate cytoadhesion in blood stage parasites. A specific member (here called NF54varsporo) of the var gene family remains euchromatic, and the resultant PfEMP1 (NF54_SpzPfEMP1) is expressed at the sporozoite surface. NF54_SpzPfEMP1-specific antibodies efficiently block hepatocyte infection in a strain-specific manner. Furthermore, human volunteers immunized with infective sporozoites developed antibodies against NF54_SpzPfEMP1. Overall, we show that the epigenetic signature of var genes is reset in mosquito stages. Moreover, the identification of a strain-specific sporozoite PfEMP1 is highly relevant for vaccine design based on sporozoites.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence is a potent tumor-suppressive response. Paradoxically, senescence also induces an inflammatory secretome that promotes carcinogenesis and age-related pathologies. Consequently, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is a potential therapeutic target. Here, we describe an RNAi screen for SASP regulators. We identified 50 druggable targets whose knockdown suppresses the inflammatory secretome and differentially affects other SASP components. Among the screen candidates was PTBP1. PTBP1 regulates the alternative splicing of genes involved in intracellular trafficking, such as EXOC7, to control the SASP. Inhibition of PTBP1 prevents the pro-tumorigenic effects of the SASP and impairs immune surveillance without increasing the risk of tumorigenesis. In conclusion, our study identifies SASP inhibition as a powerful and safe therapy against inflammation-driven cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the clinical successes fostered by immune checkpoint inhibitors, mechanisms underlying PD-1 upregulation in tumor-infiltrating T cells remain an enigma. Here, we show that tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs) drive PD-1 upregulation in CD8+ T cells through a transcellular kynurenine (Kyn)-aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. Interferon-γ produced by CD8+ T cells stimulates release of high levels of Kyn produced by TRCs, which is transferred into adjacent CD8+ T cells via the transporters SLC7A8 and PAT4. Kyn induces and activates AhR and thereby upregulates PD-1 expression. This Kyn-AhR pathway is confirmed in both tumor-bearing mice and cancer patients and its blockade enhances antitumor adoptive T cell therapy efficacy. Thus, we uncovered a mechanism of PD-1 upregulation with potential tumor immunotherapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Protein self-assemblies modulate protein activities over biological timescales that can exceed the lifetimes of the proteins or even the cells that harbor them. We hypothesized that these timescales relate to kinetic barriers inherent to the nucleation of ordered phases. To investigate nucleation barriers in living cells, we developed distributed amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET). DAmFRET exploits a photoconvertible fluorophore, heterogeneous expression, and large cell numbers to quantify via flow cytometry the extent of a protein’s self-assembly as a function of cellular concentration. We show that kinetic barriers limit the nucleation of ordered self-assemblies and that the persistence of the barriers with respect to concentration relates to structure. Supersaturation resulting from sequence-encoded nucleation barriers gave rise to prion behavior and enabled a prion-forming protein, Sup35 PrD, to partition into dynamic intracellular condensates or to form toxic aggregates. Our results suggest that nucleation barriers govern cytoplasmic inheritance, subcellular organization, and proteotoxicity.

Abstract: The glycoconjugates pattern of acidic secretions and distribution of chemosensory cells (SCCs) in the respiratory mucosa of dromedary camels were analyzed so as to identify their functional role. Secretions of the goblet cells and mucous glandular cells were analyzed to evaluate the variety of sugar chains, focusing on the acidic glycoconjugates. Using lectin histochemistry, WGA, STL, DBA, SBA, VVA and RCA-120 intensely bound to the goblet cells. PNA and ECL labeled the goblet cells with moderate intensity. While, s-WGA, UEA-I faintly bound to them. Lectins bound to the glycocalyx: WGA, LEL, STL, DSL, DBA, SBA, VVA, RCA-120, ECL and PHA-L (tetra- and tri-antennary N-glycans). The mucous secretory cells reacted with: WGA, s-WGA, STL, DBA, SBA, ECL and Con A. Glycoconjugates secreted by the camel respiratory mucosa are rich in sialomucins, glucosaminy-lated residuals with some galactosyl/galactosaminylated residues; few L-fucose and mannosylated sugar residues are also included. For identification of SCCs, the camel respiratory mucosa was immunostained with phospholipase C-β2 (PLC-β2), a taste signaling marker. Several PLC-β2 immunoreactive cells were detected in camel respiratory epithelium. Finally, prevalence of sialomucins and SCCs which can respond to noxious chemicals may suggest a vital role in optimizing physiological and pathological reactions in camel respiratory mucosa.

Abstract: Summary
Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-dependent upper small intestinal lipid metabolism activates pre-absorptive pathways to regulate metabolic homeostasis, but whether changes in the upper small intestinal microbiota alter specific fatty acid-dependent pathways to impact glucose homeostasis remains unknown. We here first find that upper small intestinal infusion of Intralipid, oleic acid, or linoleic acid pre-absorptively increases glucose tolerance and lowers glucose production in rodents. High-fat feeding impairs pre-absorptive fatty acid sensing and reduces upper small intestinal Lactobacillus gasseri levels and ACSL3 expression. Transplantation of healthy upper small intestinal microbiota to high-fat-fed rodents restores L. gasseri levels and fatty acid sensing via increased ACSL3 expression, while L. gasseri probiotic administration to non-transplanted high-fat-fed rodents is sufficient to restore upper small intestinal ACSL3 expression and fatty acid sensing. In summary, we unveil a glucoregulatory role of upper small intestinal L. gasseri that impacts an ACSL3-dependent glucoregulatory fatty acid-sensing pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is a main cytoskeletal regulator in B cells. WASp-interacting protein (WIP) binds to and stabilizes WASp but also interacts with actin. Using mice with a mutated actin binding domain of WIP (WIPΔABD), we here investigated the role of WIP binding to actin during B cell activation. We found an altered differentiation of WIPΔABD B cells and diminished antibody affinity maturation after immunization. Mechanistically, WIPΔABD B cells showed impaired B cell receptor (BCR)-induced PI3K signaling and actin reorganization, likely caused by diminished CD81 expression and altered CD19 dynamics on the B cell surface. WIPΔABD B cells displayed reduced in vivo motility, concomitantly with impaired chemotaxis and defective F-actin polarization, HS1 phosphorylation, and polarization of HS1 to F-actin-rich structures after CXCL12 stimulation in vitro. We thus concluded that WIP binding to actin, independent of its binding to WASp, is critical for actin cytoskeleton plasticity in B cells.

Abstract: Summary
The deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) represent output channels of the cerebellum, and they transmit integrated sensorimotor signals to modulate limb movements. But the functional relevance of identifiable neuronal subpopulations within the DCN remains unclear. Here, we examine a genetically tractable population of neurons in the mouse interposed anterior nucleus (IntA). We show that these neurons represent a subset of glutamatergic neurons in the IntA and constitute a specific element of an internal feedback circuit within the cerebellar cortex and cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway associated with limb control. Ablation and optogenetic stimulation of these neurons disrupt efficacy of skilled reach and locomotor movement and reveal that they control positioning and timing of the forelimb and hindlimb. Together, our findings uncover the function of a distinct neuronal subpopulation in the deep cerebellum and delineate the anatomical substrates and kinematic parameters through which it modulates precision of discrete and rhythmic limb movements.

Abstract: Summary
Uveal melanoma (UM) is characterized by mutually exclusive activating mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, and PLCB4, four genes in a linear pathway to activation of PLCβ in almost all tumors and loss of BAP1 in the aggressive subset. We generated mice with melanocyte-specific expression of GNA11Q209L with and without homozygous Bap1 loss. The GNA11Q209L mice recapitulated human Gq-associated melanomas, and they developed pigmented neoplastic lesions from melanocytes of the skin and non-cutaneous organs, including the eye and leptomeninges, as well as at atypical sites, including the lymph nodes and lungs. The addition of Bap1 loss increased tumor proliferation and cutaneous melanoma size. Integrative transcriptome analysis of human and murine melanomas identified RasGRP3 to be specifically expressed in GNAQ/GNA11-driven melanomas. In human UM cell lines and murine models, RasGRP3 is specifically required for GNAQ/GNA11-driven Ras activation and tumorigenesis. This implicates RasGRP3 as a critical node and a potential target in UM.

Abstract: Karyopherin β1 (Kpnβ1), also known as importin-β, is part of the karyopherin superfamily of nuclear transport proteins. Kpnβ1 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in various human cancers. Recent studies have showed that Kpnβ1 is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the world. However, the role of Kpnβ1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains uncertain. In this study, we used western blotting to show that Kpnβ1 expression is higher in lung-cancer tissues and cells, and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that Kpnβ1 was significantly associated with the clinicopathological features of NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated Kpnβ1 expression correlated with a poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Serum starvation-refeeding experiments and Kpnβ1-shRNA transfection assays revealed that elevated Kpnβ1 expression promoted cell proliferation and reduced sensitivity to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that Kpnβ1 interacts with PI3 K to activate the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway, leading to enhanced cell survival and drug resistance in NSCLC cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that Kpnβ1 plays a significant role in NSCLC progression and chemoresistance. Our study provides new insights for targeted therapy to treat NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Development of resistance causes failure of drugs targeting receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) networks and represents a critical challenge for precision medicine. Here, we show that PHLDA1 downregulation is critical to acquisition and maintenance of drug resistance in RTK-driven cancer. Using fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibition in endometrial cancer cells, we identify an Akt-driven compensatory mechanism underpinned by downregulation of PHLDA1. We demonstrate broad clinical relevance of our findings, showing that PHLDA1 downregulation also occurs in response to RTK-targeted therapy in breast and renal cancer patients, as well as following trastuzumab treatment in HER2+ breast cancer cells. Crucially, knockdown of PHLDA1 alone was sufficient to confer de novo resistance to RTK inhibitors and induction of PHLDA1 expression re-sensitized drug-resistant cancer cells to targeted therapies, identifying PHLDA1 as a biomarker for drug response and highlighting the potential of PHLDA1 reactivation as a means of circumventing drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Expression of PKM2, which diverts glucose-derived carbon from catabolic to biosynthetic pathways, is a hallmark of cancer. However, PKM2 function in tumorigenesis remains controversial. Here, we show that, when expressed rather than PKM2, the PKM isoform PKM1 exhibits a tumor-promoting function in KRASG12D-induced or carcinogen-initiated mouse models or in some human cancers. Analysis of Pkm mutant mouse lines expressing specific PKM isoforms established that PKM1 boosts tumor growth cell intrinsically. PKM1 activated glucose catabolism and stimulated autophagy/mitophagy, favoring malignancy. Importantly, we observed that pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), including small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), express PKM1, and that PKM1 expression is required for SCLC cell proliferation. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting PKM1 therapeutically in certain cancer subtypes, including pulmonary NETs.

Abstract: HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) is a class of multifunctional protein, participated in various physiological processes such as cell apoptosis, proliferation and motility. However, the HAX1 expression and function in the spinal cord injury (SCI) pathological process have not been investigated. In our current research, the rat model of SCI was established, and then we explored the possible role of HAX1 after SCI. The results of western blot indicated that HAX1 was present in sham operated control group and significantly elevated at 3 days post SCI, then declined gradually. Immunohistochemical studies indicated HAX1 expression was enhanced significantly in white and gray matter at 3 days post SCI compared with sham operated group. Double immunofluorescence staining showed the proportion of cells, double-labeled HAX1 and neurons, astrocytes, increased significantly at 3 days post SCI. In addition, co-localization of HAX1/active caspase-3 and HAX1/PCNA was tested in cells. Furthermore, over-expression of HAX1 inhibited neuronal apoptosis in vitro, and in astrocytes HAX1 silencing could down-regulate PCNA expression post LPS treatment. Meanwhile, CCK8 assay showed that knockdown of HAX1 could inhibit the astrocyte proliferation. In summary, our data indicated that HAX1 might play significant roles in pathological process of neuronal apoptosis and astrocyte proliferation during SCI.

Abstract: Desfluraneis a widely-used general anesthetics. However, recent reports showed its significant side effect in the nervous system. Desflurane could lead to the neuronal death and affect the working memory. Unfortunately, the mechanism underlying the action of desflurane is still not clear and there is still no potent medicine to prevent the lesion in the central nervous system caused by general anesthetics. In this study, we found α-lipoic acid, an antioxidant exerting protective effect on multiple cells tissues, could resist the neurotoxicity caused by desflurane exposure. Lipoic acid possessed strong anti-apoptotic effect on the desflurane-treated hippocampal neurons, which was mediated by the Caspase-3 dependent pathway and NF-kappaB signaling. Collectively, we found a promising candidate to be clinically applied in intervention against the damage in nervous system by the desflurane.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence indicates that the MDM2 oncoprotein promotes tumorigenesis beyond its canonical negative effects on the p53 tumor suppressor, but these p53-independent functions remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a fraction of endogenous MDM2 is actively imported in mitochondria to control respiration and mitochondrial dynamics independently of p53. Mitochondrial MDM2 represses the transcription of NADH-dehydrogenase 6 (MT-ND6) in vitro and in vivo, impinging on respiratory complex I activity and enhancing mitochondrial ROS production. Recruitment of MDM2 to mitochondria increases during oxidative stress and hypoxia. Accordingly, mice lacking MDM2 in skeletal muscles exhibit higher MT-ND6 levels, enhanced complex I activity, and increased muscular endurance in mild hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial MDM2 levels enhance the migratory and invasive properties of cancer cells. Collectively, these data uncover a previously unsuspected function of the MDM2 oncoprotein in mitochondria that play critical roles in skeletal muscle physiology and may contribute to tumor progression.

Abstract: Proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from biological fluid is a powerful approach to discover potential biomarkers for human diseases including cancers, as EV secreted to biological fluids are originated from the affected tissue. In order to investigate significant molecules related to the pathogenesis of bladder cancer, EVs were isolated from patient urine which was analyzed by mass spectrometry based proteomics. Comparison of the EV proteome to the whole urine proteome demonstrated an increased number of protein identification in EV. Comparative MS analyses of urinary EV from control subjects and bladder cancer patients identified a total of 1,222 proteins. Statistical analyses provided 56 proteins significantly increased in bladder cancer urine, including proteins for which expression levels varied by cancer stage (P-value < 0.05). While urine represents a valuable, noninvasive specimen for biomarker discovery in urologic cancers, there is a high degree of intra- and inter-individual variability in urine samples. The enrichment of urinary EV demonstrated its capability and applicability of providing a focused identification of biologically relevant proteins in urological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are considered a heterogeneous cell population. To further resolve the HSC compartment, we characterized a retinoic acid (RA) reporter mouse line. Sub-fractionation of the HSC compartment in RA-CFP reporter mice demonstrated that RA-CFP-dim HSCs were largely non-proliferative and displayed superior engraftment potential in comparison with RA-CFP-bright HSCs. Gene expression analysis demonstrated higher expression of RA-target genes in RA-CFP-dim HSCs, in contrast to the RA-CFP reporter expression, but both RA-CFP-dim and RA-CFP-bright HSCs responded efficiently to RA in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of >1,200 HSCs showed that differences in cell cycle activity constituted the main driver of transcriptional heterogeneity in HSCs. Moreover, further analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data revealed that stochastic low-level expression of distinct lineage-affiliated transcriptional programs is a common feature of HSCs. Collectively, this work demonstrates the utility of the RA-CFP reporter line as a tool for the isolation of superior HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents premature segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. This process requires structural remodeling of MAD2 from O-MAD2 to C-MAD2 conformation. After the checkpoint is satisfied, C-MAD2 is reverted to O-MAD2 to allow anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to trigger anaphase. Recently, the AAA+-ATPase TRIP13 was shown to act in concert with p31comet to catalyze C- to O-MAD2. Paradoxically, although C-MAD2 is present in TRIP13-deficient cells, the SAC cannot be activated. Using a degron-mediated system to uncouple TRIP13 from O- and C-MAD2 equilibrium, we demonstrated that the loss of TRIP13 did not immediately abolish the SAC, but the resulting C-MAD2-only environment was insufficient to enable the SAC. These results favor a model in which MAD2-CDC20 interaction is coupled directly to the conversion of O- to C-MAD2 instead of one that involves unliganded C-MAD2. TRIP13 replenishes the O-MAD2 pool for activation by unattached kinetochores.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 interferon (T1IFN) signaling promotes inflammation and lupus pathology, but its role in autoreactive B cell development in the antibody-forming cell (AFC) and germinal center (GC) pathways is unclear. Using a lupus model that allows for focused study of the AFC and GC responses, we show that T1IFN signaling is crucial for autoreactive B cell development in the AFC and GC pathways. Through bone marrow chimeras, DNA-reactive B cell transfer, and GC-specific Cre mice, we confirm that IFNαR signaling in B cells promotes autoreactive B cell development into both pathways. Transcriptomic analysis reveals gene expression alterations in multiple signaling pathways in non-GC and GC B cells in the absence of IFNαR. Finally, we find that T1IFN signaling promotes autoreactive B cell development in the AFC and GC pathways by regulating BCR signaling. These data suggest value for anti-IFNαR therapy in individuals with elevated T1IFN activity before clinical disease onset.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer cells relocate to bone and activate osteoclast-induced bone resorption. Soluble factors secreted by breast cancer cells trigger a cascade of events that stimulate osteoclast differentiation in the bone microenvironment. MacroH2A is a unique histone variant with a C-terminal non-histone domain and plays a crucial role in modulating chromatin organization and gene transcription. Here, we show that macroH2A1.2, one of the macroH2A isoforms, has an intrinsic ability to inhibit breast cancer-derived osteoclastogenesis. This repressive effect requires macroH2A1.2-dependent attenuation of expression and secretion of lysyl oxidase (LOX) in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our mechanistic studies reveal that macroH2A1.2 physically and functionally interacts with the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and elevates H3K27me3 levels to keep LOX gene in a repressed state. Collectively, this study unravels a role for macroH2A1.2 in regulating osteoclastogenic potential of breast cancer cells, suggesting possibilities for developing therapeutic tools to treat osteolytic bone destruction.

Abstract: Summary
HOX proteins achieve numerous functions by interacting with the TALE class PBX and MEIS cofactors. In contrast to this established partnership in development and disease, how HOX proteins could interact with PBX and MEIS remains unclear. Here, we present a systematic analysis of HOX/PBX/MEIS interaction properties, scanning all paralog groups with human and mouse HOX proteins in vitro and in live cells. We demonstrate that a previously characterized HOX protein motif known to be critical for HOX-PBX interactions becomes dispensable in the presence of MEIS in all except the two most anterior paralog groups. We further identify paralog-specific TALE-binding sites that are used in a highly context-dependent manner. One of these binding sites is involved in the proliferative activity of HOXA7 in breast cancer cells. Together these findings reveal an extraordinary level of interaction flexibility between HOX proteins and their major class of developmental cofactors.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes play important roles in regulating cardiovascular health and disease. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the endocrine role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in pathological cardiac remodeling remains unknown. Herein we show that adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) knockout (A2ARKO) causes interscapular BAT (iBAT) dysfunction, leading to accelerated cardiac remodeling in hypertension compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Surgical iBAT depletion induces dramatic cardiac remodeling in WT but not in A2ARKO hypertensive mice. AMPK/PGC1α signaling-induced fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in brown adipocytes is required for A2AR-mediated inhibition of hypertensive cardiac remodeling. Recombinant FGF21 administration improves cardiac remodeling in iBAT-depleted hypertensive mice. More importantly, brown adipocyte-specific A2ARKO inhibits FGF21 production and accelerates cardiac damage in hypertension. Consistently, brown adipocyte-specific FGF21 knockout abolishes the effects of A2AR agonism in attenuating hypertensive cardiac remodeling. Our findings reveal a distinctive endocrine role of BAT in hypertensive cardiac remodeling via activating A2AR/FGF21 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Prokaryotic Argonaute (Ago) proteins were recently shown to target foreign genetic elements, thus making them a perfect model for studies of interference mechanisms. Here, we study interactions of Rhodobacter sphaeroides Ago (RsAgo) with guide RNA (gRNA) and fully complementary or imperfect target DNA (tDNA) using biochemical and structural approaches. We show that RsAgo can specifically recognize both the first nucleotide in gRNA and complementary nucleotide in tDNA, and both interactions contribute to nucleic acid binding. Non-canonical pairs and bulges on the target strand can be accommodated by RsAgo with minimal perturbation of the duplex but significantly reduce RsAgo affinity to tDNA. Surprisingly, mismatches between gRNA and tDNA induce dissociation of the guide-target duplex from RsAgo. Our results reveal plasticity in the ability of Ago proteins to accommodate helical imperfections, show how this might affect the efficiency of RNA silencing, and suggest a potential mechanism for guide release and Ago recycling.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical severity of Staphylococcus aureus respiratory infection correlates with alpha toxin (AT) expression. AT activates the NLRP3 inflammasome; deletion of Nlrp3, or AT neutralization, protects mice from lethal S. aureus pneumonia. We tested the hypothesis that this protection is not due to a reduction in inflammasome-dependent cytokines (IL-1β/IL-18) but increased bactericidal function of macrophages. In vivo, neutralization of AT or NLRP3 improved bacterial clearance and survival, while blocking IL-1β/IL-18 did not. Primary human monocytes were used in vitro to determine the mechanism through which NLRP3 alters bacterial killing. In cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting NLRP3 or infected with AT-null S. aureus, mitochondria co-localize with bacterial-containing phagosomes. Mitochondrial engagement activates caspase-1, a process dependent on complex II of the electron transport chain, near the phagosome, promoting its acidification. These data demonstrate a mechanism utilized by S. aureus to sequester itself from antimicrobial processes within the cell.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres regulate DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair activity at chromosome ends. How telomere macromolecular structure contributes to ATM regulation and its potential dissociation from control over non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-dependent telomere fusion is of central importance to telomere-dependent cell aging and tumor suppression. Using super-resolution microscopy, we identify that ATM activation at mammalian telomeres with reduced TRF2 or at human telomeres during mitotic arrest occurs specifically with a structural change from telomere loops (t-loops) to linearized telomeres. Additionally, we find the TRFH domain of TRF2 regulates t-loop formation while suppressing ATM activity. Notably, we demonstrate that ATM activation and telomere linearity occur separately from telomere fusion via NHEJ and that linear DDR-positive telomeres can remain resistant to fusion, even during an extended G1 arrest, when NHEJ is most active. Collectively, these results suggest t-loops act as conformational switches that specifically regulate ATM activation independent of telomere mechanisms to inhibit NHEJ.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) constitute an endogenous reservoir for neurons that could potentially be harnessed for regenerative therapies in disease contexts such as neurodegeneration. However, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), NSCs lose plasticity and thus possible regenerative capacity. We investigate how NSCs lose their plasticity in AD by using starPEG-heparin-based hydrogels to establish a reductionist 3D cell-instructive neuro-microenvironment that promotes the proliferative and neurogenic ability of primary and induced human NSCs. We find that administration of AD-associated Amyloid-β42 causes classical neuropathology and hampers NSC plasticity by inducing kynurenic acid (KYNA) production. Interleukin-4 restores NSC proliferative and neurogenic ability by suppressing the KYNA-producing enzyme Kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT2), which is upregulated in APP/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD and in postmortem human AD brains. Thus, our culture system enables a reductionist investigation of regulation of human NSC plasticity for the identification of potential therapeutic targets for intervention in AD.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA-mediated gene silencing is a fundamental mechanism in the regulation of gene expression. It remains unclear how the efficiency of RNA silencing could be influenced by RNA-binding proteins associated with the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Here we report that fused in sarcoma (FUS), an RNA-binding protein linked to neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), interacts with the core miRISC component AGO2 and is required for optimal microRNA-mediated gene silencing. FUS promotes gene silencing by binding to microRNA and mRNA targets, as illustrated by its action on miR-200c and its target ZEB1. A truncated mutant form of FUS that leads its carriers to an aggressive form of ALS, R495X, impairs microRNA-mediated gene silencing. The C. elegans homolog fust-1 also shares a conserved role in regulating the microRNA pathway. Collectively, our results suggest a role for FUS in regulating the activity of microRNA-mediated silencing.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication in the embryo of Xenopus laevis changes dramatically at the mid-blastula transition (MBT), with Y RNA-independent random initiation switching to Y RNA-dependent initiation at specific origins. Here, we identify xNuRD, an MTA2-containing assemblage of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex NuRD, as an essential factor in pre-MBT Xenopus embryos that overcomes a functional requirement for Y RNAs during DNA replication. Human NuRD complexes have a different subunit composition than xNuRD and do not support Y RNA-independent initiation of DNA replication. Blocking or immunodepletion of xNuRD inhibits DNA replication initiation in isolated nuclei in vitro and causes inhibition of DNA synthesis, developmental delay, and embryonic lethality in early embryos. xNuRD activity declines after the MBT, coinciding with dissociation of the complex and emergence of Y RNA-dependent initiation. Our data thus reveal an essential role for a NuRD complex as a DNA replication factor during early Xenopus development.

Abstract: Summary
Recent integrative epigenome analyses highlight the importance of functionally distinct chromatin states for accurate cell function. How these states are established and maintained is a matter of intense investigation. Here, we present evidence for DNA damage as an unexpected means to shape a protective chromatin environment at regions of recurrent replication stress (RS). Upon aberrant fork stalling, DNA damage signaling and concomitant H2AX phosphorylation coordinate the FACT-dependent deposition of macroH2A1.2, a histone variant that promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). MacroH2A1.2, in turn, facilitates the accumulation of the tumor suppressor and HR effector BRCA1 at replication forks to protect from RS-induced DNA damage. Consequently, replicating primary cells steadily accrue macroH2A1.2 at fragile regions, whereas macroH2A1.2 loss in these cells triggers DNA damage signaling-dependent senescence, a hallmark of RS. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that recurrent DNA damage contributes to the chromatin landscape to ensure the epigenomic integrity of dividing cells.

Abstract: Alternative models such as three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures represent a distinct milestone towards capturing the realities of cancer biology in vitro and reduce animal experimentation in the preclinical stage of drug discovery. Significant work remains to be done to understand how substrates used in in vitro alternatives influence cancer cells phenotype and drug efficacy responses, so that to accurately link such models to specific in vivo disease scenarios. Our study describes how the morphological, mechanical and biochemical properties of adenocarcinoma (A549) cells change in response to a 3D environment and varying substrates. Confocal Laser Scanning (LSCM), He-Ion (HIM) and Atomic Force (AFM) microscopies, supported by ELISA and Western blotting, were used. These techniques enabled us to evaluate the shape, cytoskeletal organization, roughness, stiffness and biochemical signatures of cells grown within soft 3D matrices (PuraMatrix™ and Matrigel™), and to compare them to those of cells cultured on two-dimensional glass substrates. Cell cultures are also characterized for their biological response to docetaxel, a taxane-type drug used in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Our results offer an advanced biophysical insight into the properties and potential application of 3D cultures of A549 cells as in vitro alternatives in lung cancer research.

Abstract: Summary
The peripheral protein quality control (QC) system removes non-native membrane proteins, including ΔF508-CFTR, the most common CFTR mutant in cystic fibrosis (CF), from the plasma membrane (PM) for lysosomal degradation by ubiquitination. It remains unclear how unfolded membrane proteins are recognized and targeted for ubiquitination and how they are removed from the apical PM. Using comprehensive siRNA screens, we identified RFFL, an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that directly and selectively recognizes unfolded ΔF508-CFTR through its disordered regions. RFFL retrieves the unfolded CFTR from the PM for lysosomal degradation by chaperone-independent K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. RFFL ablation enhanced the functional expression of cell-surface ΔF508-CFTR in the presence of folding corrector molecules, and this effect was further improved by inhibiting the Hsc70-dependent ubiquitination machinery. We propose that multiple peripheral QC mechanisms evolved to dispose of non-native PM proteins and to preserve cellular proteostasis, even at the cost of eliminating partially functional polypeptides.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescent labels offer the capability to follow conformational dynamics of membrane proteins, but signal detection in such recordings is inherently difficult to achieve in a cell membrane and lacks sufficient time resolution to follow physiologically relevant transitions. Here, we develop high-sensitivity patch-clamp fluorometry (hsPCF), a fluorescence-based approach that results in up to 10-fold increased signals and affords 50-fold faster fluorescence recordings than previous methods. The increased time resolution is paired with a very high versatility in terms of the choice of fluorescent dye, cell type, and protein of interest. We highlight this versatility by providing insight into the conformational dynamics of both ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels using fluorescent labels introduced in extracellular or transmembrane positions while changing either the extra- or intracellular solutions. Together, hsPCF will thus enable the future study of membrane-embedded proteins with sufficient temporal resolution to resolve conformational dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular signaling networks coordinate physiological processes in all multicellular organisms. Within networks, modules switch their function to control signaling activity in response to the cellular context. However, systematic approaches to map the interplay of such modules have been lacking. Here, we generated a context-dependent genetic interaction network of a metazoan's signaling pathway. Using Wnt signaling in Drosophila as a model, we measured >290,000 double perturbations of the pathway in a baseline state, after activation by Wnt ligand or after loss of the tumor suppressor APC. We found that genetic interactions within the Wnt network globally rewired after pathway activation. We derived between-state networks that showed how genes changed their function between state-specific networks. This related pathway inhibitors across states and identified genes required for pathway activation. For instance, we predicted and confirmed the ER-resident protein Catsup to be required for ligand-mediated Wnt signaling activation. Together, state-dependent and between-state genetic interaction networks identify responsive functional modules that control cellular pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise has beneficial effects on metabolism and on tissues. The exercise-induced muscle factor β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) plays a critical role in the browning of white fat and in insulin resistance. Here we show another function for BAIBA, that of a bone-protective factor that prevents osteocyte cell death induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). l-BAIBA was as or more protective than estrogen or N-acetyl cysteine, signaling through the Mas-Related G Protein-Coupled Receptor Type D (MRGPRD) to prevent the breakdown of mitochondria due to ROS. BAIBA supplied in drinking water prevented bone loss and loss of muscle function in the murine hindlimb unloading model, a model of osteocyte apoptosis. The protective effect of BAIBA was lost with age, not due to loss of the muscle capacity to produce BAIBA but likely to reduced Mrgprd expression with aging. This has implications for understanding the attenuated effect of exercise on bone with aging.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent mutations in chromatin modifiers are specifically prevalent in adolescent or adult patients with Sonic hedgehog-associated medulloblastoma (SHH MB). Here, we report that mutations in the acetyltransferase CREBBP have opposing effects during the development of the cerebellum, the primary site of origin of SHH MB. Our data reveal that loss of Crebbp in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) during embryonic development of mice compromises GNP development, in part by downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). Interestingly, concomitant cerebellar hypoplasia was also observed in patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a congenital disorder caused by germline mutations of CREBBP. By contrast, loss of Crebbp in GNPs during postnatal development synergizes with oncogenic activation of SHH signaling to drive MB growth, thereby explaining the enrichment of somatic CREBBP mutations in SHH MB of adult patients. Together, our data provide insights into time-sensitive consequences of CREBBP mutations and corresponding associations with human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Developmentally regulated accessory subunits dictate PRC2 function. Here, we report the crystal structures of a 120 kDa heterotetrameric complex consisting of Suz12, Rbbp4, Jarid2, and Aebp2 fragments that is minimally active in nucleosome binding and of an inactive binary complex of Suz12 and Rbbp4. Suz12 contains two unique structural platforms that define distinct classes of PRC2 holo complexes for chromatin binding. Aebp2 and Phf19 compete for binding of a non-canonical C2 domain of Suz12; Jarid2 and EPOP occupy an overlapped Suz12 surface required for chromatin association of PRC2. Suz12 and Aebp2 progressively block histone H3K4 binding to Rbbp4, suggesting that Rbbp4 may not be directly involved in PRC2 inhibition by the active H3K4me3 histone mark. Nucleosome binding enabled by Jarid2 and Aebp2 is in part accounted for by the structures, which also reveal that disruption of the Jarid2-Suz12 interaction may underlie the disease mechanism of an oncogenic chromosomal translocation of Suz12.
