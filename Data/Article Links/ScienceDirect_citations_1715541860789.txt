Abstract: To effectively mitigate oxygen induced degradation of electronic properties in hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) the microscopic origins of the associated defects must be determined. This work elucidates the origin of a 0.7eV photoluminescence (PL) band observed in thermally annealed, oxygen contaminated nc-Si:H. Raman and PL spectroscopy data demonstrate the deep defects responsible for the 0.7eV PL reside in the crystalline phase. The electronic levels enabling the emission exist 0.4eV below the conduction band edge, or 0.4eV above the valence band edge, or both, with transitions into or out of extended states as opposed to band tail recombination. The defect formation energy is 0.6eV, which suggests that the formation involves a local reconfiguration of oxygen and hydrogen as opposed to bulk diffusion. Hydrogen plays multiple roles in the microstructural evolution and electronic activity of these centers. TEM micrographs show dislocations in the nanocrystalline regions, which suggests that oxygen gettering occurs. It seems in the absence of hydrogen dislocations in Si nanocrystals scavenge oxygen impurities from grain boundaries to become optically active, enabling emission at 0.7eV.

Abstract: Activation of the insulin growth factor receptor-1 signaling pathways has been largely related to the aging process. Amadori products are produced in pathological conditions such as diabetes and aging, and are potentially involved in diabetic nephropathy or age-associated decline of renal function. We hypothesize that Amadori products induce senescence in primary human mesangial cells through the activation of IGF-1 receptor and investigate, in the present work, the intracellular mechanism involved after this activation. We treated cultured human mesangial cells with glycated albumin, one of the most abundant Amadori product, and senescence was assessed by determining the senescence associated β-galactosidase activity and the expression of the cell cycle regulators p53 and p21. We demonstrated that prolonged exposition (more than 24h) to glycated albumin induced senescence and, in parallel, incremented the release of IGF-1 and the activation of the IGF-1 receptor. Inhibition of the IGF-1 activation prevented the GA induced senescence. Activation of IGF-1R, after GA addition, promoted a reduction in the catalase content through the constitutive activation of Ras and erk1/2 proteins which were, in turn, responsible of the observed GA-induced senescence. In conclusion, we propose that the Amadori product, glycated albumin, promotes premature cell senescence in mesangial cells through the activation of the IGF-1 receptor and the subsequent reduction in the antioxidant enzyme catalase.

Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces a state of oxidative stress more pronounced than that observed in many other inflammatory diseases. Here, we propose a temporal sequence of events in the HCV-infected cell whereby the primary alteration consists of a release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by uptake into mitochondria. This ensues successive mitochondrial dysfunction leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species and a progressive metabolic adaptive response. Evidence is provided for a positive feed-back mechanism between alterations of calcium and redox homeostasis. This likely involves deregulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition and induces progressive dysfunction of cellular bioenergetics. Pathogenetic implications of the model and new opportunities for therapeutic intervention are discussed. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

Abstract: Numerous studies indicate that an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) significantly affects white adipose tissue biology and leads to an inflammatory profile and insulin resistance, which could contribute to obesity-associated diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Mitochondria play a key role in adipose tissue energy metabolism and constitute the main source of cellular ROS such as H2O2. Polyphenols constitute the most abundant antioxidants provided by the human diet. Indeed, they are widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and some plant-derived beverages such as coffee and tea. Thus, the biological effects of dietary polyphenols that may increase the antioxidant capacity of the body against obesity-induced oxidative stress are of high interest. Here, we studied the capacity of polyphenols to modulate the impact of oxidative stress on the mitochondria of preadipocytes, which are important cells governing the adipose tissue development for energy homeostasis. Whereas H2O2 treatment induces a proliferation arrest associated with an increase in mitochondrial content in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, preconditioning with some major dietary polyphenols totally or partially protects the cells against oxidative stress consequences. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

Cellular steatosis in ethanol oxidizing-HepG2 cells is partially controlled by the transcription factor, early growth response-1,

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) regulates ethanol-induced fatty liver. However, the mechanism(s) through which ethanol oxidation controls Egr-1 is unknown. Here, using recombinant hepatoma (HepG2; VL-17A) cells that metabolize ethanol, we show that alcohol dehydrogenase catalysis of ethanol oxidation and subsequent acetaldehyde production controls Egr-1 expression. Further, the induction of Egr-1 enhances expression of other steatosis-related genes, resulting in triglyceride accumulation. Ethanol exposure increased Egr-1 promoter activity, messenger RNA and Egr-1 protein levels in VL-17A cells. Elevated Egr-1 protein was sustained by an ethanol-induced decrease in proteasome activity, thereby stabilizing the Egr-1 protein. Egr-1 induction depended on ethanol oxidation, as it was prevented when ethanol oxidation was blocked. Ethanol exposure induced Egr-1 and triglyceride accumulation only in alcohol dehydrogenase-expressing cells that produced acetaldehyde. Such induction did not occur in parental, non-metabolizing HepG2 cells or in cells that express only cytochrome P450 2E1. However, direct exposure of HepG2 cells to acetaldehyde induced both Egr-1 protein and triglycerides. Egr-1 over-expression elevated triglyceride levels, which were augmented by ethanol exposure. However, these triglyceride levels did not exceed those in ethanol-exposed cells that had normal Egr-1 expression. Conversely, Egr-1 knockdown by siRNA only partially blocked ethanol-induced triglyceride accumulation and was associated not only with lower Egr-1 expression but also attenuation of SREBP1c and TNF-α mRNAs. Double knockdown of both Egr-1 and SREBP-1c abolished ethanol-elicited steatosis. Collectively, our findings provide important new insights into the temporal regulation by ethanol oxidation of Egr-1 and cellular steatosis.

Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous gaseous transmitter that exerts antiproliferative effects in many cell types, but effects of CO on the translational machinery are not described. We examined the effects of the carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) on critical steps in translational signaling and global protein synthesis in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), the most prominent collagen-producing cells in the pancreas, whose activation is associated with pancreatic fibrosis. PSCs were isolated from rat pancreatic tissue and incubated with CORM-2. CORM-2 prevented the decrease in the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) caused by serum. By contrast, the activation dependent phosphorylation of initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) was inhibited by CORM-2 treatment. The phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) were not affected by CORM-2 treatment. In consequence, CORM-2 mediated eEF2 phosphorylation and inactivation of 4E-BP1 suppressed global protein synthesis. These observations were associated with inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) signaling and increased intracellular calcium and cAMP levels. The CORM-2 mediated inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression, a subsequent decline in the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) and cell growth arrest at the G0/G1 phase checkpoint of the cell cycle. Our results suggest the therapeutic application of CO releasing molecules such as CORM-2 for the treatment of fibrosis, inflammation, cancer, or other pathologic states associated with excessive protein synthesis or hyperproliferation. However, prolonged exogenous application of CO might also have negative effects on cellular protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Light-induced plating (LIP) techniques, which are self-aligned and are used in the fabrication of well-shaped metal grids, have been widely studied and used in solar cells, particularly in laser-doped selective emitter (LDSE) ones. However, the application of LIP techniques in standard acidic-textured multi-crystalline silicon wafers with SiNx-coated surfaces can be challenging because of the presence of some unwanted metals on the SiNx surface during the plating process. This phenomenon is called over-plating, a problem in industrial LDSE multi-crystalline Si solar cell manufacturing that this paper aims to eliminate without the addition of any new process steps. The feasibility of changing the texturing process as well as the pretreatment before plating and the deposition of SiNx to reduce over-plating was investigated. The effects of over-plating on solar cell performance were also investigated to determine the mechanism of performance degradation. The cells reached a maximum efficiency of 17.2% and an average efficiency of 17.1% on large-area, commercial-grade, p-type multi-crystalline Si substrates when the over-plating problem was eliminated.

Abstract: More and more mutations are found in the mitochondrial DNA of various patients but ascertaining their pathogenesis is often difficult. Due to the conservation of mitochondrial function from yeast to humans, the unique ability of yeast to survive without production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, and the amenability of the yeast mitochondrial genome to site-directed mutagenesis, yeast is an excellent model for investigating the consequences of specific human mtDNA mutations. Here we report the construction of a yeast model of a point mutation (T8851C) in the mitochondrially-encoded subunit a/6 of the ATP synthase that has been associated with bilateral striatal lesions, a group of rare human neurological disorders characterized by symmetric degeneration of the corpus striatum. The biochemical consequences of this mutation are unknown. The T8851C yeast displayed a very slow growth phenotype on non-fermentable carbon sources, both at 28°C (the optimal temperature for yeast growth) and at 36°C. Mitochondria from T8851C yeast grown in galactose at 28°C showed a 60% deficit in ATP production. When grown at 36°C the rate of ATP synthesis was below 5% that of the wild-type, indicating that heat renders the mutation much more deleterious. At both growth temperatures, the mutant F1Fo complex was correctly assembled but had only very weak ATPase activity (about 10% that of the control), both in mitochondria and after purification. These findings indicate that a block in the proton-translocating domain of the ATP synthase is the primary cause of the neurological disorder in the patients carrying the T8851C mutation.

Abstract: Normal human skin relies on melanocytes to provide photoprotection and thermoregulation by producing melanin. The growth and behavior of melanocytes are controlled by many factors. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is expressed in both immune and non-immune cells and participates in the adjustment of multitude cellular functions. Nonetheless, the regulative roles of IL-18 in melanogenesis and growth of melanocytes have not been explored. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of IL-18 on melanocytes and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We proved that IL-18 increased the tyrosinase activity and melanin content in normal human foreskin-derived epidermal melanocytes (NHEM). Treatment with IL-18 (20ng/ml) enhanced the expression of c-Kit, microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its downstream tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1), and TRP-2. In addition, IL-18 induced NHEM migration at concentration of 20ng/ml. These results indicated a promotive action of IL-18 on melanogenesis in NHEM. Our data revealed that IL-18 stimulated ERK1/2 and NF-κB activation, improved p-Akt, p70 S6K and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 levels, and deactivated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in NHEM. Besides, IL-18 increased level of PTEN phosphorylation to protect NHEM from damage induced by H2O2. These results in vitro showed the accommodation of IL-18 in melanocytes growth. Therefore, we suggested an important regulating action of IL-18 to melanogenesis and cell growth ability of skin melanocytes.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of anode buffer layers (ABLs) on the performances of multi-layer heterojunction solar cells with thienylenevinylene–triphenylamine with peripheral dicyanovinylene groups (TDCV–TPA) as donor material and fullerene C60 as acceptor. The deposition of a CuI layer between the ITO anode and the electron donor significantly improves the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) but reduces the open-circuit voltage (Voc). On the other hand, a MoO3 buffer layer increases the Voc but leads to limited Jsc and FF values, thus reducing power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this context, we show that the use of a hybrid anode buffer layer MoO3/CuI leads to a considerable improvement of the cells performances and a PCE of 2.50% has been achieved. These results are discussed on the basis of the dual function of MoO3 and CuI. While both of them reduce the hole injection barrier, CuI improves the conductivity of the organic film through an improvement of molecular order while MoO3 prevents leakage current through the diode. Finally the results of a cursory study of the ageing process provide further support to this interpretation of the effects of the various buffer layers.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the potential of using nickel oxide (NiO)-lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON) composite as an anode electrode in electrochromic devices and evaluated the effect of Li+ insertion (or extraction) kinetics and diffusion of Li+. NiO–LiPON composite thin films were fabricated using the RF magnetron co-sputtering method. Here, we observed, for the first time, the bimodal colored states of the NiO–LiPON composite. This was caused by reacting both Ni metal and LiO under extremely cathodic condition, which enhanced the electrochromic properties – electrochromic response time and optical modulations – of the device. We also found that the NiO–LiPON composite thin films displayed long term stability.

Abstract: Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases (PIP4Ks) phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P) to generate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; their most likely function is the regulation of the levels of PI5P, a putative signalling intermediate. There are three mammalian PIP4Ks isoforms (α, β and γ), but their physiological roles remain poorly understood. In the present study, we identified the zebrafish orthologue (zPIP4Kα) of the high-activity human PIP4K α isoform and analyzed its role in embryonic development. RT-PCR analysis and whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments showed that zPIP4Kα is maternally expressed. At later embryonic stages, high PIP4Kα expression was detected in the head and the pectoral fins. Knockdown of zPIP4Kα by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides led to severe morphological abnormalities, including midbody winding defects at 48hpf. The abnormal phenotype could be rescued, at least in large part, by injection of human PIP4Kα mRNA. Our results reveal a key role for PIP4Kα and its activity in vertebrate tissue homeostasis and organ development.

Abstract: A pyramid and nanopillar micro-nano surface texture of silicon wafer, which has pyramid arrays about 4–8μm with different nanopillars of average diameter from 100 to 500nm and height from 500nm to 1.5μm, is fabricated by Cesium Chloride (CsCl) self-assembly lithography and dry etching for solar cell. This micro-nano surface texture with 100 and 200nm average diameter has very good antireflection with reflectance below 5% for the wavelength ranging from 400 to 1000nm and much lower than that of single pyramid or nanopillar arrays with the same average diameter. The reflected distribution of this micro-nano structure illuminated with white parallel light at incidence angle of 45° is tested by a irradiatometer at the reflected angle from 10 to 80 degree and shows a total diffuse and very low reflection at different reflected angles, which benefits from both the advantages of nanopillar and pyramid structure. The solar cell with this micro-nano texture has been finished with thermal diffusion of Phosphorus for P–N junction and printing silver plasma for front electrode poles, and its photovoltaic conversion efficiency is about 7.05% which is higher than that of solar cell only with the planar, single pyramid or nanopillar and made with the same fabricating process.

Abstract: Bright yellow coloration and enhanced NIR reflectance of monoclinic bismuth vanadate are obtained by the substitution of Ta/P into the vanadium sites of BiVO4. Pentavalent metal ion substitution in bismuth vanadate blue shifted the absorption edge leading to bright yellow coloration and the color properties are comparable to that of commercially used praseodymium yellow. Lattice distortion and reduced crystallite size imposed by pentavalent metal ion substitution are responsible for the special optical properties. The synthesized pigments with improved yellow coloration exhibits good NIR reflectance making them potential candidate for cool colorants to reduce the heat build-up.

Abstract: Methylglyoxal is one of the most powerful glycating agents of proteins and other important cellular components and has been shown to be toxic to cultured cells. Methylglyoxal cytotoxicity appears to occur through cell-cycle arrest but, more often, through induction of apoptosis. In this study we examined whether, and through which molecular mechanism, methylglyoxal affects the growth of poorly aggressive LNCaP and invasive PC3 human prostate cancer cells, where its role has not been exhaustively investigated yet. We demonstrated that methylglyoxal is cytotoxic on LNCaP and PC3 and that such cytotoxicity occurs not via cell proliferation but apoptosis control. Moreover, we demonstrated that methylglyoxal cytotoxicity, potentiated by the silencing of its major scavenging enzyme Glyoxalase I, occurred via different apoptotic responses in LNCaP and PC3 cells that also showed a different susceptibility to this metabolite. Finally, we showed that the observed methylglyoxal apoptogenic role involved different molecular pathways, specifically mediated by methylglyoxal or methylglyoxal-derived argpyrimidine intracellular accumulation and NF-kB signaling-pathway. In particular, in LNCaP cells, methylglyoxal, through the accumulation of argpyrimidine, desensitized the key cell survival NF-kB signaling pathway, which was consistent with the modulation of NF-kB-regulated genes, triggering a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The results suggest that this physiological compound merits investigation as a potential chemo-preventive/-therapeutic agent, in differently aggressive prostate cancers.

Abstract: A CdTe/CdS heterostructure was fabricated on Fluorine Tin Oxide glass to produce thin-film photovoltaic devices. A CdCl2 layer was deposited onto the CdTe absorber layer and the subsequent annealing of the stack was performed in a He atmosphere. The influence of the CdCl2-activation step on the interfaces was investigated by monitoring the phase transition of CdCl2-heat-treated CdTe specimens during temperature ramp annealing via in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy depth profiling data confirmed the interdiffusion between the CdTe and CdS layers through observation of the binding energy shifts and atomic ratio. The experimental results reveal that a compressive force, which is due to the formation of CdTeCdCl2 eutectic liquid phases between grains, which cause the capillary action of such liquid phases, seems to introduce a compressive strain in the plane of the film that facilitates the recrystallization process.

Abstract: We report a development of a highly transparent conductive film (TCF) which is the first embedded metal grid of fine lines on a flexible substrate. The TCF reveals excellent electrical and optical performance as transparent conductive film with an extremely high σDC/σOP value of 237 due to 80.35% transmittance and 6.85Ω/□ sheet resistance. Furthermore, the extremely high performance is realized with new features of the TCFs: roll-to-roll printability on flexible substrates, thermal imprinting of channels at 10μm widths, water-based nano-silver paste to fill the narrow channels, and doctor blade as a facile method to fill the paste into the channels. The TCF electrode is implemented to fabrication of an organic solar cell (OSC) which shows a power conversion efficiency of 1.40%. This is non-optimized yet but approaching that of an ITO-based OSC (1.70%). Thus, we demonstrate a printable TCF to replace the ITO films toward low-cost large area roll-to-roll fabrication of organic solar cells.

Abstract: Hepatitis B virus core protein can regulate viral replication and host gene expression. However, it is unclear whether and how hepatitis B virus core protein regulates hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation. Induction of hepatitis B virus core protein over-expression significantly enhanced the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, while knockdown of hepatitis B virus core protein expression inhibited the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Altered hepatitis B virus core protein expression significantly changed the growth of implanted hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo. Microarray analysis indicated that hepatitis B virus core protein up-regulated human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression, which was further validated by over-expression and knockdown assays in vitro. Furthermore, knockdown of human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression mitigated the hepatitis B virus core protein-enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and clone formation in vitro. Luciferase assays indicated that hepatitis B virus core protein enhanced the promoter activity of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, which was dependent on the binding of c-Ets2 to the promoter region between −192 and −187. In addition, hepatitis B virus core protein enhanced human telomerase reverse transcriptase transcription in HepG2 cells, but not in the c-Ets2-silencing HepG2 cells. Moreover, hepatitis B virus core protein promoted c-Ets2 nuclear translocation. Finally, significantly higher levels of human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression and nuclear c-Ets2 accumulation were detected in hepatitis B virus core protein-positive hepatocellular carcinoma samples. Our findings demonstrate that hepatitis B virus core protein promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation by up-regulating the c-Ets2-dependent expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase.

Abstract: Bax-induced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is considered as one of the key control switches of apoptosis. MOMP requires Bax relocation to and insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane to oligomerize and form pores allowing the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c. Even if these essential steps are now well-defined, it is necessary to better understand the molecular changes underlying the switch between inactive Bax and active (pore-forming) Bax. One of the ongoing issues is to determine whether Bax mitochondrial translocation is a critical step in the control of Bax activation or if this control is carried by latter regulatory steps. In this focus article we discuss recent data suggesting that although Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL block the MOMP, they can also regulate the mitochondrial Bax content. A new model in which Bax inhibition by Bcl-xL occurs at the immediate proximity of the outer mitochondrial membrane is also discussed.

Abstract: Mitochondria are membrane bound organelles that provide cellular energy in form of ATP. In addition to ATP synthesis mitochondria are key regulators of calcium homeostasis, free radical production, steroid synthesis and apoptosis, each of these factors could also be associated with essential mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies revealed that changes in mitochondria membrane fluidity might have a direct impact on membrane-based processes such as fission-associated morphogenic changes, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore or oxidative phosphorylation at the complexes of the electron transport chain. We investigated synaptosomal plasma and mitochondrial membranes isolated from brains of mouse models for ageing, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Membrane properties are disease specifically altered, identifying mitochondrial membranes as targets for possible therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.

Burst of succinate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in concert with the expression of genes coding for respiratory chain proteins underlies short-term beneficial physiological stress in mitochondria,

Abstract: Conditions for the realization in rats of moderate physiological stress (PHS) (30–120min) were selected, which preferentially increase adaptive restorative processes without adverse responses typical of harmful stress (HST). The succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH) activity and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria were measured in lymphocytes by the cytobiochemical method, which detects the regulation of mitochondria in the organism with high sensitivity. These mitochondrial markers undergo an initial 10–20-fold burst of activity followed by a decrease to a level exceeding the quiescent state 2–3-fold by 120min of PHS. By 30–60min, the rise in SDH activity was greater than in KDH activity, while the activity of KDH prevailed over that of SDH by 120min. The attenuation of SDH hyperactivity during PHS occurs by a mechanism other than oxaloacetate inhibition developed under HST. The dynamics of SDH and KDH activity corresponds to the known physiological replacement of adrenergic regulation by cholinergic during PHS, which is confirmed here by mitochondrial markers because their activity reflects these two types of nerve regulation, respectively. The domination of cholinergic regulation provides the overrestoration of expenditures for activity. In essence, this phenomenon corresponds to the training of the organism. It was first revealed in mitochondria after a single short-time stress episode. The burst of ROS formation was congruous with changes in SDH and KDH activity, as well as in ucp2 and cox3 expression, while the activity of SDH was inversely dependent on the expression of the gene of its catalytic subunit in the spleen. As the SDH activity enhanced, the expression of the succinate receptor decreased with subsequent dramatic rise when the activity was becoming lower.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) modules undergo accelerated aging tests as part of the certification procedure in order to confirm that they are not susceptible to the most common failure mechanisms that would strongly reduce their lifetime in the field. Though not yet part of the standard test sequence, it is well known that silicon camera based electroluminescence (EL) imaging would be a good addition to the test sequence as it enables the identification of defects in PV modules such as micro-cracks and poor electrical contact that will limit the lifetime of the module in the field, but do not necessarily result in a power reduction of more than 5% that would have them fail the certification tests. After IEC tests, we observe two distinct types of dark areas in the EL images of silicon wafer based PV modules, irregularly shaped regions which are the result of cracks in the silicon wafers, and regular rectangular shaped areas which we postulate are due to broken front grid fingers. In order to identify the mechanism responsible for the dark rectangular regions in the EL images of silicon wafer based PV modules, we investigate a soldered solar cell which exhibits similar rectangular dark areas in its EL image. SEM microscopy reveals that the dark areas in this cell are due to broken fingers caused by contraction of the tin during the soldering process. We hypothesise that a similar mechanism is responsible for the dark rectangular areas seen in the EL images of silicon wafer based PV modules after the accelerated aging tests.

Abstract: Infectious diseases such as those caused by virus, account for a vast proportion of deaths worldwide. Re-emerging aspects of host–virus interactions in recent literature include the vital role played by host metabolism on viral replication and the pro-active participation of mitochondria in this process. Different viruses use distinctive strategies to modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and enhance viral replication. As a result, energy yielding metabolic pathways are programmed to provide both energy and biosynthetic resources to drive viral protein synthesis and produce infectious particles. Therefore, metabolic antagonists may prove important not only to outline efficient therapy strategies but also to shed light on the pathogenesis of viral infections. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

Abstract: Photovoltaic performances of polymer bulk-heterojunction solar cells (PSCs) with various sized (20, 35, 50, and 75nm) Au nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates are investigated in detail, wherein poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) blend serves as active layer and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as anode buffer layer on ITO. The optical and electrical properties of these devices incorporated with Au NPs with different space distributions in the interface of PEDOT:PSS buffer layer and P3HT:PCBM active layer are investigated. We find that, the optical property is improved as the Au NPs are large enough to penetrate into the active layer, while the performance of PSCs with small Au NPs can only benefit from the improved hole collection efficiency. Meanwhile, the exciton dissociation efficiency reduces remarkably as increasing the size of Au NPs. Finally, we demonstrated a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement of ∼23% in the PSCs by incorporating 35nm Au NPs.

Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon oxynitride (a-SiOxNy:H) films, which are deposited by the plasma decomposition of silane and nitrous oxide at low temperatures (Tdep<300°C), are investigated in order to evaluate the potential of these films for photovoltaic applications. In this work both, intrinsic and doped a-SiOxNy:H films are investigated in terms of their electrical, optical and structural properties using Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) and secondary-ion mass-spectroscopy (SIMS), as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photo-conductance decay (PCD), spectral ellipsometry and temperature-dependent conductivity measurements. The plasma deposition parameters are optimized in terms of effective minority carrier lifetime, dark conductivity and low absorbance (i.e. high optical band gap). The optical band gap of the a-SiOxNy:H films can be widened up to 2.2eV compared to a-Si:H due to the incorporation of oxygen and nitrogen into the amorphous network. Not only the optical band gap but also the passivation quality and the dark conductivity of the films are well correlated with the oxygen and nitrogen concentration, which are monitored by means of SIMS measurements. When applying an a-SiOxNy:H film with an optical band gap of 2.0eV, a very high effective minority carrier lifetime of 2.5ms is measured. In case of doped films, conductivities up to σdark=4.5×10−3S/cm for the n-type doping and σdark=3.9×10−4S/cm for the p-type doping are achieved. Combining the intrinsic and doped a-SiOxNy:H films to heteroemitter stacks on a crystalline Si base, a very high implied open circuit voltage of up to 733mV is demonstrated. FTIR and HRTEM measurements reveal a homogenous distribution of Si–Si and Si–O–Si bonds in the a-SiOxNy:H films.

Abstract: Arginase is an enzyme involved in the last step of the urea cycle, where it catalyses the hydrolysis of l-arginine to generate l-ornithine and urea. Compared to the well-characterised arginases from animals, yeast and other bacteria, Helicobacter pylori arginase, or RocF, is unique in at least three aspects. Firstly, it has been identified as an important factor in evasion of the host's immune system and thus contributes to persistent infection by the bacterium. Secondly, the optimal catalytic conditions of RocF are different from those of other arginases. Finally, sequence alignment indicates that RocF possesses considerable differences at its N- and C-terminal from other arginases and harbours an insertion of 13 residues in the middle of the sequence. To better understand these unique biochemical and enzymatic properties, we therefore have embarked on determining the structure of RocF. In this study, the crystal structure of RocF was solved with the molecular replacement method. Based on the structure and systematic mutagenesis studies, we confirmed that the inserted residues form a helix that was not observed in other arginases and was able to raise the arginase activity by 30% probably by change the conformation of the substrate binding pocket. Six residues were involved in Mn2+ binding, all of which were essential for arginase activity. The C-terminal motif is not sufficient in establishing the oligomeric state of RocF, and no disulphide bonds were observed in RocF.

Abstract: Respiratory chain complex I (CI) dysfunctions have been recognized as one of the most frequent causes of mitochondrial neuro-muscular disorders. Moreover, latest reports reveal that CI impairment is a major contributing factor in many other pathological processes, including cancer. In fact, energy depletion, oxidative stress and metabolites unbalance are frequently associated with CI functional and structural alterations. The occurrence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations is a shared feature in neuro-muscular diseases and cancer; however, the two diverging phenotypes arise depending on the mutation type (disassembling versus non-disassembling mutations), the mutant load and the cytotype. In this review, we unify our knowledge on CI impairment caused by mutations in structural CI genes and assembly chaperones, both in mitochondrial disorders and cancer, stratifying such mutations based on their functional versus structural effects. We summarize shared and specific metabolic consequences of CI dysfunction in these pathologies, which allow us to draw two parallel roads that lead to different clinical outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate the properties of P3 isolation lines in a-Si:H/μc-Si:H solar modules, prepared with a nano-second pulsed UV laser incident from the film side of the solar module. For the electrical characterization of the P3 lines we developed a method which allows us to distinguish between leakage currents directly across the P3 line, leakage currents along the laser line side walls and to monitor changes in conductivity of the TCO underneath the line. We applied the developed characterization method to a series of P3 lines where we systematically varied the used laser parameters. In addition we analyzed selected P3 lines using Scanning Electron Microscopy. From the systematic variation we find that a high leakage current directly across the P3 lines is observed when the back contact is not fully removed. The best P3 lines have the back contact fully removed but an incomplete removal of the silicon in the line. When the silicon layer stack is fully removed in the P3 line we observe an increase in leakage current along the side walls of the laser lines. The best P3 laser line we obtained exhibits a very low leakage current density of only 1.5μAcm−1 at 1V.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel fire-through contact (FTC) approach for the formation of local rear contacts for rear surface passivated silicon solar cells. The FTC approach aims at an easy integration of rear surface passivation into typical production lines. Besides rear surface passivation, no new technology is required as FTC only relies on common printing equipment. In this work, different FTC contact geometries and printing approaches are investigated using lifetime and resistance measurements. A PC1D model is implemented to allow for a comparison of different FTC configurations on cell level. Finally, the integration of the FTC approach into metal wrap through solar cells is presented.

Abstract: Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a promising earth-abundant semiconductor for photovoltaic applications. Developing an understanding of the p-type conduction mechanism is vital to optimize the material. We have used a reactive magnetron sputtering system to fabricate Cu2O thin films. The bandgap, refractive index, mobility, density of hole, and electrical conductivity in the films have also been investigated. Our work shows that the films fabricated under nitrogen-rich condition exhibit wide bandgaps and low electrical conductivities while the films deposited under oxygen-rich condition have narrow bandgaps and high electrical conductivities. The results from the density functional theory are introduced to explain the gas dependence of the bandgap. A developed theoretical model based on Fermi-Dirac statistics shows that the high electrical conductivities originate from the acceptor levels located below Feimi level in the film.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the effects of a wet chemical etch-back process and the porous Si that is formed during the etch-back process on the optical and electrical performances of a selective emitter solar cell. In this paper, we assert that the sheet resistance of the emitter after the etch-back process could be controlled by monitoring the reflectivity of the porous Si at 500nm. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs of the porous Si reveal that the thickness of the porous Si is not entirely homogenous, gradually decreasing from the top of the pyramid to the valley. The etch-back process results in pyramid morphology variations that increase the reflectivity of the texture. After removing the porous Si, the minority carrier lifetime of the emitter increases significantly. Because of this effect, the conversion efficiency of the SE solar cell is 0.27% higher than that of the regular homogenous emitter solar cells. Although this approach increases the texture reflectivity, the etch-back process greatly improves the internal quantum efficiency in the short wavelength range, which in turn increases the short-circuit current density by a large amount. The calculated Jsc shows that the peak gain of the short-circuit current density occurs at approximately 400nm.

Abstract: The circulating levels of heat shock proteins (HSP) are increased in cardiovascular diseases; however, the implication of this for the fibrotic process typical of such diseases remains unclear. HSP70 can interact with the vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), the major producer of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, through the Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4). The transforming growth factor type-β1 (TGF-β1) is a well known vascular pro-fibrotic cytokine that is regulated in part by AP-1-dependent transcriptional mechanisms. We hypothesized that extracellular HSP70 could interact with SMCs, inducing TGF-β1 synthesis and subsequent changes in the vascular ECM. We demonstrate that extracellular HSP70 binds to human aorta SMC TLR4, which up-regulates the AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity of the TGF-β1 promoter. This is achieved through the mitogen activated protein kinases JNK and ERK, as demonstrated by the use of specific blockers and the knockdown of TLR4 with specific small interfering RNAs. The TGF-β1 upregulation increase the expression of the ECM proteins type I collagen and fibronectin. This novel observation may elucidate the mechanisms by which HSP70 contributes in the inflammation and fibrosis present in atherosclerosis and other fibrosis-related diseases.

Abstract: A series of high-chain fatty acid esters of 1-octadecanol (stearyl alcohol) was synthesized with even carbon number fatty acids between C12 and C20 under vacuum and in the absence of catalyst. Ester syntheses were controlled via Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and thermo-physical analyses of the products. These esters were particularly investigated in terms of their thermo-physical properties to be further used as Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in thermal energy storage. Purity, phase change temperature, enthalpy, specific heat (Cp), thermal decomposition and reliability after 1000 thermal cycles were presented with necessary statistical data. The DSC analyses indicated that the melting temperatures of the high-chain fatty acid esters of stearyl alcohol were between 42°C and 65°C with phase change enthalpies above 200kJ/kg. The results showed that these materials were favorable for low temperature heat transfer applications with their advantageous thermal properties and reliabilities. In addition to the presented novel PCMs, the influence of different higher alcohol and fatty acid combinations on thermal properties of the higher esters' homologous series was also discussed in detail together with the outcomes of the other published researches. The developed empirical correlations provided accurate estimation of phase change temperature and enthalpy values of high-chain fatty acid esters of higher alcohols without any instrumental analyses.

Abstract: ZnO nanostructured films including nano-ridge and nanorod morphologies were used as electron acceptors/transporters and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as light absorber and electron donor in organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells. Bilayer solar cells with ZnO nano-ridges and ordered heterojunction solar cells with ZnO nanorods were each fabricated and characterized. ZnO nanorod/P3HT ordered heterojunction devices exhibited higher efficiency (0.31%) than the bilayer cells (0.094%) because the photocurrent was increased, attributed to the larger P3HT/ZnO interface area. Surface potential (SP) of P3HT/ZnO nano-ridges and P3HT/ZnO nanorods was studied by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The SP difference between P3HT and ZnO nano-ridges was ∼0.10V in the dark, but increased to ∼0.25V under illumination. In the ZnO nanorod/P3HT films, ZnO nanorods showed lower SP with darker color, while P3HT exhibited higher SP with lighter color. In both nano-ridge/P3HT and nanorod/P3HT films, the SP difference demonstrated that electron transfer is energetically favorable from P3HT to ZnO.

Abstract: The performance of poly(3-hexyltheopene):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester or P3HT:PCBM based organic solar cell (OSC) devices can be improved by adding an electron extraction layer of a wide band gap semiconducting material such as ZnO or TiO2 that facilitates the electron transport from the photo-active layer (P3HT:PCBM blend) to the top metal electrode (e.g. Al) and, at the same time, blocks holes from reaching the top electrode. Other factors that determine performance of the OSC devices include morphology, thickness and donor–acceptor ratio. In this study we investigated the effects of concentration and particle morphology (nanoparticle versus nanoflake) of ZnO electron extraction layer on the performance of the OSC devices with configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ ZnO/Al. The concentration of ZnO nanoparticle or nanoflake solutions was varied from 0.5 to 20mg/ml. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.08% was recorded from devices incorporating ZnO nanoflake electron extraction layer, whereas PCE of 2.37% was recorded from devices with ZnO nanoparticles as the electron extraction layer. The maximum PCE was obtained from a concentration of 0.5mg/ml ZnO for both devices. The influence of the particle morphology and the concentration of the ZnO electron extraction layer on the general performance of the OSC devices is discussed in detail.

Abstract: Radiative recombination of carriers in two kinds of GaxIn1−xP/GaAs double-junction tandem solar cell structures was investigated by using room-temperature electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) techniques. Efficient radiative recombination was observed simultaneously in the top and the bottom subcells in both the samples. By studying the behavior of EL and PL spectra, the radiative recombination intensity ΦEL was demonstrated to be reliant on the material-dependent radiative recombination coefficient, base layer doping concentration and thickness. Furthermore, dependence of ΦEL on substrate misorientation in both the subcells was also evidenced, which was explained in terms of the growth-induced variations in microstructure for the GaInP top cell and in potential barrier profile across the p–n junction for the GaAs bottom cell. Based on these observations, the radiative recombination in the two base layers of the subcells was demonstrated to be the major carrier loss mechanism in the GaxIn1−xP/GaAs double-junction tandem photovoltaic devices and should be suppressed.

Abstract: Chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) is a member of C-C chemokine superfamily that contributes to inflammatory and fibrotic process. Studies in patients and experimental animals provide compelling evidence that increased CCL2 expression plays an important role in the development of fibroproliferative lung disease. The up-regulated CCL2 expression in pulmonary fibrosis is also involved in the potent profibrotic effects that thrombin exerts during lung injury. Here, we investigated the transcriptional mechanism involved in CCL2 production by thrombin in human primary lung fibroblasts and explored the transcriptional mechanism of increased CCL2 expression in pulmonary fibrosis. Thrombin increased CCL2 mRNA levels but not mRNA stability, suggesting it was acting transcriptionally. The increased binding of transcription factors to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) elements in the CCL2 promoter contributed to active transcription following thrombin stimulation. Primary human lung fibroblasts isolated from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) produced significantly higher levels of CCL2 than nonfibrotic lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays detected increased binding of NF-κB p65 and AP-1 subunit c-Jun to the CCL2 promoter of IPF cells both in the presence and absence of thrombin stimulation. The significantly increased binding of p65 and c-Jun to the CCL2 promoter was also observed in the lung tissue of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis murine model. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that the increased binding of transcription factors to NF-κB and AP-1 elements in the CCL2 promoter is responsible for the active transcription expression of CCL2 in pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) multilayers consisting of nm-thin, alternating Si-rich Si1−xCx and stoichiometric SiC layers were prepared using plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. Such multilayers are possible precursor layers for forming Si nanocrystals (NCs) for Si-based tandem solar cells. The multilayers were annealed at temperatures up to 1000°C for 30min and the crystallization of Si NCs in a SiC matrix was investigated. The annealing temperature affected the nanostructure of the multilayers and was studied using various techniques: by scanning electron microscopy we observed that the total thickness of the multilayers was reduced during annealing by 30%. X-ray diffraction revealed the crystallization of Si and SiC NCs when annealing temperatures exceeded 900°C. The crystal structure and the nanostructure were investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) bright-field imaging, high resolution TEM and electron diffraction. By electron diffraction it was proved that SiC crystallized in the cubic polytype 3C-SiC during the annealing process. Energy-filtered TEM showed a roughening of the multilayer structure when crystalline phases were formed. Aberration-corrected high-resolution images yielded lattice fringe images of the SiC and Si NCs. The size of the NCs was 5nm for Si and 2nm for SiC. Raman spectroscopy and electron diffraction showed that a large fraction of Si was still amorphous after annealing at 900°C. Annealing at 1000°C reduced the fraction of the amorphous phase by ∼35% for Si and ∼25% for SiC and strongly affected the crystalline perfection of the NCs and also the integrity of the layers. In contrast to Si NCs in a SiO2 matrix, Si NCs in a SiC matrix did not yield significant photoluminescence possible reasons will be discussed.

Abstract: The Notch signaling system features a growing number of modulators that include extracellular proteins that bind to the Notch ectodomain. Collagens are a complex, heterogeneous family of secreted proteins that serve both structural and signaling functions, most prominently through binding to integrins and DDR. The shared widespread tissue distribution of Notch and collagen prompted us to investigate the effects of collagen on Notch signaling. In a cell co-culture signaling assay, we found that type IV collagen inhibited Notch signaling in H460 and A7R5 cell lines. Moreover, Notch-stimulated expression of mature smooth muscle genes SMA, MHC, SM22, and calponin, which define the physiologic phenotype of normal vascular smooth muscle, was inhibited by type IV collagen in A7R5 cells. Cloned promoters of three of these genes were also inhibited by exposure to collagen. Collagen-dependent repression of Notch signaling required an RBP-jK site within the SM22 promoter. Moreover, repression by collagen required extracellular stimulation of the Notch signaling pathway. Type IV collagen bound to both Notch3 and Jagged1 proteins in purified protein binding assays. In addition, type I collagen also inhibited Notch signaling and bound to Notch and Jagged. We conclude that type IV and type I collagen repress canonical Notch signaling to alter expression of Notch target genes.

Abstract: To determine the output capability of present organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials, it is important to know the theoretical maximum coating speeds of the used semiconductor formulations. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of the coating stability window of several prototype organic semiconductor inks relevant for organic solar cells. The coating stability window was first determined experimentally by a sheet to sheet coater at velocities of up to 10m/min. A numerical simulation model based on the “Coating Window Suite 2010” software was established to give insight into the coating stability limitations at higher coating velocities. An analysis of PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)] in a water/isopropyl alcohol mixture as well as P3HT:PCBM [poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester] in chlorobenzene, o-xylene and tetrahydronaphthalene showed the possibility of coating speeds up to 60m/min. The simulation further revealed the maximum coating head distances for a given wet film thickness. Finally, we show a solar-cell with slot-die coated PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:PCBM-layer based on the parameters obtained by the simulated data, which exhibits reasonable performance.

Abstract: A novel approach for contacting buried layers in silicon solar cells is presented in this work using laser doping to pattern, diffuse the surface layer and make electrical contact to the underlying silicon in a single step. Electron beam induced current images are used to determine the cross-sectional junction profiles for laser doping using both n- and p-type dopants on textured and planar surfaces. It is observed that using a processing speed of 0.5m/s, junction depths of more than 11μm can be achieved independent of the dopant type and surface morphology. By laser doping using a boron spin on dopant source through a 100Ω/□ phosphorus emitter, direct contact can be made to the underlying p-type base silicon for a processing speed of 0.2m/s. For processing speeds of 0.5–2m/s, insufficient mixing of the dopants within the laser doped region can result in the formation of localised transistor structures forming in the peripheral areas of the laser doped region, reducing the ability to make direct contact to the underlying silicon without the risk of shunting to the surrounding n-type surface region. At higher processing speeds, no p-type region is formed. Initial work for using p-type laser doping to penetrate through an n-type emitter and contact the underlying p-type base silicon indicate that some shunting is present between the n-type emitter and heavily doped p-type silicon. However this shunting is reduced by increasing the depth of the laser doped regions.

Abstract: Tumorigenesis implies adaptation of tumor cells to an adverse environment. First, developing tumors must acquire nutrients to ensure their rapid growth. Second, they must escape the attack from the host immune system. Recent studies suggest that these phenomena could be related and that tumor cell metabolism may propel tumor immune escape. Tumor cell metabolism tends to avoid mitochondrial activity and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and largely relies on glycolysis to produce energy. This specific metabolism helps tumor cells to avoid the immune attack from the host by blocking or avoiding the immune attack. By changing their metabolism, tumor cells produce or sequester a variety of amino acids, lipids and chemical compounds that directly alter immune function therefore promoting immune evasion. A second group of metabolism-related modification targets the major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) and related molecules. Tumor MHC-I presents tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and hence, sensitizes cancer cells to the cytolytic actions of the anti-tumor adaptive immune response. Blocking tumor mitochondrial activity decreases expression of MHC-I molecules at the tumor cell surface. And peroxynitrite (PNT), produced by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, chemically modifies MHC-I avoiding TAA expression in the plasma membrane. These evidences on the role of tumor cell metabolism on tumor immune escape open the possibility of combining drugs designed to control tumor cell metabolism with new procedures of anti-tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: In this study, WO3 nanostructured films were prepared by sol–gel spin coating process on glass substrates and drops of PdCl2 solution were used as an aqueous hydrogen catalyst for gasochromic investigations. As deposited WO3 films were annealed at different temperatures of 100, 200, 300 and 400°C in air. The effect of annealing temperature on crystalline structure and surface morphology of WO3 films was studied by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and/or Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed the variation of chemical bonds with annealing temperature. Because of the aqueous nature of hydrogen catalyst, hydrophilicity of samples was measured by means of contact angle and it was found to increase with annealing temperature. We found a correlation between annealing temperature, hydrophilicity, palladium growth and coloring of tungsten oxide films when an aqueous hydrogen catalyst is used. The effect of catalyst concentration on colored state optical density was also studied for films annealed at 400°C.

Abstract: The mechanism(s) behind the decreased ability of insulin to facilitate glucose uptake in insulin sensitive tissues as seen in type 2 diabetes is not resolved. With the rapidly increasing prevalence of this disease world-wide, and the many complications that follow the disease, large resources are used in the attempt to resolve the mechanisms of insulin resistance. In this context, a dysfunction of mitochondria in the skeletal muscle has been suggested to play a pivotal role. It has been postulated that a decrease in the content of mitochondria in the skeletal muscle can explain the insulin resistance. Complementary to this also specific defects of components in the respiratory chain in the mitochondria have been suggested to play a role in insulin resistance. A key element in these mechanistic suggestions is inability to handle substrate fluxes and subsequently an accumulation of ectopic intramyocellular lipids, interfering with insulin signaling. In this review we will present the prevailing view-points and argue for the unlikelihood of this scenario being instrumental in human insulin resistance.

Abstract: Mitochondrial biogenesis is activated by nuclear encoded transcription co-activator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), which is regulated by several upstream factors including protein kinase A and Akt/protein kinase B. We have previously shown that selenoprotein H enhances the levels of nuclear regulators for mitochondrial biogenesis, increases mitochondrial mass and improves mitochondrial respiratory rate, under physiological condition. Furthermore, overexpression of selenoprotein H protects neuronal HT22 cells from ultraviolet B irradiation-induced cell damage by lowering reactive oxygen species production, and inhibiting activation of caspase-3 and -9, as well as p53. The objective of this study is to identify the cell signaling pathways by which selenoprotein H initiates mitochondrial biogenesis. We first confirmed our previous observation that selenoprotein H transfected HT22 cells increased the protein levels of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial biogenesis factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A. We then observed that total and phosphorylation of protein kinase A, Akt/protein kinase B and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) were significantly increased in selenoprotein H transfected cells compared to vector transfected HT22 cells. To verify whether the observed stimulating effects on mitochondrial biogenesis pathways are caused by selenoprotein H and mediated through CREB, we knocked down selenoprotein H mRNA level using siRNA and inhibited CREB with napthol AS-E phosphate in selenoprotein H transfected cells and repeated the measurements of the aforementioned biomarkers. Our results revealed that silencing of selenoprotein H not only decreased the protein levels of PGC-1α, nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A, but also decreased the total and phosphorylation levels of protein kinase A, protein kinase B, and CREB. Similarly, CREB inhibition reduced CREB activation and PGC-1α protein levels in selenoprotein H transfected cells. Moreover, selenoprotein H transfection increased the activity of mitochondrial complexes and prevented the ultraviolet B induced fall of mitochondrial membrane potential. We conclude that the effects of selenoprotein H on mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function are probably mediated through protein kinase A-CREB-PGC-1α and Akt/protein kinase B-CREB-PGC-1α pathways.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate tandem amorphous/microcrystalline silicon solar cells with asymmetric intermediate reflectors grown in the n–i–p substrate configuration. We compare different types of substrates with respect to their light-trapping properties as well as their influence on the growth of single-junction microcrystalline cells. Our most promising back reflector combines a textured zinc oxide film grown by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, a silver film for reflection, and a zinc oxide buffer layer. Grown on this substrate, microcrystalline cells exhibit excellent response in the infrared while keeping high open-circuit voltage and fill factor, leading to efficiencies of up to 10.0%. After optimizing the morphology of the asymmetric intermediate reflector, we achieve an n–i–p micromorph solar cell stabilized efficiency of 11.6%, using 270nm and 1.7μm of silicon for the absorber layer of the amorphous top cell and the microcrystalline bottom cell, respectively. Using this original device architecture, we reach efficiencies close to those of state-of-the-art n–i–p and p–i–n micromorph devices, demonstrating a promising route to deposit high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells on opaque substrates.

Abstract: Krüppel-like family is a group of zinc-finger transcription factors which play key regulatory roles in cellular growth, development, differentiation and vascularization. Recent studies have shown that one of the members, KLF10, is specifically involved in the process of angiogenesis by acting as a key transcriptional regulator of TGF-β1 in pro-angiogenic cells differentiation and function. KLF10−/− mice also displayed impaired blood flow recovery after hindlimb ischemia. However, the mechanism of KLF10 induced angiogenesis is still not well understood. From ChIP-chip, which have been adopt to elucidate the novel target genes and signaling cascades of KLF10, COX-1 (also named as PTGS1) is one of the target genes that may be regulated by Klf10 through promoter binding. In order to investigate the function of KLF10/COX-1 axis, promoter activity, EMSA, ChIP-PCR and tube formation assays were serially performed. Our results demonstrated that KLF10 acts as a transcriptional activator on COX-1 promoter where overexpression of KLF10 induces COX-1 protein expression and mRNA expression in endothelial cells. It has been known that COX-1 is the key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis which regulated angiogenesis in endothelial cells. Using tube formation assay, we further demonstrated that KLF10 overexpressed endothelial cells formed better organized three-dimensional tube structure in contrast to the control group did. To specifically investigate the role for KLF10 in angiogenesis, the its deficient mice exhibited decreased light transmission which represents the extend of platelet aggregation slowing down. Taken together, our results indicate an important role for KLF10 in angiogenesis through the activation of COX-1.

Abstract: The mammalian sperm acrosome reaction is a calcium-dependent exocytotic event characterized by extensive fusion between the plasma and the outer acrosomal membrane. The mechanisms by which elevation of cytosolic calcium initiates the membrane fusion process are not understood and the present study was undertaken to identify calcium-binding proteins in the acrosomal membrane (AM) of bovine spermatozoa. Sperm heads, purified from sonicated spermatozoa, were used to isolate an acrosomal membrane-enriched fraction on Percoll density gradients. Using SDS-PAGE and a 45Ca2+-blot overlay assay, calcium-binding proteins of 64, 45, 43, and 39kDa were identified in the AM enriched fraction. Phase separation analysis with Triton X-114 identified the 64kDa polypeptide as an integral membrane protein. The 64kDa polypeptide was purified and utilized to prepare a polyclonal antiserum. Both light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the protein was distributed throughout all domains of the acrosomal membrane. These results identify a 64kDa calcium-binding integral membrane protein of the mammalian acrosome. Its potential function in calcium-dependent membrane fusion events of the acrosome reaction and in fertilization is discussed.

To address this question we have used a pure female population of rat heart embryonic H9c2 cells. Pre-treatment of cells with testosterone for 24h significantly increased survival of H9c2 cells exposed to 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation. These cells expressed low level of androgen receptors and the effect of testosterone was not modified by hydroxyflutamide, an antagonist of androgen receptor. In contrast, cyclohexamide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis, and tamoxifene, a partial agonist of estrogen receptors, abolished cardioprotection afforded by testosterone. In addition, finasteride, an inhibitor of 5α-reductase, and anastrazole, an inhibitor of α-aromatase, also blocked testosterone-induced cytoprotection. Real time RT-PCR revealed that testosterone did not regulate the expression of nine subunits and accessory proteins of sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. On the other hand, testosterone, as well as 17β-estradiol, up-regulated a putative mitochondrial KATP channel subunit, mitochondrial sulfonylurea receptor 2B intraexonics splice variant (IES SUR2B), without affecting expression of IES SUR2A. Tamoxifene inhibited testosterone-induced up-regulation of IES SUR2B without affecting IES SUR2A. In conclusion, this study has shown that testosterone protect female embryonic heart H9c2 cells against severe metabolic stress by its conversion into metabolites that activate estrogen receptors and up-regulate IES SUR2B.

Abstract: CA19.9 antigen is a glycoprotein present in human serum and found elevated in various diseases. It is intensively studied since long time as a potential marker for managing cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, but its reliability is widely accepted only for pancreatic cancers. Here, we focused on the tetrasaccharide epitope (NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3[Fucα1-4]GlcNAc) sialyl-Lewis a studying the biosynthesis, expression, and secretion in colon cancers and related cancer cell lines. We found that the β1,3 galactosyltransferase β3Gal-T5, responsible for sialyl-Lewis a synthesis, is dramatically reduced in colon adenocarcinomas, in terms of both transcript and enzyme activity levels. Moreover, no or very faint antigen is detectable in colon cancer homogenates, by dot-blot or enzyme immunoassay, while it is commonly evident in sera from different patients. In cancer cell lines synthesizing CA19.9, the amount of antigen secreted is proportional to that expressed on the cell surface, and depends on appreciable levels of β3Gal-T5, which appear much higher than those measured in colon cancer specimens. Since colon cancers appear unable to synthesize relevant amount of CA19.9, we suggest that the antigen circulating in the serum of colon cancer patients may have a different and more complex origin than expected so far.

Abstract: The characterization of InxGa1−xN/GaN-based solar cells with a InxGa1−xN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) structure on SiCN/Si(111) substrates at various operation temperatures is reported. Solar cell operation with a low dark-current density (Jd), a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), and a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) is demonstrated. An increase in the operation temperature results in increases in Jd and Jsc, but decreases in Voc, the fill factor (FF), and the photovoltaic efficiency (η). Device configurations with various levels of indium content are investigated under an air mass 1.5 global solar spectrum. The proposed structure can be used for fabricating solar cells with a low Jd of 2.01–4.27μA/cm2, a high Voc of 2.34–2.94V, a high Jsc of 2.71–2.82mA/cm2, a high FF of 64.40–75.01%, and a high η of 4.25–5.99%.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells with a longer lifetime than that of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-based OPV cells were fabricated using UV/ozone-treated graphene sheets as hole extraction layers (HELs). The sheet resistance increased from 1.1kΩ/sq to infinity and the transmittance at 550nm decreased from 95.2% to 93.8% after UV–ozone treatment for 9min due to the formation of carbon–oxygen functionalization layers. The intensity of the C–C, C–O, and C=O bonds in X-ray photoemission spectroscopy spectra increased with increasing UV–ozone treatment time, indicating the bonding formation between carbon and oxygen. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy data showed that the work function of graphene increased from 4.3eV to 4.85eV after UV/ozone treatment for 9min. However, the OPV cell with 5min-treated graphene HEL displayed the best efficiency of 3.0% because the graphene sheet was damaged by UV–ozone exposure after 7min. The efficiency of the PEDOT:PSS-based device rapidly decreased to 0% after 14h exposure in humid conditions while the UV/ozone-treated device continued to operate for 26h. These results suggested that UV/ozone-treated graphene under optimized condition is a good HEL candidate in OPV cells as a replacement for the conventional PEDOT:PSS layer.

Abstract: This focus makes a case that mitophagy is not a straightforward process obeying simple rules. It is a complex process through which the cell gets rid of both damaged and healthy untainted mitochondria to adjust their amount, and in accordance with cellular energy requirements. Several aspects of mitophagy have been described in both yeast and mammalian cells. They have revealed a number of discrepancies in the regulation of this process in the two eukaryotic models. Data have shown that mitophagy is a function of cell physiology. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

Abstract: Anthocynanins, found in fruits and vegetables, have a variety of protective properties, which have generally been attributed to their antioxidant capacity. However, antioxidants are generally strong reductants, and some reductants have been found to block apoptosis by reducing cytosolic cytochrome c, which prevents caspase activation. We tested the ability of various anthocyanins: to reduce cytochrome c, to support cytochrome c-induced mitochondrial respiration and to inhibit apoptosis induced by heart ischemia. Anthocyanins such as delphinidin-3-glucoside (Dp3G) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy3G) were able to reduce cytochrome c directly and rapidly, whereas pelargonidin-3-glucoside (Pg3G), malvinidin-3-glucoside (Mv3G) and peonidin-3-glucoside (Pn3G) had relatively low cytochrome c reducing activities. Dp3G and Cy3G but not Pg3G supported mitochondrial state 4 respiration in the presence of exogenous cytochrome c. Pre-perfusion of hearts with 20μM Cy3G but not Pg3G prevented ischemia-induced caspase activation. This suggests that the ability of anthocyanins to block caspase activation may be due to their ability to reduce cytosolic cytochrome c.

Abstract: We describe an approach to solar downconversion in which a semiconductor is used for absorption, and substitutional rare earth ions are used for emission. The semiconductor would provide broad-band absorption, and the rare earth ions would provide emission of multiple photons by a cross relaxation process in a narrow wavelength band. The emitted photons are then absorbed by a solar cell formed from a low band gap semiconductor such as silicon. Er and Yb are suggested owing to strong emission at 980nm which are useful when the down-converter is paired with silicon solar cells. The use of InGaN is proposed for the absorbing host semiconductor.

Abstract: Viroporins are a group of viral proteins that participate in viral replication cycles, including modification of membrane permeability and promotion of viral release. Although biological data have been accumulated on viroporion-like proteins of other viruses belonging to family Flaviviridae, the viroporin activity and membrane topology of p7 protein from classical swine fever virus (CSFV), a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, are largely unknown. In this study, sequence analysis of the primary structure of p7 polypeptide demonstrates that p7 contains two putative transmembrane regions connected by a short hydrophilic segment. Expression of p7 protein in Escherichia coli leads to the permeabilization of bacterial cells to small molecules. The p7 protein also enhances the permeability of mammalian cells, increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and the permeability of cells to the translation inhibitor Hygromycin B. This protein is an integral membrane protein and can form homo-oligomers. It mainly localizes to the ER at the early stage of the expression and can be transferred to the plasma membrane at the late stage of the expression. Detergent permeabilization assays confirmed that the p7 protein is a 2-pass transmembrane protein and its N and C termini are exposed to the ER lumen. Deletion analysis showed that amino acid residues 41–63 may be essential for the viroporin activity of the protein. Our studies demonstrate that CSFV p7 possesses properties commonly associated with viroporins, which could be a potential target for the development of a therapeutic intervention for classic swine fever virus infection.

Abstract: Osteoblastic differentiation is controlled by complex interplay of several signaling pathways and associated key transcription factors, as well as by microRNAs (miRNAs). In our current study, we found miR-181a to be highly upregulated during BMP induced osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12 and MC3T3 cells. Overexpression of miR-181a led to upregulation of key markers of osteoblastic differentiation as well as enhanced ALP levels and Alizarin red staining, indicating the importance of this miRNA for osteoblastic differentiation. Further, we show that miR-181 isoforms (181a, 181b, 181c) are expressed during different stages of mouse calvarial and tibial development, implying their role in both endochondral and intramembranous ossification. We found several direct and indirect targets of miR-181a to be downregulated by global mRNA expression profiling. Our results demonstrate that miR-181a promotes osteoblastic differentiation via repression of TGF-β signaling molecules by targeting the negative regulator of osteoblastic differentiation Tgfbi (Tgf-beta induced) and TβR-I/Alk5 (TGF-β type I receptor). Furthermore, our findings suggest that Rgs4 and Gata6 are direct targets of miR-181a. Taken together, we provide evidence for a crucial functional link between a specific miRNA, miR-181a and osteoblastic differentiation.

Abstract: We have carried out experiments on both boron diffusion gettering (BDG) and phosphorus diffusion gettering (PDG) in n-type multicrystalline silicon. We have focused our research on the highly contaminated edge areas of the silicon ingot often referred to as the red zone. Due to poor carrier lifetime attributed to these areas, they induce a significant material loss in solar cell manufacturing. In our experiments, the red zone was found to disappear after a specific BDG treatment and a lifetime improvement from 5μs up to 670μs was achieved. Outside the red zone, lifetimes even up to 850μs were measured after gettering. Against the common hypothesis, we found higher dopant in-diffusion temperature beneficial both for the red zone and the good grains making BDG more efficient than PDG. To explain the results we suggest that high temperature leads to more complete dissolution of metal precipitates, which enhances the diffusion gettering to the emitter.

Abstract: CuInSe2 (CIS) thin films were formed on a Mo-coated soda lime glass with a newly formulated hybrid ink composed of binary Cu2−xSe nanoparticles and an In precursor solution. The thin films were fabricated by the spin coating method and a subsequent selenization process, and the compositional and structural properties of the CIS thin films were characterized. Deposition of a hybrid ink provides the unique advantage of producing centers composed of pure material-based nanoparticles that can promote stress-relief and crack-deflection. Additionally, hybrid inks offer efficient binding with nanoparticles by using precursor solutions without other organic binders. Binary Cu2−xSe nanoparticles were synthesized by a low-temperature colloidal process, and an In precursor solution was prepared by using a non-toxic chelating agent for dispersing the In component stably. The band gap of the CIS thin film was measured to be 1.14eV by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) technique, and the best conversion efficiency of the fabricated device was determined to be 4.19%.

Abstract: Since the days of the technology's conception, concerns have been voiced over potential supply constraints of Tellurium that could limit the large-scale deployment of the Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) solar photovoltaic technology. Because any potential supply-demand imbalance created by a Tellurium constraint would manifest itself in the form of a price increase (a trend that was already seen prior to the 2012 downturn in PV manufacturing), we have rigorously examined the sensitivity of total CdTe module manufacturing prices to the price of this minor metal. We found that module manufacturers could conceivably absorb a gradual increase in Te prices up to an order of magnitude higher than what was typical for 2011 without significantly compromising their near to mid-term competitive position within the PV industry (viewed here to be a $0.70/W module price)—if the pace of improvements in module power conversion efficiencies and reductions in the CdTe layer thickness is rapid enough. Realizing gains in module-area efficiencies while, at the same time, also reducing the CdTe thickness is certainly technically challenging and merits its own line of research. However, in order to accommodate up to an order of magnitude increase in Te prices while still keeping the cost of the active layer to a reasonable $0.15/W range, we find that the cost benefits gained by reducing the absorber layer thickness are expected to be as significant as those provided by efficiency gains alone. Realizing the optimistic target of 18% efficient modules with 1.0μm of CdTe could reduce the Te material intensity from today's requirement of around 74 metric tonnes (MT) per GW to 17MT/GW; even so, we estimate that CdTe PV is likely to be material constrained to around 10GW of annual production by 2020 unless new sources of Tellurium—beyond traditional copper byproduct sources at the current 55% recovery rate—come online. The economics of this mineral are such that a higher price offering is a necessary precondition in order to motivate enhanced recovery rates from copper mining, and for future direct mining projects.

Abstract: A small-molecule donor material of 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl] squaraine (SQ) was used to fabricate the solution-processed solar cells with fullerene. The thermal annealing process and the solvent additive method were systematically investigated to illuminate their effects on the performance of solar cells. The optimized device exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.31% under 1 sun, AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation with thermal annealing at 50°C and a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive with a volume ratio of 0.4%. A reduced surface roughness and improved charge carrier mobility were ascribed to the enhancement of PCE in DIO incorporated devices. The simulation using a theoretical model of charge transfer state based on Onsager–Braun theory was carried out, and the results revealed that thermal annealing and solvent additive could facilitate charge transfer dissociation, increase charge carrier generation, and thereby improve the performance of solar cells based on SQ: fullerene bulk heterojunction.

Abstract: The role of polyamines at the G1/S boundary and in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle was studied using synchronized HeLa cells treated with thymidine or with thymidine and aphidicolin. Synchronized cells were cultured in the absence or presence of α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, plus ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (EGBG), an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. When polyamine content was reduced by treatment with DFMO and EGBG, the transition from G1 to S phase was delayed. In parallel, the level of p27Kip1 was greatly increased, so its mechanism was studied in detail. Synthesis of p27Kip1 was stimulated at the level of translation by a decrease in polyamine levels, because of the existence of long 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) in p27Kip1 mRNA. Similarly, the transition from the G2/M to the G1 phase was delayed by a reduction in polyamine levels. In parallel, the number of multinucleate cells increased by 3-fold. This was parallel with the inhibition of cytokinesis due to an unusual distribution of actin and α-tubulin at the M phase. Since an association of polyamines with chromosomes was not observed by immunofluorescence microscopy at the M phase, polyamines may have only a minor role in structural changes of chromosomes at the M phase. In general, the involvement of polyamines at the G2/M phase was smaller than that at the G1/S boundary.

Abstract: Red wine polyphenolic compounds (RWPC) are reported to exert vasculoprotective properties on endothelial cells, involving nitric oxide (NO) release via a redox-sensitive pathway. This NO release involves the activation of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα). Paradoxical effects of a RWPC treatment occur in a rat model of post-ischemic neovascularization, where a low-dose is pro-angiogenic while a higher dose is anti-angiogenic. NO and ERα are key regulators of mitochondrial capacity, and angiogenesis is a highly energetic process associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. However, whether RWPC induces changes in mitochondrial capacity has never been addressed. We investigated the effects of RWPC at low (10−4g/l, LCP) and high concentration (10−2g/l, HCP) in human endothelial cells. Mitochondrial respiration, expression of mitochondrial biogenesis factors and mitochondrial DNA content were assessed using oxygraphy and quantitative PCR respectively. In vitro capillary formation using ECM gel® was also performed. Treatment with LCP increased mitochondrial respiration, with a maximal effect achieved at 48h. LCP also increased expression of several mitochondrial biogenesis factors and mitochondrial DNA content. In contrast, HCP did not affect these parameters. Furthermore, LCP modulated both mitochondrial capacity and angiogenesis through mechanisms sensitive to ER, NADPH oxidase and NO-synthase inhibitors. Finally, the inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis abolished the pro-angiogenic capacity of LCP. These results suggest a possible association between the modulation of mitochondrial capacity by LCP and its pro-angiogenic activity. These data provide evidence for a role of mitochondria in the regulation of angiogenesis by RWPC.

Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental analysis of photocarrier kinetics in quantum dot (QD) solar cells. The measurements of the J–V characteristics reveal strong effects of QD charging by selective doping of the interdot space on the solar cell characteristics. We demonstrate that charging of QDs significantly increases electron coupling to sub-bandgap photons, provides effective harvesting of IR energy, and serve as an effective tool for manipulating the potential profile at the micro- and nanoscale. The potential well for electrons in InAs QDs is substantially deeper than that for holes and, due to major differences between the effective masses of electrons and holes, the electron level spacing is substantially larger than the level spacing for holes. Therefore, QDs act as deep traps for electrons but shallow traps for holes. Filling of QDs under illumination is determined by a condition of equality of electron and hole capture rates which is realized via strong exponential dependence of the capture rates on the potential barrier around a charged dot. Without adequate doping of the QD medium, QDs are filled by electrons from the n-doped junction area and deteriorate the solar cell performance. However, selective n-doping of the QD medium results in micro- and nanoscale potential profiles favorable for photovoltaic conversion. Potential barriers around charged QDs decrease the photoelectron capture processes and suppress recombination processes via QDs. The filling of QDs predominantly from dopants in the QD medium allows one to maintain the microscale potential profile analogous to that in the best conventional single-junction solar cells.

Abstract: Mercury, anthropogenic release of uranium (U), and nanoparticles constitute hazardous environmental pollutants able to accumulate along the aquatic food chain with severe risk for animal and human health. The impact of such pollutants on living organisms has been up to now approached by classical toxicology in which huge doses of toxic compounds, environmentally irrelevant, are displayed through routes that never occur in the lifespan of organisms (for instance injecting a bolus of mercury to an animal although the main route is through prey and fish eating). We wanted to address the effect of such pollutants on the muscle and brain mitochondrial bioenergetics under realistic conditions, at unprecedented low doses, using an aquatic model animal, the zebrafish Danio rerio. We developed an original method to measure brain mitochondrial respiration: a single brain was put in 1.5mL conical tube containing a respiratory buffer. Brains were gently homogenized by 13 strokes with a conical plastic pestle, and the homogenates were immediately used for respiration measurements. Skinned muscle fibers were prepared by saponin permeabilization. Zebrafish were contaminated with food containing 13μg of methylmercury (MeHg)/g, an environmentally relevant dose. In permeabilized muscle fibers, we observed a strong inhibition of both state 3 mitochondrial respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity after 49 days of MeHg exposure. We measured a dramatic decrease in the rate of ATP release by skinned muscle fibers. Contrarily to muscles, brain mitochondrial respiration was not modified by MeHg exposure although brain accumulated twice as much MeHg than muscles. When zebrafish were exposed to 30μg/L of waterborne U, the basal mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was decreased in muscles after 28 days of exposure. This was due to an increase of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability. The impact of a daily ration of food containing gold nanoparticles of two sizes (12 and 50nm) was investigated at a very low dose for 60 days (40ng gold/fish/day). Mitochondrial dysfunctions appeared in brain and muscle for both tested sizes. In conclusion, at low environmental doses, dietary or waterborne heavy metals impinged on zebrafish tissue mitochondrial respiration. Due to its incredible simplicity avoiding tedious and time-consuming mitochondria isolation, our one-pot method allowing brain respiratory analysis should give colleagues the incentive to use zebrafish brain as a model in bioenergetics.

Abstract: Large-area, flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules are fabricated successfully by gravure printing in air, using an industrial-scale printing proofer of similar performance to commercial roll-to-roll printing processes. Both the hole transport layer, poly-3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene:poly(styrene sulfonic-acid) (PEDOT:PSS), and the active layer, poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM), are successively printed on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated polyethylene terephthalate (ITO/PET) substrates with evaporated aluminum (Al) top electrodes. The 45cm2 modules, composed of 5 cells connected in series, show power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 1.0%, in which the short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) are as high as 7.14mA/cm2 and 2.74V (0.55V per cell), respectively. The PCEs could be potentially improved by the further optimization of the layer interface, layer morphology and flexible substrate properties. The results suggest that gravure printing may be a suitable technique for fast commercial processing of large-area, flexible OPVs with high output.

Abstract: Heat shock factor 4b has been found to be closely associated with postnatal lens development. It expresses in postnatal lens epithelial and secondary fiber cells and controls the expression of small heat shock proteins which are important for lens homeostasis. However, the signal pathways underlying Hsf4b are still not completely understood. Here we present that Hsf4b transcription activity is regulated by FGF2 a key growth factor that is involved in regulating lens development at multiple stages. FGF2 can promote Hsf4b nuclear-translocation and the expression of Hsp25 and αB-crystallin, the key downstream targets of Hsf4b in the Hsf4b-reconstituted mouse hsf4−/− lens epithelial cells. Further study indicates that FGF2 can induce Hsf4b protein stabilization through ERK1/2-mediated posttranslational phosphorylation or sumoylation. Hsf4b can promote FGF2-induced morphology transition from lens epithelial cell to the fiber cell, and this morphology transition can be inhibited by ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Hsf4b is a novel downstream transcription factor of FGF2, and its transcription activity is associated with FGF2-modulated lens epithelial cell–fiber cell transition.

Nop-7-associated 2 (NSA2), a candidate gene for diabetic nephropathy, is involved in the TGFβ1 pathway,

Abstract: We recently showed that Nop-7-associated 2 (NSA2) originally described in yeast as a nuclear protein involved in ribosomal biogenesis, is a hyperglycemia induced gene involved in diabetic nephropathy [Shahni et al., Elevated levels of renal and circulating Nop-7-associated 2 (NSA2) in rat and mouse models of diabetes, in mesangial cells in vitro and in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Diabetologia 2012;55(March(3)):825–34]. However the function of NSA2 in the cell remains unknown. In the current paper we investigate the possible mechanisms for the involvement of NSA2 in diabetic nephropathy by testing the hypothesis that NSA2 expression is linked to the TGFβ1 pathway. Both TGFβ1 and NSA2 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in cultured renal mesangial cells in response to high glucose, in mouse kidneys during hyperglycemia, and in developing kidneys of mouse embryos during mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Surprisingly, the previously described nuclear NSA2 protein was predominantly located in the cytosol of cultured renal cells. Exogenous TGFβ1 could elevate NSA2 mRNA/protein levels in cultured mesangial cells and could also affect the cellular localization of NSA2, causing the predominantly cytosolic NSA2 protein to rapidly translocate to the nucleus. Increased NSA2 nuclear staining was seen in diabetic mouse kidneys compared to control kidneys. Knock-down of NSA2 expression using RNA interference resulted in significantly decreased TGFβ1 mRNA/protein, almost abolished TGFβ1 activity, and resulted in significantly reduced mRNA levels of the TGFβ1 downstream gene fibronectin. Our data suggest that NSA2 is acting upstream of the TGFβ1 pathway and that NSA2 is needed for TGFβ1 expression and transcriptional activity. In summary, NSA2, which increases in diabetic nephropathy, may be involved in the actions of TGFβ1 and contribute to the development of diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) gravure exhibits significant advantages such as high precision and throughput for the printing of photoactive and conductive materials and the fabrication of flexible organic electronics such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Since the photoactive layer is the core of the OPV, it is important to investigate and finally control the process parameters and mechanisms that define the film morphology in a R2R process. The scope of this work is to study the effect of the R2R gravure printing and drying process on the nanomorphology and nanostructure of the photoactive P3HT:PCBM thin films printed on PEDOT:PSS electrodes towards the fabrication of indium tin oxide (ITO)-free flexible OPVs. In order to achieve this, P3HT:PCBM blends of different concentration were R2R printed under various speeds on the PEDOT:PSS layers. Due to the limited drying time during the rolling, an amount of solvent remains in the P3HT:PCBM films and the slow-drying process takes place which leads to the vertical and lateral phase separation, according to the Spectroscopic Ellipsometry and Atomic Force Microscopy analysis. The enhanced slow-drying leads to stronger phase separation, larger P3HT crystallites according to the Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction data and to weaker mechanical response as it was shown by the nanoindentation creep. However, in the surface of the films the P3HT crystallization is controlled by the impinged hot air during the drying, where the more the drying time the larger the surface P3HT crystallites. The integration of the printed P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS layers in an OPV device underlined the feasibility of fabricating ITO-free flexible OPVs by R2R gravure processes.

Abstract: A Ge:Si solar cell under a silicon solar cell can lead to as much as a 5.5% absolute efficiency gain for a multi-junction solar module at 30× concentration. This work demonstrated short circuit current densities that were 93% of the model prediction and open circuit voltages that were 92% of the model predictions for 88% Ge content, Ge:Si solar cells below Si at 30 suns. Silicon solar cells can absorb few photons in the wavelength range above 1150nm due to the effect of the absorption coefficient. One possible method to enhance the absorption of long wavelength photons is to apply a Ge solar cell below Si. However, this method is industrially impractical due to the high cost of Ge substrates. In this work, a low cost Ge:Si solar cell grown on silicon with strong long wavelength light sensitivity will be demonstrated. This work starts with an all epitaxial growth design, analyzes the performance limits, examines the trade-offs between solar cell performance, Ge composition and material quality and concludes with the pathways to higher efficiency. The high quality Ge:Si layers with Ge content above 85% were achieved on Si substrates using reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) technology. Three high Ge content Ge:Si solar cells were designed, fabricated and analyzed. The encouraging results experimentally prove that low cost Ge:Si solar cells grown on Si can have high performance below Si. This has been achieved as a direct result of low dislocation density step graded Ge:Si buffers developed in this research. In this paper, the pathway to achieve low cost and high efficiency Ge:Si low band gap solar cells grown on silicon is described.

ERK1/2 regulates hepatocyte Trib1 in response to mitochondrial dysfunction,

Abstract: The TRIB1 locus (8q24.13) is a novel locus identified and replicated by several genome-wide association studies for associations with plasma triglycerides, apolipoprotein B and coronary artery disease. The TRIB1 protein product, tribbles-like protein 1 (Trib1), regulates MAPK activity. MAP kinases transduce a large variety of external signals, leading to a wide range of cellular responses, including growth, differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis. Importantly, Trib1 has been shown to regulate hepatic lipogenesis and very low density lipoprotein production. Despite the relevance of hepatocyte Trib1 to lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, little is known about the mechanisms regulating Trib1 itself. Here, we identify the mitochondria axis as a regulator of Trib1. Treatment of HepG2 cells with a short pulse of a low oligomycin concentration led to a potent and prolonged increase in the Trib1 mRNA, an effect that was shared with other mitochondria stressors. HuH7 cells as well murine hepatocytes were also responsive albeit to a weaker extent. The upregulation appeared largely independent of reactive oxygen species generation or metabolic stress and was mainly under transcriptional control, with ERK1/2 playing an important regulating role in the process. While the presence of the Trib1 protein could be inferred, attempts to correlate the increased mRNA to changes in protein level were unsuccessful due to the lack of recognizable Trib1 signal. Our data enrich the current paradigm of Trib1 as an activator of the MAPK pathway by uncovering a role for MAPK in regulating Trib1.

Abstract: Accuracy in composition control has been one of the top issues for fabricating high-performance kesterite (Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)4) solar cells. A detailed understanding of the effect of Zn excess on device performance has not yet been demonstrated. Thus, specific criteria for high-performance devices, in particular discriminating between the effects of Zn-rich features at the front versus the back of the absorber, are desired. In this study, we report that co-evaporated kesterite absorbers can demonstrate high device efficiency despite the presence of large quantities of ZnSe. However, the benign presence of ZnSe is found to be conditional. While large ZnSe grains on the back of the absorbers are not harmful to device performance, the ZnSe grains produced by excess Zn near the end of the deposition degrade the cell efficiency from 8% level to 6% level (without anti-reflection coatings). The other effect related to excess Zn on the front of absorber is the facilitation of breakdown in lower reverse bias. The breakdown indicated here occurs only under the illumination of blue photons, and to our best knowledge has not been reported before. The exact mechanism of the breakdown remains open, but it is demonstrated to be related to the photoconductivity of CdS, and is thus possibly a symptom of lateral defect issues in the absorber, caused by the overdose of Zn. The same type of issue contributing to the breakdown may also be responsible for part of the parasitic loses at the working voltage, and therefore warrants further research.

Abstract: We have previously shown that uncoupling protein 1 is present in thymus and has a role in T-cell development. As reactive oxygen species have been implicated in T-cell development, we set out to determine whether uncoupling protein 1 had the potential to regulate reactive oxygen species production in mitochondria isolated from thymus. This was achieved by inhibiting proton leak through uncoupling protein 1 using the purine nucleotide GDP and through ablation of uncoupling protein 1, measuring the amplex red sensitive reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria. In this work we demonstrate, for the first time, that uncoupling protein 1 has the potential to regulate reactive oxygen species production in thymus mitochondria. We also show that reverse electron transport is possible in thymus mitochondria respiring on succinate and glycerol-3-phosphate. The implications of this regulatory role for uncoupling protein 1 are discussed in the context of thymus function.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease caused by a deficiency in the production of insulin and/or by the effects of insulin resistance. Insulin deficiency leads to hyperglycemia which is the major initiator of diabetic cardiovascular complications escalating with time and driven by many complex biochemical and molecular processes. Four hypotheses, which propose mechanisms of diabetes-associated pathophysiology, are currently considered. Cardiovascular impairment may be caused by an increase in polyol pathway flux, by intracellular advanced glycation end-products formation or increased flux through the hexosamine pathway. The latter of these mechanisms involves activation of the protein kinase C. Cellular and mitochondrial metabolism alterations observed in the course of diabetes are partially associated with an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among many processes and factors involved in ROS production, the 66kDa isoform of the growth factor adaptor shc (p66Shc protein) is of particular interest. This protein plays a key role in the control of mitochondria-dependent oxidative balance thus it involvement in diabetic complications and other oxidative stress based pathologies is recently intensively studied. In this review we summarize the current understanding of hyperglycemia induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction with an emphasis on the oxidative stress and p66Shc protein.

Abstract: Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition is a good example of cell plasticity. In tumorigenesis, this process has been associated with metastasis. Overexpression of EZH2 has been detected in most malignant human tumors, including colorectal carcinomas. Herein, we provide evidence supporting the idea that oncogenic Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition in colon cancer cell models is partially controlled by epigenetic factors such as the transcription regulator EZH2. Evaluation of EZH2 mRNA and protein levels revealed overexpression in cell lines with metastatic traits. Analysis of EZH2 mRNA expression was expanded in clinical samples of colon cancer, and high level of EZH2 correlates with appearance of metastasis. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK and AKT pathways in metastatic colon cancer cell lines attenuates EZH2 overexpression. EZH2 promoter analysis illustrates presence of putative AP-1 binding sites and occupancy of transcription factors such as FRA-1 and C-JUN is demonstrated here on EZH2 promoter. Abrogation of EZH2 expression impairs the ability of colon cancer cells to move associated with anoikis in three-dimensional environment. Integrin alpha2 was identified to be a novel EZH2 target by chromatin immunoprecipitation and short hairpin RNA analysis. This study proposes that activation of ERK/AKT pathways and FRA1/C-JUN induce EZH2 overexpression, which results in Integrin alpha2 silencing. Our results show how deregulation of epigenetic factors and mechanisms can affect cancer cell aggressiveness and propose EZH2 as a potential metastasis marker and/or therapeutic target for colorectal cancer treatment.

Abstract: Erythropoietin activity, required for erythropoiesis, is not restricted to the erythroid lineage. In light of reports on the metabolic effects of erythropoietin, we examined the effect of erythropoietin signaling on skeletal muscle fiber type development. Skeletal muscles that are rich in slow twitch fibers are associated with increased mitochondrial oxidative activity and corresponding expression of related genes compared to muscle rich in fast twitch fibers. Although erythropoietin receptor is expressed on muscle progenitor/precursor cells and is down regulated in mature muscle fibers, we found that skeletal muscles from mice with high erythropoietin production in vivo exhibit an increase in the proportion of slow twitch myofibers and increased mitochondrial activity. In comparison, skeletal muscle from wild type mice and mice with erythropoietin activity restricted to erythroid tissue have fewer slow twitch myofibers and reduced mitochondrial activity. PGC-1α activates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and converts the fast myofibers to slow myofibers when overexpressed in skeletal muscle and PGC-1α was elevated by 2-fold in mice with high erythropoietin. In vitro erythropoietin treatment of primary skeletal myoblasts increased mitochondrial biogenesis gene expression including PGC-1α by 2.6-fold, CytC by 2-fold, oxygen consumption rate by 2-fold, and citrate synthase activity by 58%. Erythropoietin also increases AMPK, which induces PGC-1α and stimulates slow oxidative fiber formation. These data suggest that erythropoietin contributes to skeletal muscle fiber programming and metabolism, and increases PGC-1α and AMPK activity during muscle development directly to affect the proportion of slow/fast twitch myofibers in mature skeletal muscle

Abstract: Organic solar cells are appealing with respect to their inorganic counterparts because the functional layers of these devices can be processed from solution with technologies such as inkjet printing. In order to be able to use inkjet printing on a large scale, hazardous, chlorinated solvents should be avoided when depositing the functional materials. In this work, a novel adapted absorber polymer was blended with fullerene and inkjet printing was used to deposit the blend films. A special emphasis was placed on finding a chlorine-free solvent system which delivers good device performance. A chlorine-free solvent system based on anisole and tetralin delivered efficiencies of 2.7% which compares to 3.5% for active layers that were printed from chlorinated solvents. A coarser phase separation was found with energy filtered transmission electron microscopy plasmon mapping which most likely resulted in the performance differences for the chlorinated and chlorine-free solvent systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate semi-transparent organic inverted photovoltaic cells integrating a transparent anode based on two different transparent materials poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS Clevios PH1000) and PH1000/Tungsten Oxide (WOx). Transparency of the device employing PH1000/WOx over the visible region is 40%, which is comparable to those without WOx. The performance of the semi-transparent device exhibited the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.72mA/cm2, filling factor (FF) of 55.8% along with 0.65V open-circuit voltage, leading to power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 2.45%. It is found that the device employing PH1000/WOx exhibited better stability compared to the cells with only PH1000 cathode.

Abstract: The comprehensive study of human pathologies has revealed the complexity of the interactions involved in cardiovascular physiology. The recent validation of system's biology approaches – like our Modular Control and Regulation Analysis (MoCA) – motivates the current interest for new integrative and non-invasive analyses that could be used for medical study of human heart contraction energetics. By considering heart energetics as a supply–demand system, MoCA gives access to integrated organ function and brings out a new type of information, the “elasticities”, which describe in situ the regulation of both energy demand and supply by cellular energetic status. These regulations determine the internal control of contraction energetics and may therefore be a key to the understanding of the links between molecular events in pathologies and whole organ function/dysfunction. A wider application to the effects of cardiac drugs in conjunction with the direct study of heart pathologies may be considered in the near future. MoCA can potentially be used not only to detect the origin of the defects associated with the pathology (elasticity analyses), but also to provide a quantitative description of how these defects influence global heart function (regulation analysis) and therefore open new therapeutic perspectives. Several key examples of current applications to intact isolated beating heart are presented in this paper. The future application to human pathologies will require the use of non-invasive NMR techniques for the simultaneous measurement of energy status (31P NMR) and heart contractile activity (3D MRI).

Abstract: 2-Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (OGDHC) operates at a metabolic cross-road, mediating Ca2+- and ADP-dependent signals in mitochondria. Here, we test our hypothesis that OGDHC plays a major role in the neurotransmitter metabolism and associated stress response. This possibility was assessed using succinyl phosphonate (SP), a highly specific and efficient in vivo inhibitor of OGDHC. Animals exposed to toxicants (SP, ethanol or MnCl2), trauma or acute hypoxia showed intrinsic up-regulation of OGDHC in brain and heart. The known mechanism of the SP action as OGDHC inhibitor pointed to the up-regulation triggered by the enzyme impairment. The animal behavior and skeletal muscle or heart performance were tested to correlate physiology with the OGDHC regulation and associated changes in the glutamate and cellular energy status. The SP-treated animals exhibited interdependent changes in the brain OGDHC activity, glutamate level and cardiac autonomic balance, suggesting the neurotransmitter role of glutamate to be involved in the changed heart performance. Energy insufficiency after OGDHC inhibition was detectable neither in animals up to 25mg/kg SP, nor in cell culture during 24h incubation with 0.1mM SP. However, in animals subjected to acute ethanol intoxication SP did evoke energy deficit, decreasing muscular strength and locomotion and increasing the narcotic sleep duration. This correlated with the SP-induced decrease in NAD(P)H levels of the ethanol-exposed neurons. Thus, we show the existence of natural mechanisms to up-regulate mammalian OGDHC in response to stress, with both the glutamate neurotransmission and energy production potentially involved in the OGDHC impact on physiological performance.

Abstract: Carbon nanoparticle loaded TiO2 (CNP-TiO2) was successfully synthesized by the sonochemical method. The catalyst was characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM, DRS, Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), CV and BET surface area measurements. XPS analysis reveals the presence of carbon nanoparticles in CNP-TiO2. A decrease of photoluminescence intensity of CNP-TiO2 when compared to TiO2 indicates the suppression of electron–hole recombination by the loaded carbon nano-particles. The photocatalytic activity of CNP-TiO2 for degradation of Reactive Red 120 using solar light is higher than TiO2-P25 and prepared TiO2. A dual mechanism involving electron–hole separation by CNP and dye sensitization is proposed for the degradation. CNP-TiO2 is also found to be stable and reusable.

Abstract: We investigated the effect of myriocin treatment, which extensively depletes sphingolipids from cells, on multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) efflux activity in MRP1 expressing cells and isolated plasma membrane vesicles. Our data reveal that both short term (3 days) and long term (7 days) treatment effectively reduce the cellular sphingolipid content to the same level. Intriguingly, a two-fold increase in MRP1-mediated efflux activity was observed following long term treatment, while short term treatment had no impact. Very similar data were obtained with plasma membrane vesicles isolated from myriocin-treated cells. Exploiting the cell-free vesicle system, Michaelis–Menten analysis revealed that the intrinsic MRP1 activity remained unaltered; however, the fraction of active transporter molecules increased. We demonstrate that the latter effect is due to an enhanced recruitment of MRP1 into lipid raft fractions, thereby promoting MRP1 activity.

Abstract: With the goal of applying them in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), in this study we synthesized two organometallic alternating conjugated polymers, TPT–TPyPt and TPT–TIqPt, consisting of indacenodithiophene (thiophene/phenylene/thiophene; TPT) and cyclometalated platinum(II) moieties and compared their optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties, their space charge limited currents, and their structures (density functional theory) with those of related platinum-free organic polymers, TPT–TPy and TPT–TIq. The absorption bands of the metal-based polymers were significantly red-shifted relative to those of the metal-free polymers. We fabricated OPVs incorporating blends of these polymers and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester at various weight ratios. One of these devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.9%, with a short-circuit current density of 7.7mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.78V, and a fill factor of 0.48, under AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is the highest reported for a PSC based on a cyclometalated platinum-type polymer.

Abstract: Prolyl oligopeptidase is a serine protease that cleaves peptides shorter 30-mer at carboxyl side of an internal proline. This enzyme has been proposed to be involved in the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides. However, conclusive results have not yet been reported, and the primary physiological role remains to be elucidated. Here, we describe the identification of a novel protein that interacts with prolyl oligopeptidase in a human neuroblastoma cell line NB-1. Using an affinity column with immobilized recombinant human prolyl oligopeptidase as ligand, we identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a novel prolyl oligopeptidase binding protein in NB-1 cell extracts. The interaction between prolyl oligopeptidase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was confirmed by immunoprecipitation both in vitro and in vivo. To study the functional relevance of prolyl oligopeptidase–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase interactions, we investigated whether this interaction was involved in cytosine arabinoside-induced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase nuclear translocation and cell death. Prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor, SUAM-14746, and prolyl oligopeptidase knockdown successfully inhibited glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase translocation and promoted the survival of cytosine arabinoside-treated NB-1 cells. We also found that the interactions between prolyl oligopeptidase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the cytoplasm but not in nuclei of NB-1 cell treated with cytosine arabinoside using an in situ proximity ligation assay. These results indicate that the interaction between prolyl oligopeptidase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is required for cytosine arabinoside-induced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase nuclear translocation and cell death. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrate a novel function for prolyl oligopeptidase in cell death.

Abstract: Mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase is an enzymatic complex involved in the aerobic synthesis of ATP. It is well known that several enzymes are organized in supramolecular complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ATP synthase supramolecular assembly is mediated through two interfaces. One leads to dimer formation and the other to oligomer formation. In yeast, the presence of ATP synthase oligomers has been described as essential to the maintenance of the mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure. Indeed, the destabilization of the interactions between monomers was shown to alter the organization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, leading to the formation of onion-like structures similar to those observed in some mitochondrial pathologies. By using information obtained this decade (structure modeling, electron microscopy and cross-linking), this paper (i) reviews the actual state of the art and (ii) proposes a topological model of the transmembrane domains and interfaces of the ATP synthase's tetramer. This review also discusses the physiological role of this oligomerization process and its potential implications in mammal pathology.

Abstract: We herein report on the improved performance of inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) that consist of a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic (PV) layer with a water-processable electron-collecting interlayer of a hybrid poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) compound. For the BHJ PV layers of poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM), we found that the introduction of a solution-processed hybrid PEO:Cs2CO3 interlayer dramatically enhanced the performance of the cells, resulting in improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.8% for the inverted PSCs on glass substrates. These improvements may be attributed to a reduction in the work function of the ITO cathode together with the dual functions of electron-selective/hole-blocking effects of the PEO:Cs2CO3 interlayer. Moreover, the influence of the introduction of the PEO:Cs2CO3 interlayer on device performance was also examined even for flexible inverted PSCs on plastic substrates, and a high PCE of 2.8% was obtained for these inverted structures. The use of this approach in the design of electron-collecting interlayers in flexible inverted PSC structures could be of considerable benefit in the future development of all-solution- and roll-to-roll processed PSCs.

Abstract: Organic solar cells exhibit potential to provide light-weight and low-cost solar energy on flexible substrates. However, current efficiency is still low for applications. New materials and device designs are needed to increase cell efficiency and make this technology available for large-scale applications. The dependence of double junction solar cell efficiency on polymer bandgaps in top and bottom subcells are presented, which provides guidance for engineering new conjugated polymers for efficient photovoltaic device development. The achievable cell efficiency can be beyond 16% with the bandgap of the bottom subcell at ∼1.6eV (∼775nm) and that of the top subcell at ∼1eV (∼1240nm). In addition, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the donor polymers are provided depending on various acceptor materials such as PCBM, TiO2, ZnO and CdSe. The interfacial layers between the subcells in double junction organic devices are also discussed.

Abstract: The influence of emitter size on the fuel to electrical conversion efficiency in thermo-photovoltaic generators is investigated. Based on simple and reasonable physical assumptions such as a black body emitter and thermal equilibrium between emitter and exhaust gases we evaluate the electrical efficiency as a function of the emitter area for thermo-photovoltaic generators equipped with Ge, GaSb and Si photovoltaic cells. It is found that for a given thermal energy introduced there are optimal values of the emitter surface which maximize the generator efficiency. The corresponding values of energy per unit area of the emitter are higher than in the realized prototypes. This suggests that it is possible to obtain more efficient thermo-photoconverters with reduced emitter and photovoltaic cell area.

Abstract: Muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity measured ex vivo provides a physiological reference to assess cellular oxidative capacity as a component in the oxygen cascade in vivo. In this article, the magnitude of muscle blood flow and oxygen uptake during exercise involving a small-to-large fraction of the body mass will be discussed in relation to mitochondrial capacity measured ex vivo. These analyses reveal that as the mass of muscle engaged in exercise increases from one-leg knee extension, to 2-arm cranking, to 2-leg cycling and x-country skiing, the magnitude of blood flow and oxygen delivery decrease. Accordingly, a 2-fold higher oxygen delivery and oxygen uptake per unit muscle mass are seen in vivo during 1-leg exercise compared to 2-leg cycling indicating a significant limitation of the circulation during exercise with a large muscle mass. This analysis also reveals that mitochondrial capacity measured ex vivo underestimates the maximal in vivo oxygen uptake of muscle by up to ∼2-fold.

Abstract: In the 1920s, Otto Warburg first hypothesized that mitochondrial impairment is a leading cause of cancer although he recognized the existence of oxidative tumors. Likewise, Weinhouse and others in the 50s found that deficient mitochondrial respiration is not an obligatory feature of cancer and Peter Vaupel suggested in the 1990s that tumor oxygenation rather than OXPHOS capacity was the limiting factor of mitochondrial energy production in cancer. Recent studies now clearly indicate that mitochondria are highly functional in mice tumors and the field of oncobioenergetic identified MYC, Oct1 and RAS as pro-OXPHOS oncogenes. In addition, cancer cells adaptation to aglycemia, metabolic symbiosis between hypoxic and non-hypoxic tumor regions as well the reverse Warburg hypothesis support the crucial role of mitochondria in the survival of a subclass of tumors. Therefore, mitochondria are now considered as potential targets for anti-cancer therapy and tentative strategies including a bioenergetic profile characterization of the tumor and the subsequent adapted bioenergetic modulation could be considered for cancer killing. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

Abstract: We demonstrate the efficiency improvement of hybrid solar cells based on silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and organic materials. This progress is readily achieved by acid treatments of SiNWs. Tin (Sn) catalyzed SiNWs contain residual Sn and Sn oxide drops on their top which are deleterious for a solar cell performance. Removal of this Sn and Sn oxide contamination is performed with hydrochloric acid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement verified that the amount of Sn and Sn oxide on SiNWs array is decreased according to the immersing time. This brings open-circuit voltage and shunt resistance increase thus the hybrid solar cell performance is improved. Light intensity dependent open-circuit voltage clearly reveals that this efficiency improvement results from a reduced trap-assisted recombination through Sn and Sn oxide. In addition to the residual catalysts removal, native oxide removal by hydrofluoric acid also considerably contributes to further improvement in terms of short-circuit current and fill factor. Clearly, the improvement of SiNWs quality is essential for an optimization of hybrid solar cell performance.

Abstract: p66Shc is an adaptor protein involved in cell proliferation and differentiation that undergoes phosphorylation at Ser36 in response to oxidative stimuli, consequently inducing a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial disruption and apoptosis. Its role during several pathologies suggests that p66Shc mitochondrial signalling can perpetuate a primary mitochondrial defect, thus contributing to the pathophysiology of that condition. Here, we show that in the fibroblasts of neuropathy, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) patients, the p66Shc phosphorylation pathway is significantly induced in response to intracellular oxidative stress related to disrupted ATP synthase activity and mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarisation. We postulate that the increased phosphorylation of p66Shc at Ser36 is partially responsible for further increasing ROS production, resulting in oxidative damage of proteins. Oxidative stress and p66Shc phosphorylation at Ser36 may be mitigated by antioxidant administration or the use of a p66Shc phosphorylation inhibitor.

Abstract: We report a sub-100nm scale polymer transfer printing (NPTP) method that provides a low temperature, high-throughput patterning process for the fabrication of a nanopatterned bilayer organic solar cell (OSC) of poly(3-hexyltiophene) and 1-(3-methoxycabonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61. Utilization of a UV-curable polymer stamp and a proper solvent successfully fabricated OSCs with sub-100nm patterns by direct NPTP. We believe that the proposed NPTP process will prove very useful for nano-scale patterning in various organic devices such as OSCs, OLEDs, OTFTs, and others.

Abstract: We report on the theoretical investigation of a silicon-based interdigitated back contact back heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell that combines the advantages of heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) solar cell and point contact back junction c-Si solar cell. Our results show an optimum bandgap for emitter (p-type a-Si:H) layer for this cell to be approximately 1.72eV. As we increase the bandgap from 1.3eV to 2.2eV, the open circuit voltage (Voc) increases from 0.45V to 0.75V and then saturates, while the short circuit current density (Jsc) remains constant at 35mA/cm2 up to about 2.0eV, and then decreases to zero. Fill factor (FF) increases from 57% to a maximum of 75% as the bandgap increases from 1.3eV to ∼1.72eV, respectively, and then decrease to 5% when the bandgap reaches 2.1eV. Efficiency increases from 7% and reaches a maximum of about 19% at around 1.7eV and then decreases to zero at 2.1eV. These results can be correlated to changes in valance band spike (barrier) when emitter bandgap increases from 1.3eV to 2.2eV, and are explained in terms of band alignment between p-a-Si:H/i-a-Si:H/n-type-c-Si.

Abstract: A series of low band gap polymers composed of benzotriazole and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene derivatives were synthesized using a Stille cross-coupling reaction for use in organic photovoltaic devices. Linear or branched alkyl groups were incorporated into the benzothiazole-based accepting monomer part, and alkoxy or alkylthiophene groups were introduced to benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-based donating monomer part. Changes in photo-physical properties of the polymers by the structural modification of the donor–acceptor type low band gap polymers were investigated. The synthesized polymers were soluble in common organic solvents, and the resulting polymer solutions could be used to form smooth and uniform thin films by spin-casting. The synthesized polymers were found to exhibit good thermal stability, losing less than 5% of their weight upon heating to approximately 300°C. The intra-molecular charge transfer interaction between the electron donating and electron accepting blocks in the polymeric backbone induced a broad absorption from 300 to 650nm. The optical band gap energies of the polymers were measured to be 2.03–1.90eV depending on the polymer structure. Solution-processed field-effect transistors were fabricated and characterized using the polymers as p-type channel materials. Bulk hetero-junction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using the polymers with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor. One of the fabricated device showed the maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.20% under AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) conditions.

Abstract: The degradation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) exposed to ultra-violet (UV) light, heat, and humidity is examined using a variety of materials characterization techniques. Using contemporary material formulations, some of which are specifically marketed to the PV industry, techniques were identified that can readily discern material changes in PMMA degraded by artificial weathering. Separate PMMA formulations were categorized as “hazy” or “yellow”, based on their visual appearance after 18 cumulative months of indoor aging in an environmental chamber equipped with a xenon-arc lamp. The characteristics examined included: optical transmittance (and the corresponding yellowness index); surface roughness (examined via atomic force and scanning electron microscopy); surface chemistry (via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy); elastic modulus and mechanical hardness (via nanoindentation); thermal decomposition (via thermogravimetric analysis); bulk chemistry (via nuclear magnetic resonance); molecular weight (via gel permeation chromatography); and optical fluorescence. The comparison between the most affected “hazy” and “yellow” specimens illustrates some of the ways these measurement techniques can be used to explore changes in application-critical characteristics and mechanisms involved in material degradation.

Abstract: Novel thin films of dye-doped parylene were produced by a deposition technique consisting in a coarse vacuum co-sublimation of parylene C dimer and the perylenediimide dye Lumogen® F Red 305 (LR). In order to obtain parylene films containing different dye concentrations, LR was sublimated at temperatures ranging from 290°C to 330°C. The deposited films were characterized by FT-IR analysis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical absorption and emission spectroscopy. FT-IR analysis shows that LR is embedded in the parylene matrix, whose properties are not significantly affected by the dye incorporation. AFM analyses highlight the very low roughness of the deposited films, which is particularly important for optical applications, where light scattering at the air/film interface must be minimized. The optical properties of LR are preserved in the deposited films and the films exhibit the typical red light emission around 600nm. No concentration quenching effects are found even at the highest LR concentrations obtained in this work, thus confirming the capability of the co-sublimation technique to obtain finely dispersed dye-containing films. Thin film luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) were also produced by depositing LR-containing parylene films on glass and polymer waveguides and their properties were tested by measuring the output power of different solar cells coupled to one edge of the waveguide. Optical efficiency and power conversion efficiency of the LSC-based systems were then measured.

Abstract: Electroluminescence measured at different injection current densities is used to study the effect of particle irradiation on GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells. By employing the optoelectronic reciprocity relation, the irradiation-induced degradation in the J–V characteristics of all individual subcells and their underlying diode saturation parameters is derived. Also, the dependence of the solar cell irradiation response on the position of the irradiation-induced non-radiative recombination centers within the cell active region, i.e., the quasi-neutral regions and the space charge region, is discussed.

Abstract: Toxic aldehydes produced by alcohol dehydrogenases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori-related damage to the gastric mucosa. Despite this, the enzymes that might be responsible for producing such aldehydes have not been fully described. It was, therefore, of considerable interest to characterize the alcohol oxidizing enzymes in this pathogen. Previous work in this laboratory characterized two such H. pylori enzymes that had broad specificity for a range of aromatic alcohol substrates. However, an enzyme with specificity for aliphatic alcohols is likely to be required in order that H. pylori can metabolize the wide range of substrates encountered in the gastric mucosa. In this study we describe HpSCADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from H. pylori 26695 with broad specificity for aliphatic alcohols. HpSCADH was classified in the cD1e subfamily of classical short chain alcohol dehydrogenases. The enzyme was a monomer of approximately 29kDa with a preference for NAD+ as cofactor. Pyrazole was found to be a competitive inhibitor of HpSCADH. The physiological role of this enzyme was explored by construction of an HpSCADH isogenic mutant. At pH 7.0 the mutant showed reduced growth which became more pronounced when the pH was lowered to 5.0. When pyrazole was added to wild type H. pylori cells it caused growth profiles to be reduced to match those of the isogenic mutant suggesting that HpSCADH inhibition alone was responsible for growth impairment. Taken together, the data relating to the alcohol metabolizing enzymes of this pathogen indicate that they play an important role in H. pylori growth and adaptation to acidic environments. The therapeutic potential of targeting H. pylori alcohol dehydrogenases is discussed.
