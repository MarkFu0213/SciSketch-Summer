Abstract: Summary
The expansion of autophagosomes requires a controlled association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the mechanisms governing this process are not well defined. In plants, ATG18a plays a key role in autophagosome formation in response to stress, yet the factors regulating the process are unknown. This study finds that ATG18a acts as a downstream effector of RABC1, a member of the poorly characterized Rab18/RabC GTPase subclass in plants. Active RABC1 interacts with ATG18a on the ER, particularly under nutrient starvation. In rabc1 mutants, autophagy is compromised, especially under nutrient deprivation, affecting the ER association and expansion of ATG18a-positive autophagosomes. Furthermore, both dominant-negative and constitutively active RABC1 forms inhibit autophagy. The dominant inactive RABC1 impedes the ER association of ATG18a, whereas the constitutively active RABC1 delays ATG18a detachment from the ER. Collectively, RABC1 regulates the ER association and the subsequent detachment of ATG18a-positive autophagosomes during nutrient starvation.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at lysine 164 (K164) activates DNA damage tolerance pathways. Currently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how PCNA K164 ubiquitination promotes genome stability. To evaluate this, we generated stable cell lines expressing PCNAK164R from the endogenous PCNA locus. Our data reveal that the inability to ubiquitinate K164 causes perturbations in global DNA replication. Persistent replication stress generates under-replicated regions and is exacerbated by the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. We show that these phenotypes are due, in part, to impaired Fanconi anemia group D2 protein (FANCD2)-dependent mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) in PCNAK164R cells. FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination is significantly reduced in PCNAK164R mutants, leading to reduced chromatin association and foci formation, both prerequisites for FANCD2-dependent MiDAS. Furthermore, K164 ubiquitination coordinates direct PCNA/FANCD2 colocalization in mitotic nuclei. Here, we show that PCNA K164 ubiquitination maintains human genome stability by promoting FANCD2-dependent MiDAS to prevent the accumulation of under-replicated DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer due to its propensity to metastasize. It arises from melanocytes, which are attached to keratinocytes within the basal epidermis. Here, we hypothesize that, in addition to melanocyte-intrinsic modifications, dysregulation of keratinocyte functions could initiate early-stage melanoma cell invasion. We identified the lysolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) as a tumor paracrine signal from melanoma cells that modifies the keratinocyte transcriptome and reduces their adhesive properties, leading to tumor invasion. Mechanistically, tumor cell-derived S1P reduced E-cadherin expression in keratinocytes via S1P receptor dependent Snail and Slug activation. All of these effects were blocked by S1P2/3 antagonists. Importantly, we showed that epidermal E-cadherin expression was inversely correlated with the expression of the S1P-producing enzyme in neighboring tumors and the Breslow thickness in patients with early-stage melanoma. These findings support the notion that E-cadherin loss in the epidermis initiates the metastatic cascade in melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
The carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are closely related to viral infection and intestinal bacteria. However, little is known about bacteria within the HCC tumor microenvironment. Here, we showed that intratumoral Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) promoted the initiation and progression of HCC by enhancing nuclear ploidy. We quantified M. hyorhinis in clinical tissue specimens of HCC and observed that patients with high M. hyorhinis load had poor prognosis. We found that gastrointestinal M. hyorhinis can retrogradely infect the liver through the oral-duodenal-hepatopancreatic ampulla route. We further found that the increases in mononuclear polyploidy and cancer stemness resulted from mitochondrial fission caused by intracellular M. hyorhinis. Mechanistically, M. hyorhinis infection promoted the decay of mitochondrial fusion protein (MFN) 1 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner. Our findings indicated that M. hyorhinis infection promoted pathological polyploidization and suggested that Mycoplasma clearance with antibiotics or regulating mitochondrial dynamics might have the potential for HCC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acids are required for cell growth and proliferation, but it remains unclear when and how amino acid availability impinges on the proliferation-quiescence decision. Here, we used time-lapse microscopy and single-cell tracking of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity to assess the response of individual cells to withdrawal of single amino acids and found strikingly different cell-cycle effects depending on the amino acid. For example, upon leucine withdrawal, MCF10A cells complete two cell cycles and then enter a CDK2-low quiescence, whereas lysine withdrawal causes immediate cell-cycle stalling. Methionine withdrawal triggers a restriction point phenotype similar to serum starvation or Mek inhibition: upon methionine withdrawal, cells complete their current cell cycle and enter a CDK2-low quiescence after mitosis. Modulation of restriction point regulators p21/p27 or cyclin D1 enables short-term rescue of proliferation under methionine and leucine withdrawal, and to a lesser extent lysine withdrawal, revealing a checkpoint connecting nutrient signaling to cell-cycle entry.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamus regulates innate social behaviors, including mating and aggression. These behaviors can be evoked by optogenetic stimulation of specific neuronal subpopulations within MPOA and VMHvl, respectively. Here, we perform dynamical systems modeling of population neuronal activity in these nuclei during social behaviors. In VMHvl, unsupervised analysis identified a dominant dimension of neural activity with a large time constant (>50 s), generating an approximate line attractor in neural state space. Progression of the neural trajectory along this attractor was correlated with an escalation of agonistic behavior, suggesting that it may encode a scalable state of aggressiveness. Consistent with this, individual differences in the magnitude of the integration dimension time constant were strongly correlated with differences in aggressiveness. In contrast, approximate line attractors were not observed in MPOA during mating; instead, neurons with fast dynamics were tuned to specific actions. Thus, different hypothalamic nuclei employ distinct neural population codes to represent similar social behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Downward social mobility is a well-known mental risk factor for depression, but its neural mechanism remains elusive. Here, by forcing mice to lose against their subordinates in a non-violent social contest, we lower their social ranks stably and induce depressive-like behaviors. These rank-decline-associated depressive-like behaviors can be reversed by regaining social status. In vivo fiber photometry and single-unit electrophysiological recording show that forced loss, but not natural loss, generates negative reward prediction error (RPE). Through the lateral hypothalamus, the RPE strongly activates the brain’s anti-reward center, the lateral habenula (LHb). LHb activation inhibits the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that controls social competitiveness and reinforces retreats in contests. These results reveal the core neural mechanisms mutually promoting social status loss and depressive behaviors. The intertwined neuronal signaling controlling mPFC and LHb activities provides a mechanistic foundation for the crosstalk between social mobility and psychological disorder, unveiling a promising target for intervention.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS mutations are frequently detected in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Although covalent KRASG12C inhibitors have been developed to treat KRASG12C-mutant cancers, effective treatments are still lacking for other KRAS-mutant NSCLCs. Thus, identifying a KRAS effector that confers poor prognosis would provide an alternative strategy for the treatment of KRAS-driven cancers. Here, we show that KRAS drives expression of deubiquitinase USP13 through Ras-responsive element-binding protein 1 (RREB1). Elevated USP13 promotes KRAS-mutant NSCLC metastasis, which is associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Mechanistically, USP13 interacts with and removes the K63-linked polyubiquitination of β-catenin at lysine 508, which enhances the binding between β-catenin and transcription factor TCF4. Importantly, we identify 2-methoxyestradiol as an effective inhibitor for USP13 from a natural compound library, and it could potently suppress the metastasis of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify USP13 as a therapeutic target for metastatic NSCLC with KRAS mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Using four-dimensional whole-embryo light sheet imaging with improved and accessible computational tools, we longitudinally reconstruct early murine cardiac development at single-cell resolution. Nascent mesoderm progenitors form opposing density and motility gradients, converting the temporal birth sequence of gastrulation into a spatial anterolateral-to-posteromedial arrangement. Migrating precardiac mesoderm does not strictly preserve cellular neighbor relationships, and spatial patterns only become solidified as the cardiac crescent emerges. Progenitors undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, with a first heart field (FHF) ridge apposing a motile juxta-cardiac field (JCF). Anchored along the ridge, the FHF epithelium rotates the JCF forward to form the initial heart tube, along with push-pull morphodynamics of the second heart field. In Mesp1 mutants that fail to make a cardiac crescent, mesoderm remains highly motile but directionally incoherent, resulting in density gradient inversion. Our practicable live embryo imaging approach defines spatial origins and behaviors of cardiac progenitors and identifies their unanticipated morphological transitions.

Abstract: Summary
Low-grade chronic inflammation is a hallmark of ageing, associated with impaired tissue function and disease development. However, how cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors collectively establish this phenotype, termed inflammaging, remains poorly understood. We addressed this question in the mouse intestinal epithelium, using mouse organoid cultures to dissect stem cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic sources of inflammaging. At the single-cell level, we found that inflammaging is established differently along the crypt-villus axis, with aged intestinal stem cells (ISCs) strongly upregulating major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes. Importantly, the inflammaging phenotype was stably propagated by aged ISCs in organoid cultures and associated with increased chromatin accessibility at inflammation-associated loci in vivo and ex vivo, indicating cell-intrinsic inflammatory memory. Mechanistically, we show that the expression of inflammatory genes is dependent on STAT1 signaling. Together, our data identify that intestinal inflammaging in mice is promoted by a cell-intrinsic mechanism, stably propagated by ISCs, and associated with a disbalance in immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Complex diseases often involve the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 neuropathies (CMT2) are a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders, in which similar peripheral neuropathology is inexplicably caused by various mutated genes. Their possible molecular links remain elusive. Here, we found that upon environmental stress, many CMT2-causing mutant proteins adopt similar properties by entering stress granules (SGs), where they aberrantly interact with G3BP and integrate into SG pathways. For example, glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) is translocated from the cytoplasm into SGs upon stress, where the mutant GlyRS perturbs the G3BP-centric SG network by aberrantly binding to G3BP. This disrupts SG-mediated stress responses, leading to increased stress vulnerability in motoneurons. Disrupting this aberrant interaction rescues SG abnormalities and alleviates motor deficits in CMT2D mice. These findings reveal a stress-dependent molecular link across diverse CMT2 mutants and provide a conceptual framework for understanding genetic heterogeneity in light of environmental stress.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoproteins L1 and L3 (APOLs) are associated at the Golgi with the membrane fission factors phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-IIIB (PI4KB) and non-muscular myosin 2A. Either APOL1 C-terminal truncation (APOL1Δ) or APOL3 deletion (APOL3-KO [knockout]) reduces PI4KB activity and triggers actomyosin reorganization. We report that APOL3, but not APOL1, controls PI4KB activity through interaction with PI4KB and neuronal calcium sensor-1 or calneuron-1. Both APOLs are present in Golgi-derived autophagy-related protein 9A vesicles, which are involved in PI4KB trafficking. Like APOL3-KO, APOL1Δ induces PI4KB dissociation from APOL3, linked to reduction of mitophagy flux and production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. APOL1 and APOL3, respectively, can interact with the mitophagy receptor prohibitin-2 and the mitophagosome membrane fusion factor vesicle-associated membrane protein-8 (VAMP8). While APOL1 conditions PI4KB and APOL3 involvement in mitochondrion fission and mitophagy, APOL3-VAMP8 interaction promotes fusion between mitophagosomal and endolysosomal membranes. We propose that APOL3 controls mitochondrial membrane dynamics through interactions with the fission factor PI4KB and the fusion factor VAMP8.

Abstract: Summary
Concomitant with DNA replication, the chromosomal cohesin complex establishes cohesion between newly replicated sister chromatids. Cohesion establishment requires acetylation of conserved cohesin lysine residues by Eco1 acetyltransferase. Here, we explore how cohesin acetylation is linked to DNA replication. Biochemical reconstitution of replication-coupled cohesin acetylation reveals that transient DNA structures, which form during DNA replication, control the acetylation reaction. As polymerases complete lagging strand replication, strand displacement synthesis produces DNA flaps that are trimmed to result in nicked double-stranded DNA. Both flaps and nicks stimulate cohesin acetylation, while subsequent nick ligation to complete Okazaki fragment maturation terminates the acetylation reaction. A flapped or nicked DNA substrate constitutes a transient molecular clue that directs cohesin acetylation to a window behind the replication fork, next to where cohesin likely entraps both sister chromatids. Our results provide an explanation for how DNA replication is linked to sister chromatid cohesion establishment.

Abstract: Summary
Precise targeting of large transgenes to T cells using homology-directed repair has been transformative for adoptive cell therapies and T cell biology. Delivery of DNA templates via adeno-associated virus (AAV) has greatly improved knockin efficiencies, but the tropism of current AAV serotypes restricts their use to human T cells employed in immunodeficient mouse models. To enable targeted knockins in murine T cells, we evolved Ark313, a synthetic AAV that exhibits high transduction efficiency in murine T cells. We performed a genome-wide knockout screen and identified QA2 as an essential factor for Ark313 infection. We demonstrate that Ark313 can be used for nucleofection-free DNA delivery, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts, and targeted integration of large transgenes. Ark313 enables preclinical modeling of Trac-targeted CAR-T and transgenic TCR-T cells in immunocompetent models. Efficient gene targeting in murine T cells holds great potential for improved cell therapies and opens avenues in experimental T cell immunology.

Abstract: Summary
Immunogen design approaches aim to control the specificity and quality of antibody responses elicited by next-generation vaccines. Here, we use computational protein design to generate a nanoparticle vaccine platform based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) that enables precise control of antigen conformation and spacing. HA RBDs are presented as either monomers or native-like closed trimers that are connected to the underlying nanoparticle by a rigid linker that is modularly extended to precisely control antigen spacing. Nanoparticle immunogens with decreased spacing between trimeric RBDs elicit antibodies with improved hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization potency as well as binding breadth across diverse H1 HAs. Our “trihead” nanoparticle immunogen platform provides insights into anti-HA immunity, establishes antigen spacing as an important parameter in structure-based vaccine design, and embodies several design features that could be used in next-generation vaccines against influenza and other viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Horizontal gene transfer accelerates microbial evolution. The marine picocyanobacterium Prochlorococcus exhibits high genomic plasticity, yet the underlying mechanisms are elusive. Here, we report a novel family of DNA transposons—“tycheposons”—some of which are viral satellites while others carry cargo, such as nutrient-acquisition genes, which shape the genetic variability in this globally abundant genus. Tycheposons share distinctive mobile-lifecycle-linked hallmark genes, including a deep-branching site-specific tyrosine recombinase. Their excision and integration at tRNA genes appear to drive the remodeling of genomic islands—key reservoirs for flexible genes in bacteria. In a selection experiment, tycheposons harboring a nitrate assimilation cassette were dynamically gained and lost, thereby promoting chromosomal rearrangements and host adaptation. Vesicles and phage particles harvested from seawater are enriched in tycheposons, providing a means for their dispersal in the wild. Similar elements are found in microbes co-occurring with Prochlorococcus, suggesting a common mechanism for microbial diversification in the vast oligotrophic oceans.

Abstract: Summary
Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) mediated by stromal interacting molecule (STIM)-gated ORAI channels at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) contact sites maintains adequate levels of Ca2+ within the ER lumen during Ca2+ signaling. Disruption of ER Ca2+ homeostasis activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore proteostasis. Here, we report that the UPR transducer inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) interacts with STIM1, promotes ER-PM contact sites, and enhances SOCE. IRE1 deficiency reduces T cell activation and human myoblast differentiation. In turn, STIM1 deficiency reduces IRE1 signaling after store depletion. Using a CaMPARI2-based Ca2+ genome-wide screen, we identify CAMKG2 and slc105a as SOCE enhancers during ER stress. Our findings unveil a direct crosstalk between SOCE and UPR via IRE1, acting as key regulator of ER Ca2+ and proteostasis in T cells and muscles. Under ER stress, this IRE1-STIM1 axis boosts SOCE to preserve immune cell functions, a pathway that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease caused by different mutations. Previously, we showed that each mutational subtype develops its specific gene regulatory network (GRN) with transcription factors interacting within multiple gene modules, many of which are transcription factor genes themselves. Here, we hypothesize that highly connected nodes within such networks comprise crucial regulators of AML maintenance. We test this hypothesis using FLT3-ITD-mutated AML as a model and conduct an shRNA drop-out screen informed by this analysis. We show that AML-specific GRNs predict crucial regulatory modules required for AML growth. Furthermore, our work shows that all modules are highly connected and regulate each other. The careful multi-omic analysis of the role of one (RUNX1) module by shRNA and chemical inhibition shows that this transcription factor and its target genes stabilize the GRN of FLT3-ITD+ AML and that its removal leads to GRN collapse and cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene programs, thereby controlling diverse cellular processes and cell states. To comprehensively understand TFs and the programs they control, we created a barcoded library of all annotated human TF splice isoforms (>3,500) and applied it to build a TF Atlas charting expression profiles of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) overexpressing each TF at single-cell resolution. We mapped TF-induced expression profiles to reference cell types and validated candidate TFs for generation of diverse cell types, spanning all three germ layers and trophoblasts. Targeted screens with subsets of the library allowed us to create a tailored cellular disease model and integrate mRNA expression and chromatin accessibility data to identify downstream regulators. Finally, we characterized the effects of combinatorial TF overexpression by developing and validating a strategy for predicting combinations of TFs that produce target expression profiles matching reference cell types to accelerate cellular engineering efforts.

Abstract: Summary
The diversity and complex organization of cells in the brain have hindered systematic characterization of age-related changes in its cellular and molecular architecture, limiting our ability to understand the mechanisms underlying its functional decline during aging. Here, we generated a high-resolution cell atlas of brain aging within the frontal cortex and striatum using spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics and quantified changes in gene expression and spatial organization of major cell types in these regions over the mouse lifespan. We observed substantially more pronounced changes in cell state, gene expression, and spatial organization of non-neuronal cells over neurons. Our data revealed molecular and spatial signatures of glial and immune cell activation during aging, particularly enriched in the subcortical white matter, and identified both similarities and notable differences in cell-activation patterns induced by aging and systemic inflammatory challenge. These results provide critical insights into age-related decline and inflammation in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease with limited treatment options. To characterize TNBC heterogeneity, we defined transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic subtypes and subtype-driving super-enhancers and transcription factors by combining functional and molecular profiling with computational analyses. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed relative homogeneity of the major transcriptional subtypes (luminal, basal, and mesenchymal) within samples. We found that mesenchymal TNBCs share features with mesenchymal neuroblastoma and rhabdoid tumors and that the PRRX1 transcription factor is a key driver of these tumors. PRRX1 is sufficient for inducing mesenchymal features in basal but not in luminal TNBC cells via reprogramming super-enhancer landscapes, but it is not required for mesenchymal state maintenance or for cellular viability. Our comprehensive, large-scale, multiplatform, multiomics study of both experimental and clinical TNBC is an important resource for the scientific and clinical research communities and opens venues for future investigation.

Abstract: Summary
A central factor in the maintenance of tissue integrity is the response of stem cells to variations in the levels of niche signals. In the gut, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) depend on Wnt ligands for self-renewal and proliferation. Transient increases in Wnt signaling promote regeneration after injury or in inflammatory bowel diseases, whereas constitutive activation of this pathway leads to colorectal cancer. Here, we report that Discs large 1 (Dlg1), although dispensable for polarity and cellular turnover during intestinal homeostasis, is required for ISC survival in the context of increased Wnt signaling. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and genetic mouse models demonstrated that DLG1 regulates the cellular response to increased canonical Wnt ligands. This occurs via the transcriptional regulation of Arhgap31, a GTPase-activating protein that deactivates CDC42, an effector of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. These findings reveal a DLG1-ARHGAP31-CDC42 axis that is essential for the ISC response to increased niche Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 2 (LRP2 or megalin) is representative of the phylogenetically conserved subfamily of giant LDL receptor-related proteins, which function in endocytosis and are implicated in diseases of the kidney and brain. Here, we report high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of LRP2 isolated from mouse kidney, at extracellular and endosomal pH. The structures reveal LRP2 to be a molecular machine that adopts a conformation for ligand binding at the cell surface and for ligand shedding in the endosome. LRP2 forms a homodimer, the conformational transformation of which is governed by pH-sensitive sites at both homodimer and intra-protomer interfaces. A subset of LRP2 deleterious missense variants in humans appears to impair homodimer assembly. These observations lay the foundation for further understanding the function and mechanism of LDL receptors and implicate homodimerization as a conserved feature of the LRP receptor subfamily.

Abstract: Summary
A major challenge in understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution is interpreting the antigenic and functional effects of emerging mutations in the viral spike protein. Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning platform based on non-replicative pseudotyped lentiviruses that directly quantifies how large numbers of spike mutations impact antibody neutralization and pseudovirus infection. We apply this platform to produce libraries of the Omicron BA.1 and Delta spikes. These libraries each contain ∼7,000 distinct amino acid mutations in the context of up to ∼135,000 unique mutation combinations. We use these libraries to map escape mutations from neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain, N-terminal domain, and S2 subunit of spike. Overall, this work establishes a high-throughput and safe approach to measure how ∼105 combinations of mutations affect antibody neutralization and spike-mediated infection. Notably, the platform described here can be extended to the entry proteins of many other viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody responses are characterized by increasing affinity and diversity over time. Affinity maturation occurs in germinal centers by a mechanism that involves repeated cycles of somatic mutation and selection. How antibody responses diversify while also undergoing affinity maturation is not as well understood. Here, we examined germinal center (GC) dynamics by tracking B cell entry, division, somatic mutation, and specificity. Our experiments show that naive B cells continuously enter GCs where they compete for T cell help and undergo clonal expansion. Consistent with late entry, invaders carry fewer mutations but can contribute up to 30% or more of the cells in late-stage germinal centers. Notably, cells entering the germinal center at later stages of the reaction diversify the immune response by expressing receptors that show low affinity to the immunogen. Paradoxically, the affinity threshold for late GC entry is lowered in the presence of high-affinity antibodies.

Abstract: Neural induction by cell-cell signaling was discovered a century ago by the organizer transplantations of Spemann and Mangold in amphibians. Spemann later found that early dorsal blastopore lips induced heads and late organizers trunk-tail structures. Identifying region-specific organizer signals has been a driving force in the progress of animal biology. Head induction in the absence of trunk is designated archencephalic differentiation. Two specific head inducers, Cerberus and Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), that induce archencephalic brain but not trunk-tail structures have been described previously. However, whether these two signals interact with each other had not been studied to date and was the purpose of the present investigation. It was found that Cerberus, a multivalent growth factor antagonist that inhibits Nodal, BMP and Wnt signals, strongly cooperated with IGF2, a growth factor that provides a positive signal through tyrosine kinase IGF receptors that activate MAPK and other pathways. The ectopic archencephalic structures induced by the combination of Cerberus and IGF2 are of higher frequency and larger than either one alone. They contain brain, a cyclopic eye and multiple olfactory placodes, without trace of trunk structures such as notochord or somites. A dominant-negative secreted IGF receptor 1 blocked Cerberus activity, indicating that endogenous IGF signals are required for ectopic brain formation. In a sensitized embryonic system, in which embryos were depleted of β-catenin, IGF2 did not by itself induce neural tissue while in combination with Cerberus it greatly enhanced formation of circular brain structures expressing the anterior markers Otx2 and Rx2a, but not spinal cord or notochord markers. The main conclusion of this work is that IGF provides a positive signal initially uniformly expressed throughout the embryo that potentiates the effect of an organizer-specific negative signal mediated by Cerberus. The results are discussed in the context of the history of neural induction.

Abstract: Summary
Effective and precise mammalian transcriptome engineering technologies are needed to accelerate biological discovery and RNA therapeutics. Despite the promise of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases, their utility has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of guide RNA design rules and cellular toxicity resulting from off-target or collateral RNA cleavage. Here, we quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs and systematically evaluated seven machine learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm orthogonally validated across multiple human cell types. Deep learning model interpretation revealed preferred sequence motifs and secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified and screened 46 novel Cas13d orthologs, finding that DjCas13d achieves low cellular toxicity and high specificity—even when targeting abundant transcripts in sensitive cell types, including stem cells and neurons. Our Cas13d guide efficiency model was successfully generalized to DjCas13d, illustrating the power of combining machine learning with ortholog discovery to advance RNA targeting in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Germinal centers (GCs) form in secondary lymphoid organs in response to infection and immunization and are the source of affinity-matured B cells. The duration of GC reactions spans a wide range, and long-lasting GCs (LLGCs) are potentially a source of highly mutated B cells. We show that rather than consisting of continuously evolving B cell clones, LLGCs elicited by influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice are sustained by progressive replacement of founder clones by naive-derived invader B cells that do not detectably bind viral antigens. Rare founder clones that resist replacement for long periods are enriched in clones with heavily mutated immunoglobulins, including some with very high affinity for antigen, that can be recalled by boosting. Our findings reveal underappreciated aspects of the biology of LLGCs generated by respiratory virus infection and identify clonal replacement as a potential constraint on the development of highly mutated antibodies within these structures.

Abstract: Summary
The human embryo breaks symmetry to form the anterior-posterior axis of the body. As the embryo elongates along this axis, progenitors in the tail bud give rise to tissues that generate spinal cord, skeleton, and musculature. This raises the question of how the embryo achieves axial elongation and patterning. While ethics necessitate in vitro studies, the variability of organoid systems has hindered mechanistic insights. Here, we developed a bioengineering and machine learning framework that optimizes organoid symmetry breaking by tuning their spatial coupling. This framework enabled reproducible generation of axially elongating organoids, each possessing a tail bud and neural tube. We discovered that an excitable system composed of WNT/FGF signaling drives elongation by inducing a neuromesodermal progenitor-like signaling center. We discovered that instabilities in the excitable system are suppressed by secreted WNT inhibitors. Absence of these inhibitors led to ectopic tail buds and branches. Our results identify mechanisms governing stable human axial elongation.

Abstract: Summary
O-GlcNAc is a dynamic post-translational modification (PTM) that regulates protein functions. In studying the regulatory roles of O-GlcNAc, a major roadblock is the inability to change O-GlcNAcylation on a single protein at a time. Herein, we developed a dual RNA-aptamer-based approach that simultaneously targeted O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and β-catenin, the key transcription factor of the Wnt signaling pathway, to selectively increase O-GlcNAcylation of the latter without affecting other OGT substrates. Using the OGT/β-catenin dual-specificity aptamers, we found that O-GlcNAcylation of β-catenin stabilizes the protein by inhibiting its interaction with β-TrCP. O-GlcNAc also increases β-catenin’s interaction with EZH2, recruits EZH2 to promoters, and dramatically alters the transcriptome. Further, by coupling riboswitches or an inducible expression system to aptamers, we enabled inducible regulation of protein-specific O-GlcNAcylation. Together, our findings demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of dual-specificity aptamers for regulating O-GlcNAcylation on individual proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Quiescence is a common cellular state, required for stem cell maintenance and microorganismal survival under stress conditions or starvation. However, the mechanisms promoting quiescence maintenance remain poorly known. Plasma membrane components segregate into distinct microdomains, yet the role of this compartmentalization in quiescence remains unexplored. Here, we show that flavodoxin-like proteins (FLPs), ubiquinone reductases of the yeast eisosome membrane compartment, protect quiescent cells from lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Eisosomes and FLPs expand specifically in respiratory-active quiescent cells, and mutants lacking either show accelerated aging and defective quiescence maintenance and accumulate peroxidized phospholipids with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). FLPs are essential for the extramitochondrial regeneration of the lipophilic antioxidant ubiquinol. FLPs, alongside the Gpx1/2/3 glutathione peroxidases, prevent iron-driven, PUFA-dependent ferroptotic cell death. Our work describes ferroptosis-protective mechanisms in yeast and introduces plasma membrane compartmentalization as an important factor in the long-term survival of quiescent cells.

Abstract: Summary
The efficacy and safety of gene-therapy strategies for indications like tissue damage hinge on precision; yet, current methods afford little spatial or temporal control of payload delivery. Here, we find that tissue-regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) isolated from zebrafish can direct targeted, injury-associated gene expression from viral DNA vectors delivered systemically in small and large adult mammalian species. When employed in combination with CRISPR-based epigenome editing tools in mice, zebrafish TREEs stimulated or repressed the expression of endogenous genes after ischemic myocardial infarction. Intravenously delivered recombinant AAV vectors designed with a TREE to direct a constitutively active YAP factor boosted indicators of cardiac regeneration in mice and improved the function of the injured heart. Our findings establish the application of contextual enhancer elements as a potential therapeutic platform for spatiotemporally controlled tissue regeneration in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have a number of unique physiologic adaptations that enable lifelong maintenance of blood cell production, including a highly regulated rate of protein synthesis. Yet, the precise vulnerabilities that arise from such adaptations have not been fully characterized. Here, inspired by a bone marrow failure disorder due to the loss of the histone deubiquitinase MYSM1, characterized by selectively disadvantaged HSCs, we show how reduced protein synthesis in HSCs results in increased ferroptosis. HSC maintenance can be fully rescued by blocking ferroptosis, despite no alteration in protein synthesis rates. Importantly, this selective vulnerability to ferroptosis not only underlies HSC loss in MYSM1 deficiency but also characterizes a broader liability of human HSCs. Increasing protein synthesis rates via MYSM1 overexpression makes HSCs less susceptible to ferroptosis, more broadly illustrating the selective vulnerabilities that arise in somatic stem cell populations as a result of physiologic adaptations.

Abstract: Summary
4.5SH RNA is a highly abundant, small rodent-specific noncoding RNA that localizes to nuclear speckles enriched in pre-mRNA-splicing regulators. To investigate the physiological functions of 4.5SH RNA, we have created mutant mice that lack the expression of 4.5SH RNA. The mutant mice exhibited embryonic lethality, suggesting that 4.5SH RNA is an essential species-specific noncoding RNA in mice. RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that 4.5SH RNA protects the transcriptome from abnormal exonizations of the antisense insertions of the retrotransposon SINE B1 (asB1), which would otherwise introduce deleterious premature stop codons or frameshift mutations. Mechanistically, 4.5SH RNA base pairs with complementary asB1-containing exons via the target recognition region and recruits effector proteins including Hnrnpm via its 5′ stem loop region. The modular organization of 4.5SH RNA allows us to engineer a programmable splicing regulator to induce the skipping of target exons of interest. Our results also suggest the general existence of splicing regulatory noncoding RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common chemical modification for mammalian mRNA and exhibits high dynamics in various biological processes. However, dynamics of m6A RNA methylome during leukemogenesis remains unknown. Here, we delineate a comprehensive m6A landscape during acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development and identify PRMT6 as a key for maintaining AML stem cells. We observe an obvious change in m6A methylome during leukemogenesis and find that protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 and m6A reader IGF2BP2 maintain the function of human and murine leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PRMT6 damages AML development and LSC function. Mechanistically, IGF2BP2 stabilizes PRMT6 mRNA via m6A-mediated manner, which catalyzes H3R2me2a and suppresses lipid transporter MFSD2A expression. PRMT6 loss upregulates MFSD2A expression that increases docosahexaenoic acid levels and impairs LSC maintenance. Collectively, our findings reveal a critical role of PRMT6-MFSD2A signaling axis in AML development and provide a therapeutic strategy for targeting LSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The cortex influences movement by widespread top-down projections to many nervous system regions. Skilled forelimb movements require brainstem circuitry in the medulla; however, the logic of cortical interactions with these neurons remains unexplored. Here, we reveal a fine-grained anatomical and functional map between anterior cortex (AC) and medulla in mice. Distinct cortical regions generate three-dimensional synaptic columns tiling the lateral medulla, topographically matching the dorso-ventral positions of postsynaptic neurons tuned to distinct forelimb action phases. Although medial AC (MAC) terminates ventrally and connects to forelimb-reaching-tuned neurons and its silencing impairs reaching, lateral AC (LAC) influences dorsally positioned neurons tuned to food handling, and its silencing impairs handling. Cortico-medullary neurons also extend collaterals to other subcortical structures through a segregated channel interaction logic. Our findings reveal a precise alignment between cortical location, its function, and specific forelimb-action-tuned medulla neurons, thereby clarifying interaction principles between these two key structures and beyond.

Abstract: Summary
Blood and lymphatic vessels form a versatile transport network and provide inductive signals to regulate tissue-specific functions. Blood vessels in bone regulate osteogenesis and hematopoiesis, but current dogma suggests that bone lacks lymphatic vessels. Here, by combining high-resolution light-sheet imaging and cell-specific mouse genetics, we demonstrate presence of lymphatic vessels in mouse and human bones. We find that lymphatic vessels in bone expand during genotoxic stress. VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling and genotoxic stress-induced IL6 drive lymphangiogenesis in bones. During lymphangiogenesis, secretion of CXCL12 from proliferating lymphatic endothelial cells is critical for hematopoietic and bone regeneration. Moreover, lymphangiocrine CXCL12 triggers expansion of mature Myh11+ CXCR4+ pericytes, which differentiate into bone cells and contribute to bone and hematopoietic regeneration. In aged animals, such expansion of lymphatic vessels and Myh11-positive cells in response to genotoxic stress is impaired. These data suggest lymphangiogenesis as a therapeutic avenue to stimulate hematopoietic and bone regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The composite material-like extracellular matrix (ECM) in the sinoatrial node (SAN) supports the native pacemaking cardiomyocytes (PCMs). To test the roles of SAN ECM in the PCM phenotype and function, we engineered reconstructed-SAN heart tissues (rSANHTs) by recellularizing porcine SAN ECMs with hiPSC-derived PCMs. The hiPSC-PCMs in rSANHTs self-organized into clusters resembling the native SAN and displayed higher expression of pacemaker-specific genes and a faster automaticity compared with PCMs in reconstructed-left ventricular heart tissues (rLVHTs). To test the protective nature of SAN ECMs under strain, rSANHTs and rLVHTs were transplanted onto the murine thoracic diaphragm to undergo constant cyclic strain. All strained-rSANHTs preserved automaticity, whereas 66% of strained-rLVHTs lost their automaticity. In contrast to the strained-rLVHTs, PCMs in strained-rSANHTs maintained high expression of key pacemaker genes (HCN4, TBX3, and TBX18). These findings highlight the promotive and protective roles of the composite SAN ECM and provide valuable insights for pacemaking tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
The choroid plexus (ChP) is the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier and the primary source of CSF. Acquired hydrocephalus, caused by brain infection or hemorrhage, lacks drug treatments due to obscure pathobiology. Our integrated, multi-omic investigation of post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) and post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) models revealed that lipopolysaccharide and blood breakdown products trigger highly similar TLR4-dependent immune responses at the ChP-CSF interface. The resulting CSF “cytokine storm”, elicited from peripherally derived and border-associated ChP macrophages, causes increased CSF production from ChP epithelial cells via phospho-activation of the TNF-receptor-associated kinase SPAK, which serves as a regulatory scaffold of a multi-ion transporter protein complex. Genetic or pharmacological immunomodulation prevents PIH and PHH by antagonizing SPAK-dependent CSF hypersecretion. These results reveal the ChP as a dynamic, cellularly heterogeneous tissue with highly regulated immune-secretory capacity, expand our understanding of ChP immune-epithelial cell cross talk, and reframe PIH and PHH as related neuroimmune disorders vulnerable to small molecule pharmacotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification in mammalian mRNAs, is involved in many pathological processes. METTL16 is a recently identified m6A methyltransferase. However, its role in leukemia has yet to be investigated. Here, we show that METTL16 is a highly essential gene for the survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells via CRISPR-Cas9 screening and experimental validation. METTL16 is aberrantly overexpressed in human AML cells, especially in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). Genetic depletion of METTL16 dramatically suppresses AML initiation/development and maintenance and significantly attenuates LSC/LIC self-renewal, while moderately influencing normal hematopoiesis in mice. Mechanistically, METTL16 exerts its oncogenic role by promoting expression of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) transaminase 1 (BCAT1) and BCAT2 in an m6A-dependent manner and reprogramming BCAA metabolism in AML. Collectively, our results characterize the METTL16/m6A/BCAT1-2/BCAA axis in leukemogenesis and highlight the essential role of METTL16-mediated m6A epitranscriptome and BCAA metabolism reprograming in leukemogenesis and LSC/LIC maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin landscapes are disrupted during DNA replication and must be restored faithfully to maintain genome regulation and cell identity. The histone H3-H4 modification landscape is restored by parental histone recycling and modification of new histones. How DNA replication impacts on histone H2A-H2B is currently unknown. Here, we measure H2A-H2B modifications and H2A.Z during DNA replication and across the cell cycle using quantitative genomics. We show that H2AK119ub1, H2BK120ub1, and H2A.Z are recycled accurately during DNA replication. Modified H2A-H2B are segregated symmetrically to daughter strands via POLA1 on the lagging strand, but independent of H3-H4 recycling. Post-replication, H2A-H2B modification and variant landscapes are quickly restored, and H2AK119ub1 guides accurate restoration of H3K27me3. This work reveals epigenetic transmission of parental H2A-H2B during DNA replication and identifies cross talk between H3-H4 and H2A-H2B modifications in epigenome propagation. We propose that rapid short-term memory of recycled H2A-H2B modifications facilitates restoration of stable H3-H4 chromatin states.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease characterized by myelin loss. While therapies exist to slow MS progression, no treatment currently exists for remyelination. Remyelination, linked to reduced disability in MS, relies on microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). This study aims to understand the role of microglia during remyelination by lineage tracing and depleting them. Microglial lineage tracing reveals that both microglia and MDMs initially accumulate, but microglia later dominate the lesion. Microglia and MDMs engulf equal amounts of inhibitory myelin debris, but after microglial depletion, MDMs compensate by engulfing more myelin debris. Microglial depletion does, however, reduce the recruitment and proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and impairs their subsequent differentiation and remyelination. These findings underscore the essential role of microglia during remyelination and offer insights for enhancing this process by understanding microglial regulation of remyelination.

Abstract: Summary
How SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the airway barrier of mucus and periciliary mucins to infect nasal epithelium remains unclear. Using primary nasal epithelial organoid cultures, we found that the virus attaches to motile cilia via the ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 traverses the mucus layer, using motile cilia as tracks to access the cell body. Depleting cilia blocks infection for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 progeny attach to airway microvilli 24 h post-infection and trigger formation of apically extended and highly branched microvilli that organize viral egress from the microvilli back into the mucus layer, supporting a model of virus dispersion throughout airway tissue via mucociliary transport. Phosphoproteomics and kinase inhibition reveal that microvillar remodeling is regulated by p21-activated kinases (PAK). Importantly, Omicron variants bind with higher affinity to motile cilia and show accelerated viral entry. Our work suggests that motile cilia, microvilli, and mucociliary-dependent mucus flow are critical for efficient virus replication in nasal epithelia.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose is a universal bioenergy source; however, its role in controlling protein interactions is unappreciated, as are its actions during differentiation-associated intracellular glucose elevation. Azido-glucose click chemistry identified glucose binding to a variety of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), including the DDX21 RNA helicase, which was found to be essential for epidermal differentiation. Glucose bound the ATP-binding domain of DDX21, altering protein conformation, inhibiting helicase activity, and dissociating DDX21 dimers. Glucose elevation during differentiation was associated with DDX21 re-localization from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm where DDX21 assembled into larger protein complexes containing RNA splicing factors. DDX21 localized to specific SCUGSDGC motif in mRNA introns in a glucose-dependent manner and promoted the splicing of key pro-differentiation genes, including GRHL3, KLF4, OVOL1, and RBPJ. These findings uncover a biochemical mechanism of action for glucose in modulating the dimerization and function of an RNA helicase essential for tissue differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Axial development of mammals involves coordinated morphogenetic events, including axial elongation, somitogenesis, and neural tube formation. To gain insight into the signals controlling the dynamics of human axial morphogenesis, we generated axially elongating organoids by inducing anteroposterior symmetry breaking of spatially coupled epithelial cysts derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Each organoid was composed of a neural tube flanked by presomitic mesoderm sequentially segmented into somites. Periodic activation of the somite differentiation gene MESP2 coincided in space and time with anteriorly traveling segmentation clock waves in the presomitic mesoderm of the organoids, recapitulating critical aspects of somitogenesis. Timed perturbations demonstrated that FGF and WNT signaling play distinct roles in axial elongation and somitogenesis, and that FGF signaling gradients drive segmentation clock waves. By generating and perturbing organoids that robustly recapitulate the architecture of multiple axial tissues in human embryos, this work offers a means to dissect mechanisms underlying human embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals remains a debated subject. Here, we demonstrate that DNA methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands (CGIs) can be transmitted from parents to their offspring in mice. We generated DNA methylation-edited mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in which CGIs of two metabolism-related genes, the Ankyrin repeat domain 26 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor, were specifically methylated and silenced. DNA methylation-edited mice generated by microinjection of the methylated ESCs exhibited abnormal metabolic phenotypes. Acquired methylation of the targeted CGI and the phenotypic traits were maintained and transmitted across multiple generations. The heritable CGI methylation was subjected to reprogramming in parental PGCs and subsequently reestablished in the next generation at post-implantation stages. These observations provide a concrete step toward demonstrating transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals, which may have implications in our understanding of evolutionary biology as well as the etiology, diagnosis, and prevention of non-genetically inherited human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Opioids are effective analgesics, but their use is beset by serious side effects, including addiction and respiratory depression, which contribute to the ongoing opioid crisis. The human opioid system contains four opioid receptors (μOR, δOR, κOR, and NOPR) and a set of related endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs), which show distinct selectivity toward their respective opioid receptors (ORs). Despite being key to the development of safer analgesics, the mechanisms of molecular recognition and selectivity of EOPs to ORs remain unclear. Here, we systematically characterize the binding of EOPs to ORs and present five structures of EOP-OR-Gi complexes, including β-endorphin- and endomorphin-bound μOR, deltorphin-bound δOR, dynorphin-bound κOR, and nociceptin-bound NOPR. These structures, supported by biochemical results, uncover the specific recognition and selectivity of opioid peptides and the conserved mechanism of opioid receptor activation. These results provide a structural framework to facilitate rational design of safer opioid drugs for pain relief.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-independent reprogramming of differentiated cells has recently been identified as an important paradigm for repairing injured tissues. Following periportal injury, mature hepatocytes re-activate reprogramming/progenitor-related genes (RRGs) and dedifferentiate into liver progenitor-like cells (LPLCs) in both mice and humans, which contribute remarkably to regeneration. However, it remains unknown which and how external factors trigger hepatocyte reprogramming. Here, by employing single-cell transcriptional profiling and lineage-specific deletion tools, we uncovered that periportal-specific LPLC formation was initiated by regionally activated Kupffer cells but not peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages. Unexpectedly, using in vivo screening, the proinflammatory factor IL-6 was identified as the niche signal repurposed for RRG induction via STAT3 activation, which drove RRG expression through binding to their pre-accessible enhancers. Notably, RRGs were activated through injury-specific rather than liver embryogenesis-related enhancers. Collectively, these findings depict an injury-specific niche signal and the inflammation-mediated transcription in driving the conversion of hepatocytes into a progenitor phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of the immune system is a cardinal feature of opioid addiction. Here, we characterize the landscape of peripheral immune cells from patients with opioid use disorder and from healthy controls. Opioid-associated blood exhibited an abnormal distribution of immune cells characterized by a significant expansion of fragile-like regulatory T cells (Tregs), which was positively correlated with the withdrawal score. Analogously, opioid-treated mice also showed enhanced Treg-derived interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression. IFN-γ signaling reshaped synaptic morphology in nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons, modulating subsequent withdrawal symptoms. We demonstrate that opioids increase the expression of neuron-derived C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) and disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity through the downregulation of astrocyte-derived fatty-acid-binding protein 7 (Fabp7), which both triggered peripheral Treg infiltration into NAc. Our study demonstrates that opioids drive the expansion of fragile-like Tregs and favor peripheral Treg diapedesis across the BBB, which leads to IFN-γ-mediated synaptic instability and subsequent withdrawal symptoms.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes, DNA replication initiation requires assembly and activation of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2–7 double hexamer (DH) to melt origin DNA strands. However, the mechanism for this initial melting is unknown. Here, we report a 2.59-Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human MCM-DH (hMCM-DH), also known as the pre-replication complex. In this structure, the hMCM-DH with a constricted central channel untwists and stretches the DNA strands such that almost a half turn of the bound duplex DNA is distorted with 1 base pair completely separated, generating an initial open structure (IOS) at the hexamer junction. Disturbing the IOS inhibits DH formation and replication initiation. Mapping of hMCM-DH footprints indicates that IOSs are distributed across the genome in large clusters aligning well with initiation zones designed for stochastic origin firing. This work unravels an intrinsic mechanism that couples DH formation with initial DNA melting to license replication initiation in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Variation in lung alveolar development is strongly linked to disease susceptibility. However, underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are difficult to study in humans. We have identified an alveolar-fated epithelial progenitor in human fetal lungs, which we grow as self-organizing organoids that model key aspects of cell lineage commitment. Using this system, we have functionally validated cell-cell interactions in the developing human alveolar niche, showing that Wnt signaling from differentiating fibroblasts promotes alveolar-type-2 cell identity, whereas myofibroblasts secrete the Wnt inhibitor, NOTUM, providing spatial patterning. We identify a Wnt-NKX2.1 axis controlling alveolar differentiation. Moreover, we show that differential binding of NKX2.1 coordinates alveolar maturation, allowing us to model the effects of human genetic variation in NKX2.1 on alveolar differentiation. Our organoid system recapitulates key aspects of human fetal lung stem cell biology allowing mechanistic experiments to determine the cellular and molecular regulation of human development and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Although many prokaryotes have glycolysis alternatives, it’s considered as the only energy-generating glucose catabolic pathway in eukaryotes. Here, we managed to create a hybrid-glycolysis yeast. Subsequently, we identified an inositol pyrophosphatase encoded by OCA5 that could regulate glycolysis and respiration by adjusting 5-diphosphoinositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate (5-InsP7) levels. 5-InsP7 levels could regulate the expression of genes involved in glycolysis and respiration, representing a global mechanism that could sense ATP levels and regulate central carbon metabolism. The hybrid-glycolysis yeast did not produce ethanol during growth under excess glucose and could produce 2.68 g/L free fatty acids, which is the highest reported production in shake flask of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study demonstrated the significance of hybrid-glycolysis yeast and determined Oca5 as an inositol pyrophosphatase controlling the balance between glycolysis and respiration, which may shed light on the role of inositol pyrophosphates in regulating eukaryotic metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Atg15 (autophagy-related 15) is a vacuolar phospholipase essential for the degradation of cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) bodies and autophagic bodies, hereinafter referred to as intravacuolar/intralysosomal autophagic compartments (IACs), but it remains unknown if Atg15 directly disrupts IAC membranes. Here, we show that the recombinant Chaetomium thermophilum Atg15 lipase domain (CtAtg15(73–475)) possesses phospholipase activity. The activity of CtAtg15(73–475) was markedly elevated by limited digestion. We inserted the human rhinovirus 3C protease recognition sequence and found that cleavage between S159 and V160 was important to activate CtAtg15(73–475). Our molecular dynamics simulation suggested that the cleavage facilitated conformational change around the active center of CtAtg15, resulting in an exposed state. We confirmed that CtAtg15 could disintegrate S. cerevisiae IAC in vivo. Further, both mitochondria and IAC of S. cerevisiae were disintegrated by CtAtg15. This study suggests Atg15 plays a role in disrupting any organelle membranes delivered to vacuoles by autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute (AGO) proteins execute microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing. However, it is unclear whether all 4 mammalian AGO proteins (AGO1, AGO2, AGO3, and AGO4) are required for miRNA activity. We generate Ago1, Ago3, and Ago4-deficient mice (Ago134Δ) and find AGO1/3/4 to be redundant for miRNA biogenesis, homeostasis, or function, a role that is carried out by AGO2. Instead, AGO1/3/4 regulate the expansion of type 2 immunity via precursor mRNA splicing in CD4+ T helper (Th) lymphocytes. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that nuclear AGO3 interacts directly with SF3B3, a component of the U2 spliceosome complex, to aid global mRNA splicing, and in particular the isoforms of the gene Nisch, resulting in a dysregulated Nisch isoform ratio. This work uncouples AGO1, AGO3, and AGO4 from miRNA-mediated RNA interference, identifies an AGO3:SF3B3 complex in the nucleus, and reveals a mechanism by which AGO proteins regulate inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
CD133 is widely used as a marker to isolate tumor-initiating cells in many types of cancers. The structure of N-glycan on CD133 is altered during the differentiation of tumor-initiating cells. However, the relationship between CD133 N-glycosylation and stem cell characteristics remains elusive. Here, we found that the level of α-1,2-mannosylated CD133 was associated with the level of stemness genes in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) tissues. α-1,2-mannosylated CD133+ cells possessed the characteristics of tumor-initiating cells. The loss of the Golgi α-mannosidase I coding gene MAN1C1 resulted in the formation of α-1,2-mannosylated CD133 in iCCA-initiating cells. Mechanistically, α-1,2-mannosylation promoted the cytoplasmic distribution of CD133 and enhanced the interaction between CD133 and the autophagy gene FIP200, subsequently promoting the tumorigenesis of α-1,2-mannosylated CD133+ cells. Analysis of iCCA samples showed that the level of cytoplasmic CD133 was associated with poor iCCA prognosis. Collectively, α-1,2-mannosylated CD133 is a functional marker of iCCA-initiating cells.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with Rett syndrome suffer from a loss-of-function mutation of the Mecp2 gene, which results in various symptoms including autistic traits and motor deficits. Deletion of Mecp2 in the brain mimics part of these symptoms, but the specific function of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in the cerebellum remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Mecp2 deletion in Purkinje cells (PCs) reduces their intrinsic excitability through a signaling pathway comprising the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel PTP1B and TrkB, the receptor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Aberration of this cascade, in turn, leads to autistic-like behaviors as well as reduced vestibulocerebellar motor learning. Interestingly, increasing activity of TrkB in PCs is sufficient to rescue PC dysfunction and abnormal motor and non-motor behaviors caused by Mecp2 deficiency. Our findings highlight how PC dysfunction may contribute to Rett syndrome, providing insight into the underlying mechanism and paving the way for rational therapeutic designs.

Abstract: Summary
Fanconi anemia (FA) patients experience chromosome instability, yielding hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) exhaustion and predisposition to poor-prognosis myeloid leukemia. Based on a longitudinal cohort of 335 patients, we performed clinical, genomic, and functional studies in 62 patients with clonal evolution. We found a unique pattern of somatic structural variants and mutations that shares features of BRCA-related cancers, the FA-hallmark being unbalanced, microhomology-mediated translocations driving copy-number alterations. Half the patients developed chromosome 1q gain, driving clonal hematopoiesis through MDM4 trisomy downmodulating p53 signaling later followed by secondary acute myeloid lukemia genomic alterations. Functionally, MDM4 triplication conferred greater fitness to murine and human primary FA HSPCs, rescued inflammation-mediated bone marrow failure, and drove clonal dominance in FA mouse models, while targeting MDM4 impaired leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results identify a linear route toward secondary leukemogenesis whereby early MDM4-driven downregulation of basal p53 activation plays a pivotal role, opening monitoring and therapeutic prospects.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by many diverse genetic etiologies. Although therapeutics that specifically target causal mutations may rescue individual types of ALS, such approaches cannot treat most patients since they have unknown genetic etiology. Thus, there is a critical need for therapeutic strategies that rescue multiple forms of ALS. Here, we combine phenotypic chemical screening on a diverse cohort of ALS patient-derived neurons with bioinformatic analysis of large chemical and genetic perturbational datasets to identify broadly effective genetic targets for ALS. We show that suppressing the gene-encoding, spliceosome-associated factor SYF2 alleviates TDP-43 aggregation and mislocalization, improves TDP-43 activity, and rescues C9ORF72 and causes sporadic ALS neuron survival. Moreover, Syf2 suppression ameliorates neurodegeneration, neuromuscular junction loss, and motor dysfunction in TDP-43 mice. Thus, suppression of spliceosome-associated factors such as SYF2 may be a broadly effective therapeutic approach for ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Despite tremendous progress in detecting DNA variants associated with human disease, interpreting their functional impact in a high-throughput and single-base resolution manner remains challenging. Here, we develop a pooled prime-editing screen method, PRIME, that can be applied to characterize thousands of coding and non-coding variants in a single experiment with high reproducibility. To showcase its applications, we first identified essential nucleotides for a 716 bp MYC enhancer via PRIME-mediated single-base resolution analysis. Next, we applied PRIME to functionally characterize 1,304 genome-wide association study (GWAS)-identified non-coding variants associated with breast cancer and 3,699 variants from ClinVar. We discovered that 103 non-coding variants and 156 variants of uncertain significance are functional via affecting cell fitness. Collectively, we demonstrate that PRIME is capable of characterizing genetic variants at single-base resolution and scale, advancing accurate genome annotation for disease risk prediction, diagnosis, and therapeutic target identification.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing has been proposed to be involved in a bacterial anti-phage defense system called RADAR. RADAR contains an adenosine triphosphatase (RdrA) and an adenosine deaminase (RdrB). Here, we report cryo-EM structures of RdrA, RdrB, and currently identified RdrA-RdrB complexes in the presence or absence of RNA and ATP. RdrB assembles into a dodecameric cage with catalytic pockets facing outward, while RdrA adopts both autoinhibited tetradecameric and activation-competent heptameric rings. Structural and functional data suggest a model in which RNA is loaded through the bottom section of the RdrA ring and translocated along its inner channel, a process likely coupled with ATP-binding status. Intriguingly, up to twelve RdrA rings can dock one RdrB cage with precise alignments between deaminase catalytic pockets and RNA-translocation channels, indicative of enzymatic coupling of RNA translocation and deamination. Our data uncover an interesting mechanism of enzymatic coupling and anti-phage defense through supramolecular assemblies.

Abstract: Summary
MODY3 is a monogenic hereditary form of diabetes caused by mutations in the transcription factor HNF1A. The patients progressively develop hyperglycemia due to perturbed insulin secretion, but the pathogenesis is unknown. Using patient-specific hiPSCs, we recapitulate the insulin secretion sensitivity to the membrane depolarizing agent sulfonylurea commonly observed in MODY3 patients. Unexpectedly, MODY3 patient-specific HNF1A+/R272C β cells hypersecrete insulin both in vitro and in vivo after transplantation into mice. Consistently, we identified a trend of increased birth weight in human HNF1A mutation carriers compared with healthy siblings. Reduced expression of potassium channels, specifically the KATP channel, in MODY3 β cells, increased calcium signaling, and rescue of the insulin hypersecretion phenotype by pharmacological targeting ATP-sensitive potassium channels or low-voltage-activated calcium channels suggest that more efficient membrane depolarization underlies the hypersecretion of insulin in MODY3 β cells. Our findings identify a pathogenic mechanism leading to β cell failure in MODY3.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolism is deeply intertwined with aging. Effects of metabolic interventions on aging have been explained with intracellular metabolism, growth control, and signaling. Studying chronological aging in yeast, we reveal a so far overlooked metabolic property that influences aging via the exchange of metabolites. We observed that metabolites exported by young cells are re-imported by chronologically aging cells, resulting in cross-generational metabolic interactions. Then, we used self-establishing metabolically cooperating communities (SeMeCo) as a tool to increase metabolite exchange and observed significant lifespan extensions. The longevity of the SeMeCo was attributable to metabolic reconfigurations in methionine consumer cells. These obtained a more glycolytic metabolism and increased the export of protective metabolites that in turn extended the lifespan of cells that supplied them with methionine. Our results establish metabolite exchange interactions as a determinant of cellular aging and show that metabolically cooperating cells can shape the metabolic environment to extend their lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial communities offer vast potential across numerous sectors but remain challenging to systematically control. We develop a two-stage approach to guide the taxonomic composition of synthetic microbiomes by precisely manipulating media components and initial species abundances. By combining high-throughput experiments and computational modeling, we demonstrate the ability to predict and design the diversity of a 10-member synthetic human gut community. We reveal that critical environmental factors governing monoculture growth can be leveraged to steer microbial communities to desired states. Furthermore, systematically varied initial abundances drive variation in community assembly and enable inference of pairwise inter-species interactions via a dynamic ecological model. These interactions are overall consistent with conditioned media experiments, demonstrating that specific perturbations to a high-richness community can provide rich information for building dynamic ecological models. This model is subsequently used to design low-richness communities that display low or high temporal taxonomic variability over an extended period. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Advanced solid cancers are complex assemblies of tumor, immune, and stromal cells characterized by high intratumoral variation. We use highly multiplexed tissue imaging, 3D reconstruction, spatial statistics, and machine learning to identify cell types and states underlying morphological features of known diagnostic and prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. Quantitation of these features in high-plex marker space reveals recurrent transitions from one tumor morphology to the next, some of which are coincident with long-range gradients in the expression of oncogenes and epigenetic regulators. At the tumor invasive margin, where tumor, normal, and immune cells compete, T cell suppression involves multiple cell types and 3D imaging shows that seemingly localized 2D features such as tertiary lymphoid structures are commonly interconnected and have graded molecular properties. Thus, while cancer genetics emphasizes the importance of discrete changes in tumor state, whole-specimen imaging reveals large-scale morphological and molecular gradients analogous to those in developing tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Complement components have been linked to schizophrenia and autoimmune disorders. We examined the association between neonatal circulating C3 and C4 protein concentrations in 68,768 neonates and the risk of six mental disorders. We completed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for C3 and C4 and applied the summary statistics in Mendelian randomization and phenome-wide association studies related to mental and autoimmune disorders. The GWASs for C3 and C4 protein concentrations identified 15 and 36 independent loci, respectively. We found no associations between neonatal C3 and C4 concentrations and mental disorders in the total sample (both sexes combined); however, post-hoc analyses found that a higher C3 concentration was associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia in females. Mendelian randomization based on C4 summary statistics found an altered risk of five types of autoimmune disorders. Our study adds to our understanding of the associations between C3 and C4 concentrations and subsequent mental and autoimmune disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Natural polyamines such as spermidine and spermine cations have characteristics that make them highly likely to be sensed by riboswitches, such as their general affinity to polyanionic RNA and their broad contributions to cell physiology. Despite previous claims that polyamine riboswitches exist, evidence of their biological functions has remained unconvincing. Here, we report that rare variants of bacterial S-adenosylmethionine-I (SAM-I) riboswitches reject SAM and have adapted to selectively sense spermidine. These spermidine-sensing riboswitch variants are associated with genes whose protein products are directly involved in the production of spermidine and other polyamines. Biochemical and genetic assays demonstrate that representatives of this riboswitch class robustly function as genetic “off” switches, wherein spermidine binding causes premature transcription termination to suppress the expression of polyamine biosynthetic genes. These findings confirm the existence of natural spermidine-sensing riboswitches in bacteria and expand the list of variant riboswitch classes that have adapted to bind different ligands.

Abstract: Summary
For virus infection of new host cells, the disassembly of the protective outer protein shell (capsid) is a critical step, but the mechanisms and host-virus interactions underlying the dynamic, active, and regulated uncoating process are largely unknown. Here, we develop an experimentally supported, multiscale kinetics model that elucidates mechanisms of influenza A virus (IAV) uncoating in cells. Biophysical modeling demonstrates that interactions between capsid M1 proteins, host histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), and molecular motors can physically break the capsid in a tug-of-war mechanism. Biochemical analysis and biochemical-biophysical modeling identify unanchored ubiquitin chains as essential and allow robust prediction of uncoating efficiency in cells. Remarkably, the different infectivity of two clinical strains can be ascribed to a single amino acid variation in M1 that affects binding to HDAC6. By identifying crucial modules of viral infection kinetics, the mechanisms and models presented here could help formulate novel strategies for broad-range antiviral treatment.

Abstract: The history of developmental biology starts from the almost simultaneous discoveries of the Organizer of axial structures in amphibians by Spemann and Mangold in Freiburg and of the Brachyury mutant in mammals by the Dobrovolskaya-Zavadskaya laboratory at the Curie Institute and its follow-up studies in the Leslie Dunn laboratory at Columbia University. Following the Organizer's discovery, the inductive activity of several other embryonic tissues was found, including that of the ear primordium by Boris Balinsky in Kiev. Initially, the experimental embryological and genetic lines of research existed independently of each other, but after they met at the bench of Salome Gluecksohn, they strengthened and cross-fertilized each other, eventually leading to developmental genetics, which later became known as developmental biology. It appears that the regulatory activities of Brachyury and related T-box proteins in general are at the heart of the development of all vertebrates. These activities are fundamental and have been discovered in several model organisms subjected to mutagenesis, exemplified by the story of George Streisinger's discovery of the no tail mutant in zebrafish. This essay describes the history of Brachyury studies, their connection to an idea of embryonic induction by Organizer, and an impact of Brachyury and related genes on various fields of research from embryology and cell biology to medical genetics and evolutionary theory.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that results from many diverse genetic causes. Although therapeutics specifically targeting known causal mutations may rescue individual types of ALS, these approaches cannot treat most cases since they have unknown genetic etiology. Thus, there is a pressing need for therapeutic strategies that rescue multiple forms of ALS. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PIKFYVE kinase activates an unconventional protein clearance mechanism involving exocytosis of aggregation-prone proteins. Reducing PIKFYVE activity ameliorates ALS pathology and extends survival of animal models and patient-derived motor neurons representing diverse forms of ALS including C9ORF72, TARDBP, FUS, and sporadic. These findings highlight a potential approach for mitigating ALS pathogenesis that does not require stimulating macroautophagy or the ubiquitin-proteosome system.

Abstract: Summary
Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) DNA damage response (DDR) kinases contain elastic domains. ATM also responds to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATR to nuclear mechanical stress. Mre11 mediates ATM activation following DNA damage; ATM mutations cause ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). Here, using in vivo imaging, electron microscopy, proteomic, and mechano-biology approaches, we study how ATM responds to mechanical stress. We report that cytoskeleton and ROS, but not Mre11, mediate ATM activation following cell deformation. ATM deficiency causes hyper-stiffness, stress fiber accumulation, Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear enrichment, plasma and nuclear membrane alterations during interstitial migration, and H3 hyper-methylation. ATM locates to the actin cytoskeleton and, following cytoskeleton stress, promotes phosphorylation of key cytoskeleton and chromatin regulators. Our data contribute to explain some clinical features of patients with A-T and pinpoint the existence of an integrated mechano-response in which ATM and ATR have distinct roles unrelated to their canonical DDR functions.

Abstract: Summary
Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is a frequent event in cancer evolution and an important driver of aneuploidy. The role of the p53 tumor suppressor in WGD has been enigmatic: p53 can block the proliferation of tetraploid cells, acting as a barrier to WGD, but can also promote mitotic bypass, a key step in WGD via endoreduplication. In wild-type (WT) p53 tumors, WGD is frequently associated with activation of the E2F pathway, especially amplification of CCNE1, encoding cyclin E1. Here, we show that elevated cyclin E1 expression causes replicative stress, which activates ATR- and Chk1-dependent G2 phase arrest. p53, via its downstream target p21, together with Wee1, then inhibits mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activity sufficiently to activate APC/CCdh1 and promote mitotic bypass. Cyclin E expression suppresses p53-dependent senescence after mitotic bypass, allowing cells to complete endoreduplication. Our results indicate that p53 can contribute to cancer evolution through the promotion of WGD.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated myeloid cells modulate the tumor microenvironment and affect tumor progression. Type I interferon (IFN-I) has multiple effects on tumors and immune response, and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18) functions as a negative regulator of IFN-I signal transduction. This study aims to examine the function of IFN-I in myeloid cells during tumor progression. Here, we show that deletion of USP18 in myeloid cells suppresses tumor progression. Enhanced IFN-I signaling and blocked USP18 expression prompt downregulation of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages toward pro-inflammatory phenotypes. Further in vitro experiments reveal that downregulation of CSF1R is mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome degradation via E3 ligase neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentaly downregulated 4 (NEDD4) and the IFN-induced increase in ubiquitin E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme H5. USP18 impairs ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CSF1R by interrupting NEDD4 binding to CSF1R. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role of IFN-I in macrophage polarization by regulating CSF1R via USP18 and suggest targeting USP18 in myeloid-lineage cells as an effective strategy for IFN-based therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The BQ and XBB subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron are now rapidly expanding, possibly due to altered antibody evasion properties deriving from their additional spike mutations. Here, we report that neutralization of BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1 by sera from vaccinees and infected persons was markedly impaired, including sera from individuals boosted with a WA1/BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccine. Titers against BQ and XBB subvariants were lower by 13- to 81-fold and 66- to 155-fold, respectively, far beyond what had been observed to date. Monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing the original Omicron variant were largely inactive against these new subvariants, and the responsible individual spike mutations were identified. These subvariants were found to have similar ACE2-binding affinities as their predecessors. Together, our findings indicate that BQ and XBB subvariants present serious threats to current COVID-19 vaccines, render inactive all authorized antibodies, and may have gained dominance in the population because of their advantage in evading antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
We report an in situ vaccination, adaptable to nearly any type of cancer, that combines radiotherapy targeting one tumor and intratumoral injection of this site with tumor-specific antibody and interleukin-2 (IL-2; 3xTx). In a phase I clinical trial, administration of 3xTx (with an immunocytokine fusion of tumor-specific antibody and IL-2, hu14.18-IL2) to subjects with metastatic melanoma increases peripheral CD8+ T cell effector polyfunctionality. This suggests the potential for 3xTx to promote antitumor immunity against metastatic tumors. In poorly immunogenic syngeneic murine melanoma or head and neck carcinoma models, 3xTx stimulates CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor responses at targeted and non-targeted tumors. During 3xTx treatment, natural killer (NK) cells promote CTLA4+ regulatory T cell (Treg) apoptosis in non-targeted tumors. This is dependent on NK cell expression of CD86, which is upregulated downstream of KLRK1. NK cell depletion increases Treg infiltration, diminishing CD8+ T cell-dependent antitumor response. These findings demonstrate that NK cells sustain and propagate CD8+ T cell immunity following 3xTx.

Abstract: Summary
We introduce BacDrop, a highly scalable technology for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing that has overcome many challenges hindering the development of scRNA-seq in bacteria. BacDrop can be applied to thousands to millions of cells from both gram-negative and gram-positive species. It features universal ribosomal RNA depletion and combinatorial barcodes that enable multiplexing and massively parallel sequencing. We applied BacDrop to study Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates and to elucidate their heterogeneous responses to antibiotic stress. In an unperturbed population presumed to be homogeneous, we found within-population heterogeneity largely driven by the expression of mobile genetic elements that promote the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Under antibiotic perturbation, BacDrop revealed transcriptionally distinct subpopulations associated with different phenotypic outcomes including antibiotic persistence. BacDrop thus can capture cellular states that cannot be detected by bulk RNA-seq, which will unlock new microbiological insights into bacterial responses to perturbations and larger bacterial communities such as the microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
All living things experience an increase in entropy, manifested as a loss of genetic and epigenetic information. In yeast, epigenetic information is lost over time due to the relocalization of chromatin-modifying proteins to DNA breaks, causing cells to lose their identity, a hallmark of yeast aging. Using a system called “ICE” (inducible changes to the epigenome), we find that the act of faithful DNA repair advances aging at physiological, cognitive, and molecular levels, including erosion of the epigenetic landscape, cellular exdifferentiation, senescence, and advancement of the DNA methylation clock, which can be reversed by OSK-mediated rejuvenation. These data are consistent with the information theory of aging, which states that a loss of epigenetic information is a reversible cause of aging.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and pyrin domain (PYD)-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a critical mediator of the innate immune response. How NLRP3 responds to stimuli and initiates the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome is not fully understood. Here, we found that a cellular metabolite, palmitate, facilitates NLRP3 activation by enhancing its S-palmitoylation, in synergy with lipopolysaccharide stimulation. NLRP3 is post-translationally palmitoylated by zinc-finger and aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine 5 (ZDHHC5) at the LRR domain, which promotes NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Silencing ZDHHC5 blocks NLRP3 oligomerization, NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, and formation of large intracellular ASC aggregates, leading to abrogation of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/18 release, and GSDMD cleavage, both in human cells and in mice. ABHD17A depalmitoylates NLRP3, and one human-heritable disease-associated mutation in NLRP3 was found to be associated with defective ABHD17A binding and hyper-palmitoylation. Furthermore, Zdhhc5−/− mice showed defective NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo. Taken together, our data reveal an endogenous mechanism of inflammasome assembly and activation and suggest NLRP3 palmitoylation as a potential target for the treatment of NLRP3 inflammasome-driven diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) elicits potently neutralizing yet mostly strain-specific antibodies. Here, we evaluate the ability of several immunofocusing techniques to enhance the functional breadth of vaccine-elicited immune responses against the HA RBD. We present a series of “trihead” nanoparticle immunogens that display native-like closed trimeric RBDs from the HAs of several H1N1 influenza viruses. The series includes hyperglycosylated and hypervariable variants that incorporate natural and designed sequence diversity at key positions in the receptor-binding site periphery. Nanoparticle immunogens displaying triheads or hyperglycosylated triheads elicit higher hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing activity than the corresponding immunogens lacking either trimer-stabilizing mutations or hyperglycosylation. By contrast, mosaic nanoparticle display and antigen hypervariation do not significantly alter the magnitude or breadth of vaccine-elicited antibodies. Our results yield important insights into antibody responses against the RBD and the ability of several structure-based immunofocusing techniques to influence vaccine-elicited antibody responses.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammasomes are multiprotein signaling complexes that activate the innate immune system. Canonical inflammasomes recruit and activate caspase-1, which then cleaves and activates IL-1β and IL-18, as well as gasdermin D (GSDMD) to induce pyroptosis. In contrast, non-canonical inflammasomes, caspases-4/-5 (CASP4/5) in humans and caspase-11 (CASP11) in mice, are known to cleave GSDMD, but their role in direct processing of other substrates besides GSDMD has remained unknown. Here, we show that CASP4/5 but not CASP11 can directly cleave and activate IL-18. However, CASP4/5/11 can all cleave IL-1β to generate a 27-kDa fragment that deactivates IL-1β signaling. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the sequence identity of the tetrapeptide sequence adjacent to the caspase cleavage site regulates IL-18 and IL-1β recruitment and activation. Altogether, we have identified new substrates of the non-canonical inflammasomes and reveal key mechanistic details regulating inflammation that may aid in developing new therapeutics for immune-related disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Components of transcriptional machinery are selectively partitioned into specific condensates, often mediated by protein disorder, yet we know little about how this specificity is achieved. Here, we show that condensates composed of the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of MED1 selectively partition RNA polymerase II together with its positive allosteric regulators while excluding negative regulators. This selective compartmentalization is sufficient to activate transcription and is required for gene activation during a cell-state transition. The IDRs of partitioned proteins are necessary and sufficient for selective compartmentalization and require alternating blocks of charged amino acids. Disrupting this charge pattern prevents partitioning, whereas adding the pattern to proteins promotes partitioning with functional consequences for gene activation. IDRs with similar patterned charge blocks show similar partitioning and function. These findings demonstrate that disorder-mediated interactions can selectively compartmentalize specific functionally related proteins from a complex mixture of biomolecules, leading to regulation of a biochemical pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Learning has been associated with modifications of synaptic and circuit properties, but the precise changes storing information in mammals have remained largely unclear. We combined genetically targeted voltage imaging with targeted optogenetic activation and silencing of pre- and post-synaptic neurons to study the mechanisms underlying hippocampal behavioral timescale plasticity. In mice navigating a virtual-reality environment, targeted optogenetic activation of individual CA1 cells at specific places induced stable representations of these places in the targeted cells. Optical elicitation, recording, and modulation of synaptic transmission in behaving mice revealed that activity in presynaptic CA2/3 cells was required for the induction of plasticity in CA1 and, furthermore, that during induction of these place fields in single CA1 cells, synaptic input from CA2/3 onto these same cells was potentiated. These results reveal synaptic implementation of hippocampal behavioral timescale plasticity and define a methodology to resolve synaptic plasticity during learning and memory in behaving mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a leading risk factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we report that CHRNA4, a subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), is an accelerator of MASH progression. CHRNA4 also mediates the MASH-promotive effects induced by smoking. Chrna4 was expressed specifically in hepatocytes and exhibited increased levels in mice and patients with MASH. Elevated CHRNA4 levels were positively correlated with MASH severity. We further revealed that during MASH development, acetylcholine released from immune cells or nicotine derived from smoking functioned as an agonist to activate hepatocyte-intrinsic CHRNA4, inducing calcium influx and activation of inflammatory signaling. The communication between immune cells and hepatocytes via the acetylcholine-CHRNA4 axis led to the production of a variety of cytokines, eliciting inflammation in liver and promoting the pathogenesis of MASH. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CHRNA4 protected mice from diet-induced MASH. Targeting CHRNA4 might be a promising strategy for MASH therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Brain organoids created from human pluripotent stem cells represent a promising approach for brain repair. They acquire many structural features of the brain and raise the possibility of patient-matched repair. Whether these entities can integrate with host brain networks in the context of the injured adult mammalian brain is not well established. Here, we provide structural and functional evidence that human brain organoids successfully integrate with the adult rat visual system after transplantation into large injury cavities in the visual cortex. Virus-based trans-synaptic tracing reveals a polysynaptic pathway between organoid neurons and the host retina and reciprocal connectivity between the graft and other regions of the visual system. Visual stimulation of host animals elicits responses in organoid neurons, including orientation selectivity. These results demonstrate the ability of human brain organoids to adopt sophisticated function after insertion into large injury cavities, suggesting a translational strategy to restore function after cortical damage.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen-dependent proliferation followed by progesterone-dependent differentiation of the endometrium culminates in a short implantation window. We performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing on endometrial samples obtained across the menstrual cycle to investigate the regulation of temporal gene networks that control embryo implantation. We identify uniquely accessible chromatin regions in all major cellular constituents of the endometrium, delineate temporal patterns of coordinated chromatin remodeling in epithelial and stromal cells, and gain mechanistic insights into the emergence of a receptive state through integrated analysis of enriched transcription factor (TF) binding sites in dynamic chromatin regions, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the implantation window coincides with pervasive cooption of transposable elements (TEs) into the regulatory chromatin landscape of decidualizing cells and expression of TE-derived transcripts in a spatially defined manner. Our data constitute a comprehensive map of the chromatin changes that control TF activities in a cycling endometrium at cellular resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Viroids and viroid-like covalently closed circular (ccc) RNAs are minimal replicators that typically encode no proteins and hijack cellular enzymes for replication. The extent and diversity of viroid-like agents are poorly understood. We developed a computational pipeline to identify viroid-like cccRNAs and applied it to 5,131 metatranscriptomes and 1,344 plant transcriptomes. The search yielded 11,378 viroid-like cccRNAs spanning 4,409 species-level clusters, a 5-fold increase compared to the previously identified viroid-like elements. Within this diverse collection, we discovered numerous putative viroids, satellite RNAs, retrozymes, and ribozy-like viruses. Diverse ribozyme combinations and unusual ribozymes within the cccRNAs were identified. Self-cleaving ribozymes were identified in ambiviruses, some mito-like viruses and capsid-encoding satellite virus-like cccRNAs. The broad presence of viroid-like cccRNAs in diverse transcriptomes and ecosystems implies that their host range is far broader than currently known, and matches to CRISPR spacers suggest that some cccRNAs replicate in prokaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Whether and how certain transposable elements with viral origins, such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) dormant in our genomes, can become awakened and contribute to the aging process is largely unknown. In human senescent cells, we found that HERVK (HML-2), the most recently integrated human ERVs, are unlocked to transcribe viral genes and produce retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs). These HERVK RVLPs constitute a transmissible message to elicit senescence phenotypes in young cells, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies. The activation of ERVs was also observed in organs of aged primates and mice as well as in human tissues and serum from the elderly. Their repression alleviates cellular senescence and tissue degeneration and, to some extent, organismal aging. These findings indicate that the resurrection of ERVs is a hallmark and driving force of cellular senescence and tissue aging.

Abstract: Summary
Pleasurable touch is paramount during social behavior, including sexual encounters. However, the identity and precise role of sensory neurons that transduce sexual touch remain unknown. A population of sensory neurons labeled by developmental expression of the G protein-coupled receptor Mrgprb4 detects mechanical stimulation in mice. Here, we study the social relevance of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons and reveal that these neurons are required for sexual receptivity and sufficient to induce dopamine release in the brain. Even in social isolation, optogenetic stimulation of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons through the back skin is sufficient to induce a conditioned place preference and a striking dorsiflexion resembling the lordotic copulatory posture. In the absence of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons, female mice no longer find male mounts rewarding: sexual receptivity is supplanted by aggression and a coincident decline in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Together, these findings establish that Mrgprb4-lineage neurons initiate a skin-to-brain circuit encoding the rewarding quality of social touch.

Abstract: Summary
RADAR is a two-protein bacterial defense system that was reported to defend against phage by “editing” messenger RNA. Here, we determine cryo-EM structures of the RADAR defense complex, revealing RdrA as a heptameric, two-layered AAA+ ATPase and RdrB as a dodecameric, hollow complex with twelve surface-exposed deaminase active sites. RdrA and RdrB join to form a giant assembly up to 10 MDa, with RdrA docked as a funnel over the RdrB active site. Surprisingly, our structures reveal an RdrB active site that targets mononucleotides. We show that RdrB catalyzes ATP-to-ITP conversion in vitro and induces the massive accumulation of inosine mononucleotides during phage infection in vivo, limiting phage replication. Our results define ATP mononucleotide deamination as a determinant of RADAR immunity and reveal supramolecular assembly of a nucleotide-modifying machine as a mechanism of anti-phage defense.

Abstract: Summary
The telomerase ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) replenishes telomeric DNA and minimally requires an RNA component and a catalytic protein subunit. However, telomerase RNP maturation is an intricate process occurring in several subcellular compartments and is incompletely understood. Here, we report how the co-transcriptional association of key telomerase components and nuclear export factors leads to an export-competent, but inactive, RNP. Export is dependent on the 5′ cap, the 3′ extension of unprocessed telomerase RNA, and protein associations. When the RNP reaches the cytoplasm, an extensive protein swap occurs, the RNA is trimmed to its mature length, and the essential catalytic Est2 protein joins the RNP. This mature and active complex is then reimported into the nucleus as its final destination and last processing steps. The irreversible processing events on the RNA thus support a ratchet-type model of telomerase maturation, with only a single nucleo-cytoplasmic cycle that is essential for the assembly of mature telomerase.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp60 chaperonins and their Hsp10 cofactors assist protein folding in all living cells, constituting the paradigmatic example of molecular chaperones. Despite extensive investigations of their structure and mechanism, crucial questions regarding how these chaperonins promote folding remain unsolved. Here, we report that the bacterial Hsp60 chaperonin GroEL forms a stable, functionally relevant complex with the chaperedoxin CnoX, a protein combining a chaperone and a redox function. Binding of GroES (Hsp10 cofactor) to GroEL induces CnoX release. Cryoelectron microscopy provided crucial structural information on the GroEL-CnoX complex, showing that CnoX binds GroEL outside the substrate-binding site via a highly conserved C-terminal α-helix. Furthermore, we identified complexes in which CnoX, bound to GroEL, forms mixed disulfides with GroEL substrates, indicating that CnoX likely functions as a redox quality-control plugin for GroEL. Proteins sharing structural features with CnoX exist in eukaryotes, suggesting that Hsp60 molecular plugins have been conserved through evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue immunity and responses to injury depend on the coordinated action and communication among physiological systems. Here, we show that, upon injury, adaptive responses to the microbiota directly promote sensory neuron regeneration. At homeostasis, tissue-resident commensal-specific T cells colocalize with sensory nerve fibers within the dermis, express a transcriptional program associated with neuronal interaction and repair, and promote axon growth and local nerve regeneration following injury. Mechanistically, our data reveal that the cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) released by commensal-specific Th17 cells upon injury directly signals to sensory neurons via IL-17 receptor A, the transcription of which is specifically upregulated in injured neurons. Collectively, our work reveals that in the context of tissue damage, preemptive immunity to the microbiota can rapidly bridge biological systems by directly promoting neuronal repair, while also identifying IL-17A as a major determinant of this fundamental process.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomes frequently stall during mRNA translation, resulting in the context-dependent activation of quality control pathways to maintain proteostasis. However, surveillance mechanisms that specifically respond to stalled ribosomes with an occluded A site have not been identified. We discovered that the elongation factor-1α (eEF1A) inhibitor, ternatin-4, triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of eEF1A on stalled ribosomes. Using a chemical genetic approach, we unveiled a signaling network comprising two E3 ligases, RNF14 and RNF25, which are required for eEF1A degradation. Quantitative proteomics revealed the RNF14 and RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of eEF1A and a discrete set of ribosomal proteins. The ribosome collision sensor GCN1 plays an essential role by engaging RNF14, which directly ubiquitinates eEF1A. The site-specific, RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of the ribosomal protein RPS27A/eS31 provides a second essential signaling input. Our findings illuminate a ubiquitin signaling network that monitors the ribosomal A site and promotes the degradation of stalled translation factors, including eEF1A and the termination factor eRF1.

Abstract: Summary
We investigate a 2,000-year genetic transect through Scandinavia spanning the Iron Age to the present, based on 48 new and 249 published ancient genomes and genotypes from 16,638 modern individuals. We find regional variation in the timing and magnitude of gene flow from three sources: the eastern Baltic, the British-Irish Isles, and southern Europe. British-Irish ancestry was widespread in Scandinavia from the Viking period, whereas eastern Baltic ancestry is more localized to Gotland and central Sweden. In some regions, a drop in current levels of external ancestry suggests that ancient immigrants contributed proportionately less to the modern Scandinavian gene pool than indicated by the ancestry of genomes from the Viking and Medieval periods. Finally, we show that a north-south genetic cline that characterizes modern Scandinavians is mainly due to the differential levels of Uralic ancestry and that this cline existed in the Viking Age and possibly earlier.

Abstract: Summary
Nervous system function relies on the establishment of complex gene expression programs that provide neuron-type-specific and core pan-neuronal features. These complementary regulatory paradigms are controlled by terminal selector and parallel-acting transcription factors (TFs), respectively. Here, we identify the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) TF as a pervasive direct and indirect regulator of both neuron-type-specific and pan-neuronal gene expression. Mapping global NF-Y targets reveals direct binding to the cis-regulatory regions of pan-neuronal genes and terminal selector TFs. We show that NFYA-1 controls pan-neuronal gene expression directly through binding to CCAAT boxes in target gene promoters and indirectly by regulating the expression of terminal selector TFs. Further, we find that NFYA-1 regulation of neuronal gene expression is important for neuronal activity and motor function. Thus, our research sheds light on how global neuronal gene expression programs are buffered through direct and indirect regulatory mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The cytoplasm is highly compartmentalized, but the extent and consequences of subcytoplasmic mRNA localization in non-polarized cells are largely unknown. We determined mRNA enrichment in TIS granules (TGs) and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through particle sorting and isolated cytosolic mRNAs by digitonin extraction. When focusing on genes that encode non-membrane proteins, we observed that 52% have transcripts enriched in specific compartments. Compartment enrichment correlates with a combinatorial code based on mRNA length, exon length, and 3′ UTR-bound RNA-binding proteins. Compartment-biased mRNAs differ in the functional classes of their encoded proteins: TG-enriched mRNAs encode low-abundance proteins with strong enrichment of transcription factors, whereas ER-enriched mRNAs encode large and highly expressed proteins. Compartment localization is an important determinant of mRNA and protein abundance, which is supported by reporter experiments showing that redirecting cytosolic mRNAs to the ER increases their protein expression. In summary, the cytoplasm is functionally compartmentalized by local translation environments.

Abstract: Summary
Cell invasion is a multi-step process, initiated by the acquisition of a migratory phenotype and the ability to move through complex 3D extracellular environments. We determine the composition of cell-matrix adhesion complexes of invasive breast cancer cells in 3D matrices and identify an interaction complex required for invasive migration. βPix and myosin18A (Myo18A) drive polarized recruitment of non-muscle myosin 2A (NM2A) to adhesion complexes at the tips of protrusions. Actomyosin force engagement then displaces the Git1-βPix complex from paxillin, establishing a feedback loop for adhesion maturation. We observe active force transmission to the nucleus during invasive migration that is needed to pull the nucleus forward. The recruitment of NM2A to adhesions creates a non-muscle myosin isoform gradient, which extends from the protrusion to the nucleus. We postulate that this gradient facilitates coupling of cell-matrix interactions at the protrusive cell front with nuclear movement, enabling effective invasive migration and front-rear cell polarity.

Abstract: Summary
Inborn errors of human IFN-γ-dependent macrophagic immunity underlie mycobacterial diseases, whereas inborn errors of IFN-α/β-dependent intrinsic immunity underlie viral diseases. Both types of IFNs induce the transcription factor IRF1. We describe unrelated children with inherited complete IRF1 deficiency and early-onset, multiple, life-threatening diseases caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria and related intramacrophagic pathogens. These children have no history of severe viral disease, despite exposure to many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which is life-threatening in individuals with impaired IFN-α/β immunity. In leukocytes or fibroblasts stimulated in vitro, IRF1-dependent responses to IFN-γ are, both quantitatively and qualitatively, much stronger than those to IFN-α/β. Moreover, IRF1-deficient mononuclear phagocytes do not control mycobacteria and related pathogens normally when stimulated with IFN-γ. By contrast, IFN-α/β-dependent intrinsic immunity to nine viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, is almost normal in IRF1-deficient fibroblasts. Human IRF1 is essential for IFN-γ-dependent macrophagic immunity to mycobacteria, but largely redundant for IFN-α/β-dependent antiviral immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Gas vesicles are gas-filled nanocompartments that allow a diverse group of bacteria and archaea to control their buoyancy. The molecular basis of their properties and assembly remains unclear. Here, we report the 3.2 Å cryo-EM structure of the gas vesicle shell made from the structural protein GvpA that self-assembles into hollow helical cylinders closed off by cone-shaped tips. Two helical half shells connect through a characteristic arrangement of GvpA monomers, suggesting a mechanism of gas vesicle biogenesis. The fold of GvpA features a corrugated wall structure typical for force-bearing thin-walled cylinders. Small pores enable gas molecules to diffuse across the shell, while the exceptionally hydrophobic interior surface effectively repels water. Comparative structural analysis confirms the evolutionary conservation of gas vesicle assemblies and demonstrates molecular features of shell reinforcement by GvpC. Our findings will further research into gas vesicle biology and facilitate molecular engineering of gas vesicles for ultrasound imaging.

These problems are in part due to the absence of synergistic cues of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). We report on the use of three artificial ECMs based on peptide amphiphile (PA) supramolecular nanofibers. All nanofibers display the laminin-derived IKVAV signal on their surface but differ in the nature of their non-bioactive domains. We find that nanofibers with greater intensity of internal supramolecular motion have enhanced bioactivity toward hiPSC-derived motor and cortical neurons. Proteomic, biochemical, and functional assays reveal that highly mobile PA scaffolds caused enhanced β1-integrin pathway activation, reduced aggregation, increased arborization, and matured electrophysiological activity of neurons. Our work highlights the importance of designing biomimetic ECMs to study the development, function, and dysfunction of human neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Public health studies indicate that artificial light is a high-risk factor for metabolic disorders. However, the neural mechanism underlying metabolic modulation by light remains elusive. Here, we found that light can acutely decrease glucose tolerance (GT) in mice by activation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) innervating the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON). Vasopressin neurons in the SON project to the paraventricular nucleus, then to the GABAergic neurons in the solitary tract nucleus, and eventually to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Light activation of this neural circuit directly blocks adaptive thermogenesis in BAT, thereby decreasing GT. In humans, light also modulates GT at the temperature where BAT is active. Thus, our work unveils a retina-SON-BAT axis that mediates the effect of light on glucose metabolism, which may explain the connection between artificial light and metabolic dysregulation, suggesting a potential prevention and treatment strategy for managing glucose metabolic disorders.
