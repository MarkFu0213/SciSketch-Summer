Abstract: The carrier transport through the silicon-oxide (SiOx) layer in tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) c-Si solar cells has been studied experimentally and by simulation. The current intensity versus voltage (J-V) characteristics of GaIn/n-c-Si/SiOx/n+-poly-Si/Al structures shows a linear Ohmic characteristic, while a non-Ohmic behavior is observed in the samples without the n+-poly-Si contact layer. Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (c-AFM) images reveal some current spikes on the surface of the samples, which could be related to the transport through pinholes. The simulation results show that 1) a rectification characteristic is obtained when only the tunneling mechanism is included, 2) both the reverse saturation current and the forward current increase when a small amount of transport through pinholes is introduced, and 3) finally a linear Ohmic behavior is observed when the pinhole transport component reaches a certain level. Furthermore, the simulation for whole TOPCon solar cells provides some useful results. For very thin SiOx (< 1.2 nm), the tunneling provides sufficient high tunneling probability and high efficiency TOPCon solar cells can be obtained without transport through pinholes if the passivation is ensured; while for a relatively thick SiOx (> 1.2 nm) without the transport through pinholes, the TOPCon solar cell shows a poor fill factor (FF) with a high series resistance (Rs) because the tunneling does not provide a sufficient high transport channel for carrier transport, and the introduction of a small number of transports through pinholes improves the FF and reduces the Rs, hence improves the PCE. However, a high possibility for carrier going through pinholes reduces all of the performance parameters and degrades PCE for all the cases simulated. Therefore, an optimized pinhole density and size distribution is critical engineering for solar cell performance optimization. However, the establishment of an optimized method to precisely control the pinhole formation and characterization is still on the way.

Abstract: Considerable effort has been devoted to the characterization of thermal properties of the different types of materials that can be used as thermal energy storage (TES) media, but scarce literature exists concerning the materials to manufacture the tanks that can be used to contain these storage media. One of the main concerns when selecting the most suitable material for these tanks is its resistance to corrosion due to molten salts that constitute the TES system. Dynamic gravimetric analysis is a newly proposed method for the study of corrosion on metals, which optimizes the standard procedure described by ASTM G1–03. The new technique avoids the direct handling of samples, so more accurate values can be obtained. In this work, the resistance to corrosion of AISI 316 stainless steel samples in contact with commercial grade molten salts of the Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 system, at 600 °C for different exposure times, has been determined by using this new methodology. The results show that the initial corrosion rate is lower at higher amounts of lithium carbonate present in the molten salts mixture.

Abstract: Chemoresistance to the anticancer therapy is the main challenge for the recurrence of cancer and it is responsible for treatment failure and unfavorable clinical outcome. Understanding the mechanisms of chemoresistance in cancer would help to predict disease progression, develop new therapies and personalize systemic therapy. In the last few decades, cancer stem cells (CSC) have proven to play a key role in tumor initiation and may also act as a key factor for chemoresistance and recurrence of the disease following chemotherapy. Resistance to anticancer therapy in patients has been attributed towards a number of factors controlling the stemness character of the cancer stem cells which leads to therapeutic resistance. Accumulating evidences show that the bone marrow (BM) niche is critical to the maintenance and retention of cancer stem cells. Undeniably, stromal cells within the BM niche provide a sanctuary where different signaling pathways and cell-cell interaction gives a protective nature to the diseased condition, and thereby evade chemotherapy-induced death. In this review we have tried to highlight the factors which have important role in chemoresistance and are associated with bone marrow microenvironment. We have also discussed about the recent progresses regarding CSC-targeted therapies to throw light toward developing more effective therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer in the patients concerned.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) has a negative impact on clinical outcomes for patients with myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to assess whether decreased myocardial levels of Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) contribute to the increased susceptibility of the diabetic myocardium to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In vivo, myocardial levels of Sirt1 expression and activity were decreased in mice with STZ-induced DM. Increasing Sirt1 activity prevented the DM-induced exacerbation of myocardial mitochondrial fission, apoptosis and dysfunction elicited by I/R. In vitro, anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) challenge of cardiomyocytes (CM) that were preconditioned with high glucose (HG-CM) resulted in an exacerbation of the A/R-induced mitochondrial fission, oxidant production and CM apoptosis; effects reversed by increasing Sirt1 protein/activity. Inhibition of Drp1 prevented the exacerbated CM mitochondrial fission and oxidant production after A/R challenge of HG-CM. Decreased Sirt1 in HG-CM was associated with decreased Akt phosphorylation. Inhibition of Akt had no effect on CM Sirt1 levels, but further increased Drp1 activation. Increasing Sirt1 levels prevented the decrease in Akt phosphorylation and Drp1 activation in A/R challenged HG-CM. In conclusion: our data indicate that the increased vulnerability of the diabetic myocardium to I/R-induced apoptosis/dysfunction is attributable, in part, to decreased myocardial Sirt1 activity which leads to a decrease in Akt activation, an increase in Drp1 activity, culminating in excessive mitochondrial fission and ROS production.

Abstract: Field effect passivation of crystalline silicon surface is controlled by tailoring the built-in charge in a bilayer dielectric system consisting of hafnium oxide (HfO2) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3). The effective surface recombination velocity (Seff, max) ~ 10 cm/s is achieved at intermediate bulk injection levels with thermal ALD deposited HfO2 (top)/Al2O3 (bottom) bilayer system on n-type silicon with individual layer thickness between 3 and 7 nm. The best realized Seff,max value is lower by a factor of ~ 2.5 with respect to the single Al2O3 layer of similar thickness deposited under the same experimental conditions. The improved field effect passivation is quantified by enhanced effective charge density for the bilayer system in comparison with the corresponding value for single Al2O3 layer. The introduction of extra trap centers at the interface of the bilayer system is primarily responsible for the enriched field effect passivation, however, the sequence of the dielectric layers is important.

Abstract: Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) constitute a promising technology to allow solar energy to be competitive in the power generation market. Despite its huge potential, this technology remains hindered by practical issues degrading electrical performances. Among the main limiting factors, light non-uniformity is an important source of energy losses in all CPV systems. Indeed, at the cell level, this non-uniformity induces hot spots, current mismatch between subcells and increased resistive losses. Losses due to non-uniformity have already been studied in the case of common multi-junction solar cells with frontal grid contacts. In this work, we demonstrate that the new architecture based on through-cell vias contacts (TCVC) has a great potential to enhance robustness of CPV cells relative to non-uniformity. Using a simulation approach, we show that under a medium concentration factor (500X) and moderate non-uniformity level, a variant of TCVC cells with metallized cross fingers (CF-TCVC) undergoes almost no degradation of its performances. Even under highly non-uniform light, the CF-TCVC cell efficiency degradation is less than 0.7%abs while this degradation reaches 1.6%abs for an equivalent standard grid cell. The advantage of the TCVC architecture becomes even more significant under highly concentrated light (2000X) as the efficiency degradation of these cells is 1.2%abs lower than for standard cells. We demonstrate that the better behavior of TCVC cells under non-uniform light could be explained by their more evenly polarized surface, indicating lower resistive losses and a better collection of current.

Abstract: Homozygous and/or heterozygous loss of function mutations in the natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR2) have been reported in causing acromesomelic dysplasia, type Maroteaux with variable clinical features and idiopathic short stature with nonspecific skeletal deformities. On the other hand, gain of function mutations in the same gene result in overgrowth disorder suggesting that NPR2 and its ligand, natriuretic peptide precursor C (CNP), are the key players of endochondral bone growth. However, the precise mechanism behind phenotypic variability of the NPR2 mutations is not fully understood so far. In the present study, three consanguineous families of Pakistani origin (A, B, C) with variable phenotypes of acromesomelic dysplasia, type Maroteaux were evaluated at clinical and molecular levels. Linkage analysis followed by Sanger sequencing of the NPR2 gene revealed three homozygous mutations including p.(Leu314 Arg), p.(Arg371*), and p.(Arg1032*) in family A, B and C, respectively. In silico structural and functional analyses substantiated that a novel missense mutation [p.(Leu314 Arg)] in family A allosterically affects binding of NPR2 homodimer to its ligand (CNP) which ultimately results in defective guanylate cyclase activity. A nonsense mutation [p.(Arg371*)] in family B entirely removed the transmembrane domain, protein kinase domain and guanylate cyclase domains of the NPR2 resulting in abolishing its guanylate cyclase activity. Another novel mutation [p.(Arg1032*)], found in family C, deteriorated the guanylate cyclase domain of the protein and probably plundered its guanylate cyclase activity. These results suggest that guanylate cyclase activity is the most critical function of the NPR2 and phenotypic severity of the NPR2 mutations is proportional to the reduction in its guanylate cyclase activity.

Abstract: Organic solar cells have attracted much attention in the recent years due to their many intrinsic advantages, such as, light weight, flexibility, low-cost, solution processing, and facile device fabrication. In this study, effective interface engineering was employed to improve all the photovoltaic parameters of an organic solar cell simultaneously by incorporating ZnO nanoparticle (ZnO-NP) interlayer in between the indium tin oxide cathode and sol-gel processed ZnO electron transport layer. The significance of incorporating a ZnO-NP/ZnO bilayer as the electron transport layer in the bulk heterojunction organic solar cells was demonstrated via systematic study, employing a high efficiency photoactive layer system (PBDB-T:ITIC). The bilayer electron transport layer demonstrated reduced work function compared to the sol-gel ZnO, which enabled effective electron transfer from the active layer to the electron transport layer. In addition, improved bilayer surface morphology, via reduction of ZnO-NP layer roughness, and better crystallinity compared to sol-gel ZnO facilitated charge separation and transmission between electron transport layer and active layer. Consequently, the devices with bilayer interlayer exhibited an enhancement of > 13% in power conversion efficiency compared to the control devices with sol-gel only ZnO as electron transport layer. The mechanisms behind the improvement in device performance were analysed using the ultraviolet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The champion bilayer device exhibited 12.24% efficiency which is much higher than the efficiency of 10.69% for the control device.

Abstract: Soiling of PV modules decreases their energy yield by blocking sunlight and is a serious problem in regions with high aerosol concentrations and little rain such as arid and semi-arid climates. Due to many influencing factors, which are often site-dependent, the complex processes of soiling are not fully understood. In order to approach this goal, detailed knowledge and analysis of the various influencing parameters at a microscopic level are necessary. In this study we present results of outdoor experiments to reveal the physical mechanisms of soiling-layer formation on exposed glass surfaces. The experiments were conducted at a PV test site in Doha, Qatar, and included sample cooling, heating and cleaning. Detailed microstructural investigations of the soiling layers were performed to study cementation of dust particles. To achieve a better understanding of the underlying processes, we provide an analysis of environmental parameters (relative humidity, ambient and module temperatures, wind speed) with special focus on dew formation, as well as dust characteristics (chemical composition, mineralogy, size distribution), which influence cementation and optical losses. In addition, we compare results of different methods for soiling-rate determination including light microscopy, spectroscopy, gravimetry and PV power analysis to determine the relation between micro-scale soiling measurements and actual PV energy losses. The results show that in Qatar, dew formation frequently occurs and leads to particle cementation by needle-shaped crystals of the clay mineral palygorskite, which directly precipitates at the glass surface. It is shown that preventing dew formation by sample heating inhibits cementation and can significantly reduce dust accumulation. Based on these findings, new mitigation approaches for PV soiling are proposed.

Abstract: We performed an extensive study of light induced degradation experiments in PERC solar cells made of Boron doped Cz Silicon material from several experimental crystals. Strong LeTID (Light and Elevated Temperature Induced Degradation) amplitudes were found in cells originating from the top and tail part of the crystals. A statistical analysis reveals a strong correlation to the bulk concentration of Aluminium in cells originating from wafers close to the tail. Close to the top, the LeTID effect is strongly enhanced whenever Oxygen precipitation occurs in the cell process.

Abstract: In this study, we have investigated the effect of SiOx thickness (1–3 nm) on the performance of polycrystalline (poly) Si/SiOx/monocrystalline Si (c-Si) passivated contacts. Our results show that for both n- and p-type contacts, there is an optimum SiOx thickness of 1.4–1.6 nm for obtaining the highest implied open-circuit voltage (i-Voc) values of ~739 and ~700 mV, respectively. For contacts with SiOx thicker than 1.6 nm, the i-Voc drops due to reduced field-effect passivation. We attribute this to the fact that a thicker SiOx layer hinders the diffusion of both n- and p-type dopants into the c-Si wafer resulting in a junction that is very close to the c-Si/SiOx interface, which increases carrier recombination most likely due to the presence of defects at this interface. The resistivity measured through the metal/poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si stack is independent of SiOx thickness up to 1.6 nm, and increases exponentially by several orders of magnitude with further increase in SiOx thickness due to inefficient tunneling transport. Finally, the extent of metallization-induced degradation of the poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si contacts is worst for the thinnest SiOx investigated (~1 nm), and interestingly it is not completely mitigated even for a ~3 nm thick SiOx.

Abstract: The electron-transport layer (ETL) between the PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) active layer and the FTO substrate plays a crucial role in the associated heterojunction photovoltaics. However, the presence of surface defects in the ETL limits the performance of the photovoltaics. Herein, we report the improved carrier extraction at the TiO2/PbS interface of planar PbS CQDs photovoltaics, which can be easily accomplished through pre-implanting thermally stable hydroxyl radicals on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) for constructing ETL. The pre-implantations on the surface of TiO2 NPs realized using HNO3 aqueous solution treatment under the hydrothermal condition surprisingly wouldn’t be completely removed after the annealing procedure necessary for preparing the conventional ETL, and effectively eliminate the interband trap sites of the TiO2 NPs by passivating intrinsic oxygen-deficient defects for achieving well-matched electron affinity and work function. As expected, the interfacial bimolecular recombination events are obviously suppressed thanks to the well-acceptable trap densities existing in TiO2 ETL as well as favorable interfacial band alignment for carrier extraction. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is pushed up to 9.31%, much better than the control competitors. Undoubtedly, this work provides another opportunity for optimizing performance of the relevant PbS CQDs photovoltaics resorting to interface engineering guideline.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum stress has been considered a major cause of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis leading to diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation and chemical chaperones have been known to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve β-cell function and survival. The purpose of this study was to prepare and evaluate the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid-conjugated exendin-4 as a protective agent for pancreatic β-cells. Mono-tauroursodeoxycholic acid-Lys27-exendin-4 conjugate (TUM1-Ex4) showed better receptor binding affinity than other conjugates with strong in vitro insulinotropic activity in rat pancreatic β-cells and in vivo hypoglycemic activity in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. In INS-1 cells under endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by thapsigargin, TUM1-Ex4 promoted cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. In western blot analysis, TUM1-Ex4 reduced the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker GRP78 and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. These results reveal that TUM1-Ex4 accelerates translational recovery and contributes to β-cell protection and survival. The present study indicates that the chemical chaperone-coupled glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist is a feasible therapeutic strategy to enhance β-cell function and survival.

Abstract: Treatment for type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) decreases morbidity from hematological cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly and bone complications. Consequently, untreated symptomatic patients for study of late outcomes are hard to find. We identified 184 untreated GD1 patients (67.4% Ashkenazi; splenectomy 51.1%) who died between 1950 and 2010. Here, we report confirmed causes of death for these patients compared with the overall US population. Median age of death 66years (2–97years); causes of death (COD) with a high proportional mortality rate (PMR) included malignancies (PMR 1.57), suicide/drug overdose (PMR 3.86), liver disease (PMR 4.76) and septicemia (PMR 9.22). PMRs for CNS/gastrointestinal bleeding, pulmonary hypertension, post-splenectomy complications and Parkinsonism were also increased. PMR for heart disease (0.33) was significantly decreased. Average age at death was normal for heart disease, septicemia, suicide, and malignancies but younger for liver disease and Parkinsonism. COD more prevalent in splenectomy patients included liver disease, septicemia, pulmonary hypertension and GI bleeding. With timely diagnosis, improved risk assessment and obsolescence of splenectomy, GD1-associated malignancies, liver disease, septicemia, pulmonary hypertension, suicide and drug dependency may decrease with early institution of appropriate treatment. Our population of untreated patients is a valuable historical control for studies of the effect of GD1 treatment on premature mortality.

Abstract: Light-harvesting material Sb2S3 has recently attracted tremendous attention due to its excellent photovoltaic properties. Extensive efforts have been exerted to improve the power conversion efficiency through process innovation, interface modification and band gap engineering. In this study, we report an all-inorganic planar heterojunction Sb2S3 solar cell using NiOx as hole extraction material, which is deposited from preformed NiOx nanoparticle solution. We demonstrate that the device performance can be significantly enhanced upon O2 plasma treatment on NiOx layer. As a result, O2 plasma-treated NiOx hole conductor leads to a 43% enhancement in power conversion efficiency when compared to untreated one, delivering an efficiency of 3.51%. The enhancement mechanisms are interpreted in terms of electronic structures and interfacial charge transport properties characterized by synchrotron-based high resolution ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work provides a choice of novel inorganic hole-transporting material for the preparation of stable and efficient all-inorganic solar cell device based on Sb2S3 as well as Sb2(S,Se)3.

Abstract: Paper-based flexible thin film solar cells are promising power sources for the emerging portable and wearable electronics, for which high conversion efficiency and flexibility are demanded. Herein, flexible thin film silicon solar cells using textured aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) for light scattering, and ultrathin silver electrodes combined with cellophane paper substrates, were demonstrated. A universal route to form textured AZO thin film by chemical etching with hydrochloric acid vapor was proposed. The AZO layers textured in this way exhibited similar light scattering properties as compared with state-of-the-art AZO thin films. Applying textured AZO to solar cells on cellophane paper substrates resulted in current density and conversion efficiency increase from 8.7 to 9.5 mA/cm2 and from 4.1% to 5.7%, respectively. Thin film solar cells on cellophane exhibited excellent mechanical flexibility, which maintained 90% of their initial efficiency after bending at a radius of 1 mm for 50 cycles.

Abstract: C-terminal mutations of the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM) are the most frequent genetic aberration detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with normal karyotype. The mutations cause aberrant cytoplasmic localization of NPM and lead to loss of functions associated with NPM nucleolar localization, e.g. in ribosome biogenesis or DNA-damage repair. NPM has many interaction partners and some of them were proved to interact also with the mutated form (NPMmut) and due to this interaction thereby to be withdrawn from their site of action. We analyzed the impact of the mutation on NPM interaction with nucleolin (NCL) which is also prevalently localized into the nucleolus and cooperates with wild-type NPM (NPMwt) in many cellular processes. We revealed that the NCL-NPM complex formation is completely abolished by the mutation and that the presence/absence of the interaction is not affected by drugs causing genotoxic stress or differentiation. Deregulation resulting from changes of NCL/NPMwt ratio may contribute to leukemogenesis.

Abstract: Background
Neuronopathic Gaucher disease type 3 (GD3) is frequent in northern Sweden, whereas GD1 is found throughout the country. In a nation-wide study, we examined neurological manifestations and clinical course in 12 patients with GD3 and 13 patients with GD1.
Methods
The patients were evaluated by standardized neurological assessments. Every sixth month, the GD3 patients were rated with the modified Severity Scoring Tool. At baseline and at the 3years follow-up, patients underwent University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. When clinical signs were present, additional examinations were undertaken.
Results
Marked clinical heterogeneity was evident in both GD3 and GD1 groups. Several GD3 patients had a hitherto unreported rapid and repetitive dystonia-like hyperkinetic movement disorder. Most patients with GD3 have abnormalities of horizontal gaze, ataxia and focal epilepsy, some also had cognitive impairment, anxiety and hyposmia. Six GD3 patients, all homoallelic for L444P GBA1 mutations, have lived beyond 40years of age; and none has developed Parkinsonism. Two of the GD1 patients suffer from Parkinsonism; mild to complete hyposmia was present in six GD3 and five GD1 patients. Neither the group of GD3 nor GD1 patients had detectable progression of their neurological manifestations.
Conclusions
These middle-aged and older Swedish GD3 or GD1 patients are clinically stable over time. However, we have identified unusual clinical features, discordant phenotypes and a hyperkinetic dystonia-like movement disorder which appears unique to this Swedish disease variant and expands the phenotype for GD.

Abstract: Fracture in silicon crystalline solar cells has been a long-standing challenge encountered in the photovoltaic (PV) industry. This occurs as result of stresses developing in the cells due to thermo-mechanical stresses that arise when there is a mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the different constituent materials during the manufacturing processes as well as mechanical stresses from hail, snow and wind during field operations. Through finite element simulations, this paper investigates the effect of interconnect cross-sectional geometry on stresses developed in silicon cells during the entire PV manufacturing cycle and provides physical reasoning to its stress evolution. The simulations are performed in a sequential manner whereby the residual stresses developed at the end of one step is brought forward to the beginning of the next step. It is found that the highest cell stresses occur at the back surfaces of the cells at the end of the pressure-ramping step during lamination. In addition, increasing the thickness of the front interconnects significantly increases the stresses developed in the cells during lamination. This predicted trend is verified experimentally.

Abstract: An electrochromic device, capable of three-level color switching, has been envisaged by exploiting different color switching properties of Ethyl viologen (EV) and Poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to make them switch in congruence with each other. The device, consisting of an EV/P3HT bilayer in poly-ethylene oxide matrix, appears magenta, blue or transparent under an appropriate bias. The unbiased device shows magenta colored appearance and turns transparent at a bias of 1 V when P3HT layer is used as anode. The device turns blue on increasing the bias to 1.4 V without changing the polarity. The mechanism of multilevel switching has been identified using UV–Vis and Raman spectroscopic investigations which reveal that the 1 V bias converts the P3HT into polarons and 1.4 V converts the EV dications (EV2+) into free radical. The electrochromic device demonstrates better color contrast (~ 50%) in both the optical domains. The fabricated device shows better switching speeds of ~ 1.5 s and good stability and coloration efficiency along with three-level color switching. However the reported device uses ITO coated glass as substrate, it can be used for all-organic flexible electrochromic device.

Abstract: Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protist responsible for human trichomoniasis. T. vaginalis has three genes encoding for endogenous cysteine proteinase (CP) inhibitors, known as trichocystatin-1 through trichocystatin-3 (TC-1, TC-2, and TC-3). These inhibitors belong to the cystatin family. In this study, we characterized trichocystatin-3 (TC-3), an endogenous cysteine proteinase (CP) inhibitor of T. vaginalis. TC-3 possesses a signal peptide in the N-terminus and two putative glycosylation sites (typical of family 2, cystatins) but lacks the PW motif and cysteine residues (typical of family 1, stefins). Native TC-3 was recognized as an ∼18 kDa protein band in a T. vaginalis protein extract. By confocal microscopy, endogenous TC-3 was found in the Golgi complex, cytoplasm, large vesicles, and the plasma membrane. These localizations are consistent with an in silico prediction. In addition, the purified recombinant protein (TC-3r) functions as an inhibitor of cathepsin L CPs, such as human liver cathepsin L and trichomonad CPs, present in a proteinase-resistant extract (PRE). Via a pull-down assay using TC-3r as bait and PRE, we identified several trichomonad CPs targeted by TC-3, primarily TvCP3. These CP-TC-3 interactions occur in vesicles, in the cytoplasm, and on the parasite surface. In addition, TC-3r showed a protective effect on HeLa cell monolayers by inhibiting trichomonad surface CPs involved in cellular damage. Our results show that the endogenous inhibitor TC-3 plays a key role in the regulation of endogenous CP proteolytic activity.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an effective emitter passivation scheme using SiO2/Al2O3/SiNx stacks. Our study shows that SiO2/Al2O3/SiNx stacks can well passivate both p+ and n+ emitters due to an excellent chemical passivation combined with a weak field-effect passivation. Good quality boron and phosphorus emitters were achieved over a broad emitter-doping range, as demonstrated by post-fired emitter saturation current of 20 and 30 fA cm−2, respectively. Based on the results obtained with SiO2/Al2O3/SiNx emitter passivation, we present an industrial roadmap for a p-PERT bifacial cell structure. Using this roadmap, we demonstrate industrial p-PERT bifacial cells with front side efficiency of 20.5%, rear side efficiency of 19.8% (bifaciality factor BF = 0.98) for rear textured cells and 17.5% (BF = 0.85) for rear planar cells. In particular, the cells with bifacial SiO2/Al2O3/SiNx passivation on both p+ and n+ emitters also demonstrate promising performance and a simplified cell process. The results show that SiO2/Al2O3/SiNx emitter passivation scheme is a promising candidate for photovoltaic industry.

Abstract: Cytochrome P450s are involved in a variety of monooxygenation reactions that require electron transfer from one redox partner to the other. We have recently shown the catalytic mechanism of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase like protein (encoded by tri11 gene) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (EPT) to produce trichodermol in the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway of trichodermin and harzianum A in Trichoderma brevicompactum [J Biol Inorg Chem. 22(8):1197-1209. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00775-017-1496-6]. In the present work we have analyzed the effects of interaction of CPR FMN domain, a redox partner of tri11 protein, on its catalysis. The analysis of protein-protein complex interface showed various important contacts between the two protein partners that may aid in the process of electron transfer. The redox partner binding with tri11 protein on proximal side elicited catalytically important changes on the oppositely situated distal side that may help in stabilizing the active site and may play positive roles during the catalysis.

Abstract: Diamond-wire-sawing (DWS) processes have been developed in recent years to overcome the problems of silicon (Si) waste and low throughput of the conventional multi-wire-slurry-sawing (MWSS) process for cutting Si ingots into wafers. However, DWS is not adopted extensively by PV industry as standard alkaline texturing is not directly applicable to these wafers to generate regular pyramidal structure. In the present work we are reporting a novel low-cost alkaline texturing process for industrial DWS monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers. Our process has three novelties; firstly, it uses a low-cost saw damage removal (SDR) process with a new recipe of potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hypochlorite solution at 80 °C for slow Si etching. This process also successfully removes the amorphous Si layer normally present on the as-cut DWC Si wafer surface. Secondly, no initial cleaning process is required before our SDR process. Finally, a high throughput KOH/isopropyl alcohol/potassium silicate texturing process was applied successfully for pyramid formation on the DWS c-Si wafers. Small (~2–4 µm in height) and uniform pyramidal structure with reduced surface reflectance is confirmed by scanning electron microscope, Zeta 3D measurement and UV–Vis spectroscopy studies. Further, photoluminescence (PL) imaging of lifetime samples prepared with the present texturisation process, confirmed the uniformity of surface passivation, a prerequisite for solar cell fabrication. Screen-printed solar cells were fabricated in NCPRE cell fabrication laboratory. For our 6 in. pseudo-square CZ p-type c-Si wafers cell efficiencies up to 18.5% were achieved with the new texturing process. This high throughput novel texturing process thus can easily be integrated into the standard industrial process.

Abstract: Cells contain a variety of proteins, including those forming a cellular defense system against oxidative stress and DNA damage. In this study, we examined the antibacterial effect of Tat (47–58) peptide, a cell-penetrating peptide, derived from human immunodeficiency virus-1 by focusing on the glutathione and SOS response. First, total glutathione levels were measured to reveal the cellular defense capacity against oxidative stress. Tat (47–58) decreased total glutathione and generated excessive reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative damage. Second, the expression of RecA protein, which activates the SOS response system in bacterial cells, was detected. Tat (47–58) induced the expression of RecA protein by damaging chromatin and DNA; these actions were confirmed by DAPI and TUNEL staining. Moreover, membrane depolarization and phosphatidylserine exposure, regarded as apoptotic markers, were observed in Tat (47–58)-treated cells. In conclusion, the bactericidal action of Tat (47–58) attenuated the cellular defense systems, including the antioxidant defense system and DNA repair system, and induced apoptosis-like death of Escherichia coli.

Abstract: Background
The storage of glucosylceramide in macrophages produces an inflammatory response in Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) resulting in iron metabolism dysregulation and cytokine release.
Patients and methods
The study included 16 adults with GD1 aged 20–86years. All but one patient carried at least one allele with the c.1226A>G (N370S) mutation in the GBA1 gene. Ferritinemia, iron metabolism profiles including hepcidin, and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were assessed in GD1 patients in Sweden.
Results
Hyperferritinemia was present in 81% of patients. There was no correlation between hyperferritinemia and patient's gender, spleen status, or clinical status. Hepcidin was discrepantly low in relation to ferritin levels. TNF-α was moderately increased in 5 of 11 patients; 2 patients with the highest TNF-α concentrations showed mildly elevated IL-6 levels. The concentrations of IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-10 were normal in all patients. Upon treatment, ferritinemia ameliorated but S-ferritin levels did not normalize. The increased TNF-α level however, normalized in all treated patients, reaching the lowest values after 2years of therapy and continued to be stable during the remaining 2years of follow-up.
Conclusions
Hyperferritinemia is a frequent finding in GD1 in Sweden. The relatively low hepcidin levels reveal a distorted relationship between hepcidin and ferritin in GD1. Therapy has the potential to not only ameliorate hyperferritinemia but to also normalize the serum TNF-α concentration in GD1.

Abstract: This study aims to fully investigate the radiative characterization of ceramic foams in terms of local scale (single strut) and macro scale (foam sheet). A radiative transfer model was established in the limit of geometric optics for a porous structure obtained from real alumina ceramic foams by computed tomography technique. The model considers the reflection and refraction at solid-void interface and the volumetric transmission, absorption and scattering process inside semitransparent ceramic solids. It is found that at local scale, neglecting the real hollowness may bring considerable errors to the local radiative behavior of ceramic struts (maximum errors up to 20.4–39.3% for the cases investigated). The cross-sectional thickness of the strut increases from the middle to the extremities, which causes a significant variation of the local radiative behavior. At macro scale, a peak in transmittivity of foam sheet can be observed at the wavelength around 4.4 µm. The scattering albedos obtained from the predictive model indicate that alumina ceramic foams behave strongly scattering within the wavelength 4 µm but very absorbing over 6 µm. The asymmetry factors obtained show a turning point at the wavelength around 1.8 µm, suggesting a transition of the scattered radiation from backward predominance to forward predominance.

Abstract: Deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, β-glucocerebrosidase, and accumulation of its substrate in cells of the reticuloendothelial system affects multiple organ systems in patients with Gaucher disease (GD). Lipid laden macrophages turn into Gaucher cells (GC) which are the pathological characteristic of GD. GC focally accumulate in the liver, spleen and at extraosseous sites to form benign lesions called Gaucheromas. Gaucheromas pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We studied the pathophysiology of extraosseous Gaucheroma formation in a cohort of patients with GD. Among 63 patients followed at a single center, 3 patients with genotypes L444P/L444P and N370S/N370S, were diagnosed with extraosseous Gaucheromas. Flow cytometry revealed a higher expression of CD16+/CCR4+ non-classical monocytes in blood of GD patients who have developed Gaucheromas. A biopsy showed infiltration of GC, which reactivity against CD163, CD68 and VEGF. The cell proliferative marker Ki67 and CCL2, a factor anti-tumor activity, were negative. Our study indicates that extraosseous Gaucheromas are comprised of cellular elements with characteristics of tumor-associated macrophages, the major players in cancer related inflammation. The occurrence of non-classical CD16+/CCR4+ monocytes reflect the underlying cause for the accumulation of the macrophages capable of migrating to distant sites outside the reticuloendotheial system, and giving rise to tumor-like Gaucheromas.

Abstract: In this work we present a method to grow Sb2Se3 thin films with a potential use as absorber layers in solar cell structures. The films were grown on several substrates: soda-lime glass, Mo coated soda-lime glass and Si. The Sb-Se precursor's films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering and then selenized under a H2Se gas flow. Different selenization temperatures were tested and analysed. Compositional and morphological analyses were performed by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy, respectively. Phase identification and structural characterization were done by X-ray Diffraction and Raman scattering spectroscopy showing that Sb2Se3 is the dominant phase with an orthorhombic crystalline structure. Traces of rhombohedral and amorphous Se secondary phases were also observed supported by their Se-rich compositions. Visible-NIR reflectance measurements allowed to extract a direct bandgap with a value close to 1.06 eV. Photoluminescence spectroscopy shows an emission with a broad band at 0.85 eV for samples selenized at lower temperatures and an intense peak at 0.75 eV for the sample selenized at higher temperatures. Electrical characterization shows low free hole concentrations and mobilities. At low temperatures, the nearest neighbour hopping is the dominant mechanism for the electronic transport for the analysed samples. Both electrical and optical properties are influenced by the type of defects present on samples. A discussion is made on the properties that need to be improved in order that these films can be integrated into thin film solar cells.

Abstract: Background Cluster of differentiation 40 ligand (CD40L) and rosuvastatin (RSV) affect atherosclerotic plaque stability, but little is known about their roles in extracellular matrix (ECM) production. We investigated the effects of CD40L and RSV on pre-existing advanced plaques. Methods and results Pre-existing advanced plaques were induced in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE−/−) mice by the surgical placement of carotid constrictive silastic collars. Two weeks after surgery, mice were divided into the following treatment groups: control, empty adenovirus, CD40L adenovirus, CD40L adenovirus + RSV, and RSV. Mice received adenovirus via two tail-vein injections (2 × 109 pfu each) and/or RSV via intragastric administration (5 mg/kg; daily for 4 weeks). Mice in the CD40L adenovirus group exhibited increased plaque disruption rates, increased relative plaque macrophage and lipid content, reduced plaque collagen content, and increased local inflammation compared to the other treatment groups, but no significant differences in plaque area were observed among the groups. Notably, in the atherosclerotic plaques of the CD40L adenovirus group, both the mRNA and protein expression of prolyl-4-hydroxylase alpha 1 (P4Hα1) was significantly decreased, leading to a consequent decrease in the protein expression of collagen types I and III. Treatment with RSV decreased the serum levels of CD40L in a lipid-independent fashion and attenuated the effects of CD40L overexpression, particularly with respect to P4Hα1 downregulation. Conclusions CD40L destabilized advanced plaques in the carotid arteries of ApoE−/− mice, in part by decreasing P4Hα1 expression, and consequently collagen expression. These destabilizing effects were attenuated by RSV.

Abstract: Intrinsic amorphous silicon provides excellent surface passivation on crystalline silicon. It has previously been shown, that carriers that are photo generated in the amorphous silicon can be efficiently electronically injected into the crystalline silicon. A method to quantify the efficiency of such carrier injection using the spectral response of photoluminescence has recently been demonstrated. This is a contactless method and it can be applied to incomplete device structures. Here we use this technique to measure partially processed heterojunction devices with different capping layers to quantify their impact on the carrier injection efficiency. Silicon nitride capping on amorphous silicon is shown to have minimum impact on the high carrier injection efficiency of the amorphous layer but doped amorphous capping layer on the other hand were seen to have a strong effect on the carrier injection efficiency. A model was developed to understand the material properties of the amorphous layer. The reduction in carrier injection efficiency with doped amorphous silicon capping layers were attributed to the large defects in the doped layer.

Abstract: Main-chain poly(ionic liquid)s based on 1,2,3-triazole with pentaoxyethylene spacer was developed via copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) of a novel azide/alkyne-terminal monomer and subsequently quaternized by alkyl halides followed by anion exchanges with several fluorinated salts. Introduction of the extended ethylene oxide fragments [–(CH2CH2O)5–] has made this new PIL with methyl substituent and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide counteranion exhibit ionic conductivity of 1.16 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C. This new electrolyte efficiently switches an electrochromic device (ECD) with 18% optical contrast from its transparent state to a colored state in 4.75 s and while bleaching takes 11.8 s. The development of this polyelectrolyte with simple structure and excellent physical and thermal properties is promising for the design of new all-solid state energy efficient smart windows and devices and other electrochemical device applications.

Abstract: Different surface passivation approaches are applied on Cz-Si and FZ-Si samples and long-term stability is investigated during treatments at 60–80 °C and up to 1 sun equivalent illumination intensity. It is shown that SiNx:H and AlOx:H/SiNx:H surface passivation show a much more stable passivation quality when deposited on P-diffused and B-diffused surfaces, respectively. Long-term measurements lead to the conclusion that Cz-Si samples fired at measured peak temperatures up to 750 °C are very stable after regeneration of bulk defects. Samples fired at 850 °C show much stronger bulk-related degradation potentially linked to light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID). Furthermore, Cz-Si samples fired at 850 °C express an instable behavior after a regeneration treatment.

Abstract: Adaptive materials active in the thermal infrared (IR) region have recently attracted intense research interest as they are suitable for adaptive IR camouflage applications, although significant challenges remain. Under external thermal stimuli, vanadium dioxide (VO2) thin films exhibit a reversible metal-insulator transition (MIT) from an IR transparent state to a reflecting state with heating. An alternative route is proposed for depositing thermochromic VO2(M) thin films on quartz substrates via the transformation of metastable VO2(B). A silicone elastomer sheet with high absorption in the IR region and high thermal conductivity was adhered to the back of a VO2/quartz structure to improve its thermochromic properties in the mid-wavelength (MWIR; 3–5 µm) and long-wavelength (LWIR; 8–14 µm) thermal atmospheric windows. The emissivity of the VO2(M)/quartz/silicone structure could change by 0.21 and 0.49 across MIT in the MWIR and LWIR ranges, respectively. This VO2/quartz/silicone structure showed IR chameleon-like behavior in the MWIR and LWIR atmospheric windows, respectively. When heated above the MIT temperature, the structure autonomously lowers its IR radiation intensity to appear to be at the same or even lower temperature on IR cameras. When the real temperature (Tr) of the object is 95 °C, the apparent temperature (Ta) on the MWIR camera is 51.9 °C close to the Ta of 51.8 °C at Tr = 65 °C; in the LWIR band, Ta is merely 43.8 °C when Tr is 90 °C, close to the Ta of 42.1 °C at Tr = 50 °C and even cooler than the Ta of 49.3 °C at Tr = 60 °C. These exciting results provide new opportunities for adaptive IR camouflage of military objects with dynamical temperature change and IR exposure for cheating IR cameras.

Abstract: In this study, several common plasmonic metals were compared for the development of a broadband absorber. It was found that a broadband absorption region, from 300 nm to 1500 nm, with average values of 89.9%, 91.0%, and 91.6%, was obtained for Ni, Ti, and W absorbers with high imaginary-part permittivities, respectively. The absorption peaks of Ag, Au, and Cu absorbers with low imaginary-part permittivities were mainly in a narrow visible region while the strong magnetic resonance was obtained in the broadband region. A detailed analysis indicated that the intrinsic absorption properties of the metal had a large effect on the broadband absorption ability of the simple-structure absorber and the metal with the high-imaginary-part-permittivity can reach a broadband absorption by the intrinsic absorption without enhanced magnetic resonance. Therefore, the high-imaginary-part-permittivity metal Ni was chosen to fabricate a broadband absorber; the geometric parameters of the Ni absorber were investigated by three-dimensional full-wave simulations to obtain a high-performance absorber. The detailed analysis indicated that the broadband-absorption mechanism can be attributed to the coupling effect of surface plasmon resonance, magnetic resonance, and intrinsic absorption of Ni. A high-performance solar absorber was proposed using Ni disks with two different sizes; the total solar thermal conversion efficiencies reached the values of 0.8909 and 0.8326 at operating temperatures of 800 K and 1000 K, respectively.

Abstract: In the last years, significant progress has been made regarding an understanding of light induced degradation at elevated temperature observed on PERC solar cells (LeTID). Nevertheless, the detailed root cause is still under discussion. Latest results show that a similar degradation occurs by annealing lifetime samples in the dark without carrier injection. In this work, we show that mc-Si PERC cells degrade and recover at high temperature without carrier injection. As the lateral appearance and the recovery behaviour agree with what is known about LeTID, it is likely that the same defect is observed. However, even after recovery the treatment in the dark does not result in LeTID stable cells. A subsequent illumination leads to a further power loss. This subsequent degradation differs from the first degradation in its kinetics and its lateral appearance. Based on these results it is concluded that two recombination active defect states are activated by LeTID. These recombination active defect states can be distinguished by annealing the samples without carrier injection before illuminating the samples. However, a high temperature anneal activates also additional defects, which might lead to a more pronounced degradation. Thus, a high temperature treatment is not recommended for LeTID testing neither as substitution nor as pretreatment prior the LeTID test.

Abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication of sepsis that often leads to fatal lung disease without effective therapies. It is known that bone marrow derived macrophages are important in resolving the inflammation and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Here, we hypothesize that treatment in combination of DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) 5-Aza 2-deoxycytidine (Aza) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Trichostatin A (TSA) mitigates the inflammation induced pyroptosis and apoptosis during endotoxemia induced ALI. To test this hypothesis, the mice challenged with a sublethal dose of LPS followed by one-hour post-treatment with a single dose of Aza and TSA intraperitoneally showed a substantial attenuation of apoptosis and inflammation. Importantly, we observed significant changes in the mitochondrial membrane structure, and lower levels of DNA fragmentation, reduced expression of apoptotic and pyroptotic genes both transcriptionally and translationally in LPS induced BMDMs treated by a combination of Aza and TSA than in LPS-induced BMDMs treated with either drug alone. The protection was mediated by an inhibition of JNK-ERK and STAT3-JMJD3 activated pathways. Thus, targeting these important signaling pathways with the combination of Aza and TSA would be a good treatment modality for ALI.

Abstract: In present work, we synthesized ZnFe2O4 nanorods on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate using spray coating method followed by two-step high-temperature quenching (HTQ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that Sn4+ is diffused from the FTO substrate after the second quenching, which could help in minimizing the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Photoelectrochemical measurements of the ZnFe2O4 nanorod photoelectrodes quenched at 780 °C, 800 °C, and 820 °C indicate that among the studied samples (ZFO1, ZFO2 and ZFO3), the highest photocurrent density was observed for nanotextured ZFO3 photoelectrodes (130 µA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs RHE). The photoelectrochemical performances of the ZnFe2O4 nanorods after the second quenching were compared with those of the firstly quenched ZnFe2O4 nanorod samples; water-oxidation photocurrent density of the former (ZFO3) was increased by 6.9 times compared with that of the first quenching (PZFO). Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and photoluminescence (PL) results confirm the faster charge extraction was achieved for the ZFO3 photoelectrode. Thus, the overall photocurrent density during the second quenching process results from the effectively improved crystallinity, the reduced strain and suppressed charge–carrier recombination's on both the surface as well as in the bulk of the ZnFe2O4 nanorods. In terms of solar water splitting, these research findings provide an effective route for the synthesis of other nanostructures.

Abstract: To enhance energy absorption of photovoltaics, several etching experiments with various parameters were performed. In addition, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) simulation was utilized to predict chemical nano etching parameters such as masking and etching durations for Silicon (Si) solar cell applications to reach minimum surface reflectance in an optimum etching duration. Experiments were performed with different masking and etching durations to determine the characteristics of surface reflectance of micro textured n-type single crystalline Si wafers in 25mmx25mm width and 300 µm thickness to provide training data for ANN. For this purpose, solutions with identic properties including Ag nanoparticles were applied with different application durations on the surfaces of n-type single crystalline Si wafers to cover partially the Si surfaces with Ag nano-particles at masking step. After, partially masked Si surfaces were exposed to chemical nano etching to develop nano-sized porous structures under different etching durations in an identic acidic etching solution. For the etching of Si wafers, 32 masking and etching processes were performed. Reflectance measurements and SEM images were evaluated to determine the optimum etching duration resulting the best surface quality with minimum reflectance. In addition, reflectance values were utilized as input data for training, testing and validation steps of developed ANN. In the ANN simulation, 70% of reflectance values were used as training, 15% of reflectance values were used as validation and 15% of reflectance values were used to test data in the ANN. Consequently, surface reflectance values under different masking and etching durations were predicted with the new parameter set by using the trained ANN with a success level above 99%.

Abstract: Type I Gaucher Disease (GD1) is known to be associated with hypocholesterolemia and reduced levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL). In this study we aimed to correlate disease severity with HDL levels and to evaluate the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on HDL levels as well as estimating the frequency of cardiovascular events in GD. Two groups of GD1 patients were evaluated: 30 untreated and 36 patients on ERT. Disease severity, biomarkers of GD and lipid levels were evaluated in the two groups. The Zimran Severity Score Index (SSI) was used to estimate disease severity and the effect of ERT on HDL levels was evaluated, as well as the frequency of cardiovascular disease. GD1 patients with more severe disease (SSI median 11) had significantly lower levels of HDL (median 23mg/dL), compared to patients with milder (SSI median 4.5) disease (median 37mg/dL p=0.001). HDL levels increased after ERT. Despite lower HDL levels in patients with more severe disease, a low frequency of cardiovascular events was detected. HDL level should be used in GD as a biomarker for diagnosis, monitoring and estimation of ERT effect.

Abstract: Using molten salts as thermal energy storage materials in concentrated solar power system plays a key role in recent research. Increasing specific heat capacity of molten salts can enhance their thermal storage capacity. In this paper, the effect of nanoparticles on specific heat capacity of NaNO3-KNO3 is studied. Modified salts were synthesized by using sol-gel combustion method based on the combustion of sol or gel of Mg(NO3)2 and citric acid or urea in NaNO3-KNO3. Chemical and phase composition of modified salts were detected based on the results of X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Microstructure of nanoparticles and molten salt was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM). The results show that nanoparticles are successfully prepared. MgO nanoparticles possess dendritic structure with a length of tens to hundreds of nanometers and a width of 2–5 nm in the citric acid system, and MgO nanoparticles show spherical structure with the diameter about 5 nm in the urea system. According to the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results, the specific heat capacity of modified salts increases to varying degrees, while the latent heat changes little. In citric acid system, the solid specific heat capacity increases by 93.1%, while the liquid specific heat capacity increases by 83.9%. In urea system, the solid specific heat capacity increases by 86.7%, while the liquid specific heat capacity increases by 59.9%. Thermal conductivity of modified salts in urea system is higher than that of solar salt, but much lower than that in citric acid system.

Abstract: Jak-Stat pathway is the first pathway identified to stimulate spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) self-renewal and maintenance activity. Recent studies have showed that stat3 a crucial gene implicated in this pathway can regulate self-renewal in male germline stem cell. In our previous study, we demonstrated that miR-19b-3p induces cell proliferation and reduces heterochromatin through Plzf which also regulates the balance between cell self-renewal and differentiation. Because miRNA can target several genes and to understand more about Plzf, a crucial transcription factor of SSCs, we performed microarray and found that miR-19b-3p integrate Jak-Stat through Plzf to regulate cell self-renewal. Our results demonstrated that miR-19b-3p induces Jak-Stat when Plzf is downregulated; overexpression of Plzf reversed the trend and shown an existence of feedback (-/+) between Plzf and GHR. The cell self-renewal markers CD49f, GFRα1, Oct4 and cKIT analyzed in the both groups miR-19b-3p and Plzf-overexpressing compared to their respective control confirm miR-19b-3p regulates cell pluripotency and self-renewal in goat male germline stem cells through Plzf. Together our finding revels that miR-19b-3p control Jak-Stat signaling through Plzf.

Abstract: The stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is one of the major challenges to their commercialization. In this work, the stability of state-of-the-art mesoporous PSCs employing multi-cation mixed-halide perovskite and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as the hole-transport-layer (HTL) is studied under illumination at an elevated temperature in N2 environment. The Rb in the quadruple-cation perovskite is found to segregate when the film undergoes aging under simultaneous light and heat exposure. More importantly, the PTAA layer prevents diffusion of gold into the perovskite layer when aged at 85 °C in the dark, but not under light. As a result, the PSCs thermally aged under light degrade much more severely than cells thermally aged in the dark. Therefore, the term Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID) is introduced for PSCs. The effect is also evident for PCSs employing a copper(II) 2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butyl-29H,31H-phthalocyanine (CuPC) HTL. This effect seriously impacts the operational stability of PSCs and it might not be detected with the current stress tests defined in the IEC-61646 standard. PSCs with a transparent contact and robust perovskite composition are developed with improved stability against LeTID. The cells retain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after > 160 h operating under illumination at 85 °C in N2 environment.

Abstract: Chemotherapeutic agents are commonly used as neoadjuvant for breast cancer therapy. However, there is evidence of treatment failure for most of patients due to acquired resistance. Cancer stem cells, a small population of cells within tumors, contribute to cancer resistance, tumor relapse, and metastasis. Therefore breast cancer stem cells-targeted therapy is a strategic way of overcoming chemoresistance. Some natural products have been identified to target breast cancer stem cells. This article aims to discuss the current report of preclinical studies of natural products i.e., phytochemicals, compound isolated from mushroom and alkaloid from the sponge that target breast cancer stem cells. This review does not only describe biological effects of natural products i.e., its effect on the signaling pathway, but also discuss chemical structure modification as well as recent pharmaceutical technology of natural products to target breast cancer stem cells. In conclusion, those natural products posses as novel therapeutic agents for breast cancer stem cells eradication and lead compound for the development of breast cancer stem cells-targeted drug.

Abstract: Objective
This study aimed at finding the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), miRNA and mRNA which played critical roles in breast cancer (BrCa) by using mixOmics R package.
Method
The BrCa dataset were obtained from TCGA and then analyzed using "DESeq2" R package. Multivariate analyses were performed with the "mixOmics" R package and the first component of the stacked partial least-Squares discriminant analysis results were used for searching the interested lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA. qRT-PCR was applied to identify the bioinformatics results in four BrCa cell lines (MCF7, BT-20, ZR-75-1, and MX-1) and the breast epithelial cell line MCF-10 A. Then cells (MCF-1 and MX-1) were transfected with si-linc01561, miR-145-5p mimics and si-MMP11 to further investigate the effects of linc01561, miR-145-5p and MMP11 on the BrCa cells proliferation and apoptosis.
Results
MixOmics results showed that linc01561, miR-145-5p and MMP11 might play important roles in BrCa. qRT-PCR results identified that in BrCa cell lines, linc01561 and MMP11 were higher expressed while miR-145-5p was lower expressed compared with those in epithelial cell line. The linc01561 inhibition elevated miR-145-5p expression and then suppressed MMP11 expression. Moreover, linc01561 inhibition suppressed the BrCa cells proliferation and promoted the apoptosis, which was realized by up-regulating expression of miR-145-5p and down-regulating expression of MMP11.
Conclusion
In summary, the findings of this study, based on ceRNA theory, combining the research foundation of miR-145-5p and MMP11, and taking linc01561 as a new study point, provide new insight into molecular-level reversing proliferation and apoptosis of BrCa.

Abstract: Dysfunction of HSF4 is associated with congenital cataracts. HSF4 transcription activity is turned on and regulated by phosphorylation during early postnatal lens development. Our previous data suggested that mutation HSF4b/S299A can upregulate HSF4 transcription activity in vitro, but the biological significance of posttranslational modification on HSF4/S299 during lens development remains unclear. Here, we found that the mutation HSF4/S299A can upregulate the expression of HSP25 and alpha B-crystallin at both protein and mRNA levels in mouse the lens epithelial cell line, but HSF4/S299D does not. Using the rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-S299 of HSF4, we found that EGF and ectopic expression of MEK1 can increase the phosphorylation of HSF4/S299 and induce HSF4 sumoylation, and these effects are inhibited by U0126. ERK1/2 can phosphorylate the S299 in HSF4/wt but not in HSF4/S299A in the in vitro kinase assay. Functionally, ectopic MEK1 can inhibit HSF4-controled alpha B-crystallin expression but has less effect on HSF4/S299A. EGF can upregulate phospho-HSF4/S299 and downregulate alpha B-crystallin expression in P3 mouse lens, and this downregulation is suppressed by U0126. During mouse lens development, phosphorylation of HSF4/S299 is downregulated in P3 lens and upregulated in P7 and P14 lens. However, in 2 months old lens, both phosphorylation of HSF4/S299 and total HSF4 protein are decreased. Interestingly, ERK1/2 activity is lower in P3 lens than in P7 and P14 lens, which is in line with the phosphorylation of HSF4/S299. Taken together, our data demonstrate that HSF4/299 is a phosphorylation target of MEK1-ERK1/2, and phosphorylation of S299 is responsible for tuning down HSF4 transcription activity during postnatal lens development.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the mechanisms for corrosion and delamination observed in Si photovoltaic modules subjected to high temperature and humidity with a negative-ground bias testing. Based on the thermodynamic data, the ionic component of the leakage current causes reduction reactions of water on the cathodic metallization, producing hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions. Ag fingers are strong catalysts for this reduction reaction compared to other materials used in solar cells and can be the initiation sites of corrosion and delamination caused by the electrochemical reactions. The produced hydrogen gas accumulates inside the module potentially producing a high gas pressure that can promote delamination, which is often preferentially initiated on metallization where the adhesion strength is lower [1], [2], [3]. The local basicity near the metal surface increases due to the hydroxide ion generation. Thus, the environment inside the encapsulant can be alkaline despite the presence of acetic acid decomposition products from the encapsulant. Corrosion of materials such as Si used in solar cells occurs and the extent depends on their corrosion resistance to the alkaline solution. This suggests that corrosion and delamination are interactive and promote the formation and propagation of one another.

Abstract: CsPbBr3 nanoparticles uniformly distributed on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form CsPbBr3/rGO nanocomposites are synthesized by a facile method. Their corresponding optical and X-ray photon response are investigated. UV–visible absorption spectra and photoluminescence measurements confirm that loading CsPbBr3 nanoparticles with an even distribution onto rGO surface can enhance the absorption and photon-generated carrier transportation. Thus, a significant enhancement in optical and X-ray photon response is demonstrated in CsPbBr3/rGO nanocomposites as compared with pure CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. Clear conductive switching phenomenon with a state conversion between “on” and “off” is also observed under the intermittent x-ray exposure. These results may provide a new potential application of CsPbBr3/rGO nanocomposites for X-ray photon detection.

Abstract: We have previously reported that the phototoxic action of the lipophilic phthalocyanine Pc9 (2,9(10),16(17),23(24) tetrakis[(2-dimethylamino)ethylsulfanyl]phthalocyaninatozinc(II)) encapsulated into poloxamine micelles is related to the induction of an apoptotic response in murine colon CT26 carcinoma cells. In the present study, we explored the intracellular signals contributing to the resulting apoptotic death. We found that Pc9-T1107 arrests cell cycle progression immediately after irradiation promoting then an apoptotic response. Thus, 3 h after irradiation the percentage of hypodiploid cells increased from 5.9 ± 0.6% to 23.1 ± 0.1%; activation of caspases 8 and 9 was evident; the population of cells with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential increased from 1.1 ± 0.4% to 44.0 ± 9.3%; the full-length forms of Bid and PARP-1 were cleaved; and a 50% decrease of the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL was detected. We also found that the photosensitizer, mainly retained in lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), promotes the permeabilization of lysosomal membranes and induces ER stress. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization was demonstrated by the reduction of acridine orange lysosome fluorescence, the release of Cathepsin D into the cytosol and ∼50% decrease of Hsp70, a chaperone recognized as a lysosomal stabilizer. Cathepsin D also contributed to Bid cleavage and caspase 8 activation. The oxidative damage to the ER induced an unfolded protein response characterized, 3 h after irradiation, by a 3-fold increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels and 3–4 times higher expression of ER chaperones GRP78/BIP, calnexin, Hsp90 and Hsp110. The cell death signaling promoted by cytosolic Ca2+, calpains and lysosomal proteases was partially abolished by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, the calpain inhibitor PD 150606 and proteases inhibitors. Furthermore, Bax down-regulation observed in Pc9-treated cells was undetectable in the presence of PD 150606, indicating that calpains contribute to Bax proteolytic damage. In summary, our results indicate that photoactivation of Pc9-T1107 led to lysosomal membrane permeabilization, induction of ER stress and activation of a caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.

Abstract: Photoreflectance spectroscopy is used to study optical properties of GaNPAs for the intermediate band (IB) solar cell absorbers. The IB is created in GaNPAs by the incorporation of ~2% of N atoms and the required partial occupation of the intermediate band with electrons is realized by doping with Si donors. Undoped and p-type doped (Be doped) GaNPAs films are studied as a references. Observation of all three absorption bands: VB → IB (a transition between the valence band and the IB), VB → CB (a transition between the valence band and the conduction band), and IB → CB (a transition between the IB and the conduction band), demonstrate that n-type doped GaNPAs layers act as intermediate band solar cell absorbers.

Abstract: Carbon nanomaterials decorated phase change material emulsions (PCMEs) are promising working fluids for direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs). Aiming at realizing an optimization, eleven PCMEs with different mass fractions of graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) (0.04%, 0.055%, 0.07%, 0.085% and 0.10%) and paraffin (15%, 20% and 25%) were prepared, and their thermophysical characteristics, optical absorption properties, and photo-thermal conversion performance were investigated systematically. It is shown that the thermal conductivity and optical absorption of the GNPs decorated PCMEs increase with the mass fraction of the GNPs, but show a reverse trend as the mass fraction of the paraffin is increased. The viscosity increases with the increase of the paraffin mass fraction at the same temperature, and gradually decreases along with the temperature increases. The photo-thermal conversion performance of the 0.04% GNPs decorated PCMEs is inferior to that of the ones at higher loadings of the GNPs; while, at high loadings of the GNPs, an interaction between the effect of the GNPs and that of the paraffin should be considered. It is revealed that thermal conductivity is an important factor influencing the temperature distributions within the PCMEs. And to avoid the evaporation of the water included in a PCME to weaken the incident light consequently, its optical absorption property should match with its thermal conductivity. The 0.07% GNPs decorated 20% PCME possesses the best photo-thermal conversion performance, and the relative heat storage capacity is 1.64 times as higher as that of distilled water. The 100 heating-cooling cycles test indicates that the 0.07% GNPs decorated 20% PCME exhibits good thermal reliability, making it show great potentials for use in DASCs.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are non-coding RNA which functions as regulators of genes expression. MicroRNAs have shown their biological functions in cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell metabolism, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis. Cancer cells have the ability to grow in the absence of growth factors by increased metabolic activity. MicroRNAs regulate cell metabolic processes by targeting the key enzymes or transporters and change the metabolic activities by interfering with oncogenes/tumor suppressors, hypoxia, signalling pathways and cell adhesion. This review mainly explains the roles of microRNAs in prostate cancer cell metabolism, such as glucose uptake, glycolysis and lactate secretion, lipid metabolism and interaction with signalling pathways. The relation of microRNAs with hypoxia and cell adhesion in cell metabolism is also highlighted. Therefore, miRNAs help in regulating the metabolism of survived tumor cells, understanding such miRNA-mediated interaction could lead to new avenues in therapeutic application to treat PCa.

Abstract: Almost any anatomical compartment may be involved in Gaucher disease (GD). Abdominal lymphadenopathy occurred during enzyme replacement therapy in more than a dozen children with GD so far. A fourteen-year-old boy from Serbia developed clinical signs of acute appendicitis six years after the onset of GD type 3 related abdominal lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound examination showed diffuse thickening of the intestinal wall in the ileocoecal region with periappendicular infiltration. An appendectomy was performed four months after conservative treatment with antibiotics. Histopathology revealed macrophages with cytological characteristics of Gaucher cells densely crammed in mesoappendiceal adipose tissue. Also the multifocal replacement of subserosal tissue by Gaucher cells and their infiltration to a variable depth of muscularis propria of the appendix were verified. Frank infiltration of the vermiform appendix with Gaucher cells represents a novel observation in a wide spectrum of manifestations reported in GD. A possible causative relationship of this infiltration with appendicitis is considered.

Abstract: Gaucher Disease type 1 (GD1) is a lysosomal disorder that affects many systems. Therapy improves the principal manifestations of the condition and, as a consequence, many patients show a modified phenotype which reflects manifestations of their disease that are refractory to treatment. More generally, it is increasingly recognised that information as to how a patient feels and functions [obtained by patient- reported outcome measurements (PROMs)] is critical to any comprehensive evaluation of treatment. A new set of management goals for GD1 in which both trends are reflected is needed. To this end, a modified Delphi procedure among 25 experts was performed. Based on a literature review and with input from patients, 65 potential goals were formulated as statements. Consensus was considered to be reached when ≥75% of the participants agreed to include that specific statement in the management goals. There was agreement on 42 statements. In addition to the traditional goals concerning haematological, visceral and bone manifestations, improvement in quality of life, fatigue and social participation, as well as early detection of long-term complications or associated diseases were included. When applying this set of goals in medical practice, the clinical status of the individual patient should be taken into account.

Abstract: Female sex steroid hormones have a fundamental role in breast cancer. Meanwhile, current evidence supports the contribution of breast cancer stem cells in carcinogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the interaction between breast cancer stem cells with sex hormones or key hormonal antagonists remains elusive.
Objective
To investigate the effect of diverse sex hormonal stimulation and suppression regimens on the proliferation of a primary human breast cancer cells with stem cell activity.
Methods
Cells were exposed to estradiol, progesterone, letrozole, ulipristal acetate, or a combination of ulipristal acetate-letrozole, continually for 6 months. Additionally, nanoparticle-linked letrozole and ulipristal acetate formulations were included in a subsequent short-term exposure study. Phenotypic, pathologic, and functional characteristics of unexposed cells were investigated.
Results
The proliferation of breast cancer cells was comparable among all hormonal stimulation and suppression groups (P = 0.8). In addition, the nanoparticle encapsulated hormonal antagonists were not able to overcome the observed resistance of cells. Cell characterization showed a mesenchymal-like phenotype overexpressing three master pluripotency markers (Oct 4, SOX2, and Nanog), and 92% of cells were expressing ALDH1A1. Notably, the CD44 high/CD24 low cell population presented only 0.97%–5.4% over repeat analyses. Most cells lacked the expression of mesenchymal markers; however, they showed differentiation into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Upon transfer to serum-free culture, the long-term maintained mesenchymal-like cancer cells showed remarkable morphologic plasticity as they switched promptly into an epithelial-like phenotype with significant mammosphere formation capacity (P = 0.008).
Conclusion
Breast cancer cells can develop a pluripotent program with enhanced stemness activity that may together contribute to universal resistance to sex hormonal stimulation or deprivation. Isolation and characterization of patient-derived breast cancer stem cells in large clinical studies is therefore crucial to identify new targets for endocrine therapies, potentially directed towards stemness and pluripotency markers. Such direction may help overcoming endocrine resistance and draw attention to breast cancer stem cells’ behaviour under endogenous and exogenous sex hormones throughout a woman’s reproductive life.

Abstract: In the spleens of Gaucher disease mice and patients, there is a striking elevation of expression of glycoprotein non-Metastatic Melanoma B (gpNMB). We conducted a study in a large cohort of patients with Gaucher disease to assess the utility of serum levels of soluble fragment of gpNMB as a biomarker of disease activity. There was >15-fold elevation of gpNMB in sera of untreated patients with Gaucher disease. gpNMB levels correlated with overall disease severity as well as the severity of individual organ compartments: liver, spleen, bone and hematological disease. Imiglucerase enzyme replacement therapy resulted in significant reduction of gpNMB. Serum levels of gpNMB were highly correlated with accumulation of bioactive lipid substrate of Gaucher disease, glucosylsphingosine as well as established biomarkers, chitotriosidase and chemokine, CCL18. Our results suggest utility of gpNMB as a biomarker of Gaucher disease to monitor individual patients and cohorts of patients for disease progression or response to therapy. Investigation of gpNMB in Gaucher disease pathophysiology is likely to illuminate our understanding disease mechanisms.

Abstract: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most difficult malignancy to treat due to a lack of targeted therapy. Studies have demonstrated that the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was preferentially found in TNBC. Frizzled-7 (Fzd7), one of the Wnt receptors, was significantly up-regulated in TNBC and modulated TNBC tumorigenesis through the Wnt signaling pathway, indicating Fzd7 is a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC. Here, we designed a recombinant soluble peptide fragment (rhFzd7) to antagonize Fzd7 by competitively binding with Wnt ligands. We demonstrated the ability of rhFzd7 to bind to its ligand, Wnt3a, and monitored the kinetic process using a Biacore X100 system. In addition, the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity of rhFzd7 were studied in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that the purified rhFzd7 pulled down Wnt3a from MDA-MB-231 cells and exhibited high affinity with Wnt3a (KD: 3.41 × 10−8 M). The data in vitro revealed that rhFzd7 inhibited proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells, and induced apoptosis of TNBC cells effectively. The anti-angiogenic assay indicated that rhFzd7 repressed TNBC angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the study in vivo showed that rhFzd7 could sensitize TNBC cells to the anti-tumor effect of Docetaxel. In conclusion, the generation of rhFzd7 lays foundation for the screening of anti-Fzd7 antibody, and this novel design provides an effective candidate for the clinical treatment of TNBC.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD), the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is characterized by systemic accumulation of macrophages engorged with glycosphingolipid-laden lysosomes. Even though both lysosomes and sphingolipids play a pivotal role in metabolic homeostasis, little is known on metabolic abnormalities associated with GD. In this review, we discuss the peculiarity of energy balance and glucose and lipid metabolism in adult type 1 GD patients. Moreover, we evaluate the potential relationship between these metabolic derangements, cardiovascular risk and chronic liver disease. The limited data available show that adult type 1 GD is characterized by a hypermetabolic state, peripheral insulin resistance and hypolipidemia with markedly reduced HDL-cholesterol levels, partially reverted by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Although this unfavorable metabolic profile has not been associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes and premature atherosclerosis, a natural history study has shown that cardio-cerebrovascular events and malignancy are the leading causes of death in treated type 1 GD patients. Hepatomegaly is frequently observed in GD and ERT/SRT are highly effective in reducing liver volume. Nevertheless, patients with GD may be at increased risk of long-term liver complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The role that ERT/SRT and/or lifestyle habits may have on such metabolic features of GD patients, and subsequently on long-term prognosis, deserves further investigations. To gain more insights into the peculiarity of GD metabolism may serve both surveillance and treatment purposes by helping to identify new markers of disease severity and define an updated natural history of GD.

Abstract: Alternative splicing is a regulatory mechanism by which multiple mRNA isoforms are generated from single genes. Numerous genes that encode membrane trafficking proteins are alternatively spliced. However, there is limited information about the functional consequences that result from these splicing transitions. Here, we developed appropriate tools to study the functional impact of alternative splicing in development within the most in vivo context. Secondly, we provided evidence of the physiological implications of splicing regulation during muscle development. Our previous work in mouse heart development identified three trafficking genes that are regulated by alternative splicing between birth and adulthood: the clathrin heavy chain, the clathrin light chain-a, and the trafficking kinesin binding protein-1. Here, we demonstrated that alternative splicing regulation of these three genes is tissue- and developmental stage-specific. To identify the functional consequences of splicing regulation in vivo, we used genome editing to block the neonatal-to-adult splicing transitions. We characterized the phenotype of one of these mouse lines and demonstrated that when splicing regulation of the clathrin heavy chain gene is prevented mice exhibit an increase in body and muscle weights which is due to an enlargement in myofiber size. The significance of this work has two components. First, we revealed novel roles of the clathrin heavy chain in muscle growth and showed that its regulation by alternative splicing contributes to muscle development. Second, the new mouse lines will provide a useful tool to study how splicing regulation of three trafficking genes affects tissue identity acquisition and maturation in vivo.

Abstract: A novel composite phase change material (PCM) used as exterior and interior envelop materials for passive solar energy utilization was synthesized and investigated in this paper. Eutectic hydrated salt (EHS) consisted sodium carbonate decahydrate (SCD) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DHPD) with a mass ratio of 5:5 was prepared as the PCM with its phase change temperature of 26.94 °C and phase change enthalpy of 198.44 J/g while three different kinds of expanded perlites (EPs) were pretreated as supporting materials. According to the results of leakage tests and volume enthalpy, 70%EHS/EP2 was chosen as the form-stable phase change materials (FSPCM) to fabricate phase change insulation panels. The thermal conductivity with different temperature of 70%EHS/EP2 was measured and the maximum was 0.44 W/(m K) when the testing temperature was 25 °C. In addition, the heat storage and release results of 70%EHS/EP2 indicated that there was no supercooling. The thermogravimetric analysis and thermal cycling tests were performed and the results indicated that 70%EHS/EP2 had a good thermal stability and reliability. The heat transfer properties of EP panel and 70%EHS/EP2 phase change panel were tested and the results showed 70%EHS/EP2 phase change panel could remarkably decrease the maximum temperature during the melting process and obviously prolong the time of heat preservation in the cooling process which contributed to its good thermal control performance.

Abstract: Malaria remains a significant public health problem worldwide with an estimated annual global incidence of 200 million and an estimated 450,000 annual deaths. Among the five known human malarial species, Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest and most resistant to antimalarials. Hence, there is a need for new antimalarial targets. The rational design of a drug is usually based on biochemical and physiological differences between pathogens and their hosts. In view of their high rate of replication, parasites require very active nucleic acid synthesis which necessitates large supplies of the indispensable pyrimidine nucleotides. Consequently, delineation of P. falciparum pyrimidine metabolic pathways may reveal potential targets for the chemotherapy of malaria. Previous studies reported the existence of pyrimidine de novo pathways in this organism. The present results demonstrate the presence of enzymes of the pyrimidine salvage pathways in P. falciparum and indicate that this parasite is capable of pyrimidine salvage. Furthermore, some of the pyrimidine salvage enzymes, e.g., dTMP kinase, phosphoribosyltransferase, and uridine phosphorylase could be excellent targets for chemotherapeutic intervention against this parasite.

Abstract: Amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor2 (FGFR2) has been regarded as a druggable target in gastric cancer (GC). Despite known potential of AZD4547, a selective inhibitor of FGFR 1–3, to suppress tumorigenic effects of activated FGFR2, resistance to the targeted agent has been an unresolved issue. This study was performed to elucidate the mechanism of AZD4547 resistance in GC cells. SNU-16 cells were used to establish an AZD4547-resistant GC cell line, SNU-16R. Elevated phosphorylation of EphB3 was confirmed using the Human Phospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Array kit. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of EphB3 was used to investigate the effects of suppressed EphB3 activity in the SNU-16R cell line. SNU-16R cells exhibited upregulated phosphorylation of EphB3. Treatment of SNU-16R cells with the EphB3 TKI resulted in induction of apoptosis, decreased cellular viability, and cell cycle arrest at sub-G1 phase. SNU-16R cells expressed upregulated levels of N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9, and reduced levels of E-cadherin, characteristic of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Matrigel invasion assay also demonstrated the increased invasiveness of SNU-16R cells. EphB3 TKI treatment inhibited EMT of SNU-16R cells. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway was suggested as the signal transduction mechanism downstream EphB3 by showing enhanced phosphorylation of Raf-1, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, mTOR and its downstream substrates in SNU-16R cells. As expected, EphB3 TKI decreased phosphorylation of these proteins. Our data suggest phosphorylation of mTOR through signaling by EphB3 is a potential mechanism of AZD4547 resistance in GC cells.

Abstract: We report a high efficiency antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) photovoltaic device structure using a new multi-step close space sublimation deposition process incorporating a Sb2Se3 seed layer; key to achieving higher efficiency devices via close space sublimation. Utilizing a glass|FTO|TiO2|Sb2Se3|PCDTBT|Au structure, a peak efficiency of 6.6% was achieved, which is comparable to the current record devices for this material. Crucially, this device avoids toxic lead in the hole transport material, and cadmium in the window layer. Moreover, the addition of the PCDTBT back contact both maintains peak efficiency of 6.6%, and improves the uniformity of performance, increasing the average efficiency from 4.3% to 6.1%.

Abstract: In this paper n-type PERT (Passivated Emitter and Rear Totally diffused) silicon wafer solar cells with a diffused boron rear emitter and an implanted phosphorus front surface field are investigated. A key feature of the n-PERT rear emitter cell is that it uses the same sequence of surface passivation, rear local laser ablation and screen-printing processes as a commercial p-type PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact) cell. Therefore, this cell structure is very industrially relevant as it could simplify a production line upgrade from p-type cells to n-type cells. Additionally, ion implantation provides an elegant single-side doping process that further simplifies the processing sequence of n-PERT cells. Ion implantation also provides excellent control over the doping profile via a variation of post-implant annealing time. The effect of annealing time on the implanted phosphorus surface was evaluated in this study in terms of the front surface field dopant profile and its impact on the solar cells’ electrical characteristics. A shallower front surface doping profile resulted in better short wavelength response. Additionally, the performance of two different Al pastes (with and without Si content in the paste) was compared. The better-performing Al-Si paste generates a homogeneous Al-p+ region under the contacts, which reduces the recombination at the contacts. By tailoring the phosphorus front surface field profiles and by minimising the recombination during the rear Al contact formation, efficiencies of up to 21% on large area 244 cm2 n-type wafers were achieved so far.

Abstract: Development of novel solar-based energy storage technologies are considered to be one of the primary solutions to fulfill the energy demand. Sugar alcohol based phase change materials are gaining more attention as a storage medium in thermal energy storage applications. The current study focuses on the synthesis of D-Mannitol (DM) based capsules using the sol-gel technique. The main objective is to control the seepage of DM during phase transition and to increase the thermophysical properties of DM. The synthesis is carried out with pH ranging from 2.0 to 7.0. SEM images showed a well-defined morphology with the uniform spherical shape at pH between 2.6 and 3.0. FTIR spectrum showed the characteristic peaks of silica and DM which suggested the successful encapsulation of DM with silica shell from TEOS source. The average particle size of the microencapsulated DM (MEDM) varied in the range of 45–60 µm. MEDM is subjected to thermal cycling to study the change in heat transfer properties upon cycling. The thermal conductivity of MEDM is found to be 1.77 W/m K, an increase from 1.32 W/m K of DM. From DSC thermograms, the encapsulation ratio and efficiency were observed to be 89.60% and 85.02% respectively. DM exhibited a subcooling temperature of 44.21 °C which was reduced to 11 °C for MEDM. DM is found to degrade initially at a temperature of 276 °C whereas MEDM is found to be 302 °C. The charging and discharging characteristics showed that the time taken to complete one cycle by MEDM lowered compared to DM. The characteristic study of MEDM reveals that it can be used as potential PCM in solar thermal energy storage system.

Abstract: Gaucher disease is mainly caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid β-glucosidase. Gaucher disease caused by the deficiency of saposin C is rare. Here we report a patient mainly presenting with hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and anemia. EEG examination revealed increased theta waves. Gaucher cells identified in his bone marrow and the highly elevated plasma chitotriosidase activity and glucosylsphingosine supported a diagnosis of Gaucher disease. However, the leukocyte β-glucosidase activity was in a normal range. Sanger sequencing revealed a novel maternal exonic mutation c.1133C>G (p.Pro378Arg) in exon 10 of the PSAP gene, which codes the Sap C domain of PSAP protein. To search for other underlying mutations in this patient, whole genome sequencing was applied and revealed a deletion involving exon 2 to 7 of PSAP gene. The deletion appears as a de novo event on paternal chromosome. We concluded that biallelic mutations of PSAP gene were the cause of this patient's Gaucher disease. Our finding expands the mutation spectrum of Gaucher disease with saposin C deficiency.

Abstract: Structures or materials with both high reflectivity in ultraviolet-visible-near infrared region (UV–Vis–NIR) and high emissivity in middle infrared region (MIR) can achieve radiative cooling. In this paper, a new crystal Mg11(HPO3)8(OH)6 was synthesized by hydrothermal method. Measurement results show that this crystal presents a reflectivity of 88.04% in 0.2–2.5 µm region and an emissivity of 87.57% in 2.5–25 µm region, suggesting that this material could reflect most of the solar light radiation, and in addition dissipate heat to the surroundings and outer space. The cell parameters and structure simulation diagram were obtained from the result of the Rietveld refinement. The properties and mechanisms were discussed based on X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy and electron microscopy results. The cooling test under strong sunshine showed that the temperatures in space below Mg11(HPO3)8(OH)6 coating were 2–4 °C lower than those below the coatings based on commercial solar heat reflection materials as TiO2 and CaCO3, and 6–8 °C lower than that below Al-foil, suggesting the potential application of the new crystal in radiative cooling.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of the basicity parameter of glass frits added to the front contact of three-busbar Si solar cells on the removal of the anti-reflective coating (ARC) and the electrical characteristics of the cell. We investigated PbO-TeO2-SiO2 glass systems by adding oxides to improve the etching of the interface between the Ag electrode and the Si wafer. The thermal properties and viscous flows of the frits were characterized using differential thermal analysis and a hot-stage microscope. The microstructure of the glass layer at the interface of the Ag electrode and Si wafer was observed using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the electrical properties were dependent on the morphology of the interfacial structure. The addition of oxides to the glass system produced more recrystallites on the n+ emitter with a greater penetration depth in the Si wafer, thereby increasing the efficiency of the solar cell. The reactivity of the glass affected the removal of the ARC and the electrical properties of the Si solar cells were influenced by the charge transport facilitated by the Ag crystallites.

Abstract: Magnesium-doped Zinc Oxide (MZO) films have recently been proposed as a transparent buffer layer for thin film CdTe solar cells. In this study, the band gap of MZO buffer layers was tuned for CdTe solar cells by increasing the substrate temperature during deposition. Films were deposited by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. Devices incorporating an optimised MZO buffer layer deposited at 300 °C with a band gap of 3.70 eV yielded a mean efficiency of 12.5% and a highest efficiency of 13.3%. Transmission electron microscopy showed that MZO films are uniformly deposited on the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer surface. The favourable band alignment seems to positively counterbalance the low doping level of the MZO layer and its high lattice mismatch with CdTe. Titanium-doped indium oxide, tin-doped indium oxide and aluminium-doped zinc oxide TCOs were also used as alternatives to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), in combination with MZO films. The use of titanium-doped indium oxide and tin-doped indium oxide TCOs did not improve the device efficiency achieved compared with FTO, however using aluminium-doped zinc oxide coupled with a boro-aluminosilicate glass substrate the mean and highest efficiencies were further improved to 12.6% and 13.4% respectively.

Abstract: Despite the existence of several highly effective and well-characterized passivating materials for crystalline silicon surfaces, the topic of surface passivation and the investigation of new passivating materials remain of considerable interest for silicon photovoltaics research. However, the question of whether and under what circumstances a particular material will provide effective surface passivation remains difficult to answer. In this work, we provide an overview of recent insights relating to this question, drawing from our own work on novel passivation materials including MoOx, Nb2O5, TiOx, ZnO, and POx, and illustrated with experimental results. Factors that strongly influence the passivation performance include the use of pre-grown interfacial oxides, the film thickness, the annealing conditions, and the presence of capping layers. The impact of these factors on the surface passivation can vary widely from material to material. Therefore, all of these factors should be taken into account when investigating potential new surface passivation materials.

Abstract: This work experimentally investigated photothermal conversion behavior of Gold/water and MWCNT/water nanofluids at different volumetric concentrations (0.0001–0.004% and 0.0001–0.03%, respectively) in a direct absorption solar collector (DASC). The experiments were conducted for ~10 h outdoor on each test day, without interruptions. The results show that the tested nanofluids have excellent photothermal conversion capability even under very low concentrations. Specific absorption rate (SAR) presented an exponential decay with increasing volumetric concentration of nanoparticles in the sample while both the total energy stored by the fluid sample during the heating period and the stored energy ratio (SER) increased with the increase in nanoparticles concentration. The results indicate the existence of an “optimal” volumetric concentration, above which further nanoparticle addition becomes indifferent or infeasible. This optimal nanoparticle volumetric concentration was found to be 0.002% for the gold nanofluid and 0.001% for the MWCNT samples for the setup used in this work.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by the deficient activity of β-glucocerebrosidase due to pathogenic mutations in the GBA1. This gene has a pseudogene (GBAP) with 96% of sequence homology. Recombination (Rec) events in the GBA1 seem to be facilitated by an increased degree of homology and proximity to the GBAP. The objectives of this study were to validate the P338-X1 GBA kit (MRC-Holland) for Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) and to detect larger deletions/duplications present in GBA1 in GD patients from Brazil. Thirty-three unrelated Brazilian GD patients, previously genotyped by the Sanger method (both pathogenic alleles identified=29 patients, only one allele identified=3 patients, no pathogenic alleles identified=1 patient), were evaluated by the MLPA assay. MLPA was compatible with the previous results obtained by Sanger sequencing and identified an additional allele (a heterozygous deletion in intron 7 in one patient with only one mutation identified by Sanger). Our data suggest that, although larger deletions/duplications do not appear to be frequent in GD, the P338-X1 GBA kit for MLPA appears to be a good method for GBA1 analysis. Additional investigations should be performed in order to characterize the remaining four uncharacterized alleles of our sample.

Abstract: Design, preparation and characterization of a solar selective absorbing coating based on chromium oxynitride are reported in this contribution. All the layers were deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering in a horizontal in-line sputtering system. The optical constants of individual layers were obtained by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurement and fitting. The absorbing multilayer stack including, from substrate to air interface, Al infrared reflective layer/ (Cr/CrNx//CrNxOy) composite absorbing layer/ SiO2 antireflective layer were then designed and fabricated based on their optical properties and thickness optimization. This absorbing coating is characterized by the simple and stable reactive magnetron sputter coating process with no need for precise control of single layer thickness and reactive gas partial pressure. A solar absorptance more than 95% and thermal emissivity less than 4% for operation temperature of 100 °C were obtained by analyzing the measured spectra data. After aging test in air at 250 °C for 200 h, the performance criterion (PC) was below 1%, and the deterioration mechanism was further analyzed combined with XPS depth profile.

Abstract: Carrier selective junctions using a poly-silicon/ silicon oxide stack on crystalline silicon feature low recombination currents J0 whilst allowing for low contact resistivity ρC. We describe the limiting current transport mechanism as a combination of homogeneous tunneling through the interfacial silicon oxide layer and transport through pinholes where the interfacial silicon oxide layer is locally disrupted. We present an experimental method and its theoretical basis to discriminate between homogenous tunneling and local pinhole transport mechanisms on n + /n or p + /p junctions by measuring the temperature-dependent contact resistance. Theory predicts opposing trends for the temperature dependencies of tunneling and pinhole transport. This allows identifying the dominant transport path. For the contact resistance of two differently prepared poly-Si/ silicon oxide/ c-Si junctions we either find clear pinhole-type or clear tunneling-type temperature dependence. Pinhole transport contributes more than 94% to the total current for the sample with a 2.1 nm-thick interfacial silicon oxide that we anneal at a temperature of 1050 °C to achieve highest selectivity. In contrast pinhole transport contributes less than 35 % to the total current for the sample with a 1.7 nm-thick silicon oxide that we annealed at only 700 °C in order to avoid pinholes.

Abstract: Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which is characterized by increased proliferation, migration and invasion of endothelial cells, increased expression of mesenchymal markers and reduced expression of endothelial markers, has been reported to be closely related to the pathogenesis of several diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. Resistin-like molecule-β (RELM-β), also known as "found in inflammatory zone 2″ (FIIZ2), plays an essential role in airway remodeling and pulmonary fibrosis; however, its role and mechanism in EndMT remain unclear. Herein, we used TGF-β1-induced EndMT cell model in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human primary pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) to investigate the function and mechanism of RELM-β in TGF-β1-induced EndMT in endothelial cell lines. We found that TGF-β1 stimulation significantly upregulated RELM-β expression; RELM-β knockdown could attenuate TGF-β1-induced cell proliferation and migration of endothelial cell lines and changes in protein levels of EndMT markers. SB432542, an inhibitor of SMADs, could partially reverse TGF-β1-induced RELM-β expression, endothelial cell migration and changes in EndMT marker protein levels. SMADs complex exerted its effects through SMAD2/3/4 complex mediating RELM-β transcription. In conclusion, TGF-β1 induces RELM-β transcription to promote EndMT in HUVECs and HPAECs through activation of SMAD2/3/4; blocking SMADs-mediated RELM-β transcription might ameliorate TGF-β1-induced EndMT in endothelial cells.

Abstract: A spectrally selective Cr/AlCrN/AlCrNO/AlCrO multi-layer absorber coating has been designed and deposited on stainless steel substrates by the cathodic arc ion plating technique. The spectral properties of the multi-layer coating during the initial stage of thermal aging in air were investigated with the aim of achieving a basic understanding of its relation to microstructure. The composition, structure and surface morphology of the coatings were characterized using XRD, SEM, XPS, TEM and AFM, while the optical properties of the coatings were measured by spectrophotometers. The experimental results indicate that the multi-layer coating with a high solar absorptance of 0.90 and a relatively low emittance of 0.15 are obtained through parameter optimization. The structure analysis suggests that the as-deposited AlCrN and AlCrNO layers, acting as the main absorbers, are consisted of the AlN, Cr2N and AlN, CrN, Cr2N nanocrystallites embedding in amorphous matrix, respectively. While the AlCrO layer, acting as the anti-reflection layer, is consisted of mainly amorphous. After annealing at 500 °C for 2 h in air, a solar selectivity of 0.94/0.12 was achieved while the thermal emittance attained 0.25 at 500 °C. Based on the microstructural analysis, the enhancement in absorptance of the multi-layer AlCrNO-based coating during the initial stage of thermal aging could be attributed to the decomposition of Cr2N nanocrystallites and the recrystallization of the AlCrN and AlCrNO layers. While the enhanced emittance after annealing can be ascribed to the decomposition of the macro-droplets and the decrease of surface roughness. These results could provide new insights into rational use of the muti-layer coatings and spectral properties tuning of solar-selective functional multi-layer coatings and thus promote the development of coatings for photo-thermal conversion at high temperatures.

Abstract: The oxidative stress generation in bacteria by the presence of antibiotics (in this case silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)) is already widely known. Previously, we demonstrated that AgNPs generate oxidative stress in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli mediated by the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work we are demonstrating the consequences of the oxidative stress by the presence of AgNPs; these bacterial strains increased the levels of oxidized proteins and lipids. In addition, it was possible to determine which reactive oxygen species are mainly responsible for the oxidative damage to macromolecules. Also, we found that the bacterial DNA was fragmented and the membrane potential was modified. This increase in the levels of ROS found in both, S. aureus and E. coli, was associated with the oxidation of different types of important macromolecules for the normal functioning of cell, so the oxidative stress would be one of the mechanisms by which the AgNPs would exert their toxicity in both strains, one Gram positive and the other Gram negative of great clinical relevance.

Abstract: Silica multi-layer stacks have been designed with the aim to provide broadband antireflective (AR) properties for glass components in concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) application. Silica porous coatings were grown by combining acid-catalyzed sol-gel route and evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method with four types of organic/inorganic systems. Sols were prepared using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as inorganic precursor assembled with two di-block copolymers, one tri-block copolymer and one cationic surfactant as organic templates. Optical properties were characterized by ellipsometry and spectrophotometry while the material structure was analyzed by environmental ellipsometric porosimetry (EEP) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The concentration of inorganic and organic phases was optimized and a broadband AR bi-layer stack was obtained providing a 7.2% (under the reference AM1.5 solar spectral irradiance) increase in transmittance over bare glass in the wavelength range 300–2000 nm when coated on both sides.

Abstract: The HpGcr1, a hexose transporter homologue from the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula (Ogataea) polymorpha, was previously identified as being involved in glucose repression. Intriguingly, potential HpGcr1 orthologues are found only in the genomes of a few yeasts phylogenetically closely related to H. polymorpha, but are absent in all other yeasts. The other closest HpGcr1 homologues are fungal high-affinity glucose symporters or putative transceptors suggesting a possible HpGcr1 origin due to a specific archaic gene retention or via horizontal gene transfer from Eurotiales fungi. Herein we report that, similarly to other yeast non-transporting glucose sensors, the substitution of the conserved arginine residue converts HpGcr1R165K into a constitutively signaling form. Synthesis of HpGcr1R165K in gcr1Δ did not restore glucose transport or repression but instead profoundly impaired growth independent of carbon source used. Simultaneously, gcr1Δ was impaired in transcriptional induction of repressible peroxisomal alcohol oxidase and in growth on methanol. Overexpression of the functional transporter HpHxt1 in gcr1Δ partially restored growth on glucose and glucose repression but did not rescue impaired growth on methanol. Heterologous expression of HpGcr1 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae hxt-null strain did not restore glucose uptake due to protein mislocalization. However, HpGcr1 overexpression in H. polymorpha led to increased sensitivity to extracellular 2-deoxyglucose, suggesting HpGcr1 is a functional glucose carrier. The combined data suggest that HpGcr1 represents a novel type of yeast glucose transceptor functioning also in the absence of glucose.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) patients have an increased risk of cancer, in particular of hematological origin, while the association between GD and Neuroblastoma (NBL) has never been described. Here we report the case of an adolescent diagnosed with NBL, also presenting splenomegaly and persistent thrombocytopenia. The association with GD, suggested by the histological findings on bone marrow biopsy, was confirmed by enzymatic and genetic tests. The possible pathogenetic mechanisms are briefly reviewed. The evidence of this new association supports the necessity of further studies on GD comorbidities and the need of systematic data collection and analysis, potentially through an international registry. A greater attention for GD in the hemato-oncological field is needed, in order to avoid underdiagnosis and to optimize treatment strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of industrial-sized p-type passivated emitter and rear cells (PERCs) with a selective emitter (SE) structure. We focus on different assisted passivation schemes and use nitric acid oxidation of silicon (NAOS) to form an ultrathin SiO2 layer. The results show that all I–V parameters of the PERCs are significantly modified when SiO2 is present on the front and/or rear sides of the cell. For front-emitter passivation by NAOS-SiO2, we observe an increase in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) and strong enhancement of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for short-wavelength photons. This can be attributed to the high level of chemical passivation, as indicated by the reduced interface trap density (Dit), due to the reduced Shockley–Read–Hall recombination. By contrast, all I–V parameters associated with SiO2 rear passivation decrease due to the increased Dit, which results in enhanced surface recombination. The different types of surface passivation for n-type (front) and p-type (rear) surfaces are presumably due to different doping surface concentrations. These results suggest that NAOS surface pretreatment is a very promising technique to improve the level of surface passivation and thereby enhance the performance of industrial-sized PERCs.

Abstract: The red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is a common fruit worldwide and its extract has been found to inhibit the growth of many types of tumors, mainly because it is rich in bioactive phytochemicals. However, the mechanism underlying its anticancer activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. Herein, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of red raspberry phytochemicals on the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to elucidate its biochemical and molecular targets. CCK8 and colony formation, as well as flow cytometry assays, were employed to determine the effects of red raspberry extract (RRE) on cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution in HCC cells. Our results showed that RRE significantly inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle progression at the S phase in HCC cells. RRE increased the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) by reducing the methylation status of the PTEN gene promoter and inhibiting DNMT1 expression and regulated AKT signaling pathway. These findings show that red raspberry phytochemicals inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells by regulating PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, providing evidence that RRE may be used as a potential auxiliary therapy for patients with HCC.

Abstract: The perovskite/c-Si tandem technology is considered as a cost-effective approach to realize a cell efficiency beyond the limit of single-junction (SJ) c-Si cells. Compared to its counterpart of 2-terminal (2T) configuration, 4-terminal (4T) tandem has the advantages such as no constraint of current matching and potentially simple mechanical stacking. But one of the largest challenges is the limited near-infrared (NIR) transmission of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cell (ST-PSC), which has been a bottleneck to the c-Si bottom cell performance and eventually the whole tandem cell performance. The highest NIR transmittance that has been reported is about 84%. In this contribution, we demonstrate a p-i-n planar ST-PSC with an efficiency as high as 15.7% and with a record NIR transmittance of about 92%. It is realized by optimization of the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) material properties and light management. This NIR-transparent and high-efficiency ST-PSC leads to a 4T tandem cell efficiency of 25.7%, using an interdigitated-back-contact (IBC) c-Si bottom cell.

Abstract: The role of caspase-2 in cell death regulation remains largely unknown. In this study we have analyzed the involvement of caspase-2 in RIPK1-regulated necrosis (necroptosis) in human ovarian carcinoma cells. We show that these cells undergo necroptosis upon treatment with the DNA damaging drug cisplatin in combination with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. Downregulation of caspase-2 leads to an increase of necroptosis in CAOV-4 cells. Interestingly, an association of caspase-2 to the necrosome complex was not detected. Importantly, downregulation of caspase-2 with shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 system led to an enhanced phosphorylation of RIPK1 and MLKL. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that caspase-2 negatively regulates necroptotic cell death, which might play an important role in further therapeutic applications.

Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we review the developments which led to the present state-of-the-art in the surface passivation of today's industrially predominant dopant-diffused crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, based on dielectric layers such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide and stacks thereof. In the second part of this review, we focus on the future developments in the field of c-Si solar cells based on carrier-selective passivation layers. Whereas the dielectric layers are insulating and are hence applied only for passivating the non-contacted areas of the silicon surface, the carrier-selective passivation layers are intended to provide an effective passivation of non-contacted as well as contacted areas of a c-Si solar cell, thereby increasing the efficiency potential of c-Si solar cells significantly. Due to the fact that the carrier-selective layers are implemented in a contact, besides the good passivation properties for minorities, these layers must also provide a good majority carrier transport, i.e. they have to provide a low contact resistance. Both properties, i.e. suppression of minority-carrier recombination as well as good majority-carrier transport, define the selectivity of the carrier-selective contact, which is an important figure of merit for the assessment and comparison of different types of carrier-selective contacts. One very promising type of carrier-selective passivation layer is based on heavily doped polycrystalline silicon layers deposited on a thin silicon oxide layer, the latter providing the excellent passivation while enabling efficient majority-carrier transport via pin-holes and/or tunneling. Moreover, we discuss metal oxides and conductive polymers, which have only recently been applied to c-Si photovoltaics, but seem to have a promising potential as low-cost selective contact materials. We finally compare combinations of the various options of carrier-selective layers concerning their combined selectivities and efficiency potentials.

Abstract: The contamination of solar photovoltaic cover glass can significantly reduce the transmittance of light to the surface of the photovoltaic cell, reducing the module's power output. The solar industry has been developing antireflection (AR) and antisoiling (AS) surface coatings to enhance light transmittance and mitigate the impacts of soiling. Although uncoated glass has been field tested for decades, minimal data exist to demonstrate the durability of AR and AS coatings against abrasion and surface erosion, including from: natural weathering, airborne sand, and industry cleaning practices. Coupons 75 mm square of varying types have been field-deployed to gather long-term data on coating durability; the initial results are presented here after 1 year of outdoor exposure near Sacramento, California. Duplicate sets of coupons were cleaned monthly per four different cleaning practices. All coupons demonstrated inorganic soiling as well as microscale biological contamination, regardless of cleaning method. Additionally, full-sized, field-aged modules from other areas of the world presented with similar types of contamination as the field-aged coupons; micrographs and results from genomic sequencing of this contamination are included here. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy, surface roughness, transmittance, and surface energy analysis of representative specimens and cleaning practices are presented.

Abstract: This study presents a critical review of the major research and development work that has advanced surface solar absorption technology and also discusses the applications of this technology in the last 15 years. In a surface solar absorption collector (SSAC), solar radiation is first absorbed on the surface of the collector and then transferred to the circulating fluid. This article reviews a wide range of studies on different SSAC systems with the aim of identifying research gaps to prepare this technology for commercial availability. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative research information on non-concentrating and concentrating SSACs was collected and evaluated in the context of a performance-based assessment, environmental issues, and sustainability concerns. The performance of these collectors mainly relies on the receiver design and thermal storage tanks with different heat transfer fluids. For high concentration collectors, there is an urgent need for new heat transfer and storage fluids to withstand elevated temperatures to minimize the flow instability. A review of the literature suggests that ongoing high quality research on this technology, especially on medium and high concentration collectors, will soon overcome the existing problems bringing this technology into temperature ranges that will make it commercially available. Finally, the scientific challenges and opportunities relevant to this technology are also discussed.

Abstract: Gaucher disease is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by β-glucocerebrosidase deficiency and commonly treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The efficacy of ERT with velaglucerase alfa was assessed based on the achievement of published therapeutic goals and the normalization of disease parameters in 39 treatment-naïve patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, 6 to 62years of age, enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials. After 4years of ERT, therapeutic goals for thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly had been achieved in 100% of patients; goals for anemia and hepatomegaly had been achieved in 95% and 94% of patients, respectively. Consistent with the goal for bone mineral density, lumbar spine bone density improved in 87% of patients ≥18years of age. At year 4, compared with clinical ranges for healthy individuals, 86% of patients with a low baseline hemoglobin concentration had normalized, 60% with a low baseline platelet count had normalized, 67% with baseline splenomegaly had normalized, 58% with hepatomegaly had normalized, and lumbar spine bone density had normalized in 53% of adults. The decade-old therapeutic goals do not reflect the potential for normalization of clinical parameters in ERT-treated patients. Goals consistent with normalization or near-normalization should be considered. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00430625, NCT00553631, NCT00635427.

Abstract: Integrin-interacting protein Kindlin-2, as a focal adhesion protein, promotes growth and progression of breast cancer. However, the precise mechanism that underlie the role of Kindlin-2 in breast cancer is elusive. Here, we report that the expression of Kindlin-2 positively correlated with DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) in breast cancer patients. Further, we found that DNMT1 was upregulated in mammary gland tissues of mammary specific Kindlin-2 transgenic mice. More importantly, high expression of DNMT1 was observed in mammary tumors formed by Kindlin-2 transgenic mice. On the basis of these observations, DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-CdR was used and found its treatment strongly decreased Kindlin-2-induced breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, Kindlin-2 increased the stability of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 through interaction with DNMT1 and methylated CpG islands in the E-cadherin promoter. Kindlin-2 increased the occupancy of DNMT1 at E-cadherin promoter, thereby suppressing E-cadherin expression. Taken together, our data reveal that Kindlin-2 promotes breast cancer development by enhancing the stability of DNMT1.

Abstract: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental event characterized by phenotypic switching from a polarized epithelial phenotype to an unpolarized mesenchymal phenotype. Changes to plasma membrane function accompany EMT yet the differences in lipid composition of cells that have undergone EMT are relatively unexplored. To address this the lipidome of two cell models of EMT in breast epithelial tissue, D492 and HMLE, were analyzed by untargeted LC–MS. Detected masses were identified and their abundance was compared through multivariate statistical analysis. Considerable concordance was observed in eight lipid components between epithelial and mesenchymal cells in both cell models. Specifically, an increase in phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol were found to accompany EMT while phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens, as well as diacylglycerols decreased. The most abundant fatty acid lengths were C16 and C18 but mesenchymal cells had on average shorter and more unsaturated fatty acids. The results are consistent with enhanced cell mobility post EMT and reflect a consequence of oxidative stress pre- and post EMT in breast epithelial tissue.

Abstract: LncRNAs have been reported to maintain islet function and are associated with the development of diabetes. Here, we investigated Lincpint biological functions in mouse pancreatic β cells both in vivo and in vitro. We observed that Lincpint was highly expressed in BALB/c mouse islets and downregulated in db/db mouse islets by using qRT-PCR. Lincpint could be regulated by different concentrations of glucose in MIN6 cells. MTT and flow cytometry showed that silencing Lincpint expression in vitro increased cell apoptosis. In a GSIS assay, we detected that inhibition of the expression of Lincpint suppressed insulin synthesis and secretion. In male BALB/c mouse, blood glucose and serum insulin were decreased after knockdown of Lincpint expression as detected by IPGTT and ELISA. Immunohistochemistry indicated that positive islet area and expression of Pdx1 and Glut2 was reduced after Lincpint silencing in male BALB/c mouse. These findings suggest that Lincpint may play an important role in maintaining islet β cell function and is worthy of further investigation due to its potential in diabetes treatment.

Abstract: Excessive ethanol (EtOH) intake affects cognitive function and leads to permanent learning and memory deficits. EtOH-induced neuroinflammation plays an important role in EtOH neurotoxicity. Studies have shown that EtOH activates microglia and induces an inflammatory response. Resveratrol (Rsv) is a natural polyphenol found in a wide variety of plants and fruits, and produces the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system. However, effect of Rsv on EtOH-induced neuroinflammation is still unknown. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of Rsv in the context of EtOH-induced neurotoxicity and the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in the effect. The results showed that treatment of rats with Rsv prevented the deficits of spatial reference memory induced by EtOH and mitigated EtOH-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and decreasing the levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α. The further studies indicated that Rsv reduced TLR2 expression in vivo and in vitro, and downregulated expression of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and phosphorylation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). These data demonstrate that Rsv alleviates the ethanol-induced neuroinflammation via inhibition of TLR2-MyD88-NF-κB signal pathway.

Abstract: Ultraviolet ozone (UVO) treatment of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) appears to be a simple and efficient method for obtaining highly continuous and smooth silver (Ag) thin films in the thermally evaporated MoO3/Ag/MoO3 (MAM) multilayered structure as transparent electrodes for small-molecule organic solar cells (OSCs). It is observed that UVO treatment can oxidatively modify the non-stoichiometric MoO3 (or MoO3-x) surfaces, further increasing the Mo6+/Mo5+ composition ratio and work function of MoO3-x. Importantly, the use of UVO treatment for the MoO3 bottom layer effectively improves the wettability of Ag on MoO3 and enhances the lateral growth of Ag thin film, resulting in a reduction of the percolation threshold thickness of the continuous Ag layer. Due to the formation of an ultrathin Ag interlayer with a continuous and smooth surface morphology, the MAM multilayered electrode after UVO treatment of MoO3 for 3 min has excellent optical and electrical properties, including a high maximum transmittance of 89.1% and a low sheet resistance of 8.0 Ω/sq. When the optimal UVO-treated MoO3/Ag (7.5 nm)/MoO3 films are used as the anode in OSCs with the copper phthalocyanine (CuPc)/fullerene (C60) planar heterojunction structure, the OSCs have a power conversion efficiency of 0.55%, which is 2.0 and 1.2 times higher than that of devices with untreated MoO3/Ag (7.5 nm)/MoO3 (0.27%) and MoO3/Ag (10 nm)/MoO3 electrodes (0.46%), respectively, and competitive with that of indium-tin-oxide-based devices. Because of almost full surface coverage of the Ag interlayer, UVO treatment of MoO3 in MAM multilayered electrodes can improve charge carrier injection/extraction at the anode contact and hence improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Abstract: It is critical to understand the dominant recombination mechanisms of thin film solar cells for further improving their performance. The dominant recombination paths of CdTe solar cells with MgxZn1-xO (MZO), MZO/CdS and MZO/CdS/CdSe buffer layers were investigated by temperature-dependent current-voltage (JVT) characterization both in light and dark, with traditional CdS/CdTe devices as a reference. The devices with MZO or MZO/CdS buffer layers are confirmed to be dominated by interface recombination, which leads to poor performance of devices. Compared to devices with traditional CdS buffer layers which are dominated by bulk recombination, the devices with MZO/CdS/CdSe buffer layer exhibit the same dominant recombination path but superior performance. It demonstrates that MZO/CdS/CdSe can be a promising composite buffer layer.

Abstract: Hydrostatic pressure can be used as a powerful diagnostic tool to enable the study of lattice dynamics, defects, impurities and recombination processes in a variety of semiconductor materials and devices. Here we report on intermediate band GaAs solar cells containing GaSb quantum rings which exhibit a 15% increase in open-circuit voltage under application of 8 kbar hydrostatic pressure at room temperature. The pressure coefficients of the respective optical transitions for the GaSb quantum rings, the wetting layer and the GaAs bulk, were each measured to be ~ 10.5 ± 0.5 meV/kbar. A comparison of the pressure induced and temperature induced bandgap changes highlights the significance of the thermal energy of carriers in intermediate band solar cells.

Abstract: Optical characterization and simulations have been applied to study formamidinium + cesium lead triiodide (FA1-xCsxPbI3) perovskite based thin films and solar cells. Near infrared to ultraviolet complex dielectric function (ε = ε1 + iε2) spectra of varying cesium-to-formamidinium ratios in solution processed perovskite thin films have been extracted. Analysis of these ε spectra track changes in the positions of critical point (CP) energies, including band gaps and above band gap transitions, with increasing cesium contents. Band gap values are identified as the lowest energy CP, with additional sub-gap features attributed to the presence of defects. Absorption onset values, for which absorption coefficient (α) = 4000 cm−1, are extracted, with x = 0.2 showing the sharpest absorption edge and the least contribution to absorption from defects below the band gap. External quantum efficiency (EQE) simulations of solar cells using ε spectra as input are compared to experimental results and corroborate that the observed sub-gap absorption is due to defects as it does not contribute to EQE.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a potential complication during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and no specific recommendations exist regarding treatment of CDI in allogeneic SCT patients. Use of metronidazole and oral vancomycin has been associated with clinical failure. Fidaxomicin has previously been found noninferior to the use of oral vancomycin for the treatment of CDI, and no studies have compared the use of oral vancomycin with fidaxomicin for the treatment of CDI in allogeneic SCT.
Methods
This retrospective chart review included 96 allogeneic SCT recipients who developed CDI within 100 days following transplantation. Participants were treated with oral vancomycin (n = 52) or fidaxomicin (n = 44). The primary outcome was clinical cure, defined as no need for further retreatment 2 days following completion of initial CDI treatment. Secondary outcomes were global cure, treatment failure, and recurrent disease.
Results
No differences in clinical cure were observed between patients receiving oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin (75% vs. 75%, p = 1.00). Secondary outcomes were similar between oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin in regards to global cure (66% vs. 67%, p = .508), treatment failure (28% vs. 27%, p = .571), and recurrent disease (7% vs. 5%, p = .747). In a subanalysis of individuals that developed acute graft-versus-host disease following CDI, the difference in mean onset of acute graft-versus-host disease was 21.03 days in the oral vancomycin group versus 32.88 days in the fidaxomicin group (p = .0031).
Conclusion
The findings of this study suggest that oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin are comparable options for CDI treatment in allogeneic SCT patients within 100 days following transplant.

Abstract: Double perovskite ferroelectric Bi2FeMoxNi1-xO6 (BFMNO) thin films were fabricated using the sol-gel method. The thin films have a broad-band absorption in visible light range of 400–650 nm. With the increase of Mo content, the optical bandgap decreases from 2.19 eV to 2.07 eV. More importantly, the as-prepared BFMNO thin films have self-polarization behavior that causes the forming of the depolarization field and build-in field in the thin films. The narrow band gap and strong ferroelectric self-polarization play a crucial part in improving the photovoltaic effect. The thin film of x = 0.7 has the optimum open circuit voltage and short circuit current which are 5.41 V and 71.07 μA/cm2 under light illumination of 110 mW/cm2. In addition, the photovoltaic effect of the thin film also exhibits a good adaptability in high temperature environment. This work highlights the applications of the BFMNO thin films as a novel high-performance ferroelectric photovoltaic material.

Abstract: A non-ideal buffer-absorber interface due to interface recombination is one of the limitations in Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cells. An absorber gradient using partial cation-substitution is one possible solution to this issue by reducing interface recombination sites and improving band alignment. Partial substitution of Zn with Mn is a potentially attractive concept owing to its abundance as well as similar size and electronic properties compared to Zn. In this study, Cu2MnxZn1-xSnS4 (CMZTS) thin film were fabricated by a sol-gel spin coating technique to understand the effect of Mn on the device performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman analysis confirm Mn substitution for Zn in the crystal lattice of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) with no secondary phases detected for x ≤ 0.4. Enhancement of short circuit current (Jsc) in Cu2Mn0.15Zn0.85SnS4 has led to improved efficiency in comparison with CZTS. Since external quantum efficiency (EQE) indicates the short wavelength collection as the main reason for the improved Jsc, we designed a double layered structure of CZTS as bottom layer and CM0.15Z0.85TS as top layer. With this structure, we obtained our best performance cell with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.73% and Jsc of 17.86 mA/cm2. The improved Jsc is attributed to increased depletion width and higher activation energy of the limiting recombination mechanism as shown by capacitance-voltage and temperature dependent current-voltage measurements. Our study concludes that CM0.15Z0.85TS top layer improves the interface quality of the p-n junction and may be an alternative method to improve the performance of CZTS solar cells.

Abstract: In this study, a new microencapsulated phase change material, paraffin@titania (TiO2)/graphene oxide (GO), was prepared by in-situ hydrolysis and polycondensation of tetrabutyl titanate and the modification of GO on the TiO2 shell. The paraffin@TiO2/GO composite consisted of spherical particles with the diameters of 2–5 µm. Raman spectra analysis confirmed the compound of GO with the TiO2 shell. The melting temperature and latent heat of the paraffin@TiO2/GO composite were 60.04 °C and 74.99 J g−1, respectively, in which the encapsulation efficiency of paraffin was calculated to be 37.93%. It was noteworthy that the paraffin@TiO2/GO composite displayed better thermal stability than paraffin due to the shell material. Most of all, the novel heat transfer slurry prepared by dispersing the paraffin@TiO2/GO composite into water exhibited higher thermal conductivity, specific heat and light absorption properties along with outstanding photo-thermal conversion performance. The prepared paraffin@TiO2/GO composite with high heat storage capability and excellent photo-thermal conversion performance enable it to be a promising candidate in direct absorption solar collector for solar energy storage.
