Abstract: Summary
Cancer chemoresistance is often attributed to slow-cycling persister populations with cancer stem cell (CSC)-like features. However, how persister populations emerge and prevail in cancer remains obscure. We previously demonstrated that while the NOX1-mTORC1 pathway is responsible for proliferation of a fast-cycling CSC population, PROX1 expression is required for chemoresistant persisters in colon cancer. Here, we show that enhanced autolysosomal activity mediated by mTORC1 inhibition induces PROX1 expression and that PROX1 induction in turn inhibits NOX1-mTORC1 activation. CDX2, identified as a transcriptional activator of NOX1, mediates PROX1-dependent NOX1 inhibition. PROX1-positive and CDX2-positive cells are present in distinct populations, and mTOR inhibition triggers conversion of the CDX2-positive population to the PROX1-positive population. Inhibition of autophagy synergizes with mTOR inhibition to block cancer proliferation. Thus, mTORC1 inhibition-mediated induction of PROX1 stabilizes a persister-like state with high autolysosomal activity via a feedback regulation that involves a key cascade of proliferating CSCs.

Abstract: The ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR) is a key player in Ca2+ handling during excitation-contraction coupling. During each heartbeat, RyR channels are responsible for linking the action potential with the contractile machinery of the cardiomyocyte by releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. RyR function is fine-tuned by associated signalling molecules, arrangement in clusters and subcellular localization. These parameters together define RyR function within microdomains and are subject to disease remodelling. This review describes the latest findings on RyR microdomain organization, the alterations with disease which result in increased subcellular heterogeneity and emergence of microdomains with enhanced arrhythmogenic potential, and presents novel technologies that guide future research to study and target RyR channels within specific microdomains.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) are known to cause rare forms of diabetes and alter hepatic physiology through unclear mechanisms. In the general population, 1:100 individuals carry a rare, protein-coding HNF1A variant, most of unknown functional consequence. To characterize the full allelic series, we performed deep mutational scanning of 11,970 protein-coding HNF1A variants in human hepatocytes and clinical correlation with 553,246 exome-sequenced individuals. Surprisingly, we found that ∼1:5 rare protein-coding HNF1A variants in the general population cause molecular gain of function (GOF), increasing the transcriptional activity of HNF1A by up to 50% and conferring protection from type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77, p = 0.007). Increased hepatic expression of HNF1A promoted a pro-atherogenic serum profile mediated in part by enhanced transcription of risk genes including ANGPTL3 and PCSK9. In summary, ∼1:300 individuals carry a GOF variant in HNF1A that protects carriers from diabetes but enhances hepatic secretion of atherogenic lipoproteins.

Abstract: Summary
Amyloid-β (Aβ) plays an important role in the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but some factors promoting Aβ generation and Aβ oligomer (Aβo) neurotoxicity remain unclear. We here find that the levels of ArhGAP11A, a Ras homology GTPase-activating protein, significantly increase in patients with AD and amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mice. Reducing the ArhGAP11A level in neurons not only inhibits Aβ generation by decreasing the expression of APP, PS1, and β-secretase (BACE1) through the RhoA/ROCK/Erk signaling pathway but also reduces Aβo neurotoxicity by decreasing the expressions of apoptosis-related p53 target genes. In APP/PS1 mice, specific reduction of the ArhGAP11A level in neurons significantly reduces Aβ production and plaque deposition and ameliorates neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. Moreover, Aβos enhance ArhGAP11A expression in neurons by activating E2F1, which thus forms a deleterious cycle. Our results demonstrate that ArhGAP11A may be involved in AD pathogenesis and that decreasing ArhGAP11A expression may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Polysialic acid (polySia) is a post-translational modification of a select group of cell-surface proteins that guides cellular interactions. As the overall impact of changes in expression of this glycan on leukocytes during infection is not known, we evaluate the immune response of polySia-deficient ST8SiaIV−/− mice infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn). Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, ST8SiaIV−/− mice are less susceptible to infection and clear Spn from airways faster, with alveolar macrophages demonstrating greater viability and phagocytic activity. Leukocyte pulmonary recruitment, paradoxically, is diminished in infected ST8SiaIV−/− mice, corroborated by adoptive cell transfer, microfluidic migration experiments, and intravital microscopy, and possibly explained by dysregulated ERK1/2 signaling. PolySia is progressively lost from neutrophils and monocytes migrating from bone marrow to alveoli in Spn-infected WT mice, consistent with changing cellular functions. These data highlight multidimensional effects of polySia on leukocytes during an immune response and suggest therapeutic interventions for optimizing immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in humans. Activation of the pathway relies on loading of the FANCD2/FANCI complex onto chromosomes, where it is fully activated by subsequent monoubiquitination. However, the mechanism for loading the complex onto chromosomes remains unclear. Here, we identify 10 SQ/TQ phosphorylation sites on FANCD2, which are phosphorylated by ATR in response to ICLs. Using a range of biochemical assays complemented with live-cell imaging including super-resolution single-molecule tracking, we show that these phosphorylation events are critical for loading of the complex onto chromosomes and for its subsequent monoubiquitination. We uncover how the phosphorylation events are tightly regulated in cells and that mimicking their constant phosphorylation leads to an uncontrolled active state of FANCD2, which is loaded onto chromosomes in an unrestrained fashion. Taken together, we describe a mechanism where ATR triggers FANCD2/FANCI loading onto chromosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Neural progenitor cells lengthen their cell cycle to prime themselves for differentiation as development proceeds. It is currently not clear how they counter this lengthening and avoid being halted in the cell cycle. We show that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of cell-cycle-related mRNAs ensures the proper cell-cycle progression of late-born retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), which are born toward the end of retinogenesis and have long cell-cycle length. Conditional deletion of Mettl14, which is required for depositing m6A, led to delayed cell-cycle exit of late-born RPCs but has no effect on retinal development prior to birth. m6A sequencing and single-cell transcriptomics revealed that mRNAs involved in elongating the cell cycle were highly enriched for m6A, which could target them for degradation and guarantee proper cell-cycle progression. In addition, we identified Zfp292 as a target of m6A and potent inhibitor of RPC cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
Insertions and deletions (indels) are common sources of structural variation, and insertions originating from spontaneous DNA lesions are frequent in cancer. We developed a highly sensitive assay called insertion and deletion sequencing (Indel-seq) to monitor rearrangements in human cells at the TRIM37 acceptor locus that reports indels stemming from experimentally induced and spontaneous genome instability. Templated insertions, which derive from sequences genome wide, require contact between donor and acceptor loci, require homologous recombination, and are stimulated by DNA end-processing. Insertions are facilitated by transcription and involve a DNA/RNA hybrid intermediate. Indel-seq reveals that insertions are generated via multiple pathways. The broken acceptor site anneals with a resected DNA break or invades the displaced strand of a transcription bubble or R-loop, followed by DNA synthesis, displacement, and then ligation by non-homologous end joining. Our studies identify transcription-coupled insertions as a critical source of spontaneous genome instability that is distinct from cut-and-paste events.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common subtype of thyroid carcinoma. Despite a good prognosis, approximately a quarter of PTC patients are likely to relapse. Previous reports suggest an association between S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) and the prognosis of thyroid cancer. SKP1 is related to apoptosis of PTC cells; however, its role in PTC remains largely elusive. This study aimed to understand the expression and molecular mechanism of SKP2 in PTC. SKP2 expression was upregulated in PTC tissues and closely associated with clinical diagnosis. In vitro and in vivo knockdown of SKP2 expression in PTC cells suppressed cell growth and proliferation and induced apoptosis. SKP2 depletion promoted cell autophagy under glucose deprivation. SKP2 interacted with PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase-1 (PHLPP1), triggering its degradation by ubiquitination. Furthermore, SKP2 activates the AKT-related pathways via PHLPP1, which leads to the cytoplasmic translocation of SKP2, indicating a reciprocal regulation between SKP2 and AKT. In conclusion, the upregulation of SKP2 leads to PTC proliferation and survival, and the regulatory network among SKP2, PHLPP1, and AKT provides novel insight into the molecular basis of SKP2 in tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Everyday episodic memories involve linking together related events that are temporally separated. However, the mechanisms of forming this temporal association have remained unclear. Here, using astrocyte-specific manipulations, we show that potentiating astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) enhances the strength of such temporal association, in parallel with long-term potentiation (LTP) enhancement of temporoammonic pathway to CA1, whereas attenuation of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling has the opposite effect. Moreover, we identify that these effects are mediated by astrocytic α4 subunit-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α4-nAChRs) via mechanisms involving NMDAR co-agonist supply. Finally, astrocytic α4-nAChRs underlie the cognitive enhancer nicotine’s physiological effects. Together, these findings highlight the importance of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in cognitive behavior and reveal a mechanism in governing the temporal association of episodic memory formation that operates through α4-nAChRs on hippocampal astrocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity, in which the functional importance of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) remains elusive, correlates with risk for many cancer types. Here, we identify that the serum copies of adipocyte-expressed SNORD46 correlate with body mass index (BMI), and serum SNORD46 antagonizes interleukin-15 (IL-15) signaling. Mechanically, SNORD46 binds IL-15 via G11, and G11A (a mutation that significantly enhances binding affinity) knockin drives obesity in mice. Functionally, SNORD46 blocks IL-15-induced, FER kinase-dependent phosphorylation of platelet glycoprotein 4 (CD36) and monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) in adipocytes, leading to inhibited lipolysis and browning. In natural killer (NK) cells, SNORD46 suppresses the IL-15-dependent autophagy, leading to reduced viability of obese NK. SNORD46 power inhibitors exhibit anti-obesity effects, concurring with improved viability of obese NK and anti-tumor immunity of CAR-NK cell therapy. Hence, our findings demonstrate the functional importance of snoRNAs in obesity and the utility of snoRNA power inhibitors for antagonizing obesity-associated immune resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Cells adjust their metabolism by remodeling membrane contact sites that channel metabolites to different fates. Lipid droplet (LD)-mitochondria contacts change in response to fasting, cold exposure, and exercise. However, their function and mechanism of formation have remained controversial. We focused on perilipin 5 (PLIN5), an LD protein that tethers mitochondria, to probe the function and regulation of LD-mitochondria contacts. We demonstrate that efficient LD-to-mitochondria fatty acid (FA) trafficking and ß-oxidation during starvation of myoblasts are promoted by phosphorylation of PLIN5 and require an intact PLIN5 mitochondrial tethering domain. Using human and murine cells, we further identified the acyl-CoA synthetase, FATP4 (ACSVL4), as a mitochondrial interactor of PLIN5. The C-terminal domains of PLIN5 and FATP4 constitute a minimal protein interaction capable of inducing organelle contacts. Our work suggests that starvation leads to phosphorylation of PLIN5, lipolysis, and subsequent channeling of FAs from LDs to FATP4 on mitochondria for conversion to fatty-acyl-CoAs and subsequent oxidation.

Abstract: The incidence of allergic asthma has been increasing worldwide in recent decades. Also, an increasing number of women are suffering from poor pregnancy outcome. However, the causal relationship between allergic asthma and embryonic growth in terms of cell morphogenesis has not been well elucidated. Here, we investigated the impact of allergic asthma on the morphogenesis of preimplantation embryos. Twenty-four female BALB/c were randomly divided into control (PBS), 50-μg (OVA1), 100-μg (OVA2) and 150-μg (OVA3). On Days-0 and -14, mice were induced intraperitoneally (i.p) with ovalbumin (OVA). On Days-21 until −23, mice were challenged with OVA via intranasal instillation (i.n). Control animals were sensitized and challenged with PBS. At the end of treatment (Day-25), 2-cell embryos were retrieved and cultured in vitro until the blastocysts hatched. Results showed reduced number of preimplantation embryos at all developing stages in all treated groups (p ≤ 0.0001). Uneven blastomere size, partial compaction- and cavitation-activity, low formation of trophectoderm (TE), as well as cell fragmentation were noted in all the treated groups. Maternal serum interleukin (IL)-4, immunoglobulin (Ig)-E and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were notably high (p ≤ 0.0001, p ≤ 0.01) in contrast with low total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) (p ≤ 0.0001). Our findings indicated that OVA-induced allergic asthma had compromised cell morphogenesis through reduced blastomere cleavage division, partial compaction and cavitation-activity, impairment of TE production, and cell fragmentation leading to embryonic cell death via OS mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Dermal adipocyte lineage cells are highly plastic and can undergo reversible differentiation and dedifferentiation in response to various stimuli. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of developing or wounded mouse skin, we classify dermal fibroblasts (dFBs) into distinct non-adipogenic and adipogenic cell states. Cell differentiation trajectory analyses identify IL-1-NF-κB and WNT-β-catenin as top signaling pathways that positively and negatively associate with adipogenesis, respectively. Upon wounding, activation of adipocyte progenitors and wound-induced adipogenesis are mediated in part by neutrophils through the IL-1R-NF-κB-CREB signaling axis. In contrast, WNT activation, by WNT ligand and/or ablation of Gsk3, inhibits the adipogenic potential of dFBs but promotes lipolysis and dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes, contributing to myofibroblast formation. Finally, sustained WNT activation and inhibition of adipogenesis is seen in human keloids. These data reveal molecular mechanisms underlying the plasticity of dermal adipocyte lineage cells, defining potential therapeutic targets for defective wound healing and scar formation.

Abstract: Summary
Coat protein complex II (COPII) plays an integral role in the packaging of secretory cargoes within membrane-enclosed transport carriers that leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from discrete subdomains. Lipid bilayer remodeling necessary for this process is driven initially by membrane penetration mediated by the Sar1 GTPase and further stabilized by assembly of a multilayered complex of several COPII proteins. However, the relative contributions of these distinct factors to transport carrier formation and protein trafficking remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that anterograde cargo transport from the ER continues in the absence of Sar1, although the efficiency of this process is dramatically reduced. Specifically, secretory cargoes are retained nearly five times longer at ER subdomains when Sar1 is depleted, but they ultimately remain capable of being translocated to the perinuclear region of cells. Taken together, our findings highlight alternative mechanisms by which COPII promotes transport carrier biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Stochasticity has emerged as a mechanism of gene regulation. Much of this so-called “noise” has been attributed to bursting transcription. Although bursting transcription has been studied extensively, the role of stochasticity in translation has not been fully investigated due to the lack of enabling imaging technology. In this study, we developed techniques to track single mRNAs and their translation in live cells for hours, allowing the measurement of previously uncharacterized translation dynamics. We applied genetic and pharmacological perturbations to control translation kinetics and found that, like transcription, translation is not a constitutive process but instead cycles between inactive and active states, or “bursts.” However, unlike transcription, which is largely frequency-modulated, complex structures in the 5′-untranslated region alter burst amplitudes. Bursting frequency can be controlled through cap-proximal sequences and trans-acting factors such as eIF4F. We coupled single-molecule imaging with stochastic modeling to quantitatively determine the kinetic parameters of translational bursting.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a process initiated by activation of endothelial TGF-β signaling, underlies numerous chronic vascular diseases and fibrotic states. Once induced, EndMT leads to a further increase in TGF-β signaling, thus establishing a positive-feedback loop with EndMT leading to more EndMT. Although EndMT is understood at the cellular level, the molecular basis of TGF-β-driven EndMT induction and persistence remains largely unknown. Here, we show that metabolic modulation of the endothelium, triggered by atypical production of acetate from glucose, underlies TGF-β-driven EndMT. Induction of EndMT suppresses the expression of the enzyme PDK4, which leads to an increase in ACSS2-dependent Ac-CoA synthesis from pyruvate-derived acetate. This increased Ac-CoA production results in acetylation of the TGF-β receptor ALK5 and SMADs 2 and 4 leading to activation and long-term stabilization of TGF-β signaling. Our results establish the metabolic basis of EndMT persistence and unveil novel targets, such as ACSS2, for the potential treatment of chronic vascular diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key protein in inflammation and contributes to tumor progression. However, the role of IL-1β in cancer is ambiguous or even contradictory. Here, we found that upon IL-1β stimulation, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) in cancer cells is acetylated at lysine (K) 1042 (NNT K1042ac) and thereby induces the mitochondrial translocation of p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). This acetylation enhances NNT activity by increasing the binding affinity of NNT for NADP+ and therefore boosts NADPH production, which subsequently sustains sufficient iron-sulfur cluster maintenance and protects tumor cells from ferroptosis. Abrogating NNT K1042ac dramatically attenuates IL-1β-promoted tumor immune evasion and synergizes with PD-1 blockade. In addition, NNT K1042ac is associated with IL-1β expression and the prognosis of human gastric cancer. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism of IL-1β-promoted tumor immune evasion, implicating the therapeutic potential of disrupting the link between IL-1β and tumor cells by inhibiting NNT acetylation.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis, triggers multiple sclerosis, and is associated with 200,000 cancers/year. EBV colonizes the human B cell compartment and periodically reactivates, inducing expression of 80 viral proteins. However, much remains unknown about how EBV remodels host cells and dismantles key antiviral responses. We therefore created a map of EBV-host and EBV-EBV interactions in B cells undergoing EBV replication, uncovering conserved herpesvirus versus EBV-specific host cell targets. The EBV-encoded G-protein-coupled receptor BILF1 associated with MAVS and the UFM1 E3 ligase UFL1. Although UFMylation of 14-3-3 proteins drives RIG-I/MAVS signaling, BILF1-directed MAVS UFMylation instead triggered MAVS packaging into mitochondrial-derived vesicles and lysosomal proteolysis. In the absence of BILF1, EBV replication activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, which impaired viral replication and triggered pyroptosis. Our results provide a viral protein interaction network resource, reveal a UFM1-dependent pathway for selective degradation of mitochondrial cargo, and highlight BILF1 as a novel therapeutic target.

Abstract: Artibeus lituratus is one of the most well-known bat species in the Neotropics, probably due to its high abundance and the ability to inhabit urban areas. It plays an important ecological role in the ecosystem due to its ability to disperse seeds, which contributes to the regeneration of degraded areas. Actually, the species has been used as an important experimental model for ecotoxicological studies of the impact of pesticides on male reproduction. Despite that, the reproductive pattern of A. lituratus is still controversial due to inconsistent descriptions of the reproductive cycle. Thus, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the annual variations of the testicular parameters and sperm quality of A. lituratus and analyze their responses to annual variations in abiotic factors in the Cerrado area in Brazil. Testes of five specimens were collected each month for one year (12 sample groups) and submitted to histological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical analyses. Analyses of the sperm quality were also performed. Results demonstrate that A. lituratus presents a continuously active process of spermatogenesis throughout the year, with two significant peaks in spermatogenic production (September-October and March), which indicates a bimodal polyestric pattern of reproduction. These reproductive peaks seem to be related to an increase in proliferation and, consequently, in the number of spermatogonia. Conversely, seasonal variations in testicular parameters are correlated with annual fluctuations in rainfall and photoperiod but not with temperature. In general, the species presents smaller spermatogenic indexes with a similar sperm quantity and quality to other bat species.

Abstract: Summary
In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete with one another within a post-synaptic cell. Here, we investigate how a mitral cell in the mouse olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the mouse barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) store lipids that can be utilized during times of scarcity via autophagic and lysosomal pathways, but how LDs and autophagosomes interact remained unclear. Here, we discovered that the E2 autophagic enzyme, ATG3, localizes to the surface of certain ultra-large LDs in differentiated murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes or Huh7 human liver cells undergoing prolonged starvation. Subsequently, ATG3 lipidates microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3B (LC3B) to these LDs. In vitro, ATG3 could bind alone to purified and artificial LDs to mediate this lipidation reaction. We observed that LC3B-lipidated LDs were consistently in close proximity to collections of LC3B-membranes and were lacking Plin1. This phenotype is distinct from macrolipophagy, but it required autophagy because it disappeared following ATG5 or Beclin1 knockout. Our data suggest that extended starvation triggers a noncanonical autophagy mechanism, similar to LC3B-associated phagocytosis, in which the surface of large LDs serves as an LC3B lipidation platform for autophagic processes.

Abstract: Summary
Heart development begins with the formation of a tube as cardiac progenitors migrate from opposite sides of the embryo. Abnormal cardiac progenitor movements cause congenital heart defects. However, the mechanisms of cell migration during early heart development remain poorly understood. Using quantitative microscopy, we found that in Drosophila embryos, cardiac progenitors (cardioblasts) migrated through a sequence of forward and backward steps. Cardioblast steps were associated with oscillatory non-muscle myosin II waves that induced periodic shape changes and were necessary for timely heart tube formation. Mathematical modeling predicted that forward cardioblast migration required a stiff boundary at the trailing edge. Consistent with this, we found a supracellular actin cable at the trailing edge of the cardioblasts that limited the amplitude of the backward steps, thus biasing the direction of cell movement. Our results indicate that periodic shape changes coupled with a polarized actin cable produce asymmetrical forces that promote cardioblast migration.

Abstract: Summary
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) signaling often drives opposing effects in traumatic versus demyelinating CNS disorders. Here, we identify two distinct phenotypes of microglia and infiltrating myeloid populations dependent on TREM2 expression levels at the acute stage and elucidate how they mediate the opposing effects of TREM2 in spinal cord injury (SCI) versus multiple sclerosis animal models (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE]). High TREM2 levels sustain phagocytic microglia and infiltrating macrophages after SCI. In contrast, moderate TREM2 levels sustain immunomodulatory microglia and infiltrating monocytes in EAE. TREM2-ablated microglia (purine-sensing phenotype in SCI and reduced immunomodulatory phenotype in EAE) drive transient protection at the acute stage of both disorders, whereas reduced phagocytic macrophages and lysosome-activated monocytes lead to contrasting neuroprotective and demyelinating effects in SCI versus EAE, respectively. Our study provides comprehensive insights into the complex roles of TREM2 in myeloid populations across diverse CNS disorders, which has crucial implications in devising TREM2-targeting therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells (GSCs) display phenotypic and molecular features reminiscent of normal neural stem cells and exhibit a spectrum of cell cycle states (dormant, quiescent, proliferative). However, mechanisms controlling the transition from quiescence to proliferation in both neural stem cells (NSCs) and GSCs are poorly understood. Elevated expression of the forebrain transcription factor FOXG1 is often observed in GBMs. Here, using small-molecule modulators and genetic perturbations, we identify a synergistic interaction between FOXG1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Increased FOXG1 enhances Wnt-driven transcriptional targets, enabling highly efficient cell cycle re-entry from quiescence; however, neither FOXG1 nor Wnt is essential in rapidly proliferating cells. We demonstrate that FOXG1 overexpression supports gliomagenesis in vivo and that additional β-catenin induction drives accelerated tumor growth. These data indicate that elevated FOXG1 cooperates with Wnt signaling to support the transition from quiescence to proliferation in GSCs.

Abstract: The heart is a complex organ composed of distinct cell types, such as cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells and immune cells. All these cell types contribute to the structural, electrical and mechanical properties of the heart. Genetic manipulation and lineage tracing studies in mice have been instrumental in gaining critical insights into the networks regulating cardiac cell lineage specification, cell fate and plasticity. Such knowledge has been of fundamental importance for the development of efficient protocols for the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in highly specialized cardiac cell types. In this review, we summarize the evolution and current advances in protocols for cardiac subtype specification, maturation, and assembly in cardiac microtissues and organoids.

Abstract: Summary
Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands are viewed as promising targets for cancer treatment; however, targeting them is hindered by their context-dependent functionalities. To circumvent this, we explore molecular landscapes underlying their pro- and anti-malignant activities. Using unbiased bioinformatics approaches, we construct a cancer-related network of genetic interactions (GIs) of all Ephs and ephrins to assist in their therapeutic manipulation. We also apply genetic screening and BioID proteomics and integrate them with machine learning approaches to select the most relevant GIs of one Eph receptor, EPHB6. This identifies a crosstalk between EPHB6 and EGFR, and further experiments confirm the ability of EPHB6 to modulate EGFR signaling, enhancing the proliferation of cancer cells and tumor development. Taken together, our observations show EPHB6 involvement in EGFR action, suggesting its targeting might be beneficial in EGFR-dependent tumors, and confirm that the Eph family genetic interactome presented here can be effectively exploited in developing cancer treatment approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose dependency of cancer cells can be targeted with a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD). However, in IL-6-producing cancers, suppression of the hepatic ketogenic potential hinders the utilization of KD as energy for the organism. In IL-6-associated murine models of cancer cachexia, we describe delayed tumor growth but accelerated cachexia onset and shortened survival in mice fed KD. Mechanistically, this uncoupling is a consequence of the biochemical interaction of two NADPH-dependent pathways. Within the tumor, increased lipid peroxidation and, consequently, saturation of the glutathione (GSH) system lead to the ferroptotic death of cancer cells. Systemically, redox imbalance and NADPH depletion impair corticosterone biosynthesis. Administration of dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, increases food intake, normalizes glucose levels and utilization of nutritional substrates, delays cachexia onset, and extends the survival of tumor-bearing mice fed KD while preserving reduced tumor growth. Our study emphasizes the need to investigate the effects of systemic interventions on both the tumor and the host to accurately assess therapeutic potential. These findings may be relevant to clinical research efforts that investigate nutritional interventions such as KD in patients with cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The acquisition of mesenchymal traits is considered a hallmark of breast cancer progression. However, the functional relevance of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains controversial and context dependent. Here, we isolate epithelial and mesenchymal populations from human breast cancer metastatic biopsies and assess their functional potential in vivo. Strikingly, progressively decreasing epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) levels correlate with declining disease propagation. Mechanistically, we find that persistent EPCAM expression marks epithelial clones that resist EMT induction and propagate competitively. In contrast, loss of EPCAM defines clones arrested in a mesenchymal state, with concomitant suppression of tumorigenicity and metastatic potential. This dichotomy results from distinct clonal trajectories impacting global epigenetic programs that are determined by the interplay between human ZEB1 and its target GRHL2. Collectively, our results indicate that susceptibility to irreversible EMT restrains clonal propagation, whereas resistance to mesenchymal reprogramming sustains disease spread in multiple models of human metastatic breast cancer, including patient-derived cells in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The magnitude of neuronal activation is commonly considered a critical factor for conscious perception of visual content. However, this dogma contrasts with the phenomenon of rapid adaptation, in which the magnitude of neuronal activation drops dramatically in a rapid manner while the visual stimulus and the conscious experience it elicits remain stable. Here, we report that the profiles of multi-site activation patterns and their relational geometry—i.e., the similarity distances between activation patterns, as revealed using intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings—are sustained during extended visual stimulation despite the major magnitude decrease. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that conscious perceptual content is associated with the neuronal pattern profiles and their similarity distances, rather than the overall activation magnitude, in human visual cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV can reduce viral transmission in humans, but an effective therapeutic will require unusually high breadth and potency of neutralization. We employ the OSPREY computational protein design software to engineer variants of two apex-directed bNAbs, PGT145 and PG9RSH, resulting in increases in potency of over 100-fold against some viruses. The top designed variants improve neutralization breadth from 39% to 54% at clinically relevant concentrations (IC80 < 1 μg/mL) and improve median potency (IC80) by up to 4-fold over a cross-clade panel of 208 strains. To investigate the mechanisms of improvement, we determine cryoelectron microscopy structures of each variant in complex with the HIV envelope trimer. Surprisingly, we find the largest increases in breadth to be a result of optimizing side-chain interactions with highly variable epitope residues. These results provide insight into mechanisms of neutralization breadth and inform strategies for antibody design and improvement.

Abstract: Summary
Aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) display diminished self-renewal and a myeloid differentiation bias. However, the drivers and mechanisms that underpin this fundamental switch are not understood. HSCs produce genotoxic formaldehyde that requires protection by the detoxification enzymes ALDH2 and ADH5 and the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. We find that the HSCs in young Aldh2−/− Fancd2−/− mice harbor a transcriptomic signature equivalent to aged wild-type HSCs, along with increased epigenetic age, telomere attrition, and myeloid-biased differentiation quantified by single HSC transplantation. In addition, the p53 response is vigorously activated in Aldh2−/− Fancd2−/− HSCs, while p53 deletion rescued this aged HSC phenotype. To further define the origins of the myeloid differentiation bias, we use a GFP genetic reporter to find a striking enrichment of Vwf+ myeloid and megakaryocyte-lineage-biased HSCs. These results indicate that metabolism-derived formaldehyde-DNA damage stimulates the p53 response in HSCs to drive accelerated aging.

Abstract: Summary
Cell extrusion is a universal mode of cell removal from tissues, and it plays an important role in regulating cell numbers and eliminating unwanted cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of cell delamination from the cell layer are unclear. Here, we report a conserved execution mechanism of apoptotic cell extrusion. We found extracellular vesicle (EV) formation in extruding mammalian and Drosophila cells at a site opposite to the extrusion direction. Lipid-scramblase-mediated local exposure of phosphatidylserine is responsible for EV formation and is crucial for executing cell extrusion. Inhibition of this process disrupts prompt cell delamination and tissue homeostasis. Although the EV has hallmarks of an apoptotic body, its formation is governed by the mechanism of microvesicle formation. Experimental and mathematical modeling analysis illustrated that EV formation promotes neighboring cells’ invasion. This study showed that membrane dynamics play a crucial role in cell exit by connecting the actions of the extruding cell and neighboring cells.

Histone H3 lysine 27 crotonylation mediates gene transcriptional repression in chromatin,

Abstract: Summary
Histone lysine acylation, including acetylation and crotonylation, plays a pivotal role in gene transcription in health and diseases. However, our understanding of histone lysine acylation has been limited to gene transcriptional activation. Here, we report that histone H3 lysine 27 crotonylation (H3K27cr) directs gene transcriptional repression rather than activation. Specifically, H3K27cr in chromatin is selectively recognized by the YEATS domain of GAS41 in complex with SIN3A-HDAC1 co-repressors. Proto-oncogenic transcription factor MYC recruits GAS41/SIN3A-HDAC1 complex to repress genes in chromatin, including cell-cycle inhibitor p21. GAS41 knockout or H3K27cr-binding depletion results in p21 de-repression, cell-cycle arrest, and tumor growth inhibition in mice, explaining a causal relationship between GAS41 and MYC gene amplification and p21 downregulation in colorectal cancer. Our study suggests that H3K27 crotonylation signifies a previously unrecognized, distinct chromatin state for gene transcriptional repression in contrast to H3K27 trimethylation for transcriptional silencing and H3K27 acetylation for transcriptional activation.

Abstract: Summary
During mouse embryogenesis, expression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Airn leads to gene repression and recruitment of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) to varying extents over a 15-Mb domain. The mechanisms remain unclear. Using high-resolution approaches, we show in mouse trophoblast stem cells that Airn expression induces long-range changes to chromatin architecture that coincide with PRC-directed modifications and center around CpG island promoters that contact the Airn locus even in the absence of Airn expression. Intensity of contact between the Airn lncRNA and chromatin correlated with underlying intensity of PRC recruitment and PRC-directed modifications. Deletion of CpG islands that contact the Airn locus altered long-distance repression and PRC activity in a manner that correlated with changes in chromatin architecture. Our data imply that the extent to which Airn expression recruits PRCs to chromatin is controlled by DNA regulatory elements that modulate proximity of the Airn lncRNA product to its target DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Acidic environments reduce the intracellular pH (pHi) of most cells to levels that are sub-optimal for growth and cellular functions. Yet, cancers maintain an alkaline cytoplasm despite low extracellular pH (pHe). Raised pHi is thought to be beneficial for tumor progression and invasiveness. However, the transport mechanisms underpinning this adaptation have not been studied systematically. Here, we characterize the pHe-pHi relationship in 66 colorectal cancer cell lines and identify the acid-loading anion exchanger 2 (AE2, SLC4A2) as a regulator of resting pHi. Cells adapt to chronic extracellular acidosis by degrading AE2 protein, which raises pHi and reduces acid sensitivity of growth. Acidity inhibits mTOR signaling, which stimulates lysosomal function and AE2 degradation, a process reversed by bafilomycin A1. We identify AE2 degradation as a mechanism for maintaining a conducive pHi in tumors. As an adaptive mechanism, inhibiting lysosomal degradation of AE2 is a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Polarity proteins regulate the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors to generate neurons during brain development through multiple signaling pathways. However, how cell polarity couples the signaling pathways remains unclear. Here, we show that coiled-coil domain-containing protein 85c (Ccdc85c) interacts with the polarity protein Par3 to regulate the proliferation of radial glial cells (RGCs) via phase separation coupled to percolation (PSCP). We find that the interaction with Ccdc85c relieves the intramolecular auto-inhibition of Par3, which leads to PSCP of Par3. Downregulation of Ccdc85c causes RGC differentiation. Importantly, the open conformation of Par3 facilitates the recruitment of the Notch regulator Numb to the Par3 condensates, which might prevent the attenuation of Notch activity to maintain RGC proliferation. Furthermore, ectopic activation of Notch signaling rescues RGC proliferation defects caused by the downregulation of Ccdc85c. These results suggest that Ccdc85c-mediated PSCP of Par3 regulates Notch signaling to control RGC proliferation during brain development.

Abstract: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (HUCMSCs) are an emerging source of cell therapy due to their self-renew and differentiation ability. They can differentiate into three germ layers, including the potential to generate hepatocytes. This study determined the transplantation efficiency and suitability of HUCMSCs-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) for their therapeutic application for liver diseases. This study aims to formulate ideal conditions to induce HUCMSCs into the hepatic lineage and investigate the efficiency of the differentiated HLCs based on their expression characteristics and capacity to integrate into the damaged liver of CCl4-challenged mice. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Activin A, Wnt3a were found to optimally promote the endodermal expansion of HUCMSCs, which showed phenomenal expression of hepatic markers upon differentiation in the presence of oncostatin M and dexamethasone. HUCMSCs expressed MSC-related surface markers and could undergo tri-lineage differentiations. Two hepatogenic differentiation protocols (differentiated hepatocyte protocol 1 [DHC1]: 32 days and DHC2: 15 days) were experimented with. The proliferation rate was faster in DHC2 than in DHC1 on day 7 of differentiation. The migration capability was the same in both DHC1 and DHC2. Hepatic markers like CK18, CK19, ALB, and AFP were upregulated. The mRNA levels of albumin, α1AT, αFP, CK18, TDO2, CYP3A4, CYP7A1, HNF4A, CEBPA, PPARA, and PAH were even higher in the HUCMSCs-derived HCLs than in the primary hepatocytes. Western blot confirmed HNF3B and CK18 protein expression in a step-wise manner differentiated from HUCMSCs. The metabolic function of differentiated hepatocytes was evident by increasing PAS staining and urea production. Pre-treating HUCMSCs with a hepatic differentiation medium containing HGF can drive their differentiation towards endodermal and hepatic lineages, enabling efficient integration into the damaged liver. This approach represents a potential alternative protocol for cell-based therapy that could enhance the integration potential of HUCMSC-derived HLCs.

Abstract: High-throughput quantification of the first- and second-phase insulin secretion dynamics is intractable with current methods. The fact that independent secretion phases play distinct roles in metabolism necessitates partitioning them separately and performing high-throughput compound screening to target them individually. We developed an insulin-nanoluc luciferase reporter system to dissect the molecular and cellular pathways involved in the separate phases of insulin secretion. We validated this method through genetic studies, including knockdown and overexpression, as well as small-molecule screening and their effects on insulin secretion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the results of this method are well correlated with those of single-vesicle exocytosis experiments conducted on live cells, providing a quantitative reference for the approach. Thus, we have developed a robust methodology for screening small molecules and cellular pathways that target specific phases of insulin secretion, resulting in a better understanding of insulin secretion, which in turn will result in a more effective insulin therapy through the stimulation of endogenous glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Certain serum proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer, have prognostic value in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Nonetheless, these factors are non-specific, providing limited mechanistic insight into the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations that drive the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. To identify cellular phenotypes associated with disease, we performed a comprehensive, unbiased analysis of total and plasma-membrane PBMC proteomes from 40 unvaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2, spanning the whole disease spectrum. Combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and flow cytometry from the same donors, we define a comprehensive multi-omic profile for each severity level, revealing that immune-cell dysregulation progresses with increasing disease. The cell-surface proteins CEACAMs1, 6, and 8, CD177, CD63, and CD89 are strongly associated with severe COVID-19, corresponding to the emergence of atypical CD3+CD4+CEACAM1/6/8+CD177+CD63+CD89+ and CD16+CEACAM1/6/8+ mononuclear cells. Utilization of these markers may facilitate real-time patient assessment by flow cytometry and identify immune populations that could be targeted to ameliorate immunopathology.

Abstract: Summary
The first step of oncogenesis is the acquisition of a repertoire of genetic mutations to initiate and sustain the malignancy. An important example of this initiation phase in acute leukemias is the formation of a potent oncogene by chromosomal translocations between the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene and one of 100 translocation partners, known as the MLL recombinome. Here, we show that circular RNAs (circRNAs)—a family of covalently closed, alternatively spliced RNA molecules—are enriched within the MLL recombinome and can bind DNA, forming circRNA:DNA hybrids (circR loops) at their cognate loci. These circR loops promote transcriptional pausing, proteasome inhibition, chromatin re-organization, and DNA breakage. Importantly, overexpressing circRNAs in mouse leukemia xenograft models results in co-localization of genomic loci, de novo generation of clinically relevant chromosomal translocations mimicking the MLL recombinome, and hastening of disease onset. Our findings provide fundamental insight into the acquisition of chromosomal translocations by endogenous RNA carcinogens in leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular chaperones govern proteome health to support cell homeostasis. An essential eukaryotic component of the chaperone system is Hsp90. Using a chemical-biology approach, we characterized the features driving the Hsp90 physical interactome. We found that Hsp90 associated with ∼20% of the yeast proteome using its three domains to preferentially target intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of client proteins. Hsp90 selectively utilized an IDR to regulate client activity as well as maintained IDR-protein health by preventing the transition to stress granules or P-bodies at physiological temperatures. We also discovered that Hsp90 controls the fidelity of ribosome initiation that triggers a heat shock response when disrupted. Our study provides insights into how this abundant molecular chaperone supports a dynamic and healthy native protein landscape.

Abstract: Summary
K-Ras frequently acquires gain-of-function mutations (K-RasG12D being the most common) that trigger significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes to drive tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, oncogenic K-Ras-induced dysregulation of post-transcriptional regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs) during oncogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that K-RasG12D promotes global suppression of miRNA activity, resulting in the upregulation of hundreds of targets. We constructed a comprehensive profile of physiological miRNA targets in mouse colonic epithelium and tumors expressing K-RasG12D using Halo-enhanced Argonaute pull-down. Combining this with parallel datasets of chromatin accessibility, transcriptome, and proteome, we uncovered that K-RasG12D suppressed the expression of Csnk1a1 and Csnk2a1, subsequently decreasing Ago2 phosphorylation at Ser825/829/832/835. Hypo-phosphorylated Ago2 increased binding to mRNAs while reducing its activity to repress miRNA targets. Our findings connect a potent regulatory mechanism of global miRNA activity to K-Ras in a pathophysiological context and provide a mechanistic link between oncogenic K-Ras and the post-transcriptional upregulation of miRNA targets.

Abstract: Background
Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CCLM) is the most frequent cause of death of colorectal cancer. Development of novel new effective therapy is needed for CCLM patients to improve outcome. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of recombinant methioninase (rMETase) on a CCLM orthotopic mouse model of liver metastasis established using the human colon cancer cell line HT29 expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP).
Materials and Methods
Orthotopic CCLM nude mouse models were randomized into two groups: control group (n = 6, PBS 200 µl, i.p., daily); rMETase group (n = 6, 100 units/200 µl, i.p., daily). Tumor volume was measured on day 0 and day 15. Body weight was measured twice a week. All mice were sacrificed on day 15.
Results
rMETase significantly inhibited the increase of the liver metastasis as determined by RFP fluorescence area and intensity (p = 0.016 and 0.015, respectively). There was no significant difference of body weight between either group on any day.
Conclusions
The present study suggests that rMETase has future potential therapy for CCLM in the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer that typically demonstrates resistance to chemotherapy. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are essential in tumor microenvironment (TME) regulation, including promoting chemoresistance. However, the specific TAM subset and mechanisms behind this promotion remain unclear. We employ multi-omics strategies, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), transcriptomics, multicolor immunohistochemistry (mIHC), flow cytometry, and metabolomics, to analyze chemotherapy-treated samples from both humans and mice. We identify four major TAM subsets within PDAC, among which proliferating resident macrophages (proliferating rMφs) are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. These macrophages are able to survive chemotherapy by producing more deoxycytidine (dC) and fewer dC kinases (dCKs) to decrease the absorption of gemcitabine. Moreover, proliferating rMφs promote fibrosis and immunosuppression in PDAC. Eliminating them in the transgenic mouse model alleviates fibrosis and immunosuppression, thereby re-sensitizing PDAC to chemotherapy. Consequently, targeting proliferating rMφs may become a potential treatment strategy for PDAC to enhance chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Combined inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis has been shown to activate a PP2A-dependent signaling pathway, leading to tumor cell death. Here, we analyze highly selective mitochondrial complex I or III inhibitors in vitro and in vivo to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to cell death following OXPHOS inhibition. We show that IACS-010759 treatment (complex I inhibitor) induces a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent dissociation of CIP2A from PP2A, leading to its destabilization and degradation through chaperone-mediated autophagy. Mitochondrial complex III inhibition has analogous effects. We establish that activation of the PP2A holoenzyme containing B56δ regulatory subunit selectively mediates tumor cell death, while the arrest in proliferation that is observed upon IACS-010759 treatment does not depend on the PP2A-B56δ complex. These studies provide a molecular characterization of the events subsequent to the alteration of critical bioenergetic pathways and help to refine clinical studies aimed to exploit metabolic vulnerabilities of tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Plant clock function relies on precise timing of gene expression through complex regulatory networks consisting of activators and repressors at the core of oscillators. Although TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) has been recognized as a repressor involved in shaping oscillations and regulating clock-driven processes, its potential to directly activate gene expression remains unclear. In this study, we find that OsTOC1 primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor for core clock components, including OsLHY and OsGI. Here, we show that OsTOC1 possesses the ability to directly activate the expression of circadian target genes. Through binding to the promoters of OsTGAL3a/b, transient activation of OsTOC1 induces the expression of OsTGAL3a/b, indicating its role as an activator contributing to pathogen resistance. Moreover, TOC1 participates in regulating multiple yield-related traits in rice. These findings suggest that TOC1’s function as a transcriptional repressor is not inherent, providing flexibility to circadian regulations, particularly in outputs.

Abstract: Summary
Microprocessor (MP), DROSHA-DGCR8, processes primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) to initiate miRNA biogenesis. The canonical cleavage mechanism of MP has been extensively investigated and comprehensively validated for two decades. However, this canonical mechanism cannot account for the processing of certain pri-miRNAs in animals. In this study, by conducting high-throughput pri-miRNA cleavage assays for approximately 260,000 pri-miRNA sequences, we discovered and comprehensively characterized a noncanonical cleavage mechanism of MP. This noncanonical mechanism does not need several RNA and protein elements essential for the canonical mechanism; instead, it utilizes previously unrecognized DROSHA dsRNA recognition sites (DRESs). Interestingly, the noncanonical mechanism is conserved across animals and plays a particularly significant role in C. elegans. Our established noncanonical mechanism elucidates MP cleavage in numerous RNA substrates unaccounted for by the canonical mechanism in animals. This study suggests a broader substrate repertoire of animal MPs and an expanded regulatory landscape for miRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic expression of DNMT3B is critical for establishing de novo DNA methylation. This study uncovers the mechanism through which the promoter-associated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Dnmt3bas controls the induction and alternative splicing of Dnmt3b during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Dnmt3bas recruits the PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2) at cis-regulatory elements of the Dnmt3b gene expressed at a basal level. Correspondingly, Dnmt3bas knockdown enhances Dnmt3b transcriptional induction, whereas overexpression of Dnmt3bas dampens it. Dnmt3b induction coincides with exon inclusion, switching the predominant isoform from the inactive Dnmt3b6 to the active Dnmt3b1. Intriguingly, overexpressing Dnmt3bas further enhances the Dnmt3b1:Dnmt3b6 ratio, attributed to its interaction with hnRNPL (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L), a splicing factor that promotes exon inclusion. Our data suggest that Dnmt3bas coordinates alternative splicing and transcriptional induction of Dnmt3b by facilitating the hnRNPL and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) interaction at the Dnmt3b promoter. This dual mechanism precisely regulates the expression of catalytically active DNMT3B, ensuring fidelity and specificity of de novo DNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acid metabolism is regulated according to nutrient conditions; however, the mechanism is not fully understood. Using the holometabolous insect cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) as a model, we report that hemolymph metabolites are greatly changed from the feeding larvae to the wandering larvae and to pupae. Arginine, alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and glutamate (Glu) are identified as marker metabolites of feeding larvae, wandering larvae, and pupae, respectively. Arginine level is decreased by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) regulation via repression of argininosuccinate synthetase (Ass) expression and upregulation of arginase (Arg) expression during metamorphosis. α-KG is transformed from Glu by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in larval midgut, which is repressed by 20E. The α-KG is then transformed to Glu by GDH-like in pupal fat body, which is upregulated by 20E. Thus, 20E reprogrammed amino acid metabolism during metamorphosis by regulating gene expression in a stage- and tissue-specific manner to support insect metamorphic development.

Abstract: Aim
This study aims to explore the possible effect of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) neonatal rat models and verify the possible implication of TNF-like ligand 1 A (TL1A) and NF-κB signal pathway.
Methods
NEC neonatal rat models were established through formula feeding, cold/asphyxia stress and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) gavage method. The appearance, activity and skin as well as the pathological status of rats subjected to NEC modeling were assessed. The intestinal tissues were observed after H&E staining. The expression of oxidative stress biomarkers (SOD, MDA and GSH-Px) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) were detected by ELISA and qRT-PCR. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were applied to detect expressions of TL1A and NF-κB signal pathway-related proteins. Cell apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL.
Results
NEC neonatal rat models were established successfully, in which TL1A was highly expressed and NF-κB signal pathway was activated, while TL1A and NF-κB signal pathway can be suppressed by AS-IV treatment in NEC rats. Meanwhile, inflammatory response in intestinal tissues was increased in NEC rat models and AS-IV can attenuate inflammatory response in NEC rats through inhibiting TL1A and NF-κb signal pathway.
Conclusion
AS-IV can inhibit TL1A expression and NF-κb signal pathway to attenuate the inflammatory response in NEC neonatal rat models.

Abstract: Summary
p57Kip2 is a cyclin/CDK inhibitor and a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Here, we report that p57 regulates intestinal stem cell (ISC) fate and proliferation in a CDK-independent manner during intestinal development. In the absence of p57, intestinal crypts exhibit an increased proliferation and an amplification of transit-amplifying cells and of Hopx+ ISCs, which are no longer quiescent, while Lgr5+ ISCs are unaffected. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of Hopx+ ISCs show major gene expression changes in the absence of p57. We found that p57 binds to and inhibits the activity of Ascl2, a transcription factor critical for ISC specification and maintenance, by participating in the recruitment of a corepressor complex to Ascl2 target gene promoters. Thus, our data suggest that, during intestinal development, p57 plays a key role in maintaining Hopx+ ISC quiescence and repressing the ISC phenotype outside of the crypt bottom by inhibiting the transcription factor Ascl2 in a CDK-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise benefits the human body in many ways. Irisin is secreted by muscle, increased with exercise, and conveys physiological benefits, including improved cognition and resistance to neurodegeneration. Irisin acts via αV integrins; however, a mechanistic understanding of how small polypeptides like irisin can signal through integrins is poorly understood. Using mass spectrometry and cryo-EM, we demonstrate that the extracellular heat shock protein 90α (eHsp90α) is secreted by muscle with exercise and activates integrin αVβ5. This allows for high-affinity irisin binding and signaling through an Hsp90α/αV/β5 complex. By including hydrogen/deuterium exchange data, we generate and experimentally validate a 2.98 Å RMSD irisin/αVβ5 complex docking model. Irisin binds very tightly to an alternative interface on αVβ5 distinct from that used by known ligands. These data elucidate a non-canonical mechanism by which a small polypeptide hormone like irisin can function through an integrin receptor.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA-binding ARS2 protein is centrally involved in both early RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription termination and transcript decay. Despite its essential nature, the mechanisms by which ARS2 enacts these functions have remained unclear. Here, we show that a conserved basic domain of ARS2 binds a corresponding acidic-rich, short linear motif (SLiM) in the transcription restriction factor ZC3H4. This interaction recruits ZC3H4 to chromatin to elicit RNAPII termination, independent of other early termination pathways defined by the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) and Integrator (INT) complexes. We find that ZC3H4, in turn, forms a direct connection to the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, hereby facilitating rapid degradation of the nascent RNA. Hence, ARS2 instructs the coupled transcription termination and degradation of the transcript onto which it is bound. This contrasts with ARS2 function at CPA-instructed termination sites where the protein exclusively partakes in RNA suppression via post-transcriptional decay.

Abstract: This paper reports on glycogen store in the retinal horizontal cells (HC) of the African mud catfish Clarias gariepinus, as seen by histochemical reaction with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and transmission electron microscopy in light- as well as dark-adapted state. Glycogen is abundant in the large somata and less in their axons, characterised ultrastructurally by many microtubules and extensive gap junctions interconnecting them. There was no apparent difference in glycogen content in HC somata between light- and dark adaptation, but the axons clearly showed absence of glycogen in dark condition. The HC somata (presynaptic) make synapses with dendrites in the outer plexiform layer. Müller cell inner processes, which contain more densely packed glycogen, invest the HC. Other cells of the inner nuclear layer do not show any appreciable content of glycogen. Rods, but not cones, contain abundant glycogen in their inner segments and synaptic terminals. It is likely that glycogen is used as energy substrate in hypoxia for this species that dwell muddy aquatic environment with low oxygen content. They appear to have high energy demand, and a high glycogen content in HC could act as a ready source to fulfil physiological processes, like microtubule-based transport of cargo from the large somata to axons and the maintenance of electrical activities across the gap junctions between the axonal processes. It is also likely that they can supplement glucose to the neighbouring inner nuclear layer neurons, which are clearly devoid of glycogen.

Abstract: Summary
Vibrio natriegens regulates natural competence through the TfoX and QstR transcription factors, which are involved in external DNA capture and transport. However, the extensive genetic and transcriptional regulatory basis for competency remains unknown. We used a machine-learning approach to decompose Vibrio natriegens’s transcriptome into 45 groups of independently modulated sets of genes (iModulons). Our findings show that competency is associated with the repression of two housekeeping iModulons (iron metabolism and translation) and the activation of six iModulons; including TfoX and QstR, a novel iModulon of unknown function, and three housekeeping iModulons (representing motility, polycations, and reactive oxygen species [ROS] responses). Phenotypic screening of 83 gene deletion strains demonstrates that loss of iModulon function reduces or eliminates competency. This database-iModulon-discovery cycle unveils the transcriptomic basis for competency and its relationship to housekeeping functions. These results provide the genetic basis for systems biology of competency in this organism.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding cortical function requires studying multiple scales: molecular, cellular, circuit, and behavioral. We develop a multiscale, biophysically detailed model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) with over 10,000 neurons and 30 million synapses. Neuron types, densities, spatial distributions, morphologies, biophysics, connectivity, and dendritic synapse locations are constrained by experimental data. The model includes long-range inputs from seven thalamic and cortical regions and noradrenergic inputs. Connectivity depends on cell class and cortical depth at sublaminar resolution. The model accurately predicts in vivo layer- and cell-type-specific responses (firing rates and LFP) associated with behavioral states (quiet wakefulness and movement) and experimental manipulations (noradrenaline receptor blockade and thalamus inactivation). We generate mechanistic hypotheses underlying the observed activity and analyzed low-dimensional population latent dynamics. This quantitative theoretical framework can be used to integrate and interpret M1 experimental data and sheds light on the cell-type-specific multiscale dynamics associated with several experimental conditions and behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of antiviral immunity is crucial in maintaining host immune homeostasis, a process that involves dynamic modulations of host organelles. The Golgi apparatus is increasingly perceived as a host organelle functioning as a critical platform for innate immunity, but the detailed mechanism by which it regulates antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we identify the Golgi-localized G protein-coupled receptor 108 (GPR108) as a regulator of type Ι interferon responses by targeting interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Mechanistically, GPR108 enhances the ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitylation regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1)-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of phosphorylated IRF3 for nuclear dot 10 protein 52 (NDP52)-dependent autophagic degradation, leading to suppression of antiviral immune responses against DNA or RNA viruses. Taken together, our study provides insight into the crosstalk between the Golgi apparatus and antiviral immunity via a dynamic and spatiotemporal regulation of GPR108-Smurf1 axis, thereby indicating a potential target for treating viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a brain hub regulating motivated behaviors, including social competitiveness. Mitochondrial function in the NAc links anxiety with social competitiveness, and the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) in NAc neurons regulates anxiety-related behaviors. However, it remains unexplored whether accumbal Mfn2 levels also affect social behavior and whether Mfn2 actions in the emotional and social domain are driven by distinct cell types. Here, we found that subordinate-prone highly anxious rats show decreased accumbal Mfn2 levels and that Mfn2 overexpression promotes dominant behavior. In mice, selective Mfn2 downregulation in NAc dopamine D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) induced social subordination, accompanied by decreased accumbal mitochondrial functions and decreased excitability in D2-MSNs. Instead, D1-MSN-targeted Mfn2 downregulation affected competitive ability only transiently and likely because of an increase in anxiety-like behaviors. Our results assign dissociable cell-type specific roles to Mfn2 in the NAc in modulating social dominance and anxiety.

Abstract: Summary
The annotation of microRNAs depends on the availability of transcriptomics data and expert knowledge. This has led to a gap between the availability of novel genomes and high-quality microRNA complements. Using >16,000 microRNAs from the manually curated microRNA gene database MirGeneDB, we generated trained covariance models for all conserved microRNA families. These models are available in our tool MirMachine, which annotates conserved microRNAs within genomes. We successfully applied MirMachine to a range of animal species, including those with large genomes and genome duplications and extinct species, where small RNA sequencing is hard to achieve. We further describe a microRNA score of expected microRNAs that can be used to assess the completeness of genome assemblies. MirMachine closes a long-persisting gap in the microRNA field by facilitating automated genome annotation pipelines and deeper studies into the evolution of genome regulation, even in extinct organisms.

Abstract: Summary
To build therapeutic strains, Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) have been engineered to express antibiotics, toxin-degrading enzymes, immunoregulators, and anti-cancer chemotherapies. For efficacy, the recombinant genes need to be highly expressed, but this imposes a burden on the cell, and plasmids are difficult to maintain in the body. To address these problems, we have developed landing pads in the EcN genome and genetic circuits to control therapeutic gene expression. These tools were applied to EcN SYNB1618, undergoing clinical trials as a phenylketonuria treatment. The pathway for converting phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid was moved to a landing pad under the control of a circuit that keeps the pathway off during storage. The resulting strain (EcN SYN8784) achieved higher activity than EcN SYNB1618, reaching levels near when the pathway is carried on a plasmid. This work demonstrates a simple system for engineering EcN that aids quantitative strain design for therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is implicated in cancer progression. However, the impact of m6A on the antitumor effects of radiotherapy and the related mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that ionizing radiation (IR) induces immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) expansion and YTHDF2 expression in both murine models and humans. Following IR, loss of Ythdf2 in myeloid cells augments antitumor immunity and overcomes tumor radioresistance by altering MDSC differentiation and inhibiting MDSC infiltration and suppressive function. The remodeling of the landscape of MDSC populations by local IR is reversed by Ythdf2 deficiency. IR-induced YTHDF2 expression relies on NF-κB signaling; YTHDF2 in turn leads to NF-κB activation by directly binding and degrading transcripts encoding negative regulators of NF-κB signaling, resulting in an IR-YTHDF2-NF-κB circuit. Pharmacological inhibition of YTHDF2 overcomes MDSC-induced immunosuppression and improves combined IR and/or anti-PD-L1 treatment. Thus, YTHDF2 is a promising target to improve radiotherapy (RT) and RT/immunotherapy combinations.

Abstract: Summary
Pioneer transcription factors interact with nucleosomes to scan silent, compact chromatin, enabling cooperative events that modulate gene activity. While at a subset of sites pioneer factors access chromatin by assisted loading with other transcription factors, the nucleosome-binding properties of pioneer factors enable them to initiate zygotic genome activation, embryonic development, and cellular reprogramming. To better understand nucleosome targeting in vivo, we assess whether pioneer factors FoxA1 and Sox2 target stable or unstable nucleosomes and find that they target DNase-resistant, stable nucleosomes, whereas HNF4A, a non-nucleosome binding factor, targets open, DNase-sensitive chromatin. Despite FOXA1 and SOX2 targeting similar proportions of DNase-resistant chromatin, using single-molecule tracking, we find that FOXA1 uses lower nucleoplasmic diffusion and longer residence times while SOX2 uses higher nucleoplasmic diffusion and shorter residence times to scan compact chromatin, while HNF4 scans compact chromatin much less efficiently. Thus, pioneer factors target compact chromatin through distinct processes.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin hypersecretion followed by reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Here we show that acute stimulation of pancreatic islets with the insulin secretagogue dextrorphan (DXO) or glibenclamide enhances GSIS, whereas chronic treatment with high concentrations of these drugs reduce GSIS but protect islets from cell death. Bulk RNA sequencing of islets shows increased expression of genes for serine-linked mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism (OCM) after chronic, but not acute, stimulation. In chronically stimulated islets, more glucose is metabolized to serine than to citrate, and the mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio decreases, whereas the NADPH/NADP+ ratio increases. Activating transcription factor-4 (Atf4) is required and sufficient to activate serine-linked mitochondrial OCM genes in islets, with gain- and loss-of-function experiments showing that Atf4 reduces GSIS and is required, but not sufficient, for full DXO-mediated islet protection. In sum, we identify a reversible metabolic pathway that provides islet protection at the expense of secretory function.

Abstract: Summary
The redox regulator NRF2 becomes activated upon oxidative and electrophilic stress and orchestrates a response program associated with redox regulation, metabolism, tumor therapy resistance, and immune suppression. Here, we describe an unrecognized link between the integrated stress response (ISR) and NRF2 mediated by the ISR effector ATF4. The ISR is commonly activated after starvation or ER stress and plays a central role in tissue homeostasis and cancer plasticity. ATF4 increases NRF2 transcription and induces the glutathione-degrading enzyme CHAC1, which we now show to be critically important for maintaining NRF2 activation. In-depth analyses reveal that NRF2 supports ATF4-induced cells by increasing cystine uptake via the glutamate-cystine antiporter xCT. In addition, NRF2 upregulates genes mediating thioredoxin usage and regeneration, thus balancing the glutathione decrease. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the NRF2 response serves as second layer of the ISR, an observation highly relevant for the understanding of cellular resilience in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
The two non-visual arrestins, arrestin2 and arrestin3, bind hundreds of GPCRs with different phosphorylation patterns, leading to distinct functional outcomes. Structural information on these interactions is available only for very few GPCRs. Here, we have characterized the interactions between the phosphorylated human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and arrestin2. We identified several new CCR5 phosphorylation sites necessary for stable arrestin2 complex formation. Structures of arrestin2 in the apo form and complexes with CCR5 C-terminal phosphopeptides, together with NMR, biochemical, and functional assays, revealed three phosphoresidues in a pXpp motif that are essential for arrestin2 binding and activation. The identified motif appears responsible for robust arrestin2 recruitment in many other GPCRs. An analysis of receptor sequences and available structural and functional information provides hints on the molecular basis of arrestin2/arrestin3 isoform specificity. Our findings demonstrate how multi-site phosphorylation controls GPCR⋅arrestin interactions and provide a framework to probe the intricate details of arrestin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Type V CRISPR-associated systems (Cas)12 family nucleases are considered to have evolved from transposon-associated TnpB, and several of these nucleases have been engineered as versatile genome editors. Despite the conserved RNA-guided DNA-cleaving functionality, these Cas12 nucleases differ markedly from the currently identified ancestor TnpB in aspects such as guide RNA origination, effector complex composition, and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) specificity, suggesting the presence of earlier evolutionary intermediates that could be mined to develop advanced genome manipulation biotechnologies. Using evolutionary and biochemical analyses, we identify that the miniature type V-U4 nuclease (referred to as Cas12n, 400–700 amino acids) is likely the earliest evolutionary intermediate between TnpB and large type V CRISPR systems. We demonstrate that with the exception of CRISPR array emergence, CRISPR-Cas12n shares several similar characteristics with TnpB-ωRNA, including a miniature and likely monomeric nuclease for DNA targeting, origination of guide RNA from nuclease coding sequence, and generation of a small sticky end following DNA cleavage. Cas12n nucleases recognize a unique 5′-AAN PAM sequence, of which the A nucleotide at the −2 position is also required for TnpB. Moreover, we demonstrate the robust genome-editing capacity of Cas12n in bacteria and engineer a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas12n (termed Cas12Pro) with up to 80% indel efficiency in human cells. The engineered Cas12Pro enables base editing in human cells. Our results further expand the understanding regarding type V CRISPR evolutionary mechanisms and enrich the miniature CRISPR toolbox for therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Background
The endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 alpha-X-box binding protein-1 (IRE1α-XBP1), has been considered as a critical factor of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) in proliferation and osteogenesis. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of XBP1s, which was cleaved by IRE1α on the proliferation and osteogenesis of hPDLCs.
Methods
ERS model was induced by tunicamycin (TM); cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay; pLVX-XBP1s-hPDLCs cell line was established by lentivirus infaction; expression of ERS-related protein including eIF2α, GRP78, ATF4 and XBP1s, autophagy-related P62 and LC3, and apoptosis-related Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 were detected by Western Blot; expression of osteogenic genes was detected by RT-qPCR, and senescence of hPDLCs was explored by β-galactosidase staining. Furthermore, the interaction between XBP1s and human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) was examined by immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT).
Results
The results showed an increase in proliferation of hPDLCs from 0 to 24 h when ERS was induced by TM treatment (P < 0.05). XBP1s overexpression induced hPDLCs proliferation, upgraded autophagy and degraded apoptosis significantly (P < 0.05). In pLVX-XBP1s-hPDLCs, the ratio of senescent cells was markedly decreased after several passages (P < 0.05); After infection with pLVX-BMP2 lentiviral supernatant, IFAT result showed that XBP1s and BMP2 well co-located in the cytoplasm of pLVX-XBP1s-hPDLCs and PERK-ATF4 ERS branch was activated, meanwhile, there were obviously more mineralized nodules and mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related genes was continually up-regulated (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
XBP1s promotes the proliferation via regulating the autophagy and apoptosis, and enhances expression of osteogenic genes in hPDLCs. The mechanisms in this regard need exploring further for periodontal tissue regeneration, functionalization and clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Cell migration through 3D environments is essential to development, disease, and regeneration processes. Conceptual models of migration have been developed primarily on the basis of 2D cell behaviors, but a general understanding of 3D cell migration is still lacking due to the added complexity of the extracellular matrix. Here, using a multiplexed biophysical imaging approach for single-cell analysis of human cell lines, we show how the subprocesses of adhesion, contractility, actin cytoskeletal dynamics, and matrix remodeling integrate to produce heterogeneous migration behaviors. This single-cell analysis identifies three modes of cell speed and persistence coupling, driven by distinct modes of coordination between matrix remodeling and protrusive activity. The framework that emerges establishes a predictive model linking cell trajectories to distinct subprocess coordination states.

Abstract: Summary
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates Th17-polarized CD4+ T cell functions, but its role in HIV-1 replication/outgrowth remains unknown. Genetic (CRISPR-Cas9) and pharmacological inhibition reveal AhR as a barrier to HIV-1 replication in T cell receptor (TCR)-activated CD4+ T cells in vitro. In single-round vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 infection, AhR blockade increases the efficacy of early/late reverse transcription and subsequently facilitated integration/translation. Moreover, AhR blockade boosts viral outgrowth in CD4+ T cells of people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Finally, RNA sequencing reveals genes/pathways downregulated by AhR blockade in CD4+ T cells of ART-treated PLWH, including HIV-1 interactors and gut-homing molecules with AhR-responsive elements in their promoters. Among them, HIC1, a repressor of Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcription and a tissue-residency master regulator, is identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation as a direct AhR target. Thus, AhR governs a T cell transcriptional program controlling viral replication/outgrowth and tissue residency/recirculation, supporting the use of AhR inhibitors in “shock and kill” HIV-1 remission/cure strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for describing cell states. Identifying the spatial arrangement of these states in tissues remains challenging, with the existing methods requiring niche methodologies and expertise. Here, we describe segmentation by exogenous perfusion (SEEP), a rapid and integrated method to link surface proximity and environment accessibility to transcriptional identity within three-dimensional (3D) disease models. The method utilizes the steady-state diffusion kinetics of a fluorescent dye to establish a gradient along the radial axis of disease models. Classification of sample layers based on dye accessibility enables dissociated and sorted cells to be characterized by transcriptomic and regional identities. Using SEEP, we analyze spheroid, organoid, and in vivo tumor models of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). The results validate long-standing beliefs about the relationship between cell state and position while revealing new concepts regarding how spatially unique microenvironments influence the identity of individual cells within tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Drugs targeting genes linked to disease via evidence from human genetics have increased odds of approval. Approaches to prioritize such genes include genome-wide association studies (GWASs), rare variant burden tests in exome sequencing studies (Exome), or integration of a GWAS with expression/protein quantitative trait loci (eQTL/pQTL-GWAS). Here, we compare gene-prioritization approaches on 30 clinically relevant traits and benchmark their ability to recover drug targets. Across traits, prioritized genes were enriched for drug targets with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.17, 2.04, 1.81, and 1.31 for the GWAS, eQTL-GWAS, Exome, and pQTL-GWAS methods, respectively. Adjusting for differences in testable genes and sample sizes, GWAS outperforms e/pQTL-GWAS, but not the Exome approach. Furthermore, performance increased through gene network diffusion, although the node degree, being the best predictor (OR = 8.7), revealed strong bias in literature-curated networks. In conclusion, we systematically assessed strategies to prioritize drug target genes, highlighting the promises and pitfalls of current approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease with a limited set of known driver mutations but considerable cancer cell heterogeneity. Phosphoproteomics provides a readout of aberrant signaling and has the potential to identify new targets and guide treatment decisions. Using two-step sequential phosphopeptide enrichment, we generate a comprehensive phosphoproteome and proteome of nine PDAC cell lines, encompassing more than 20,000 phosphosites on 5,763 phospho-proteins, including 316 protein kinases. By using integrative inferred kinase activity (INKA) scoring, we identify multiple (parallel) activated kinases that are subsequently matched to kinase inhibitors. Compared with high-dose single-drug treatments, INKA-tailored low-dose 3-drug combinations against multiple targets demonstrate superior efficacy against PDAC cell lines, organoid cultures, and patient-derived xenografts. Overall, this approach is particularly more effective against the aggressive mesenchymal PDAC model compared with the epithelial model in both preclinical settings and may contribute to improved treatment outcomes in PDAC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic inflammation is established as part of late-stage severe lung disease, but molecular, functional, and phenotypic changes in peripheral immune cells in early disease stages remain ill defined. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major respiratory disease characterized by small-airway inflammation, emphysema, and severe breathing difficulties. Using single-cell analyses we demonstrate that blood neutrophils are already increased in early-stage COPD, and changes in molecular and functional neutrophil states correlate with lung function decline. Assessing neutrophils and their bone marrow precursors in a murine cigarette smoke exposure model identified similar molecular changes in blood neutrophils and precursor populations that also occur in the blood and lung. Our study shows that systemic molecular alterations in neutrophils and their precursors are part of early-stage COPD, a finding to be further explored for potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for early diagnosis and patient stratification.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cell plasticity enables cell survival in harsh physiological environments and fate transitions such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that underlies invasion and metastasis. Using genome-wide transcriptomic and translatomic studies, an alternate mechanism of cap-dependent mRNA translation by the DAP5/eIF3d complex is shown to be essential for metastasis, EMT, and tumor directed angiogenesis. DAP5/eIF3d carries out selective translation of mRNAs encoding EMT transcription factors and regulators, cell migration integrins, metalloproteinases, and cell survival and angiogenesis factors. DAP5 is overexpressed in metastatic human breast cancers associated with poor metastasis-free survival. In human and murine breast cancer animal models, DAP5 is not required for primary tumor growth but is essential for EMT, cell migration, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and resistance to anoikis. Thus, cancer cell mRNA translation involves two cap-dependent mRNA translation mechanisms, eIF4E/mTORC1 and DAP5/eIF3d. These findings highlight a surprising level of plasticity in mRNA translation during cancer progression and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke prevalence varies by sex and ancestry, possibly due to genetic heterogeneity between subgroups. We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of 16 biobanks across multiple ancestries to study the genetics of ischemic stroke (60,176 cases, 1,310,725 controls) as part of the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI) and further combined the results with previously published MegaStroke. Five novel loci for ischemic stroke (LAMC1, CALCRL, PLSCR1, CDKN1A, and SWAP70) were identified after replication in four additional datasets. One previously reported locus showed significant ancestry heterogeneity (ABO), and one showed significant sex heterogeneity (ALDH2). The ALDH2 association was male specific (males p = 1.67e−24, females p = 0.126) and was additionally observed only in the East Asian ancestry (male) samples. These findings emphasize the need for more diverse datasets with large sample sizes to further understand the genetic predisposition of stroke in different ancestry and sex groups.

Abstract: Summary
The cell-autonomous balance of immune-inhibitory and -stimulatory signals is a critical process in cancer immune evasion. Using patient-derived co-cultures, humanized mouse models, and single-cell RNA-sequencing of patient melanomas biopsied before and on immune checkpoint blockade, we find that intact cancer cell-intrinsic expression of CD58 and ligation to CD2 is required for anti-tumor immunity and is predictive of treatment response. Defects in this axis promote immune evasion through diminished T cell activation, impaired intratumoral T cell infiltration and proliferation, and concurrently increased PD-L1 protein stabilization. Through CRISPR-Cas9 and proteomics screens, we identify and validate CMTM6 as critical for CD58 stability and upregulation of PD-L1 upon CD58 loss. Competition between CD58 and PD-L1 for CMTM6 binding determines their rate of endosomal recycling over lysosomal degradation. Overall, we describe an underappreciated yet critical axis of cancer immunity and provide a molecular basis for how cancer cells balance immune inhibitory and stimulatory cues.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remodels the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form replication organelles, leading to ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the role of specific UPR pathways in infection remains unclear. Here, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes marginal activation of signaling sensor IRE1α leading to its phosphorylation, clustering in the form of dense ER-membrane rearrangements with embedded membrane openings, and XBP1 splicing. By investigating the factors regulated by IRE1α-XBP1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified stress-activated kinase NUAK2 as a novel host-dependency factor for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and MERS-CoV entry. Reducing NUAK2 abundance or kinase activity impaired SARS-CoV-2 particle binding and internalization by decreasing cell surface levels of viral receptors and viral trafficking likely by modulating the actin cytoskeleton. IRE1α-dependent NUAK2 levels were elevated in SARS-CoV-2-infected and bystander non-infected cells, promoting viral spread by maintaining ACE2 cell surface levels and facilitating virion binding to bystander cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac resident macrophages play vital roles in heart development, homeostasis, repair, and regeneration. Recent studies documented the hematopoietic potential of cardiac endothelium that supports the generation of cardiac macrophages and peripheral blood cells in mice. However, the conclusion was not strongly supported by previous genetic tracing studies, given the non-specific nature of conventional Cre-loxP tracing tools. Here, we develop an intercellular genetic labeling system that can permanently trace heart-specific endothelial cells based on cell-cell interaction in mice. Results from cell-cell contact-mediated genetic fate mapping demonstrate that cardiac endothelial cells do not exhibit hemogenic potential and do not contribute to cardiac macrophages or other circulating blood cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cajal-Retzius cells (CRs) are key players in cerebral cortex development, and they display a unique transcriptomic identity. Here, we use scRNA-seq to reconstruct the differentiation trajectory of mouse hem-derived CRs, and we unravel the transient expression of a complete gene module previously known to control multiciliogenesis. However, CRs do not undergo centriole amplification or multiciliation. Upon deletion of Gmnc, the master regulator of multiciliogenesis, CRs are initially produced but fail to reach their normal identity resulting in their massive apoptosis. We further dissect the contribution of multiciliation effector genes and identify Trp73 as a key determinant. Finally, we use in utero electroporation to demonstrate that the intrinsic competence of hem progenitors as well as the heterochronic expression of Gmnc prevent centriole amplification in the CR lineage. Our work exemplifies how the co-option of a complete gene module, repurposed to control a distinct process, may contribute to the emergence of novel cell identities.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in lymphocyte production patterns occurring across human ontogeny remain poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that human lymphopoiesis is supported by three waves of embryonic, fetal, and postnatal multi-lymphoid progenitors (MLPs) differing in CD7 and CD10 expression and their output of CD127−/+ early lymphoid progenitors (ELPs). In addition, our results reveal that, like the fetal-to-adult switch in erythropoiesis, transition to postnatal life coincides with a shift from multilineage to B lineage-biased lymphopoiesis and an increase in production of CD127+ ELPs, which persists until puberty. A further developmental transition is observed in elderly individuals whereby B cell differentiation bypasses the CD127+ compartment and branches directly from CD10+ MLPs. Functional analyses indicate that these changes are determined at the level of hematopoietic stem cells. These findings provide insights for understanding identity and function of human MLPs and the establishment and maintenance of adaptative immunity.

Abstract: The paratympanic organ (PTO) is a small sense organ in the middle ear of birds that contains hair cells similar to those found in vestibuloauditory organs and receives afferent fibers from the geniculate ganglion. To consider the histochemical similarities between the PTO and vestibular hair cells, we examined the expression patterns of representative molecules in vestibular hair cells, including prosaposin, G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 37 and GPR37L1 as prosaposin receptors, vesicular glutamate transporter (vGluT) 2 and vGluT3, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit α9 (nAChRα9), and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and GAD67, in the postnatal day 0 chick PTO and geniculate ganglion by in situ hybridization. Prosaposin mRNA was observed in PTO hair cells, supporting cells, and geniculate ganglion cells. vGluT3 mRNA was observed in PTO hair cells, whereas vGluT2 was observed in a small number of ganglion cells. nAChRα9 mRNA was observed in a small number of PTO hair cells. The results suggest that the histochemical character of PTO hair cells is more similar to that of vestibular hair cells than that of auditory hair cells in chicks.

Abstract: Summary
A major cause of intestinal failure (IF) is intestinal epithelium necrosis and massive loss of enterocytes, especially in the jejunum, the major intestinal segment in charge of nutrient absorption. However, mechanisms underlying jejunal epithelial regeneration after extensive loss of enterocytes remain elusive. Here, we apply a genetic ablation system to induce extensive damage to jejunal enterocytes in zebrafish, mimicking the jejunal epithelium necrosis that causes IF. In response to injury, proliferation and filopodia/lamellipodia drive anterior migration of the ileal enterocytes into the injured jejunum. The migrated fabp6+ ileal enterocytes transdifferentiate into fabp2+ jejunal enterocytes to fulfill the regeneration, consisting of dedifferentiation to precursor status followed by redifferentiation. The dedifferentiation is activated by the IL1β-NFκB axis, whose agonist promotes regeneration. Extensive jejunal epithelial damage is repaired by the migration and transdifferentiation of ileal enterocytes, revealing an intersegmental migration mechanism of intestinal regeneration and providing potential therapeutic targets for IF caused by jejunal epithelium necrosis.

Abstract: Various therapeutic approaches are conducted for regression of liver fibrosis and prevent possible further carcinogenic transformation. This study was aimed to assess the prospective therapeutic potential of bromelain against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis using in-vitro and in vivo approaches. In vitro study, HSC-T6 cell line was used to evaluate the effect of bromelain on HSC-T6 cell viability and apoptosis. In vivo, Rats were treated by TAA for 6 weeks for induction of hepatic fibrosis followed by post treatment by different doses of bromelain and silymarin for further 4 weeks to assess the regression of hepatic fibrosis. The in-vitro findings indicated that bromelain hindered the proliferation of HSCs in concentration dependent manner compared with the untreated cells. The in vivo study revealed that treatment of TAA fibrotic rats with different doses of bromelain and silymarin induced a significant restoration in liver function biomarkers, attenuation of oxidative stress, upregulation of total antioxidant capacity and thereby decline of fibrotic biomarkers and improving histopathological and immunohistochemical changes. In conclusion, This study indicates that bromelain can regress TAA induced hepatic fibrosis in rats via inhibiting HSCs activation, α-SMA expression and the ECM deposition in hepatic tissue in addition to its antioxidants pathway, these findings prove the promising therapeutic potential of bromelain as a novel therapeutic approach for chronic hepatic fibrotic diseases.

Abstract: The cell wall fulfils several functions in the biology of fungi. For instance, it provides mechanical strength, interacts with the (a)biotic environment, and acts as a molecular sieve. Recently, it was shown that proteins and β-glucans in the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune bind Cu2+. We here show that the cell wall of this mushroom forming fungus also binds other (micro-)nutrients. Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, NO3–, PO43-, and SO42- bound at levels > 1 mg per gram dry weight cell wall, while binding of BO3-, Cu2+, Zn2+ and MoO42- was lower. Sorption of Ca2+, Mn2+, Zn2+ and PO43- was promoted at alkaline pH. These compounds as well as BO33-, Cu2+, Mg2+, NO3–, and SO42- that had bound at pH 4, 6, or 8 could be released from the cell wall at pH 4 with a maximum efficiency of 46–93 %. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy showed that the metals had the same binding sites as Cu2+ when a low concentration of this ion is used. Moreover, data indicate that anions bind to the cell wall as well as to the metal ions. Together, it is shown that the cell wall of S. commune binds various (micro-)nutrients and that this binding is higher than the uptake by hyphae. The binding to the cell wall may be used as a storage mechanism or may reduce availability of these molecules to competitors or prevent toxic influx in the cytoplasm.

Abstract: Tissues such as the intestine harbor stem cells that have remarkable functional plasticity in response to a dynamic environment. To adapt to the environment, stem cells constantly receive information from their surrounding microenvironment (also called the ‘niche’) that instructs them how to adapt to changes. The Drosophila midgut shows morphological and functional similarities to the mammalian small intestine and has been a useful model system to study signaling events in stem cells and tissue homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the Drosophila midgut regarding how stem cells communicate with microenvironmental niches including enteroblasts, enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells and visceral muscles to coordinate tissue regeneration and homeostasis. In addition, distant cells such as hemocytes or tracheal cells have been shown to interact with stem cells and influence the development of intestinal diseases. We discuss the contribution of stem cell niches in driving or counteracting disease progression, and review conceptual advances derived from the Drosophila intestine as a model for stem cell biology.

Abstract: Summary
During chronic viral infection and cancer, it has been established that a subset of progenitor CD8+ T cells continuously gives rise to terminally exhausted cells and cytotoxic effector cells. Although multiple transcriptional programs governing the bifurcated differentiation trajectories have been previously studied, little is known about the chromatin structure changes regulating CD8+ T cell-fate decision. In this study, we demonstrate that the chromatin remodeling complex PBAF restrains expansion and promotes exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infection and cancer. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses reveal the role of PBAF in maintaining chromatin accessibility of multiple genetic pathways and transcriptional programs to restrain proliferation and promote T cell exhaustion. Harnessing this knowledge, we demonstrate that perturbation of PBAF complex constrained exhaustion and promoted expansion of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells resulting in antitumor immunity in a preclinical melanoma model, implicating PBAF as an attractive target for cancer immunotherapeutic.

Abstract: Summary
Most marine organisms have a biphasic life cycle during which pelagic larvae transform into radically different juveniles. In vertebrates, the role of thyroid hormones (THs) in triggering this transition is well known, but how the morphological and physiological changes are integrated in a coherent way with the ecological transition remains poorly explored. To gain insight into this question, we performed an integrated analysis of metamorphosis of a marine teleost, the false clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris). We show how THs coordinate a change in color vision as well as a major metabolic shift in energy production, highlighting how it orchestrates this transformation. By manipulating the activity of liver X regulator (LXR), a major regulator of metabolism, we also identify a tight link between metabolic changes and metamorphosis progression. Strikingly, we observed that these regulations are at play in the wild, explaining how hormones coordinate energy needs with available resources during the life cycle.

Abstract: Summary
We applied raw human liver microsome lysate to a holey carbon grid and used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define its composition. From this sample we identified and simultaneously determined high-resolution structural information for ten unique human liver enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes. Notably, we determined the structure of the endoplasmic bifunctional protein H6PD, where the N- and C-terminal domains independently possess glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase enzymatic activity, respectively. We also obtained the structure of heterodimeric human GANAB, an ER glycoprotein quality-control machinery that contains a catalytic α subunit and a noncatalytic β subunit. In addition, we observed a decameric peroxidase, PRDX4, which directly contacts a disulfide isomerase-related protein, ERp46. Structural data suggest that several glycosylations, bound endogenous compounds, and ions associate with these human liver enzymes. These results highlight the importance of cryo-EM in facilitating the elucidation of human organ proteomics at the atomic level.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα (PI4KIIα) generates essential phospholipids and is a cargo for endosomal adaptor proteins. Activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) is the dominant synaptic vesicle endocytosis mode during high neuronal activity and is sustained by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity. We reveal the GSK3β substrate PI4KIIα is essential for ADBE via its depletion in primary neuronal cultures. Kinase-dead PI4KIIα rescues ADBE in these neurons but not a phosphomimetic form mutated at the GSK3β site, Ser-47. Ser-47 phosphomimetic peptides inhibit ADBE in a dominant-negative manner, confirming that Ser-47 phosphorylation is essential for ADBE. Phosphomimetic PI4KIIα interacts with a specific cohort of presynaptic molecules, two of which, AGAP2 and CAMKV, are also essential for ADBE when depleted in neurons. Thus, PI4KIIα is a GSK3β-dependent interaction hub that silos essential ADBE molecules for liberation during neuronal activity.

Abstract: Summary
Various culture conditions by small molecules have been explored to extend pluripotency of stem cells, but their impacts on cell fate in vivo remain elusive. We systematically compared the effects of various culture conditions on the pluripotency and cell fate in vivo of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by tetraploid embryo complementation assay. Conventional ESC cultures in serum/LIF-based condition produced complete ESC mice and also the survival to adulthood at the highest rates of all other chemical-based cultures. Moreover, long-term examination of the survived ESC mice demonstrated that conventional ESC cultures did not lead to visible abnormality for up to 1.5–2 years, whereas the prolonged chemical-based cultures developed retroperitoneal atypical teratomas or leiomyomas. The chemical-based cultures exhibited transcriptomes and epigenomes that typically differed from those of conventional ESC cultures. Our results warrant further refinement of culture conditions in promoting the pluripotency and safety of ESCs in future applications.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the mechanisms by which immune cells become dysfunctional in tumors is critical to developing next-generation immunotherapies. We profiled proteomes of cancer tissue as well as monocyte/macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and NK cells isolated from tumors, liver, and blood of 48 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that tumor macrophages induce the sphingosine-1-phospate-degrading enzyme SGPL1, which dampened their inflammatory phenotype and anti-tumor function in vivo. We further discovered that the signaling scaffold protein AFAP1L2, typically only found in activated NK cells, is also upregulated in chronically stimulated CD8+ T cells in tumors. Ablation of AFAP1L2 in CD8+ T cells increased their viability upon repeated stimulation and enhanced their anti-tumor activity synergistically with PD-L1 blockade in mouse models. Our data reveal new targets for immunotherapy and provide a resource on immune cell proteomes in liver cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional regulation of secondary cell wall (SCW) formation is strictly controlled by a complex network of transcription factors in vascular plants and has been shown to be mediated by a group of NAC master switches. In this study, we show that in a bHLH transcription factor, OsbHLH002/OsICE1, its loss-of-function mutant displays a lodging phenotype. Further results show that OsbHLH002 and Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1) interact and share a set of common targets. In addition, the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1, rice ortholog of KNOTTED ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA7, and OsNAC31 interact with OsbHLH002 and OSH1 and regulate their binding capacity on OsMYB61, a key regulatory factor in SCW development. Collectively, our results indicate OsbHLH002 and OSH1 as key regulators in SCW formation and shed light on molecular mechanisms of how active and repressive factors precisely orchestrate SCW synthesis in rice, which may provide a strategy for manipulating plant biomass production.

Abstract: Summary
Although treatment with taxanes does not always lead to clinical benefit, all patients are at risk of their detrimental side effects such as peripheral neuropathy. Understanding the in vivo mode of action of taxanes can help design improved treatment regimens. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo, taxanes directly trigger T cells to selectively kill cancer cells in a non-canonical, T cell receptor-independent manner. Mechanistically, taxanes induce T cells to release cytotoxic extracellular vesicles, which lead to apoptosis specifically in tumor cells while leaving healthy epithelial cells intact. We exploit these findings to develop an effective therapeutic approach, based on transfer of T cells pre-treated with taxanes ex vivo, thereby avoiding toxicity of systemic treatment. Our study reveals a different in vivo mode of action of one of the most commonly used chemotherapies, and opens avenues to harness T cell-dependent anti-tumor effects of taxanes while avoiding systemic toxicity.

Abstract: Mongolian medicine prescriptions are recognized as promising gastroprotective agents. This study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of Liuwei Anxiao San (LAS) in gastric ulcer (GU). GU rat models were established using acetic acid, followed by treatment with LAS at different doses and/or the JAK2 agonist Coumermycin A1 (CA1). The ulcerous area and inhibition rates were calculated. The mucosal damage and cell apoptosis in gastric tissues were assessed by H&E and TUNEL staining. The activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT, and MDA levels were measured. The levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors were determined by ELISA. The activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was determined by Western blot. As the results suggested, LAS dose-dependently ameliorated gastric mucosal damage and inhibited oxidative stress and inflammatory response, evidenced by increased activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT, decreased MDA level, increment of anti-inflammatory factors and decrement of pro-inflammatory factors, and inhibited the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in GU rats. CA1 partly abolished the function of LAS on gastric mucosal injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation in GU rats. In conclusion, LAS protects against gastric mucosal injury in GU rats through inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation by suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining a highly acidic lysosomal pH is central to cellular physiology. Here, we use functional proteomics, single-particle cryo-EM, electrophysiology, and in vivo imaging to unravel a key biological function of human lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) in regulating lysosomal pH homeostasis. Despite being widely used as a lysosomal marker, the physiological functions of the LAMP proteins have long been overlooked. We show that LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 directly interact with and inhibit the activity of the lysosomal cation channel TMEM175, a key player in lysosomal pH homeostasis implicated in Parkinson’s disease. This LAMP inhibition mitigates the proton conduction of TMEM175 and facilitates lysosomal acidification to a lower pH environment crucial for optimal hydrolase activity. Disrupting the LAMP-TMEM175 interaction alkalinizes the lysosomal pH and compromises the lysosomal hydrolytic function. In light of the ever-increasing importance of lysosomes to cellular physiology and diseases, our data have widespread implications for lysosomal biology.

Abstract: R-loops are regulators of many cellular processes and are threats to genome integrity. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the regulation of R-loops is important. Inspired by the findings on RNase H1-mediated R-loop degradation or accumulation, we focused our interest on the regulation of RNase H1 expression. In the present study, we report that G9a positively regulates RNase H1 expression to boost R-loop degradation. CHCHD2 acts as a repressive transcription factor that inhibits the expression of RNase H1 to promote R-loop accumulation. Sirt1 interacts with CHCHD2 and deacetylates it, which functions as a corepressor that suppresses the expression of downstream target gene RNase H1. We also found that G9a methylated the promoter of RNase H1, inhibiting the binding of CHCHD2 and Sirt1. In contrast, when G9a was knocked down, recruitment of CHCHD2 and Sirt1 to the RNase H1 promoter increased, which co-inhibited RNase H1 transcription. Furthermore, knockdown of Sirt1 led to binding of G9a to the RNase H1 promoter. In summary, we demonstrated that G9a regulates RNase H1 expression to maintain the steady-state balance of R-loops by suppressing the recruitment of CHCHD2/Sirt1 corepressors to the target gene promoter.

Abstract: Summary
Localized translation is vital to polarized cells and requires precise and robust distribution of different mRNAs and ribosomes across the cell. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and important players are lacking. Here, we discovered a Rab5 effector, the five-subunit endosomal Rab5 and RNA/ribosome intermediary (FERRY) complex, that recruits mRNAs and ribosomes to early endosomes through direct mRNA-interaction. FERRY displays preferential binding to certain groups of transcripts, including mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins. Deletion of FERRY subunits reduces the endosomal localization of transcripts in cells and has a significant impact on mRNA levels. Clinical studies show that genetic disruption of FERRY causes severe brain damage. We found that, in neurons, FERRY co-localizes with mRNA on early endosomes, and mRNA loaded FERRY-positive endosomes are in close proximity of mitochondria. FERRY thus transforms endosomes into mRNA carriers and plays a key role in regulating mRNA distribution and transport.

Abstract: Linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex composed of HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN that catalyzes the formation of linear/M1-linked ubiquitin chain. It has been shown to play a pivotal role in the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling induced by proinflammatory stimuli. Here, we found that tumor susceptibility gene (TSG101) physically interacts with HOIP, a catalytic component of LUBAC, and potentiates LUBAC activity. Depletion of TSG101 expression by RNA interference decreased TNFα-induced linear ubiquitination and the formation of TNFα receptor 1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC). Furthermore, TSG101 facilitated the TNFα-induced stimulation of the NF-κB pathway. Thus, we suggest that TSG101 functions as a positive modulator of HOIP that mediates TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling pathway.
