Abstract: Summary
Conspecific recognition and discrimination is a vital aspect of social interactions. Genetic manipulations have implicated the CA2 sub-field and ventral hippocampus in rodent social memory. However, little is known about the nature of hippocampal responses to social signals. We characterized ventral CA1 responses in rats while interacting with conspecifics across a gap. Many cells showed unusual “social presence responses,” i.e., large elevations of firing rates, which were contingent on the presence of a conspecific. Sharp-wave ripple activity was also increased by conspecific presence. The cells were modulated by facial touch and ultrasonic vocalizations. In male rats, female conspecifics evoked stronger responses than males. In addition, responses to females differed more strongly between individual females than between males. Cells showed little response to object presence. Ventral CA1 responses were also markedly different from those of dorsal CA1, where most cells were weakly inhibited by conspecific presence.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue morphogenesis is strikingly robust. Yet, how tissues are sculpted under challenging conditions is unknown. Here, we combined network analysis, experimental perturbations, and computational modeling to determine how network connectivity between hundreds of contractile cells on the ventral side of the Drosophila embryo ensures robust tissue folding. We identified two network properties that mechanically promote robustness. First, redundant supracellular cytoskeletal network paths ensure global connectivity, even with network degradation. By forming many more connections than are required, morphogenesis is not disrupted by local network damage, analogous to the way redundancy guarantees the large-scale function of vasculature and transportation networks. Second, directional stiffening of edges oriented orthogonal to the folding axis promotes furrow formation at lower contractility levels. Structural redundancy and directional network stiffening ensure robust tissue folding with proper orientation.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary restriction is known to extend the lifespan and reduce fat stores in most species tested to date, but the molecular mechanisms linking these events remain unclear. Here, we found that bacterial deprivation of Caenorhabditis elegans leads to lifespan extension with concomitant mobilization of fat stores. We find that LIPL-5 expression is induced by starvation and that the LIPL-5 lipase is present in coelomocyte cells and regulates fat catabolism and longevity during the bacterial deprivation response. Either LIPL-5 or coelomocyte deficiency prevents the rapid mobilization of intestinal triacylglycerol and enhanced lifespan extension in response to bacterial deprivation, whereas the combination of both defects has no additional or synergistic effect. Thus, the capacity to mobilize fat via LIPL-5 is directly linked to an animal’s capacity to withstand long-term nutrient deprivation. Our data establish a role for LIPL-5 and coelomocytes in regulating fat consumption and lifespan extension upon DR.

Abstract: Summary
Efforts to target glutamine metabolism for cancer therapy have focused on the glutaminase isozyme GLS. The importance of the other isozyme, GLS2, in cancer has remained unclear, and it has been described as a tumor suppressor in some contexts. Here, we report that GLS2 is upregulated and essential in luminal-subtype breast tumors, which account for >70% of breast cancer incidence. We show that GLS2 expression is elevated by GATA3 in luminal-subtype cells but suppressed by promoter methylation in basal-subtype cells. Although luminal breast cancers resist GLS-selective inhibitors, we find that they can be targeted with a dual-GLS/GLS2 inhibitor. These results establish a critical role for GLS2 in mammary tumorigenesis and advance our understanding of how to target glutamine metabolism in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Merlin/NF2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor whose mutations underlie inherited tumor syndrome neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), as well as various sporadic cancers including kidney cancer. Multiple Merlin/NF2 effector pathways including the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway have been identified. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the growth and survival of NF2-mutant tumors remain poorly understood. Using an inducible orthotopic kidney tumor model, we demonstrate that YAP/TAZ silencing is sufficient to induce regression of pre-established NF2-deficient tumors. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ depletion diminishes glycolysis-dependent growth and increases mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) buildup, resulting in oxidative-stress-induced cell death when challenged by nutrient stress. Furthermore, we identify lysosome-mediated cAMP-PKA/EPAC-dependent activation of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling as a resistance mechanism to YAP/TAZ inhibition. Finally, unbiased analysis of TCGA primary kidney tumor transcriptomes confirms a positive correlation of a YAP/TAZ signature with glycolysis and inverse correlations with oxidative phosphorylation and lysosomal gene expression, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings.

Abstract: Summary
Many studies have highlighted the role of dysregulated glucagon secretion in the etiology of hyperglycemia and diabetes. Accordingly, understanding the mechanisms underlying pancreatic islet α cell development and function has important implications for the discovery of new therapies for diabetes. In this study, comparative transcriptome analyses between embryonic mouse pancreas and adult mouse islets identified several pancreatic lncRNAs that lie in close proximity to essential pancreatic transcription factors, including the Pax6-associated lncRNA Paupar. We demonstrate that Paupar is enriched in glucagon-producing α cells where it promotes the alternative splicing of Pax6 to an isoform required for activation of essential α cell genes. Consistently, deletion of Paupar in mice resulted in dysregulation of PAX6 α cell target genes and corresponding α cell dysfunction, including blunted glucagon secretion. These findings illustrate a distinct mechanism by which a pancreatic lncRNA can coordinate glucose homeostasis by cell-specific regulation of a broadly expressed transcription factor.

Abstract: Tumor cells can vary epigenetically during ionizing irradiation (IR) treatment. These epigenetic variegations can influence IR response and shape tumor aggressiveness. However, epigenetic disturbance of histones after IR, implicating in IR responsiveness, has been elusive. Here, we investigate whether altered histone modification after IR can influence radiation responsiveness. The oncogenic CXCL12 mRNA and protein were more highly expressed in residual cancer cells from a hepatoma heterotopic murine tumor microenvironment and coculture of human hepatoma Huh7 and normal IMR90 cells after radiation. H3K4 methylation was also enriched and H3K9 methylation was decreased at its promoter region. Accordingly, invasiveness and the subpopulation of aggressive CD133+/CD24− cells increased after IR. Histone demethylase inhibitor IOX1 attenuated CXCL12 expression and the malignant subpopulation, suggesting that responses to IR can be partially mediated via histone modifications. Taken together, radiation-induced histone alterations at the CXCL12 promoter in hepatoma cells are linked to CXCL12 upregulation and increased aggressiveness in the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute-bound microRNAs silence mRNA expression in a dynamic and regulated manner to control organismal development, physiology, and disease. We employed metabolic small RNA sequencing for a comprehensive view on intracellular microRNA kinetics in Drosophila. Based on absolute rate of biogenesis and decay, microRNAs rank among the fastest produced and longest-lived cellular transcripts, disposing up to 105 copies per cell at steady-state. Mature microRNAs are produced within minutes, revealing tight intracellular coupling of biogenesis that is selectively disrupted by pre-miRNA-uridylation. Control over Argonaute protein homeostasis generates a kinetic bottleneck that cooperates with non-coding RNA surveillance to ensure faithful microRNA loading. Finally, regulated small RNA decay enables the selective rapid turnover of Ago1-bound microRNAs, but not of Ago2-bound small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), reflecting key differences in the robustness of small RNA silencing pathways. Time-resolved small RNA sequencing opens new experimental avenues to deconvolute the timescales, molecular features, and regulation of small RNA silencing pathways in living cells.

Abstract: Summary
THO/TREX is a conserved complex with a role in messenger ribonucleoprotein biogenesis that links gene expression and genome instability. Here, we show that human THO interacts with MFAP1 (microfibrillar-associated protein 1), a spliceosome-associated factor. Interestingly, MFAP1 depletion impairs cell proliferation and genome integrity, increasing γH2AX foci and DNA breaks. This phenotype is not dependent on either transcription or RNA-DNA hybrids. Mutations in the yeast orthologous gene SPP381 cause similar transcription-independent genome instability, supporting a conserved role. MFAP1 depletion has a wide effect on splicing and gene expression in human cells, determined by transcriptome analyses. MFAP1 depletion affects a number of DNA damage response (DDR) genes, which supports an indirect role of MFAP1 on genome integrity. Our work defines a functional interaction between THO and RNA processing and argues that splicing factors may contribute to genome integrity indirectly by regulating the expression of DDR genes rather than by a direct role.

Abstract: Summary
The biochemical transduction of excitatory synaptic signals occurs in the cytoplasm within dendritic spines. The associated reaction kinetics are shaped by the mobility of the signaling molecules; however, accurate monitoring of diffusional events within the femtoliter-sized spine structures has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we applied two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and raster image correlation spectroscopy to monitor protein dynamics within spines, revealing that F-actin restricts the mobility of proteins with a molecular mass of >100 kDa. This restriction is transiently removed during actin remodeling at the initial phase of spine structural plasticity. Photobleaching experiments combined with super-resolution imaging indicate that this increase in mobility facilitates molecular interactions, which may modulate the functions of key postsynaptic signaling molecules, such as Tiam1 and CaMKII. Thus, actin polymers in dendritic spines act as precise temporal regulators of molecular diffusion and modulate signal transduction during synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
The structural diversity of glycans on cells—the glycome—is vast and complex to decipher. Glycan arrays display oligosaccharides and are used to report glycan hapten binding epitopes. Glycan arrays are limited resources and present saccharides without the context of other glycans and glycoconjugates. We used maps of glycosylation pathways to generate a library of isogenic HEK293 cells with combinatorially engineered glycosylation capacities designed to display and dissect the genetic, biosynthetic, and structural basis for glycan binding in a natural context. The cell-based glycan array is self-renewable and reports glycosyltransferase genes required (or blocking) for interactions through logical sequential biosynthetic steps, which is predictive of structural glycan features involved and provides instructions for synthesis, recombinant production, and genetic dissection strategies. Broad utility of the cell-based glycan array is demonstrated, and we uncover higher order binding of microbial adhesins to clustered patches of O-glycans organized by their presentation on proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic DNA is framed by additional layers of information, referred to as the epigenome. Epigenomic marks such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and histone variants are concentrated on specific genomic sites, where they can both instruct and reflect gene expression. How this information is maintained, notably in the face of transcription, is not completely understood. Specifically, the extent to which modified histones themselves are retained through RNA polymerase II passage is unclear. Here, we show that several histone modifications are mislocalized when the transcription-coupled histone chaperones FACT or Spt6 are disrupted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the absence of functional FACT or Spt6, transcription generates nucleosome loss, which is partially compensated for by the increased activity of non-transcription-coupled histone chaperones. The random incorporation of transcription-evicted modified histones scrambles epigenomic information. Our work highlights the importance of local recycling of modified histones by FACT and Spt6 during transcription in the maintenance of the epigenomic landscape.

Abstract: Summary
Properly regulated mitochondrial networks are essential for cellular function and implicated in multiple diseases. Mitochondria undergo fission and fusion events, but the dynamics and regulation of a third event of inter-mitochondrial contact formation remain unclear. Using super-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that inter-mitochondrial contacts frequently form and play a fundamental role in mitochondrial networks by restricting mitochondrial motility. Inter-mitochondrial contact untethering events are marked and regulated by mitochondria-lysosome contacts, which are modulated by RAB7 GTP hydrolysis. Moreover, inter-mitochondrial contact formation and untethering are further regulated by Mfn1/2 and Drp1 GTP hydrolysis, respectively. Surprisingly, endoplasmic reticulum tubules are also present at inter-mitochondrial contact untethering events, in addition to mitochondrial fission and fusion events. Importantly, we find that multiple Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 disease-linked mutations in Mfn2 (CMT2A), RAB7 (CMT2B), and TRPV4 (CMT2C) converge on prolonged inter-mitochondrial contacts and defective mitochondrial motility, highlighting a role for inter-mitochondrial contacts in mitochondrial network regulation and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Following axon pathfinding, growth cones transition from stochastic filopodial exploration to the formation of a limited number of synapses. How the interplay of filopodia and synapse assembly ensures robust connectivity in the brain has remained a challenging problem. Here, we developed a new 4D analysis method for filopodial dynamics and a data-driven computational model of synapse formation for R7 photoreceptor axons in developing Drosophila brains. Our live data support a “serial synapse formation” model, where at any time point only 1–2 “synaptogenic” filopodia suppress the synaptic competence of other filopodia through competition for synaptic seeding factors. Loss of the synaptic seeding factors Syd-1 and Liprin-α leads to a loss of this suppression, filopodial destabilization, and reduced synapse formation. The failure to form synapses can cause the destabilization and secondary retraction of axon terminals. Our model provides a filopodial “winner-takes-all” mechanism that ensures the formation of an appropriate number of synapses.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC1 regulates cellular growth and is activated by growth factors and by essential amino acids such as Leu. Leu enters cells via the Leu transporter LAT1-4F2hc (LAT1). Here we show that the Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter NKCC1 (SLC12A2), a known regulator of cell volume, is present in complex with LAT1. We further show that NKCC1 depletion or deletion enhances LAT1 activity, as well as activation of Akt and Erk, leading to activation of mTORC1 in cells, colonic organoids, and mouse colon. Moreover, NKCC1 depletion reduces intracellular Na+ concentration and cell volume (size) and mass and stimulates cell proliferation. NKCC1, therefore, suppresses mTORC1 by inhibiting its key activating signaling pathways. Importantly, by linking ion transport and cell volume regulation to mTORC1 function, NKCC1 provides a long-sought link connecting cell volume (size) to cell mass regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Laminin 332-deficient junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a severe genetic skin disease. JEB is marked by epidermal stem cell depletion, the origin of which is unknown. We show that dysregulation of the YAP and TAZ pathway underpins such stem cell depletion. Laminin 332-mediated YAP activity sustains human epidermal stem cells, detected as holoclones. Ablation of YAP selectively depletes holoclones, while enforced YAP blocks conversion of stem cells into progenitors and indefinitely extends the keratinocyte lifespan. YAP is dramatically decreased in JEB keratinocytes, which contain only phosphorylated, inactive YAP. In normal keratinocytes, laminin 332 and α6β4 ablation abolish YAP activity and recapitulate the JEB phenotype. In JEB keratinocytes, laminin 332-gene therapy rescues YAP activity and epidermal stem cells in vitro and in vivo. In JEB cells, enforced YAP recapitulates laminin 332-gene therapy, thus uncoupling adhesion from proliferation in epidermal stem cells. This work has important clinical implication for ex vivo gene therapy of JEB.

Abstract: Summary
The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is a conserved and fundamental process during which the maternal environment is converted to an environment of embryonic-driven development through dramatic reprogramming. However, how maternally supplied transcripts are dynamically regulated during MZT remains largely unknown. Herein, through genome-wide profiling of RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification in zebrafish early embryos, we found that m5C-modified maternal mRNAs display higher stability than non-m5C-modified mRNAs during MZT. We discovered that Y-box binding protein 1 (Ybx1) preferentially recognizes m5C-modified mRNAs through π-π interactions with a key residue, Trp45, in Ybx1’s cold shock domain (CSD), which plays essential roles in maternal mRNA stability and early embryogenesis of zebrafish. Together with the mRNA stabilizer Pabpc1a, Ybx1 promotes the stability of its target mRNAs in an m5C-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates an unexpected mechanism of RNA m5C-regulated maternal mRNA stabilization during zebrafish MZT, highlighting the critical role of m5C mRNA modification in early development.

Abstract: Summary
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dicentric chromosomes stemming from telomere fusions preferentially break at the fusion. This process restores a normal karyotype and protects chromosomes from the detrimental consequences of accidental fusions. Here, we address the molecular basis of this rescue pathway. We observe that tandem arrays tightly bound by the telomere factor Rap1 or a heterologous high-affinity DNA binding factor are sufficient to establish breakage hotspots, mimicking telomere fusions within dicentrics. We also show that condensins generate forces sufficient to rapidly refold dicentrics prior to breakage by cytokinesis and are essential to the preferential breakage at telomere fusions. Thus, the rescue of fused telomeres results from a condensin- and Rap1-driven chromosome folding that favors fusion entrapment where abscission takes place. Because a close spacing between the DNA-bound Rap1 molecules is essential to this process, Rap1 may act by stalling condensins.

Abstract: Summary
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) initiates with diminished rod photoreceptor function, causing peripheral and night-time vision loss. However, subsequent loss of cone function and high-resolution daylight and color vision is most debilitating. Visual pigment-rich photoreceptor outer segments (OS) undergo phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the RPE also acts as a blood-outer retinal barrier transporting nutrients, including glucose, to photoreceptors. We provide evidence that contact between externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) on OS tips and apical RPE receptors activates Akt, linking phagocytosis with glucose transport to photoreceptors for new OS synthesis. As abundant mutant rod OS tips shorten in RP, Akt activation is lost, and onset of glucose metabolism in the RPE and diminished glucose transport combine to cause photoreceptor starvation and accompanying retinal metabolome changes. Subretinal injection of OS tip mimetics displaying PS restores Akt activation, glucose transport, and cone function in end-stage RP after rods are lost.

Abstract: Summary
The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxiPPP) contributes to cell metabolism through not only the production of metabolic intermediates and reductive NADPH but also inhibition of LKB1-AMPK signaling by ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru-5-P), the product of the third oxiPPP enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD). However, we found that knockdown of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first oxiPPP enzyme, did not affect AMPK activation despite decreased Ru-5-P and subsequent LKB1 activation, due to enhanced activity of PP2A, the upstream phosphatase of AMPK. In contrast, knockdown of 6PGD or 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PGLS), the second oxiPPP enzyme, reduced PP2A activity. Mechanistically, knockdown of G6PD or PGLS decreased or increased 6-phosphogluconolactone level, respectively, which enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of PP2A by Src. Furthermore, γ-6-phosphogluconolactone, an oxiPPP byproduct with unknown function generated through intramolecular rearrangement of δ-6-phosphogluconolactone, the only substrate of PGLS, bound to Src and enhanced PP2A recruitment. Together, oxiPPP regulates AMPK homeostasis by balancing the opposing LKB1 and PP2A.

Abstract: Summary
The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), an intractable interstitial lung disease, is unclear. Recessive mutations in some genes implicated in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) cause HPS-associated interstitial pneumonia (HPSIP), a clinical entity that is similar to IPF. We previously reported that HPS1−/− embryonic stem cell-derived 3D lung organoids showed fibrotic changes. Here, we show that the introduction of all HPS mutations associated with HPSIP promotes fibrotic changes in lung organoids, while the deletion of HPS8, which is not associated with HPSIP, does not. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed the upregulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) in epithelial cells from HPS mutant fibrotic organoids. IL-11 was detected predominantly in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in end-stage IPF, but was expressed more broadly in HPSIP. Finally, IL-11 induced fibrosis in WT organoids, while its deletion prevented fibrosis in HPS4−/− organoids, suggesting IL-11 as a therapeutic target. hPSC-derived 3D lung organoids are, therefore, a valuable resource to model fibrotic lung disease.

Abstract: Summary
The epiblast is a pluripotent cell population first formed in preimplantation embryos, and its quality is important for proper development. Here, we examined the mechanisms of epiblast formation and found that the Hippo pathway transcription factor TEAD and its coactivator YAP regulate expression of pluripotency factors. After specification of the inner cell mass, YAP accumulates in the nuclei and activates TEAD. TEAD activity is required for strong expression of pluripotency factors and is variable in the forming epiblast. Cells showing low TEAD activity are eliminated from the epiblast through cell competition. Pluripotency factor expression and MYC control cell competition downstream of TEAD activity. Cell competition eliminates unspecified cells and is required for proper organization of the epiblast. These results suggest that induction of pluripotency factors by TEAD activity and elimination of unspecified cells via cell competition ensure the production of an epiblast with naive pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular diversity in tumors is a key factor for therapeutic failures and lethal outcomes of solid malignancies. Here, we determined the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of liver cancer biospecimens from 19 patients. We found varying degrees of heterogeneity in malignant cells within and between tumors and diverse landscapes of tumor microenvironment (TME). Strikingly, tumors with higher transcriptomic diversity were associated with patient's worse overall survival. We found a link between hypoxia-dependent vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor diversity and TME polarization. Moreover, T cells from higher heterogeneous tumors showed lower cytolytic activities. Consistent results were found using bulk genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 765 liver tumors. Our results offer insight into the diverse ecosystem of liver cancer and its impact on patient prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
Rodents are the main model systems for pain research, but determining their pain state is challenging. To develop an objective method to assess pain sensation in mice, we adopt high-speed videography to capture sub-second behavioral features following hind paw stimulation with both noxious and innocuous stimuli and identify several differentiating parameters indicating the affective and reflexive aspects of nociception. Using statistical modeling and machine learning, we integrate these parameters into a single index and create a “mouse pain scale,” which allows us to assess pain sensation in a graded manner for each withdrawal. We demonstrate the utility of this method by determining sensations triggered by three different von Frey hairs and optogenetic activation of two different nociceptor populations. Our behavior-based “pain scale” approach will help improve the rigor and reproducibility of using withdrawal reflex assays to assess pain sensation in mice.

Mechanisms for Hfq-Independent Activation of rpoS by DsrA, a Small RNA, in Escherichia coli,

Abstract: Many small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate gene expression by base pairing to their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with the help of Hfq in Escherichia coli. The sRNA DsrA activates translation of the rpoS mRNA in an Hfq-dependent manner, but this activation ability was found to partially bypass Hfq when DsrA is overproduced. The precise mechanism by which DsrA bypasses Hfq is unknown. In this study, we constructed strains lacking all three rpoS-activating sRNAs (i.e., ArcZ, DsrA, and RprA) in hfq+ and Hfq− backgrounds, and then artificially regulated the cellular DsrA concentration in these strains by controlling its ectopic expression. We then examined how the expression level of rpoS was altered by a change in the concentration of DsrA. We found that the translation and stability of the rpoS mRNA are both enhanced by physiological concentrations of DsrA regardless of Hfq, but that depletion of Hfq causes a rapid degradation of DsrA and thereby decreases rpoS mRNA stability. These results suggest that the observed Hfq dependency of DsrA-mediated rpoS activation mainly results from the destabilization of DsrA in the absence of Hfq, and that DsrA itself contributes to the translational activation and stability of the rpoS mRNA in an Hfq-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) broadly regulate gene expression through association with Argonaute (Ago), which also protects miRNAs from degradation. However, miRNA stability is known to vary and is regulated by poorly understood mechanisms. A major emerging process, termed target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD), employs specialized target RNAs to selectively bind to miRNAs and induce their decay. Here, we report structures of human Ago2 (hAgo2) bound to miRNAs and TDMD-inducing targets. miRNA and target form a bipartite duplex with an unpaired flexible linker. hAgo2 cannot physically accommodate the RNA, causing the duplex to bend at the linker and display the miRNA 3′ end for enzymatic attack. Altering 3′ end display by changing linker flexibility, changing 3′ end complementarity, or mutationally inducing 3′ end release impacts TDMD efficiency, leading to production of distinct 3′-miRNA isoforms in cells. Our results uncover the mechanism driving TDMD and reveal 3′ end display as a key determinant regulating miRNA activity via 3′ remodeling and/or degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Common wheat has three sets of sub-genomes, making mutations difficult to observe, especially for traits controlled by recessive genes. Here, we produced hexaploid wheat lines with loss of function of homeoalleles of Qsd1, which controls seed dormancy in barley, by Agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR/Cas9. Of the eight transformed wheat events produced, three independent events carrying multiple mutations in wheat Qsd1 homeoalleles were obtained. Notably, one line had mutations in every homeoallele. We crossed this plant with wild-type cultivar Fielder to generate a transgene-free triple-recessive mutant, as revealed by Mendelian segregation. The mutant showed a significantly longer seed dormancy period than wild-type, which may result in reduced pre-harvest sprouting of grains on spikes. PCR, southern blotting, and whole-genome shotgun sequencing revealed that this segregant lacked transgenes in its genomic sequence. This technique serves as a model for trait improvement in wheat, particularly for genetically recessive traits, based on locus information from diploid barley.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated the role of chemokines in regulating T cell accumulation in solid tumors. CCL5 and CXCL9 overexpression was associated with CD8+ T cell infiltration in solid tumors. T cell infiltration required tumor cell-derived CCL5 and was amplified by IFN-γ-inducible, myeloid cell-secreted CXCL9. CCL5 and CXCL9 coexpression revealed immunoreactive tumors with prolonged survival and response to checkpoint blockade. Loss of CCL5 expression in human tumors was associated with epigenetic silencing through DNA methylation. Reduction of CCL5 expression caused tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) desertification, whereas forced CCL5 expression prevented Cxcl9 expression and TILs loss, and attenuated tumor growth in mice through IFN-γ. The cooperation between tumor-derived CCL5 and IFN-γ-inducible CXCR3 ligands secreted by myeloid cells is key for orchestrating T cell infiltration in immunoreactive and immunoresponsive tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental processes that control root system architecture are critical for soil exploration by plants, allowing for uptake of water and nutrients. Conversion of the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) to active auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) modulates lateral root formation. However, mechanisms governing IBA-to-IAA conversion have yet to be elucidated. We identified TRANSPORTER OF IBA1 (TOB1) as a vacuolar IBA transporter that limits lateral root formation. Moreover, TOB1, which is transcriptionally regulated by the phytohormone cytokinin, is necessary for the ability of cytokinin to exert inhibitory effects on lateral root production. The increased production of lateral roots in tob1 mutants, TOB1 transport of IBA into the vacuole, and cytokinin-regulated TOB1 expression provide a mechanism linking cytokinin signaling and IBA contribution to the auxin pool to tune root system architecture.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular responses induced by mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. Intrigued by the lack of almost any glomerular phenotype in patients with profound renal ischemia, we comprehensively investigated the primary sources of energy of glomerular podocytes. Combining functional measurements of oxygen consumption rates, glomerular metabolite analysis, and determination of mitochondrial density of podocytes in vivo, we demonstrate that anaerobic glycolysis and fermentation of glucose to lactate represent the key energy source of podocytes. Under physiological conditions, we could detect neither a developmental nor late-onset pathological phenotype in podocytes with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis machinery, defective mitochondrial fusion-fission apparatus, or reduced mtDNA stability and transcription caused by podocyte-specific deletion of Pgc-1α, Drp1, or Tfam, respectively. Anaerobic glycolysis represents the predominant metabolic pathway of podocytes. These findings offer a strategy to therapeutically interfere with the enhanced podocyte metabolism in various progressive kidney diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

Abstract: Summary
By modulating the human gut microbiome, prebiotics and probiotics (combinations of which are called synbiotics) may be used to treat diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC). Methodological limitations have prevented determining the potential combinatorial mechanisms of action of such regimens. We expanded our HuMiX gut-on-a-chip model to co-culture CRC-derived epithelial cells with a model probiotic under a simulated prebiotic regimen, and we integrated the multi-omic results with in silico metabolic modeling. In contrast to individual prebiotic or probiotic treatments, the synbiotic regimen caused downregulation of genes involved in procarcinogenic pathways and drug resistance, and reduced levels of the oncometabolite lactate. Distinct ratios of organic and short-chain fatty acids were produced during the simulated regimens. Treatment of primary CRC-derived cells with a molecular cocktail reflecting the synbiotic regimen attenuated self-renewal capacity. Our integrated approach demonstrates the potential of modeling for rationally formulating synbiotics-based treatments in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Septate junction (SJ) complex proteins act in unison to provide a paracellular barrier and maintain structural integrity. Here, we identify a non-barrier role of two individual SJ proteins, Coracle (Cora) and Kune-kune (Kune). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-p38 MAPK signaling in non-myocytic pericardial cells (PCs) is important for maintaining normal cardiac physiology in Drosophila. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We find that in PCs, Cora and Kune are altered in abundance in response to manipulations of ROS-p38 signaling. Genetic analyses establish Cora and Kune as key effectors of ROS-p38 signaling in PCs on proper heart function. We further determine that Cora regulates normal Kune levels in PCs, which in turn modulates normal Kune levels in the cardiomyocytes essential for proper heart function. Our results thereby reveal select SJ proteins Cora and Kune as signaling mediators of the PC-derived ROS regulation of cardiac physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Germ granules are biomolecular condensates that promote germ cell totipotency in animals. In C. elegans, MEG-3 and MEG-4 function redundantly to assemble germ granules in germline blastomeres. Here, we show that meg-3/4 mutant animals exhibit defects in RNA interference (RNAi) that are transgenerationally disconnected from the meg-3/4 genotype. Similar non-Mendelian inheritance is associated with other mutations disrupting germ granule formation, indicating that loss of germ granules is the likely cause of the observed disconnects between genotype and phenotype. meg-3/4 animals produce aberrant siRNAs that are propagated for ≅10 generations in wild-type descendants of meg-3/4 ancestors. Aberrant siRNAs inappropriately and heritably silence germline-expressed genes including the RNAi gene sid-1, suggesting that transgenerational silencing of sid-1 underlies inherited defects in RNAi. We conclude that one function of germ granules is to organize RNA-based epigenetic inheritance pathways and that germ granule loss has consequences that persist for many generations.

Abstract: Summary
Pain perception is essential for survival and can be amplified or suppressed by expectations, experiences, and context. The neural mechanisms underlying bidirectional modulation of pain remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) functions as a pain rheostat, decreasing or increasing pain-related behaviors in mice. This dual and opposing function of the CeA is encoded by opposing changes in the excitability of two distinct subpopulations of GABAergic neurons that receive excitatory inputs from the parabrachial nucleus (PB). Thus, cells expressing protein kinase C-delta (CeA-PKCδ) are sensitized by nerve injury and increase pain-related responses. In contrast, cells expressing somatostatin (CeA-Som) are inhibited by nerve injury and their activity drives antinociception. Together, these results demonstrate that the CeA can amplify or suppress pain in a cell-type-specific manner, uncovering a previously unknown mechanism underlying bidirectional control of pain in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
The retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) integrates into the host DNA, achieves persistent infection, and induces human diseases. Here, we demonstrate that viral DNA-capture sequencing (DNA-capture-seq) is useful to characterize HTLV-1 proviruses in naturally virus-infected individuals, providing comprehensive information about the proviral structure and the viral integration site. We analyzed peripheral blood from 98 naturally HTLV-1-infected individuals and found that defective proviruses were present not only in patients with leukemia, but also in those with other clinical entities. We further demonstrated that clones with defective-type proviruses exhibited a higher degree of clonal abundance than those with full-length proviruses. The frequency of defective-type proviruses in HTLV-1-infected humanized mice was lower than that in infected individuals, indicating that defective proviruses were rare at the initial phase of infection but preferentially selected during persistent infection. These results demonstrate the robustness of viral DNA-capture-seq for HTLV-1 infection and suggest potential applications for other virus-associated cancers in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising target for anti-obesity interventions. This prospective test-retest study assessed the repeatability of several important quantitative BAT metrics. After cold activation, 24 subjects underwent positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), utilizing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Repeat imaging occurred within 14 days per an identical protocol. BAT volumes were strongly correlated between sessions for PET/CT (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.85) and PET/MRI (ICC, 0.82). BAT maximum lean-body-mass-adjusted standardized uptake values (SULmax) were also strongly correlated between sessions for both PET/CT (ICC, 0.74) and PET/MRI (ICC, 0.83). Much longitudinal variability in BAT metrics was likely due to biological factors intrinsic to BAT, whole-body metabolic fluctuations, or temporal differences in cold-activation efficacy, rather than imaging factors. Future studies utilizing these imaging metrics to track the response BAT to interventions should incorporate this variation into sample-size considerations and response criteria.

Abstract: Summary
Cachexia is a wasting syndrome characterized by pronounced skeletal muscle loss. In cancer, cachexia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and decreased treatment tolerance. Although advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms of cachexia, translating these advances to the clinic has been challenging. One reason for this shortcoming may be the current animal models, which fail to fully recapitulate the etiology of human cancer-induced tissue wasting. Because pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) presents with a high incidence of cachexia, we engineered a mouse model of PDA that we named KPP. KPP mice, similar to PDA patients, progressively lose skeletal and adipose mass as a consequence of their tumors. In addition, KPP muscles exhibit a similar gene ontology as cachectic patients. We envision that the KPP model will be a useful resource for advancing our mechanistic understanding and ability to treat cancer cachexia.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial AAA+ quality-control proteases regulate diverse aspects of mitochondrial biology through specialized protein degradation, but the underlying mechanisms of these enzymes remain poorly defined. The mitochondrial AAA+ protease AFG3L2 is of particular interest, as genetic mutations localized throughout AFG3L2 are linked to diverse neurodegenerative disorders. However, a lack of structural data has limited our understanding of how mutations impact enzymatic function. Here, we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a substrate-bound structure of the catalytic core of human AFG3L2. This structure identifies multiple specialized structural features that integrate with conserved motifs required for ATP-dependent translocation to unfold and degrade targeted proteins. Many disease-relevant mutations localize to these unique structural features of AFG3L2 and distinctly influence its activity and stability. Our results provide a molecular basis for neurological phenotypes associated with different AFG3L2 mutations and establish a structural framework to understand how different members of the AAA+ superfamily achieve specialized biological functions.

Abstract: Summary
Liver cancers are highly heterogeneous with poor prognosis and drug response. A better understanding between genetic alterations and drug responses would facilitate precision treatment for liver cancers. To characterize the landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions in liver cancers, we developed a protocol to establish human liver cancer cell models at a success rate of around 50% and generated the Liver Cancer Model Repository (LIMORE) with 81 cell models. LIMORE represented genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity of primary cancers. Interrogation of the pharmacogenomic landscape of LIMORE discovered unexplored gene-drug associations, including synthetic lethalities to prevalent alterations in liver cancers. Moreover, predictive biomarker candidates were suggested for the selection of sorafenib-responding patients. LIMORE provides a rich resource facilitating drug discovery in liver cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are intracellular Ca2+ release channels controlling essential cellular functions. RyRs are targeted by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), a controversial regulation implicated in disorders ranging from heart failure to Alzheimer’s. Using crystal structures, we show that the phosphorylation hotspot domain of RyR2 embraces the PKA catalytic subunit, with an extensive interface not seen in PKA complexes with peptides. We trapped an intermediary open-form PKA bound to the RyR2 domain and an ATP analog, showing that PKA can engage substrates in an open form. Phosphomimetics or prior phosphorylation at nearby sites in RyR2 either enhance or reduce the activity of PKA. Finally, we show that a phosphomimetic at S2813, a well-known target site for calmodulin-dependent kinase II, induces the formation of an alpha helix in the phosphorylation domain, resulting in increased interactions and PKA activity. This shows that the different phosphorylation sites in RyR2 are not independent.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid membranes are the border between living cells and their environments. The membrane’s lipid composition defines fluidity, thickness, and protein activity and is controlled by the intricate actions of lipid gene-encoded enzymes. However, a comprehensive analysis of each protein’s contribution to the lipidome is lacking. Here, we present such a comprehensive and functional overview of lipid genes in Escherichia coli by individual overexpression or deletion of these genes. We developed a high-throughput lipidomic platform, combining growth analysis, one-step lipid extraction, rapid LC-MS, and bioinformatic analysis into one streamlined procedure. This allowed the processing of more than 300 samples per day and revealed interesting functions of known enzymes and distinct effects of individual proteins on the phospholipidome. Our data demonstrate the plasticity of the phospholipidome and unexpected relations between lipid classes and cell growth. Modeling of lipidomic responses to short-chain alcohols provides a rationale for targeted membrane engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), the main receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), is key in preventing atherosclerosis. It removes cholesterol from HDL, returning the lipid-poor lipoprotein to the circulation. To study the mechanisms controlling SR-B1 dynamics at the plasma membrane and its internalization rate, we developed a single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) antibody to image the receptor in live cells and track the behavior of single SR-B1 molecules. Unlike transferrin receptors, cholera-toxin-binding gangliosides, and bulk membrane markers, SR-B1 was internalized only marginally over hours. Plasmalemmal retention was not attributable to its C-terminal PDZ-binding domain or to attachment to the cortical cytoskeleton. Instead, SR-B1 undergoes multimerization into large metastable clusters that, despite being mobile in the membrane, fail to enter endocytic pathways. SR-B1 multimerization was impaired by mutating its C-terminal leucine zipper and by disrupting actin polymerization, causing rapid receptor internalization. Multimerization and plasmalemmal retention are critical for SR-B1 function.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson’s disease causes the most profound loss of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1-positive (ALDH1A1+) nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron (nDAN) subpopulation. The connectivity and functionality of ALDH1A1+ nDANs, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we show in rodent brains that ALDH1A1+ nDANs project predominantly to the rostral dorsal striatum, from which they also receive most monosynaptic inputs, indicating extensive reciprocal innervations with the striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Functionally, genetic ablation of ALDH1A1+ nDANs causes severe impairments in motor skill learning, along with a reduction in high-speed walking. While dopamine replacement therapy accelerated walking speed, it failed to improve motor skill learning in ALDH1A1+ nDAN-ablated mice. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive whole-brain connectivity map and reveals a key physiological function of ALDH1A1+ nDANs in motor skill acquisition, suggesting the motor learning processes require ALDH1A1+ nDANs to integrate diverse presynaptic inputs and supply dopamine with dynamic precision.

Abstract: Summary
Alternatively activated (M2) macrophages promote wound healing but weaken antimicrobial defenses. The mechanisms that enforce macrophage divergence and dictate the phenotypic and metabolic characteristics of M2 macrophages remain elusive. We show that alternative activation with interleukin (IL)-4 induces expression of metallothionein 3 (MT3) that regulates macrophage polarization and function. MT3 was requisite for metabolic reprograming in IL-4-stimulated macrophages or M(IL-4) macrophages to promote mitochondrial respiration and suppress glycolysis. MT3 fostered an M(IL-4) phenotype, suppressed hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α activation, and thwarted the emergence of a proinflammatory M1 program in macrophages. MT3 deficiency augmented macrophage plasticity, resulting in enhanced interferon γ (IFNγ) responsiveness and a dampened M(IL-4) phenotype. Thus, MT3 programs the phenotype and metabolic fate of M(IL-4) macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
During early spinal cord development, neurons of particular subtypes differentiate with a sparse periodic pattern while later neurons differentiate in the intervening space to eventually produce continuous columns of similar neurons. The mechanisms that regulate this spatiotemporal pattern are unknown. In vivo imaging in zebrafish reveals that differentiating spinal neurons transiently extend two long protrusions along the basal surface of the spinal cord before axon initiation. These protrusions express Delta protein, consistent with the hypothesis they influence Notch signaling at a distance of several cell diameters. Experimental reduction of Laminin expression leads to smaller protrusions and shorter distances between differentiating neurons. The experimental data and a theoretical model support the proposal that neuronal differentiation pattern is regulated by transient basal protrusions that deliver temporally controlled lateral inhibition mediated at a distance. This work uncovers a stereotyped protrusive activity of newborn neurons that organize long-distance spatiotemporal patterning of differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Impulsively aggressive individuals may suddenly attack others when under stress, but the neural circuitry underlying stress-provoked aggression is poorly understood. Here, we report that acute stress activates ventral hippocampus (vHip) neurons to induce attack behavior in post-weaning socially isolated mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of vHip neural activity blunts stress-provoked attack behavior, whereas chemogenetic activation promotes it. The activation of cell bodies in vHip neurons projecting into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) induces attack behavior, suggesting that the vHip-VMH projection contributes to impulsive aggression. Furthermore, optogenetic inhibition of vHip glutamatergic neurons blocks stress-provoked attacks, whereas optogenetic activation of vHip glutamatergic neurons drives attack behavior. These results show direct evidence that vHip-VMH neural circuitry modulates attack behavior in socially isolated mice.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon (IFNα/β) pathways are fine-tuned to elicit antiviral protection while minimizing immunopathology; however, the initiating stimuli, target tissues, and underlying mechanisms are unclear. Using models of physiological and dysregulated IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR1) surface expression, we show here that IFNAR1-dependent signals set the steady-state IFN signature in both hematopoietic and stromal cells. Increased IFNAR1 levels promote a lung environment refractory to early influenza virus replication by elevating the baseline interferon signature. Commensal microbiota drive the IFN signature specifically in lung stroma, as shown by antibiotic treatment and fecal transplantation. Bone marrow chimera experiments identify lung stromal cells as crucially important for early antiviral immunity and stroma-immune cell interaction for late antiviral resistance. We propose that the microbiota-driven interferon signature in lung epithelia impedes early virus replication and that IFNAR1 surface levels fine-tune this signature. Our findings highlight the interplay between bacterial and viral exposure, with important implications for antibiotic use.

Abstract: Summary
How spatial chromosome organization influences genome integrity is still poorly understood. Here, we show that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) activities are enriched at chromatin loop anchors with high transcriptional activity. Recurrent DSBs occur at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin-bound sites at the bases of chromatin loops, and their frequency positively correlates with transcriptional output and directionality. The physiological relevance of this preferential positioning is indicated by the finding that genes recurrently translocating to drive leukemias are highly transcribed and are enriched at loop anchors. These genes accumulate DSBs at recurrent hotspots that give rise to chromosomal fusions relying on the activity of both TOP2 isoforms and on transcriptional elongation. We propose that transcription and 3D chromosome folding jointly pose a threat to genomic stability and are key contributors to the occurrence of genome rearrangements that drive cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Amphibians form fingers without webbing by differential growth between digital and interdigital regions. Amniotes, however, employ interdigital cell death (ICD), an additional mechanism that contributes to a greater variation of limb shapes. Here, we investigate the role of environmental oxygen in the evolution of ICD in tetrapods. While cell death is restricted to the limb margin in amphibians with aquatic tadpoles, Eleutherodactylus coqui, a frog with terrestrial-direct-developing eggs, has cell death in the interdigital region. Chicken requires sufficient oxygen and reactive oxygen species to induce cell death, with the oxygen tension profile itself being distinct between the limbs of chicken and Xenopus laevis frogs. Notably, increasing blood vessel density in X. laevis limbs, as well as incubating tadpoles under high oxygen levels, induces ICD. We propose that the oxygen available to terrestrial eggs was an ecological feature crucial for the evolution of ICD, made possible by conserved autopod-patterning mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The twin-ATPase ABCE1 has a vital function in mRNA translation by recycling terminated or stalled ribosomes. As for other functionally distinct ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, the mechanochemical coupling of ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes remains elusive. Here, we use an integrated biophysical approach allowing direct observation of conformational dynamics and ribosome association of ABCE1 at the single-molecule level. Our results from FRET experiments show that the current static two-state model of ABC proteins has to be expanded because the two ATP sites of ABCE1 are in dynamic equilibrium across three distinct conformational states: open, intermediate, and closed. The interaction of ABCE1 with ribosomes influences the conformational dynamics of both ATP sites asymmetrically and creates a complex network of conformational states. Our findings suggest a paradigm shift to redefine the understanding of the mechanochemical coupling in ABC proteins: from structure-based deterministic models to dynamic-based systems.

Abstract: Summary
AAA+ proteins form asymmetric hexameric rings that hydrolyze ATP and thread substrate proteins through a central channel via mobile substrate-binding pore loops. Understanding how ATPase and threading activities are regulated and intertwined is key to understanding the AAA+ protein mechanism. We studied the disaggregase ClpB, which contains tandem ATPase domains (AAA1, AAA2) and shifts between low and high ATPase and threading activities. Coiled-coil M-domains repress ClpB activity by encircling the AAA1 ring. Here, we determine the mechanism of ClpB activation by comparing ATPase mechanisms and cryo-EM structures of ClpB wild-type and a constitutively active ClpB M-domain mutant. We show that ClpB activation reduces ATPase cooperativity and induces a sequential mode of ATP hydrolysis in the AAA2 ring, the main ATPase motor. AAA1 and AAA2 rings do not work synchronously but in alternating cycles. This ensures high grip, enabling substrate threading via a processive, rope-climbing mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is controlled by the ratio of anti- and pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The molecular events underlying how a given physiological stimulus changes this ratio to trigger apoptosis remains unclear. We report here that human 17-β-estradiol (E2) and its related steroid hormones induce apoptosis by binding directly to phosphodiesterase 3A, which in turn recruits and stabilizes an otherwise fast-turnover protein Schlafen 12 (SLFN12). The elevated SLFN12 binds to ribosomes to exclude the recruitment of signal recognition particles (SRPs), thereby blocking the continuous protein translation occurring on the endoplasmic reticulum of E2-treated cells. These proteins include Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, whose ensuing decrease triggers apoptosis. The SLFN12 protein and an apoptosis activation marker were co-localized in syncytiotrophoblast of human placentas, where levels of estrogen-related hormones are high, and dynamic cell turnover by apoptosis is critical for successful implantation and placenta development.

Abstract: Summary
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are widely used to treat solid tumors but can be cardiotoxic. The molecular basis for this toxicity and its relationship to therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear; we therefore undertook a systems-level analysis of human cardiomyocytes (CMs) exposed to four TKIs. CMs differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were exposed to sunitinib, sorafenib, lapatinib, or erlotinib, and responses were assessed by functional assays, microscopy, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry (GEO: GSE114686; PRIDE: PXD012043). TKIs have diverse effects on hiPSC-CMs distinct from inhibition of tyrosine-kinase-mediated signal transduction; cardiac metabolism is particularly sensitive. Following sorafenib treatment, oxidative phosphorylation is downregulated, resulting in a profound defect in mitochondrial energetics. Cells adapt by upregulating aerobic glycolysis. Adaptation makes cells less acutely sensitive to sorafenib but may have long-term negative consequences. Thus, CMs exhibit adaptive responses to anti-cancer drugs conceptually similar to those previously shown in tumors to mediate drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells are key players in preventing lethal autoimmunity. Tregs undertake differentiation processes and acquire diverse functional properties. However, how Treg’s differentiation and functional specification are regulated remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that gradient expression of TCF1 and LEF1 distinguishes Tregs into three distinct subpopulations, particularly highlighting a subset of activated Treg (aTreg) cells. Treg-specific ablation of TCF1 and LEF1 renders the mice susceptible to systemic autoimmunity. TCF1 and LEF1 are dispensable for Treg’s suppressive capacity but essential for maintaining a normal aTreg pool and promoting Treg’s competitive survival. As a consequence, the development of T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells, which are a subset of aTreg, is abolished in TCF1/LEF1-conditional knockout mice, leading to unrestrained T follicular helper (Tfh) and germinal center B cell responses. Thus, TCF1 and LEF1 act redundantly to control the maintenance and functional specification of Treg subsets to prevent autoimmunity.

Abstract: Plants monitor changes in day length to coordinate their flowering time with appropriate seasons. In Arabidopsis, the diel and seasonal regulation of CONSTANS (CO) protein stability is crucial for the induction of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene in long days. FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1) and ZEITLUPE (ZTL) proteins control the shape of CO expression profile antagonistically, although regulation mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we show that GIGANTEA (GI) protein modulates the stability and nuclear function of FKF1, which is closely related to the stabilization of CO in the afternoon of long days. The abundance of FKF1 protein is decreased by the gi mutation, but increased by GI overexpression throughout the day. Unlike the previous report, the translocation of FKF1 to the nucleus was not prevented by ZTL overexpression. In addition, the FKF1-ZTL complex formation is higher in the nucleus than in the cytosol. GI interacts with ZTL in the nucleus, implicating the attenuation of ZTL activity by the GI binding and, in turn, the sequestration of FKF1 from ZTL in the nucleus. We also found that the CO-ZTL complex presents in the nucleus, and CO protein abundance is largely reduced in the afternoon by ZTL overexpression, indicating that ZTL promotes CO degradation by capturing FKF1 in the nucleus under these conditions. Collectively, our findings suggest that GI plays a pivotal role in CO stability for the precise control of flowering by coordinating balanced functional properties of FKF1 and ZTL.

Abstract: Summary
cGMP is critical to a variety of cellular processes, but the available tools to interfere with endogenous cGMP lack cellular and subcellular specificity. We introduce SponGee, a genetically encoded chelator of this cyclic nucleotide that enables in vitro and in vivo manipulations in single cells and in biochemically defined subcellular compartments. SponGee buffers physiological changes in cGMP concentration in various model systems while not affecting cAMP signals. We provide proof-of-concept strategies by using this tool to highlight the role of cGMP signaling in vivo and in discrete subcellular domains. SponGee enables the investigation of local cGMP signals in vivo and paves the way for therapeutic strategies that prevent downstream signaling activation.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway, plays crucial roles in health and disease. p62/SQSTM1 (hereafter p62) is an autophagy adaptor protein that can shuttle ubiquitinated cargo for autophagic degradation. Here, we show that upregulating the Drosophila p62 homolog ref(2)P/dp62, starting in midlife, delays the onset of pathology and prolongs healthy lifespan. Midlife induction of dp62 improves proteostasis, in aged flies, in an autophagy-dependent manner. Previous studies have reported that p62 plays a role in mediating the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy. However, the causal relationships between p62 expression, mitochondrial homeostasis, and aging remain largely unexplored. We show that upregulating dp62, in midlife, promotes mitochondrial fission, facilitates mitophagy, and improves mitochondrial function in aged flies. Finally, we show that mitochondrial fission is required for the anti-aging effects of midlife dp62 induction. Our findings indicate that p62 represents a potential therapeutic target to counteract aging and prolong health in aged mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Visual physiology is traditionally investigated by presenting stimuli with gaze held constant. However, during active viewing of a scene, information is actively acquired using systematic patterns of fixations and saccades. Prior studies suggest that during such active viewing, both nonretinal, saccade-related signals and “extra-classical” receptive field inputs modulate visual processing. This study used a set of active viewing tasks that allowed us to compare visual responses with and without direct foveal input, thus isolating the contextual eye movement-related influences. Studying nonhuman primates, we find strong contextual modulation in primary visual cortex (V1): excitability and response amplification immediately after fixation onset, transiting to suppression leading up to the next saccade. Time-frequency decomposition suggests that this amplification and suppression cycle stems from a phase reset of ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity. The impact of saccade-related contextual modulation on stimulus processing makes active visual sensing fundamentally different from the more passive processes investigated in traditional paradigms.

Abstract: Summary
Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune disease characterized by blistering sores on skin and mucosal membranes, caused by autoantibodies primarily targeting the cellular adhesion protein, desmoglein-3 (Dsg3). To better understand how Dsg3-specific autoantibodies develop and cause disease in humans, we performed a cross-sectional study of PV patients before and after treatment to track relevant cellular responses underlying disease pathogenesis, and we provide an in-depth analysis of two patients by generating a panel of mAbs from single Dsg3-specific memory B cells (MBCs). Additionally, we analyzed a paired sample from one patient collected 15-months prior to disease diagnosis. We find that Dsg3-specific MBCs have an activated phenotype and show signs of ongoing affinity maturation and clonal selection. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with pathogenic activity primarily target epitopes in the extracellular domains EC1 and EC2 of Dsg3, though they can also bind to the EC4 domain. Combining antibodies targeting different epitopes synergistically enhances in vitro pathogenicity.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes Burkitt, Hodgkin, and post-transplant B cell lymphomas. How EBV remodels metabolic pathways to support rapid B cell outgrowth remains largely unknown. To gain insights, primary human B cells were profiled by tandem-mass-tag-based proteomics at rest and at nine time points after infection; >8,000 host and 29 viral proteins were quantified, revealing mitochondrial remodeling and induction of one-carbon (1C) metabolism. EBV-encoded EBNA2 and its target MYC were required for upregulation of the central mitochondrial 1C enzyme MTHFD2, which played key roles in EBV-driven B cell growth and survival. MTHFD2 was critical for maintaining elevated NADPH levels in infected cells, and oxidation of mitochondrial NADPH diminished B cell proliferation. Tracing studies underscored contributions of 1C to nucleotide synthesis, NADPH production, and redox defense. EBV upregulated import and synthesis of serine to augment 1C flux. Our results highlight EBV-induced 1C as a potential therapeutic target and provide a new paradigm for viral onco-metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The plasma membrane (PM) is composed of a complex lipid mixture that forms heterogeneous membrane environments. Yet, how small-scale lipid organization controls physiological events at the PM remains largely unknown. Here, we show that ORP-related Osh lipid exchange proteins are critical for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], a key regulator of dynamic events at the PM. In real-time assays, we find that unsaturated phosphatidylserine (PS) and sterols, both Osh protein ligands, synergistically stimulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) activity. Biophysical FRET analyses suggest an unconventional co-distribution of unsaturated PS and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) species in sterol-containing membrane bilayers. Moreover, using in vivo imaging approaches and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that Osh protein-mediated unsaturated PI4P and PS membrane lipid organization is sensed by the PIP5K specificity loop. Thus, ORP family members create a nanoscale membrane lipid environment that drives PIP5K activity and PI(4,5)P2 synthesis that ultimately controls global PM organization and dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Condensin is a conserved SMC complex that uses its ATPase machinery to structure genomes, but how it does so is largely unknown. We show that condensin’s ATPase has a dual role in chromosome condensation. Mutation of one ATPase site impairs condensation, while mutating the second site results in hyperactive condensin that compacts DNA faster than wild-type, both in vivo and in vitro. Whereas one site drives loop formation, the second site is involved in the formation of more stable higher-order Z loop structures. Using hyperactive condensin I, we reveal that condensin II is not intrinsically needed for the shortening of mitotic chromosomes. Condensin II rather is required for a straight chromosomal axis and enables faithful chromosome segregation by counteracting the formation of ultrafine DNA bridges. SMC complexes with distinct roles for each ATPase site likely reflect a universal principle that enables these molecular machines to intricately control chromosome architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for high-fidelity DNA repair during mitotic proliferation and meiosis. Yet, context-specific modifications must tailor the recombination machinery to avoid (mitosis) or enforce (meiosis) the formation of reciprocal exchanges—crossovers—between recombining chromosomes. To obtain molecular insight into how crossover control is achieved, we affinity purified 7 DNA-processing enzymes that channel HR intermediates into crossovers or noncrossovers from vegetative cells or cells undergoing meiosis. Using mass spectrometry, we provide a global characterization of their composition and reveal mitosis- and meiosis-specific modules in the interaction networks. Functional analyses of meiosis-specific interactors of MutLγ-Exo1 identified Rtk1, Caf120, and Chd1 as regulators of crossing-over. Chd1, which transiently associates with Exo1 at the prophase-to-metaphase I transition, enables the formation of MutLγ-dependent crossovers through its conserved ability to bind and displace nucleosomes. Thus, rewiring of the HR network, coupled to chromatin remodeling, promotes context-specific control of the recombination outcome.

Abstract: Summary
Two types of monocytes, Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo, infiltrate the heart in murine experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). We discovered a role for cardiac fibroblasts in facilitating monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation of both Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo cells, allowing these macrophages to perform divergent functions in myocarditis progression. During the acute phase of EAM, IL-17A is highly abundant. It signals through cardiac fibroblasts to attenuate efferocytosis of Ly6Chi monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and simultaneously prevents Ly6Clo monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. We demonstrated an inverse clinical correlation between heart IL-17A levels and efferocytic receptor expressions in humans with heart failure (HF). In the absence of IL-17A signaling, Ly6Chi MDMs act as robust phagocytes and are less pro-inflammatory, whereas Ly6Clo monocytes resume their differentiation into MHCII+ macrophages. We propose that MHCII+Ly6Clo MDMs are associated with the reduction of cardiac fibrosis and prevention of the myocarditis sequalae.

Abstract: Summary
CD40 has major roles in B cell development, activation, and germinal center responses. CD40 hypoactivity causes immunodeficiency whereas its overexpression causes autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis. To systematically identify B cell autonomous CD40 regulators, we use CRISPR/Cas9 genome-scale screens in Daudi B cells stimulated by multimeric CD40 ligand. These highlight known CD40 pathway components and reveal multiple additional mechanisms regulating CD40. The nuclear ubiquitin ligase FBXO11 supports CD40 expression by targeting repressors CTBP1 and BCL6. FBXO11 knockout decreases primary B cell CD40 abundance and impairs class-switch recombination, suggesting that frequent lymphoma monoallelic FBXO11 mutations may balance BCL6 increase with CD40 loss. At the mRNA level, CELF1 controls exon splicing critical for CD40 activity, while the N6-adenosine methyltransferase WTAP negatively regulates CD40 mRNA abundance. At the protein level, ESCRT negatively regulates activated CD40 levels while the negative feedback phosphatase DUSP10 limits downstream MAPK responses. These results serve as a resource for future studies and highlight potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
The WNT signaling network is comprised of multiple receptors that relay various input signals via distinct transduction pathways to execute multiple complex and context-specific output processes. Integrity of the WNT signaling network relies on proper specification between canonical and noncanonical pathways, which presents a regulatory challenge given that several signal transducing elements are shared between pathways. Here, we report that USP9X, a deubiquitylase, and WWP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulate a ubiquitin rheostat on DVL2, a WNT signaling protein. Our findings indicate that USP9X-mediated deubiquitylation of DVL2 is required for canonical WNT activation, while increased DVL2 ubiquitylation is associated with localization to actin-rich projections and activation of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. We propose that a WWP1-USP9X axis regulates a ubiquitin rheostat on DVL2 that specifies its participation in either canonical WNT or WNT-PCP pathways. These findings have important implications for therapeutic targeting of USP9X in human cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The phenotypic effect of perturbing a gene’s activity depends on the activity level of other genes, reflecting the notion that phenotypes are emergent properties of a network of functionally interacting genes. In the context of cancer, contemporary investigations have primarily focused on just one type of functional relationship between two genes—synthetic lethality (SL). Here, we define the more general concept of “survival-associated pairwise gene expression states” (SPAGEs) as gene pairs whose joint expression levels are associated with survival. We describe a data-driven approach called SPAGE-finder that when applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data identified 71,946 SPAGEs spanning 12 distinct types, only a minority of which are SLs. The detected SPAGEs explain cancer driver genes’ tissue specificity and differences in patients’ response to drugs and stratify breast cancer tumors into refined subtypes. These results expand the scope of cancer SPAGEs and lay a conceptual basis for future studies of SPAGEs and their translational applications.

Abstract: Summary
How can anterograde membrane trafficking be modulated by physiological cues? A screen of Golgi-associated proteins revealed that the ARF-GEF GBF1 can selectively modulate the ER-Golgi trafficking of prohaemostatic von Willebrand factor (VWF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in human endothelial cells and in mouse fibroblasts. The relationship between levels of GBF1 and the trafficking of VWF into forming secretory granules confirmed GBF1 is a limiting factor in this process. Further, GBF1 activation by AMPK couples its control of anterograde trafficking to physiological cues; levels of glucose control GBF1 activation in turn modulating VWF trafficking into secretory granules. GBF1 modulates both ER and TGN exit, the latter dramatically affecting the size of the VWF storage organelles, thereby influencing the hemostatic capacity of the endothelium. The role of AMPK as a central integrating element of cellular pathways with intra- and extra-cellular cues can now be extended to modulation of the anterograde secretory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Topoisomerase II (TOP2) relieves torsional stress by forming transient cleavage complex intermediates (TOP2ccs) that contain TOP2-linked DNA breaks (DSBs). While TOP2ccs are normally reversible, they can be “trapped” by chemotherapeutic drugs such as etoposide and subsequently converted into irreversible TOP2-linked DSBs. Here, we have quantified etoposide-induced trapping of TOP2ccs, their conversion into irreversible TOP2-linked DSBs, and their processing during DNA repair genome-wide, as a function of time. We find that while TOP2 chromatin localization and trapping is independent of transcription, it requires pre-existing binding of cohesin to DNA. In contrast, the conversion of trapped TOP2ccs to irreversible DSBs during DNA repair is accelerated 2-fold at transcribed loci relative to non-transcribed loci. This conversion is dependent on proteasomal degradation and TDP2 phosphodiesterase activity. Quantitative modeling shows that only two features of pre-existing chromatin structure—namely, cohesin binding and transcriptional activity—can be used to predict the kinetics of TOP2-induced DSBs.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate DNA replication is essential to preserve genomic integrity and prevent chromosomal instability-associated diseases including cancer. Key to this process is the cells’ ability to stabilize and restart stalled replication forks. Here, we show that the EXD2 nuclease is essential to this process. EXD2 recruitment to stressed forks suppresses their degradation by restraining excessive fork regression. Accordingly, EXD2 deficiency leads to fork collapse, hypersensitivity to replication inhibitors, and genomic instability. Impeding fork regression by inactivation of SMARCAL1 or removal of RECQ1’s inhibition in EXD2−/− cells restores efficient fork restart and genome stability. Moreover, purified EXD2 efficiently processes substrates mimicking regressed forks. Thus, this work identifies a mechanism underpinned by EXD2’s nuclease activity, by which cells balance fork regression with fork restoration to maintain genome stability. Interestingly, from a clinical perspective, we discover that EXD2’s depletion is synthetic lethal with mutations in BRCA1/2, implying a non-redundant role in replication fork protection.

Abstract: Hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells reside in the upper part of the bulge area of the the hair follicle. HAP stem cells are nestin-positive and keratin 15-negative and have the capacity to differentiate into various types of cells in vitro. HAP stem cells are also involved in nerve and spinal cord regeneration in mouse models. Recently, it was shown that the DNA-damage response in non-HAP hair follicle stem cells induces proteolysis of type-XVII collagen (COL17A1/BP180), which is involved in hair-follicle stem-cell maintenance. COL17A1 proteolysis stimulated hair-follicle stem-cell aging, characterized by the loss of stemness signatures and hair-follicle miniaturization associated with androgenic alopecia. In the present study, we demonstrate that HAP stem cells co-express nestin and COL17A1 in vitro and in vivo. The expression of HAP stem cell markers (nestin and SSEA1) increased after HAP stem-cell colonies were formed, then decreased after differentiation to epidermal keratinocytes. In contrast COL17A1 increased after differentiation to epidermal keratinocytes. These results suggest that COL17A1 is important in differentiation of HAP stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Development of effective targeted cancer therapies is fundamentally limited by our molecular understanding of disease pathogenesis. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a fatal malignancy of the childhood pons characterized by a unique substitution to methionine in histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27M) that results in globally altered epigenetic marks and oncogenic transcription. Through primary DIPG tumor characterization and isogenic oncohistone expression, we show that the same H3K27M mutation displays distinct modes of oncogenic reprogramming and establishes distinct enhancer architecture depending upon both the variant of histone H3 and the cell context in which the mutation occurs. Compared with non-malignant pediatric pontine tissue, we identify and functionally validate both shared and variant-specific pathophysiology. Altogether, we provide a powerful resource of epigenomic data in 25 primary DIPG samples and 5 rare normal pediatric pontine tissue samples, revealing clinically relevant functional distinctions previously unidentified in DIPG.

Abstract: Summary
MRE11 nuclease forms a trimeric complex (MRN) with RAD50 and NBS1 and plays a central role in preventing genomic instability. When DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, MRN is quickly recruited to the damage site and initiates DNA end resection; accordingly, MRE11 must be tightly regulated to avoid inefficient repair or nonspecific resection. Here, we show that MRE11 and RAD50 form a complex (MRC) with C1QBP, which stabilizes MRE11/RAD50, while inhibiting MRE11 nuclease activity by preventing its binding to DNA or chromatin. Upon DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates MRE11-S676/S678 to quickly dissociate the MRC complex. Either excess or insufficient C1QBP impedes the recruitment of MRE11 to DSBs and impairs the DNA damage response. C1QBP is highly expressed in breast cancer and positively correlates with MRE11 expression, and the inhibition of C1QBP enhances tumor regression with chemotherapy. By influencing MRE11 at multiple levels, C1QBP is, thus, an important player in the DNA damage response.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their external bilateral symmetry, vertebrates have internal left/right (L/R) asymmetries required for optimal organ function. BMP-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) triggers L/R asymmetric cell movements toward the midline, higher from the right, which are crucial for heart laterality in vertebrates. However, how the L/R asymmetric levels of EMT factors are achieved is not known. Here, we show that the posterior-to-anterior Nodal wave upregulates several microRNAs (miRNAs) to transiently attenuate the levels of EMT factors (Prrx1a and Snail1) on the left LPM in a Pitx2-independent manner in the fish and mouse. These data clarify the role of Nodal in heart laterality and explain how Nodal and BMP exert their respective dominance on the left and right sides through the mutual inhibition of their respective targets, ensuring the proper balance of L/R information required for heart laterality and morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate perception of guidance cues is crucial for cell and axon migration. During initial navigation in the spinal cord, commissural axons are kept insensitive to midline repellents. Upon midline crossing in the floor plate, they switch on responsiveness to Slit and Semaphorin repulsive signals and are thus propelled away and prevented from crossing back. Whether and how the different midline repellents control specific aspects of this navigation remain to be elucidated. We set up a paradigm for live-imaging and super-resolution analysis of PlexinA1, Neuropilin-2, and Robo1/2 receptor dynamics during commissural growth cone navigation in chick and mouse embryos. We uncovered a remarkable program of sensitization to midline cues achieved by unique spatiotemporal sequences of receptor allocation at the growth-cone surface that orchestrates receptor-specific growth-cone behavior changes. This reveals post-translational mechanisms whereby coincident guidance signals are temporally resolved to allow the generation of specific guidance responses.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal microbiota is a fundamental factor that broadly influences physiology. Thus, studies using transgenic animals should be designed to limit the confounding effects of microbiota variation between strains. Here, we report the impact on intestinal microbiota of co-housed versus F2-generation littermates, two commonly used techniques to standardize microbiota in animal models. Our results establish that while fecal microbiota is partially normalized by extended co-housing, mucosal communities associated with the proximal colon and terminal ileum remain stable and distinct. In contrast, strain inter-crossing to generate F2 littermates allows robust microbiota standardization in fecal, colon, and ileum sampling locations. Using reciprocal inter-crosses of P1 parents, we identify dissymmetry in F2 community structures caused by maternal transmission, in particular of the Verrucomicrobiaceae. Thus, F2 littermate animals from a unidirectional P1 cross should be used as a standard method to minimize the influence of the microbiota in genotype-phenotype studies.

Abstract: Summary
Human erythropoiesis serves as a paradigm of physiologic cellular differentiation. This process is also of considerable interest for better understanding anemias and identifying new therapies. Here, we apply deep transcriptomic and accessible chromatin profiling to characterize a faithful ex vivo human erythroid differentiation system from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We reveal stage-specific transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility during various stages of erythropoiesis, including 14,260 differentially expressed genes and 63,659 variably accessible chromatin peaks. Our analysis suggests differentiation stage-predominant roles for specific master regulators, including GATA1 and KLF1. We integrate chromatin profiles with common and rare genetic variants associated with erythroid cell traits and diseases, finding that variants regulating different erythroid phenotypes likely act at variable points during differentiation. In addition, we identify a regulator of terminal erythropoiesis, TMCC2, more broadly illustrating the value of this comprehensive analysis to improve our understanding of erythropoiesis in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Senescence is a cellular phenotype present in health and disease, characterized by a stable cell-cycle arrest and an inflammatory response called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP is important in influencing the behavior of neighboring cells and altering the microenvironment; yet, this role has been mainly attributed to soluble factors. Here, we show that both the soluble factors and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are capable of transmitting paracrine senescence to nearby cells. Analysis of individual cells internalizing sEVs, using a Cre-reporter system, show a positive correlation between sEV uptake and senescence activation. We find an increase in the number of multivesicular bodies during senescence in vivo. sEV protein characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) followed by a functional siRNA screen identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as being partially responsible for transmitting senescence to normal cells. We find that sEVs contribute to paracrine senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil granule serine proteases contribute to immune responses through cleavage of microbial toxins and structural proteins. They induce tissue damage and modulate inflammation if levels exceed their inhibitors. Here, we show that the intracellular protease inhibitors Serpinb1a and Serpinb6a contribute to monocyte and neutrophil survival in steady-state and inflammatory settings by inhibiting cathepsin G (CatG). Importantly, we found that CatG efficiently cleaved gasdermin D (GSDMD) to generate the signature N-terminal domain GSDMD-p30 known to induce pyroptosis. Yet GSDMD deletion did not rescue neutrophil survival in Sb1a.Sb6a−/− mice. Furthermore, Sb1a.Sb6a−/− mice released high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon endotoxin challenge in vivo in a CatG-dependent manner. Canonical inflammasome activation in Sb1a.Sb6a−/− macrophages showed increased IL-1β release that was dependent on CatG and GSDMD. Together, our findings demonstrate that cytosolic serpins expressed in myeloid cells prevent cell death and regulate inflammatory responses by inhibiting CatG and alternative activation of GSDMD.

Abstract: Summary
Twenty percent of breast cancer (BC) patients develop distant metastasis for which there is no cure. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in the tumor microenvironment were shown to stimulate metastasis, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identified and quantified cancer cells engulfing stromal cells in clinical samples of BC metastasis by dual immunostaining for EZH2 and ALDH1 expression. Using flow cytometry and a microfluidic single-cell paring and retrieval platform, we show that MSC engulfment capacity is associated with BC cell metastatic potential and generates cells with mesenchymal-like, invasion, and stem cell traits. Whole-transcriptome analyses of selectively retrieved engulfing BC cells identify a gene signature of MSC engulfment consisting of WNT5A, MSR1, ELMO1, IL1RL2, ZPLD1, and SIRPB1. These results delineate a mechanism by which MSCs in the tumor microenvironment promote metastasis and provide a microfluidic platform with the potential to predict BC metastasis in clinical samples.

Abstract: Summary
Stabilizing gaze and position within an environment constitutes an important task for the nervous system of many animals. The optomotor response (OMR) is a reflexive behavior, present across many species, in which animals move in the direction of perceived whole-field visual motion, therefore stabilizing themselves with respect to the visual environment. Although the OMR has been extensively used to probe visuomotor neuronal circuitry, the exact visual cues that elicit the behavior remain unidentified. In this study, we use larval zebrafish to identify spatiotemporal visual features that robustly elicit forward OMR swimming. These cues consist of a local, forward-moving, off edge together with on/off symmetric, similarly directed, global motion. Imaging experiments reveal neural units specifically activated by the forward-moving light-dark transition. We conclude that the OMR is driven not just by whole-field motion but by the interplay between global and local visual stimuli, where the latter exhibits a strong light-dark asymmetry.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity is linked to impaired movement in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The autonomous firing of STN neurons, which contributes to their tonic excitation of the extrastriatal basal ganglia and shapes their integration of synaptic input, is downregulated in PD models. Using electrophysiological, chemogenetic, genetic, and optical approaches, we find that chemogenetic activation of indirect pathway striatopallidal neurons downregulates intrinsic STN activity in normal mice but this effect is occluded in Parkinsonian mice. Loss of autonomous spiking in PD mice is prevented by STN N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) knockdown and reversed by reactive oxygen species breakdown or KATP channel inhibition. Chemogenetic activation of hM3D(Gq) in STN neurons in Parkinsonian mice rescues their intrinsic activity, modifies their synaptic integration, and ameliorates motor dysfunction. Together these data argue that in PD mice increased indirect pathway activity leads to disinhibition of the STN, which triggers maladaptive NMDAR-dependent downregulation of autonomous firing.

Abstract: Voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) is generally believed to be active only in excitable cells. However, we have reported recently that N-type VDCC (Cav2.2) could become functional in non-excitable cells under pathological conditions. In the present study, we show that Cav2.2 channels are also functional in physiological microglial activation process. By using a mouse microglial cell line (MG6), we examined the effects of a Cav2.2 blocker on the activation of MG6 cells, when treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) / interferon γ (IFNγ) or with interleukin-4 (IL-4). As a result, blocking the activation of Cav2.2 enhanced so-called alternative activation process of microglia (transition to neuroprotective M2 microglia) without changing the efficacy of the transition to neuroinflammatory M1 microglia. This enhanced M2 transition involved the activation of a transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 2 (HIF-2), since a specific blocker of HIF-2 completely abolished this enhancement. We then examined whether Cav2.2 activation was involved in aging-related neuroinflammation. Using primary culture of microglia, we found that the efficacy of microglial M1 transition was enhanced but that M2 transition was reduced by aging, in agreement with a general notion that aging induces enhanced neuroinflammation. Finally, we show here that the moderate blockade of Cav2.2 expression in microglia restores this age-dependent reduction of microglial M2 transition and reduces the aging-induced exaggerated cytokine response, as revealed by a fast recovery from depressive-like behaviors in microglia-specific Cav2.2 deficient mice. These results suggest a critical role for microglial Cav2.2 channel in the aging-related neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of Gαq-coupled receptors by inflammatory mediators inhibits cold-sensing TRPM8 channels, aggravating pain and inflammation. Both Gαq and the downstream hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) inhibit TRPM8. Here, I demonstrate that direct Gαq gating is essential for both the basal cold sensitivity of TRPM8 and TRPM8 inhibition elicited by bradykinin in sensory neurons. The action of Gαq depends on binding to three arginine residues in the N terminus of TRPM8. Neutralization of these residues markedly increased sensitivity of the channel to agonist and membrane voltage and completely abolished TRPM8 inhibition by both Gαq and bradykinin while sparing the channel sensitivity to PIP2. Interestingly, the bradykinin receptor B2R also binds to TRPM8, rendering TRPM8 insensitive to PIP2 depletion. Furthermore, TRPM8-Gαq binding impaired Gαq coupling and signaling to PLCβ-PIP2. The crosstalk in the TRPM8-Gαq-B2R complex thus determines Gαq gating rather than PIP2 as a sole means of TRPM8 inhibition by bradykinin.

Abstract: Summary
Several phage-tail-like nanomachines were shown to play an important role in the interactions between bacteria and their eukaryotic hosts. These apparatuses appear to represent a new injection paradigm. Here, with three verified extracellular contractile injection systems (eCISs), a protein profile and genomic context-based iterative approach was applied to identify 631 eCIS-like loci from the 11,699 publicly available complete bacterial genomes. The eCIS superfamily, which is phylogenetically diverse and sub-divided into six families, is distributed among Gram-negative and -positive bacteria in addition to archaea. Our results show that very few bacteria are seen to possess intact operons of both eCIS and type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). An open access online database of all detected eCIS-like loci is presented to facilitate future studies. The presence of this bacterial injection machine in a multitude of organisms suggests that it may play an important ecological role in the life cycles of many bacteria.

Abstract: S100 proteins constitute a large subfamily of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium binding proteins. They possess one classical EF-hand Ca2+-binding domain and an atypical EF-hand domain. Most of the S100 proteins form stable symmetric homodimers. An analysis of literature data on S100 proteins showed that their physiological concentrations could be much lower than dissociation constants of their dimeric forms. It means that just monomeric forms of these proteins are important for their functioning. In the present work, thermal denaturation of apo-S100P protein monitored by intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence has been studied at various protein concentrations within the region from 0.04–10 μM. A transition from the dimeric to monomeric form results in a decrease in protein thermal stability shifting the mid-transition temperature from 85 to 75 °C. Monomeric S100P immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip of a surface plasmon resonance instrument forms calcium dependent 1 to 1 complexes with human interleukin-11 (equilibrium dissociation constant 1.2 nM). In contrast, immobilized interleukin-11 binds two molecules of dimeric S100P with dissociation constants of 32 nM and 288 nM. Since effective dissociation constant of dimeric S100P protein is very low (0.5 μM as evaluated from our data) the sensitivity of the existing physical methods does not allow carrying out a detailed study of S100P monomer properties. For this reason, we have used molecular dynamics methods to evaluate structural changes in S100P upon its transition from the dimeric to monomeric state. 80-ns molecular dynamics simulations of kinetics of formation of S100P, S100B and S100A11 monomers from the corresponding dimers have been carried out. It was found that during the transition from the homo-dimer to monomer form, the three S100 monomer structures undergo the following changes: (1) the helices in the four-helix bundles within each monomer rotate in order to shield the exposed non-polar residues; (2) almost all lost contacts at the dimer interface are substituted with equivalent and newly formed interactions inside each monomer, and new stabilizing interactions are formed; and (3) all monomers recreate functional hydrophobic cores. The results of the present study show that both dimeric and monomeric forms of S100 proteins can be functional.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complexes associated with an ATPase (either SMARCA4 or SMARCA2). Heterozygous mutations in the SMARCA2 ATPase cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), an intellectual disability syndrome associated with delayed speech onset. We engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to carry NCBRS-associated heterozygous SMARCA2 K755R or R1159Q mutations. While SMARCA2 mutant hESCs were phenotypically normal, differentiation to neural progenitors cells (NPCs) was severely impaired. We find that SMARCA2 mutations cause enhancer reorganization with loss of SOX3-dependent neural enhancers and prominent emergence of astrocyte-specific de novo enhancers. Changes in chromatin accessibility at enhancers were associated with an increase in SMARCA2 binding and retargeting of SMARCA4. We show that the AP-1 family member FRA2 is aberrantly overexpressed in SMARCA2 mutant NPCs, where it functions as a pioneer factor at de novo enhancers. Together, our results demonstrate that SMARCA2 mutations cause impaired differentiation through enhancer reprogramming via inappropriate targeting of SMARCA4.

Abstract: Summary
Human genetic variants in SLC16A11 are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We previously identified two distinct mechanisms through which co-inherited T2D-risk coding and non-coding variants disrupt SLC16A11 expression and activity, thus implicating reduced SLC16A11 function as the disease-relevant direction of effect. In a recent publication, Zhao et al. (2019a) argue that human SLC16A11 coding variants confer gain of function, basing their conclusions on phenotypic changes observed following overexpression of mutant murine Slc16a11. However, data necessary to demonstrate gain-of-function activity are not reported. Furthermore, several fundamental flaws in their experimental system—including inaccurate modeling of the human variant haplotype and expression conditions that are not physiologically relevant—prevent conclusions about T2D-risk variant effects on human physiology. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Zhao et al. (2019a), published in Cell Reports. See also the response by Zhao et al. (2019b) in this issue of Cell Reports.

Abstract: Summary
Melanoma is the deadliest skin cancer due to its high rate of metastasis, frequently to the brain. Brain metastases are incurable; therefore, understanding melanoma brain metastasis is of great clinical importance. We used a mouse model of spontaneous melanoma brain metastasis to study the interactions of melanomas with the brain microenvironment. We find that CXCL10 is upregulated in metastasis-associated astrocytes in mice and humans and is functionally important for the chemoattraction of melanoma cells. Moreover, CXCR3, the receptor for CXCL10, is upregulated in brain-tropic melanoma cells. Targeting melanoma expression of CXCR3 by nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery or by shRNA transduction inhibits melanoma cell migration and attenuates brain metastasis in vivo. These findings suggest that the instigation of pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes is hijacked by brain-metastasizing tumor cells to promote their metastatic capacity and that the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis may be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of melanoma brain metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive microglia are a major pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact role of microglia in AD pathogenesis is still unclear. Here, using metabolic profiling, we found that exposure to amyloid-β triggers acute microglial inflammation accompanied by metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. It was dependent on the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway. However, once activated, microglia reached a chronic tolerant phase as a result of broad defects in energy metabolisms and subsequently diminished immune responses, including cytokine secretion and phagocytosis. Using genome-wide RNA sequencing and multiphoton microscopy techniques, we further identified metabolically defective microglia in 5XFAD mice, an AD mouse model. Finally, we showed that metabolic boosting with recombinant interferon-γ treatment reversed the defective glycolytic metabolism and inflammatory functions of microglia, thereby mitigating the AD pathology of 5XFAD mice. Collectively, metabolic reprogramming is crucial for microglial functions in AD, and modulating metabolism might be a new therapeutic strategy for AD.

Abstract: Summary
Presynaptic endosomes reportedly participate in synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling. However, it remains unclear whether they differentially regulate SV biogenesis and synaptic transmission in different types of synapses and how they are implicated in diseases. Using cryo-electron tomography and endocytic tracing, we uncover different endocytic modes and dynamics associated with distinct SV morphology between glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. We further find that cathepsin D (CatD), a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) protein, is selectively located in GABAergic presynaptic endosomes. Inactivation of CatD results in enlarged presynaptic endosomes, reduces the readily releasable pool, and impairs synaptic transmission in GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, synapses. Moreover, CatD-deficient mice exhibit hyperactivity and increased sensitivity to seizure, mimicking epileptic behavior in CatD-related LSD patients. These data reveal an important role for presynaptic endosomal CatD in regulating GABAergic SV biogenesis and provide mechanistic insights for understanding the synaptic pathology and behavioral defects in CatD-associated LSD.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been genetically linked to mutations in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including FUS. Here, we report the RNA interactome of wild-type and mutant FUS in human motor neurons (MNs). This analysis identified a number of RNA targets. Whereas the wild-type protein preferentially binds introns, the ALS mutation causes a shift toward 3′ UTRs. Neural ELAV-like RBPs are among mutant FUS targets. As a result, ELAVL4 protein levels are increased in mutant MNs. ELAVL4 and mutant FUS interact and co-localize in cytoplasmic speckles with altered biomechanical properties. Upon oxidative stress, ELAVL4 and mutant FUS are engaged in stress granules. In the spinal cord of FUS ALS patients, ELAVL4 represents a neural-specific component of FUS-positive cytoplasmic aggregates, whereas in sporadic patients it co-localizes with phosphorylated TDP-43-positive inclusions. We propose that pathological mutations in FUS trigger an aberrant crosstalk with ELAVL4 with implications for ALS.

Abstract: Summary
CD8+ T cell expansions and functions rely on glycolysis, but the mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell glycolytic metabolism remain elusive. Here, we show that acylglycerol kinase (AGK) is required for the establishment and maintenance of CD8+ T cell metabolic and functional fitness. AGK deficiency dampens CD8+ T cell antitumor functions in vivo and perturbs CD8+ T cell proliferation in vitro. Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which mediates elevated CD8+ T cell glycolysis, is tightly dependent on AGK kinase activity. Mechanistically, T cell antigen receptor (TCR)- and CD28-stimulated recruitment of PTEN to the plasma membrane facilitates AGK-PTEN interaction and AGK-triggered PTEN phosphorylation, thereby restricting PTEN phosphatase activity in CD8+ T cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that AGK maintains CD8+ T cell metabolic and functional state by restraining PTEN activity and highlight a critical role for AGK in CD8+ T cell metabolic programming and effector function.

Abstract: Summary
An excess of glucocorticoids leads to the development of obesity in both mice and humans, but the mechanism for this is unknown. Here, we determine the extent to which decreased BAT thermogenic capacity (as a result of glucocorticoid treatment) contributes to the development of obesity. Contrary to previous suggestions, we show that only in mice housed at thermoneutrality (30°C) does corticosterone treatment reduce total BAT UCP1 protein. This reduction is reflected in reduced brown adipocyte cellular and mitochondrial UCP1-dependent respiration. However, glucocorticoid-induced obesity develops to the same extent in animals housed at 21°C and 30°C, whereas total BAT UCP1 protein levels differ 100-fold between the two groups. In corticosterone-treated wild-type and UCP1 knockout mice housed at 30°C, obesity also develops to the same extent. Thus, our results demonstrate that the development of glucocorticoid-induced obesity is not caused by a decreased UCP1-dependent thermogenic capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes constantly adapt their ramified morphology in order to support brain cell assemblies. Such plasticity is partly mediated by ion and water fluxes, which rely on the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). The mechanism by which this channel locally contributes to process dynamics has remained elusive. Using a combination of single-molecule and calcium imaging approaches, we here investigated in hippocampal astrocytes the dynamic distribution of the AQP4 isoforms M1 and M23. Surface AQP4-M1 formed small aggregates that contrast with the large AQP4-M23 clusters that are enriched near glutamatergic synapses. Strikingly, stabilizing surface AQP4-M23 tuned the motility of astrocyte processes and favors glutamate synapse activity. Furthermore, human autoantibodies directed against AQP4 from neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients impaired AQP4-M23 dynamic distribution and, consequently, astrocyte process and synaptic activity. Collectively, it emerges that the membrane dynamics of AQP4 isoform regulate brain cell assemblies in health and autoimmune brain disease targeting AQP4.

Targeted and Persistent 8-Oxoguanine Base Damage at Telomeres Promotes Telomere Loss and Crisis,

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres are essential for genome stability. Oxidative stress caused by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accelerates telomere shortening. Although telomeres are hypersensitive to ROS-mediated 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) formation, the biological effect of this common lesion at telomeres is poorly understood because ROS have pleiotropic effects. Here we developed a chemoptogenetic tool that selectively produces 8-oxoG only at telomeres. Acute telomeric 8-oxoG formation increased telomere fragility in cells lacking OGG1, the enzyme that removes 8-oxoG, but did not compromise cell survival. However, chronic telomeric 8-oxoG induction over time shortens telomeres and impairs cell growth. Accumulation of telomeric 8-oxoG in chronically exposed OGG1-deficient cells triggers replication stress, as evidenced by mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, and significantly increases telomere losses. These losses generate chromosome fusions, leading to chromatin bridges and micronucleus formation upon cell division. By confining base damage to the telomeres, we show that telomeric 8-oxoG accumulation directly drives telomere crisis.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis involves RNA folding and processing that depend on assembly factors and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). The 90S (SSU-processome) is the earliest pre-ribosome structurally analyzed, which was suggested to assemble stepwise along the growing pre-rRNA from 5′ > 3′, but this directionality may not be accurate. Here, by analyzing the structure of a series of 90S assembly intermediates from Chaetomium thermophilum, we discover a reverse order of 18S rRNA subdomain incorporation. Large parts of the 18S rRNA 3′ and central domains assemble first into the 90S before the 5′ domain is integrated. This final incorporation depends on a contact between a heterotrimer Enp2-Bfr2-Lcp5 recruited to the flexible 5′ domain and Kre33, which reconstitutes the Kre33-Enp-Brf2-Lcp5 module on the compacted 90S. Keeping the 5′ domain temporarily segregated from the 90S scaffold could provide extra time to complete the multifaceted 5′ domain folding, which depends on a distinct set of snoRNAs and processing factors.

Abstract: Summary
Telomerase biogenesis is a complex process where several steps remain poorly understood. Single-strand-selective uracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) associates with the DKC1-containing H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, which is essential for telomerase biogenesis. Herein, we show that SMUG1 interacts with the telomeric RNA component (hTERC) and is required for co-transcriptional processing of the nascent transcript into mature hTERC. We demonstrate that SMUG1 regulates the presence of base modifications in hTERC, in a region between the CR4/CR5 domain and the H box. Increased levels of hTERC base modifications are accompanied by reduced DKC1 binding. Loss of SMUG1 leads to an imbalance between mature hTERC and its processing intermediates, leading to the accumulation of 3′-polyadenylated and 3′-extended intermediates that are degraded in an EXOSC10-independent RNA degradation pathway. Consequently, SMUG1-deprived cells exhibit telomerase deficiency, leading to impaired bone marrow proliferation in Smug1-knockout mice.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), critical for host defense and tumor surveillance, requires tight control of its expression. Multiple cis-regulatory elements exist around Ifng along with a non-coding transcript, Ifng-as1 (also termed NeST). Here, we describe two genetic models generated to dissect the molecular functions of this locus and its RNA product. DNA deletion within the Ifng-as1 locus disrupted chromatin organization of the extended Ifng locus, impaired Ifng response, and compromised host defense. Insertion of a polyA signal ablated the Ifng-as1 full-length transcript and impaired host defense, while allowing proper chromatin structure. Transient knockdown of Ifng-as1 also reduced IFN-γ production. In humans, discordant expression of IFNG and IFNG-AS1 was evident in memory T cells, with high expression of this long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and low expression of the cytokine. These results establish Ifng-as1 as an important regulator of Ifng expression, as a DNA element and transcribed RNA, involved in dynamic and cell state-specific responses to infection.

Abstract: Summary
Vaccines have revolutionized public health, preventing millions of deaths each year, particularly in childhood. Yet, there is considerable variability in the magnitude and persistence of vaccine-induced immunity. Maintenance of specific antibody is essential for continuity of vaccine-induced serological protection. We conducted a genome-wide association study into the persistence of immunity to three childhood vaccines: capsular group C meningococcal (MenC), Haemophilus influenzae type b, and tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccines. We detail associations between variants in a locus containing a family of signal-regulatory proteins and the persistence MenC immunity. We postulate a regulatory role for the lead SNP, with supporting epigenetic and expression quantitative trait loci data. Furthermore, we define associations between SNPs in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and the persistence of TT-specific immunity. Moreover, we describe four classical HLA alleles, HLA DRB1∗0301, HLA DQB1∗0201, HLA DQB1∗0602, and HLA DRB1∗1501, associated with TT-specific immunity, independent of the lead SNP association.
