Abstract: Methylglyoxal (MG) is a by-product of glucose metabolism and its accumulation has been linked to the development of diabetic complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy by affecting multiple signalling pathways. However, its influence on the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and particularly Ca2+ entry, which has been reported to be mediated via TRPA1 channels in DRG neurons, has not been studied in much detail in other cell types. In this study, we report the consequences of acute and long-term MG application on intracellular Ca2+ levels in endothelial cells. We showed that acute MG application doesn’t evoke any instantaneous changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in immortalized mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCECs) and murine microvascular endothelial cells (muMECs). In contrast, an MG-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ level was observed in primary mouse mesangial cells within 30 s, indicating that the modulation of Ca2+ homeostasis by MG is strictly cell type specific. The formation of the MG-derived advanced glycation end product (AGE) MG-H1 was found to be time and concentration-dependent in MCECs. Likewise, MG pre-incubation for 6 h increased the angiotensin II-evoked Ca2+ entry in MCECs and muMECs which was abrogated by inhibition of Calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels with GSK-7975A, but unaffected by an inhibitor specific to TRPA1 channels. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that MG pre-treatment did not affect expression of the genes encoding the angiotensin receptors AT1R (Agtr 1a & Agtr 1b), Trpa1 nor Orai1, Orai2, Orai3, Stim1, Stim2 and Saraf which operate as constituents or regulators of CRAC channels and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in other cell types. Together, our results show that long-term MG stimulation leads to the formation of glycation end products, which facilitates the agonist-evoked Ca2+ entry in endothelial cells, and this could be a new pathway that might lead to MG-evoked vasoregression observed in diabetic vasculopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Increased glycolysis parallels immune cell activation, but the role of pyruvate remains largely unexplored. We found that stimulation of dendritic cells with the fungal surrogate zymosan causes decreases of pyruvate, citrate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate, while increasing oxaloacetate, succinate, lactate, oxygen consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Expression of IL10 and IL23A (the gene encoding the p19 chain of IL-23) depended on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Mechanistically, pyruvate reinforced histone H3 acetylation, and acetate rescued the effect of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition, most likely because it is a substrate of the acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACSS2. Mice lacking the receptor of the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) showed reduced production of IL-10 and IL-23 that is explained by the requirement of acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis and its ensuing autocrine function. Acetyl-CoA therefore intertwines fatty acid remodeling of glycerophospholipids and energetic metabolism during cytokine induction.

Abstract: Summary
Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA binding protein involved in regulating many aspects of RNA processing and linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. Transcriptomics studies indicate that FUS binds a large variety of RNA motifs, suggesting that FUS RNA binding might be quite complex. Here, we present solution structures of FUS zinc finger (ZnF) and RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains bound to RNA. These structures show a bipartite binding mode of FUS comprising of sequence-specific recognition of a NGGU motif via the ZnF and an unusual shape recognition of a stem-loop RNA via the RRM. In addition, sequence-independent interactions via the RGG repeats significantly increase binding affinity and promote destabilization of structured RNA conformation, enabling additional binding. We further show that disruption of the RRM and ZnF domains abolishes FUS function in splicing. Altogether, our results rationalize why deciphering the RNA binding mode of FUS has been so challenging.

Abstract: Summary
The roles of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and circulating monocytes in human cancer are poorly understood. Here, we show that monocyte subpopulation distribution and transcriptomes are significantly altered by the presence of endometrial and breast cancer. Furthermore, TAMs from endometrial and breast cancers are transcriptionally distinct from monocytes and their respective tissue-resident macrophages. We identified a breast TAM signature that is highly enriched in aggressive breast cancer subtypes and associated with shorter disease-specific survival. We also identified an auto-regulatory loop between TAMs and cancer cells driven by tumor necrosis factor alpha involving SIGLEC1 and CCL8, which is self-reinforcing through the production of CSF1. Together these data provide direct evidence that monocyte and macrophage transcriptional landscapes are perturbed by cancer, reflecting patient outcomes.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-specific protease 44 (USP44) has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis across various tumors. However, the function of USP44 in prostate cancers and regulatory mechanism of histone-modifying enzymes by USP44 in tumors is not well-understood. Here, we found that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase, is regulated by USP44. We showed that EZH2 is a novel target of USP44 and that the protein stability of EZH2 is upregulated by USP44-mediated deubiquitination. In USP44 knockdown prostate cancer cells, the EZH2 protein level and its gene silencing activity were decreased. Furthermore, USP44 knockdown inhibited the tumorigenic characteristics and cancer stem cell-like behaviors of prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of tumorigenesis caused by USP44 knockdown was recovered by ectopic introduction of EZH2. Additionally, USP44 regulates the protein stability of oncogenic EZH2 mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that USP44 promotes the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells partly by stabilizing EZH2 and that USP44 is a viable therapeutic target for treating EZH2-dependent cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism plays a critical role in kidneys. We previously reported that decreased secretion of a NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), from proximal tubules (PTs) can trigger diabetic albuminuria. In the present study, we investigated the role of NMN-producing enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) in diabetic nephropathy. The expression of Nampt in PTs was downregulated in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic mice when they exhibited albuminuria. This albuminuria was ameliorated in PT-specific Nampt-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice. PT-specific Nampt-conditional knockout (Nampt CKO) mice exhibited TBM thickening and collagen deposition, which were associated with the upregulation of the profibrogenic gene TIMP-1. Nampt CKO mice also exhibited the downregulation of sirtuins, particularly in Sirt6. PT-specific Sirt6-knockout mice exhibited enhanced fibrotic phenotype resembling that of Nampt CKO mice with increased Timp1 expression. In conclusion, the Nampt-Sirt6 axis in PTs serves as a key player in fibrogenic extracellular matrix remodeling in diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are bulky lesions that interfere with DNA metabolism and therefore threaten genomic integrity. Recent studies implicate the metalloprotease SPRTN in S phase removal of DPCs, but how SPRTN is targeted to DPCs during DNA replication is unknown. Using Xenopus egg extracts that recapitulate replication-coupled DPC proteolysis, we show that DPCs can be degraded by SPRTN or the proteasome, which act as independent DPC proteases. Proteasome recruitment requires DPC polyubiquitylation, which is partially dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAIP. In contrast, SPRTN-mediated DPC degradation does not require DPC polyubiquitylation but instead depends on nascent strand extension to within a few nucleotides of the lesion, implying that polymerase stalling at the DPC activates SPRTN on both leading and lagging strand templates. Our results demonstrate that SPRTN and proteasome activities are coupled to DNA replication by distinct mechanisms that promote replication across immovable protein barriers.

Abstract: Summary
To understand how the interaction between an intracellular bacterium and the host immune system contributes to outcome at the site of infection, we studied leprosy, a disease that forms a clinical spectrum, in which progressive infection by the intracellular bacterium Mycobacterium leprae is characterized by the production of type I IFNs and antibody production. Dual RNA-seq on patient lesions identifies two independent molecular measures of M. leprae, each of which correlates with distinct aspects of the host immune response. The fraction of bacterial transcripts, reflecting bacterial burden, correlates with a host type I IFN gene signature, known to inhibit antimicrobial responses. Second, the bacterial mRNA:rRNA ratio, reflecting bacterial viability, links bacterial heat shock proteins with the BAFF-BCMA host antibody response pathway. Our findings provide a platform for the interrogation of host and pathogen transcriptomes at the site of infection, allowing insight into mechanisms of inflammation in human disease.

Abstract: Summary
The use of alternative translation initiation sites enables production of more than one protein from a single gene, thereby expanding the cellular proteome. Although several such examples have been serendipitously found in bacteria, genome-wide mapping of alternative translation start sites has been unattainable. We found that the antibiotic retapamulin specifically arrests initiating ribosomes at start codons of the genes. Retapamulin-enhanced Ribo-seq analysis (Ribo-RET) not only allowed mapping of conventional initiation sites at the beginning of the genes, but strikingly, it also revealed putative internal start sites in a number of Escherichia coli genes. Experiments demonstrated that the internal start codons can be recognized by the ribosomes and direct translation initiation in vitro and in vivo. Proteins, whose synthesis is initiated at internal in-frame and out-of-frame start sites, can be functionally important and contribute to the “alternative” bacterial proteome. The internal start sites may also play regulatory roles in gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Developing and adult tissues use different cis-regulatory elements. Although DNA at some decommissioned embryonic enhancers is hypomethylated in adult cells, it is unknown whether this putative epigenetic memory is complete and recoverable. We find that, in adult mouse cells, hypomethylated CpG dinucleotides preserve a nearly complete archive of tissue-specific developmental enhancers. Sites that carry the active histone mark H3K4me1, and are therefore considered “primed,” are mainly cis elements that act late in organogenesis. In contrast, sites decommissioned early in development retain hypomethylated DNA as a singular property. In adult intestinal and blood cells, sustained absence of polycomb repressive complex 2 indirectly reactivates most—and only—hypomethylated developmental enhancers. Embryonic and fetal transcriptional programs re-emerge as a result, in reverse chronology to cis element inactivation during development. Thus, hypomethylated DNA in adult cells preserves a “fossil record” of tissue-specific developmental enhancers, stably marking decommissioned sites and enabling recovery of this epigenetic memory.

Abstract: Summary
Conditions of metabolic stress dysregulate the NAD metabolome. By restoring NAD, nicotinamide riboside (NR) provides resistance to such conditions. We tested the hypotheses that postpartum might dysregulate maternal NAD and that increasing systemic NAD with NR might benefit mothers and offspring. In postpartum mothers, the liver NAD metabolome is depressed while blood increases circulation of NAD metabolites to enable a >20-fold increase in mammary NAD+ and NADP+. Lactation and NR synergize in stimulating prolactin synthesis and mammary biosynthetic programs. NR supplementation of new mothers increases lactation and nursing behaviors and stimulates maternal transmission of macronutrients, micronutrients, and BDNF into milk. Pups of NR-supplemented mothers are advantaged in glycemic control, size at weaning, and synaptic pruning. Adult offspring of mothers supplemented during nursing retain advantages in physical performance, anti-anxiety, spatial memory, delayed onset of behavioral immobility, and promotion of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, postgestational maternal micronutrition confers lasting advantages to offspring.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate meiotic chromosome segregation critically depends on the formation of inter-homolog crossovers initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs). Inaccuracies in this process can drive aneuploidy and developmental defects, but how meiotic cells are protected from unscheduled DNA breaks remains unexplored. Here we define a checkpoint response to persistent meiotic DSBs in C. elegans that phosphorylates the synaptonemal complex (SC) to switch repair partner from the homolog to the sister chromatid. A key target of this response is the core SC component SYP-1, which is phosphorylated in response to ionizing radiation (IR) or unrepaired meiotic DSBs. Failure to phosphorylate (syp-16A) or dephosphorylate (syp-16D) SYP-1 in response to DNA damage results in chromosome non-dysjunction, hyper-sensitivity to IR-induced DSBs, and synthetic lethality with loss of brc-1BRCA1. Since BRC-1 is required for inter-sister repair, these observations reveal that checkpoint-dependent SYP-1 phosphorylation safeguards the germline against persistent meiotic DSBs by channelling repair to the sister chromatid.

Abstract: Summary
Replication-dependent histone genes often reside in tandemly arrayed gene clusters, hindering systematic loss-of-function analyses. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and the attP/attB double-integration system to alter numbers and sequences of histone genes in their original genomic context in Drosophila melanogaster. As few as 8 copies of the histone gene unit supported embryo development and adult viability, whereas flies with 20 copies were indistinguishable from wild-types. By hierarchical assembly, 40 alanine-substitution mutations (covering all known modified residues in histones H3 and H4) were introduced and characterized. Mutations at multiple residues compromised viability, fertility, and DNA-damage responses. In particular, H4K16 was necessary for expression of male X-linked genes, male viability, and maintenance of ovarian germline stem cells, whereas H3K27 was essential for late embryogenesis. Simplified mosaic analysis showed that H3R26 is required for H3K27 trimethylation. We have developed a powerful strategy and valuable reagents to systematically probe histone functions in D. melanogaster.

Abstract: Summary
Global investigation of histone marks in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains limited. Analyses of 38 AML samples through integrated transcriptional and chromatin mark analysis exposes 2 major subtypes. One subtype is dominated by patients with NPM1 mutations or MLL-fusion genes, shows activation of the regulatory pathways involving HOX-family genes as targets, and displays high self-renewal capacity and stemness. The second subtype is enriched for RUNX1 or spliceosome mutations, suggesting potential interplay between the 2 aberrations, and mainly depends on IRF family regulators. Cellular consequences in prognosis predict a relatively worse outcome for the first subtype. Our integrated profiling establishes a rich resource to probe AML subtypes on the basis of expression and chromatin data.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of cell-surface markers specific to human pancreatic β cells would allow in vivo analysis and imaging. Here we introduce a biomarker, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-3 (NTPDase3), that is expressed on the cell surface of essentially all adult human β cells, including those from individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. NTPDase3 is expressed dynamically during postnatal human pancreas development, appearing first in acinar cells at birth, but several months later its expression declines in acinar cells while concurrently emerging in islet β cells. Given its specificity and membrane localization, we utilized an NTPDase3 antibody for purification of live human β cells as confirmed by transcriptional profiling, and, in addition, for in vivo imaging of transplanted human β cells. Thus, NTPDase3 is a cell-surface biomarker of adult human β cells, and the antibody directed to this protein should be a useful new reagent for β cell sorting, in vivo imaging, and targeting.

Abstract: Animals need to be able to alter their developmental and behavioral programs in response to changing environmental conditions. This developmental and behavioral plasticity is mainly mediated by changes in gene expression. The knowledge of the mechanisms by which environmental signals are transduced and integrated to modulate changes in sensory gene expression is limited. Exposure to ascaroside pheromone has been reported to alter the expression of a subset of putative G protein-coupled chemosensory receptor genes in the ASI chemosensory neurons of C. elegans (Kim et al., 2009; Nolan et al., 2002; Peckol et al., 1999). Here we show that ascaroside pheromone reversibly represses expression of the str-3 chemoreceptor gene in the ASI neurons. Repression of str-3 expression can be initiated only at the L1 stage, but expression is restored upon removal of ascarosides at any developmental stage. Pheromone receptors including SRBC-64/66 and SRG-36/37 are required for str-3 repression. Moreover, pheromone-mediated str-3 repression is mediated by FLP-18 neuropeptide signaling via the NPR-1 neuropeptide receptor. These results suggest that environmental signals regulate chemosensory gene expression together with internal neuropeptide signals which, in turn, modulate behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Self-renewal and pluripotency of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state are established and maintained by multiple regulatory networks that comprise transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. While much has been learned regarding transcription factors, the function of epigenetic regulators in these networks is less well defined. We conducted a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss-of-function genetic screen that identified two epigenetic regulators, TAF5L and TAF6L, components or co-activators of the GNAT-HAT complexes for the mouse ESC (mESC) state. Detailed molecular studies demonstrate that TAF5L/TAF6L transcriptionally activate c-Myc and Oct4 and their corresponding MYC and CORE regulatory networks. Besides, TAF5L/TAF6L predominantly regulate their target genes through H3K9ac deposition and c-MYC recruitment that eventually activate the MYC regulatory network for self-renewal of mESCs. Thus, our findings uncover a role of TAF5L/TAF6L in directing the MYC regulatory network that orchestrates gene expression programs to control self-renewal for the maintenance of mESC state.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence supports the role of the DNA damage response (DDR) in the negative regulation of tumorigenesis. Here, we found that DDR signaling poises a series of epigenetic events, resulting in activation of pro-tumorigenic genes but can go as far as reactivation of the pluripotency gene OCT4. Loss of DNA methylation appears to be a key initiating event in DDR-dependent OCT4 locus reactivation although full reactivation required the presence of a driving oncogene, such as Myc and macroH2A downregulation. Using genetic-lineage-tracing experiments and an in situ labeling approach, we show that DDR-induced epigenetic reactivation of OCT4 regulates the resistance to chemotherapy and contributes to tumor relapse both in mouse and primary human cancers. In turn, deletion of OCT4 reverses chemoresistance and delays the relapse. Here, we uncovered an unexpected tumor-promoting role of DDR in cancer cell reprogramming, providing novel therapeutic entry points for cancer intervention strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are common birth defects in humans and show an unexplained female bias. Female mice lacking the tumor suppressor p53 display NTDs with incomplete penetrance. We found that the combined loss of pro-apoptotic BIM and p53 caused 100% penetrant, female-exclusive NTDs, which allowed us to investigate the female-specific functions of p53. We report that female p53−/− embryonic neural tube samples show fewer cells with inactive X chromosome markers Xist and H3K27me3 and a concomitant increase in biallelic expression of the X-linked genes, Huwe1 and Usp9x. Decreased Xist and increased X-linked gene expression was confirmed by RNA sequencing. Moreover, we found that p53 directly bound response elements in the X chromosome inactivation center (XIC). Together, these findings suggest p53 directly activates XIC genes, without which there is stochastic failure in X chromosome inactivation, and that X chromosome inactivation failure may underlie the female bias in neural tube closure defects.

Abstract: Summary
Even with sustained antiretroviral therapy, resting CD4+ T cells remain a persistent reservoir of HIV infection, representing a critical barrier to curing HIV. Here, we demonstrate that CD8+ T cells recognize infected, non-activated CD4+ T cells in the absence of de novo protein production, as measured by immune synapse formation, degranulation, cytokine production, and killing of infected cells. Immune recognition is induced by HLA-I presentation of peptides derived from incoming viral particles, and recognition occurred either following cell-free virus infection or following cell-to-cell spread. CD8+ T cells from HIV controllers mediate more effective immune recognition than CD8+ T cells from progressors. These results indicate that non-activated HIV-infected CD4+ T cells can be targeted by CD8+ T cells directly after HIV entry, before reverse transcription, and thus before the establishment of latency, and suggest a mechanism whereby the immune response may reduce the size of the HIV reservoir.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generate a variety of disease-relevant cells that can be used to improve the translation of preclinical research. Despite the potential of hPSCs, their use for genetic screening has been limited by technical challenges. We developed a scalable and renewable Cas9 and sgRNA-hPSC library in which loss-of-function mutations can be induced at will. Our inducible mutant hPSC library can be used for multiple genome-wide CRISPR screens in a variety of hPSC-induced cell types. As proof of concept, we performed three screens for regulators of properties fundamental to hPSCs: their ability to self-renew and/or survive (fitness), their inability to survive as single-cell clones, and their capacity to differentiate. We identified the majority of known genes and pathways involved in these processes, as well as a plethora of genes with unidentified roles. This resource will increase the understanding of human development and genetics. This approach will be a powerful tool to identify disease-modifying genes and pathways.

Abstract: Summary
As tissues develop, they are subjected to a variety of mechanical forces. Some of these forces are instrumental in the development of tissues, while others can result in tissue damage. Despite our extensive understanding of force-guided morphogenesis, we have only a limited understanding of how tissues prevent further morphogenesis once the shape is determined after development. Here, through the development of a tissue-stretching device, we uncover a mechanosensitive pathway that regulates tissue responses to mechanical stress through the polarization of actomyosin across the tissue. We show that stretch induces the formation of linear multicellular actomyosin cables, which depend on Diaphanous for their nucleation. These stiffen the epithelium, limiting further changes in shape, and prevent fractures from propagating across the tissue. Overall, this mechanism of force-induced changes in tissue mechanical properties provides a general model of force buffering that serves to preserve the shape of tissues under conditions of mechanical stress.

Abstract: Summary
In the mouse retina, more than 30 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes have been classified based on a combined metric of morphological and functional characteristics. RGCs arise from a common pool of retinal progenitor cells during embryonic stages and differentiate into mature subtypes in adult retinas. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling formation and maturation of such remarkable cellular diversity remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that T-box transcription factor T-brain 1 (Tbr1) is expressed in two groups of morphologically and functionally distinct RGCs: the orientation-selective J-RGCs and a group of OFF-sustained RGCs with symmetrical dendritic arbors. When Tbr1 is genetically ablated during retinal development, these two RGC groups cannot develop. Ectopically expressing Tbr1 in M4 ipRGCs during development alters dendritic branching and density but not the inner plexiform layer stratification level. Our data indicate that Tbr1 plays critical roles in regulating the formation and dendritic morphogenesis of specific RGC types.

Abstract: Summary
Pleasant taste and nutritional value guide food selection behavior. Here, orosensory features of food may be secondary to its nutritional value in underlying reinforcement, but it is unclear how the brain encodes the reward value of food. Orosensory and peripheral physiological signals may act together on dopaminergic circuits to drive food intake. We combined fMRI and a novel [11C]raclopride PET method to assess systems-level activation and dopamine release in response to palatable food intake in humans. We identified immediate orosensory and delayed post-ingestive dopamine release. Both responses recruit segregated brain regions: specialized integrative pathways and higher cognitive centers. Furthermore, we identified brain areas where dopamine release reflected the subjective desire to eat. Immediate dopamine release in these wanting-related regions was inversely correlated with, and presumably inhibited, post-ingestive release in the dorsal striatum. Our results highlight the role of brain and periphery in interacting to reinforce food intake in humans.

Abstract: Extracellular stimuli evoke a robust increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) throughout the cell to trigger various cellular responses, such as gene expression and apoptosis. This robust expansion of [Ca2+]c is called Ca2+ propagation. To date, it is thought that intracellular second messengers, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and intracellular Ca2+, and clusters of IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) regulate Ca2+ propagation. However, little is known about how the elevation in the [Ca2+]c spreads throughout the cell, especially in non-polar cell, including HeLa cell. In this study, we developed a novel multi lines analysis tool. This tool revealed that the velocity of Ca2+ propagation was inconstant throughout cell and local concentration of intracellular Ca2+ did not contribute to the velocity of Ca2+ propagation. Our results suggest that intracellular Ca2+ propagation is not merely the result of diffusion of intracellular Ca2+, and that, on the contrary, intracellular Ca2+ propagation seems to be regulated by more complicated processes.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomes undergo substantial conformational changes during translation elongation to accommodate incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs and translocate along the mRNA template. We used multiple elongation inhibitors and chemical probing to define ribosome conformational states corresponding to differently sized ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) generated by ribosome profiling. We show, using various genetic and environmental perturbations, that short 20–22 or classical 27–29 nucleotide RPFs correspond to ribosomes with open or occupied ribosomal A sites, respectively. These distinct states of translation elongation are readily discerned by ribosome profiling in all eukaryotes we tested, including fungi, worms, and mammals. This high-resolution ribosome profiling approach reveals mechanisms of translation-elongation arrest during distinct stress conditions. Hyperosmotic stress inhibits translocation through Rck2-dependent eEF2 phosphorylation, whereas oxidative stress traps ribosomes in a pre-translocation state, independent of Rck2-driven eEF2 phosphorylation. These results provide insights and approaches for defining the molecular events that impact translation elongation throughout biology.

Abstract: Summary
β-Catenin-dependent WNT signal transduction governs development, tissue homeostasis, and a vast array of human diseases. Signal propagation through a WNT-Frizzled/LRP receptor complex requires proteins necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Paradoxically, CME also negatively regulates WNT signaling through internalization and degradation of the receptor complex. Here, using a gain-of-function screen of the human kinome, we report that the AP2 associated kinase 1 (AAK1), a known CME enhancer, inhibits WNT signaling. Reciprocally, AAK1 genetic silencing or its pharmacological inhibition using a potent and selective inhibitor activates WNT signaling. Mechanistically, we show that AAK1 promotes clearance of LRP6 from the plasma membrane to suppress the WNT pathway. Time-course experiments support a transcription-uncoupled, WNT-driven negative feedback loop; prolonged WNT treatment drives AAK1-dependent phosphorylation of AP2M1, clathrin-coated pit maturation, and endocytosis of LRP6. We propose that, following WNT receptor activation, increased AAK1 function and CME limits WNT signaling longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by Leishmania parasites is critical for the outcome of leishmaniasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. We investigate the mechanisms involved in NLRP3 activation and demonstrate that caspase-11 (CASP11) is activated in response to infection by Leishmania species and triggers the non-canonical activation of NLRP3. This process accounts for host resistance to infection in macrophages and in vivo. We identify the parasite membrane glycoconjugate lipophosphoglycan (LPG) as the molecule involved in CASP11 activation. Cytosolic delivery of LPG in macrophages triggers CASP11 activation, and infections performed with Lpg1–/– parasites reduce CASP11/NLRP3 activation. Unlike bacterial LPS, purified LPG does not activate mouse CASP11 (or human Casp4) in vitro, suggesting the participation of additional molecules for LPG-mediated CASP11 activation. Our data identify a parasite molecule involved in CASP11 activation, thereby establishing the mechanisms underlying inflammasome activation in response to Leishmania species.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the clinical success of blocking inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) in cancer, the mechanisms controlling the expression of these receptors have not been fully elucidated. Here, we identify a post-transcriptional mechanism regulating PD-1 expression in T cells. Upon activation, the PDCD1 mRNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes coalesce into stress granules that require microtubules and the kinesin 1 molecular motor to proceed to translation. Hence, PD-1 expression is highly sensitive to microtubule or stress granule inhibitors targeting this pathway. Evidence from healthy donors and cancer patients reveals a common regulation for the translation of CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, TIGIT, and BTLA but not of the stimulatory co-receptors OX40, GITR, and 4-1BB mRNAs. In patients, disproportionality analysis of immune-related adverse events for currently used microtubule drugs unveils a significantly higher risk of autoimmunity. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism of immunoregulation with great importance in cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
We systematically investigated the landscape of tumor-suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation events in 33 cancer types by quantitatively measuring their global and local genomic features and their transcriptional and signaling footprints. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas data, we identified with high confidence 337 TSG × cancer events in 30 cancer types, of which 277 were unique events. The majority (91.0%) of these events had a significant downstream impact measured by reduced expression of the TSG itself (cis-effect), disturbance of the transcriptome (trans-effect), or combinatorial effects. Importantly, the transcriptomic changes associated with TSG inactivation events were stronger than the cancer lineage difference, and the same TSGs inactivated in different cancer types tended to cluster together. Several TSGs (e.g., RB1, TP53, and CDKN2A) involved in the regulation of the cell-cycle-formed clusters. Finally, we constructed subnetworks of the TSG × cancer inactivation events, including the local genes frequently disturbed upon the inactivation events.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge from hemogenic endothelium (HE) within the ventral portion of the dorsal aorta during vertebrate development. In zebrafish, Notch signaling induces HE specification from posterior lateral plate mesoderm (PLPM) cells as they migrate over the ventral surface of the somite. During migration, PLPM cells make close contact with Notch-ligand-expressing somitic cells to acquire HE identity. Herein, we show in zebrafish that the small GTPase Rap1b regulates HSC development by potentiating Notch-mediated HE specification. PLPM cells migrate toward the midline along the somite boundary where fibronectin accumulates. Rap1b stimulates integrin β1 to enhance PLPM cell adhesion to fibronectin localized at the somite boundary. Rap1b-induced integrin-β1-mediated adhesion to fibronectin leads to the spreading of PLPM cells to facilitate their physical contact with the Notch-ligand-expressing somitic cells, thereby promoting Notch-mediated HE specification. Thus, we have revealed an unexpected role of Rap1-induced integrin-mediated cell adhesion in HSC development.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells without mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) do not form tumors unless they reconstitute oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by mitochondria acquired from host stroma. To understand why functional respiration is crucial for tumorigenesis, we used time-resolved analysis of tumor formation by mtDNA-depleted cells and genetic manipulations of OXPHOS. We show that pyrimidine biosynthesis dependent on respiration-linked dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is required to overcome cell-cycle arrest, while mitochondrial ATP generation is dispensable for tumorigenesis. Latent DHODH in mtDNA-deficient cells is fully activated with restoration of complex III/IV activity and coenzyme Q redox-cycling after mitochondrial transfer, or by introduction of an alternative oxidase. Further, deletion of DHODH interferes with tumor formation in cells with fully functional OXPHOS, while disruption of mitochondrial ATP synthase has little effect. Our results show that DHODH-driven pyrimidine biosynthesis is an essential pathway linking respiration to tumorigenesis, pointing to inhibitors of DHODH as potential anti-cancer agents.

Abstract: Summary
Severe invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection evades anti-bacterial immunity by attenuating the cellular components of innate immune responses. However, this loss of protection is compensated for by interferon (IFN)-γ-producing immature myeloid cells (γIMCs), which are selectively recruited upon severe invasive GAS infection in mice. Here, we demonstrate that γIMCs provide this IFN-γ-mediated protection by sequentially sensing GAS through two distinct pattern recognition receptors. In a mouse model, GAS is initially recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which promptly induces interleukin (IL)-6 production in γIMCs. γIMC-derived IL-6 promotes the upregulation of a recently identified GAS-sensing receptor, macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle), in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Notably, blockade of γIMC-derived IL-6 abrogates Mincle expression, downstream IFN-γ production, and γIMC-mediated protection against severe invasive GAS infection. Thus, γIMCs regulate host protective immunity against severe invasive GAS infection via a TLR2–IL-6–Mincle axis.

Abstract: Summary
ARID1A encodes an SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling factor and is frequently mutated in various cancers. This study demonstrates that ARID1A-deficient cancer cells are specifically vulnerable to inhibition of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and the glutamate-cysteine ligase synthetase catalytic subunit (GCLC), a rate-limiting enzyme for GSH synthesis. Inhibition of GCLC markedly decreased GSH in ARID1A-deficient cancer cells, leading to apoptotic cell death triggered by excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species. The vulnerability of ARID1A-deficient cancer cells results from low basal levels of GSH due to impaired expression of SLC7A11. The SLC7A11-encoded cystine transporter supplies cells with cysteine, a key source of GSH, and its expression is enhanced by ARID1A-mediated chromatin remodeling. Thus, ARID1A-deficient cancers are susceptible to synthetic lethal targeting of GCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Analysis of cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in biofluids potentially provides a source of disease biomarkers. At present there is no procedure to systematically identify which antigens should be targeted to differentiate cancer-derived from normal host cell-derived EVs. Here, we propose a computational framework that integrates information about membrane proteins in tumors and normal tissues from databases: UniProt, The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project, and the Human Protein Atlas. We developed two methods to assess capture of EVs from specific cell types. (1) We used palmitoylated fluorescent protein (palmtdTomato) to label tumor-derived EVs. Beads displaying antibodies of interest were incubated with conditioned medium from palmtdTomato-expressing cells. Bound EVs were quantified using flow cytometry. (2) We also showed that membrane-bound Gaussia luciferase allows the detection of cancer-derived EVs in blood of tumor-bearing animals. Our analytical and validation platform should be applicable to identify antigens on EVs from any tumor type.

Abstract: Summary
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) controls glucose homeostasis through enzymatic termination of incretin action. We report that plasma DPP-4 activity correlates with body weight and fat mass, but not glucose control, in mice. Genetic disruption of adipocyte Dpp4 expression reduced plasma DPP-4 activity in older mice but did not perturb incretin levels or glucose homeostasis. Knockdown of hepatocyte Dpp4 completely abrogated the obesity-associated increase in plasma DPP-4 activity, reduced liver cytokine expression, and partially attenuated inflammation in adipose tissue without changes in incretin levels or glucose homeostasis. In contrast, circulating levels of soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) were dissociated from inflammation in mice with endothelial-selective or global genetic inactivation of Dpp4. Remarkably, inhibition of DPP-4 enzymatic activity upregulated circulating levels of sDPP4 originating from endothelial or hematopoietic cells without inducing systemic or localized inflammation. Collectively, these findings reveal unexpected complexity in regulation of soluble versus enzymatic DPP-4 and control of inflammation and glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The importance of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein pRB in cell cycle control is well established. However, less is known about its role in differentiation during animal development. Here, we investigated the role of Rbf, the Drosophila pRB homolog, in adult skeletal muscles. We found that the depletion of Rbf severely reduced muscle growth and altered myofibrillogenesis but only minimally affected myoblast proliferation. We identified an Rbf-dependent transcriptional program in late muscle development that is distinct from the canonical role of Rbf in cell cycle control. Unexpectedly, Rbf acts as a transcriptional activator of the myogenic and metabolic genes in the growing muscles. The genomic regions bound by Rbf contained the binding sites of several factors that genetically interacted with Rbf by modulating Rbf-dependent phenotype. Thus, our results reveal a distinctive role for Rbf as a direct activator of the myogenic transcriptional program that drives late muscle differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Trophoblast stem (TS) cells are increasingly used as a model system for studying placentation and placental disorders. However, practical limitations of genetic manipulation have posed challenges for genetic analysis using TS cells. Here, we report the generation of mouse parthenogenetic haploid TS cells (haTSCs) and show that supplementation with FGF4 and inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) enable the maintenance of their haploidy and developmental potential. The resulting haTSCs have 20 chromosomes, exhibit typical expression features of TS cells, possess the multipotency to differentiate into specialized trophoblast cell types, and can chimerize E13.5 and term placentas. We also demonstrate the capability of the haTSCs to undergo genetic manipulation and facilitate genome-wide screening in the trophoblast lineage. We expect that haTSCs will offer a powerful tool for studying functional genomics and placental biology.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular recordings in vivo remains the best technique to link single-neuron electrical properties to network function. Yet existing methods are limited in accuracy, throughput, and duration, primarily via washout, membrane damage, and movement-induced failure. Here, we introduce flexible quartz nanopipettes (inner diameters of 10–25 nm and spring constant of ∼0.08 N/m) as nanoscale analogs of traditional glass microelectrodes. Nanopipettes enable stable intracellular recordings (seal resistances of 500 to ∼800 MΩ, 5 to ∼10 cells/nanopipette, and duration of ∼1 hr) in anaesthetized and awake head-restrained mice, exhibit minimal diffusional flux, and facilitate precise recording and stimulation. When combined with quantum-dot labels and microprisms, nanopipettes enable two-photon targeted electrophysiology from both somata and dendrites, and even paired recordings from neighboring neurons, while permitting simultaneous population imaging across cortical layers. We demonstrate the versatility of this method by recording from parvalbumin-positive (Pv) interneurons while imaging seizure propagation, and we find that Pv depolarization block coincides with epileptic spread. Flexible nanopipettes present a simple method to procure stable intracellular recordings in vivo.

Abstract: Grina/TMBIM3 is a poorly characterized transmembrane protein with a broad expression pattern in mammals and with a very ancient origin within eukaryotes. Although initially characterized as an NMDA-receptor associated subunit, there is increasing evidence that Grina/TMBIM3 is involved in the unfolded protein response and controls apoptosis via regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. Here, we investigate a putative direct interaction of Grina/TMBIM3 with voltage gated Ca2+ channels, in particular with the CaV2.2 α1-subunit and describe its modulatory effects on the current through CaV2.2 N-type channels. Direct interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies and membrane localization was proven. Co-expression of Grina/TMBIM3 with CaV2.2 channels resulted in a significant decrease of the current amplitude and in a slowing of the kinetics of current activation. This effect was accompanied by a significant shift of the voltage dependencies of activation time constants towards more depolarized voltages. Application of a stimulus protocol including a strong depolarizing pulse relieved inhibition of current amplitude by Grina/TMBIM3. When Grina/TMBIM3 was present, inactivation by an action potential-like train of pulses was diminished. Both observations resemble mechanisms that are well-studied modulatory effects of G-protein βγ subunits on CaV2 channels. The impact of Grina/TMBIM3 and G-protein βγ subunits are rather comparable with respect to suppression of current amplitude and slowing of activation kinetics. Furthermore, both modulators had the same effect on current inactivation when evoked by an action potential-like train of pulses.

Abstract: Summary
Successful metastasis requires the co-evolution of stromal and cancer cells. We used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture coupled with quantitative, label-free phosphoproteomics to study the bidirectional signaling in ovarian cancer cells and human-derived, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) after co-culture. In cancer cells, the interaction with CAFs supported glycogenolysis under normoxic conditions and induced phosphorylation and activation of phosphoglucomutase 1, an enzyme involved in glycogen metabolism. Glycogen was funneled into glycolysis, leading to increased proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells co-cultured with human CAFs. Glycogen mobilization in cancer cells was dependent on p38α MAPK activation in CAFs. In vivo, deletion of p38α in CAFs and glycogen phosphorylase inhibition in cancer cells reduced metastasis, suggesting that glycogen is an energy source used by cancer cells to facilitate metastatic tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
Correct localization of Rab GTPases in cells is critical for proper function in membrane trafficking, yet the mechanisms that target Rabs to specific subcellular compartments remain controversial. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate and consequently stabilize Rab substrates on membranes, thus implicating GEFs as the primary determinants of Rab localization. A competing hypothesis is that the Rab C-terminal hypervariable domain (HVD) serves as a subcellular targeting signal. In this study, we present a unifying mechanism in which the HVD controls targeting of certain Rabs by mediating interaction with their GEFs. We demonstrate that the TRAPP complexes, two related GEFs that use the same catalytic site to activate distinct Rabs, distinguish between Ypt1 (Rab1) and Ypt31/32 (Rab11) via their divergent HVDs. Remarkably, we find that HVD length gates Rab access to the TRAPPII complex by constraining the distance between the nucleotide-binding domain and the membrane surface.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic adaptations accompanying the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria remain poorly understood. To study this relationship, we profiled the growth of lab-evolved antibiotic-resistant lineages of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa across 190 unique carbon sources. Our data revealed that the evolution of antibiotic resistance resulted in systems-level changes to growth dynamics and metabolic phenotype. A genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of P. aeruginosa was paired with whole-genome sequencing data to predict genes contributing to observed changes in metabolism. We experimentally validated computational predictions to identify mutations in resistant P. aeruginosa affecting loss of catabolic function. Finally, we found a shared metabolic phenotype between lab-evolved P. aeruginosa and clinical isolates with similar mutational landscapes. Our results build upon previous knowledge of antibiotic-induced metabolic adaptation and provide a framework for the identification of metabolic limitations in antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota can modulate human metabolism through interactions with macronutrients. However, microbiota-diet-host interactions are difficult to study because bacteria interact in complex food webs in concert with the host, and many of the bacteria are not yet characterized. To reduce the complexity, we colonize mice with a simplified intestinal microbiota (SIM) composed of ten sequenced strains isolated from the human gut with complementing pathways to metabolize dietary fibers. We feed the SIM mice one of three diets (chow [fiber rich], high-fat/high-sucrose, or zero-fat/high-sucrose diets [both low in fiber]) and investigate (1) how dietary fiber, saturated fat, and sucrose affect the abundance and transcriptome of the SIM community, (2) the effect of microbe-diet interactions on circulating metabolites, and (3) how microbiota-diet interactions affect host metabolism. Our SIM model can be used in future studies to help clarify how microbiota-diet interactions contribute to metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
In plants, the position of lateral roots (LRs) depends on initiation sites induced by auxin. The domain of high auxin response responsible for LR initiation stretches over several cells, but only a pair of pericycle cells (LR founder cells) will develop into LRs. In this work, we identified a signaling cascade controlling LR formation through lateral inhibition. It comprises a peptide hormone TARGET OF LBD SIXTEEN 2 (TOLS2), its receptor RLK7, and a downstream transcription factor PUCHI. TOLS2 is expressed at the LR founder cells and inhibits LR initiation. Time-lapse imaging of auxin-responsive DR5:LUCIFERASE reporter expression revealed that occasionally two pairs of LR founder cells are specified in close proximity even in wild-type and that one of them exists only transiently and disappears in an RLK7-dependent manner. We propose that the selection of LR founder cells by the peptide hormone-receptor cascade ensures proper LR spacing.

Abstract: Summary
A truncating mutation in the mouse Srrm4 gene, which encodes a neuronal splicing factor, causes alternative splicing defects selectively in the ear. The mechanism by which splicing is preserved in the brain of these mice is not known. Here, we show that SRRM3 limits the Srrm4 mutation-associated defects to the ear and that, in cortical neurons, overlapping SRRM3-SRRM4 activity regulates the development of interneuronal inhibition. In vitro, SRRM3 and SRRM4 regulate the same splicing events, but a mutation in mouse Srrm3 causes tremors and mild defects in neuronal alternative splicing, demonstrating unique SRRM3 roles in vivo. Mice harboring mutations in both Srrm3 and Srrm4 die neonatally and exhibit severe splicing defects. In these mice, splicing alterations prevent inactivation of the gene repressor REST, which maintains immature excitatory GABAergic neurotransmission by repressing K-Cl cotransporter 2. Thus, our data reveal that SRRM3 and SRRM4 act redundantly to regulate GABAergic neurotransmission by inactivating REST.

Abstract: Summary
The hepatic TCA cycle supports oxidative and biosynthetic metabolism. This dual responsibility requires anaplerotic pathways, such as pyruvate carboxylase (PC), to generate TCA cycle intermediates necessary for biosynthesis without disrupting oxidative metabolism. Liver-specific PC knockout (LPCKO) mice were created to test the role of anaplerotic flux in liver metabolism. LPCKO mice have impaired hepatic anaplerosis, diminution of TCA cycle intermediates, suppressed gluconeogenesis, reduced TCA cycle flux, and a compensatory increase in ketogenesis and renal gluconeogenesis. Loss of PC depleted aspartate and compromised urea cycle function, causing elevated urea cycle intermediates and hyperammonemia. Loss of PC prevented diet-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance but depleted NADPH and glutathione, which exacerbated oxidative stress and correlated with elevated liver inflammation. Thus, despite catalyzing the synthesis of intermediates also produced by other anaplerotic pathways, PC is specifically necessary for maintaining oxidation, biosynthesis, and pathways distal to the TCA cycle, such as antioxidant defenses.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic beta cells have been shown to be heterogeneous at multiple levels. However, spatially interrogating transcriptional heterogeneity in the intact tissue has been challenging. Here, we developed an optimized protocol for single-molecule transcript imaging in the intact pancreas and used it to identify a sub-population of “extreme” beta cells with elevated mRNA levels of insulin and other secretory genes. Extreme beta cells contain higher ribosomal and proinsulin content but lower levels of insulin protein in fasted states, suggesting they may be tuned for basal insulin secretion. They exhibit a distinctive intra-cellular polarization pattern, with elevated mRNA concentrations in an apical ER-enriched compartment, distinct from the localization of nascent and mature proteins. The proportion of extreme cells increases in db/db diabetic mice, potentially facilitating the required increase in basal insulin. Our results thus highlight a sub-population of beta cells that may carry distinct functional roles along physiological and pathological timescales.

Abstract: Summary
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are associated with decreased patient prognosis but have failed as anti-invasive drug targets despite promoting cancer cell invasion. Through time-lapse imaging, optical highlighting, and combined genetic removal of the five MMPs expressed during anchor cell (AC) invasion in C. elegans, we find that MMPs hasten invasion by degrading basement membrane (BM). Though irregular and delayed, AC invasion persists in MMP− animals via adaptive enrichment of the Arp2/3 complex at the invasive cell membrane, which drives formation of an F-actin-rich protrusion that physically breaches and displaces BM. Using a large-scale RNAi synergistic screen and a genetically encoded ATP FRET sensor, we discover that mitochondria enrich within the protrusion and provide localized ATP that fuels F-actin network growth. Thus, without MMPs, an invasive cell can alter its BM-breaching tactics, suggesting that targeting adaptive mechanisms will be necessary to mitigate BM invasion in human pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common indication for liver transplantation. How fat-rich diets promote progression from fatty liver to more damaging inflammatory and fibrotic stages is poorly understood. Here, we show that disrupting phosphorylation at Ser196 (S196A) in the liver X receptor alpha (LXRα, NR1H3) retards NAFLD progression in mice on a high-fat-high-cholesterol diet. Mechanistically, this is explained by key histone acetylation (H3K27) and transcriptional changes in pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, S196A-LXRα expression reveals the regulation of novel diet-specific LXRα-responsive genes, including the induction of Ces1f, implicated in the breakdown of hepatic lipids. This involves induced H3K27 acetylation and altered LXR and TBLR1 cofactor occupancy at the Ces1f gene in S196A fatty livers.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing has transformed biotechnology and therapeutics. However, in vivo applications of some Cas9s are hindered by large size (limiting delivery by adeno-associated virus [AAV] vectors), off-target editing, or complex protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) that restrict the density of recognition sequences in target DNA. Here, we exploited natural variation in the PAM-interacting domains (PIDs) of closely related Cas9s to identify a compact ortholog from Neisseria meningitidis—Nme2Cas9—that recognizes a simple dinucleotide PAM (N4CC) that provides for high target site density. All-in-one AAV delivery of Nme2Cas9 with a guide RNA targeting Pcsk9 in adult mouse liver produces efficient genome editing and reduced serum cholesterol with exceptionally high specificity. We further expand our single-AAV platform to pre-implanted zygotes for streamlined generation of genome-edited mice. Nme2Cas9 combines all-in-one AAV compatibility, exceptional editing accuracy within cells, and high target site density for in vivo genome editing applications.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional regulation occurs via changes to rates of different biochemical steps of transcription, but it remains unclear which rates are subject to change upon biological perturbation. Biochemical studies have suggested that stimuli predominantly affect the rates of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment and polymerase release from promoter-proximal pausing. Single-cell studies revealed that transcription occurs in discontinuous bursts, suggesting that features of such bursts like frequency and intensity could also be regulated. We combined Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and single-cell transcriptional measurements to show that an independently regulated burst initiation step is required before polymerase recruitment can occur. Using a number of global and targeted transcriptional regulatory perturbations, we showed that biological perturbations regulated both burst initiation and polymerase pause release rates but seemed not to regulate polymerase recruitment rate. Our results suggest that transcriptional regulation primarily acts by changing the rates of burst initiation and polymerase pause release.

Abstract: Summary
Iron metabolism is an essential process that when dysregulated causes disease. Mammalian serum transferrin (TF) plays a primary role in delivering iron to cells. To improve our understanding of the conservation of iron metabolism between species, we investigate here the function of the TF homolog in Drosophila melanogaster, transferrin 1 (Tsf1). Tsf1 knockdown results in iron accumulation in the gut and iron deficiency in the fat body (which is analogous to the mammalian liver). Fat body-derived Tsf1 localizes to the gut surface, suggesting that Tsf1 functions in trafficking iron between the gut and the fat body, similar to TF in mammals. Moreover, Tsf1 knockdown strongly suppresses the phenotypic effects of ferritin (Fer1HCH) RNAi, an established iron trafficker in Drosophila. We propose that Tsf1 and ferritin compete for iron in the Drosophila intestine and demonstrate the value of using Drosophila for investigating iron trafficking and the evolution of systemic iron regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Metazoan chromosomes are sequentially partitioned into topologically associating domains (TADs) and then into smaller sub-domains. One class of sub-domains, insulated neighborhoods, are proposed to spatially sequester and insulate the enclosed genes through self-association and chromatin looping. However, it has not been determined functionally whether promoter-enhancer interactions and gene regulation are broadly restricted to within these loops. Here, we employed published datasets from murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to identify insulated neighborhoods that confine promoter-enhancer interactions and demarcate gene regulatory regions. To directly address the functionality of these regions, we depleted estrogen-related receptor β (Esrrb), which binds the Mediator co-activator complex, to impair enhancers of genes within 222 insulated neighborhoods without causing mESC differentiation. Esrrb depletion reduces Mediator binding, promoter-enhancer looping, and expression of both nascent RNA and mRNA within the insulated neighborhoods without significantly affecting the flanking genes. Our data indicate that insulated neighborhoods represent functional regulons in mammalian genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors display profound changes in cellular metabolism, yet how these changes aid the development and growth of tumors is not fully understood. Here we use a multi-omic approach to examine liver carcinogenesis and regeneration, and find that progressive loss of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism promotes tumor development and growth. In human hepatocellular carcinomas and animal models of liver cancer, suppression of BCAA catabolic enzyme expression led to BCAA accumulation in tumors, though this was not observed in regenerating liver tissues. The degree of enzyme suppression strongly correlated with tumor aggressiveness, and was an independent predictor of clinical outcome. Moreover, modulating BCAA accumulation regulated cancer cell proliferation in vitro, and tumor burden and overall survival in vivo. Dietary BCAA intake in humans also correlated with cancer mortality risk. In summary, loss of BCAA catabolism in tumors confers functional advantages, which could be exploited by therapeutic interventions in certain cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular transport and homeostasis of the endomembrane system in eukaryotic cells depend on the formation and fusion of vesicular carriers. Coat protein complex (COP) II vesicles export newly synthesized secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas COPI vesicles facilitate traffic from the Golgi to the ER and intra-Golgi transport. Mammalian cells express various isoforms of COPII and COPI coat proteins. To investigate the roles of coat protein paralogs, we have combined in vitro vesicle reconstitution from semi-intact cells with SILAC-based mass spectrometric analysis. Here, we describe the core proteomes of mammalian COPII and COPI vesicles. Whereas the compositions of COPII vesicles reconstituted with various isoforms of the cargo-binding subunit Sec24 differ depending on the paralog used, all of the isoforms of the COPI coat produce COPI-coated vesicles with strikingly similar protein compositions.

Abstract: Summary
Optimal cell performance depends on cell size and the appropriate relative size, i.e., scaling, of the nucleus. How nuclear scaling is regulated and contributes to cell function is poorly understood, especially in skeletal muscle fibers, which are among the largest cells, containing hundreds of nuclei. Here, we present a Drosophila in vivo system to analyze nuclear scaling in whole multinucleated muscle fibers, genetically manipulate individual components, and assess muscle function. Despite precise global coordination, we find that individual nuclei within a myofiber establish different local scaling relationships by adjusting their size and synthetic activity in correlation with positional or spatial cues. While myonuclei exhibit compensatory potential, even minor changes in global nuclear size scaling correlate with reduced muscle function. Our study provides the first comprehensive approach to unraveling the intrinsic regulation of size in multinucleated muscle fibers. These insights to muscle cell biology will accelerate the development of interventions for muscle diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Levels of the ribosome, the conserved molecular machine that mediates translation, are tightly linked to cellular growth rate. In humans, ribosomopathies are diseases associated with cell-type-specific pathologies and reduced ribosomal protein (RP) levels. Because gene expression defects resulting from ribosome deficiency have not yet been experimentally defined, we systematically probed mRNA, translation, and protein signatures that were either unlinked from or linked to cellular growth rate in RP-deficient yeast cells. Ribosome deficiency was associated with altered translation of gene subclasses, and profound general secondary effects of RP loss on the spectrum of cellular mRNAs were seen. Among these effects, growth-defective 60S mutants increased synthesis of proteins involved in proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas 40S mutants accumulated mature 60S subunits and increased translation of ribosome biogenesis genes. These distinct signatures of protein synthesis suggest intriguing and currently mysterious differences in the cellular consequences of deficiency for small and large ribosomal subunits.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal epithelial cells have a defined hierarchy with stem cells located at the bottom of the crypt and differentiated cells more at the top. Epithelial cell renewal and differentiation are strictly controlled by various regulatory signals provided by epithelial as well as surrounding cells. Although there is evidence that stromal cells contribute to the intestinal stem cell niche, their markers and the soluble signals they produce have been incompletely defined. Using a number of established stromal cell markers, we phenotypically and functionally examined fibroblast populations in the colon. CD90+ fibroblasts located in close proximity to stem cells in vivo support organoid growth in vitro and express crucial stem cell growth factors, such as Grem1, Wnt2b, and R-spondin3. Moreover, we found that CD90+ fibroblasts express a family of proteins—class 3 semaphorins (Sema3)—that are required for the supportive effect of CD90+ fibroblasts on organoid growth.

Abstract: Summary
Quiescence is a stress-resistant state in which cells reversibly exit the cell cycle and suspend most processes. Quiescence is essential for stem cell maintenance, and its misregulation is implicated in tumor formation. One of the hallmarks of quiescent cells is highly condensed chromatin. Because condensed chromatin often correlates with transcriptional silencing, it has been hypothesized that chromatin compaction represses transcription during quiescence. However, the technology to test this model by determining chromatin structure within cells at gene resolution has not previously been available. Here, we use Micro-C XL to map chromatin contacts at single-nucleosome resolution genome-wide in quiescent Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We describe chromatin domains on the order of 10–60 kilobases that, only in quiescent cells, are formed by condensin-mediated loops. Condensin depletion prevents the compaction of chromatin within domains and leads to widespread transcriptional de-repression. Finally, we demonstrate that condensin-dependent chromatin compaction is conserved in quiescent human fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas immune systems utilize RNA-guided nucleases to protect bacteria from bacteriophage infection. Bacteriophages have in turn evolved inhibitory “anti-CRISPR” (Acr) proteins, including six inhibitors (AcrIIA1–AcrIIA6) that can block DNA cutting and genome editing by type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes. We show here that AcrIIA2 and its more potent homolog, AcrIIA2b, prevent Cas9 binding to DNA by occluding protein residues required for DNA binding. Cryo-EM-determined structures of AcrIIA2 or AcrIIA2b bound to S. pyogenes Cas9 reveal a mode of competitive inhibition of DNA binding that is distinct from other known Acrs. Differences in the temperature dependence of Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA2b arise from differences in both inhibitor structure and the local inhibitor-binding environment on Cas9. These findings expand the natural toolbox for regulating CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing temporally, spatially, and conditionally.

Abstract: The 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a nutrient-sensitive kinase that plays a key role in the control of cellular energy metabolism. We have explored here the relationship between AMPK and Ca2+ signaling by looking at the effect of an AMPK activator (A769662) and an AMPK inhibitor (dorsomorphin) on histamine-induced Ca2+-release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in HeLa cells. Our data show that incubation with A769662 (EC50 = 29 μM) inhibited histamine-induced Ca2+-release from the ER in intact cells, as well as inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells. On the contrary, dorsomorphin (EC50 = 0.4 μM) activated both histamine and IP3-induced Ca2+-release and reversed the effect of A769662. These results suggest a direct effect of AMPK regulation on IP3 receptor (IP3R) function. A phosphoproteomic study did not reveal changes in IP3R phosphorylation, but showed significant changes in phosphorylation of proteins placed upstream in the IP3R interactome and in several proteins related with Ca2+ metabolism, which could be candidates to mediate the effects observed. In conclusion, our data suggest that AMPK negatively regulates IP3R. This effect constitutes a novel and very important link between Ca2+ signaling and the AMPK pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Cytoskeletal actin dynamics is essential for T cell activation. Here, we show evidence that the binding kinetics of the antigen engaging the T cell receptor influences the nanoscale actin organization and mechanics of the immune synapse. Using an engineered T cell system expressing a specific T cell receptor and stimulated by a range of antigens, we found that the peak force experienced by the T cell receptor during activation was independent of the unbinding kinetics of the stimulating antigen. Conversely, quantification of the actin retrograde flow velocity at the synapse revealed a striking dependence on the antigen unbinding kinetics. These findings suggest that the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton actively adjusted to normalize the force experienced by the T cell receptor in an antigen-specific manner. Consequently, tuning actin dynamics in response to antigen kinetics may thus be a mechanism that allows T cells to adjust the lengthscale and timescale of T cell receptor signaling.

Abstract: Summary
TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine that has the potential to induce apoptosis under inflammation. How endothelial cells (ECs) are spared from this fate in inflammatory environments where TNF-α is present is not known. Here, we show that TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) ensures EC survival and maintains vascular integrity upon TNF-α stimulation. Endothelial-specific TAK1 knockout mice exhibit intestinal and liver hemorrhage due to EC apoptosis, leading to vascular destruction and rapid death. This EC apoptosis was induced by TNF-α from myeloid cells responding to intestinal microbiota. TNF-α secretion associated with inflammation also induced vascular defects in inflamed organs. Additionally, we determined that TAK1 deletion in tumor ECs resulted in blood vessel and hence tumor regression. Our results illuminate mechanisms ensuring survival of intestinal and liver ECs under physiological conditions and ECs of other organs under inflammatory conditions that could be exploited for anti-angiogenic therapy to treat cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC1) is a signaling hub on the lysosome surface, responding to lysosomal amino acids. Although arginine is metabolically important, the physiological arginine sensor that activates mTOR remains unclear. Here, we show that transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5) translocates from plasma membrane to lysosome upon arginine sufficiency and senses arginine, culminating in mTORC1/S6K1 activation. TM4SF5 bound active mTOR upon arginine sufficiency and constitutively bound amino acid transporter SLC38A9. TM4SF5 binding to the cytosolic arginine sensor Castor1 decreased upon arginine sufficiency, thus allowing TM4SF5-mediated sensing of metabolic amino acids. TM4SF5 directly bound free L-arginine via its extracellular loop possibly for the efflux, being supported by mutant study and homology and molecular docking modeling. Therefore, we propose that lysosomal TM4SF5 senses and enables arginine efflux for mTORC1/S6K1 activation, and arginine-auxotroph in hepatocellular carcinoma may be targeted by blocking the arginine sensing using anti-TM4SF5 reagents.

Abstract: Summary
B cell development is a highly regulated process that requires stepwise rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes to generate a functional B cell receptor (BCR). The polycomb group protein BMI1 is required for B cell development, but its function in developing B cells remains poorly defined. We demonstrate that BMI1 functions in a cell-autonomous manner at two stages during early B cell development. First, loss of BMI1 results in a differentiation block at the pro-B cell to pre-B cell transition due to the inability of BMI1-deficient cells to transcribe newly rearranged Igh genes. Accordingly, introduction of a pre-rearranged Igh allele partially restored B cell development in Bmi1−/− mice. In addition, BMI1 is required to prevent premature p53 signaling, and as a consequence, Bmi1−/− large pre-B cells fail to properly proliferate. Altogether, our results clarify the role of BMI1 in early B cell development and uncover an unexpected function of BMI1 during VDJ recombination.

Abstract: Summary
In mitosis, cells inactivate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways to preserve genome stability. However, some early signaling events still occur, such as recruitment of the scaffold protein MDC1 to phosphorylated histone H2AX at DSBs. Yet, it remains unclear whether these events are important for maintaining genome stability during mitosis. Here, we identify a highly conserved protein-interaction surface in MDC1 that is phosphorylated by CK2 and recognized by the DNA-damage response mediator protein TOPBP1. Disruption of MDC1-TOPBP1 binding causes a specific loss of TOPBP1 recruitment to DSBs in mitotic but not interphase cells, accompanied by mitotic radiosensitivity, increased micronuclei, and chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, we find that TOPBP1 forms filamentous structures capable of bridging MDC1 foci in mitosis, indicating that MDC1-TOPBP1 complexes tether DSBs until repair is reactivated in the following G1 phase. Thus, we reveal an important, hitherto-unnoticed cooperation between MDC1 and TOPBP1 in maintaining genome stability during cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular prion protein (PrPC) binds the scrapie conformation of PrP (PrPSc) and oligomeric β-amyloid peptide (Aβo) to mediate transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), respectively. We conducted cellular and biochemical screens for compounds blocking PrPC interaction with Aβo. A polymeric degradant of an antibiotic targets Aβo binding sites on PrPC with low nanomolar affinity and prevents Aβo-induced pathophysiology. We then identified a range of negatively charged polymers with specific PrPC affinity in the low to sub-nanomolar range, from both biological (melanin) and synthetic (poly [4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid], PSCMA) origin. Association of PSCMA with PrPC prevents Aβo/PrPC-hydrogel formation, blocks Aβo binding to neurons, and abrogates PrPSc production by ScN2a cells. We show that oral PSCMA yields effective brain concentrations and rescues APPswe/PS1ΔE9 transgenic mice from AD-related synapse loss and memory deficits. Thus, an orally active PrPC-directed polymeric agent provides a potential therapeutic approach to address neurodegeneration in AD and TSE.

Abstract: Summary
UHRF1 facilitates the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns in mammalian cells. The establishment domains are defined, including E3 ligase function, but the maintenance domains are poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that UHRF1 histone- and hemimethylated DNA binding functions, but not E3 ligase activity, maintain cancer-specific DNA methylation in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Disrupting either chromatin reader activity reverses DNA hypermethylation, reactivates epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), and reduces CRC oncogenic properties. Moreover, an inverse correlation between high UHRF1 and low TSG expression tracks with CRC progression and reduced patient survival. Defining critical UHRF1 domain functions and its relationship with CRC prognosis suggests directions for, and value of, targeting this protein to develop therapeutic DNA demethylating agents.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetes is a bihormonal disorder resulting from combined insulin and glucagon secretion defects. Mice lacking fumarase (Fh1) in their β cells (Fh1βKO mice) develop progressive hyperglycemia and dysregulated glucagon secretion similar to that seen in diabetic patients (too much at high glucose and too little at low glucose). The glucagon secretion defects are corrected by low concentrations of tolbutamide and prevented by the sodium-glucose transport (SGLT) inhibitor phlorizin. These data link hyperglycemia, intracellular Na+ accumulation, and acidification to impaired mitochondrial metabolism, reduced ATP production, and dysregulated glucagon secretion. Protein succination, reflecting reduced activity of fumarase, is observed in α cells from hyperglycemic Fh1βKO and β-V59M gain-of-function KATP channel mice, diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats, and patients with type 2 diabetes. Succination is also observed in renal tubular cells and cardiomyocytes from hyperglycemic Fh1βKO mice, suggesting that the model can be extended to other SGLT-expressing cells and may explain part of the spectrum of diabetic complications.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance to asparaginase, an antileukemic enzyme that depletes asparagine, is a common clinical problem. Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we found a synthetic lethal interaction between Wnt pathway activation and asparaginase in acute leukemias resistant to this enzyme. Wnt pathway activation induced asparaginase sensitivity in distinct treatment-resistant subtypes of acute leukemia, but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors. Sensitization to asparaginase was mediated by Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-dependent protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, a catabolic source of asparagine. Inhibiting the alpha isoform of GSK3 phenocopied this effect, and pharmacologic GSK3α inhibition profoundly sensitized drug-resistant leukemias to asparaginase. Our findings provide a molecular rationale for activation of Wnt/STOP signaling to improve the therapeutic index of asparaginase.

Abstract: Summary
The 26S proteasome is the central ATP-dependent protease in eukaryotes and is essential for organismal health. Proteasome assembly is mediated by several dedicated, evolutionarily conserved chaperone proteins. These chaperones associate transiently with assembly intermediates but are absent from mature proteasomes. Chaperone eviction upon completion of proteasome assembly is necessary for normal proteasome function, but how they are released remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that the Nas6 assembly chaperone, homolog of the human oncogene gankyrin, is evicted from nascent proteasomes during completion of assembly via a conformation-specific allosteric interaction of the Rpn5 subunit with the proteasomal ATPase ring. Subsequent ATP binding by the ATPase subunit Rpt3 promotes conformational remodeling of the ATPase ring that evicts Nas6 from the nascent proteasome. Our study demonstrates how assembly-coupled allosteric signals promote chaperone eviction and provides a framework for understanding the eviction of other chaperones from this biomedically important molecular machine.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome turnover is rapid, occurring several times per cell cycle. To access the effect of nucleosome turnover on the epigenetic landscape, we investigated H3K79 methylation, which is produced by a single methyltransferase (Dot1l) with no known demethylase. Using chemical-induced proximity (CIP), we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is determined by nucleosome turnover rates. Furthermore, propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit. More broadly, a meta-analysis of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks. Based on data from worms, flies, and mice, we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an invaluable tool for modeling diseases and hold promise for regenerative medicine. For understanding pluripotency and lineage differentiation mechanisms, a critical first step involves systematically cataloging essential genes (EGs) that are indispensable for hPSC fitness, defined as cell reproduction in this study. To map essential genetic determinants of hPSC fitness, we performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens in an inducible Cas9 H1 hPSC line cultured on feeder cells and laminin to identify EGs. Among these, we found FOXH1 and VENTX, genes that encode transcription factors previously implicated in stem cell biology, as well as an uncharacterized gene, C22orf43/DRICH1. hPSC EGs are substantially different from other human model cell lines, and EGs in hPSCs are highly context dependent with respect to different growth substrates. Our CRISPR screens establish parameters for genome-wide screens in hPSCs, which will facilitate the characterization of unappreciated genetic regulators of hPSC biology.

Abstract: Summary
Leukocyte adhesion requires β2-integrin activation. Resting integrins exist in a bent-closed conformation—i.e., not extended (E−) and not high affinity (H−)—unable to bind ligand. Fully activated E+H+ integrin binds intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) expressed on the opposing cell in trans. E−H− transitions to E+H+ through E+H− or through E−H+, which binds to ICAMs on the same cell in cis. Spatial patterning of activated integrins is thought to be required for effective arrest, but no high-resolution cell surface localization maps of activated integrins exist. Here, we developed Super-STORM by combining super-resolution microscopy with molecular modeling to precisely localize activated integrin molecules and identify the molecular patterns of activated integrins on primary human neutrophils. At the time of neutrophil arrest, E−H+ integrins face each other to form oriented (non-random) nanoclusters. To address the mechanism causing this pattern, we blocked integrin binding to ICAMs in cis, which significantly relieved the face-to-face orientation.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are found in most cancer malignancies and support tumorigenesis by suppressing immunity and promoting tumor growth. Here we identify the bromodomain (BRD) of CBP/EP300 as a critical regulator of H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in MDSCs across promoters and enhancers of pro-tumorigenic target genes. In preclinical tumor models, in vivo administration of a CBP/EP300-BRD inhibitor (CBP/EP300-BRDi) alters intratumoral MDSCs and attenuates established tumor growth in immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice, as well as in MDSC-dependent xenograft models. Inhibition of CBP/EP300-BRD redirects tumor-associated MDSCs from a suppressive to an inflammatory phenotype through downregulation of STAT pathway-related genes and inhibition of Arg1 and iNOS. Similarly, CBP/EP300-BRDi decreases differentiation and suppressive function of human MDSCs in vitro. Our findings uncover a role of CBP/EP300-BRD in intratumoral MDSCs that may be targeted therapeutically to boost anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
NANOG is an essential transcriptional factor for the maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) in prostate cancer (PCa). However, the regulation mechanism of NANOG protein stability in cancer progression is still elusive. Here, we report that NANOG is degraded by SPOP, a frequently mutated tumor suppressor of PCa. Cancer-associated mutations of SPOP or the mutation of NANOG at S68Y abrogates the SPOP-mediated NANOG degradation, leading to elevated PCa cancer stemness and poor prognosis. In addition, SPOP-mediated NANOG degradation is controlled by the AMPK-BRAF signal axis through the phosphorylation of NANOG at Ser68, which blocked the interaction between SPOP and NANOG. Thus, our study provides a regulation mechanism of PCa stemness controlled by phosphorylation-mediated NANOG stability, which helps to identify novel drug targets and improve therapeutic strategy for PCa.

Sequential Ubiquitination of Ribosomal Protein uS3 Triggers the Degradation of Non-functional 18S rRNA,

Abstract: Summary
18S non-functional rRNA decay (NRD) eliminates non-functional 18S rRNA with deleterious mutations in the decoding center. Dissociation of the non-functional 80S ribosome into 40S and 60S subunits is a prerequisite step for degradation of the non-functional 18S rRNA. However, the mechanisms by which the non-functional ribosome is recognized and dissociated into subunits remain elusive. Here, we report that the sequential ubiquitination of non-functional ribosomes is crucial for subunit dissociation. 18S NRD requires Mag2-mediated monoubiquitination followed by Hel2- and Rsp5-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of uS3 at the 212th lysine residue. Determination of the aberrant 18S rRNA levels in sucrose gradient fractions revealed that the subunit dissociation of stalled ribosomes requires sequential ubiquitination of uS3 by E3 ligases and ATPase activity of Slh1 (Rqt2), as well as Asc1 and Dom34. We propose that sequential uS3 ubiquitination of the non-functional 80S ribosome induces subunit dissociation by Slh1, leading to degradation of the non-functional 18S rRNA.

Abstract: Summary
In the developing pancreas, transient Neurog3-expressing progenitors give rise to four major islet cell types: α, β, δ, and γ; when and how the Neurog3+ cells choose cell fate is unknown. Using single-cell RNA-seq, trajectory analysis, and combinatorial lineage tracing, we showed here that the Neurog3+ cells co-expressing Myt1 (i.e., Myt1+Neurog3+) were biased toward β cell fate, while those not simultaneously expressing Myt1 (Myt1-Neurog3+) favored α fate. Myt1 manipulation only marginally affected α versus β cell specification, suggesting Myt1 as a marker but not determinant for islet-cell-type specification. The Myt1+Neurog3+ cells displayed higher Dnmt1 expression and enhancer methylation at Arx, an α-fate-promoting gene. Inhibiting Dnmts in pancreatic progenitors promoted α cell specification, while Dnmt1 overexpression or Arx enhancer hypermethylation favored β cell production. Moreover, the pancreatic progenitors contained distinct Arx enhancer methylation states without transcriptionally definable sub-populations, a phenotype independent of Neurog3 activity. These data suggest that Neurog3-independent methylation on fate-determining gene enhancers specifies distinct endocrine-cell programs.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical plasticity peaks early in life and tapers in adulthood, as exemplified in the primary visual cortex (V1), wherein brief loss of vision in one eye reduces cortical responses to inputs from that eye during the critical period but not in adulthood. The synaptic locus of cortical plasticity and the cell-autonomous synaptic factors determining critical periods remain unclear. We here demonstrate that the immunoglobulin protein Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (SynCAM 1/Cadm1) is regulated by visual experience and limits V1 plasticity. Loss of SynCAM 1 selectively reduces the number of thalamocortical inputs onto parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons, impairing the maturation of feedforward inhibition in V1. SynCAM 1 acts in PV+ interneurons to actively restrict cortical plasticity, and brief PV+-specific knockdown of SynCAM 1 in adult visual cortex restores juvenile-like plasticity. These results identify a synapse-specific, cell-autonomous mechanism for thalamocortical visual circuit maturation and closure of the visual critical period.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive and unresolved neuroinflammation is a key component of the pathological cascade in brain injuries such as ischemic stroke. Here, we report that TRIM9, a brain-specific tripartite motif (TRIM) protein, was highly expressed in the peri-infarct areas shortly after ischemic insults in mice, but expression was decreased in aged mice, which are known to have increased neuroinflammation after stroke. Mechanistically, TRIM9 sequestered β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) from the Skp-Cullin-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex, blocking IκBα degradation and thereby dampening nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent proinflammatory mediator production and immune cell infiltration to limit neuroinflammation. Consequently, Trim9-deficient mice were highly vulnerable to ischemia, manifesting uncontrolled neuroinflammation and exacerbated neuropathological outcomes. Systemic administration of a recombinant TRIM9 adeno-associated virus that drove brain-wide TRIM9 expression effectively resolved neuroinflammation and alleviated neuronal death, especially in aged mice. These findings reveal that TRIM9 is essential for resolving NF-κB-dependent neuroinflammation to promote recovery and repair after brain injury and may represent an attractive therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is becoming a cornerstone of developmental research, providing unprecedented power in understanding dynamic processes. Here, we present a high-resolution scRNA-seq expression atlas of the Arabidopsis root composed of thousands of independently profiled cells. This atlas provides detailed spatiotemporal information, identifying defining expression features for all major cell types, including the scarce cells of the quiescent center. These reveal key developmental regulators and downstream genes that translate cell fate into distinctive cell shapes and functions. Developmental trajectories derived from pseudotime analysis depict a finely resolved cascade of cell progressions from the niche through differentiation that are supported by mirroring expression waves of highly interconnected transcription factors. This study demonstrates the power of applying scRNA-seq to plants and provides an unparalleled spatiotemporal perspective of root cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The role of stress-induced increases in SUMO2/3 conjugation during the heat shock response (HSR) has remained enigmatic. We investigated SUMO signal transduction at the proteomic and functional level during the HSR in cells depleted of proteostasis network components via chronic heat shock factor 1 inhibition. In the recovery phase post heat shock, high SUMO2/3 conjugation was prolonged in cells lacking sufficient chaperones. Similar results were obtained upon inhibiting HSP90, indicating that increased chaperone activity during the HSR is critical for recovery to normal SUMO2/3 levels post-heat shock. Proteasome inhibition likewise prolonged SUMO2/3 conjugation, indicating that stress-induced SUMO2/3 targets are subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Functionally, we suggest that SUMOylation can enhance the solubility of target proteins upon heat shock, a phenomenon that we experimentally observed in vitro. Collectively, our results implicate SUMO2/3 as a rapid response factor that coordinates proteome degradation and assists the maintenance of proteostasis upon proteotoxic stress.

Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila, 23–30 nt long PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) direct the protein Piwi to silence germline transposon transcription. Most germline piRNAs derive from dual-strand piRNA clusters, heterochromatic transposon graveyards that are transcribed from both genomic strands. These piRNA sources are marked by the heterochromatin protein 1 homolog Rhino (Rhi), which facilitates their promoter-independent transcription, suppresses splicing, and inhibits transcriptional termination. Here, we report that the protein Maelstrom (Mael) represses canonical, promoter-dependent transcription in dual-strand clusters, allowing Rhi to initiate piRNA precursor transcription. Mael also represses promoter-dependent transcription at sites outside clusters. At some loci, Mael repression requires the piRNA pathway, while at others, piRNAs play no role. We propose that by repressing canonical transcription of individual transposon mRNAs, Mael helps Rhi drive non-canonical transcription of piRNA precursors without generating mRNAs encoding transposon proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Adult tissue repair and regeneration require stem-progenitor cells that can self-renew and generate differentiated progeny. Skeletal muscle regenerative capacity relies on muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) and their interplay with different cell types within the niche. However, our understanding of skeletal muscle tissue cellular composition is limited. Here, using a combined approach of single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry, we precisely mapped 10 different mononuclear cell types in adult mouse muscle. We also characterized gene signatures and determined key discriminating markers of each cell type. We identified two previously understudied cell populations in the interstitial compartment. One expresses the transcription factor scleraxis and generated tenocytes in vitro. The second expresses markers of smooth muscle and mesenchymal cells (SMMCs) and, while distinct from MuSCs, exhibited myogenic potential and promoted MuSC engraftment following transplantation. The blueprint presented here yields crucial insights into muscle-resident cell-type identities and can be exploited to study muscle diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and of a significant fraction of adult-onset B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases. Using mouse models and patient-derived samples, we identified an essential role for γ-catenin in the initiation and maintenance of BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL but not CML. The selectivity was explained by a partial γ-catenin dependence of MYC expression together with the susceptibility of B-ALL, but not CML, to reduced MYC levels. MYC and γ-catenin enabled B-ALL maintenance by augmenting BIRC5 and enforced BIRC5 expression overcame γ-catenin loss. Since γ-catenin was dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, these lineage- and disease-specific features of canonical Wnt signaling identified a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL.

Abstract: Most fungi have multiple chitin synthases (CSs) that may make chitin at different sites on the cell surface, at different times during growth, and in response to cell wall stress. The structure-based model for CS function is for transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane to the non-reducing end of a growing chitin chain, which is concomitantly translocated through a transmembrane channel formed by the synthase. Two aspects of CS mechanism are investigated: how chains might be initiated, and what governs how long they can get. First, it is shown that CSs incorporate free GlcNAc into di-N-acetylchitobiose and into insoluble chitin in a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent manner, and therefore that GlcNAc primes chitin synthesis. Second, average lengths of insoluble chitin chains were measured by determining the molar ratio of priming GlcNAc to chain-extending, UDP-GlcNAc-derived GlcNAc, and showed dependence on UDP-GlcNAc concentration, approaching a maximum at higher concentrations of substrate. These results, together with previous findings that 2-acylamido GlcN analogues prime formation of chitin oligosaccharides and stimulate chitin synthesis are discussed in the context of the structure-based model, and lead to the following proposals. 1) CSs may “self-prime” by hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc to yield GlcNAc. 2) A CS’s active site is not continuously occupied by a nascent chitin chain, rather, CSs can release chitin chains, then re-initiate, and therefore synthesize chitin chains in bursts. 3) The length of chitin chains made by a given CS will impact that CS’s contribution to construction of the fungal cell wall.

Abstract: Summary
Delineating molecular and cellular events that precede appendage morphogenesis has been challenging due to the inability to distinguish quantitative molecular differences between cells that lack histological distinction. The hair follicle (HF) dermal condensate (DC) is a cluster of cells critical for HF development and regeneration. Events that presage emergence of this distinctive population are poorly understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing and in vivo methods, we infer a sequence of transcriptional states through which DC cells pass that begins prior to HF morphogenesis. Our data indicate that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required to progress into an intermediate stage that precedes quiescence and differentiation. Further, we provide evidence that quiescent DC cells are recent progeny of selectively proliferating cells present prior to morphogenesis and that are later identified in the peri-DC zone during DC expansion. Together, these findings provide an inferred path of molecular states that lead to DC cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Combinatorial interactions among transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in generating gene expression specificity and diversity in metazoans. Using yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) assays on nearly all sequence-specific Drosophila TFs, we identified 1,983 protein-protein interactions (PPIs), more than doubling the number of currently known PPIs among Drosophila TFs. For quality assessment, we validated a subset of our interactions using MITOMI and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We combined our interactome with prior PPI data to generate an integrated Drosophila TF-TF binary interaction network. Our analysis of ChIP-seq data, integrating PPI and gene expression information, uncovered different modes by which interacting TFs are recruited to DNA. We further demonstrate the utility of our Drosophila interactome in shedding light on human TF-TF interactions. This study reveals how TFs interact to bind regulatory elements in vivo and serves as a resource of Drosophila TF-TF binary PPIs for understanding tissue-specific gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The plasticity of a preexisting regulatory circuit compromises the effectiveness of targeted therapies, and leveraging genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells may overcome such adaptations. Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is characterized by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency caused by fumarate hydratase (FH) nullizyogosity. To identify metabolic genes that are synthetically lethal with OXPHOS deficiency, we conducted a genetic loss-of-function screen and found that phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) inhibition robustly blocks the proliferation of FH mutant cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PGD inhibition blocks glycolysis, suppresses reductive carboxylation of glutamine, and increases the NADP+/NADPH ratio to disrupt redox homeostasis. Furthermore, in the OXPHOS-proficient context, blocking OXPHOS using the small-molecule inhibitor IACS-010759 enhances sensitivity to PGD inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Together, our study reveals a dependency on PGD in OXPHOS-deficient tumors that might inform therapeutic intervention in specific patient populations.

Abstract: Summary
We studied sex differences in over 50 cardio-metabolic traits in a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice. The results clearly showed that the effects of sex on both clinical phenotypes and gene expression depend on the genetic background. In support of this, genetic loci associated with the traits frequently showed sex specificity. For example, Lyplal1, a gene implicated in human obesity, was shown to underlie a sex-specific locus for diet-induced obesity. Global gene expression analyses of tissues across the panel implicated adipose tissue “beiging” and mitochondrial functions in the sex differences. Isolated mitochondria showed gene-by-sex interactions in oxidative functions, such that some strains (C57BL/6J) showed similar function between sexes, whereas others (DBA/2J and A/J) showed increased function in females. Reduced adipose mitochondrial function in males as compared to females was associated with increased susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance. Gonadectomy studies indicated that gonadal hormones acting in a tissue-specific manner were responsible in part for the sex differences.

Abstract: Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is one of the most challenging problems in clinical rhinology. FZD5 is a receptor for Wnt5A, and its complex with Wnt5A contributes to activating inflammation and tissue modification. Nasal polyps and eosinophil/non-eosinophil counts are reported to be directly correlated. This study investigated the expression and distribution of FZD5, and the role of eosinophil infiltration and FZD5 in eosinophilic CRSwNP pathogenesis. The prognostic role of eosinophil levels was evaluated in seven patients with CRSwNP. Fifteen patients with CRS were classified based on the percentage of eosinophils in nasal polyp tissue. Methylated genes were detected using methyl-CpG-binding domain sequencing, and qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect FZD5 expression in nasal polyp tissue samples. The results showed that mRNA expression of FZD5 was upregulated in nasal polyps. FZD5 expression was significantly higher in nasal polyp samples from patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP than in those from patients with non-eosinophilic CRSwNP, as indicated by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine levels were higher in eosinophilic CRSwNP-derived epithelial cells than in normal tissues. In conclusion, FZD5 expression in nasal mucosal epithelial cells is correlated with inflammatory cells and might play a role in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic CRSwNP.

Abstract: Summary
Modulators of mRNA stability are not well understood in melanoma, an aggressive tumor with complex changes in the transcriptome. Here we report the ability of p62/SQSTM1 to extend mRNA half-life of a spectrum of pro-metastatic factors. These include FERMT2 and other transcripts with no previous links to melanoma. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and interactomic analyses, combined with validation in clinical biopsies and mouse models, identified a selected set of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) recruited by p62, with IGF2BP1 as a key partner. This p62-RBP interaction distinguishes melanoma from other tumors where p62 controls autophagy or oxidative stress. The relevance of these data is emphasized by follow-up analyses of patient prognosis revealing p62 and FERMT2 as adverse determinants of disease-free survival.

Abstract: Summary
Meiotic progression in S. pombe is regulated by stage-specific gene expression and translation, changes in RNA stability, expression of anti-sense transcripts, and targeted proteolysis of regulatory proteins. We have used SILAC labeling to examine the relative levels of proteins in diploid S. pombe cells during meiosis. Among the 3,268 proteins quantified at all time points, the levels of 880 proteins changed at least 2-fold; the majority of proteins showed stepwise increases or decreases during the meiotic divisions, while some changed transiently. Overall, we observed reductions in proteins involved in anabolism and increases in proteins involved in catabolism. We also observed increases in the levels of proteins of the ESCRT-III complex and revealed a role for ESCRT-III components in chromosome segregation and spore formation. Correlation with studies of meiotic gene expression and ribosome occupancy reveals that many of the changes in steady-state protein levels are post-transcriptional.

Abstract: Summary
Caveolae, flask-shaped pits covered by caveolin-cavin coats, are abundant features of the plasma membrane of many cells. Besides appearing as single-membrane indentations, caveolae are organized as superstructures in the form of rosette-like clusters, whose mechanism of assembly and biological functions have been elusive. Here, we propose that clustering of caveolae in mature muscle cells is driven by forces originating from the elastic energy of membrane-bending deformations and membrane tension. We substantiate this mechanism by computational modeling, which recovers the unique shapes observed for the most ubiquitous caveolar clusters. We support the agreement between the calculated and observed configurations by electron tomography of caveolar clusters. The model predicts the experimentally assessable dependence of caveolar clustering on membrane tension and on the degree of the caveolar coat assembly. We reveal a difference in conformation and, possibly, in function and formation mechanism between caveolar clusters of muscle cells and of adipocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Tryptophan as the precursor of several active compounds, including kynurenine and serotonin, is critical for numerous important metabolic functions. Enhanced tryptophan metabolism toward the kynurenine pathway has been associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), which are preleukemic clonal diseases characterized by dysplastic bone marrow and cytopenias. Here, we reveal a fundamental role for tryptophan metabolized along the serotonin pathway in normal erythropoiesis and in the physiopathology of MDS-related anemia. We identify, both in human and murine erythroid progenitors, a functional cell-autonomous serotonergic network with pro-survival and proliferative functions. In vivo studies demonstrate that pharmacological increase of serotonin levels using fluoxetine, a common antidepressant, has the potential to become an important therapeutic strategy in low-risk MDS anemia refractory to erythropoietin.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ play important roles in development, physiology, and tumorigenesis and are negatively controlled by the Hippo pathway. It is yet unknown why the YAP/ TAZ proteins are frequently activated in human malignancies in which the Hippo pathway is still active. Here, by a gain-of-function cancer metastasis screen, we discovered OTUB2 as a cancer stemness and metastasis-promoting factor that deubiquitinates and activates YAP/TAZ. We found OTUB2 to be poly-SUMOylated on lysine 233, and this SUMOylation enables it to bind YAP/TAZ. We also identified a yet-unknown SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in YAP and TAZ required for their association with SUMOylated OTUB2. Importantly, EGF and oncogenic KRAS induce OTUB2 poly-SUMOylation and thereby activate YAP/TAZ. Our results establish OTUB2 as an essential modulator of YAP/TAZ and also reveal a novel mechanism via which YAP/TAZ activity is induced by oncogenic KRAS.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin is a conserved, ring-shaped protein complex that topologically embraces DNA. Its central role in genome organization includes functions in sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. Cohesin loading onto chromosomes requires the Scc2-Scc4 cohesin loader, whose presence on chromatin in budding yeast depends on the RSC chromatin remodeling complex. Here we reveal a dual role of RSC in cohesin loading. RSC acts as a chromatin receptor that recruits Scc2-Scc4 by a direct protein interaction independent of chromatin remodeling. In addition, chromatin remodeling is required to generate a nucleosome-free region that is the substrate for cohesin loading. An engineered cohesin loading module can be created by fusing the Scc2 C terminus to RSC or to other chromatin remodelers, but not to unrelated DNA binding proteins. These observations demonstrate the importance of nucleosome-free DNA for cohesin loading and provide insight into how cohesin accesses DNA during its varied chromosomal activities.

Abstract: Summary
The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) harbors adult neural stem cells. V-SVZ neural stem cells exhibit features of astrocytes, have a regional identity, and depending on their location in the lateral or septal wall of the lateral ventricle, generate different types of neuronal and glial progeny. We performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a molecular atlas of cells from the lateral and septal adult V-SVZ of male and female mice. This revealed regional and sex differences among adult V-SVZ cells. We uncovered lineage potency bias at the single-cell level among lateral and septal wall astrocytes toward neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis, respectively. Finally, we identified transcription factor co-expression modules marking key temporal steps in neurogenic and oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Our data suggest functionally important spatial diversity in neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the adult brain and reveal molecular correlates of adult NSC dormancy and lineage specialization.

Abstract: Summary
FTO, an mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase, was reported to promote leukemogenesis. Using structure-based rational design, we have developed two promising FTO inhibitors, namely FB23 and FB23-2, which directly bind to FTO and selectively inhibit FTO's m6A demethylase activity. Mimicking FTO depletion, FB23-2 dramatically suppresses proliferation and promotes the differentiation/apoptosis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line cells and primary blast AML cells in vitro. Moreover, FB23-2 significantly inhibits the progression of human AML cell lines and primary cells in xeno-transplanted mice. Collectively, our data suggest that FTO is a druggable target and that targeting FTO by small-molecule inhibitors holds potential to treat AML.
