Abstract: Summary
Although the role of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in extracellular RNA (exRNA) biology is well established, their exRNA cargo and distribution across biofluids are largely unknown. To address this gap, we extend the exRNA Atlas resource by mapping exRNAs carried by extracellular RBPs (exRBPs). This map was developed through an integrative analysis of ENCODE enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) data (150 RBPs) and human exRNA profiles (6,930 samples). Computational analysis and experimental validation identified exRBPs in plasma, serum, saliva, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and cell-culture-conditioned medium. exRBPs carry exRNA transcripts from small non-coding RNA biotypes, including microRNA (miRNA), piRNA, tRNA, small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), Y RNA, and lncRNA, as well as protein-coding mRNA fragments. Computational deconvolution of exRBP RNA cargo reveals associations of exRBPs with extracellular vesicles, lipoproteins, and ribonucleoproteins across human biofluids. Overall, we mapped the distribution of exRBPs across human biofluids, presenting a resource for the community.

Abstract: Summary
Intermittent fasting (IF) is an established intervention to treat the growing obesity epidemic. However, the interaction between dietary interventions and sex remains a significant knowledge gap. In this study, we use unbiased proteome analysis to identify diet-sex interactions. We report sexual dimorphism in response to intermittent fasting within lipid and cholesterol metabolism and, unexpectedly, in type I interferon signaling, which was strongly induced in females. We verify that secretion of type I interferon is required for the IF response in females. Gonadectomy differentially alters the every-other-day fasting (EODF) response and demonstrates that sex hormone signaling can either suppress or enhance the interferon response to IF. IF fails to potentiate a stronger innate immune response when IF-treated animals were challenged with a viral mimetic. Lastly, the IF response changes with genotype and environment. These data reveal an interesting interaction between diet, sex, and the innate immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have revealed the heterogeneous nature of astrocytes; however, how diverse constituents of astrocyte-lineage cells are regulated in adult spinal cord after injury and contribute to regeneration remains elusive. We perform single-cell RNA sequencing of GFAP-expressing cells from sub-chronic spinal cord injury models and identify and compare with the subpopulations in acute-stage data. We find subpopulations with distinct functional enrichment and their identities defined by subpopulation-specific transcription factors and regulons. Immunohistochemistry, RNAscope experiments, and quantification by stereology verify the molecular signature, location, and morphology of potential resident neural progenitors or neural stem cells in the adult spinal cord before and after injury and uncover the populations of the intermediate cells enriched in neuronal genes that could potentially transition into other subpopulations. This study has expanded the knowledge of the heterogeneity and cell state transition of glial progenitors in adult spinal cord before and after injury.

Abstract: Cellular homeostasis is crucial for the healthy functioning of the organism. Disruption of cellular homeostasis activates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress coping responses including the unfolded protein response (UPR). There are three ER resident stress sensors responsible for UPR activation - IRE1α, PERK and ATF6. Ca2+ signaling plays an important role in stress responses including the UPR and the ER is the main Ca2+ storage organelle and a source of Ca2+ for cell signaling. The ER contains many proteins involved in Ca2+ import/export/ storage, Ca2+ movement between different cellular organelles and ER Ca2+ stores refilling. Here we focus on selected aspects of ER Ca2+ homeostasis and its role in activation of the ER stress coping responses.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs) is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated diseases. However, there are no scalable approaches to comprehensively assess the diverse FFAs circulating in human plasma. Furthermore, assessing how FFA-mediated processes interact with genetic risk for disease remains elusive. Here, we report the design and implementation of fatty acid library for comprehensive ontologies (FALCON), an unbiased, scalable, and multimodal interrogation of 61 structurally diverse FFAs. We identified a subset of lipotoxic monounsaturated fatty acids associated with decreased membrane fluidity. Furthermore, we prioritized genes that reflect the combined effects of harmful FFA exposure and genetic risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). We found that c-MAF-inducing protein (CMIP) protects cells from FFA exposure by modulating Akt signaling. In sum, FALCON empowers the study of fundamental FFA biology and offers an integrative approach to identify much needed targets for diverse diseases associated with disordered FFA metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by depletion of Lactobacillus and overgrowth of anaerobic and facultative bacteria, leading to increased mucosal inflammation, epithelial disruption, and poor reproductive health outcomes. However, the molecular mediators contributing to vaginal epithelial dysfunction are poorly understood. Here we utilize proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize biological features underlying BV in 405 African women and explore functional mechanisms in vitro. We identify five major vaginal microbiome groups: L. crispatus (21%), L. iners (18%), Lactobacillus (9%), Gardnerella (30%), and polymicrobial (22%). Using multi-omics we show that BV-associated epithelial disruption and mucosal inflammation link to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and associate with Gardnerella, M. mulieris, and specific metabolites including imidazole propionate. Experiments in vitro confirm that type strain G. vaginalis and M. mulieris supernatants and imidazole propionate directly affect epithelial barrier function and activation of mTOR pathways. These results find that the microbiome-mTOR axis is a central feature of epithelial dysfunction in BV.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer remains an area of unmet clinical need. We recently identified a subpopulation of normal prostate progenitor cells, characterized by an intrinsic resistance to androgen deprivation and expression of LY6D. We here demonstrate that conditional deletion of PTEN in the murine prostate epithelium causes an expansion of transformed LY6D+ progenitor cells without impairing stem cell properties. Transcriptomic analyses of LY6D+ luminal cells identified an autocrine positive feedback loop, based on the secretion of amphiregulin (AREG)-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, increasing cellular fitness and organoid formation. Pharmacological interference with this pathway overcomes the castration-resistant properties of LY6D+ cells with a suppression of organoid formation and loss of LY6D+ cells in vivo. Notably, LY6D+ tumor cells are enriched in high-grade and androgen-resistant prostate cancer, providing clinical evidence for their contribution to advanced disease. Our data indicate that early interference with MAPK inhibitors can prevent progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Most human proteins lack chemical probes, and several large-scale and generalizable small-molecule binding assays have been introduced to address this problem. How compounds discovered in such “binding-first” assays affect protein function, nonetheless, often remains unclear. Here, we describe a “function-first” proteomic strategy that uses size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to assess the global impact of electrophilic compounds on protein complexes in human cells. Integrating the SEC data with cysteine-directed activity-based protein profiling identifies changes in protein-protein interactions that are caused by site-specific liganding events, including the stereoselective engagement of cysteines in PSME1 and SF3B1 that disrupt the PA28 proteasome regulatory complex and stabilize a dynamic state of the spliceosome, respectively. Our findings thus show how multidimensional proteomic analysis of focused libraries of electrophilic compounds can expedite the discovery of chemical probes with site-specific functional effects on protein complexes in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Organismal homeostasis and regeneration are predicated on committed stem cells that can reside for long periods in a mitotically dormant but reversible cell-cycle arrest state defined as quiescence. Premature escape from quiescence is detrimental, as it results in stem cell depletion, with consequent defective tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Here, we report that Polycomb Ezh1 confers quiescence to murine muscle stem cells (MuSCs) through a non-canonical function. In the absence of Ezh1, MuSCs spontaneously exit quiescence. Following repeated injuries, the MuSC pool is progressively depleted, resulting in failure to sustain proper muscle regeneration. Rather than regulating repressive histone H3K27 methylation, Ezh1 maintains gene expression of the Notch signaling pathway in MuSCs. Selective genetic reconstitution of the Notch signaling corrects stem cell number and re-establishes quiescence of Ezh1−/− MuSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Fibronectin fibrillogenesis and mechanosensing both depend on integrin-mediated force transmission to the extracellular matrix. However, force transmission is in itself dependent on fibrillogenesis, and fibronectin fibrils are found in soft embryos where high forces cannot be applied, suggesting that force cannot be the sole initiator of fibrillogenesis. Here, we identify a nucleation step prior to force transmission, driven by fibronectin oxidation mediated by lysyl oxidase enzyme family members. This oxidation induces fibronectin clustering, which promotes early adhesion, alters cellular response to soft matrices, and enhances force transmission to the matrix. In contrast, absence of fibronectin oxidation abrogates fibrillogenesis, perturbs cell-matrix adhesion, and compromises mechanosensation. Moreover, fibronectin oxidation promotes cancer cell colony formation in soft agar as well as collective and single-cell migration. These results reveal a force-independent enzyme-dependent mechanism that initiates fibronectin fibrillogenesis, establishing a critical step in cell adhesion and mechanosensing.

Abstract: Summary
The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of primates is thought to play a role in associative learning. However, it remains unclear how LPFC neuronal ensembles dynamically encode and store memories for arbitrary stimulus-response associations. We recorded the activity of neurons in LPFC of two macaques during an associative learning task using multielectrode arrays. During task trials, the color of a symbolic cue indicated the location of one of two possible targets for a saccade. During a trial block, multiple randomly chosen associations were learned by the subjects. A state-space analysis indicated that LPFC neuronal ensembles rapidly learn new stimulus-response associations mirroring the animals’ learning. Multiple associations acquired during training are stored in a neuronal subspace and can be retrieved hours after learning. Finally, knowledge of old associations facilitates learning new, similar associations. These results indicate that neuronal ensembles in the primate LPFC provide a flexible and dynamic substrate for associative learning.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cytosine deaminase DddAtox-derived cytosine base editor (DdCBE) and its evolved variant, DddA11, guided by transcription-activator-like effector (TALE) proteins, enable mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) editing at TC or HC (H = A, C, or T) sequence contexts, while it remains relatively unattainable for GC targets. Here, we identified a dsDNA deaminase originated from a Roseburia intestinalis interbacterial toxin (riDddAtox) and generated CRISPR-mediated nuclear DdCBEs (crDdCBEs) and mitochondrial CBEs (mitoCBEs) using split riDddAtox, which catalyzed C-to-T editing at both HC and GC targets in nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Moreover, transactivator (VP64, P65, or Rta) fusion to the tail of DddAtox- or riDddAtox-mediated crDdCBEs and mitoCBEs substantially improved nuclear and mtDNA editing efficiencies by up to 3.5- and 1.7-fold, respectively. We also used riDddAtox-based and Rta-assisted mitoCBE to efficiently stimulate disease-associated mtDNA mutations in cultured cells and in mouse embryos with conversion frequencies of up to 58% at non-TC targets.

Abstract: Summary
2′,3′-cGAMP, produced by the DNA sensor cGAS, activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and triggers immune response during infection. Tremendous effort has been placed on unraveling the mechanism of STING activation. However, little is known about STING inhibition. Here, we found that apo-STING exhibits a bilayer with head-to-head as well as side-by-side packing, mediated by its ligand-binding domain (LBD). This type of assembly holds two endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes together not only to prevent STING ER exit but also to eliminate the recruitment of TBK1, representing the autoinhibited state of STING. Additionally, we obtained the filament structure of the STING/2′,3′-cGAMP complex, which adopts a bent monolayer assembly mediated by LBD and transmembrane domain (TMD). The active, curved STING polymer could deform ER membrane to support its ER exit and anterograde transportation. Our data together provide a panoramic vision regarding STING autoinhibition and activation, which adds substantially to current understanding of the cGAS-STING pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) correlates with tumor-infiltrating cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) prior to treatment. However, many of these inflamed tumors resist ICB through unknown mechanisms. We show that tumors with transcription elongation deficiencies (TEdef+), which we previously reported as being resistant to ICB in mouse models and the clinic, have high baseline CTLs. We show that high baseline CTLs in TEdef+ tumors result from aberrant activation of the nucleic acid sensing-TBK1-CCL5/CXCL9 signaling cascade, which results in an immunosuppressive microenvironment with elevated regulatory T cells and exhausted CTLs. ICB therapy of TEdef+ tumors fail to increase CTL infiltration and suppress tumor growth in both experimental and clinical settings, suggesting that TEdef+, along with surrogate markers of tumor immunogenicity such as tumor mutational burden and CTLs, should be considered in the decision process for patient immunotherapy indication.

Abstract: Summary
CD69+CD103+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are important drivers of inflammation. To decipher their role in inflammatory arthritis, we apply single-cell, high-dimensional profiling to T cells from the joints of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We identify three groups of synovial CD8+CD69+CD103+ TRM cells: cytotoxic and regulatory T (Treg)-like TRM cells are present in both PsA and RA, while CD161+CCR6+ type 17-like TRM cells with a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile (IL-17A+TNFα+IFNγ+) are specifically enriched in PsA. In contrast, only one population of CD4+CD69+CD103+ TRM cells is detected and at similarly low frequencies in both diseases. Type 17-like CD8+ TRM cells have a distinct transcriptomic signature and a polyclonal, but distinct, TCR repertoire. Type 17-like cells are also enriched in CD8+CD103− T cells in PsA compared with RA. These findings illustrate differences in the immunopathology of PsA and RA, with a particular enrichment for type 17 CD8+ T cells in the PsA joint.

Abstract: The discovery and study of adult stem cells have revolutionized regenerative medicine by offering new opportunities for treating various medical conditions. Anamniote stem cells, which retain their full proliferative capacity and full differentiation range throughout their lifetime, harbour a greater potential compared to mammalian adult stem cells, which only exhibit limited stem cell potential. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying these differences is of significant interest. In this review, we examine the similarities and differences of adult retinal stem cells in anamniotes and mammals, from their embryonic stages in the optic vesicle to their residence in the postembryonic retinal stem cell niche, the ciliary marginal zone located in the retinal periphery. In anamniotes, developing precursors of retinal stem cells are exposed to various environmental cues during their migration in the complex morphogenetic remodelling of the optic vesicle to the optic cup. In contrast, their mammalian counterparts in the retinal periphery are primarily instructed by neighbouring tissues once they are in place. We explore the distinct modes of optic cup morphogenesis in mammals and teleost fish and highlight molecular mechanisms governing morphogenesis and stem cells instruction. The review concludes with the molecular mechanisms of ciliary marginal zone formation and offers a perspective on the impact of comparative single cell transcriptomic studies to reveal the evolutionary similarities and differences.

Abstract: Summary
Growth hormone (GH) acts via JAK2 and LYN to regulate growth, metabolism, and neural function. However, the relationship between these tyrosine kinases remains enigmatic. Through an interdisciplinary approach combining cell biology, structural biology, computation, and single-particle tracking on live cells, we find overlapping LYN and JAK2 Box1-Box2-binding regions in GH receptor (GHR). Our data implicate direct competition between JAK2 and LYN for GHR binding and imply divergent signaling profiles. We show that GHR exhibits distinct mobility states within the cell membrane and that activation of LYN by GH mediates GHR immobilization, thereby initiating its nanoclustering in the membrane. Importantly, we observe that LYN mediates cytokine receptor degradation, thereby controlling receptor turnover and activity, and this applies to related cytokine receptors. Our study offers insight into the molecular interactions of LYN with GHR and highlights important functions for LYN in regulating GHR nanoclustering, signaling, and degradation, traits broadly relevant to many cytokine receptors.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular and pathogenic mechanisms of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) development are still unclear, which hinders the development of effective treatments. In this study, we report that DUSP4 is highly expressed in human ESCC and is negatively correlated with patient prognosis. Knockdown of DUSP4 suppresses cell proliferation and patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived organoid (PDXO) growth and inhibits cell-derived xenograft (CDX) development. Mechanistically, DUSP4 directly binds to heat shock protein isoform β (HSP90β) and promotes the ATPase activity of HSP90β by dephosphorylating HSP90β on T214 and Y216. These dephosphorylation sites are critical for the stability of JAK1/2-STAT3 signaling and p-STAT3 (Y705) nucleus translocation. In vivo, Dusp4 knockout in mice significantly inhibits 4-nitrochinoline-oxide-induced esophageal tumorigenesis. Moreover, DUSP4 lentivirus or treatment with HSP90β inhibitor (NVP-BEP800) significantly impedes PDX tumor growth and inactivates the JAK1/2-STAT3 signaling pathway. These data provide insight into the role of the DUSP4-HSP90β-JAK1/2-STAT3 axis in ESCC progression and describe a strategy for ESCC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic antibodies are an important tool in the arsenal against coronavirus infection. However, most antibodies developed early in the pandemic have lost most or all efficacy against newly emergent strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), particularly those of the Omicron lineage. Here, we report the identification of a panel of vaccinee-derived antibodies that have broad-spectrum neutralization activity. Structural and biochemical characterization of the three broadest-spectrum antibodies reveal complementary footprints and differing requirements for avidity to overcome variant-associated mutations in their binding footprints. In the K18 mouse model of infection, these three antibodies exhibit protective efficacy against BA.1 and BA.2 infection. This study highlights the resilience and vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and provides road maps for further development of broad-spectrum therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is classically conceptualized as an ever-increasing trajectory of damage accumulation and loss of function, leading to increases in morbidity and mortality. However, recent in vitro studies have raised the possibility of age reversal. Here, we report that biological age is fluid and exhibits rapid changes in both directions. At epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic levels, we find that the biological age of young mice is increased by heterochronic parabiosis and restored following surgical detachment. We also identify transient changes in biological age during major surgery, pregnancy, and severe COVID-19 in humans and/or mice. Together, these data show that biological age undergoes a rapid increase in response to diverse forms of stress, which is reversed following recovery from stress. Our study uncovers a new layer of aging dynamics that should be considered in future studies. The elevation of biological age by stress may be a quantifiable and actionable target for future interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Vocalizations play an important role in the daily life of primates and likely form the basis of human language. Functional imaging studies have demonstrated that listening to voices activates a fronto-temporal voice perception network in human participants. Here, we acquired whole-brain ultrahigh-field (9.4 T) fMRI in awake marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and demonstrate that these small, highly vocal New World primates possess a similar fronto-temporal network, including subcortical regions, that is activated by the presentation of conspecific vocalizations. The findings suggest that the human voice perception network has evolved from an ancestral vocalization-processing network that predates the separation of New and Old World primates.

Abstract: Summary
Formation of epithelia through mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) is essential for embryonic development and for many physiological and pathological processes. This study investigates MET in vivo in the chick embryo lateral mesoderm, where a multilayered mesenchyme transforms into two parallel epithelial sheets that constitute the coelomic lining of the embryonic body cavity. Prior to MET initiation, mesenchymal cells exhibit non-polarized distribution of multiple polarity markers, albeit not aPKC. We identified an epithelializing wave that sweeps across the lateral mesoderm, the wavefront of which is characterized by the accumulation of basal fibronectin and a network of 3D rosettes composed of polarized, wedge-shaped cells surrounding a central focus of apical markers, now including aPKC. Initiation of the MET process is dependent on extracellular matrix-integrin signaling acting through focal adhesion kinase and talin, whereas progression through the rosette phase requires aPKC function. We present a stepwise model for MET, comprising polarization, 3D-rosette, and epithelialization stages.

Abstract: Summary
An abundance of research has recently highlighted the susceptibility of cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) neurons to noise damage and aging in the adult cochlea, resulting in hearing deficits. Furthering our understanding of the transcriptional cascades that contribute to CVG development may provide insight into how these cells can be regenerated to treat inner ear dysfunction. Here we perform a high-depth single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the E10.5 otic vesicle and its surrounding tissues, including CVG precursor neuroblasts and emerging CVG neurons. Clustering and trajectory analysis of otic-lineage cells reveals otic markers and the changes in gene expression that occur from neuroblast delamination toward the development of the CVG. This dataset provides a valuable resource for further identifying the mechanisms associated with CVG development from neurosensory competent cells within the otic vesicle.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) drive healthy visceral adipose tissue (VAT) expansion via adipocyte hyperplasia. Obesity induces ASC senescence that causes VAT dysfunction and metabolic disorders. It is challenging to restrain this process by biological intervention, as mechanisms of controlling VAT ASC senescence remain unclear. We demonstrate that a population of CX3CR1hi macrophages is maintained in mouse VAT during short-term energy surplus, which sustains ASCs by restraining their senescence, driving adaptive VAT expansion and metabolic health. Long-term overnutrition induces diminishment of CX3CR1hi macrophages in mouse VAT accompanied by ASC senescence and exhaustion, while transferring CX3CR1hi macrophages restores ASC reservoir and triggers VAT beiging to alleviate the metabolic maladaptation. Mechanistically, visceral ASCs attract macrophages via MCP-1 and shape their CX3CR1hi phenotype via exosomes; these macrophages relieve ASC senescence by promoting the arginase1-eIF5A hypusination axis. These findings identify VAT CX3CR1hi macrophages as ASC supporters and unravel their therapeutic potential for metabolic maladaptation to obesity.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) protein is a Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel known for its pain modulation pathway. In a previous study, it was discovered that a triple-transgenic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse model (3xTg-AD+/+) has anti-AD effects. The expression of proteins in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) pathway in a 3xTg-AD/TRPV1 transgenic mice model was investigated to better understand the AD regulatory effect of TRPV1 deficiency. The results show that TRPV1 deficiency leads to CREB activation by increasing BDNF levels and promoting phosphorylation of tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), and CREB in the hippocampus. Additionally, TRPV1 deficiency-induced CREB activation increases the antiapoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) gene, which consequently downregulates Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) expression and decreases cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which leads to the prevention of hippocampal apoptosis. In conclusion, TRPV1 deficiency exhibits neuroprotective effects by preventing apoptosis through the BDNF/CREB signal transduction pathway in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice.

Abstract: Adhesion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to the bone marrow niche plays critical roles in the maintenance of the most primitive HSPCs. The interactions of HSPC−niche interactions are clinically relevant in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), because (i) leukemia-initiating cells adhered to the marrow niche are protected from the cytotoxic effect by chemotherapy and (ii) mobilization of HSPCs from healthy donors' bone marrow is crucial for the effective stem cell transplantation. However, although many clinical agents have been developed for the HSPC mobilization, the effects caused by the extrinsic molecular cues were traditionally evaluated based on phenomenological observations. This review highlights the recent interdisciplinary challenges of hematologists, biophysicists and cell biologists towards the design of defined in vitro niche models and the development of physical biomarkers for quantitative indexing of differential effects of clinical agents on human HSPCs.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites are crucial to allow Ca2+ flux between them and a plethora of proteins participate in tethering both organelles together. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) play a pivotal role at such contact sites, participating in both ER-mitochondria tethering and as Ca2+-transport system that delivers Ca2+ from the ER towards mitochondria. At the ER-mitochondria contact sites, the IP3Rs function as a multi-protein complex linked to the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in the outer mitochondrial membrane, via the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75). This IP3R-GRP75-VDAC1 complex supports the efficient transfer of Ca2+ from the ER into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, from which the Ca2+ ions can reach the mitochondrial matrix through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. Under physiological conditions, basal Ca2+ oscillations deliver Ca2+ to the mitochondrial matrix, thereby stimulating mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. However, when mitochondrial Ca2+ overload occurs, the increase in [Ca2+] will induce the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, thereby provoking cell death. The IP3R-GRP75-VDAC1 complex forms a hub for several other proteins that stabilize the complex and/or regulate the complex's ability to channel Ca2+ into the mitochondria. These proteins and their mechanisms of action are discussed in the present review with special attention for their role in pathological conditions and potential implication for therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its pivotal roles in biology, how the transcriptional activity of c-MYC is tuned quantitatively remains poorly defined. Here, we show that heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response, acts as a prime modifier of the c-MYC-mediated transcription. HSF1 deficiency diminishes c-MYC DNA binding and dampens its transcriptional activity genome wide. Mechanistically, c-MYC, MAX, and HSF1 assemble into a transcription factor complex on genomic DNAs, and surprisingly, the DNA binding of HSF1 is dispensable. Instead, HSF1 physically recruits the histone acetyltransferase general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), promoting histone acetylation and augmenting c-MYC transcriptional activity. Thus, we find that HSF1 specifically potentiates the c-MYC-mediated transcription, discrete from its canonical role in countering proteotoxic stress. Importantly, this mechanism of action engenders two distinct c-MYC activation states, primary and advanced, which may be important to accommodate diverse physiological and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein-1) is a T cell-intrinsic checkpoint regulator of exhaustion with an unknown mechanism of action. Here, we show that PSGL-1 acts upstream of PD-1 and requires co-ligation with the T cell receptor (TCR) to attenuate activation of mouse and human CD8+ T cells and drive terminal T cell exhaustion. PSGL-1 directly restrains TCR signaling via Zap70 and maintains expression of the Zap70 inhibitor Sts-1. PSGL-1 deficiency empowers CD8+ T cells to respond to low-affinity TCR ligands and inhibit growth of PD-1-blockade-resistant melanoma by enabling tumor-infiltrating T cells to sustain an elevated metabolic gene signature supportive of increased glycolysis and glucose uptake to promote effector function. This outcome is coupled to an increased abundance of CD8+ T cell stem cell-like progenitors that maintain effector functions. Additionally, pharmacologic blockade of PSGL-1 curtails T cell exhaustion, indicating that PSGL-1 represents an immunotherapeutic target for PD-1-blockade-resistant tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear envelope (NE) assembly defects cause chromosome fragmentation, cancer, and aging. However, major questions about the mechanism of NE assembly and its relationship to nuclear pathology are unresolved. In particular, how cells efficiently assemble the NE starting from vastly different, cell type-specific endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphologies is unclear. Here, we identify a NE assembly mechanism, “membrane infiltration,” that defines one end of a continuum with another NE assembly mechanism, “lateral sheet expansion,” in human cells. Membrane infiltration involves the recruitment of ER tubules or small sheets to the chromatin surface by mitotic actin filaments. Lateral sheet expansion involves actin-independent envelopment of peripheral chromatin by large ER sheets that then extend over chromatin within the spindle. We propose a “tubule-sheet continuum” model that explains the efficient NE assembly from any starting ER morphology, the cell type-specific patterns of nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly, and the obligatory NPC assembly defect of micronuclei.

Abstract: Summary
The hematopoietic niche is a supportive microenvironment composed of distinct cell types, including specialized vascular endothelial cells that directly interact with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The molecular factors that specify niche endothelial cells and orchestrate HSPC homeostasis remain largely unknown. Using multi-dimensional gene expression and chromatin accessibility analyses in zebrafish, we define a conserved gene expression signature and cis-regulatory landscape that are unique to sinusoidal endothelial cells in the HSPC niche. Using enhancer mutagenesis and transcription factor overexpression, we elucidate a transcriptional code that involves members of the Ets, Sox, and nuclear hormone receptor families and is sufficient to induce ectopic niche endothelial cells that associate with mesenchymal stromal cells and support the recruitment, maintenance, and division of HSPCs in vivo. These studies set forth an approach for generating synthetic HSPC niches, in vitro or in vivo, and for effective therapies to modulate the endogenous niche.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence indicates that metabolic dysregulation drives prostate cancer (PCa) progression and metastasis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of metabolism, although its role in PCa remains unclear. Here, we show that genetic and pharmacological activation of AMPK provides a protective effect on PCa progression in vivo. We show that AMPK activation induces PGC1α expression, leading to catabolic metabolic reprogramming of PCa cells. This catabolic state is characterized by increased mitochondrial gene expression, increased fatty acid oxidation, decreased lipogenic potential, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased cell invasiveness. Together, these changes inhibit PCa disease progression. Additionally, we identify a gene network involved in cell cycle regulation that is inhibited by AMPK activation. Strikingly, we show a correlation between this gene network and PGC1α gene expression in human PCa. Taken together, our findings support the use of AMPK activators for clinical treatment of PCa to improve patient outcome.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic variation contributes greatly to LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and coronary artery disease risk. By combining analysis of rare coding variants from the UK Biobank and genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and activation screening, we substantially improve the identification of genes whose disruption alters serum LDL-C levels. We identify 21 genes in which rare coding variants significantly alter LDL-C levels at least partially through altered LDL-C uptake. We use co-essentiality-based gene module analysis to show that dysfunction of the RAB10 vesicle transport pathway leads to hypercholesterolemia in humans and mice by impairing surface LDL receptor levels. Further, we demonstrate that loss of function of OTX2 leads to robust reduction in serum LDL-C levels in mice and humans by increasing cellular LDL-C uptake. Altogether, we present an integrated approach that improves our understanding of the genetic regulators of LDL-C levels and provides a roadmap for further efforts to dissect complex human disease genetics.

Abstract: Complications caused by Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), including infertility, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and depression, severely affect the life quality of female patients. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can alleviate some long-term complications, there is still no standard treatment for the restoration of ovarian reserve function. Currently, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSC) transplantation showed considerable treatment effect for POI in both rat model and clinic. To improve the effectiveness of naïve HUCMSC (HUCMSC-Null) treatments on POI, an exogenous gene hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) which promotes follicular angiogenesis in POI ovaries was used to modify HUCMSC. Subsequently, HGF-overexpressed HUCMSC (HUCMSC-HGF) was transplanted into the ovaries of chemotherapy-induced POI Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to observe the effectiveness on POI improvement and its related mechanisms. Our results showed that when compared with POI and HUCMSC-Null treatment group, HUCMSC-HGF significantly improved ovarian reserve function in POI group, which might be attributed to the decrease of ovarian tissue fibrosis and granulosa cells (GCs) apoptosis, and the increase of ovarian angiogenesis mediated by HGF over-expression. The findings suggest that HGF-modified HUCMSC may present a more superior capacity than HUCMSC alone for the rescue of ovarian reserve function in POI.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle is highly developed after birth, consisting of glycolytic fast-twitch and oxidative slow-twitch fibers; however, the mechanisms of fiber-type-specific differentiation are poorly understood. Here, we found an unexpected role of mitochondrial fission in the differentiation of fast-twitch oxidative fibers. Depletion of the mitochondrial fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in mouse skeletal muscle and cultured myotubes results in specific reduction of fast-twitch muscle fibers independent of respiratory function. Altered mitochondrial fission causes activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway via mitochondrial accumulation of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), and rapamycin administration rescues the reduction of fast-twitch fibers in vivo and in vitro. Under Akt/mTOR activation, the mitochondria-related cytokine growth differentiation factor 15 is upregulated, which represses fast-twitch fiber differentiation. Our findings reveal a crucial role of mitochondrial dynamics in the activation of mTORC2 on mitochondria, resulting in the differentiation of muscle fibers.

Abstract: Summary
Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs) reduce the effectiveness of immune responses in cancer. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), precursors to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promote tumor progression by enhancing immune cell suppression in colorectal cancer (CRC). Hyper-sialylation of glycans promotes immune evasion in cancer through binding of sialic acids to their receptors, Siglecs, expressed on immune cells, which results in inhibition of effector functions. The role of sialylation in shaping MSC/CAF immunosuppression in the TME is not well characterized. In this study, we show that tumor-conditioned stromal cells have increased sialyltransferase expression, α2,3/6-linked sialic acid, and Siglec ligands. Tumor-conditioned stromal cells and CAFs induce exhausted immunomodulatory CD8+ PD1+ and CD8+ Siglec-7+/Siglec-9+ T cell phenotypes. In vivo, targeting stromal cell sialylation reverses stromal cell-mediated immunosuppression, as shown by infiltration of CD25 and granzyme B-expressing CD8+ T cells in the tumor and draining lymph node. Targeting stromal cell sialylation may overcome immunosuppression in the CRC TME.

Abstract: Plants produce the major part of terrestrial biomass and are long-term deposits of atmospheric carbon. This capacity is to a large extent due to radial growth of woody species – a process driven by cambium stem cells located in distinct niches of shoot and root axes. In the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, thousands of cells are produced by the cambium in radial orientation generating a complex organ anatomy enabling long-distance transport, mechanical support and protection against biotic and abiotic stressors. These complex organ dynamics make a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of radial growth challenging and asks for tools for automated quantification. Here, we combined the recently developed PlantSeg and MorphographX image analysis tools, to characterize tissue morphogenesis of the Arabidopsis hypocotyl. After sequential training of segmentation models on ovules, shoot apical meristems and adult hypocotyls using deep machine learning, followed by the training of cell type classification models, our pipeline segments complex images of transverse hypocotyl sections with high accuracy and classifies central hypocotyl cell types. By applying our pipeline on both wild type and phloem intercalated with xylem (pxy) mutants, we also show that this strategy faithfully detects major anatomical aberrations. Collectively, we conclude that our established pipeline is a powerful phenotyping tool comprehensively extracting cellular parameters and providing access to tissue topology during radial plant growth.

Abstract: Summary
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination is a prototype model for the study of trained immunity (TI) in humans, and results in a more effective response of innate immune cells upon stimulation with heterologous stimuli. Here, we investigate the heterogeneity of TI induction by single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells collected from 156 samples. We observe that both monocytes and CD8+ T cells show heterologous transcriptional responses to lipopolysaccharide, with an active crosstalk between these two cell types. Furthermore, the interferon-γ pathway is crucial in BCG-induced TI, and it is upregulated in functional high responders. Data-driven analyses and functional experiments reveal STAT1 to be one of the important transcription factors for TI shared in all identified monocyte subpopulations. Finally, we report the role of type I interferon-related and neutrophil-related TI transcriptional programs in patients with sepsis. These findings provide comprehensive insights into the importance of monocyte heterogeneity during TI in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular metabolism is tightly regulated by growth factor signaling, which promotes metabolic rewiring to support growth and proliferation. While growth factor-induced transcriptional and post-translational modes of metabolic regulation have been well defined, whether post-transcriptional mechanisms impacting mRNA stability regulate this process is less clear. Here, we present the ZFP36/L1/L2 family of RNA-binding proteins and mRNA decay factors as key drivers of metabolic regulation downstream of acute growth factor signaling. We quantitatively catalog metabolic enzyme and nutrient transporter mRNAs directly bound by ZFP36 following growth factor stimulation—many of which encode rate-limiting steps in metabolic pathways. Further, we show that ZFP36 directly promotes the mRNA decay of Enolase 2 (Eno2), altering Eno2 protein expression and enzymatic activity, and provide evidence of a ZFP36/Eno2 axis during VEGF-stimulated developmental retinal angiogenesis. Thus, ZFP36-mediated mRNA decay serves as an important mode of metabolic regulation downstream of growth factor signaling within dynamic cell and tissue states.

Abstract: Summary
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common, highly heritable inflammatory arthritis characterized by enthesitis of the spine and sacroiliac joints. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed more than 100 genetic associations whose functional effects remain largely unresolved. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic map of disease-relevant blood immune cell subsets from AS patients and healthy controls. We find that, while CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells show disease-specific differences at the RNA level, epigenomic differences are only apparent upon multi-omics integration. The latter reveals enrichment at disease-associated loci in monocytes. We link putative functional SNPs to genes using high-resolution Capture-C at 10 loci, including PTGER4 and ETS1, and show how disease-specific functional genomic data can be integrated with GWASs to enhance therapeutic target discovery. This study combines epigenetic and transcriptional analysis with GWASs to identify disease-relevant cell types and gene regulation of likely pathogenic relevance and prioritize drug targets.

Abstract: Background
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an intestinally produced hormone released by the L-cells to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin release. Vine tea, a traditional Chinese medicine made from the delicate stem and leaves of Ampelopsis grossedentata, has been reported to exert antidiabetic effects; however, the role and mechanism of dihydromyricetin, the main active ingredient of vine tea, remain unclear.
Methods and results
MTT assay was applied to detect cell viability. GLP-1 levels in the culture medium using a mouse GLP-1 ELISA kit. The level of GLP-1 in cells was examined using IF staining. NBDG assay was performed to evaluate the glucose uptake by STC-1 cells. The in vivo roles of dihydromyricetin in the diabetes mellitus mouse model were investigated. In this study, 25 μM dihydromyricetin, was found to cause no significant suppression of STC-1 cell viability. Dihydromyricetin markedly elevated GLP-1 secretion and glucose uptake by STC-1 cells. Although metformin increased GLP-1 release and glucose uptake by STC-1 cells more, dihydromyricetin further enhanced the effects of metformin. Moreover, dihydromyricetin or metformin alone significantly promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK, increased GLUT4 levels, inhibited ERK1/2 and IRS-1 phosphorylation, and decreased NF-κB levels, and dihydromyricetin also enhanced the effects of metformin on these factors. The in vivo results further confirmed the antidiabetic function of dihydromyricetin.
Conclusion
Dihydromyricetin promotes GLP-1 release and glucose uptake by STC-1 cells and enhances the effects of metformin upon STC-1 cells and diabetic mice, which might ameliorate diabetes through improving L cell functions. The Erk1/2 and AMPK signaling pathways might be involved.

Abstract: Summary
Response to multiple microenvironmental cues and resilience to mechanical stress are essential features of trafficking leukocytes. Here, we describe unexpected role of titin (TTN), the largest protein encoded by the human genome, in the regulation of mechanisms of lymphocyte trafficking. Human T and B lymphocytes express five TTN isoforms, exhibiting cell-specific expression, distinct localization to plasma membrane microdomains, and different distribution to cytosolic versus nuclear compartments. In T lymphocytes, the LTTN1 isoform governs the morphogenesis of plasma membrane microvilli independently of ERM protein phosphorylation status, thus allowing selectin-mediated capturing and rolling adhesions. Likewise, LTTN1 controls chemokine-triggered integrin activation. Accordingly, LTTN1 mediates rho and rap small GTPases activation, but not actin polymerization. In contrast, chemotaxis is facilitated by LTTN1 degradation. Finally, LTTN1 controls resilience to passive cell deformation and ensures T lymphocyte survival in the blood stream. LTTN1 is, thus, a critical and versatile housekeeping regulator of T lymphocyte trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
The broad research use of organoids from high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) has been hampered by low culture success rates and limited availability of fresh tumor material. Here, we describe a method for generation and long-term expansion of HGSC organoids with efficacy markedly improved over previous reports (53% vs. 23%–38%). We established organoids from cryopreserved material, demonstrating the feasibility of using viably biobanked tissue for HGSC organoid derivation. Genomic, histologic, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that organoids recapitulated genetic and phenotypic features of original tumors. Organoid drug responses correlated with clinical treatment outcomes, although in a culture conditions-dependent manner and only in organoids maintained in human plasma-like medium (HPLM). Organoids from consenting patients are available to the research community through a public biobank and organoid genomic data are explorable through an interactive online tool. Taken together, this resource facilitates the application of HGSC organoids in basic and translational ovarian cancer research.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic structural variation (SV) affects genetic and phenotypic characteristics in diverse organisms, but the lack of reliable methods to detect SV has hindered genetic analysis. We developed a computational algorithm (MOPline) that includes missing call recovery combined with high-confidence SV call selection and genotyping using short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Using 3,672 high-coverage WGS datasets, MOPline stably detected ∼16,000 SVs per individual, which is over ∼1.7–3.3-fold higher than previous large-scale projects while exhibiting a comparable level of statistical quality metrics. We imputed SVs from 181,622 Japanese individuals for 42 diseases and 60 quantitative traits. A genome-wide association study with the imputed SVs revealed 41 top-ranked or nearly top-ranked genome-wide significant SVs, including 8 exonic SVs with 5 novel associations and enriched mobile element insertions. This study demonstrates that short-read WGS data can be used to identify rare and common SVs associated with a variety of traits.

Abstract: Summary
In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, we show that response to radiation therapy (RT) is characterized by increased IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ along with decreased IL-2Rα expression. The bispecific PD1-IL2v is a PD-1-targeted IL-2 variant (IL-2v) immunocytokine with engineered IL-2 cis targeted to PD-1 and abolished IL-2Rα binding, which enhances tumor-antigen-specific T cell activation while reducing regulatory T cell (Treg) suppression. Using PD1-IL2v in orthotopic PDAC KPC-driven tumor models, we show marked improvement in local and metastatic survival, along with a profound increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cell subsets with a transcriptionally and metabolically active phenotype and preferential activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In combination with single-dose RT, PD1-IL2v treatment results in a robust, durable expansion of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells, T cell stemness, tumor-specific memory immune response, natural killer (NK) cell activation, and decreased Tregs. These data show that PD1-IL2v leads to profound local and distant response in PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Neoadjuvant immunotherapies (NITs) have led to clinical benefits in several cancers. Characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to NIT may lead to improved treatment strategies. Here we show that exhausted, tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T (Tex) cells display local and systemic responses to concurrent neoadjuvant TGF-β and PD-L1 blockade. NIT induces a significant and selective increase in circulating Tex cells associated with reduced intratumoral expression of the tissue-retention marker CD103. TGF-β-driven CD103 expression on CD8+ T cells is reversed following TGF-β neutralization in vitro, implicating TGF-β in T cell tissue retention and impaired systemic immunity. Transcriptional changes implicate T cell receptor signaling and glutamine metabolism as important determinants of enhanced or reduced Tex treatment response, respectively. Our analysis illustrates physiological and metabolic changes underlying T cell responses to NIT, highlighting the interplay between immunosuppression, tissue retention, and systemic anti-tumor immunity and suggest antagonism of T cell tissue retention as a promising neoadjuvant treatment strategy.

Role of histone deacetylase 9 in human periodontal ligament stem cells autophagy in a tumour necrosis factor α-induced inflammatory environment,

Abstract: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in the post-translational modification of histones, which can affect the biological properties of cells, thereby altering disease progression and outcomes. However, it remains unclear how HDAC9, a class II HDAC, affects the autophagy of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). We aimed to identify its role in autophagy in hPDLSCs in an inflammatory environment and to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms. A rat periodontitis model was induced by ligating the molars with silk thread. Expression of autophagy-related genes and TNF-α was elevated in this model. TNF-α was used to stimulate hPDLSCs to establish an inflammatory environment. In the TNF-α-stimulated hPDLSCs, the expression of ATG7, ATG12, Beclin-1, LC3 and HDAC9 was upregulated, and that of p62 was downregulated. When HDAC9 expression was inhibited, autophagy-related genes expression was downregulated, and p62 expression was upregulated in TNF-α-treated hPDLSCs, indicating that autophagy was inhibited under these conditions. ERK pathway inhibition significantly reduced HDAC9-mediated autophagy in TNF-α-treated hPDLSCs. These findings reveal that autophagy occurred in our rat periodontitis model and that HDAC9 regulated autophagy via ERK pathways in hPDLSCs in the inflammatory environment. HDAC9 is therefore a potential target for the treatment of periodontitis.

Abstract: Summary
We analyzed 2,532 lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) to identify the clinicopathological and genomic features associated with metastasis, metastatic burden, organotropism, and metastasis-free survival. Patients who develop metastasis are younger and male, with primary tumors enriched in micropapillary or solid histological subtypes and with a higher mutational burden, chromosomal instability, and fraction of genome doublings. Inactivation of TP53, SMARCA4, and CDKN2A are correlated with a site-specific shorter time to metastasis. The APOBEC mutational signature is more prevalent among metastases, particularly liver lesions. Analyses of matched specimens show that oncogenic and actionable alterations are frequently shared between primary tumors and metastases, whereas copy number alterations of unknown significance are more often private to metastases. Only 4% of metastases harbor therapeutically actionable alterations undetected in their matched primaries. Key clinicopathological and genomic alterations in our cohort were externally validated. In summary, our analysis highlights the complexity of clinicopathological features and tumor genomics in LUAD organotropism.

Abstract: Summary
PINK1 is activated by autophosphorylation and forms a high-molecular-weight complex, thereby initiating the selective removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy. Other than translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane complexes, members of PINK1-containing protein complexes remain obscure. By mass spectrometric analysis of PINK1 co-immunoprecipitates, we identify the inner membrane protein TIM23 as a component of the PINK1 complex. TIM23 downregulation decreases PINK1 levels and significantly delays autophosphorylation, indicating that TIM23 promotes PINK1 accumulation in response to depolarization. Moreover, inactivation of the mitochondrial protease OMA1 not only enhances PINK1 accumulation but also represses the reduction in PINK1 levels induced by TIM23 downregulation, suggesting that TIM23 facilitates PINK1 activation by safeguarding against degradation by OMA1. Indeed, deficiencies of pathogenic PINK1 mutants that fail to interact with TIM23 are partially restored by OMA1 inactivation. These findings indicate that TIM23 plays a distinct role in activating mitochondrial autophagy by protecting PINK1.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin organization is crucial for transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Mediator is an essential and conserved co-activator thought to act in concert with chromatin regulators. However, it remains largely unknown how their functions are coordinated. Here, we provide evidence in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that Mediator establishes physical contact with RSC (Remodels the Structure of Chromatin), a conserved and essential chromatin remodeling complex that is crucial for nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) formation. We determine the role of Mediator-RSC interaction in their chromatin binding, nucleosome occupancy, and transcription on a genomic scale. Mediator and RSC co-localize on wide NDRs of promoter regions, and specific Mediator mutations affect nucleosome eviction and TSS-associated +1 nucleosome stability. This work shows that Mediator contributes to RSC remodeling function to shape NDRs and maintain chromatin organization on promoter regions.

Abstract: Summary
Human somatic cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotent stem cells by small molecules through an intermediate stage with a regeneration signature, but how this regeneration state is induced remains largely unknown. Here, through integrated single-cell analysis of transcriptome, we demonstrate that the pathway of human chemical reprogramming with regeneration state is distinct from that of transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming. Time-course construction of chromatin landscapes unveils hierarchical histone modification remodeling underlying the regeneration program, which involved sequential enhancer recommissioning and mirrored the reversal process of regeneration potential lost in organisms as they mature. In addition, LEF1 is identified as a key upstream regulator for regeneration gene program activation. Furthermore, we reveal that regeneration program activation requires sequential enhancer silencing of somatic and proinflammatory programs. Altogether, chemical reprogramming resets the epigenome through reversal of the loss of natural regeneration, representing a distinct concept for cellular reprogramming and advancing the development of regenerative therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental information may be encoded in the temporal dynamics of transcription factor (TF) activation and subsequently decoded by gene promoters to enact stimulus-specific gene expression programs. Previous studies of this behavior focused on the encoding and decoding of information in TF nuclear localization dynamics, yet cells control the activity of TFs in myriad ways, including by regulating their ability to bind DNA. Here, we use light-controlled mutants of the yeast TF Msn2 as a model system to investigate how promoter decoding of TF localization dynamics is affected by changes in the ability of the TF to bind DNA. We find that yeast promoters directly decode the light-controlled localization dynamics of Msn2 and that the effects of changing Msn2 affinity on that decoding behavior are highly promoter dependent, illustrating how cells could regulate TF localization dynamics and DNA binding in concert for improved control of gene expression.

Abstract: Intestinal injury is a common adverse effect of methotrexate (MTX) therapy, limiting its clinical use. Despite oxidative stress and inflammation being the most embedded mechanism of injury, pharmacological agents that exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory impacts could prevent such toxicities. This study aimed to assess the enteroprotective effect of lactobacillus acidophilus (LB) and/or umbelliferone (UMB) against MTX-induced intestinal injury. Histologically, pretreatment with LB, UMB, or their combinations preserve the intestinal histological structure and mucin content with superior effect in combination therapy. In addition, oral pretreatment with UMB, LB, or their combinations significantly restored oxidant/antioxidant status, as evidenced by the upregulation of Nrf2, SOD3, HO-1, GSH, and GST levels concurrent with a decline in MDA contents. Besides, they suppressed the inflammatory burden by inhibiting STAT3, MPO, TLR4, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels. Moreover, LB, UMB, or their combinations significantly upregulated Wnt and β-catenin expression. Notably, pretreatment with the combination therapy is superior to monotherapy in protecting rats' small intestines from MTX-induced enteritis. In conclusion, combined pretreatment with LB and UMB could be a novel therapeutic regimen for conditions of intestinal injury induced by MTX via restoring oxidant/antioxidant balance and suppressing inflammatory burden.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are an attractive model to study the relationship between signaling and cell fates. Cultured mouse ESCs can exist in multiple states resembling distinct stages of early embryogenesis, such as totipotent, pluripotent, primed, and primitive endoderm. The signaling mechanisms regulating the totipotent state and coexistence of these states are poorly understood. Here we identify bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling as an inducer of the totipotent state. However, we discover that BMP’s role is constrained by the cross-activation of FGF, NODAL, and WNT pathways. We exploit this finding to enhance the proportion of totipotent cells by rationally inhibiting the cross-activated pathways. Single-cell mRNA sequencing reveals that induction of the totipotent state is accompanied by suppression of primed and primitive endoderm states. Furthermore, reprogrammed totipotent cells we generate in culture resemble totipotent cells of preimplantation embryo. Our findings reveal a BMP signaling mechanism regulating both the totipotent state and heterogeneity of ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Several methods for generating human-skin-equivalent (HSE) organoid cultures are in use to study skin biology; however, few studies thoroughly characterize these systems. To fill this gap, we use single-cell transcriptomics to compare in vitro HSEs, xenograft HSEs, and in vivo epidermis. By combining differential gene expression, pseudotime analyses, and spatial localization, we reconstruct HSE keratinocyte differentiation trajectories that recapitulate known in vivo epidermal differentiation pathways and show that HSEs contain major in vivo cellular states. However, HSEs also develop unique keratinocyte states, an expanded basal stem cell program, and disrupted terminal differentiation. Cell-cell communication modeling shows aberrant epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated signaling pathways that alter upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) supplementation. Last, xenograft HSEs at early time points post transplantation significantly rescue many in vitro deficits while undergoing a hypoxic response that drives an alternative differentiation lineage. This study highlights the strengths and limitations of organoid cultures and identifies areas for potential innovation.

Abstract: Summary
Persistent pain is a prevalent medical concern correlating with a hyperexcitable anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Its activity is modulated by inputs from several brain regions, but the maladjustments that these afferent circuits undergo during the transition from acute to chronic pain still require clarification. We focus on ACC-projecting claustrum (CLAACC) neurons and their responses to sensory and aversive stimuli in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Using chemogenetics, in vivo calcium imaging, and ex vivo electrophysiological approaches, we reveal that suppression of CLAACC activity acutely attenuates allodynia and that the claustrum preferentially transmits aversive information to the ACC. With prolonged pain, a claustro-cingulate functional impairment develops, which is mediated by a weakened excitatory drive onto ACC pyramidal neurons, resulting in a diminished claustral influence on the ACC. These findings support an instrumental role of the claustrum in the processing of nociceptive information and its susceptibility to persistent pain states.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, caused by poorly known pathogenic mechanisms and aggravated by delayed therapeutic intervention, that still lacks an effective cure. However, it is clear that some important neurophysiological processes are altered years before the onset of clinical symptoms, offering the possibility of identifying biological targets useful for implementation of new therapies. Of note, evidence has been provided suggesting that mitochondria, pivotal organelles in sustaining neuronal energy demand and modulating synaptic activity, are dysfunctional in AD samples. In particular, alterations in mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling have been proposed as causal events for neurodegeneration, although the exact outcomes and molecular mechanisms of these defects, as well as their longitudinal progression, are not always clear. Here, we discuss the importance of a correct mitochondrial Ca2+ handling for neuronal physiology and summarize the latest findings on dysfunctional mitochondrial Ca2+ pathways in AD, analysing possible consequences contributing to the neurodegeneration that characterizes the disease.

Abstract: Summary
VLCFAs (very-long-chain fatty acids) are the most abundant fatty acids in myelin. Hence, during demyelination or aging, glia are exposed to higher levels of VLCFA than normal. We report that glia convert these VLCFA into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) via a glial-specific S1P pathway. Excess S1P causes neuroinflammation, NF-κB activation, and macrophage infiltration into the CNS. Suppressing the function of S1P in fly glia or neurons, or administration of Fingolimod, an S1P receptor antagonist, strongly attenuates the phenotypes caused by excess VLCFAs. In contrast, elevating the VLCFA levels in glia and immune cells exacerbates these phenotypes. Elevated VLCFA and S1P are also toxic in vertebrates based on a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Indeed, reducing VLCFA with bezafibrate ameliorates the phenotypes. Moreover, simultaneous use of bezafibrate and fingolimod synergizes to improve EAE, suggesting that lowering VLCFA and S1P is a treatment avenue for MS.

Abstract: Summary
Small ribonucleoproteins (sRNPs) target nascent precursor RNAs to guide folding, modification, and splicing during transcription. Yet, rapid co-transcriptional folding of the RNA can mask sRNP sites, impeding target recognition and regulation. To examine how sRNPs target nascent RNAs, we monitored binding of bacterial Hfq⋅DsrA sRNPs to rpoS transcripts using single-molecule co-localization co-transcriptional assembly (smCoCoA). We show that Hfq⋅DsrA recursively samples the mRNA before transcription of the target site to poise it for base pairing with DsrA. We adapted smCoCoA to precisely measure when the target site is synthesized and revealed that Hfq⋅DsrA often binds the mRNA during target site synthesis close to RNA polymerase (RNAP). We suggest that targeting transcripts near RNAP allows an sRNP to capture a site before the transcript folds, providing a kinetic advantage over post-transcriptional targeting. We propose that other sRNPs may also use RNAP-proximal targeting to hasten recognition and regulation.

Abstract: Summary
We uncover a tumor-suppressive process in urothelium called transcriptional-translational conflict caused by deregulation of the central chromatin remodeling component ARID1A. Loss of Arid1a triggers an increase in a nexus of pro-proliferation transcripts, but a simultaneous inhibition of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which results in tumor suppression. Resolution of this conflict through enhancing translation elongation speed enables the efficient and precise synthesis of a network of poised mRNAs resulting in uncontrolled proliferation, clonogenic growth, and bladder cancer progression. We observe a similar phenomenon in patients with ARID1A-low tumors, which also exhibit increased translation elongation activity through eEF2. These findings have important clinical implications because ARID1A-deficient, but not ARID1A-proficient, tumors are sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of protein synthesis. These discoveries reveal an oncogenic stress created by transcriptional-translational conflict and provide a unified gene expression model that unveils the importance of the crosstalk between transcription and translation in promoting cancer.

Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is a complex disease influenced by multiple genetic and epigenetic factors. Chronic inflammation caused by Helicobacter pylori infection and dietary risk factors can result in the accumulation of aberrant DNA methylation in gastric mucosa, which promotes GC development. Tensin 4 (TNS4), a member of the Tensin family of proteins, is localized to focal adhesion sites, which connect the extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal network. We identified upregulation of TNS4 in GC using quantitative reverse transcription PCR with 174 paired samples of GC tumors and adjacent normal tissues. Transcriptional activation of TNS4 occurred even during the early stage of tumor development. TNS4 depletion in GC cell lines that expressed high to moderate levels of TNS4, i.e., SNU-601, KATO III, and MKN74, reduced cell proliferation and migration, whereas ectopic expression of TNS4 in those lines that expressed lower levels of TNS4, i.e., SNU-638, MKN1, and MKN45 increased colony formation and cell migration. The promoter region of TNS4 was hypomethylated in GC cell lines that showed upregulation of TNS4. We also found a significant negative correlation between TNS4 expression and CpG methylation in 250 GC tumors based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. This study elucidates the epigenetic mechanism of TNS4 activation and functional roles of TNS4 in GC development and progression and suggests a possible approach for future GC treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional pauses mediate regulation of RNA biogenesis. DNA-encoded pause signals trigger pausing by stabilizing RNA polymerase (RNAP) swiveling and inhibiting DNA translocation. The N-terminal domain (NGN) of the only universal transcription factor, NusG/Spt5, modulates pausing through contacts to RNAP and DNA. Pro-pausing NusGs enhance pauses, whereas anti-pausing NusGs suppress pauses. Little is known about pausing and NusG in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We report that MtbNusG is pro-pausing. MtbNusG captures paused, swiveled RNAP by contacts to the RNAP protrusion and nontemplate-DNA wedged between the NGN and RNAP gate loop. In contrast, anti-pausing Escherichia coli (Eco) NGN contacts the MtbRNAP gate loop, inhibiting swiveling and pausing. Using CRISPR-mediated genetics, we show that pro-pausing NGN is required for mycobacterial fitness. Our results define an essential function of mycobacterial NusG and the structural basis of pro- versus anti-pausing NusG activity, with broad implications for the function of all NusG orthologs.

Abstract: Summary
Activation and degranulation of mast cells (MCs) is an essential aspect of innate and adaptive immunity. Skin MCs, the most exposed to the external environment, are at risk of quickly degranulating with potentially severe consequences. Here, we define how MCs assume a tolerant phenotype via crosstalk with dermal fibroblasts (dFBs) and how this phenotype reduces unnecessary inflammation when in contact with beneficial commensal bacteria. We explore the interaction of human MCs (HMCs) and dFBs in the human skin microenvironment and test how this interaction controls MC inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. We show that the extracellular matrix hyaluronic acid, as the activator of the regulatory zinc finger (de)ubiquitinating enzyme A20/tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), is responsible for the reduced HMC response to commensal bacteria. The role of hyaluronic acid as an anti-inflammatory ligand on MCs opens new avenues for the potential treatment of inflammatory and allergic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-to-cell heterogeneity is vital for tumor evolution and survival. How cancer cells achieve and exploit this heterogeneity remains an active area of research. Here, we identify c-Myc as a highly heterogeneously expressed transcription factor and an orchestrator of transcriptional and phenotypic diversity in cancer cells. By monitoring endogenous c-Myc protein in individual living cells, we report the surprising pulsatile nature of c-Myc expression and the extensive cell-to-cell variability in its dynamics. We further show that heterogeneity in c-Myc dynamics leads to variable target gene transcription and that timing of c-Myc expression predicts cell-cycle progression rates and drug sensitivities. Together, our data advocate for a model in which cancer cells increase the heterogeneity of functionally diverse transcription factors such as c-Myc to rapidly survey transcriptional landscapes and survive stress.

Abstract: Summary
Gain-of-function mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause Parkinson’s disease (PD), increasing phosphorylation of RAB GTPases through hyperactive kinase activity. We find that LRRK2-hyperphosphorylated RABs disrupt the axonal transport of autophagosomes by perturbing the coordinated regulation of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin. In iPSC-derived human neurons, knockin of the strongly hyperactive LRRK2-p.R1441H mutation causes striking impairments in autophagosome transport, inducing frequent directional reversals and pauses. Knockout of the opposing protein phosphatase 1H (PPM1H) phenocopies the effect of hyperactive LRRK2. Overexpression of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a GTPase that acts as a switch for selective activation of dynein or kinesin, attenuates transport defects in both p.R1441H knockin and PPM1H knockout neurons. Together, these findings support a model where a regulatory imbalance between LRRK2-hyperphosphorylated RABs and ARF6 induces an unproductive “tug-of-war” between dynein and kinesin, disrupting processive autophagosome transport. This disruption may contribute to PD pathogenesis by impairing the essential homeostatic functions of axonal autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
In tissue development and homeostasis, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling is finely coordinated by latent forms and matrix sequestration. Optogenetics can offer precise and dynamic control of cell signaling. We report the development of an optogenetic human induced pluripotent stem cell system for TGF-β signaling and demonstrate its utility in directing differentiation into the smooth muscle, tenogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Light-activated TGF-β signaling resulted in expression of differentiation markers at levels close to those in soluble factor-treated cultures, with minimal phototoxicity. In a cartilage-bone model, light-patterned TGF-β gradients allowed the establishment of hyaline-like layer of cartilage tissue at the articular surface while attenuating with depth to enable hypertrophic induction at the osteochondral interface. By selectively activating TGF-β signaling in co-cultures of light-responsive and non-responsive cells, undifferentiated and differentiated cells were simultaneously maintained in a single culture with shared medium. This platform can enable patient-specific and spatiotemporally precise studies of cellular decision making.

Abstract: Summary
During inflammation, the skin deploys antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) yet during allergic inflammation it becomes more susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus. To understand this contradiction, single-cell sequencing of Il4ra−/− mice combined with skin microbiome analysis reveals that lower production of AMPs from interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) activation selectively inhibits survival of antibiotic-producing strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS). Diminished AMPs under conditions of T helper type 2 (Th2) inflammation enable expansion of CoNS strains without antibiotic activity and increase Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), recapitulating the microbiome on humans with atopic dermatitis. This response is rescued in Camp−/− mice or after topical steroids, since further inhibition of AMPs enables survival of antibiotic-producing CoNS strains. In conditions of Th17 inflammation, a higher expression of host AMPs is sufficient to directly inhibit S. aureus survival. These results show that antimicrobials produced by the host and commensal bacteria each act to control S. aureus on the skin.

Although past studies have focused on an individual molecule or cell type, the organism-wide secretome response to physical activity has not been evaluated. Here, we use a cell-type-specific proteomic approach to generate a 21-cell-type, 10-tissue map of exercise training-regulated secretomes in mice. Our dataset identifies >200 exercise training-regulated cell-type-secreted protein pairs, the majority of which have not been previously reported. Pdgfra-cre-labeled secretomes were the most responsive to exercise training. Finally, we show anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, and exercise performance-enhancing activities for proteoforms of intracellular carboxylesterases whose secretion from the liver is induced by exercise training.

Abstract: Summary
Defining the mechanisms that govern heart development is essential for identifying the etiology of congenital heart disease. Here, quantitative proteomics was used to measure temporal changes in the proteome at critical stages of murine embryonic heart development. Global temporal profiles of the over 7,300 proteins uncovered signature cardiac protein interaction networks that linked protein dynamics with molecular pathways. Using this integrated dataset, we identified and demonstrated a functional role for the mevalonate pathway in regulating the cell cycle of embryonic cardiomyocytes. Overall, our proteomic datasets are a resource for studying events that regulate embryonic heart development and contribute to congenital heart disease.

Abstract: Summary
Apatinib has been shown to clinically enhance anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, the complexity of GC immunosuppression remains a challenge for precision immunotherapy. Here, we profile the transcriptomes of 34,182 single cells from GC patient-derived xenografts of humanized mouse models treated with vehicle, nivolumab, or nivolumab plus apatinib. Notably, excessive expression of CXCL5 in the CellCycle malignant epithelium, induced by anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and blocked by combined apatinib treatment, is found to be a key driver of tumor-associated neutrophil (TAN) recruitment in the tumor microenvironment through the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis. We further show that the protumor TAN signature is associated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy-related progressive disease and poor cancer prognosis. Molecular and functional analyses in cell-derived xenograft models confirm the positive in vivo therapeutic effect of targeting the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Altogether, our study elucidates the GC immunosuppressive landscape in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and highlights potential targets for overcoming checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis and stimulates glucose conversion to glycogen and lipids. How these activities are coordinated to prevent hypoglycemia and hepatosteatosis is unclear. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is rate controlling for gluconeogenesis. However, inborn human FBP1 deficiency does not cause hypoglycemia unless accompanied by fasting or starvation, which also trigger paradoxical hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia. Hepatocyte FBP1-ablated mice exhibit identical fasting-conditional pathologies along with AKT hyperactivation, whose inhibition reversed hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia but not hypoglycemia. Surprisingly, fasting-mediated AKT hyperactivation is insulin dependent. Independently of its catalytic activity, FBP1 prevents insulin hyperresponsiveness by forming a stable complex with AKT, PP2A-C, and aldolase B (ALDOB), which specifically accelerates AKT dephosphorylation. Enhanced by fasting and weakened by elevated insulin, FBP1:PP2A-C:ALDOB:AKT complex formation, which is disrupted by human FBP1 deficiency mutations or a C-terminal FBP1 truncation, prevents insulin-triggered liver pathologies and maintains lipid and glucose homeostasis. Conversely, an FBP1-derived complex disrupting peptide reverses diet-induced insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
DNA binding domains (DBDs) of transcription factors (TFs) recognize DNA sequence motifs that are highly abundant in genomes. Within cells, TFs bind a subset of motif-containing sites as directed by either their DBDs or DBD-external (nonDBD) sequences. To define the relative roles of DBDs and nonDBDs in directing binding preferences, we compared the genome-wide binding of 48 (∼30%) budding yeast TFs with their DBD-only, nonDBD-truncated, and nonDBD-only mutants. With a few exceptions, binding locations differed between DBDs and TFs, resulting from the cumulative action of multiple determinants mapped mostly to disordered nonDBD regions. Furthermore, TFs’ preferences for promoters of the fuzzy nucleosome architecture were lost in DBD-only mutants, whose binding spread across promoters, implicating nonDBDs’ preferences in this hallmark of budding yeast regulatory design. We conclude that DBDs and nonDBDs employ complementary DNA-targeting strategies, whose balance defines TF binding specificity along genomes.

Abstract: The most important factors in the non-optimal healing of diabetic wounds are the lack of a suitable scaffold in the wound site for the migration and replacement of cells, as well as the lack of blood supply and effective growth factors in the wound site. Herein we investigated whether a bioengineered micro-porous three-dimensional decellularized amniotic membrane-scaffold (DAMS) in combination with adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) could promote healing in ischemic wounds in diabetic type 1 rat. The diabetic animals were randomly divided into non-treated (untreated group), engraftment by DAMS (DAMS group), transplanted by ASCs (ASC group), and DAMS in combination with ASCs (DAMS+ASC group). Stereological, immunohistochemical, molecular, and tensiometrical assessments were performed on post-surgical days 7, 14, and 21. We found that the rate of wound closure, the volumes of new epidermis and dermis, the numerical density of fibroblasts and blood vessels, the numbers of proliferating cells and collagen deposition as well as biomechanical properties of the healed wounds were significantly higher in the treatment groups in comparison to the untreated group, and were the highest in DAMS+ASC ones. The transcripts for TGF-β and VEGF genes were significantly upregulated in all treatment regimens compared to the untreated group and were the highest for DAMS+ASC group. This is while expression of TNF-α and IL-1β as well as cell density of neutrophils decreased more significantly in DAMS+ASC group as compared with other groups. Overall, it was found that using both DAMS engraftment and ASC transplantation has more impact on diabetic wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebellum is essential for motor control and cognitive functioning, engaging in bidirectional communication with the cerebral cortex. The common marmoset, a small non-human primate, offers unique advantages for studying cerebello-cerebral circuits. However, the marmoset cerebellum is not well described in published resources. In this study, we present a comprehensive atlas of the marmoset cerebellum comprising (1) fine-detailed anatomical atlases and surface-analysis tools of the cerebellar cortex based on ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI, (2) functional connectivity and gradient patterns of the cerebellar cortex revealed by awake resting-state fMRI, and (3) structural-connectivity mapping of cerebellar nuclei using high-resolution diffusion MRI tractography. The atlas elucidates the anatomical details of the marmoset cerebellum, reveals distinct gradient patterns of intra-cerebellar and cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity, and maps the topological relationship of cerebellar nuclei in cerebello-cerebral circuits. As version 5 of the Marmoset Brain Mapping project, this atlas is publicly available at https://marmosetbrainmapping.org/MBMv5.html.

Abstract: The nucleoskeletal protein lamin is primarily responsible for the mechanical stability of the nucleus. The lamin assembly process requires the A11, A22, and ACN binding modes of the coiled-coil dimers. Although X-ray crystallography and chemical cross-linking analysis of lamin A/C have provided snapshots of A11 and ACN binding modes, the assembly mechanism of the entire filament remains to be explained. Here, we report a crystal structure of a coil 2 fragment, revealing the A22 interaction at the atomic resolution. The structure showed detailed structural features, indicating that two coiled-coil dimers of the coil 2 subdomain are separated and then re-organized into the antiparallel-four-helix bundle. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the ACN binding mode between coil 1a and the C-terminal part of coil 2 when the A11 tetramers are arranged by the A22 interactions. We propose a full assembly model of lamin A/C with the curvature around the linkers, reconciling the discrepancy between the in situ and in vitro observations. Our model accounts for the balanced elasticity and stiffness of the nuclear envelopes, which is essential in protecting the cellular nucleus from external pressure.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic activation of inflammatory pathways and suppressed interferon are hallmarks of immunosuppressive tumors. Previous studies have shown that CD11b integrin agonists could enhance anti-tumor immunity through myeloid reprograming, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein we find that CD11b agonists alter tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotypes by repressing NF-κB signaling and activating interferon gene expression simultaneously. Repression of NF-κB signaling involves degradation of p65 protein and is context independent. In contrast, CD11b agonism induces STING/STAT1 pathway-mediated interferon gene expression through FAK-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, with the magnitude of induction dependent on the tumor microenvironment and amplified by cytotoxic therapies. Using tissues from phase I clinical studies, we demonstrate that GB1275 treatment activates STING and STAT1 signaling in TAMs in human tumors. These findings suggest potential mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for CD11b agonists and identify patient populations more likely to benefit.

Abstract: Summary
Combinatorial regulation of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs) may in part arise from kinetic synergy—wherein TFs regulate different steps in the transcription cycle. Kinetic synergy requires that TFs play distinguishable kinetic roles. Here, we used live imaging to determine the kinetic roles of three TFs that activate transcription in the Drosophila embryo—Zelda, Bicoid, and Stat92E—by introducing their binding sites into the even-skipped stripe 2 enhancer. These TFs influence different sets of kinetic parameters, and their influence can change over time. All three TFs increased the fraction of transcriptionally active nuclei; Zelda also shortened the first-passage time into transcription and regulated the interval between transcription events. Stat92E also increased the lifetimes of active transcription. Different TFs can therefore play distinct kinetic roles in activating the transcription. This has consequences for understanding the composition and flexibility of regulatory DNA sequences and the biochemical function of TFs. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is the major cause of cancer death, and the development of therapy resistance is common. The tumor microenvironment can confer chemotherapy resistance (chemoresistance), but little is known about how specific host cells influence therapy outcome. We show that chemotherapy induces neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, which reduces therapy response in mouse models of breast cancer lung metastasis. We reveal that chemotherapy-treated cancer cells secrete IL-1β, which in turn triggers NET formation. Two NET-associated proteins are required to induce chemoresistance: integrin-αvβ1, which traps latent TGF-β, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, which cleaves and activates the trapped latent TGF-β. TGF-β activation causes cancer cells to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and correlates with chemoresistance. Our work demonstrates that NETs regulate the activities of neighboring cells by trapping and activating cytokines and suggests that chemoresistance in the metastatic setting can be reduced or prevented by targeting the IL-1β-NET-TGF-β axis.

Abstract: Summary
The PSMC3IP-MND1 heterodimer promotes meiotic D loop formation before DNA strand exchange. In genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis and interference screens in mitotic cells, depletion of PSMC3IP or MND1 causes sensitivity to poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) used in cancer treatment. PSMC3IP or MND1 depletion also causes ionizing radiation sensitivity. These effects are independent of PSMC3IP/MND1’s role in mitotic alternative lengthening of telomeres. PSMC3IP- or MND1-depleted cells accumulate toxic RAD51 foci in response to DNA damage, show impaired homology-directed DNA repair, and become PARPi sensitive, even in cells lacking both BRCA1 and TP53BP1. Epistasis between PSMC3IP-MND1 and BRCA1/BRCA2 defects suggest that abrogated D loop formation is the cause of PARPi sensitivity. Wild-type PSMC3IP reverses PARPi sensitivity, whereas a PSMC3IP p.Glu201del mutant associated with D loop defects and ovarian dysgenesis does not. These observations suggest that meiotic proteins such as MND1 and PSMC3IP have a greater role in mitotic DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Three classes of yeast protein-coding genes are distinguished by their dependence on the transcription cofactors TFIID, SAGA, and Mediator (MED) Tail, but whether this dependence is determined by the core promoter, upstream activating sequences (UASs), or other gene features is unclear. Also unclear is whether UASs can broadly activate transcription from the different promoter classes. Here, we measure transcription and cofactor specificity for thousands of UAS-core promoter combinations and find that most UASs broadly activate promoters regardless of regulatory class, while few display strong promoter specificity. However, matching UASs and promoters from the same gene class is generally important for optimal expression. We find that sensitivity to rapid depletion of MED Tail or SAGA is dependent on the identity of both UAS and core promoter, while dependence on TFIID localizes to only the promoter. Finally, our results suggest the role of TATA and TATA-like promoter sequences in MED Tail function.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have shown that Lactobacillus species play a role in ameliorating colorectal cancer (CRC) in a mouse model. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we found that administration of a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus plantarum L168 and its metabolite, indole-3-lactic acid, ameliorated intestinal inflammation, tumor growth, and gut dysbiosis. Mechanistically, we indicated that indole-3-lactic acid accelerated IL12a production in dendritic cells by enhancing H3K27ac binding at the enhancer regions of IL12a that contributed to priming CD8+ T cell immunity against tumor growth. Furthermore, indole-3-lactic acid was found to transcriptionally inhibit Saa3 expression related to cholesterol metabolism of CD8+ T cells through changing chromatin accessibility and subsequent enhancing function of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Together, our findings provide new insights into the epigenetic regulation of probiotics-mediated anti-tumor immunity and suggest the potential of L. plantarum L168 and indole-3-lactic acid to develop therapeutic strategies for patients with CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are among the most frequently isolated bacterial species from polymicrobial infections of patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic wounds. We apply mass spectrometry guided interaction studies to determine how chemical interaction shapes the fitness and community structure during co-infection of these two pathogens. We demonstrate that S. aureus is equipped with an elegant mechanism to inactivate pyochelin via the yet uncharacterized methyltransferase Spm (staphylococcal pyochelin methyltransferase). Methylation of pyochelin abolishes the siderophore activity of pyochelin and significantly lowers pyochelin-mediated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in S. aureus. In a murine wound co-infection model, an S. aureus mutant unable to methylate pyochelin shows significantly lower fitness compared with its parental strain. Thus, Spm-mediated pyochelin methylation is a mechanism to increase S. aureus survival during in vivo competition with P. aeruginosa.

Abstract: Summary
Studying thousands of families, we find siblings concordant for autism share more of their parental genomes than expected by chance, and discordant siblings share less, consistent with a role of transmission in autism incidence. The excess sharing of the father is highly significant (p value of 0.0014), with less significance for the mother (p value of 0.31). To compare parental sharing, we adjust for differences in meiotic recombination to obtain a p value of 0.15 that they are shared equally. These observations are contrary to certain models in which the mother carries a greater load than the father. Nevertheless, we present models in which greater sharing of the father is observed even though the mother carries a greater load. More generally, our observations of sharing establish quantitative constraints that any complete genetic model of autism must satisfy, and our methods may be applicable to other complex disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The bioenergetic mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis survives hypoxia are poorly understood. Current models assume that the bacterium shifts to an alternate electron acceptor or fermentation to maintain membrane potential and ATP synthesis. Counterintuitively, we find here that oxygen itself is the principal terminal electron acceptor during hypoxic dormancy. M. tuberculosis can metabolize oxygen efficiently at least two orders of magnitude below the concentration predicted to occur in hypoxic lung granulomas. Despite a difference in apparent affinity for oxygen, both the cytochrome bcc:aa3 and cytochrome bd oxidase respiratory branches are required for hypoxic respiration. Simultaneous inhibition of both oxidases blocks oxygen consumption, reduces ATP levels, and kills M. tuberculosis under hypoxia. The capacity of mycobacteria to scavenge trace levels of oxygen, coupled with the absence of complex regulatory mechanisms to achieve hierarchal control of the terminal oxidases, may be a key determinant of long-term M. tuberculosis survival in hypoxic lung granulomas.

Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of complex neurodevelopmental conditions affecting communication and social interaction in 2.3% of children. Studies that demonstrated its complex genetic architecture have been mainly performed in populations of European ancestry. We investigate the genetics of ASD in an East African cohort (129 individuals) from a population with higher prevalence (5%). Whole-genome sequencing identified 2.13 million private variants in the cohort and potentially pathogenic variants in known ASD genes (including CACNA1C, CHD7, FMR1, and TCF7L2). Admixture analysis demonstrated that the cohort comprises two ancestral populations, African and Eurasian. Admixture mapping discovered 10 regions that confer ASD risk on the African haplotypes, containing several known ASD genes. The increased ASD prevalence in this population suggests decreased heterogeneity in the underlying genetic etiology, enabling risk allele identification.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic alterations are a key hallmark of aging but have been limitedly explored in tissues. Here, using naturally aged murine liver as a model and extending to other quiescent tissues, we find that aging is driven by temporal chromatin alterations that promote a refractory cellular state and compromise cellular identity. Using an integrated multi-omics approach and the first direct visualization of aged chromatin, we find that globally, old cells show H3K27me3-driven broad heterochromatinization and transcriptional suppression. At the local level, site-specific loss of H3K27me3 over promoters of genes encoding developmental transcription factors leads to expression of otherwise non-hepatocyte markers. Interestingly, liver regeneration reverses H3K27me3 patterns and rejuvenates multiple molecular and physiological aspects of the aged liver.

Abstract: Embelin is a natural benzoquinone compound that displays a beneficial effect in various inflammatory-related diseases. However, the effect of embelin on degeneration of intervertebral disc (IDD), a chronic inflammatory disorder, has not been reported. This study was attempted to explore the therapeutic action of embelin on IDD in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis was performed for evaluating the link between embelin and IDD. The human nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) were stimulated with IL-1β to induce inflammation. Cell viability of NPCs was assessed by CCK-8 assay. Western blotting was conducted to detect the expression levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, p65 and p-p65. Apoptotic deaths of NPCs were examined by TUNEL assay. The production of COX-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α was examined by ELISA. It can be seen that 16 overlapping genes were selected from 109 possible targets of embelin and 342 possible targets of IDD. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was a close link between embelin and IDD. We found that embelin dose-dependently improved the cell viability in IL-1β-stimulated NPCs. Embelin elevated the relative levels of p-PI3K/PI3K and p-Akt/Akt in IL-1β-stimulated NPCs. IL-1β induced a significant increase in apoptotic deaths of NPCs, which was attenuated by embelin treatment. IL-1β-induced alternations in expression levels of apoptotic-related proteins including cleaved caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 were prevented by embelin treatment. Pretreatment with LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K) reversed the inhibitory effect of embelin on IL-1β-induced apoptosis in NPCs. Embelin treatment caused inhibitory effects on the IL-1β-stimulated production of COX-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, which were abolished by LY294002 treatment. Furthermore, embelin treatment prevented IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of p65 in NPCs, while LY294002 elevated the embelin-caused decrease in p-p65/p65 level. Overall, embelin protected human NPCs against IL-1β-stimulated apoptosis and inflammation by regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings provided new ideas for the clinical usage of embelin in the prevention and treatment of IDD.

Abstract: The present study examined cellular components and the localization of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) 1 and 2 and serotonin (5-HT) in chemosensory cell clusters in the rat pharynx and larynx. Triple immunolabeling for guanine nucleotide-binding protein G (t), subunit ⍺3 (GNAT3) and nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2) with synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) revealed NTPDase2-immunoreactive type I-like cells in addition to GNAT3-immunoreactive type II-like and Syt1-immunoreactive type III-like cells in pharyngolaryngeal chemosensory cell clusters. Therefore, these clusters appear to comprise similar cell types to those in the lingual taste buds with slight morphological modifications. An immunofluorescence analysis of VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 and GNAT3 with P2X3 purinoceptors revealed that VGLUTs co-localized to P2X3‐immunoreactive spherical nerve terminals closely associated with GNAT3-immunoreactive type II-like cells. Moreover, triple immunolabeling for Syt1/synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kDa (SNAP25) and P2X3 with VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 revealed punctate immunoreactive products for VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 within P2X3‐immunoreactive flat axon terminals wrapped around Syt1/SNAP25-immunoreactive type III-like cells. The afferent nerve fibers innervating cell clusters may contain glutamate and release it by exocytosis. On the other hand, immunoreactive products for 5-HT and dopa decarboxylase were detected in Syt1-immunoreactive cells, indicating the release of 5-HT by these cells. The present results suggest that chemosensory cell clusters in the pharynx and larynx may be modulated by intrinsic glutamate and 5-HT.

Abstract: Summary
The prevailing view of metazoan gene regulation is that transcription is facilitated through the formation of static activator complexes at distal regulatory regions. Here, we employed quantitative single-cell live-imaging and computational analysis to provide evidence that the dynamic assembly and disassembly process of transcription factor (TF) clusters at enhancers is a major source of transcriptional bursting in developing Drosophila embryos. We further show that the regulatory connectivity between TF clustering and burst induction is highly regulated through intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Addition of a poly-glutamine tract to the maternal morphogen Bicoid demonstrated that extended IDR length leads to ectopic TF clustering and burst induction from its endogenous target genes, resulting in defects in body segmentation during embryogenesis. Moreover, we successfully visualized the presence of “shared” TF clusters during the co-activation of two distant genes, which provides a concrete molecular explanation for the newly proposed “topological operon” hypothesis in metazoan gene regulation.

Abstract: The neocortex is the site of higher cognitive functions and its development is tightly regulated by cell signalling pathways. Wnt signalling is inexorably linked with neocortex development but its precise role remains unclear. Most studies demonstrate that Wnt/β-catenin regulates neural progenitor self-renewal but others suggest it can also promote differentiation. Wnt/STOP signalling is a novel branch of the Wnt pathway that stabilizes proteins during G2/M by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-mediated protein degradation. Recent data from our work in Da Silva et al. (2021) demonstrate that Wnt/STOP is involved in neocortex development where, by stabilizing the neurogenic transcription factors Sox4 and Sox11, it promotes neural progenitor differentiation. We also show that Wnt/STOP regulates asymmetric cell division and cell cycle dynamics in apical and basal progenitors, respectively. Our study reveals a division of labour in the Wnt signalling pathway by suggesting that Wnt/STOP is the primary driver of cortical neurogenesis while Wnt/β-catenin is mainly responsible for self-renewal. These results resolve a decades-old question on the role of Wnt signalling in cortical neural progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Metaphocytes are tissue-resident macrophage (TRM)/dendritic cell (DC)-like cells of non-hematopoietic origin in zebrafish barrier tissues. One remarkable property of metaphocytes is their ability to capture soluble antigens from the external environment via transepithelial protrusions, a unique function manifested by specialized subpopulations of the TRMs/DCs in mammal barrier tissues. Yet, how metaphocytes acquire myeloid-like cell properties from non-hematopoietic precursors and how they regulate barrier immunity remains unknown. Here, we show that metaphocytes are in situ generated from local progenitors guided by the ETS transcription factor Spic, the deficiency of which results in the absence of metaphocytes. We further document that metaphocytes are the major IL-22BP-producing cells, and the depletion of metaphocytes causes dysregulated barrier immunity that resembles the phenotype of IL-22BP-deficient mice. These findings reveal the ontogeny, development, and function of metaphocytes in zebrafish, which facilitates our understanding of the nature and function of the mammalian TRM/DC counterparts.

Abstract: Summary
The input-output transformation of individual neurons is a key building block of neural circuit dynamics. While previous models of this transformation vary widely in their complexity, they all describe the underlying functional architecture as unitary, such that each synaptic input makes a single contribution to the neuronal response. Here, we show that the input-output transformation of CA1 pyramidal cells is instead best captured by two distinct functional architectures operating in parallel. We used statistically principled methods to fit flexible, yet interpretable, models of the transformation of input spikes into the somatic “output” voltage and to automatically select among alternative functional architectures. With dendritic Na+ channels blocked, responses are accurately captured by a single static and global nonlinearity. In contrast, dendritic Na+-dependent integration requires a functional architecture with multiple dynamic nonlinearities and clustered connectivity. These two architectures incorporate distinct morphological and biophysical properties of the neuron and its synaptic organization.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal place cells exhibit spatially modulated firing, or place fields, which can remap to encode changes in the environment or other variables. Unique among hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) has two excitatory populations of place cells, granule cells and mossy cells, which are among the least and most active spatially modulated cells in the hippocampus, respectively. Previous studies of remapping in the DG have drawn different conclusions about whether granule cells exhibit global remapping and contribute to the encoding of context specificity. By recording granule cells and mossy cells as mice foraged in different environments, we found that by most measures, both granule cells and mossy cells remapped robustly but through different mechanisms that are consistent with firing properties of each cell type. Our results resolve the ambiguity surrounding remapping in the DG and suggest that most spatially modulated granule cells contribute to orthogonal representations of distinct spatial contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Vitamin K is a micronutrient necessary for γ-carboxylation of glutamic acids. This post-translational modification occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and affects secreted proteins. Recent clinical studies implicate vitamin K in the pathophysiology of diabetes, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse β cells lacking γ-carboxylation fail to adapt their insulin secretion in the context of age-related insulin resistance or diet-induced β cell stress. In human islets, γ-carboxylase expression positively correlates with improved insulin secretion in response to glucose. We identify endoplasmic reticulum Gla protein (ERGP) as a γ-carboxylated ER-resident Ca2+-binding protein expressed in β cells. Mechanistically, γ-carboxylation of ERGP protects cells against Ca2+ overfilling by diminishing STIM1 and Orai1 interaction and restraining store-operated Ca2+ entry. These results reveal a critical role of vitamin K-dependent carboxylation in regulation of Ca2+ flux in β cells and in their capacity to adapt to metabolic stress.

Abstract: Summary
There are vast gaps in our understanding of the organization and operation of the human nervous system at the level of individual neurons and their networks. Here, we report reliable and robust acute multichannel recordings using planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) implanted intracortically in awake brain surgery with open craniotomies that grant access to large parts of the cortical hemisphere. We obtained high-quality extracellular neuronal activity at the microcircuit, local field potential level and at the cellular, single-unit level. Recording from the parietal association cortex, a region rarely explored in human single-unit studies, we demonstrate applications on these complementary spatial scales and describe traveling waves of oscillatory activity as well as single-neuron and neuronal population responses during numerical cognition, including operations with uniquely human number symbols. Intraoperative MEA recordings are practicable and can be scaled up to explore cellular and microcircuit mechanisms of a wide range of human brain functions.

Abstract: CXCR3 regulates leukocyte trafficking, maturation, and various pathophysiological conditions. Alternative splicing generates three CXCR3 isoforms in humans. Previous studies investigated the roles of CXCR3 isoforms, and some biochemical data are not correlated with biological relevance analyses. RT-PCR analyses indicate that most cells express all three splicing variants, suggesting that they may mutually affect the chemokine binding and cellular responses of other splicing variants. Here, we performed an integrative analysis of the functional relations among CXCR3 splicing variants and their chemokine-dependent signaling using NanoBiT live cell protein interaction assays. The results indicated that the CXCR3 N-terminal region affected cell surface expression levels and ligand-dependent activation. CXCR3A was efficiently expressed in the plasma membrane and responded to I-TAC, IP-10, and MIG chemokines. By contrast, CXCR3B had low plasma membrane expression and mediated I-TAC–stimulated cellular responses. CXCR3Alt was rarely expressed on the cell surface and did not mediate any cell responses to the tested chemokines; however, CXCR3Alt negatively affected the plasma membrane expression of CXCR3A and CXCR3B and their chemokine-stimulated cellular responses. Jurkat cells express endogenous CXCR3, and exogenous CXCR3A expression enhanced chemotactic activity in response to I-TAC, IP-10, and MIG. By contrast, exogenous expression of CXCR3B and CXCR3Alt eliminated or reduced the CXCR3A-induced chemotactic activity. The PF-4 chemokine did not activate any CXCR3-mediated cellular responses. NanoBiT technology are useful to integrative studies of CXCR3-mediated cell signaling, and expand our knowledge of the cellular responses mediated by molecular interactions among the splicing variants, including cell surface expression, ligand-dependent receptor activation, and chemotaxis.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal-epithelial transitions are fundamental drivers of development and disease, but how these behaviors generate epithelial structure is not well understood. Here, we show that mesenchymal-epithelial transitions promote epithelial organization in the mouse node and notochordal plate through the assembly and radial intercalation of three-dimensional rosettes. Axial mesoderm rosettes acquire junctional and apical polarity, develop a central lumen, and dynamically expand, coalesce, and radially intercalate into the surface epithelium, converting mesenchymal-epithelial transitions into higher-order tissue structure. In mouse Par3 mutants, axial mesoderm rosettes establish central tight junction polarity but fail to form an expanded apical domain and lumen. These defects are associated with altered rosette dynamics, delayed radial intercalation, and formation of a small, fragmented surface epithelial structure. These results demonstrate that three-dimensional rosette behaviors translate mesenchymal-epithelial transitions into collective radial intercalation and epithelial formation, providing a strategy for building epithelial sheets from individual self-organizing units in the mammalian embryo.

Abstract: Phagocytosis plays an important role in maintaining brain homeostasis and when impaired can result in the accumulation of unwanted cellular material. While microglia are traditionally considered the phagocytes of the brain, astrocytes are also capable of phagocytosis and are the most numerous cells in the brain. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), astrocytes can be found surrounding β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques yet they seem unable to eliminate these deposits, suggesting phagocytosis may be impaired in AD. Mechanisms that might diminish astrocyte phagocytosis in AD are currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the autophagy protein beclin 1, which is reduced in AD, plays a role in regulating astrocyte phagocytosis. Specifically, we show that reducing beclin 1 in C6 astrocytes impairs the phagocytosis of latex beads, reduces retromer levels, and impairs retromer recruitment to the phagosomal membrane. Furthermore, we show that these beclin 1-mediated changes are accompanied by reduced expression of the phagocytic receptor Scavenger Receptor Class B type I (SR-BI). Collectively, these findings suggest a critical role for the protein beclin 1 in both receptor trafficking and receptor-mediated phagocytosis in astrocytes. Moreover, these findings provide insight into mechanisms by which astrocytes may become impaired in AD.

Abstract: Summary
The asymmetric divisions of Drosophila neural stem cells (NSCs) produce unequally sized siblings, with most volume directed into the sibling that retains the NSC fate. Sibling size asymmetry results from the preferential expansion of the NSC sibling surface during division. Here, we show that a polarized membrane reservoir constructed by the NSC in early mitosis provides the source for expansion. The reservoir is formed from membrane domains that contain folds and microvilli that become polarized by apically directed cortical flows of actomyosin early in mitosis. When furrow ingression begins and internal pressure increases, the stores of membrane within the apical reservoir are rapidly consumed. Expansion is substantially diminished in NSCs that lack a reservoir, and membrane expansion equalizes when the reservoir is not polarized. Our results suggest that the cortical flows that remodel the plasma membrane during asymmetric cell division function to satisfy the dynamic surface area requirements of unequally dividing cells.
