Abstract: Members of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein family are involved in multiple cellular processes including response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. Here we show that a major FA protein, Fancd2, plays a role in mitochondrial biosynthesis through regulation of mitochondrial translation. Fancd2 interacts with Atad3 and Tufm, which are among the most frequently identified components of the mitochondrial nucleoid complex essential for mitochondrion biosynthesis. Deletion of Fancd2 in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) leads to increase in mitochondrial number, and enzyme activity of mitochondrion-encoded respiratory complexes. Fancd2 deficiency increases mitochondrial protein synthesis and induces mitonuclear protein imbalance. Furthermore, Fancd2-deficient HSPCs show increased mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. By using a cell-free assay with mitochondria isolated from WT and Fancd2-KO HSPCs, we demonstrate that the increased mitochondrial protein synthesis observed in Fancd2-KO HSPCs was directly linked to augmented mitochondrial translation. Finally, Fancd2-deficient HSPCs are selectively sensitive to mitochondrial translation inhibition and depend on augmented mitochondrial translation for survival and proliferation. Collectively, these results suggest that Fancd2 restricts mitochondrial activity through regulation of mitochondrial translation, and that augmented mitochondrial translation and mitochondrial respiration may contribute to HSC defect and bone marrow failure in FA.

Abstract: Background
Islet stellate cells (ISCs) activation is mainly associated with islet fibrosis, which contributes to the progression of type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood.
Methods
In order to investigate this process the current study examined ectopic fat accumulation in rats with high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Levels of lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation and islet function were assessed via intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of lipid metabolism- and ISC activation-related markers was evaluated in cultured ISCs treated with palmitic acid (PA) using quantitative PCR and western blotting. We also overexpressed sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c in ISCs by lentiviral transduction, and assessed the effects on insulin release in co-cultures with isolated rat islets.
Results
HFD increased body weight and ectopic fat accumulation in pancreatic islets. Lipotoxicity caused progressive glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, upregulated α-smooth muscle actin, and stimulated the secretion of extracellular matrix. Lipotoxicity reduced the expression of lipid metabolism-related molecules in ISCs treated with PA, especially SREBP-1c. Overexpression of SREBP-1c in ISCs improved islet viability and insulin secretion in co-cultures.
Conclucions
These results indicate that lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation alters islet function via regulation of lipid metabolism, suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting activated ISC may be an effective treatment for prevention of ISC activation-associated islet dysfunction.

Abstract: Macrophages are dynamic cells whose phenotypes and functions are regulated by surrounding inflammatory mediators after pathogenic infection. Imbalanced polarization of classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages is closely associated with infection-related complications and their severity. The pathway of T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (Tim-3)/galectin-9 (Gal-9) plays an important role in infection by regulating macrophage function. However, the effects of Tim-3/Gal-9 signalling on M1/M2 macrophage polarization are unclear. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with 0.1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). M1/M2 phenotypic macrophage markers were measured 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after stimulation, α-lactose was used to inhibit Gal-9, anti-mouse Tim-3 antibody was used to block Tim-3, recombinant mouse-Gal-9 (rm-Gal-9) was used to activate Tim-3, which were aimed to verify the role of the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway in the balance of M1/M2 macrophages when stimulated with LPS. Short-term LPS stimulation upregulated Gal-9 expression and secretion, enhanced the association between Gal-9 and Tim-3, and activated the Tim-3/Gal-9 signalling pathway, eventually inhibiting M1 polarization. Long-term stimulation downregulated Gal-9 expression and secretion, reduced the association between Gal-9 and Tim-3, and inhibited the Tim-3/Gal-9 signalling pathway, eventually promoting M1 polarization, however, decreased M2 polarization and Gal-9 autocrine functions. Overall, LPS had a biphasic effect on BMDMs polarization through the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway, which was time-dependent.

Abstract: Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM), a crucial component of immune cell infiltrated in tumor microenvironment, is associated with progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, it is still unclear how TAM is induced/accumulated and activated around/in OSCC. In the study herein, we tried to understand how TAM accumulates and activates in the OSCC and how TAM promotes OSCC to convert cancer stem cell (CSC). In this study, first important finding was that the M2 macrophages significantly increased in all twenty human OSCC samples in vivo. Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived CXCL12 effectively attracted monocytes, which displayed M2 macrophage phenotype. Blocking CXCL12 receptor (CXCR4) significantly reduced chemotaxis of M2 macrophage. Polarized M2 macrophage promoted CSC-like transition in OSCC cell line, Cal27 cells. These CSC-like cells significantly expressed higher Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog genes, were stronger positive for CD44 and CD105, increased cell proliferation with less apoptosis, enhanced cell migration, and were resistant to chemotherapy drug, vineristine. These results indicate that CAF effectively attracts monocytes via the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway and induces their differentiation to M2 macrophages. Interestingly, these polarized M2 macrophages promote formation of CSC-like cells from the OSCC lead to enhance OSCC proliferation with less apoptosis. Therefore, our findings have potential to lead to novel therapy for the OSCC to target CXCL12-mediated TAM recruitment.

Abstract: Database screening indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in pathogenesis of endometrial cancer. Among these miRNAs, miR-449a might be involved in tumorigenesis and lower expression of miR-449a was associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of miR-449a and its underlying molecular mechanism in endometrial cancer (EC) has not been investigated. In this study, our analysis found that miR-449a expression is inversely correlated with the stage of EC. Downregulation of miR-449a was correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in the EC patients. Results of functional analyses revealed that overexpression of miR-449a in human EC cells alleviated cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conversely, loss of miR-449a in EC cancer cells facilitated all these cellular activities. Moreover, we identified N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) as a direct and functional target gene of miR-449a in EC cells, and the expression of NDRG1 in 87 EC specimens were inversely correlated with that of miR-449a. Additionally, further studies show that the down-regulation of NDRG1 expression inhibited proliferation and metastasis of EC cells through the PTEN/AKT pathway. Therefore, these results suggest that miR-449a suppresses the growth and metastasis of EC by directly targeting the NDRG1 gene and that the activation of miR-449a may represent an effective therapeutic strategy in EC.

Abstract: Stromal-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) is a chemokine signaling molecule that binds to the transmembrane receptor CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) and carries out important functions in development tissue homeostasis. SDF-1α signaling via CXCR4 regulates the recruitment of stem and precursor cells to support tissue-specific repair or regeneration. In this study, we examined the contribution of SDF-1α signaling to the odontogenic differentiation of stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP) induced by bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2). CXCR4 expression was detected in cultured SCAP and SDF-1α promoted the migration of SCAP in Transwell assays. Blocking SDF-1α signaling by treatment with siRNA significantly affected BMP-2-induced mineralized nodule formation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Moreover, blocking SDF-1α signaling inhibited the BMP-2-induced early expression of runt-related factor-2 (Runx-2) and strongly suppressed the induction of dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1) and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) expression by BMP-2. Furthermore, the interaction between SDF-1α and BMP-2 signaling was mediated via intracellular Smads and Erk activation. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that SDF-1α can significantly promote the migration of SCAP. Moreover, we revealed corequirement of the SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling pathways in the BMP-2-induced odontogenic differentiation of SCAP, and these findings may be applied in new strategies for dental pulp regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The disconnect between the genomic prediction of secondary metabolite biosynthetic potential and the observed laboratory production profile of microorganisms is well documented. While heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) is often seen as a potential solution to bridge this gap, it is not immune to many challenges including impaired regulation, the inability to recruit essential building blocks, and transcriptional and/or translational silence of the biosynthetic genes. Here we report the discovery, cloning, refactoring, and heterologous expression of a cryptic hybrid phenazine-type BGC (spz) from the marine actinomycete Streptomyces sp. CNB-091. Overexpression of the engineered spz pathway resulted in increased production and chemical diversity of phenazine natural products belonging to the streptophenazine family, including bioactive members containing an unprecedented N-formylglycine attachment. An atypical discrete adenylation enzyme in the spz cluster is required to introduce the formylglycine moiety and represents a phylogenetically distinct class of adenylation proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Because small-molecule activators of adenylyl cyclases (AC) affect ACs cell-wide, it is challenging to explore the signaling consequences of AC activity emanating from specific intracellular compartments. We explored this issue using a series of engineered, optogenetic, spatially restricted, photoactivable adenylyl cyclases (PACs) positioned at the plasma membrane (PM), the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and the nucleus (Nu). The biochemical consequences of brief photostimulation of PAC is primarily limited to the intracellular site occupied by the PAC. By contrast, sustained photostimulation results in distal cAMP signaling. Prolonged cAMP generation at the OMM profoundly stimulates nuclear protein kinase (PKA) activity. We have found that phosphodiesterases 3 (OMM and PM) and 4 (PM) modulate proximal (local) cAMP-triggered activity, whereas phosphodiesterase 4 regulates distal cAMP activity as well as the migration of PKA's catalytic subunit into the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) (gp120-gp41)3 is the target for neutralizing antibodies and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). HIV-1 Env is flexible, sampling different conformational states. Before engaging CD4, Env adopts a closed conformation (State 1) that is largely antibody resistant. CD4 binding induces an intermediate state (State 2), followed by an open conformation (State 3) that is susceptible to engagement by antibodies that recognize otherwise occluded epitopes. We investigate conformational changes in Env that induce ADCC in the presence of a small-molecule CD4-mimetic compound (CD4mc). We uncover an asymmetric Env conformation (State 2A) recognized by antibodies targeting the conserved gp120 inner domain and mediating ADCC. Sera from HIV+ individuals contain these antibodies, which can stabilize Env State 2A in combination with CD4mc. Additionally, triggering State 2A on HIV-infected primary CD4+ T cells exposes epitopes that induce ADCC. Strategies that induce this Env conformation may represent approaches to fight HIV-1 infection.

Abstract: The neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine replaces l-serine in proteins and produces Alzheimer-like pathology. In proteoglycans, e.g. glypican-1, this should preclude substitution with heparan sulfate chains. Reduced release of heparan sulfate should increase β-secretase activity and processing of amyloid precursor protein. Cultured cells were treated with β-N-methylamino-l-alanine during the growth-phase and the effect on heparan sulfate substitution and amyloid precursor protein processing was evaluated using antibodies specific for heparan sulfate, the N- and C-termini of the C-terminal fragment of β-cleaved amyloid precursor protein, and amyloid beta followed by immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry or SDS-PAGE. Mouse fibroblasts, N2a neuroblastoma cells and human neural stem cells released less heparan sulfate when grown in the presence of β-N-methylamino-l-alanine. Cells expressing a recombinant, anchor-less glypican-1 secreted heparan sulfate-deficient glypican-1. There was increased processing of amyloid precursor protein in N2a cells when grown in the presence of the neurotoxin. The degradation products accumulated in cytoplasmic clusters. Secretion of amyloid beta increased approx. 3-fold. Human neural stem cells also developed cytoplasmic clusters containing degradation products of amyloid precursor protein. When non-dividing mouse N2a cells or cortical neurons were exposed to β-N-methylamino-l-alanine there was no effect on heparan sulfate substitution in glypican-1 or on amyloid precursor protein processing.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) hold great promise for cardiac studies, but their structural and functional immaturity precludes their use as faithful models of adult myocardium. Here we describe engineered heart slices (EHS), preparations of decellularized porcine myocardium repopulated with hiPSC-CMs that exhibit structural and functional improvements over standard culture. EHS exhibited multicellular, aligned bundles of elongated CMs with organized sarcomeres, positive inotropic responses to isoproterenol, anisotropic conduction of action potentials, and electrophysiological functionality for more than 200 days. We developed a new drug assay, GRIDS, that serves as a “fingerprint” of cardiac drug sensitivity for a range of pacing rates and drug concentrations. GRIDS maps characterized differences in drug sensitivity between EHS and monolayers more clearly than changes in action potential durations or conduction velocities. EHS represent a tissue-like model for long-term culture, structural, and functional improvement, and higher fidelity drug response of hiPSC-CMs.

Abstract: Malignant melanoma (MM) remains the leading cause of skin cancer related death, which has very poor prognosis because of locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis. DEPDC1B (DEP domain-containing protein 1B), has been proved to be associated with some types of malignant tumors. However, the role of DEPDC1B in MM is still unknown. In this study, the expression levels of DEPDC1B in MM tissues were detected by IHC. DEPDC1B knockdown cell lines were constructed, evaluated by Western blot and qRT-PCR, and also used for construction of mice xenograft models. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated by MTT, colony formation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The results indicated significantly up-regulated expression of DEPDC1B in tumor tissues. Moreover, knockdown of DEPDC1B could inhibit cell proliferation while inducing cell apoptosis. The in vivo study demonstrated the significant suppression of tumor growth by knockdown of DEPDC1B. Finally, the results of antibody array proved the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins by DEPDC1B knockdown. Therefore, it could be concluded that DEPDC1B was involved in the development and progression of MM, which may act as promotor for MM and could be a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that can be induced by inhibition of the cystine-glutamate antiporter, system xc–. Among the existing system xc– inhibitors, imidazole ketone erastin (IKE) is a potent, metabolically stable inhibitor of system xc– and inducer of ferroptosis potentially suitable for in vivo applications. We investigated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of IKE in a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) xenograft model and demonstrated that IKE exerted an antitumor effect by inhibiting system xc–, leading to glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation, and the induction of ferroptosis biomarkers both in vitro and in vivo. Using untargeted lipidomics and qPCR, we identified distinct features of lipid metabolism in IKE-induced ferroptosis. In addition, biodegradable polyethylene glycol-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles were employed to aid in IKE delivery and exhibited reduced toxicity compared with free IKE in a DLBCL xenograft model.

Abstract: Summary
The Polymerase Associated Factor 1 complex (PAF1c) functions at the interface of epigenetics and gene transcription. The PAF1c is required for MLL fusion-driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through direct regulation of pro-leukemic target genes such as Hoxa9 and Meis1. However, the role of the PAF1c in normal hematopoiesis is unknown. Here, we discovered that the PAF1c subunit, CDC73, is required for both fetal and adult hematopoiesis. Loss of Cdc73 in hematopoietic cells is lethal because of extensive bone marrow failure. Cdc73 has an essential cell-autonomous role for adult hematopoietic stem cell function in vivo, and deletion of Cdc73 results in cell-cycle defects in hematopoietic progenitors. Gene expression profiling indicated a differential regulation of Hoxa9/Meis1 gene programs by CDC73 in progenitors compared with AML cells, suggesting disease-specific functions. Thus, the PAF1c subunit, CDC73 is essential for hematopoietic stem cell function but exhibits leukemia-specific regulation of self-renewal gene programs in AML cells.

Abstract: Brown and beige adipocytes contribute significantly to the regulation of whole body energy expenditure and systemic metabolic homeostasis not exclusively by thermogenesis through mitochondrial uncoupling. Several studies have provided evidence in rodents that brown and beige adipocytes produce a set of adipokines („batokines”) which regulate local tissue homeostasis and have beneficial effects on physiological functions of the entire body. We observed elevated secretion of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, but not tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) or IL-1β pro-inflammatory cytokines, by ex vivo differentiating human beige adipocytes (induced by either PPARγ agonist or irisin) compared to white. Higher levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 were released from human deep neck adipose tissue biopsies (enriched in browning cells) than from subcutaneous ones. IL-6 was produced in a sustained manner and mostly by the adipocytes and not by the undifferentiated progenitors. Continuous blocking of IL-6 receptor by specific antibody during beige differentiation resulted in downregulation of brown marker genes and increased morphological changes that are characteristic of white adipocytes. The data suggest that beige adipocytes adjust their production of IL-6 to reach an optimal level for differentiation in the medium enhancing browning in an autocrine manner.

Abstract: This study aims to prepare intermediate mesoderm-like cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In the first step, intermediate mesoderm-like cells (IMLCs) and renal epithelial-like cells (RELCs) were extracted from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in a specified media that contained two small molecules, CHIR99021 and TTNPB, along with growth factors, FGF9and BMP7. Then, MEFs were directly converted into IM by genes for the pluripotency factors, which encode the transcription factors; Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM). These unstable intermediate cells were quickly encouraged to form IM with the assistance of CHIR99021 and TTNPB. The results showed that exogenous expression of OSKM factors for four days was adequate to generate partially reprogrammed cells (SSEA1+/Nanog−). Real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry analysis confirmed the presence of the MEF-derived IMs. This study introduced a method for mESCs differentiation to RELCs followed by MEF conversion in an attempt to generate IM by circumventing pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
During mammalian embryogenesis, changes in morphology and gene expression are concurrent with epigenomic reprogramming. Using human embryonic stem cells representing the preimplantation blastocyst (naive) and postimplantation epiblast (primed), our data in 2iL/I/F naive cells demonstrate that a substantial portion of known human enhancers are premarked by H3K4me1, providing an enhanced open chromatin state in naive pluripotency. The 2iL/I/F enhancer repertoire occupies 9% of the genome, three times that of primed cells, and can exist in broad chromatin domains over 50 kb. Enhancer chromatin states are largely poised. Seventy-seven percent of 2iL/I/F enhancers are decommissioned in a stepwise manner as cells become primed. While primed topologically associating domains are largely unaltered upon differentiation, naive 2iL/I/F domains expand across primed boundaries, affecting three-dimensional genome architecture. Differential topologically associating domain edges coincide with 2iL/I/F H3K4me1 enrichment. Our results suggest that naive-derived 2iL/I/F cells have a unique chromatin landscape, which may reflect early embryogenesis.

Abstract: Microglia, the parenchymal immune cells of the central nervous system, orchestrate neuroinflammation in response to infection or damage, and promote tissue repair. However, aberrant microglial responses are integral to neurodegenerative diseases and critically contribute to disease progression. Thus, it is important to elucidate how microglia - mediated neuroinflammation is regulated by endogenous factors. Here, we explored the effect of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), an abundant neurotrophin, on microglial inflammatory responses. NGF, via its high affinity receptor TrkA, downregulated LPS - induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO in primary mouse microglia and inhibited TLR4 - mediated activation of the NF-κB and JNK pathways. Furthermore, NGF attenuated the LPS - enhanced glycolytic activity in microglia, as suggested by reduced glucose uptake and decreased expression of the glycolytic enzymes Pfkβ3 and Ldhα. Consistently, 2DG - mediated glycolysis inhibition strongly downregulated LPS - induced cytokine production in microglial cells. Our findings demonstrate that NGF attenuates pro-inflammatory responses in microglia and may thereby contribute to regulation of microglia - mediated neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of neurological disorders and is accompanied by the production of neurotoxic agents such as nitric oxide. We used stem cell-based phenotypic screening and identified small molecules that directly protected neurons from neuroinflammation-induced degeneration. We demonstrate that inhibition of CDK5 is involved in, but not sufficient for, neuroprotection. Instead, additional inhibition of GSK3β is required to enhance the neuroprotective effects of CDK5 inhibition, which was confirmed using short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of CDK5 and GSK3β. Quantitative phosphoproteomics and high-content imaging demonstrate that neurite degeneration is mediated by aberrant phosphorylation of multiple microtubule-associated proteins. Finally, we show that our hit compound protects neurons in vivo in zebrafish models of motor neuron degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, we demonstrate an overlap of CDK5 and GSK3β in mediating the regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton and that our hit compound LDC8 represents a promising starting point for neuroprotective drugs.

Abstract: CTP synthase (CTPsyn) is a metabolic enzyme essential for the de novo synthesis of CTP the nucleotide. CTPsyn can be compartmented into filamentous structures named cytoophidia. Cytoophidia are conserved in a wide range of species and are highly abundant in Drosophila ovaries. Here we report that cytoophidia elongate upon nutrient deprivation, CTPsyn overexpression or heat shock in Drosophila ovaries. We also show that the curvature of cytoophidia changes during apoptosis. Moreover, cytoophidia can be transported from nurse cells to the oocyte via ring canals. Our study demonstrates that cytoophidia can respond to stress and are very dynamic in Drosophila ovaries.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have become potential targets for the treatment of heart failure (HF). It has been shown that miR-1 can reverse cardiac hypertrophy during the compensatory phase of HF development, but it is unknown whether miR-1 can still reverse cardiac dysfunction and improve cardiac remodeling after HF progresses to the decompensation stage. We established a mouse model of isoproterenol-induced HF and then injected miR-1a-3p agomir (agomir-1) into the tail vein. Echocardiography showed that the mice treated with agomir-1 had significantly increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening. These mice also showed a decrease in the N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, but this remained higher than in controls. Cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis, and glycogen deposition were reduced in mice treated with agomir-1. Furthermore, we found that supplementation of agomir-1 increased the expression of two mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins, mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) and mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I (COX1). In conclusion, our study found that miR-1a-3p alleviated the symptoms of ISO-induced HF in mice by enhancing mitochondrial ND1 and COX1. The results of this work may provide new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HF patients.

Abstract: Integrity of oocytes is of pivotal interest in the medical and zootechnical practice of in vitro fertilization. With time, oocytes undergo deterioration in quality, and ageing oocytes often exhibit compromised competence in fertilization and the subsequent embryonic development. With ageing oocytes and eggs of starfish (Astropecten aranciacus), we addressed the issue by examining changes of the subcellular structure and their performance at fertilization. Ageing eggs were simulated in two different experimental paradigms: i) oocytes were overmatured by 6 hours stimulation with 1-methyladenine (1-MA); ii) oocytes were removed from the gonad and maintained in seawater for 24 or 48 h before applying the hormonal stimulation (1-MA, 70 min). These eggs were compared with normally matured eggs (stimulated after isolation from the gonad with 1-MA for 70 min) with respect to the sperm-induced intracellular Ca2+ signaling and the structural changes of the egg surface. The cytoskeletal and ultrastructural differences in these eggs were assessed by confocal and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. In the two categories of ageing eggs, we have found remarkable structural modifications of the actin cytoskeleton and the cortical vesicles beneath the plasma membrane. At fertilization, these ageing eggs manifested an altered pattern of intracellular Ca2+ release, aberrant actin dynamics, and increased rate of polyspermy often despite full elevation of the fertilization envelope. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of spatio-temporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in the cortex of the eggs, and we postulate that the status of the actin cytoskeleton is one of the major determinants of the oocyte quality that ensures successful monospermic fertilization.

Abstract: Summary
Allosteric regulation of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) by the G-protein chaperone CblA is transduced via three “switch” elements that gate the movement of the B12 cofactor to and from MCM. Mutations in CblA and MCM cause hereditary methylmalonic aciduria. Unlike the bacterial orthologs used previously to model disease-causing mutations, human MCM and CblA exhibit a complex pattern of regulation that involves interconverting oligomers, which are differentially sensitive to the presence of GTP versus GDP. Patient mutations in the switch III region of CblA perturb the nucleotide-sensitive distribution of the oligomeric complexes with MCM, leading to loss of regulated movement of B12 to and/or from MCM and explain the molecular mechanism of the resulting disease.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression signature-based inference of functional connectivity within and between genetic perturbations, chemical perturbations, and disease status can lead to the development of actionable hypotheses for gene function, chemical modes of action, and disease treatment strategies. Here, we report a FuSiOn-based genome-wide integration of hypomorphic cellular phenotypes that enables functional annotation of gene network topology, assignment of mechanistic hypotheses to genes of unknown function, and detection of cooperativity among cell regulatory systems. Dovetailing genetic perturbation data with chemical perturbation phenotypes allowed simultaneous generation of mechanism of action hypotheses for thousands of uncharacterized natural products fractions (NPFs). The predicted mechanism of actions span a broad spectrum of cellular mechanisms, many of which are not currently recognized as “druggable.” To enable use of FuSiOn as a hypothesis generation resource, all associations and analyses are available within an open source web-based GUI (http://fusion.yuhs.ac).

Abstract: Summary
EED (embryonic ectoderm development) is a core component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) during the process of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. However, its function in the mammalian nervous system remains unexplored. Here, we report that loss of EED in the brain leads to postnatal lethality, impaired neuronal differentiation, and malformation of the dentate gyrus. Overexpression of Sox11, a downstream target of EED through interaction with H3K27me1, restores the neuronal differentiation capacity of EED-ablated neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Interestingly, downregulation of Cdkn2a, another downstream target of EED which is regulated in an H3K27me3-dependent manner, reverses the proliferation defect of EED-ablated NSPCs. Taken together, these findings established a critical role of EED in the development of hippocampal dentate gyrus, which might shed new light on the molecular mechanism of intellectual disability in patients with EED mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Ibrutinib (IB) is an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that has demonstrated benefit in B cell cancers, but is associated with a dramatic increase in atrial fibrillation (AF). We employed cell-specific differentiation protocols and optical mapping to investigate the effects of IB and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on the voltage and calcium transients of atrial and ventricular human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). IB demonstrated direct cell-specific effects on atrial hPSC-CMs that would be predicted to predispose to AF. Second-generation BTK inhibitors did not have the same effect. Furthermore, IB exposure was associated with differential chamber-specific regulation of a number of regulatory pathways including the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, which may be implicated in the pathogenesis of AF. Our study is the first to demonstrate cell-type-specific toxicity in hPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, which reliably reproduces the clinical cardiotoxicity observed.

Abstract: Summary
The complement system is vital for anti-microbial defense. In the classical pathway, pathogen-bound antibody recruits the C1 complex (C1qC1r2C1s2) that initiates a cleavage cascade involving C2, C3, C4, and C5 and triggering microbial clearance. We demonstrate a C4-dependent antiviral mechanism that is independent of downstream complement components. C4 inhibits human adenovirus infection by directly inactivating the virus capsid. Rapid C4 activation and capsid deposition of cleaved C4b are catalyzed by antibodies via the classical pathway. Capsid-deposited C4b neutralizes infection independent of C2 and C3 but requires C1q antibody engagement. C4b inhibits capsid disassembly, preventing endosomal escape and cytosolic access. C4-deficient mice exhibit heightened viral burdens. Additionally, complement synergizes with the Fc receptor TRIM21 to block transduction by an adenovirus gene therapy vector but is partially restored by Fab virus shielding. These results suggest that the complement system could be altered to prevent virus infection and enhance virus gene therapy efficacy.

Abstract: Bone resorption, initiated by osteoclasts (OCs), plays an essential role in bone homeostasis. The abnormalities of bone resorption may induce a series of diseases, including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and aseptic peri-implant loosening. Nirogacestat (PF-03084014, PF), a novel gamma-secretase inhibitor, has been used in phase II clinical trial for treatment of desmoid tumor. However, whether it has the therapeutic effect on abnormal bone resorption remains to be evaluated. In this study, we investigated the role of PF in the regulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro, and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone resorption in vivo. It was found that PF could suppress the formation of osteoclasts from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) without causing cytotoxicity, inhibit bone resorption and downregulate the mRNA level of osteoclast-specific markers, including calcitonin receptor (CTR), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (Dc-stamp), Atp6v0d2 (V-ATPase d2) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). Furthermore, Notch2 signaling, as well as RANKL-induced AKT signaling was significantly inhibited in BMMs. Consistent with in vitro observation, we found that PF greatly ameliorated LPS-induced bone resorption. Taken together, our study demonstrated that PF has a great potential to be used in management of osteolytic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiated cells are epigenetically stable, but can be reprogrammed to pluripotency by expression of the OSKM transcription factors. Despite significant effort, relatively little is known about the cellular requirements for reprogramming and how they affect the properties of induced pluripotent stem cells. We have performed high-content screening with small interfering RNAs targeting 300 chromatin-associated factors and extracted colony-level quantitative features. This revealed five morphological phenotypes in early reprogramming, including one displaying large round colonies exhibiting an early block of reprogramming. Using RNA sequencing, we identified transcriptional changes associated with these phenotypes. Furthermore, double knockdown epistasis experiments revealed that BRCA1, BARD1, and WDR5 functionally interact and are required for the DNA damage response. In addition, the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is affected in Brca1, Bard1, and Wdr5 knockdowns. Our data provide a resource of chromatin-associated factors in early reprogramming and underline colony morphology as an important high-dimensional readout for reprogramming quality.

Abstract: An in vitro system of electrical stimulation was used to explore whether an innovative “noisy” stimulation protocol derived from human electromyographic recordings (EMGstim) could promote muscle regeneration. EMGstim was delivered to cultured mouse myofibers isolated from Flexor Digitorum Brevis, preserving their satellite cells. In response to EMGstim, immunostaining for the myogenic regulatory factor myogenin, revealed an increased percentage of elongated myogenin-positive cells surrounding the myofibers. Conditioned medium collected from EMGstim-treated cell cultures, promoted satellite cells differentiation in unstimulated myofiber cell cultures, suggesting that extracellular soluble factors could mediate the process. Interestingly, the myogenic effect of EMGstim was mimicked by exogenously applied ATP (0.1 μM), reduced by the ATP diphosphohydrolase apyrase and prevented by blocking endogenous ATP release with carbenoxolone. In conclusion, our results show that “noisy” electrical stimulations favor muscle progenitor cell differentiation most likely via the release of endogenous ATP from contracting myofibres. Our data also suggest that “noisy” stimulation protocols could be potentially more efficient than regular stimulations to promote in vivo muscle regeneration after traumatic injury or in neuropathological diseases.

Abstract: Background
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) participate in the regeneration of tissue lesions induced by antimetabolite chemotherapy; however, the influence of this class of anti-cancer compounds on the stem cells remains largely unknown.
Methods
The survival of MSCs after exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine was measured by viability and clonogenic assays. MSC morphology, surface marker expression, adhesion potential, cellular velocity and differentiation potential were determined after antimetabolite treatment. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry, and senescence induction was evaluated by beta-galactosidase staining. Gene expression arrays were used to analyze the expression of enzymes involved in DNA metabolism and multidrug resistance.
Results
Here, we show that human primary bone marrow MSCs are relatively resistant to treatment with the widely used antimetabolite drugs 5-FU and gemcitabine. The stem cells were able to largely retain their functional abilities and defining stem cell traits after antimetabolite exposure. MSCs surface markers were found stably expressed, and the characteristic multi-lineage differentiation potential was maintained irrespective of 5-FU or gemcitabine treatment. High expression levels of enzymes involved in DNA metabolism and multidrug resistance transporters may contribute to the resistance to antimetabolite chemotherapy.
Discussion
The observed resistance and functional integrity may form the basis for further investigations of MSCs as a potential therapy for antimetabolite-induced tissue damage.

Abstract: The extracellular heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is known to participate in cell migration and invasion. Recently, we have shown that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are involved in the binding and anchoring of extracellular Hsp90 to the plasma membrane, but the biological relevance of this finding was unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the digestion of heparan sulfate (HS) moieties of HSPGs with a heparinase I/III blend and the metabolic inhibition of the sulfation of HS chains by sodium chlorate considerably impair the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma A-172 and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells stimulated by extracellular native Hsp90. Heparin, a polysaccharide closely related to HS, also reduced the Hsp90-stimulated migration and invasion of cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an intracellular inducer of cell motility bypassing the ligand activation of receptors, restored the basal migration of heparinase- and chlorate-treated cells almost to the control level, suggesting that the cell motility machinery was insignificantly affected in cells with degraded and undersulfated HS chains. On the other hand, the downstream phosphorylation of AKT in response to extracellular Hsp90 was substantially impaired in heparinase- and chlorate-treated cells as compared to untreated cells. Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that cell surface HSPGs play an important role in the migration and invasion of cancer cells stimulated by extracellular Hsp90 and that plasma membrane-associated HSPGs are required for the efficient transmission of signal from extracellular Hsp90 into the cell.

Abstract: Although serine/threonine-protein kinases are found to participate in a wide range of cancer progression, the involvement of protein kinase D3 (PRKD3) in gastric cancer has not been explored. Here, we investigated the role of PRKD3 in gastric cancer (GC) and its potential mechanisms. PRKD3 was over-expressed in gastric cancer tissues and cells. In vitro, PRKD3 ectopic expression accelerated the proliferation and growth of GES-1, SGC7901 and MKN-28 cells. By contrast, PRKD3 knockdown suppressed the proliferation of SGC7901 and MKN-28 GC cells. In vivo, xenograted tumorigenesis was blunted by PRKD3 silencing. Mechanistically, PRKD3 up-regulated 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) and activated glycolysis as shown by increased glucose consumption and lactate production. Knockdown of PFKFB3 suppressed the glycolysis in gastric cancer cells with highly expressed PRKD3 but not in PRKD3 silenced cells. PRKD3 over-expression induced phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 was critical for the up-regulation of glycolytic enzyme PFKFB3. Furthermore, PRKD and PFKFB3 inhibitor suppressed the viability of GC cells. Our results suggest that targeting PRKD3/p65/PFKFB3 cascade maybe a promising therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.

Abstract: Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity and is considered to be an inflammatory disorder characterized by fatty acid accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipotoxicity. We have previously reported that epoxyeicosatrienoic acid-agonist (EET-A) has multiple beneficial effects on cardiac, renal and adipose tissue function while exhibiting both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. We hypothesized that EET-A intervention would play a central role in attenuation of obesity-induced steatosis and hepatic fibrosis that leads to NAFLD.
Methods
We studied the effect of EET-A on fatty liver using db/db mice as a model of obesity. Mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks and administered EET-A twice weekly for the final 8 weeks.
Results
db/db mice fed HFD significantly increased hepatic lipid accumulation as manifested by increases in NAS scores, hepatic fibrosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation, and decreases in mitochondrial mitofusin proteins (Mfn 1/2) and anti-obesity genes Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and Cellular Repressor of E1A-Stimulated Genes 1 (CREG1). EET-A administration reversed the decrease in these genes and reduced liver fibrosis. Knockout of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) in EET-A treated mice resulted in a reversal of the beneficial effects of EET-A administration.
Conclusions
EET-A intervention diminishes fatty acid accumulation, fibrosis, and NFALD associated with an increase in HO-1-PGC1α and increased insulin receptor phosphorylation. A pharmacological strategy involving EETs may offer a potential therapeutic approach in preventing fibrosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the development of NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
A protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) for detecting and localizing intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs) was built by bisection of miniSOG, a fluorescent flavoprotein derived from the light, oxygen, voltage (LOV)-2 domain of Arabidopsis phototropin. When brought together by interacting proteins, the fragments reconstitute a functional reporter that permits tagged protein complexes to be visualized by fluorescence light microscopy (LM), and then by standard as well as “multicolor” electron microscopy (EM) via the photooxidation of 3-3′-diaminobenzidine and its derivatives.

Abstract: Summary
Covalent kinase inhibitors, which typically target cysteine residues, represent an important class of clinically relevant compounds. Approximately 215 kinases are known to have potentially targetable cysteines distributed across 18 spatially distinct locations proximal to the ATP-binding pocket. However, only 40 kinases have been covalently targeted, with certain cysteine sites being the primary focus. To address this disparity, we have developed a strategy that combines the use of a multi-targeted acrylamide-modified inhibitor, SM1-71, with a suite of complementary chemoproteomic and cellular approaches to identify additional targetable cysteines. Using this single multi-targeted compound, we successfully identified 23 kinases that are amenable to covalent inhibition including MKNK2, MAP2K1/2/3/4/6/7, GAK, AAK1, BMP2K, MAP3K7, MAPKAPK5, GSK3A/B, MAPK1/3, SRC, YES1, FGFR1, ZAK (MLTK), MAP3K1, LIMK1, and RSK2. The identification of nine of these kinases previously not targeted by a covalent inhibitor increases the number of targetable kinases and highlights opportunities for covalent kinase inhibitor development.

Abstract: Bats, unique among mammals with powered flight, have many species with the longest size-proportionate lifespan of all mammals. Evolutionary adaptations would have been required to survive the elevated body temperatures during flight. Heat shock protein (HSP), highly conserved master regulators of cell stress, expression was examined across tissues and various cell lines in bats. Basal expression level of major HSPs (HSP70 and HSP90) is significantly higher in two different bat species compared to other mammals. This HSP expression could be a bat-unique, key factor to modulate cellular stress and death. Consequently, bat cells survive prolonged heat treatment, along with other stress stimuli, in a HSP-dependent manner, whereas other mammalian cells succumbed. This suggests HSP expression in bats could be an important adaption to intrinsic metabolic stresses like flight and therefore an important model to study stress resilience and longevity in general.

Abstract: Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiation from multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) into mature oligodendrocytes is driven by thyroid hormone and mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). We show that several nuclear receptors display strong changes in expression levels between fetal and adult NSCs, with an overexpression of TRβ and a lower expression of RXRγ in adult. Such changes may determine the reduced capacity of adult OPCs to differentiate as supported by reduced yield of maturation and compromised mRNA expression of key genes. RXRγ may be the determinant of these differences, on the evidence of reduced number of mature oligodendrocytes and increased number of proliferating OPCs in RXRγ−/− cultures. Such data also points to RXRγ as an important regulator of the cell cycle exit, as proved by the dysregulation of T3-induced cell cycle exit-related genes. Our data highlight the biological differences between fetal and adult OPCs and demonstrate the essential role of RXRγ in the T3-mediated OPCs maturation process.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant type of primary brain tumor and is characterized by its sudden onset and invasive growth into the brain parenchyma. The invasive tumor cells evade conventional treatments and are thought to be responsible for the ubiquitous tumor regrowth. Understanding the behavior of these invasive tumor cells and their response to therapeutic agents could help improve patient outcome. In this study, we present a GBM tumorsphere migration model with high biological complexity to study migrating GBM cells in a quantitative and qualitative manner. We demonstrated that the in vitro migration model could be used to investigate both inhibition and stimulation of cell migration with oxaliplatin and GBM-derived extracellular vesicles, respectively. The intercellular heterogeneity within the GBM tumorspheres was examined by immunofluorescent staining of nestin/vimentin and GFAP, which showed nestin and vimentin being highly expressed in the periphery of tumorspheres and GFAP mostly in cells in the tumorsphere core. We further showed that this phenotypic gradient was present in vivo after implanting dissociated GBM tumorspheres, with the cells migrating away from the tumor being nestin-positive and GFAP-negative. These results indicate that GBM tumorsphere migration models, such as the one presented here, could provide a more detailed insight into GBM cell biology and prove highly relevant as a pre-clinical platform for drug screening and assessing drug response in the treatment of GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are susceptible to numerical and structural chromosomal alterations during long-term culture. We show that mitotic errors occur frequently in hPSCs and that prometaphase arrest leads to very rapid apoptosis in undifferentiated but not in differentiated cells. hPSCs express high levels of proapoptotic protein NOXA in undifferentiated state. Knocking out NOXA by CRISPR or upregulation of the anti-apoptosis gene BCL-XL significantly reduced mitotic cell death, allowing the survival of aneuploid cells and the formation of teratomas significantly larger than their wild-type parental hPSCs. These results indicate that the normally low threshold of apoptosis in hPSCs can safeguard their genome integrity by clearing cells undergoing abnormal division. The amplification of BCL2L1 on chromosome 20q11.21, a frequent mutation in hPSCs, although not directly oncogenic, reduces the sensitivity of hPSCs to damage caused by erroneous mitosis and increases the risk of gaining aneuploidy.

Abstract: Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) are a promising source for tissue engineering and stem cell transplantation. However, long-term in vitro culture and expansion lead to the loss of stemness of SHEDs, compromising their therapeutic benefits. Hypoxia plays an essential role in controlling the stem cell behavior of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of cobalt chloride (CoCl2), a hypoxia-mimetic agent, on the stem cell marker expression and osteogenic differentiation of SHEDs. SHEDs were cultured with or without 50 or 100μm CoCl2. Their proliferation, apoptosis, stem cell marker expression, migration ability, and osteogenic differentiation were examined. Culture with 50 and 100μm CoCl2 increased the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in SHEDs without inducing significant cytotoxicity. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of STRO-1+ cells. CoCl2 significantly increased the expression of stem cell markers (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and c-Myc) in a dose-dependent manner. The migration ability was also promoted by CoCl2 treatment. Furthermore, SHEDs cultured in osteogenic medium with CoCl2 showed a dose-dependent reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition. The expression of osteogenic-related genes was also suppressed by CoCl2, especially in the 100-μM CoCl2 group. In conclusion, CoCl2 increased the expression of stem cell markers and inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of SHEDs. These findings may provide evidence supporting the use of in vitro hypoxic environments mimicked by CoCl2 in assisting the clinical application of SHEDs.

Abstract: Cell adhesion and migration are key cell behaviours during gastrulation in early embryos and metastasis in cancers. Cthrc1 is a secreted protein highly conserved among vertebrates; it is upregulated in injured and diseased arteries, as well as in malignant cancers. There is increasing evidence showing that its expression and activity are associated with cancer progression and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which it regulates cell migration, and its implication during early development remains unclear. Here we show that zebrafish Cthrc1a is expressed in hypoblast cells, and is required for cell adhesion and migration during gastrulation. Knockdown of cthrc1a in whole embryo inhibits epiboly and convergent extension movements, and reduces the elongation of anteroposterior axis. Cell adhesion assay indicates that Cthrc1a is necessary for mesendoderm cells to interact with fibronectin-coated substratum, and to extend polarised cellular protrusions. Moreover, secreted Cthrc1a proteins diffuse efficiently between blastoderm cells and are recruited by neighbouring cells in an integrin-dependent manner. Consistently, there exists a functional interaction between Cthrc1a and integrin β1 in anteroposterior axis elongation. These results provide insight into the function of Cthrc1a in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration during embryonic axis elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is a versatile cofactor that catalyzes a plethora of chemical transformations within a cell. Although many human PLP-dependent enzymes (PLP-DEs) with crucial physiological and pathological roles are known, a global method enabling their cellular profiling is lacking. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a cofactor probe for the identification of human PLP-binding proteins in living cells. Striking selectivity of human pyridoxal kinase led to a customized labeling strategy covering a large fraction of known PLP-binding proteins across various cancer-derived cell lines. Labeling intensities of some PLP-DEs varied depending on the cell type while the overall protein expression levels of these proteins remained constant. In addition, we applied the methodology for in situ screening of PLP-antagonists and unraveled known binders as well as unknown off-targets. Taken together, our proteome-wide method to study PLP-DEs in human cancer-derived cells enables global understanding of the interactome of this important cofactor.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans is a gut commensal and opportunistic pathogen. The transition between yeast and invasive hyphae is central to virulence but has unknown functions during commensal growth. In a mouse model of colonization, yeast and hyphae co-occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract. However, competitive infections of C. albicans homozygous gene disruption mutants revealed an unanticipated, inhibitory role for the yeast-to-hypha morphogenesis program on commensalism. We show that the transcription factor Ume6, a master regulator of filamentation, inhibits gut colonization, not by effects on cell shape, but by activating the expression of a hypha-specific pro-inflammatory secreted protease, Sap6, and a hyphal cell surface adhesin, Hyr1. Like a ume6 mutant, strains lacking SAP6 exhibit enhanced colonization fitness, whereas SAP6-overexpression strains are attenuated in the gut. These results reveal a tradeoff between fungal programs supporting commensalism and virulence in which selection against hypha-specific markers limits the disease-causing potential of this ubiquitous commensal-pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
Pyruvate is a key metabolite in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Exogenous pyruvate modulates metabolism, provides cellular protection, and is essential for the maintenance of human preimplantation embryos and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). However, little is known about how pyruvate contributes to cell-fate determination during epiblast stage. In this study, we used hESCs as a model to demonstrate that elevated exogenous pyruvate shifts metabolic balance toward oxidative phosphorylation in both maintenance and differentiation conditions. During differentiation, pyruvate potentiates mesoderm and endoderm lineage specification. Pyruvate production and its mitochondrial metabolism are required in BMP4-induced mesoderm differentiation. However, the TCA-cycle metabolites do not have the same effect as pyruvate on differentiation. Further study shows that pyruvate increases AMP/ATP ratio, activates AMPK, and modulates the mTOR pathway to enhance mesoderm differentiation. This study reveals that exogenous pyruvate not only controls metabolism but also modulates signaling pathways in hESC differentiation.

Abstract: Interferon-α (IFN-α) resists viral infections by triggering the transcription of a diverse range of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, information about the Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) IFN-α (PcIFN-α) has not been reported. In this study, a PcIFN-α gene was amplified, which encoded a protein of 193 amino acids with a 26-amino acid signal peptide sharing 72.16–95.70% identity with other avians in Aves. After expression in prokaryote, PcIFN-α was analyzed for its physicochemical property and antiviral activity. Intriguingly, compared with chicken IFN-α, an effective viral infection therapeutic agent, PcIFN-α showed superior anti-VSV, NDV, and AIV activities, which were then abrogated by rabbit anti-PcIFN-α antibodies in vitro. Moreover, PcIFN-α was shown to be highly sensitive to trypsin; however, it remained stable despite changes in pH and temperature. Additionally, PcIFN-α induced the transcriptional or translational levels of Mx1 and ISG12 genes time-dependently. Overall, the present study revealed that PcIFN-α is a potential novel effective therapeutic agent in antiviral defense responses in peafowl, improving understanding of its involvement in bird antiviral defense.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived developmental lineages are key tools for in vitro mechanistic interrogations, drug discovery, and disease modeling. iPSCs have previously been differentiated to endothelial cells with blood-brain barrier (BBB) properties, as defined by high transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), low passive permeability, and active transporter functions. Typical protocols use undefined components, which impart unacceptable variability on the differentiation process. We demonstrate that replacement of serum with fully defined components, from common medium supplements to a simple mixture of insulin, transferrin, and selenium, yields BBB endothelium with TEER in the range of 2,000–8,000 Ω × cm2 across multiple iPSC lines, with appropriate marker expression and active transporters. The use of a fully defined medium vastly improves the consistency of differentiation, and co-culture of BBB endothelium with iPSC-derived astrocytes produces a robust in vitro neurovascular model. This defined differentiation scheme should broadly enable the use of human BBB endothelium for diverse applications.

Abstract: Summary
DEAD-box ATP-dependent helicases (DEAH/D) are a family of conserved genes predominantly involved in gene expression regulation and RNA processing. As its prototype, eIF4AI is an essential component of the protein translation initiation complex. Utilizing a screening system based on wild-type eIF4AI and its L243G mutant with a changed linker domain, we discovered an eIF4AI inhibitor, sanguinarine (SAN) and used it to study the catalytic mechanism of eIF4AI. Herein, we describe the crystal structure of the eIF4AI-inhibitor complex and demonstrate that the binding site displays certain specificity, which can provide the basis for drug design to target eIF4AI. We report that except for competitive inhibition SAN's possible mechanism of action involves interference with eIF4AI catalytic cycling process by hindering the formation of the closed conformation of eIF4AI. In addition, our results highlight a new targetable site on eIF4AI and confirm eIF4AI as a viable pharmacological target.

Abstract: Summary
It remains largely unclear how stem cells regulate bioenergetics and genome integrity to ensure tissue homeostasis. Here, our integrative gene analyses suggest that metabolic and genotoxic stresses may underlie the common functional defects of both fetal and adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) upon loss of DPY30, an epigenetic modulator that facilitates H3K4 methylation. DPY30 directly regulates expression of several key glycolytic genes, and its loss in HSPCs critically impaired energy metabolism, including both glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways. We also found significant increase in DNA breaks as a result of impaired DNA repair upon DPY30 loss, and inhibition of DNA damage response partially rescued clonogenicity of the DPY30-deficient HSPCs. Moreover, CDK inhibitor p21 was upregulated in DPY30-deficient HSPCs, and p21 deletion alleviated their functional defect. These results demonstrate that epigenetic mechanisms by H3K4 methylation play a crucial role in HSPC function through control of energy metabolism and protecting genome integrity.

Abstract: The role of plasma membrane composition and dynamics in the activation process of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is still poorly understood. In this study we have investigated how signaling via the RTK, platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor (PDGFR-β) is affected by Dynasore or Dyngo-4a, which are commonly used dynamin inhibitors. PDGFR-β preferentially internalizes via clathrin-coated pits and in this pathway, Dynamin II has a major role in the formation and release of vesicles from the plasma membrane by performing the membrane scission. We have found that dynamin inhibitors impedes the activation of PDGFR-β by impairing ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor monomers, which leads to a subsequent lack of phosphorylation and activation both of receptors and downstream effectors, such as ERK1/2 and AKT. In contrast, dynamin inhibitors did not affect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dimerization and phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that there is a link between plasma membrane dynamics and PDGFR-β activation, and that this link is not shared with the epidermal growth factor receptor.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) depend on regulatory cytokines from the marrow microenvironment. From an unbiased cytokine screen of murine marrow supernatants, we identified C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) as an endothelial cell-secreted hematopoietic growth factor. Following treatment with CCL5, hematopoietic regeneration is accelerated and survival is prolonged after radiation. In mice with deletion of Ccr5, hematopoietic regeneration is delayed compared to control mice. Deletion of Ccr5 specifically in hematopoietic cells was sufficient to delay regeneration, while the deletion of Ccr5 in stromal/endothelial cells was not. Mechanistically, CCL5 promotes hematopoietic cell cycling and cell survival. Like murine hematopoietic cells, human hematopoietic cells (cord blood, healthy marrow, and peripheral blood) increase CCR5 expression after radiation exposure to promote cell survival. These data establish that CCL5 and CCR5 signaling play critical roles in hematopoietic regeneration and could serve as therapeutic targets to shorten the duration of myelosuppression.

Abstract: Summary
Interference with the signaling activity of the N-myristoylated nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase Src is considered a viable approach in anti-cancer drug discovery. However, ATP-competitive Src inhibitors have not reached the clinic yet and alternative approaches are in high demand. The UNC119A/B proteins bind the myristoylated N terminus of Src and thereby mediate energy-driven spatial cycles that maintain Src enrichment at the plasma membrane, which is critical for Src signaling activity. We describe the discovery of a potent and specific inhibitor of the UNC119-Src interaction with unprecedented chemotype. The inhibitor binds to UNC119 in cells, and induces redistribution of Src to endomembranes and reduction of activating Src autophosphorylation on Y419. UNC119 inhibition in Src-dependent colorectal cancer cells results in the specific reduction of cell growth and clonogenic potential. Our results demonstrate that small-molecule interference with the dynamics of the Src spatial cycle may provide an opportunity to impair oncogenic Src signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are metabolic disorders that are linked to microbiome alterations. However, their co-occurrence poses challenges in disentangling microbial features unique to each condition. We analyzed gut microbiomes of lean non-diabetic (n = 633), obese non-diabetic (n = 494), and obese individuals with T2D (n = 153) from German population and metabolic disease cohorts. Microbial taxonomic and functional profiles were analyzed along with medical histories, serum metabolomics, biometrics, and dietary data. Obesity was associated with alterations in microbiome composition, individual taxa, and functions with notable changes in Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, and Alistipes, as well as in serum metabolites that correlated with gut microbial patterns. However, microbiome associations were modest for T2D, with nominal increases in Escherichia/Shigella. Medications, including antihypertensives and antidiabetics, along with dietary supplements including iron, were significantly associated with microbiome variation. These results differentiate microbial components of these interrelated metabolic diseases and identify dietary and medication exposures to consider in future studies.

Abstract: The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is strongly associated with chronic inflammation. p66Shc is an oxidase previously shown to promote androgen-independent cell growth through generation of reactive oxygen species. However, the importance and biologic functions of p66Shc in HCC are unclear. The clinical significance of p66Shc was assessed in a large cohort of patients with HCC. High Shc1 expression was closely correlated with poor clinical outcomes and early recurrence of HCC. p66Shc expression was also determined in HCC samples and cell lines and found to be increased. Moreover, knockdown of p66Shc significantly inhibited cell proliferation, motility in vitro and tumor growth in vivo and could attenuate the proliferation, and motility of cells stimulated by activated macrophage conditioned media. Mechanically, p66Shc knockdown inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727 in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that high p66Shc expression in HCC predicts a worse prognosis for survival. Furthermore, p66Shc may serve as a novel candidate target for HCC therapy.

Abstract: Nuclear receptor–binding SET domain–containing protein 1 (Nsd1) acts as a histone lysine methyltransferase, and its role in oxidative stress–related abnormal embryonic heart development remains poorly understood. In the present study, H2O2 decreased the expression of Nsd1 and NK2 transcription factor related locus 5 (Nkx2.5). We further focused on Nkx2.5 modulating the transcription of Nsd1 in response to H2O2. Luciferase activity analysis indicated that a regulatory region from − 646 to − 282 is essential for the basal transcriptional activity, in which, an a Nkx2.5-binding element (NKE) was identified at − 412/− 406 of the Nsd1 promoter by electrophoresis mobility shift assay and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. H2O2 obviously reduced the p646-luc promoter activity, and the depletion of Nkx2.5 expression weakened H2O2 inhibition on the p646-luc promoter. The overexpression of Nkx2.5 increase Nsd1 p646-luc promoter activity, but did not affected p646-luc-mut. Furthermore, overexpression and depletion of Nkx2.5 led to the increase and decrease of Nsd1 protein and mRNA levels. These data indicated that H2O2-induced Nsd1 suppression resulted from the decrease of Nkx2.5 expression through the NKE element.

Abstract: Summary
Neurogenesis in specific brain regions in adult mammals decreases with age. Progressive reduction in the proliferation of neural stem and progenitor cells (NS/PCs) is a primary cause of this age-associated decline. However, the mechanism responsible for this reduction is poorly understood. We identify p38 MAPK as a key factor in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in adult neurogenic niches. p38 expression in adult NS/PCs is downregulated during aging. Deletion of p38α in NS/PCs specifically reduces the proliferation of NPCs but not stem cells. Conversely, forced expression of p38α in NS/PCs in the aged mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) restores NPC proliferation and neurogenesis, and prevents age-dependent SVZ atrophy. We also found that p38 is necessary for suppressing the expression of Wnt antagonists DKK1 and SFRP3, which inhibit the proliferation of NPCs. Age-related reduction in p38 thus leads to decreased adult neurogenesis via downregulation of Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Libraries of well-annotated small molecules have many uses in chemical genetics, drug discovery, and therapeutic repurposing. Multiple libraries are available, but few data-driven approaches exist to compare them and design new libraries. We describe an approach to scoring and creating libraries based on binding selectivity, target coverage, and induced cellular phenotypes as well as chemical structure, stage of clinical development, and user preference. The approach, available via the online tool http://www.smallmoleculesuite.org, assembles sets of compounds with the lowest possible off-target overlap. Analysis of six kinase inhibitor libraries using our approach reveals dramatic differences among them and led us to design a new LSP-OptimalKinase library that outperforms existing collections in target coverage and compact size. We also describe a mechanism of action library that optimally covers 1,852 targets in the liganded genome. Our tools facilitate creation, analysis, and updates of both private and public compound collections.

Abstract: Summary
Neurodegenerative disorders are an increasingly common and irreversible burden on society, often affecting the aging population, but their etiology and disease mechanisms are poorly understood. Studying monogenic neurodegenerative diseases with known genetic cause provides an opportunity to understand cellular mechanisms also affected in more complex disorders. We recently reported that loss-of-function mutations in the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62 lead to a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease presenting in childhood. To further elucidate the neuronal involvement, we studied the cellular consequences of loss of p62 in a neuroepithelial stem cell (NESC) model and differentiated neurons derived from reprogrammed p62 patient cells or by CRISPR/Cas9-directed gene editing in NESCs. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that p62 is essential for neuronal differentiation by controlling the metabolic shift from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation required for neuronal maturation. This shift is blocked by the failure to sufficiently downregulate lactate dehydrogenase expression due to the loss of p62, possibly through impaired Hif-1α downregulation and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The findings imply an important role for p62 in neuronal energy metabolism and particularly in the regulation of the shift between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation required for normal neurodifferentiation.

Abstract: Heat stress is one of the wide varieties of factors which cause oxidative stress in vivo; elevated temperature can lead to oxidative stress of dairy cows that affects milk production. The aim of this study was to determine the capacity of the betaine to act as an antioxidant against oxidative stress induced by heat exposure and apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells (mammary alveolar cells, MAC-T). The MAC-T were divided into four treatment groups: control (37 °C), heat stress (HS, 42 °C), betaine (37 °C), and HS + betaine. MAC-T under heat stress (HS) showed increased ROS accumulation, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration, and catalase (CAT) activity. During heat stress, betaine decreased the mRNA expression level of HSP70 and HSP27 in MAC-T. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3, the markers of apoptosis, were also elevated in MAC-T under heat stress. The markers of oxidative stress Nrf-2/HO-1 genes were also elevated in MAC-T under heat stress. Pretreatment of betaine reversed the heat-induced depletion in total antioxidant status, ROS accumulation, and SOD and CAT contents in MAC-T. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Nrf-2/HO-1 expression of heat-exposed MAC-T were also reduced with betaine supplementation. In conclusion, betaine alleviated oxidative stress and apoptosis of MAC-T by inhibiting ROS accumulation.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic wounds are a major complication of diabetes associated with high morbidity and health care expenditures. To investigate the role of colonizing microbiota in diabetic wound healing, clinical outcomes, and response to interventions, we conducted a longitudinal, prospective study of patients with neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Metagenomic shotgun sequencing revealed that strain-level variation of Staphylococcus aureus and genetic signatures of biofilm formation were associated with poor outcomes. Cultured wound isolates of S. aureus elicited differential phenotypes in mouse models that corresponded with patient outcomes, while wound “bystanders” such as Corynebacterium striatum and Alcaligenes faecalis, typically considered commensals or contaminants, also significantly impacted wound severity and healing. Antibiotic resistance genes were widespread, and debridement, rather than antibiotic treatment, significantly shifted the DFU microbiota in patients with more favorable outcomes. These findings suggest that the DFU microbiota may be a marker for clinical outcomes and response to therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Assessing species thermal tolerance requires identification of their thermal strategies and evaluation of their ability to cope with temperature fluctuations. The mobilization of the molecular heat stress response (HSR), which is a proxy for the thermal tolerance, would be part of the strategy of species colonizing highly variable thermal environments. We here investigate multiple parameters of the HSR in the deep-sea vent shrimp Rimicaris exoculata that colonizes such environments. The set points of the HSR induction, compared to those of the coastal species Palaemonetes varians, clearly reflect a high thermotolerance in this species, while the HSR is proved to be rarely mobilized in the R. exoculata natural populations. Finally, the compilation of multiple parameters such as the upper thermal limit and several thresholds of the HSR, as well as thermal behavior observations, allows us to provide a more accurate picture of the combination and complementarity of strategies that can account for the overall thermal tolerance of the species.

Abstract: Summary
Temperate phages can adopt either a lytic or lysogenic lifestyle within their host bacteria. It was recently shown that Bacillus-subtilis-infecting phages of the SPbeta group utilize a peptide-based communication system called arbitrium to coordinate the lysogeny decision. The occurrence of peptide-based communication systems among phages more broadly remains to be explored. Here, we uncover a wide array of peptide-based communication systems utilized by phages for lysogeny decisions. These arbitrium-like systems show diverse peptide codes and can be detected in numerous genetically distant phage types and conjugative elements. The pathogens Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis are commonly infected by arbitrium-carrying mobile elements, which often carry toxins essential for pathogenicity. Experiments with phages containing these arbitrium-like systems demonstrate their involvement in lysogeny decisions. Finally, our results suggest that the peptide-based decision is executed by an antisense RNA that controls the regulator of the lysogenic state.

Abstract: Background/objective
Integrin α5 (ITGA5) as one member of integrins family, plays an important role in promoting cancer cell metastasis and invasion through inducing the communications among different cells or cells with extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the mechanisms underlying ITGA5 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression need to be explored, especially for its O-GlcNAcylation. To this end, the current study was performed to explore the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on ITGA5 expression, as well as to probe the effects of ITGA5 O-GlcNAcylation on CRC progression.
Methods
The expression profiles of ITGA5, OGT and O-GlcNAc in CRC tissues and cells were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), RT-PCR and western blotting. CCK-8, flow cytometry and xenotransplantation assays were used to assess cell growth, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Immunoprecipitation (IP), in vitro O-GlcNAcylation of ITGA5 and enzymatic labelling of O-GlcNAc assays were used to detect the O-GlcNAcylation of ITGA5 protein.
Results
The expression of ITGA5, OGT and O-GlcNAc were all elevated in CRC tissues and cells compared with the normal tissues and cells. Up-regulation of ITGA5 in CRC RKO cells enhanced cell growth and tumorigenesis while decreased cell apoptosis, while down-regulation of ITGA5 in CRC SW620 cells decreased cell growth and tumorigenesis and induced cell apoptosis. Besides, PUGNAc, GlcN or PUGNAc + GlcNAc treatment increased ITGA5 protein expression in RKO and SW620 cells, as well as increased its protein stability via enhancing its O-GlcNAcylation.
Conclusion
Collectively, the present study makes clear that ITGA5 overexpression accelerates the progression of CRC, which is closely associated to its enhanced O-GlcNAcylation.

Abstract: Summary
Definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region in both mice and humans. An ex vivo culture approach has enabled recapitulation and analysis of murine HSC development. Knowledge of early human HSC development is hampered by scarcity of tissue: analysis of both CFU-C and HSC development in the human embryo is limited. Here, we characterized the spatial distribution and temporal kinetics of CFU-C development within early human embryonic tissues. We then sought to adapt the murine ex vivo culture system to recapitulate human HSC development. We show robust expansion of CFU-Cs and maintenance, but no significant expansion, of human HSCs in culture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HSCs emerge predominantly in the middle section of the dorsal aorta in our culture system. We conclude that there are important differences between early mouse and human hematopoiesis, which currently hinder the quest to recapitulate human HSC development ex vivo.

Abstract: Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing tumor thought to arise from remnants of embryonic notochord associated with an aggressive outcome. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are related to tumorigenesis, recurrence, and resistance in cancers. Therefore, chordoma CSCs are possible targets for chordoma treatment. In this study, dysregulated miRNAs were determined in chordoma CSCs and identified their role in chordoma. Dysregulated miRNAs were determined via miRNA microarray and validated through qPCR. miRNAs were transiently transfected to the chordoma cell lines and their roles in proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion capacities and stem-like properties were identified. Finally, a relationship between clinicopathological features and dysregulated miRNAs has been evaluated among 21 chordoma patients. CD133+CD15+ cells exhibited CSC phenotype with increased CSC- and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-related gene expression, invasion, migration, tumorosphere- and colony-forming abilities. In addition, WNT5A, TGF-α, BTG2 and MYCBP genes involved in CSC-related pathways, were targets of miR-140-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-210-5p and miR-574-5p, respectively. Transfection of CSC-related miRNAs also increased migration and invasion along with stem cell phenotype. Finally, we determined that miR-140-3p and miR-148a-3p expressions correlated with Ki67 while miR-140-3p and TGF-α expressions were correlated with p53. Moreover, MYCBP expression was positively correlated with tumor volume, and metastasis was associated with the expression of miR-210-5p and TGF-α in our patient cohort. Through these findings, we conclude that chordoma CSCs have distinctive miRNA profile, which can regulate stem-like properties of chordoma CSCs.

Abstract: Postnatal folliculogenesis, primordial follicle activation and follicular development at early stage are important for normal ovarian function and fertility, and a comprehensive understanding of this process under physiological condition is necessary. To observe the regulation and mechanism of ovarian follicle development during the prepubertal stages, we collected the mouse ovaries from three time points, including 1 day, 7 days, and 4 weeks after birth. We then performed a proteomic analysis using tandem mass tags (TMT) labeling combined with a two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) technique. A total of 706 proteins were determined to be significant differential abundance (P-SDA). Sixty upregulated proteins and 12 downregulated proteins that were P-SDA and 3 significant KEGG pathways (P < 0.05) were found at 7 days vs. 1 day after birth, while 237 upregulated proteins, 271 downregulated proteins and 42 significant KEGG pathways were found for 4 weeks vs. 7 days after birth. Some vital genes (Figla, Ooep, Padi6, Zp3, Hsd3b1, cyp11a1), key pathways (ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, ovarian steroidogenesis, complement and coagulation cascades, PI3K/Akt/mTOR), and metabolic regulation (energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, metal ion metabolism) were found to be related to the postnatal folliculogenesis, primordial follicle activation and follicular development. Finally, qRT-PCR and western blotting verified some vital genes and further elucidated the developmental process of follicles, and the results may contribute to the understanding of the formation and activation of primordial follicle and follicular development. Significance: This study offers the first proteomic insights into mechanisms of follicle development under physiological condition during the prepubertal stages. By comparing P-SDA of mouse ovaries during various period of age, our data reveals that the regulation of primordial follicle formation and activation is significantly different from that of follicular development. These findings demonstrate that many unique molecular mechanisms underlie ovarian development could be used for ovarian disease research.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidation of the role of different cell lineages in the liver could offer avenues to drive liver regeneration. Previous studies showed that SOX9+ hepatocytes can differentiate into ductal cells after liver injuries. It is unclear whether SOX9+ hepatocytes are uni- or bipotent progenitors at a single-cell level during liver injury. Here, we developed a genetic tracing system to delineate the lineage potential of SOX9+ hepatocytes during liver homeostasis and regeneration. Fate-mapping data showed that these SOX9+ hepatocytes respond specifically to different liver injuries, with some contributing to a substantial number of ductal cells. Clonal analysis demonstrated that a single SOX9+ hepatocyte gives rise to both hepatocytes and ductal cells after liver injury. This study provides direct evidence that SOX9+ hepatocytes can serve as bipotent progenitors after liver injury, producing both hepatocytes and ductal cells for liver repair and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Drug-like inhibitors are often designed by mimicking cofactor or substrate interactions with enzymes. However, as active sites are comprised of conserved residues, it is difficult to identify the critical interactions needed to design selective inhibitors. We are developing an approach, named RADD (resistance analysis during design), which involves engineering point mutations in the target to generate active alleles and testing compounds against them. Mutations that alter compound potency identify residues that make key interactions with the inhibitor and predict target-binding poses. Here, we apply this approach to analyze how diaminotriazole-based inhibitors bind spastin, a microtubule-severing AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) protein. The distinct binding poses predicted for two similar inhibitors were confirmed by a series of X-ray structures. Importantly, our approach not only reveals how selective inhibition of the target can be achieved but also identifies resistance-conferring mutations at the early stages of the design process.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in the histone demethylases KDM5A, KDM5B, or KDM5C are found in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) patients. Here, we use the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to delineate how KDM5 contributes to ID and ASD. We show that reducing KDM5 causes intestinal barrier dysfunction and changes in social behavior that correlates with compositional changes in the gut microbiota. Therapeutic alteration of the dysbiotic microbiota through antibiotic administration or feeding with a probiotic Lactobacillus strain partially rescues the behavioral, lifespan, and cellular phenotypes observed in kdm5-deficient flies. Mechanistically, KDM5 was found to transcriptionally regulate component genes of the immune deficiency (IMD) signaling pathway and subsequent maintenance of host-commensal bacteria homeostasis in a demethylase-dependent manner. Together, our study uses a genetic approach to dissect the role of KDM5 in the gut-microbiome-brain axis and suggests that modifying the gut microbiome may provide therapeutic benefits for ID and ASD patients.

Abstract: Summary
The combination of AMD3100 and low-dose FK506 has been shown to accelerate wound healing in vivo. Although AMD3100 is known to work by releasing hematopoietic stem cells into circulation, the mechanism of FK506 in this setting has remained unknown. In this study, we investigated the activities of FK506 in human cells and a diabetic-rat wound model using a non-immunosuppressive FK506 analog named FKVP. While FKVP was incapable of inhibiting calcineurin, wound-healing enhancement with AMD3100 was unaffected. Further study showed that both FK506 and FKVP activate BMP signaling in multiple cell types through FKBP12 antagonism. Furthermore, selective inhibition of BMP signaling abolished stem cell recruitment and wound-healing enhancement by combination treatment. These results shed new light on the mechanism of action of FK506 in acceleration of wound healing, and raise the possibility that less toxic FKBP ligands such as FKVP can replace FK506 for the treatment of chronic wounds.

Abstract: Summary
Melanomas are known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity. However, the role cellular plasticity plays in melanoma tumor progression and drug resistance is not fully understood. Here, we used reprogramming of melanocytes and melanoma cells to induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) to investigate the relationship between cellular plasticity and melanoma progression and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor resistance. We found that melanocyte reprogramming is prevented by the expression of oncogenic BRAF, and in melanoma cells harboring oncogenic BRAF and sensitive to MAPK inhibitors, reprogramming can be restored by inhibition of the activated oncogenic pathway. Our data also suggest that melanoma tumor progression acts as a barrier to reprogramming. Under conditions that promote melanocytic differentiation of fibroblast- and melanocyte-derived iPSCs, melanoma-derived iPSCs exhibited neural cell-like dysplasia and increased MAPK inhibitor resistance. These data suggest that iPSC-like reprogramming and drug resistance of differentiated cells can serve as a model to understand melanoma cell plasticity-dependent mechanisms in recurrence of aggressive drug-resistant melanoma.

Abstract: Retinal neurodegeneration is an early feature in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic process involved in protein and organelle degradation that has been linked in DR. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol in green tea that has beneficial effects in diabetic. however, it is not currently known whether EGCG can regulate Müller cell autophagy. Here, we showed that EGCG increased autophagy by promoting the formation of autophagosomes, increasing lysosomal acidification, and stimulating autophagic flux in Müller cells, while high glucose (HG) induced a decrease in autophagy and an increase in apoptosis. However, retinal Müller cells in HG treated with EGCG showed autophagy machinery activation and reestablishment of cargo degradation, protecting the cells from apoptosis. EGCG could increase the ability of cells to proliferate by increasing autophagy. In an experimental model of diabetic retinopathy, EGCG reduced the reactive gliosis of Müller cells and decreased retinal damage. These results highlight that HG downregulates autophagy and accumulates P62 cargo due to lysosomal dysfunction and then increases apoptosis, which was reversed by treatment with EGCG. This finding might be valuable for developing a novel therapeutic strategy to treat DR.

Abstract: Scaffolding adaptor Gab2 is overexpressed in a subset of high-grade ovarian cancer. Our published work shows that Gab2 via PI3K enhances migratory behaviors and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) features of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. However, it is still unclear how Gab2/PI3K pathway reuglates EMT characteristics and whether Gab2 promotes the growth of ovarian cancer stem cell (CSC)-like population and metastatic growth. In this study, we examined the effects of Gab2 expression on CSC-like cell growth using Aldefluor and tumorshpere assays commonly used for assessing ovarian cancer cells with CSC properties. Gab2 overexpression increased the number of ALDH+ cells and tumorsphere formation in two different ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR5 and OVCAR8, whereas knockdown of Gab2 decreased the number of ALDH+ cells and tumorsphere formation in Caov-3 cells. Furthermore, Gab2 promoted metastatic tumor growth of OVCAR5 in nude mice. Mechanistically, we uncovered that Gab2 via PI3K specifically inhibited miR-200c expression. miR-200c downregulation contributed to the Gab2-enhanced cell migratory behaviors, EMT properties, and the expansion of ALDH+ cells and tumorspheres. Furthermore, Gab2 promoted CD44 expression and cell migration/invasion through miR-200c downregulation. Our findings support a model that Gab2-PI3K pathway via miR-200c downregulation promotes CD44 expression, EMT characteristics, and CSC-like cell growth. Therapies involving miR-200c or targeting CD44 should help treat ovarian cancer with high Gab2 expression.

Abstract: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis is the initial step of atherogenesis and associated with Ca2+ overload. Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM), regulated by tethering proteins such as phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS2), is essential for mitochondrial Ca2+ overload by mediating ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer. In our study, we aimed to investigate the role of PACS2 in ox-LDL-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the underlying mechanisms. Ox-LDL dose- and time-dependently increased cell apoptosis concomitant with mitochondrial Ca2+ elevation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cytochrome c release. Silencing PACS2 significantly inhibited ox-LDL-induced cell apoptosis at 24 h in addition to the effects of ox-LDL on mitochondrial Ca2+, MMP, and ROS at 2 h. Besides, ox-LDL promoted PACS2 localization at mitochondria as well as ER-mitochondria contacts at 2 h. Not only that, ox-LDL upregulated PACS2 expression at 24 h. Furthermore, silencing PACS2 inhibited ox-LDL-induced mitochondrial localization of PACS2 and MAM formation at 24 h. Altogether, our findings suggest that PACS2 plays an important role in ox-LDL-induced EC apoptosis by regulating MAM formation and mitochondrial Ca2+ elevation, implicating that PACS2 may be a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.

Abstract: The Drosophila male stem cell niche is a well characterized structure in which a small cluster of somatic cells send self-renewal signals to neighbouring germ cells. Although the molecular information involved in the stem cell fate have been identified, much less is understand on the mechanisms driving their short-range specific release. Our ultrastructural analysis reveals distinct protrusions of the stem cell plasma membrane that interdigitate with membrane protrusions of the facing hub cells. Some of these protrusions are very elongated and extend into the hub and could correspond to the Mt-Nanotubes. Therefore, the interface between the stem cells and the hub appears more complex than previously reported and the membrane protrusions of the stem cells might represent specialized surface areas involved in the niche-stem cell communication. We also noticed the presence of clathrin-coated vesicles in the germline plasma membrane that might be also involved in delivering information from the hub.

Abstract: The synovial fluids of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) contain elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, which induce the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) and of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in chondrocytes. Mechanical strain has varying effects on organisms depending on the strength, cycle, and duration of the stressor; however, it is unclear under inflammatory stimulation how mechanical strain act on. Here, we show that mechanical strain attenuates inflammatory cytokine-induced expression of matrix-degrading enzymes. Cyclic tensile strain (CTS), as a mechanical stressor, attenuated interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced mRNA expression of ADAMTS4, ADAMTS9, and MMP-13 in normal chondrocytes (NHAC-kn) and in a chondrocytic cell line (OUMS-27). This effect was abolished by treating cells with mechano-gated channel inhibitors, such as gadolinium, transient receptor potential (TRP) family inhibitor, ruthenium red, and with pharmacological and small interfering RNA-mediated TRPV1 inhibition. Furthermore, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus resulting from cytokine stimulation was also abolished by CTS. These findings suggest that mechanosensors such as the TRPV protein are potential therapeutic targets in treating OA.

Abstract: Summary
Sphingolipids are structural membrane components and important eukaryotic signaling molecules. Sphingolipids regulate inflammation and immunity and were recently identified as the most differentially abundant metabolite in stool from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Commensal bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phylum also produce sphingolipids, but the impact of these metabolites on host pathways is largely uncharacterized. To determine whether bacterial sphingolipids modulate intestinal health, we colonized germ-free mice with a sphingolipid-deficient Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain. A lack of Bacteroides-derived sphingolipids resulted in intestinal inflammation and altered host ceramide pools in mice. Using lipidomic analysis, we described a sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway and revealed a variety of Bacteroides-derived sphingolipids including ceramide phosphoinositol and deoxy-sphingolipids. Annotating Bacteroides sphingolipids in an IBD metabolomic dataset revealed lower abundances in IBD and negative correlations with inflammation and host sphingolipid production. These data highlight the role of bacterial sphingolipids in maintaining homeostasis and symbiosis in the gut.

Abstract: Summary
How the covalent modification of mRNA ribonucleotides, termed epitranscriptomic modifications, alters mRNA function remains unclear. One issue has been the difficulty of quantifying these modifications. Using purified HIV-1 genomic RNA, we show that this RNA bears more epitranscriptomic modifications than the average cellular mRNA, with 5-methylcytosine (m5C) and 2′O-methyl modifications being particularly prevalent. The methyltransferase NSUN2 serves as the primary writer for m5C on HIV-1 RNAs. NSUN2 inactivation inhibits not only m5C addition to HIV-1 transcripts but also viral replication. This inhibition results from reduced HIV-1 protein, but not mRNA, expression, which in turn correlates with reduced ribosome binding to viral mRNAs. In addition, loss of m5C dysregulates the alternative splicing of viral RNAs. These data identify m5C as a post-transcriptional regulator of both splicing and function of HIV-1 mRNA, thereby affecting directly viral gene expression.

Abstract: Neutrophils activated during acute lung injury (ALI) form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to capture pathogens. However, excessive NETs can cause severe inflammatory reactions. Macrophages are classified as M1 macrophages with proinflammatory effects or M2 macrophages with anti-inflammatory effects. During ALI, alveolar macrophages (AMs) polarize to the M1 phenotype. This study tested the hypothesis that NETs may aggravate ALI or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) inflammation by promoting alveolar macrophage polarization to the M1 type. Our research was carried out in three aspects: clinical research, animal experiments and in vitro experiments. We determined that NET levels in ARDS patients were positively correlated with M1-like macrophage polarization. NET formation was detected in murine ALI tissue and associated with increased M1 markers and decreased M2 markers in BALF and lung tissue. Treatment with NET inhibitors significantly inhibitor NETs generation, downregulated M1 markers and upregulated M2 markers. Regardless of LPS pre-stimulation, significant secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulated M1 markers were detected from bone marrow-derived macrophages (M0 and M2) cocultured with high concentrations of NETs; conversely, M2 markers were downregulated. In conclusion, NETs promote ARDS inflammation during the acute phase by promoting macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype. We propose that NETs play an important role in the interaction between neutrophils and macrophages during the early acute phase of ALI.

Abstract: Chronic stress has been linked to many diseases resulted from dysfunction of both the nervous system and peripheral organ systems. Yet, the effects of chronic stress on the pancreas have received relatively little attention. This work aims to investigate the influence of chronic stress exposure on both the endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function and morphology and its possible mechanism of action, and also to evaluate the impact of chronic exercise with moderate intensity on ameliorating the stress-induced pancreatic changes. Forty adult male albino rats were used and divided into four groups: control group, exercised group (3 weeks of swimming exercise), stressed group (3 weeks of immobilization stress), and stressed group practicing exercise (3 weeks of exercise, concomitant with 21 daily sessions of stress). On the final day of the experiment, all rats were sacrificed. Biochemical, immunohistochemical, and histological studies were conducted. The results showed that chronic immobilization stress produced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) with increasing exocrine pancreatic injury markers by increasing oxidative and inflammatory status of the pancreatic tissue. Histological study showed the injurious effect of stress on the morphology of pancreatic tissue. Physical exercise protected the pancreas from the negative effects of stress through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, evidenced by increasing pancreatic interleukin 10 and total antioxidant capacity and decreasing pancreatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and malondialdehyde with ameliorating most of the histological changes induced by stress exposure. Physical exercise effectively counteracts chronic stress-induced pancreatic changes through different mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Large-scale RNAi screens are a powerful approach to identify functions of genes in a cell-type-specific manner. For model organisms, genetically identical (isogenic) cells from different cell types are readily available, making comparative studies meaningful. However, large-scale screens in isogenic human primary cells remain challenging. Here, we show that RNAi screens are possible in genetically identical human stem cells, using induced pluripotent stem cells as intermediates. The screens revealed SMARCA4 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A member 4) as a stemness regulator, while balancing differentiation distinctively for each cell type. SMARCA4 knockdown in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells caused impaired self-renewal in vitro and in vivo with skewed myeloid differentiation; whereas, in neural stem cells, it impaired self-renewal while biasing differentiation toward neural lineage, through combinatorial SWI/SNF subunit assembly. Our findings pose a powerful approach for deciphering human stem cell biology and attribute distinct roles to SMARCA4 in stem cell maintenance.

Abstract: Background
Cell metabolic pathways are highly conserved among species and change rapidly in response to drug stimulation. Therefore, we explore the effects of angiotensin-(1-7) in a primary cell model of cardiac fibrosis established in angiotensin II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts via metabolomics analysis and further clarify the potential protective mechanism of angiotensin-(1-7).
Methods and Results
After exposing cardiac fibroblasts to angiotensin II and/or angiotensin-(1-7), 172 metabolites in these cells were quantified and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data were subsequently analyzed by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis to shortlist biochemically significant metabolites associated with the antifibrotic action of angiotensin-(1-7). Seven significant metabolites were identified: 10,13-dimethyltetradecanoic acid, arachidonic acid, aspartic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), glutathione, palmitelaidic acid, and pyroglutamic acid. By metabolic network analysis, we found that these metabolites were involved in six metabolic pathways, including arachidonic acid metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, and the γ-glutamyl cycle. Since these metabolic pathways are related to calcium balance and oxidative stress, we further verified that angiotensin-(1-7) suppressed the abnormal extracellular calcium influx and excessive accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in angiotensin II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that angiotensin-(1-7) suppressed the abnormal calcium- and ROS-dependent activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKIIδ), the increased expression of CaMKIIδ-related proteins (NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), cellular communication network factor 2 (CTGF), and p-ERK1/2), and excessive collagen deposition in vitro and in vivo.
Conclusions
Angiotensin-(1-7) can ameliorate the angiotensin II-stimulated metabolic perturbations associated with cardiac fibroblast activation. These metabolic changes indicate that modulation of calcium- and ROS-dependent activation of CaMKIIδ mediates the activity of angiotensin-(1-7) against cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, pyroglutamic acid and arachidonic acid may be potential biomarkers for monitoring the antifibrotic action of angiotensin-(1-7).

Abstract: Simple and pure synthetic coating substrates are needed to overcome the disadvantages of traditional coating products like animal derived Matrigel in stem cell research. Since integrins are of great importance in cell adhesion and cell-ECM communication, in this study, a commercially available integrin array established by synthetic integrin binding peptides is used to screen coating substrates for iPSCs and NEPs. The results showed that binding peptides of integrin α5β1, αVβ1, αMβ2 and αIIbβ3 supported cell adhesion of iPSCs, while α5β1, αVβ1 and αIIbβ3 binding peptides supported NEPs adhesion. Additionally, integrin α5β1 binding peptide was revealed to support rapid expansion of iPSCs and iPSC-derived NEPs, as well as the process of NEPs generation, with equal efficiency as Matrigel. In this work, we demonstrated that by supporting stem cell growth in an integrin dependent manner, the integrin array and coating system has the potential to develop more precise and efficient systems in neurological disease modeling.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant tumors. Invasion and metastasis can occur in the early stage of pancreatic cancer, contributing to the poor prognosis. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms underlying invasion and metastasis. Using mass spectrometry, we found that Integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6) was more highly expressed in a highly invasive pancreatic cancer cell line (PC-1.0) than in a less invasive cell line (PC-1). Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we observed significant decreases in invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells after inhibiting ITGA6. Based on data in TCGA, high ITGA6 expression significantly predicted poor prognosis. By using Co-IP combined mass spectrometry, we found that ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), which was also highly expressed in PC-1.0, interacted with ITGA6. Similar to ITGA6, high RPSA expression promoted invasion and metastasis and indicated poor prognosis. Interestingly, although ITGA6 and RPSA interacted, they did not mutually regulate each other. ITGA6 and RPSA affected invasion and metastasis via the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, respectively. Inhibiting ITGA6 significantly reduced the expression of p-AKT, while inhibiting RPSA led to the downregulation of p-ERK1/2. Compared with the inhibition of ITGA6 or RPSA alone, the downregulation of both ITGA6 and RPSA weakened invasion and metastasis to a greater extent and led to the simultaneous downregulation of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2. Our research indicates that the development of drugs targeting both ITGA6 and RPSA may be an effective strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Pig embryonic stem cells (pESCs) have been considered an important candidate for preclinical research on human therapies. However, the lack of understanding of pig pluripotent networks has hampered establishment of authentic pESCs. Here, we report that FGF2, ACTVIN, and WNT signaling are essential to sustain pig pluripotency in vitro. Newly derived pESCs were stably maintained over an extended period, and capable of forming teratomas that contained three germ layers. Transcriptome analysis showed that pESCs were developmentally similar to late epiblasts of preimplantation embryos and in terms of biological functions resembled human rather than mouse pluripotent stem cells. However, the pESCs had distinct features such as coexpression of SSEA1 and SSEA4, two active X chromosomes, and a unique transcriptional pattern. Our findings will facilitate both the development of large animal models for human stem cell therapy and the generation of pluripotent stem cells from other domestic animals for agricultural use.

Abstract: Summary
The relationship between diabetes and endothelial dysfunction remains unclear, particularly the association with pathological activation of calpain, an intracellular cysteine protease. Here, we used human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) to investigate the effects of diabetes on vascular health. Our results indicate that iPSC-ECs exposed to hyperglycemia had impaired autophagy, increased mitochondria fragmentation, and was associated with increased calpain activity. In addition, hyperglycemic iPSC-ECs had increased susceptibility to cell death when subjected to a secondary insult—simulated ischemia-reperfusion injury (sIRI). Importantly, calpain inhibition restored autophagy and reduced mitochondrial fragmentation, concurrent with maintenance of ATP production, normalized reactive oxygen species levels and reduced susceptibility to sIRI. Using a human iPSC model of diabetic endotheliopathy, we demonstrated that restoration of autophagy and prevention of mitochondrial fragmentation via calpain inhibition improves vascular integrity. Our human iPSC-EC model thus represents a valuable platform to explore biological mechanisms and new treatments for diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction.

Abstract: ErbB3, which belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is involved in progression of several human cancers and a tight regulation of its expression is crucial. An important mechanism for regulation of ErbB proteins is endocytosis and we recently showed that ErbB3, contrary to other ErbB proteins, like EGFR and ErbB2, is constitutively internalized and degraded. Several studies show that protein kinase C (PKC) can regulate the activation, localization and stability of EGFR and ErbB2. Activation of PKC causes their down-regulation from the plasma membrane, but instead of being degraded the receptors accumulate in an endosomal recycling compartment. Since little is known about possible connections between ErbB3 and PKC, we have in the present study investigated effects PKC activity has on ErbB3 stability and intracellular trafficking. While PKC inhibition tends to increase ErbB3 degradation, activation of PKC causes ErbB3 stabilization. The stabilization was not due to inhibited internalization, on the contrary we find that expression of ErbB3 at the plasma membrane is reduced upon PMA-induced PKC activation. However, while endocytosed ErbB3 under normal conditions and upon PKC inhibition is found in early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) positive early endosomes and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) positive late endosomes/lysosomes, indicating that it follows the classic degradative pathway, ErbB3 localizes to EEA1 and LAMP1 negative compartments upon PMA-induced activation of PKC. Altogether this shows that PKC regulates the stability of ErbB3, and knockdown experiments show that PKCδ is essential in this process. A likely explanation is that PKC regulates endosomal sorting of ErbB3 and that activated PKC sorts ErbB3 away from the degradative pathway.

Abstract: Maternal obesity is associated with adverse effects on the health of offsprings. Consumption of a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet has been found to promote abnormal fatty acid metabolism in adipose tissue. Therefore, we hypothesised that maternal obesity combined with an offspring HC diet would alter the fatty acid metabolism of adipose tissue and subsequently contribute to offspring obesity. Leprdb/+ mice were used to model pre-pregnancy maternal obesity and the C57BL/6 wildtype were used as a control group. Offspring were fed either HC diet or a normal-carbohydrate (NC) diet after weaning. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) were collected from offspring at 20 weeks of age and their fatty acid metabolome was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that HC diet increased the body weight of offspring (males increased by 14.70% and females increased by 1.05%) compared to control mothers. However, maternal obesity alone caused a 7.9% body weight increase in female offspring. Maternal obesity combined with an offspring HC diet resulted in dynamic alterations of the fatty acid profiles of adipose tissue in male offspring. Under the impact of a HC diet, the fatty acid metabolome was solely elevated in female WAT, whereas, the fatty acid metabolites in BAT showed a similar trend in the male and female offsprings. 6,9-octadecadienoic acid and 12,15-cis-octadecatrienoic acid were significantly affected in female WAT, in response to offspring consumption of a HC diet. Our study demonstrated that maternal obesity and offspring HC diet have different metabolic effects on adipose tissue in male and female offsprings.

Abstract: The transfer of misfolded α-Synuclein (α-Syn) from cell to cell as a prion protein is important in α-Synucleinopathies. Extraneous α-Syn induces apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons by causing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which α-Syn disrupts the mitochondrial function is still unclear. In the present study, we used a gene microarray and western blotting analysis to show that the expression of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (MT-CO2, COXII) increased significantly in SH-SY5Y cells stimulated by α-Syn for 24 h. Furthermore, the decline in ATP levels, the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and the enhanced reactive oxygen species in cells treated by α-Syn was reversed by inhibiting MT-CO2 gene expression. Subsequently, we observed that upregulation of MT-CO2 contributed to the release of cytochrome c and altered the levels of certain mitochondria-localized proteins, such as BCL2 family proteins. Therefore, we hypothesized that after being transferred into dopaminergic neurons, α-Syn injures mitochondria via activating MT-CO2. Our results suggested the initial step of the process by which α-Syn injures dopaminergic neurons and provides new therapeutic targets for α-Syn associated neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are new players in gene regulation but their mechanisms of action are mainly undocumented. In this study, we investigated LncRNA alterations that contribute to lung cancer by analyzing published microarray data in Gene Expression Obminus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA (TCGA) sequencing data. Here, we reported that HAGLR (also called HOXD-AS1) was frequently down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues, and decreased HAGLR expression was clinically associated with shorter survival of LUAD patients. Preclinical studies using multiple LUAD cells and in vivo mouse model indicated that HAGLR could attenuate LUAD cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HAGLR could physically interact with DNMT1, and recruit DNMT1 on E2F1 promoter to increase local DNA methylation. Overall, our study demonstrated that HAGLR promoted LUAD progression by recruiting DNMT1 to modulate the promoter methylation and expression of E2F1, which expanded potential therapeutic strategies for LUAD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal stem cell (ISC) differentiation in the Drosophila midgut requires Delta/Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, which separates the fate of ISCs from differentiating enteroblasts (EBs). Although a canonical Notch signaling cascade is involved in the lateral inhibition, its regulation at the transcriptional level is still unclear. Here we show that the establishment of lateral inhibition between ISC-EB requires two evolutionarily conserved transcriptional co-repressors Groucho (Gro) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) that act differently. Gro functions in EBs with E(spl)-C proteins to suppress Delta expression, inhibit cell-cycle re-entry, and promote cell differentiation, whereas CtBP functions specifically in ISCs to mediate transcriptional repression of Su(H) targets and maintain ISC fate. Interestingly, several E(spl)-C genes are also expressed in ISCs that cooperate with Gro to inhibit cell proliferation. Collectively, our study demonstrates separable and cell-type-specific functions of Gro and CtBP in a lateral inhibition process that controls the proliferation and differentiation of tissue stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans is a commensal fungus of human gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts, but also causes life-threatening systemic infections. The balance between colonization and pathogenesis is associated with phenotypic plasticity, with alternative cell states producing different outcomes in a mammalian host. Here, we reveal that gene dosage of a master transcription factor regulates cell differentiation in diploid C. albicans cells, as EFG1 hemizygous cells undergo a phenotypic transition inaccessible to “wild-type” cells with two functional EFG1 alleles. Notably, clinical isolates are often EFG1 hemizygous and thus licensed to undergo this transition. Phenotypic change corresponds to high-frequency loss of the functional EFG1 allele via de novo mutation or gene conversion events. This phenomenon also occurs during passaging in the gastrointestinal tract with the resulting cell type being hypercompetitive for commensal and systemic infections. A “two-hit” genetic model therefore underlies a key phenotypic transition in C. albicans that enables adaptation to host niches.

Abstract: Summary
Oculomotor neurons, which regulate eye movement, are resilient to degeneration in the lethal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It would be highly advantageous if motor neuron resilience could be modeled in vitro. Toward this goal, we generated a high proportion of oculomotor neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells through temporal overexpression of PHOX2A in neuronal progenitors. We demonstrate, using electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing, that in vitro-generated neurons are bona fide oculomotor neurons based on their cellular properties and similarity to their in vivo counterpart in rodent and man. We also show that in vitro-generated oculomotor neurons display a robust activation of survival-promoting Akt signaling and are more resilient to the ALS-like toxicity of kainic acid than spinal motor neurons. Thus, we can generate bona fide oculomotor neurons in vitro that display a resilience similar to that seen in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Our inability to effectively “drug” targets such as MYC for therapeutic purposes requires the development of new approaches. We report on the implementation of a phenotype-based assay for monitoring MYC expression in multiple myeloma cells. The open reading frame (ORF) encoding an unstable variant of GFP was engineered immediately downstream of the MYC ORF using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in co-expression of both proteins from the endogenous MYC locus. Using fluorescence readout as a surrogate for MYC expression, we implemented a pilot screen in which ∼10,000 compounds were prosecuted. Among known MYC expression inhibitors, we identified cardiac glycosides and cytoskeletal disruptors to be quite potent. We demonstrate the power of CRISPR/Cas9 engineering in establishing phenotype-based assays to identify gene expression modulators.

Abstract: Summary
Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) transplanted into sites of spinal cord injury (SCI) extend large numbers of axons into the caudal host spinal cord. We determined the precise locations of neurons in the graft that extend axons into the caudal host spinal cord using AAV9-Cre-initiated retrograde tracing into floxed-TdTomato-expressing NPC grafts. 7,640 ± 630 grafted neurons extended axons to a single caudal host spinal cord site located 2 mm beyond the lesion, 5 weeks post injury. While caudally projecting axons arose from neurons located in all regions of the graft, the majority of caudally projecting graft neurons (53%) were located within the caudal one-third of the graft. Numerous host corticospinal axons formed monosynaptic projections onto caudally projecting graft neurons; however, we find that the majority of host axonal neuronal projections formed by neural progenitor cell interneuronal “relays” across sites of SCI are likely polysynaptic in nature.

Abstract: Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to tumorigenesis, progression, drug resistance and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanism for the propagation of liver CSCs remains unclear. Herein, we observed low expression of miR-194 in chemoresistant HCC cells. A remarkable decrease of miR-194 was detected in EpCAM or CD133-positive liver CSCs and CSC-enriched hepatoma spheres. Interference miR-194 facilitated liver CSCs expansion by enhancing the self-renewal of liver CSCs. While up-regulating miR-194 inhibited liver CSCs expansion by suppressing the self-renewal of liver CSCs. Furthermore, hepatoma cells with miR-194 overexpression performed more sensitivity to sorafenib treatment. Mechanistically, functional studies found that Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) was a direct target of miR-194. Overexpression of miR-194 inhibited the expression of RAC1 in liver CSCs. Special RAC1 siRNA diminished the discrepancy in liver CSC proportion and the self-renewal capacity between miR-194 overexpression hepatoma cells and control cells, which further confirmed that RAC1 was required in miR-194-inhibited liver CSCs expansion. More importantly, downregulated expression of miR-194 was a predictor of poor prognosis of HCC patients.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium parasites undergo an obligatory and asymptomatic developmental stage within the liver before infecting red blood cells to cause malaria. The hijacked host pathways critical to parasite infection during this hepatic phase remain poorly understood. Here, we implemented a forward genetic screen to identify over 100 host factors within the human druggable genome that are critical to P. berghei infection in hepatoma cells. Notably, we found knockdown of genes involved in protein trafficking pathways to be detrimental to parasite infection. The disruption of protein trafficking modulators, including COPB2 and GGA1, decreases P. berghei parasite size, and an immunofluorescence study suggests that these proteins are recruited to the Plasmodium parasitophorous vacuole in infected hepatocytes. These findings reveal that various host intracellular protein trafficking pathways are subverted by Plasmodium parasites during the liver stage and provide new insights into their manipulation for growth and development.

Abstract: Summary
Patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. HCV infection is linked to various liver abnormalities, potentially contributing to this association. We show that HCV infection increases the levels of hepatic selenoprotein P (SeP) mRNA (SEPP1 mRNA) and serum SeP, a hepatokine linked to insulin resistance. SEPP1 mRNA inhibits type I interferon responses by limiting the function of retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a sensor of viral RNA. SEPP1 mRNA binds directly to RIG-I and inhibits its activity. SEPP1 mRNA knockdown in hepatocytes causes a robust induction of interferon-stimulated genes and decreases HCV replication. Clinically, high SeP serum levels are significantly associated with treatment failure of direct-acting antivirals in HCV-infected patients. Thus, SeP regulates insulin resistance and innate immunity, possibly inducing immune tolerance in the liver, and its upregulation may explain the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in HCV-infected patients.

Abstract: Artesunate (ARS) induced significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HepG2, HeLa, and A549 lines. However, ARS induced ROS-dependent apoptosis in HeLa and A549 cell lines but ROS-independent apoptosis in HepG2 cells. A total of 200μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) significantly induced cytotoxicity in HeLa cells, while H2O2 up to 300μm did not induce cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells, further demonstrating the strong resistance of HepG2 cells to ROS. HeLa cells had much higher basic total glutathione (T-GSH) level than HepG2 cells, while the ratio of basic reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in HepG2 cells was nearly twice than that in HeLa and A549 cells. Inhibition of glutathione markedly enhanced H2O2- or ARS-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa and A549 cell lines but modestly enhanced the cytotoxicity of H2O2 and even did not affect the cytotoxicity of ARS in HepG2 cells. Moreover, addition of GSH remarkably prevented H2O2- or ARS-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa and A549 cell lines, further indicating the involvement of GSH in scavenging ROS in the two cell lines. HepG2 cells exhibited higher catalase activity than HeLa cells, and inhibiting catalase activity by using 3-aminotriazole (3-AT, a specific inhibition of catalase) or catalase siRNA remarkably reduced the resistance of HepG2 cells to ROS, demonstrating the key roles of catalase for the strong resistance of HepG2 cells to ROS. Collectively, catalase activity instead of glutathione level dominates the resistance of cells to ROS.
