Abstract: The focus of this special issue (SI) »Membrane Merger in Conventional and Unconventional Vesicle Secretion« is regulated exocytosis, a universally conserved mechanism, consisting of a merger between the vesicle and the plasma membranes. Although this process evolved with eukaryotic organisms some three billion years ago (Spang et al., 2015), the understanding of physiology and patobiology of this process, especially at elementary vesicle level, remains unclear. Exocytotic fusion consists of several stages, starting by vesicle delivery to the plasma membrane, initially establishing a very narrow and stable fusion pore, that can reversibly open and close several times before it can fully widen. This allows vesicle cargo to be completely discharged from the vesicle lumen and permits vesicle-membrane resident proteins including channels, transporters, receptors and other signalling molecules, to be incorporated into the plasma membrane. The contributions in this SI bring new insights on the complexity of vesicle–based secretion, including discussion that vesicle anatomy appears to modulate exocytotic fusion pore properties and that the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor proteins (SNARE-proteins), not only facilitate pre- and post-fusion stages of exocytosis, but also serve in vesicle navigation within the cytoplasm.

Abstract: Summary
Animals require an immediate response to oxygen availability to allow rapid shifts between oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. These metabolic shifts are highly regulated by the HIF transcription factor. The factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that controls HIF transcriptional activity in an oxygen-dependent manner. We show here that FIH loss increases oxidative metabolism, while also increasing glycolytic capacity, and that this gives rise to an increase in oxygen consumption. We further show that the loss of FIH acts to accelerate the cellular metabolic response to hypoxia. Skeletal muscle expresses 50-fold higher levels of FIH than other tissues: we analyzed skeletal muscle FIH mutants and found a decreased metabolic efficiency, correlated with an increased oxidative rate and an increased rate of hypoxic response. We find that FIH, through its regulation of oxidation, acts in concert with the PHD/vHL pathway to accelerate HIF-mediated metabolic responses to hypoxia.

Abstract: Summary
Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention with potential benefits for healthspan improvement and lifespan extension. In 53 (34 CR and 19 control) non-obese adults, we tested the hypothesis that energy expenditure (EE) and its endocrine mediators are reduced with a CR diet over 2 years. Approximately 15% CR was achieved over 2 years, resulting in an average 8.7 kg weight loss, whereas controls gained 1.8 kg. In the CR group, EE measured over 24 hr or during sleep was approximately 80–120 kcal/day lower than expected on the basis of weight loss, indicating sustained metabolic adaptation over 2 years. This metabolic adaptation was accompanied by significantly reduced thyroid axis activity and reactive oxygen species (F2-isoprostane) production. Findings from this 2-year CR trial in healthy, non-obese humans provide new evidence of persistent metabolic slowing accompanied by reduced oxidative stress, which supports the rate of living and oxidative damage theories of mammalian aging.

Cannabinoid Modulation of Eukaryotic Initiation Factors (eIF2α and eIF2B1) and Behavioral Cross-Sensitization to Cocaine in Adolescent Rats,

Abstract: Summary
Reduced eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 (eIF2)α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) enhances protein synthesis, memory formation, and addiction-like behaviors. However, p-eIF2α has not been examined with regard to psychoactive cannabinoids and cross-sensitization. Here, we find that a cannabinoid receptor agonist (WIN 55,212-2 mesylate [WIN]) reduced p-eIF2α in vitro by upregulating GADD34 (PPP1R15A), the recruiter of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The induction of GADD34 was linked to ERK/CREB signaling and to CREB-binding protein (CBP)-mediated histone hyperacetylation at the Gadd34 locus. In vitro, WIN also upregulated eIF2B1, an eIF2 activator subunit. We next found that WIN administration in vivo reduced p-eIF2α in the nucleus accumbens of adolescent, but not adult, rats. By contrast, WIN increased dorsal striatal levels of eIF2B1 and ΔFosB among both adolescents and adults. In addition, we found cross-sensitization between WIN and cocaine only among adolescents. These findings show that cannabinoids can modulate eukaryotic initiation factors, and they suggest a possible link between p-eIF2α and the gateway drug properties of psychoactive cannabinoids.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways modulate cancer risk, progression, and therapeutic response. We systematically analyzed somatic alterations to provide a comprehensive view of DDR deficiency across 33 cancer types. Mutations with accompanying loss of heterozygosity were observed in over 1/3 of DDR genes, including TP53 and BRCA1/2. Other prevalent alterations included epigenetic silencing of the direct repair genes EXO5, MGMT, and ALKBH3 in ∼20% of samples. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was present at varying frequency in many cancer types, most notably ovarian cancer. However, in contrast to ovarian cancer, HRD was associated with worse outcomes in several other cancers. Protein structure-based analyses allowed us to predict functional consequences of rare, recurrent DDR mutations. A new machine-learning-based classifier developed from gene expression data allowed us to identify alterations that phenocopy deleterious TP53 mutations. These frequent DDR gene alterations in many human cancers have functional consequences that may determine cancer progression and guide therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (ADGRs) encompass 33 human transmembrane proteins with long N termini involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We show the ADGRB1 gene, which encodes Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), is epigenetically silenced in medulloblastomas (MBs) through a methyl-CpG binding protein MBD2-dependent mechanism. Knockout of Adgrb1 in mice augments proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors, and leads to accelerated tumor growth in the Ptch1+/− transgenic MB mouse model. BAI1 prevents Mdm2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination, and its loss substantially reduces p53 levels. Reactivation of BAI1/p53 signaling axis by a brain-permeable MBD2 pathway inhibitor suppresses MB growth in vivo. Altogether, our data define BAI1's physiological role in tumorigenesis and directly couple an ADGR to cancer formation.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms of selective autophagy of the ER, known as ER-phagy, require molecular delineation, particularly in vivo. It is unclear how these events control ER proteostasis and cellular health. Here, we identify cell-cycle progression gene 1 (CCPG1), an ER-resident protein with no known physiological role, as a non-canonical cargo receptor that directly binds to core autophagy proteins via an LIR motif to mammalian ATG8 proteins and, independently and via a discrete motif, to FIP200. These interactions facilitate ER-phagy. The CCPG1 gene is inducible by the unfolded protein response and thus directly links ER stress to ER-phagy. In vivo, CCPG1 protects against ER luminal protein aggregation and consequent unfolded protein response hyperactivation and tissue injury of the exocrine pancreas. Thus, via identification of this autophagy protein, we describe an unexpected molecular mechanism of ER-phagy and provide evidence that this may be physiologically relevant in ER luminal proteostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Whether and how regulation of genes and pathways contributes to physiological aging is topic of intense scientific debate. By performing an RNA expression-based screen for genes downregulated during aging of three different species, we identified glycine-C-acetyltransferase (GCAT, EC 2.3.1.29). Impairing gcat expression promotes the lifespan of C. elegans by interfering with threonine catabolism to promote methylglyoxal (MGO; CAS 78-98-8) formation in an amine oxidase-dependent manner. MGO is a reactive dicarbonyl inducing diabetic complications in mammals by causing oxidative stress and damaging cellular components, including proteins. While high concentrations of MGO consistently exert toxicity in nematodes, we unexpectedly find that low-dose MGO promotes lifespan, resembling key mediators of gcat impairment. These were executed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, namely PBS-3 and RPN-6.1 subunits, regulated by the stress-responsive transcriptional regulators SKN-1/NRF2 and HSF-1. Taken together, GCAT acts as an evolutionary conserved aging-related gene by orchestrating an unexpected nonlinear impact of proteotoxic MGO on longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular metabolism is a tightly controlled process in which the cell adapts fluxes through metabolic pathways in response to changes in nutrient supply. Among the transcription factors that regulate gene expression and thereby cause changes in cellular metabolism is the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα). Protein lysine acetylation is a key post-translational modification (PTM) that integrates cellular metabolic cues with other physiological processes. Here, we show that C/EBPα is acetylated by the lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) p300 and deacetylated by the lysine deacetylase (KDAC) sirtuin1 (SIRT1). SIRT1 is activated in times of energy demand by high levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and controls mitochondrial biogenesis and function. A hypoacetylated mutant of C/EBPα induces the transcription of mitochondrial genes and results in increased mitochondrial respiration. Our study identifies C/EBPα as a key mediator of SIRT1-controlled adaption of energy homeostasis to changes in nutrient supply.

Abstract: Multipotent neural stem cells could generate neurons and glial cells. Wide studies have been conducted to disclose the mechanism underlying neural stem cell differentiation and multiple factors have been identified in this field, one of which is bioactive components including natural herbal medicine. In this study, we found that magnesium lithospermate B is able to promote proliferation of neural stem cell in vitro. Besides, magnesium lithospermate B also induces generation of more neuronal cells and less glial cells. The in vivo studies indicates that magnesium lithospermate B enhances local neurogenesis since more Ki67+ and Thy1+ cells are observed in hippocampal region with injection of magnesium lithospermate B. Interestingly, enhancing proliferation and neurogenesis occurs in medial forebrain bundle of Parkinson’s Disease model and behavioral studies demonstrates that motor function is significantly improved in magnesium lithospermate B-treated disease models. Furthermore, we also found that effect of MLB on proliferation and differentiation of NSCs was mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling. Collectively, our study shows the important role of magnesium lithospermate B in neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, accordingly providing a simple and efficient method to induce the neuronal cell generation in neurodegenerative disease model.

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock and cell cycle as separate pathways have been well documented in plants. Elucidating whether these two oscillators are connected is critical for understanding plant growth. We found that a slow-running circadian clock decelerates the cell cycle and, conversely, a fast clock speeds it up. The clock component TOC1 safeguards the G1-to-S transition and controls the timing of the mitotic cycle at early stages of leaf development. TOC1 also regulates somatic ploidy at later stages of leaf development and in hypocotyl cells. The S-phase is shorter and delayed in TOC1 overexpressing plants, which correlates with the diurnal repression of the DNA replication licensing gene CDC6 through binding of TOC1 to the CDC6 promoter. The slow cell-cycle pace in TOC1-ox also results in delayed tumor progression in inflorescence stalks. Thus, TOC1 sets the time of the DNA pre-replicative machinery to control plant growth in resonance with the environment.

Abstract: Summary
Protein complexes are assemblies of subunits that have co-evolved to execute one or many coordinated functions in the cellular environment. Functional annotation of mammalian protein complexes is critical to understanding biological processes, as well as disease mechanisms. Here, we used genetic co-essentiality derived from genome-scale RNAi- and CRISPR-Cas9-based fitness screens performed across hundreds of human cancer cell lines to assign measures of functional similarity. From these measures, we systematically built and characterized functional similarity networks that recapitulate known structural and functional features of well-studied protein complexes and resolve novel functional modules within complexes lacking structural resolution, such as the mammalian SWI/SNF complex. Finally, by integrating functional networks with large protein-protein interaction networks, we discovered novel protein complexes involving recently evolved genes of unknown function. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of genetic perturbation screens alone, and in combination with large-scale biophysical data, to enhance our understanding of mammalian protein complexes in normal and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
A subgroup of biogenic amines, the so-called trace amines (TAs), are produced by mammals and bacteria and can act as neuromodulators. In the genus Staphylococcus, certain species are capable of producing TAs through the activity of staphylococcal aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (SadA). SadA decarboxylates aromatic amino acids to produce TAs, as well as dihydroxy phenylalanine and 5-hydroxytryptophan to thus produce the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. SadA-expressing staphylococci were prevalent in the gut of most probands, where they are part of the human intestinal microflora. Furthermore, sadA-expressing staphylococci showed increased adherence to HT-29 cells and 2- to 3-fold increased internalization. Internalization and adherence was also increased in a sadA mutant in the presence of tryptamine. The α2-adrenergic receptor is required for enhanced adherence and internalization. Thus, staphylococci in the gut might contribute to gut activity and intestinal colonization.

Abstract: Summary
Ciliopathies are a group of genetic disorders caused by a failure to form functional cilia. Due to a lack of structural information, it is currently poorly understood how ciliopathic mutations affect protein functionality to give rise to the underlying disease. Using X-ray crystallography, we show that the ciliopathy-associated centriolar protein CEP120 contains three C2 domains. The point mutations V194A and A199P, which cause Joubert syndrome (JS) and Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD), respectively, both reduce the thermostability of the second C2 domain by targeting residues that point toward its hydrophobic core. Genome-engineered cells homozygous for these mutations have largely normal centriole numbers but show reduced CEP120 levels, compromised recruitment of distal centriole markers, and deficient cilia formation. Our results provide insight into the disease mechanism of two ciliopathic mutations in CEP120, identify putative binding partners of CEP120 C2B, and suggest a complex genotype-phenotype relation of the CEP120 ciliopathy alleles.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic immunomodulation involving IL-1 has been investigated for unfavorable metabolic effects, including obesity, but a potentially favorable role for IL-1 remains unclear. Here, we find mechanistic interactions between working skeletal muscles and locally recruited neutrophils expressing IL-1β, which supports muscle performance through priming exercise-dependent GLUT4 translocation. Thus, during exercise, both IL-1α/β-deficient and neutrophil-depleted mice similarly exhibit increased fatigability associated with impaired muscle glucose homeostasis due to GLUT4 dysregulation. Deficiency of IL-1-producing neutrophils results in intrinsic abnormalities represented by aberrant Rac1 signaling and irregular GLUT4-storage vesicles, suggesting that these properties are maintained by local IL-1 produced by recruited neutrophils upon exercise, possibly on a daily basis. We propose that neutrophils are highly engaged in skeletal muscle performance via IL-1 regulation, which coordinates favorable inflammatory microenvironments supporting muscle glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Abemaciclib, an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), has recently been approved for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In this study, we use murine syngeneic tumor models and in vitro assays to investigate the impact of abemaciclib on T cells, the tumor immune microenvironment and the ability to combine with anti-PD-L1 blockade. Abemaciclib monotherapy resulted in tumor growth delay that was associated with an increased T cell inflammatory signature in tumors. Combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy led to complete tumor regressions and immunological memory, accompanied by enhanced antigen presentation, a T cell inflamed phenotype, and enhanced cell cycle control. In vitro, treatment with abemaciclib resulted in increased activation of human T cells and upregulated expression of antigen presentation genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These data collectively support the clinical investigation of the combination of abemaciclib with agents such as anti-PD-L1 that modulate T cell anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Extrinsic signals are implicated in breast cancer resistance to HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To examine how microenvironmental signals influence resistance, we monitored TKI-treated breast cancer cell lines grown on microenvironment microarrays composed of printed extracellular matrix proteins supplemented with soluble proteins. We tested ∼2,500 combinations of 56 soluble and 46 matrix microenvironmental proteins on basal-like HER2+ (HER2E) or luminal-like HER2+ (L-HER2+) cells treated with the TKIs lapatinib or neratinib. In HER2E cells, hepatocyte growth factor, a ligand for MET, induced resistance that could be reversed with crizotinib, an inhibitor of MET. In L-HER2+ cells, neuregulin1-β1 (NRG1β), a ligand for HER3, induced resistance that could be reversed with pertuzumab, an inhibitor of HER2-HER3 heterodimerization. The subtype-specific responses were also observed in 3D cultures and murine xenografts. These results, along with bioinformatic pathway analysis and siRNA knockdown experiments, suggest different mechanisms of resistance specific to each HER2+ subtype: MET signaling for HER2E and HER2-HER3 heterodimerization for L-HER2+ cells.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptosis culminates in the activation of caspase-3, which plays an important role in implementing the cell death program. Here, we reveal a non-apoptotic role of caspase-3 as a key regulator of cell proliferation and organ size. Caspase-3 is specifically activated in the proliferating cells of the sebaceous gland, but does not instruct cell elimination. Deletion or chemical inhibition of caspase-3 diminishes cell proliferation, decreases cell number and reduces sebaceous gland size in vivo. Exploring the underlying mechanism, we demonstrate that α-catenin is cleaved by caspase-3, thus facilitating the activation and nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP), a vital regulator of organ size. Accordingly, activation of caspase-3 leads to YAP-dependent organ size augmentation. Finally, we show that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) serves as an endogenous feedback antagonist for the caspase-3/YAP signaling module. Taken together, we report here a molecular mechanism wherein the apoptotic machinery is refocused to regulate cell proliferation and orchestrate organ size.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate the expression of thousands of transcripts, and some are reported to be involved in human tumorigenesis. However, little is known about the dysregulation of RBPs at the genomic level in human cancers. Here, we conducted comprehensive analyses for expression, somatic copy number alteration (SCNA), and mutation profiles of 1,542 RBPs in ∼7,000 clinical specimens across 15 cancer types. We identified markedly dysregulated RBPs and found that downregulation was a predominant pattern in cancer. Combined with recurrent SCNA data, we identified 76 RBPs as potential drivers. We also discovered a set of 139 RBPs that were significantly mutated in cancers. We confirmed the oncogenic property of six RBPs in colorectal and liver cancer cell lines by using in vitro functional experiments. Our study highlights the potential roles of RBPs in carcinogenesis and lays the groundwork to better understand the functions and mechanisms of RBPs in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
We characterized the epigenetic landscape of genes encoding long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) across 6,475 tumors and 455 cancer cell lines. In stark contrast to the CpG island hypermethylation phenotype in cancer, we observed a recurrent hypomethylation of 1,006 lncRNA genes in cancer, including EPIC1 (epigenetically-induced lncRNA1). Overexpression of EPIC1 is associated with poor prognosis in luminal B breast cancer patients and enhances tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, EPIC1 promotes cell-cycle progression by interacting with MYC through EPIC1's 129–283 nt region. EPIC1 knockdown reduces the occupancy of MYC to its target genes (e.g., CDKN1A, CCNA2, CDC20, and CDC45). MYC depletion abolishes EPIC1's regulation of MYC target and luminal breast cancer tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone controlling responses to abiotic stresses and is sensed by proteins from the PYR/PYL/RCAR family. To explore the genetic contribution of PYLs toward ABA-dependent and ABA-independent processes, we generated and characterized high-order Arabidopsis mutants with mutations in the PYL family. We obtained a pyl quattuordecuple mutant and found that it was severely impaired in growth and failed to produce seeds. Thus, we carried out a detailed characterization of a pyl duodecuple mutant, pyr1pyl1/2/3/4/5/7/8/9/10/11/12. The duodecuple mutant was extremely insensitive to ABA effects on seed germination, seedling growth, stomatal closure, leaf senescence, and gene expression. The activation of SnRK2 protein kinases by ABA was blocked in the duodecuple mutant, but, unexpectedly, osmotic stress activation of SnRK2s was enhanced. Our results demonstrate an important role of basal ABA signaling in growth, senescence, and abscission and reveal that PYLs antagonize ABA-independent activation of SnRK2s by osmotic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy (autophagy) is intimately linked with cell death and allows cells to evade apoptosis. This has prompted clinical trials to combine autophagy inhibitors with other drugs with the aim of increasing the likelihood of cancer cells dying. However, the molecular basis for such effects is unknown. Here, we describe a transcriptional mechanism that connects autophagy to apoptosis. The autophagy-regulating transcription factor, FOXO3a, is itself turned over by basal autophagy creating a potential feedback loop. Increased FOXO3a upon autophagy inhibition stimulates transcription of the pro-apoptotic BBC3/PUMA gene to cause apoptosis sensitization. This mechanism explains how autophagy inhibition can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy drugs and allows an autophagy inhibitor to change the action of an MDM2-targeted drug from growth inhibition to apoptosis, reducing tumor burden in vivo. Thus, a link between two processes mediated via a single transcription factor binding site in the genome can be leveraged to improve anti-cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Serine ADP-ribosylation (Ser-ADPr) is a recently discovered protein modification that is catalyzed by PARP1 and PARP2 when in complex with the eponymous histone PARylation factor 1 (HPF1). In addition to numerous other targets, core histone tails are primary acceptors of Ser-ADPr in the DNA damage response. Here, we show that specific canonical histone marks interfere with Ser-ADPr of neighboring residues and vice versa. Most notably, acetylation, but not methylation of H3K9, is mutually exclusive with ADPr of H3S10 in vitro and in vivo. We also broaden the O-linked ADPr spectrum by providing evidence for tyrosine ADPr on HPF1 and other proteins. Finally, we facilitate wider investigations into the interplay of histone marks with Ser-ADPr by introducing a simple approach for profiling posttranslationally modified peptides. Our findings implicate Ser-ADPr as a dynamic addition to the complex interplay of modifications that shape the histone code.

Abstract: The guppy is a tropical fish that has been used as an experimental model organism in science. It is a species well adapted to the natural environment and that can support adverse environmental conditions, and so, at occasions, its presence can be indicative of environmental disturbances. Moreover, as the liver is very important when studying fish diseases, the knowledge of normal microanatomy is essential to assess histological changes, e.g., related to environmental change or toxic pollutants. The target organ of this histological study is the liver. The main objective is to contribute to the identification of anatomical and structural variations of this organ in different teleost species. We studied the distribution and spatial organization of the different types of blood vessels and biliary ducts and the relationships between them are established. For this, each liver was totally sectioned and the serial sections inspected in detail. The guppy liver presented intra-hepatic pancreatic tissue and so reported its association with the vascular and biliary elements. We observed that the input of afferent vessels (i.e., bringing blood into the liver) occur not only in the hilum but pierce and enter the organ at various points. Within the liver, venous vessels and bile ducts are seen, isolated or associated as venous–arteriolar tracts (VAT), and venous-biliary- arteriolar tracts (VBAT). Sometimes, pancreocytes appear within the liver surrounding isolated veins, forming venous tract with pancreatic acini (VT-P), or dual associations with afferent vessels, forming venous–arteriolar tracts with pancreatic acini (VAT-P). Intrahepatic pancreatic ducts were tiny and rare, putting in question the functional role of the acini. Contrary to other fish species, we did not spot isolated arterioles and associations between these and biliary ducts (BAT).We found aggregates of macrophages, namely associated with afferent and efferent (i.e., draining blood out) venous vessels; the latter fact not commonly reported in other fish species. There was a reduced arterialization of the organ (as arterioles were extremely rare), contrasting with an over predominance of a random distribution of the venous vascularization. The guppy differs to some extent from other previously studied models, highlighting the importance of making this kind of study to offer specific frameworks that can explain specific physiological processes or avoid misinterpretations; for instance about gene expression, as the whole liver specific expression will reflect the presence of hepatocytes and pancreocytes as well.

Abstract: Summary
ETV6-RUNX1 is associated with childhood acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) functioning as a first-hit mutation that initiates a clinically silent pre-leukemia in utero. Because lineage commitment hierarchies differ between embryo and adult, and the impact of oncogenes is cell-context dependent, we hypothesized that the childhood affiliation of ETV6-RUNX1 cALL reflects its origins in a progenitor unique to embryonic life. We characterize the first emerging B cells in first-trimester human embryos, identifying a developmentally restricted CD19−IL-7R+ progenitor compartment, which transitions from a myeloid to lymphoid program during ontogeny. This developmental series is recapitulated in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), thereby providing a model for the initiation of cALL. Genome-engineered hPSCs expressing ETV6-RUNX1 from the endogenous ETV6 locus show expansion of the CD19−IL-7R+ compartment, show a partial block in B lineage commitment, and produce proB cells with aberrant myeloid gene expression signatures and potential: features (collectively) consistent with a pre-leukemic state.

Abstract: Today, regenerative medicine requires new sources of multipotent stem cells for their differentiation to chondrocytes using the mediums of differentiation available in the market. This study aimed to determine whether the Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) isolated from Mobilized Peripheral Blood (MPB) in sheep using the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), have the ability of first acquire a fibroblast-like morphology after being forced out of the bone marrow niche by G-CSF and second, if the cells have the capacity to express collagen type-II α I in primary culture using a human commercial media of differentiation. Six Suffolk male sheep with age of 2 years were mobilized using G-CSF. One subcutaneous injection of 10 mcg per kilogram of bodyweight were administered every 24 h during three consecutive days. At day four, a sample of 20 mL of peripheral blood was harvested, afterwards, monocytes cells were separated by ficoll gradient. The mobilized MSCs were expanded in primary culture in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% adult sheep serum for three weeks and characterized by an antibody panel for surface markers: CD105, CD90, CD73, CD34, and CD45, before and after primary culture. Subsequently, an aliquot of cells in the first pass were cultured in a commercial human chondrogenic medium for three weeks. As a result, the percentage of surface markers for MSCs (CD105, CD90, CD73) in expanded cells in primary culture significantly increased, at the same time a decrease in the markers for hematopoietic cells (CD34 and CD45) was observed and the cells morphology was fibroblast-like. After three weeks of differentiation culture, the immunofluorescence analysis evidenced the expression of collagen-type-II. It was concluded that Mesenchymal Stem Cells isolated from mobilized peripheral blood in sheep have the ability to pre-differentiate into chondral like cells and express collagen type-II when are stimulated with a human commercial chondrogenic medium in monolayer culture.

Abstract: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit H (EIF3H) is required for the progression of several types of cancer. However, little is known about the function of EIF3H in gastric carcinoma. To address this issue, in the present study, we investigated EIF3H genetic alterations in and expression of EIF3H in gastric cancer tissue samples using cBioPortal and Oncomine databases. Endogenous EIF3H expression was knocked down in MGC80-3 and AGS gastric cancer cell lines by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference. We confirmed the knockdown efficiency by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting and evaluated the effects of EIF3H silencing on cell proliferation of gastric cancer with the cell viability and colony formation assays and by flow cytometry. The OncoPrint of EIF3H generated using cBioPortal indicated that EIF3H genetic alterations (mutation, deletion and amplification) were present in two gastric cancer sample sets. The Oncomine analysis revealed that EIF3H mRNA level was upregulated in gastric cancer tissues. EIF3H knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in gastric cancer lines and led to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, while inducing apoptosis via up- and downregulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, respectively. These results indicate that EIF3H can serve as a novel therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal cord longitudinal axons comprise some of the longest axons in our body. However, mechanisms that drive this extra long-distance axonal growth are largely unclear. We found that ascending axons of rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors closely abut a previously undescribed population of roof plate-derived radial glial-like cells (RGLCs) in the spinal cord dorsal column, which form a network of processes enriched with growth-promoting factors. In dreher mutant mice that lack RGLCs, the lengths of ascending RA mechanoreceptor axon branches are specifically reduced, whereas their descending and collateral branches, and other dorsal column and sensory pathways, are largely unaffected. Because the number and intrinsic growth ability of RA mechanoreceptors are normal in dreher mice, our data suggest that RGLCs provide critical non-cell autonomous growth support for the ascending axons of RA mechanoreceptors. Together, our work identifies a developmental mechanism specifically required for long-range spinal cord longitudinal axons.

Abstract: Summary
Recent identification of a mammary gland-specific microbiome led to studies investigating bacteria populations in breast cancer. Malignant breast tumors have lower Lactobacillus abundance compared with benign lesions, implicating Lactobacillus as a negative regulator of breast cancer. Diet is a main determinant of gut microbial diversity. Whether diet affects breast microbiome populations is unknown. In a non-human primate model, we found that consumption of a Western or Mediterranean diet modulated mammary gland microbiota and metabolite profiles. Mediterranean diet consumption led to increased mammary gland Lactobacillus abundance compared with Western diet-fed monkeys. Moreover, mammary glands from Mediterranean diet-fed monkeys had higher levels of bile acid metabolites and increased bacterial-processed bioactive compounds. These data suggest that diet directly influences microbiome populations outside the intestinal tract in distal sites such as the mammary gland. Our study demonstrates that diet affects the mammary gland microbiome, establishing an alternative mechanistic pathway for breast cancer prevention.

Abstract: Summary
As sessile organisms, plants must adapt to variations in the environment. Environmental stress triggers various responses, including growth inhibition, mediated by the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). The mechanisms that integrate stress responses with growth are poorly understood. Here, we discovered that the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase phosphorylates PYL ABA receptors at a conserved serine residue to prevent activation of the stress response in unstressed plants. This phosphorylation disrupts PYL association with ABA and with PP2C phosphatase effectors, leading to inactivation of SnRK2 kinases. Under stress, ABA-activated SnRK2s phosphorylate Raptor, a component of the TOR complex, triggering TOR complex dissociation and inhibition. Thus, TOR signaling represses ABA signaling and stress responses in unstressed conditions, whereas ABA signaling represses TOR signaling and growth during times of stress. Plants utilize this conserved phospho-regulatory feedback mechanism to optimize the balance of growth and stress responses.

Abstract: Summary
We studied 137 primary testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) using high-dimensional assays of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic features. These tumors exhibited high aneuploidy and a paucity of somatic mutations. Somatic mutation of only three genes achieved significance—KIT, KRAS, and NRAS—exclusively in samples with seminoma components. Integrated analyses identified distinct molecular patterns that characterized the major recognized histologic subtypes of TGCT: seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. Striking differences in global DNA methylation and microRNA expression between histology subtypes highlight a likely role of epigenomic processes in determining histologic fates in TGCTs. We also identified a subset of pure seminomas defined by KIT mutations, increased immune infiltration, globally demethylated DNA, and decreased KRAS copy number. We report potential biomarkers for risk stratification, such as miRNA specifically expressed in teratoma, and others with molecular diagnostic potential, such as CpH (CpA/CpC/CpT) methylation identifying embryonal carcinomas.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived T cells may provide future therapies for cancer patients, but those generated by current methods, such as the OP9/DLL1 system, have shown abnormalities that pose major barriers for clinical translation. Our data indicate that these iPSC-derived CD8 single-positive T cells are more like CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells than mature naive T cells because they display phenotypic markers of developmental arrest and an innate-like phenotype after stimulation. We developed a 3D thymic culture system to avoid these aberrant developmental fates, generating a homogeneous subset of CD8αβ+ antigen-specific T cells, designated iPSC-derived thymic emigrants (iTEs). iTEs exhibit phenotypic and functional similarities to naive T cells both in vitro and in vivo, including the capacity for expansion, memory formation, and tumor suppression. These data illustrate the limitations of current methods and provide a tool to develop the next generation of iPSC-based antigen-specific immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
We present an integromic analysis of gene alterations that modulate transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-Smad-mediated signaling in 9,125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Focusing on genes that encode mediators and regulators of TGF-β signaling, we found at least one genomic alteration (mutation, homozygous deletion, or amplification) in 39% of samples, with highest frequencies in gastrointestinal cancers. We identified mutation hotspots in genes that encode TGF-β ligands (BMP5), receptors (TGFBR2, AVCR2A, and BMPR2), and Smads (SMAD2 and SMAD4). Alterations in the TGF-β superfamily correlated positively with expression of metastasis-associated genes and with decreased survival. Correlation analyses showed the contributions of mutation, amplification, deletion, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression to transcriptional activity of TGF-β signaling in each cancer type. This study provides a broad molecular perspective relevant for future functional and therapeutic studies of the diverse cancer pathways mediated by the TGF-β superfamily.

Abstract: Summary
Stress exposure is associated with the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Here, we show in rodents that chronic stress exposure rapidly and transiently elevates hippocampal expression of Kruppel-like factor 9 (Klf9). Inducible genetic silencing of Klf9 expression in excitatory forebrain neurons in adulthood prior to, but not after, onset of stressor prevented chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced potentiation of contextual fear acquisition in female mice and chronic corticosterone (CORT) exposure-induced fear generalization in male mice. Klf9 silencing prevented chronic CORT and CRS induced enlargement of dendritic spines in the ventral hippocampus of male and female mice, respectively. KLF9 mRNA density was increased in the anterior dentate gyrus of women, but not men, with more severe recent stressful life events and increased mortality. Thus, Klf9 functions as a stress-responsive transcription factor that mediates circuit and behavioral resilience in a sex-specific manner.

A Novel Tetrameric Assembly Configuration in VV2_1132, a LysR-Type Transcriptional Regulator in Vibrio vulnificus,

Abstract: LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) contain an N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD). Typically, LTTRs function as homotetramers. VV2_1132 was identified in Vibrio vulnificus as an LTTR that is a homologue of HypT (also known as YjiE or QseD) in Escherichia coli. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of full-length VV2_1132 at a resolution of 2.2 Å, thereby revealing a novel combination of the domains in the tetrameric assembly. Only one DBD dimer in the tetramer can bind to DNA, because the DNA binding motifs of the other DBD dimer are completely buried in the tetrameric assembly. Structural and functional analyses of VV2_1132 suggest that it might not perform the same role as E. coli HypT, indicating that further study is required to elucidate the function of this gene in V. vulnificus. The unique structure of VV2_1132 extends our knowledge of LTTR function and mechanisms of action.

The Autism-Related Protein CHD8 Cooperates with C/EBPβ to Regulate Adipogenesis,

Abstract: Summary
The gene encoding the chromatin remodeler CHD8 is the most frequently mutated gene in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Heterozygous mutations in CHD8 give rise to ASD that is often accompanied by macrocephaly, gastrointestinal complaints, and slender habitus. Whereas most phenotypes of CHD8 haploinsufficiency likely result from delayed neurodevelopment, the mechanism underlying slender habitus has remained unknown. Here, we show that CHD8 interacts with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) and promotes its transactivation activity during adipocyte differentiation. Adipogenesis was impaired in Chd8-deleted preadipocytes, with the upregulation of C/EBPα and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), two master regulators of this process, being attenuated in mutant cells. Furthermore, mice with CHD8 ablation in white preadipocytes had a markedly reduced white adipose tissue mass. Our findings reveal a mode of C/EBPβ regulation by CHD8 during adipogenesis, with CHD8 deficiency resulting in a defect in the development of white adipose tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Cysteine cathepsins play roles during development and disease beyond their function in lysosomal protein turnover. Here, we leverage a fluorescent activity-based probe (ABP), BMV109, to track cysteine cathepsins in normal and diseased zebrafish embryos. Using this probe in a model of mucolipidosis II, we show that loss of carbohydrate-dependent lysosomal sorting alters the activity of several cathepsin proteases. The data support a pathogenic mechanism where TGF-ß signals enhance the proteolytic processing of pro-Ctsk by modulating the expression of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S). In MLII, elevated C4-S corresponds with TGF-ß-mediated increases in chst11 expression. Inhibiting chst11 impairs the proteolytic activation of Ctsk and alleviates the MLII phenotypes. These findings uncover a regulatory loop between TGF-ß signaling and Ctsk activation that is altered in the context of lysosomal disease. This work highlights the power of ABPs to identify mechanisms underlying pathogenic development in living animals.

Abstract: Summary
Although the MYC oncogene has been implicated in cancer, a systematic assessment of alterations of MYC, related transcription factors, and co-regulatory proteins, forming the proximal MYC network (PMN), across human cancers is lacking. Using computational approaches, we define genomic and proteomic features associated with MYC and the PMN across the 33 cancers of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Pan-cancer, 28% of all samples had at least one of the MYC paralogs amplified. In contrast, the MYC antagonists MGA and MNT were the most frequently mutated or deleted members, proposing a role as tumor suppressors. MYC alterations were mutually exclusive with PIK3CA, PTEN, APC, or BRAF alterations, suggesting that MYC is a distinct oncogenic driver. Expression analysis revealed MYC-associated pathways in tumor subtypes, such as immune response and growth factor signaling; chromatin, translation, and DNA replication/repair were conserved pan-cancer. This analysis reveals insights into MYC biology and is a reference for biomarkers and therapeutics for cancers with alterations of MYC or the PMN.

Abstract: Summary
How intracellular pathogens acquire essential non-diffusible host metabolites and whether the host cell counteracts the siphoning of these nutrients by its invaders are open questions. Here we show that host mitochondria fuse during infection by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii to limit its uptake of fatty acids (FAs). A combination of genetics and imaging of FA trafficking indicates that Toxoplasma infection triggers lipophagy, the autophagy of host lipid droplets (LDs), to secure cellular FAs essential for its proliferation. Indeed, Toxoplasma FA siphoning and growth are reduced in host cells genetically deficient for autophagy or triglyceride depots. Conversely, Toxoplasma FA uptake and proliferation are increased in host cells lacking mitochondrial fusion, required for efficient mitochondrial FA oxidation, or where mitochondrial FA oxidation is pharmacologically inhibited. Thus, mitochondrial fusion can be regarded as a cellular defense mechanism against intracellular parasites, by limiting Toxoplasma access to host nutrients liberated by lipophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Recent progress in direct lineage reprogramming has enabled the generation of induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells and revealed their potential as an alternative to hepatocytes for medical applications. However, the hepatic functions of iHep cells are insufficient compared with those of primary hepatocytes. Here, we show that cell-aggregate formation can rapidly induce growth arrest and hepatic maturation of iHep cells through activation of Hippo signaling. During formation of iHep cell aggregates, Yap inactivation is induced by actin reorganization and intercellular adhesion, leading to upregulation of Hnf1α expression in the absence of the Yap/Tead/Chd4 transcriptional repressor unit. Hnf1α then acts as a central transcription factor that regulates liver-enriched gene expression in iHep cell aggregates and induces functional differentiation of iHep cells. Moreover, iHep cell aggregates efficiently reconstitute injured liver tissues and support hepatic function after transplantation. Thus, iHep cell aggregates may provide insights into basic research and potential therapies for liver diseases.

Abstract: Background
Intestinal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) induces oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and acute lung injury. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a nitric oxide donor, has been documented to have protective effects on experimental ischemia models.
Aim
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of GSNO on I/R-induced intestine and lung damage and detect the potential mechanisms emphasizing the protective role of GSNO.
Methods
Intestinal I/R was induced by occluding the superior mesenteric artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 180 min. GSNO was administered intravenously before reperfusion period (0.25 mg/kg). The levels of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, and myeloperoxidase (MPO), histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical expressions of both nuclear factor KappaB (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) in intestine and lung tissues were assessed.
Results
Histolopathologic evaluation demonstrated that intestinal I/R induced severe damages in the intestine and the lung tissues. Histopathological scores decreased with GSNO treatment. GSNO treatment reduced lipid peroxidation and MPO levels and inhibited expression of NF-κB and iNOS in the intestine.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that GSNO treatment may ameliorate the intestinal and lung injury in rats, at least in part, by inhibiting inflammatory response and oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Oocyte quality control culls eggs with defects in meiosis. In mouse, oocyte death can be triggered by defects in chromosome synapsis and recombination, which involve repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) between homologous chromosomes. We show that RNF212, a SUMO ligase required for crossing over, also mediates oocyte quality control. Both physiological apoptosis and wholesale oocyte elimination in meiotic mutants require RNF212. RNF212 sensitizes oocytes to DSB-induced apoptosis within a narrow window as chromosomes desynapse and cells transition into quiescence. Analysis of DNA damage during this transition implies that RNF212 impedes DSB repair. Consistently, RNF212 is required for HORMAD1, a negative regulator of inter-sister recombination, to associate with desynapsing chromosomes. We infer that oocytes impede repair of residual DSBs to retain a “memory” of meiotic defects that enables quality-control processes. These results define the logic of oocyte quality control and suggest RNF212 variants may influence transmission of defective genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Newborn neurons follow molecular cues to reach their final destination, but whether early life experience influences lamination remains largely unexplored. As light is among the first stimuli to reach the developing nervous system via intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), we asked whether ipRGCs could affect lamination in the developing mouse retina. We show here that ablation of ipRGCs causes cone photoreceptors to mislocalize at different apicobasal positions in the retina. This effect is partly mediated by light-evoked activity in ipRGCs, as dark rearing or silencing of ipRGCs leads a subset of cones to mislocalize. Furthermore, ablation of ipRGCs alters the cone transcriptome and decreases expression of the dopamine receptor D4, while injection of L-DOPA or D4 receptor agonist rescues the displaced cone phenotype observed in dark-reared animals. These results show that early light-mediated activity in ipRGCs influences neuronal lamination and identify ipRGC-elicited dopamine release as a mechanism influencing cone position.

Abstract: Spontaneous neuronal activity and concomitant intracellular Ca2+ signaling are abundant during early perinatal development and are well known for their key role in neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation and wiring. However, much less is known about the in vivo patterns of spontaneous Ca2+ signaling in immature adult-born cells. Here, by using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we analyzed spontaneous in vivo Ca2+ signaling in adult-born juxtaglomerular cells of the mouse olfactory bulb over the time period of 5 weeks, from the day of their arrival in the glomerular layer till their stable integration into the preexisting neural network. We show that spontaneous Ca2+ transients are ubiquitously present in adult-born cells right after their arrival, require activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels and are little sensitive to isoflurane anesthesia. Interestingly, several parameters of this spontaneous activity, such as the area under the curve, the time spent in the active state as well as the fraction of continuously active cells show a bell-shaped dependence on cell’s age, all peaking in 3–4 weeks old cells. This data firmly document the in vivo presence of spontaneous Ca2+ signaling during the layer-specific maturation of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb and motivate further analyses of the functional role(s) of this activity.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated relationships among immune, metabolic, and sleep abnormalities in mice with non-metastatic mammary cancer. Tumor-bearing mice displayed interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated peripheral inflammation, coincident with altered hepatic glucose processing and sleep. Tumor-bearing mice were hyperphagic, had reduced serum leptin concentrations, and enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ghrelin. We tested whether these phenotypes were driven by inflammation using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6; despite the reduction in IL-6 signaling, metabolic and sleep abnormalities persisted. We next investigated neural populations coupling metabolism and sleep, and observed altered activity within lateral-hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (HO) neurons. We used a dual HO-receptor antagonist to test whether increased HO signaling was causing metabolic abnormalities. This approach rescued metabolic abnormalities and enhanced sleep quality in tumor-bearing mice. Peripheral sympathetic denervation prevented tumor-induced increases in serum glucose. Our results link metabolic and sleep abnormalities via the HO system, and provide evidence that central neuromodulators contribute to tumor-induced changes in metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, uses antigenic variation as a strategy to evade the host’s acquired immune response. New variants of surface-localized VlsE are generated efficiently by unidirectional recombination from 15 unexpressed vls cassettes into the vlsE locus. Using algorithms to analyze switching from vlsE sequencing data, we characterize a population of over 45,000 inferred recombination events generated during mouse infection. We present evidence for clustering of these recombination events within the population and along the vlsE gene, a role for the direct repeats flanking the variable region in vlsE, and the importance of sequence homology in determining the location of recombination, despite RecA’s dispensability. Finally, we report that non-templated sequence variation is strongly associated with recombinational switching and occurs predominantly at the 5′ end of conversion tracts. This likely results from an error-prone repair mechanism operational during recombinational switching that elevates the mutation rate > 5,000-fold in switched regions.

Abstract: The spatial organisation of Orai channels and SERCA pumps within ER-PM junctions is important for enhancing the versatility and specificity of sub-cellular Ca2+ signals generated during store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). In this paper, we present a novel three dimensional spatio-temporal model describing Ca2+ dynamics in the ER-PM junction and sub-PM ER during SOCE. We investigate the role of Orai channel and SERCA pump location to provide insights into how these components shape the Ca2+ signals generated and affect ER refilling. We find that the organisation of Orai channels within the ER-PM junction controls the amplitude and shape of the Ca2+ profile but does not enhance ER refilling. The model shows that ER refilling is only weakly affected by the location of SERCA2b pumps within the ER-PM junction and that the placement of SERCA2a pumps within the ER-PM junction has much greater control over ER refilling.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms that control human cardiomyocyte proliferation might be applicable to regenerative medicine. We screened a whole genome collection of human miRNAs, identifying 96 to be capable of increasing proliferation (DNA synthesis and cytokinesis) of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Chemical screening and computational approaches indicated that most of these miRNAs (67) target different components of the Hippo pathway and that their activity depends on the nuclear translocation of the Hippo transcriptional effector YAP. 53 of the 67 miRNAs are present in human iPSC cardiomyocytes, yet anti-miRNA screening revealed that none are individually essential for basal proliferation of hiPSC cardiomyocytes despite the importance of YAP for proliferation. We propose a model in which multiple endogenous miRNAs redundantly suppress Hippo signaling to sustain the cell cycle of immature cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Summary
During decision making, hippocampal activity encodes information sometimes about present and sometimes about potential future plans. The mechanisms underlying this transition remain unknown. Building on the evidence that gamma oscillations at different frequencies (low gamma [LG], 30–55 Hz; high gamma [HG], 60–90 Hz; and epsilon, 100–140 Hz) reflect inputs from different circuits, we identified how changes in those frequencies reflect different information-processing states. Using a unique noradrenergic manipulation by clonidine, which shifted both neural representations and gamma states, we found that future representations depended on gamma components. These changes were identifiable on each cycle of theta as asymmetries in the theta cycle, which arose from changes within the ratio of LG and HG power and the underlying phases of those gamma rhythms within the theta cycle. These changes in asymmetry of the theta cycle reflected changes in representations of present and future on each theta cycle.

Abstract: Human fallopian tube fimbria secretory epithelial cells (hFTSECs) are considered an origin of ovarian cancer and methods for their culture from fallopian tube specimens have been reported. Our objective was to determine whether characteristics of the donors or surgeries were associated with the capacities of fimbria specimens to generate hFTSEC cultures or their immune profiles. There were no surgical complications attributable to fallopian tube removal. Attempts to establish primary hFTSEC cultures were successful in 37 of 55 specimens (67%). Success rates did not differ significantly between specimens grouped by patient or surgery characteristics. Established cultures could be revived after cryopreservation and none became contaminated with microorganisms. Two cultures evaluated for long term growth senesced between passages 10 and 15. M1 macrophages were the predominant cell type, while all other immune cells were present at much lower percentages. IL-10 and TGF-β exhibited opposing trends with M1 and M2 macrophages. Plasma IL-10 levels exhibited significant positive correlation with patient age. In conclusion, fallopian tube fimbria specimens exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype and can be used to provide a source of hFTSECs that can be cultured for a limited time regardless of the donor patient age or race, or the type of surgery performed.

Abstract: Summary
With the use of a mouse model expressing human Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs), we demonstrated that antibodies with isotypes equivalent to ipilimumab and tremelimumab mediate intra-tumoral regulatory T (Treg) cell depletion in vivo, increasing the CD8+ to Treg cell ratio and promoting tumor rejection. Antibodies with improved FcγR binding profiles drove superior anti-tumor responses and survival. In patients with advanced melanoma, response to ipilimumab was associated with the CD16a-V158F high affinity polymorphism. Such activity only appeared relevant in the context of inflamed tumors, explaining the modest response rates observed in the clinical setting. Our data suggest that the activity of anti-CTLA-4 in inflamed tumors may be improved through enhancement of FcγR binding, whereas poorly infiltrated tumors will likely require combination approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens pose an urgent healthcare threat, prompting a demand for new medicines. We report the mode of action of the natural ansamycin antibiotic kanglemycin A (KglA). KglA binds bacterial RNA polymerase at the rifampicin-binding pocket but maintains potency against RNA polymerases containing rifampicin-resistant mutations. KglA has antibiotic activity against rifampicin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-M. tuberculosis). The X-ray crystal structures of KglA with the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme and Thermus thermophilus RNA polymerase-promoter complex reveal an altered—compared with rifampicin—conformation of KglA within the rifampicin-binding pocket. Unique deoxysugar and succinate ansa bridge substituents make additional contacts with a separate, hydrophobic pocket of RNA polymerase and preclude the formation of initial dinucleotides, respectively. Previous ansa-chain modifications in the rifamycin series have proven unsuccessful. Thus, KglA represents a key starting point for the development of a new class of ansa-chain derivatized ansamycins to tackle rifampicin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA polymerase II-associated protein 1 (RPAP1) is conserved across metazoa and required for stem cell differentiation in plants; however, very little is known about its mechanism of action or its role in mammalian cells. Here, we report that RPAP1 is essential for the expression of cell identity genes and for cell viability. Depletion of RPAP1 triggers cell de-differentiation, facilitates reprogramming toward pluripotency, and impairs differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that RPAP1 is essential for the interaction between RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and Mediator, as well as for the recruitment of important regulators, such as the Mediator-specific RNA Pol II factor Gdown1 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase RPAP2. In agreement, depletion of RPAP1 diminishes the loading of total and Ser5-phosphorylated RNA Pol II on many genes, with super-enhancer-driven genes among the most significantly downregulated. We conclude that Mediator/RPAP1/RNA Pol II is an ancient module, conserved from plants to mammals, critical for establishing and maintaining cell identity.

Abstract: Summary
Patterning of vertebrate melanophores is essential for mate selection and protection from UV-induced damage. Patterning can be influenced by circulating long-range factors, such as hormones, but it is unclear how their activity is controlled in recipient cells to prevent excesses in cell number and migration. The zebrafish wanderlust mutant harbors a mutation in the sheddase bace2 and exhibits hyperdendritic and hyperproliferative melanophores that localize to aberrant sites. We performed a chemical screen to identify suppressors of the wanderlust phenotype and found that inhibition of insulin/PI3Kγ/mTOR signaling rescues the defect. In normal physiology, Bace2 cleaves the insulin receptor, whereas its loss results in hyperactive insulin/PI3K/mTOR signaling. Insulin B, an isoform enriched in the head, drives the melanophore defect. These results suggest that insulin signaling is negatively regulated by melanophore-specific expression of a sheddase, highlighting how long-distance factors can be regulated in a cell-type-specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans is implicated in intestinal diseases. Identifying host signatures that discriminate between the pathogenic versus commensal nature of this human commensal is clinically relevant. In the present study, we identify IL-9 and mast cells (MCs) as key players of Candida commensalism and pathogenicity. By inducing TGF-β in stromal MCs, IL-9 pivotally contributes to mucosal immune tolerance via the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme. However, Candida-driven IL-9 and mucosal MCs also contribute to barrier function loss, dissemination, and inflammation in experimental leaky gut models and are upregulated in patients with celiac disease. Inflammatory dysbiosis occurs with IL-9 and MC deficiency, indicating that the activity of IL-9 and MCs may go beyond host immunity to include regulation of the microbiota. Thus, the output of the IL-9/MC axis is highly contextual during Candida colonization and reveals how host immunity and the microbiota finely tune Candida behavior in the gut.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about how variation in sequence composition alters transcription factor occupancy to precisely recruit large transcription complexes. A key model for understanding how transcription complexes are targeted is the Drosophila dosage compensation system in which the male-specific lethal (MSL) transcription complex specifically identifies and regulates the male X chromosome. The chromatin-linked adaptor for MSL proteins (CLAMP) zinc-finger protein targets MSL to the X chromosome but also binds to GA-rich sequence elements throughout the genome. Furthermore, the GAGA-associated factor (GAF) transcription factor also recognizes GA-rich sequences but does not associate with the MSL complex. Here, we demonstrate that MSL complex recruitment sites are optimal CLAMP targets. Specificity for CLAMP binding versus GAF binding is driven by variability in sequence composition within similar GA-rich motifs. Therefore, variation within seemingly similar cis elements drives the context-specific targeting of a large transcription complex.

Abstract: Summary
Human high-affinity antibodies to pathogens often recognize unrelated ligands. The molecular origin and the role of this polyreactivity are largely unknown. Here, we report that HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are frequently polyreactive, cross-reacting with non-HIV-1 molecules, including self-antigens. Mutating bNAb genes to increase HIV-1 binding and neutralization also results in de novo polyreactivity. Unliganded paratopes of polyreactive bNAbs with improved HIV-1 neutralization exhibit a conformational flexibility, which contributes to enhanced affinity of bNAbs to various HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins and non-HIV antigens. Binding adaptation of polyreactive bNAbs to the divergent ligands mainly involves hydrophophic interactions. Plasticity of bNAbs’ paratopes may, therefore, facilitate accommodating divergent viral variants, but it simultaneously triggers promiscuous binding to non-HIV-1 antigens. Thus, a certain level of polyreactivity can be a mark of adaptable antibodies displaying optimal pathogens’ recognition.

Abstract: Summary
LIN28 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the maturation of the let-7 family of microRNAs by bipartite interactions with let-7 precursors through its two distinct cold shock and zinc-knuckle domains. Through inhibition of let-7 biogenesis, LIN28 functions as a pluripotency factor, as well as a driver of tumorigenesis. Here, we report a fluorescence polarization assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors for both domains of LIN28 involved in let-7 interactions. Of 101,017 compounds screened, six inhibit LIN28:let-7 binding and impair LIN28-mediated let-7 oligouridylation. Upon further characterization, we demonstrate that the LIN28 inhibitor TPEN destabilizes the zinc-knuckle domain of LIN28, while LI71 binds the cold shock domain to suppress LIN28’s activity against let-7 in leukemia cells and embryonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate selective pharmacologic inhibition of individual domains of LIN28 and provide a foundation for therapeutic inhibition of the let-7 biogenesis pathway in LIN28-driven diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is more common in western countries with diet being a potential contributing factor. Here we show that intermittent fasting (IF) ameliorated clinical course and pathology of the MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). IF led to increased gut bacteria richness, enrichment of the Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Prevotellaceae families and enhanced antioxidative microbial metabolic pathways. IF altered T cells in the gut with a reduction of IL-17 producing T cells and an increase in regulatory T cells. Fecal microbiome transplantation from mice on IF ameliorated EAE in immunized recipient mice on a normal diet, suggesting that IF effects are at least partially mediated by the gut flora. In a pilot clinical trial in MS patients, intermittent energy restriction altered blood adipokines and the gut flora resembling protective changes observed in mice. In conclusion, IF has potent immunomodulatory effects that are at least partially mediated by the gut microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
Picornaviruses have evolved to hijack host cellular machinery, including the autophagic pathway. However, the mechanisms remain largely unclear. We use coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) as a model organism to explore the possible role of picornavirus subversion of the autophagic pathway in viral infection. Our in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that CVB3 infection causes a significant, albeit incomplete, inhibition of autophagic flux by limiting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and/or late endosomes. Furthermore, we show that CVB3 specifically targets SNARE protein SNAP29 and adaptor protein PLEKHM1, two critical proteins known to regulate autophagosome fusion, for cleavage through the catalytic activity of viral proteinase 3C, ultimately impairing the formation of SNARE complexes. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of SNAP29/PLEKHM1 inhibits autophagic flux, resulting in increased viral replication. Collectively, our study reveals a mechanism that supports an emerging model whereby CVB3 hijacks the autophagic machinery to facilitate its own propagation.

Abstract: Summary
The influenza virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Yet, both the impact of intracellular viral replication and the variation in host response across different cell types remain uncharacterized. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity in the response of lung tissue cells to in vivo influenza infection. Analysis of viral and host transcriptomes in the same single cell enabled us to resolve the cellular heterogeneity of bystander (exposed but uninfected) as compared with infected cells. We reveal that all major immune and non-immune cell types manifest substantial fractions of infected cells, albeit at low viral transcriptome loads relative to epithelial cells. We show that all cell types respond primarily with a robust generic transcriptional response, and we demonstrate novel markers specific for influenza-infected as opposed to bystander cells. These findings open new avenues for targeted therapy aimed exclusively at infected cells.

Abstract: Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a common systemic skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone mass and microarchitecture deterioration. Although differentially expressed SOX5 has been found in bone marrow from ovariectomized mice, its role in osteogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from bone marrow in PMOP remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the biological function of SOX5 and explore its molecular mechanism in hMSCs from patients with PMOP. Our findings showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of SOX5 were upregulated in hMSCs isolated from bone marrow samples of PMOP patients. We also found that SOX5 overexpression decreased the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the gene expression of osteoblast markers including Collagen I, Runx2 and Osterix, which were increased by SOX5 knockdown using RNA interference. Furthermore, TNF-α notably upregulated the SOX5 mRNA expression level, and SOX5 knockdown reversed the effect of TNF-α on osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. In addition, SOX5 overexpression increased Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) gene expression, which was decreased by SOX5 silencing. KLF4 knockdown abrogated the suppressive effect of SOX5 overexpression on osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Taken together, our results indicated that TNF-α-induced SOX5 upregulation inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs through KLF4 signal pathway, suggesting that SOX5 might be a novel therapeutic target for PMOP treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Cone photoreceptors scale dynamically the sensitivity of responses to maintain responsiveness across wide range of changes in luminance. Synaptic changes contribute to this adaptation, but how this process is coordinated at the molecular level is poorly understood. Here, we report that a cell adhesion-like molecule, LRIT1, is enriched selectively at cone photoreceptor synapses where it engages in a trans-synaptic interaction with mGluR6, the principal receptor in postsynaptic ON-bipolar cells. The levels of LRIT1 are regulated by the neurotransmitter release apparatus that controls photoreceptor output. Knockout of LRIT1 in mice increases the sensitivity of cone synaptic signaling while impairing its ability to adapt to background light without overtly influencing the morphology or molecular composition of photoreceptor synapses. Accordingly, mice lacking LRIT1 show visual deficits under conditions requiring temporally challenging discrimination of visual signals in steady background light. These observations reveal molecular mechanisms involved in scaling synaptic communication in the retina.

Abstract: Summary
Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed genetic modules that regulate growth and persistence in bacteria. Many systems, including E. coli MazEF, include toxins that are endoribonucleases, but the full set of targets for these toxins remains poorly defined. Previous studies on a limited set of transcripts suggested that MazF creates a pool of leaderless mRNAs that are preferentially translated by specialized ribosomes created through MazF cleavage of mature 16S rRNA. Here, using paired-end RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling, we provide a comprehensive, global analysis of MazF cleavage specificity and its targets. We find that MazF cleaves most transcripts at multiple sites within their coding regions, with very few full-length, leaderless mRNAs created. Additionally, our results demonstrate that MazF does not create a large pool of specialized ribosomes but instead rapidly disrupts ribosome biogenesis by targeting both ribosomal protein transcripts and rRNA precursors, helping to inhibit cell growth.

Abstract: Summary
Diet, genetics, and the gut microbiome are determinants of metabolic status, in part through production of metabolites by the gut microbiota. To understand the mechanisms linking these factors, we performed LC-MS-based metabolomic analysis of cecal contents and plasma from C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, and 129S6/SvEvTac mice on chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD-treated with vancomycin or metronidazole. Prediction of the functional metagenome of gut bacteria by PICRUSt analysis of 16S sequences revealed dramatic differences in microbial metabolism. Cecal and plasma metabolites showed multifold differences reflecting the combined and integrated effects of diet, antibiotics, host background, and the gut microbiome. Eighteen plasma metabolites correlated positively or negatively with host insulin resistance across strains and diets. Over 1,000 still-unidentified metabolite peaks were also highly regulated by diet, antibiotics, and genetic background. Thus, diet, host genetics, and the gut microbiota interact to create distinct responses in plasma metabolites, which can contribute to regulation of metabolism and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
There is growing interest in pharmacological interventions directly targeting the aging process. Pharmacological interventions against aging should be efficacious when started in adults and, ideally, repurpose existing drugs. We show that dramatic lifespan extension can be achieved by targeting multiple, evolutionarily conserved aging pathways and mechanisms using drug combinations. Using this approach in C. elegans, we were able to slow aging and significantly extend healthy lifespan. To identify the mechanism of these drug synergies, we applied transcriptomics and lipidomics analysis. We found that drug interactions involved the TGF-β pathway and recruited genes related with IGF signaling. daf-2, daf-7, and sbp-1 interact upstream of changes in lipid metabolism, resulting in increased monounsaturated fatty acid content and this is required for healthy lifespan extension. These data suggest that combinations of drugs targeting distinct subsets of the aging gene regulatory network can be leveraged to cause synergistic lifespan benefits.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional repressor ΔNp63α is a potent oncogene widely overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of diverse tissue origins, where it promotes malignant cell proliferation and survival. We report here the results of a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify pathways controlling ΔNp63α-dependent cell proliferation, which revealed that the small GTPase RHOA blocks cell division upon ΔNp63α knockdown. After ΔNp63α depletion, RHOA activity is increased, and cells undergo RHOA-dependent proliferation arrest along with transcriptome changes indicative of increased TGF-β signaling. Mechanistically, ΔNp63α represses transcription of TGFB2, which induces a cell cycle arrest that is partially dependent on RHOA. Ectopic TGFB2 activates RHOA and impairs SCC proliferation, and TGFB2 neutralization restores cell proliferation during ΔNp63α depletion. Genomic data from tumors demonstrate inactivation of RHOA and the TGFBR2 receptor and ΔNp63α overexpression in more than 80% of lung SCCs. These results reveal a signaling pathway controlling SCC proliferation that is potentially amenable to pharmacological intervention.

Abstract: Summary
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with primary, precursor, and mature microRNAs (miRs) to influence mature miR levels, which in turn affect critical aspects of human development and disease. To understand how RBPs contribute to miR biogenesis, we analyzed human enhanced UV crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) datasets for 126 RBPs to discover miR-encoding genomic loci that are statistically enriched for RBP binding. We find that 92% of RBPs interact directly with at least one miR locus, and that some interactions are cell line specific despite expression of the miR locus in both cell lines evaluated. We validated that ILF3 and BUD13 directly interact with and stabilize miR-144 and that BUD13 suppresses mir-210 processing to the mature species. We also observed that DDX3X regulates primary miR-20a, while LARP4 stabilizes precursor mir-210. Our approach to identifying regulators of miR loci can be applied to any user-defined RNA annotation, thereby guiding the discovery of uncharacterized regulators of RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Several neuronal populations orchestrate neocortical development during mammalian embryogenesis. These include the glutamatergic subplate-, Cajal-Retzius-, and ventral pallium-derived populations, which coordinate cortical wiring, migration, and proliferation, respectively. These transient populations are primarily derived from other non-cortical pallial sources that migrate to the dorsal pallium. Are these migrations to the dorsal pallium conserved in amniotes or are they specific to mammals? Using in ovo electroporation, we traced the entire lineage of defined chick telencephalic progenitors. We found that several pallial sources that produce tangential migratory neurons in mammals only produced radially migrating neurons in the avian brain. Moreover, ectopic expression of VP-specific mammalian Dbx1 in avian brains altered neurogenesis but did not convert the migration into a mammal-like tangential movement. Together, these data indicate that tangential cellular contributions of glutamatergic neurons originate from outside the dorsal pallium and that pallial Dbx1 expression may underlie the generation of the mammalian neocortex during evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Actin assembly is important for cell motility. The ability of actin subunits to join or leave filaments via the barbed end is critical to actin dynamics. Capping protein (CP) binds to barbed ends to prevent subunit gain and loss and is regulated by proteins that include V-1 and CARMIL. V-1 inhibits CP by sterically blocking one binding site for actin. CARMILs bind at a distal site and decrease the affinity of CP for actin, suggested to be caused by conformational changes. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to probe changes in structural dynamics induced by V-1 and CARMIL binding to CP. V-1 and CARMIL induce changes in both proteins’ binding sites on the surface of CP, along with a set of internal residues. Both also affect the conformation of CP’s ββ subunit “tentacle,” a second distal actin-binding site. Concerted regulation of actin assembly by CP occurs through allosteric couplings between CP modulator and actin binding sites.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient deprivation induces autophagy through inhibiting TORC1 activity. We describe a novel mechanism in Drosophila by which TORC1 regulates RNA processing of Atg transcripts and alters ATG protein levels and activities via the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) complex. We show that TORC1 signaling inhibits CDK8 and DOA kinases, which directly phosphorylate CPSF6, a component of the CPA complex. These phosphorylation events regulate CPSF6 localization, RNA binding, and starvation-induced alternative RNA processing of transcripts involved in autophagy, nutrient, and energy metabolism, thereby controlling autophagosome formation and metabolism. Similarly, we find that mammalian CDK8 and CLK2, a DOA ortholog, phosphorylate CPSF6 to regulate autophagy and metabolic changes upon starvation, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism linking TORC1 signaling with RNA processing, autophagy, and metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Establishing synaptic contacts between neurons is paramount for nervous system function. This process involves transsynaptic interactions between a host of cell adhesion molecules that act in cooperation with the proteins of the extracellular matrix to specify unique physiological properties of individual synaptic connections. However, understanding of the molecular mechanisms that generate functional diversity in an input-specific fashion is limited. In this study, we identify that major components of the extracellular matrix proteins present in the synaptic cleft—members of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) family—associate with the GPR158/179 group of orphan receptors. Using the mammalian retina as a model system, we demonstrate that the HSPG member Pikachurin, released by photoreceptors, recruits a key post-synaptic signaling complex of downstream ON-bipolar neurons in coordination with the pre-synaptic dystroglycan glycoprotein complex. We further demonstrate that this transsynaptic assembly plays an essential role in synaptic transmission of photoreceptor signals.

Abstract: Summary
Type II cadherins are cell-cell adhesion proteins critical for tissue patterning and neuronal targeting but whose molecular binding code remains poorly understood. Here, we delineate binding preferences for type II cadherin cell-adhesive regions, revealing extensive heterophilic interactions between specific pairs, in addition to homophilic interactions. Three distinct specificity groups emerge from our analysis with members that share highly similar heterophilic binding patterns and favor binding to one another. Structures of adhesive fragments from each specificity group confirm near-identical dimer topology conserved throughout the family, allowing interface residues whose conservation corresponds to specificity preferences to be identified. We show that targeted mutation of these residues converts binding preferences between specificity groups in biophysical and co-culture assays. Our results provide a detailed understanding of the type II cadherin interaction map and a basis for defining their role in tissue patterning and for the emerging importance of their heterophilic interactions in neural connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoid and other adipogenic hormones are secreted in mammals in circadian oscillations. Loss of this circadian oscillation pattern correlates with obesity in humans, raising the intriguing question of how hormone secretion dynamics affect adipocyte differentiation. Using live, single-cell imaging of the key adipogenic transcription factors CEBPB and PPARG, endogenously tagged with fluorescent proteins, we show that pulsatile circadian hormone stimuli are rejected by the adipocyte differentiation control system. In striking contrast, equally strong persistent signals trigger maximal differentiation. We identify the mechanism of how hormone oscillations are filtered as a combination of slow and fast positive feedback centered on PPARG. Furthermore, we confirm in mice that flattening of daily glucocorticoid oscillations significantly increases the mass of subcutaneous and visceral fat pads. Together, our study provides a molecular mechanism for why stress, Cushing’s disease, and other conditions for which glucocorticoid secretion loses its pulsatility may lead to obesity.

Abstract: Summary
We analyzed 921 adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum to examine shared and distinguishing molecular characteristics of gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas (GIACs). Hypermutated tumors were distinct regardless of cancer type and comprised those enriched for insertions/deletions, representing microsatellite instability cases with epigenetic silencing of MLH1 in the context of CpG island methylator phenotype, plus tumors with elevated single-nucleotide variants associated with mutations in POLE. Tumors with chromosomal instability were diverse, with gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas harboring fragmented genomes associated with genomic doubling and distinct mutational signatures. We identified a group of tumors in the colon and rectum lacking hypermutation and aneuploidy termed genome stable and enriched in DNA hypermethylation and mutations in KRAS, SOX9, and PCBP1.

Abstract: Summary
The underlying mechanisms of how self-renewing cells are controlled in regenerating tissues and cancer remain ambiguous. PCNA-associated factor (PAF) modulates DNA repair via PCNA. Also, PAF hyperactivates Wnt/β-catenin signaling independently of PCNA interaction. We found that PAF is expressed in intestinal stem and progenitor cells (ISCs and IPCs) and markedly upregulated during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Whereas PAF is dispensable for intestinal homeostasis, upon radiation injury, genetic ablation of PAF impairs intestinal regeneration along with the severe loss of ISCs and Myc expression. Mechanistically, PAF conditionally occupies and transactivates the c-Myc promoter, which induces the expansion of ISCs/IPCs during intestinal regeneration. In mouse models, PAF knockout inhibits Apc inactivation-driven intestinal tumorigenesis with reduced tumor cell stemness and suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity, supported by transcriptome profiling. Collectively, our results unveil that the PAF-Myc signaling axis is indispensable for intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis by positively regulating self-renewing cells.

Abstract: Summary
Paralogous transcription factors (TFs) are oftentimes reported to have identical DNA-binding motifs, despite the fact that they perform distinct regulatory functions. Differential genomic targeting by paralogous TFs is generally assumed to be due to interactions with protein co-factors or the chromatin environment. Using a computational-experimental framework called iMADS (integrative modeling and analysis of differential specificity), we show that, contrary to previous assumptions, paralogous TFs bind differently to genomic target sites even in vitro. We used iMADS to quantify, model, and analyze specificity differences between 11 TFs from 4 protein families. We found that paralogous TFs have diverged mainly at medium- and low-affinity sites, which are poorly captured by current motif models. We identify sequence and shape features differentially preferred by paralogous TFs, and we show that the intrinsic differences in specificity among paralogous TFs contribute to their differential in vivo binding. Thus, our study represents a step forward in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of differential specificity in TF families.

Abstract: Summary
Classical mechanisms through which brain-derived molecules influence behavior include neuronal synaptic communication and neuroendocrine signaling. Here we provide evidence for an alternative neural communication mechanism that is relevant for food intake control involving cerebroventricular volume transmission of the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). Results reveal that the cerebral ventricles receive input from approximately one-third of MCH-producing neurons. Moreover, MCH cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels increase prior to nocturnal feeding and following chemogenetic activation of MCH-producing neurons. Utilizing a dual viral vector approach, additional results reveal that selective activation of putative CSF-projecting MCH neurons increases food intake. In contrast, food intake was reduced following immunosequestration of MCH endogenously present in CSF, indicating that neuropeptide transmission through the cerebral ventricles is a physiologically relevant signaling pathway for energy balance control. Collectively these results suggest that neural-CSF volume transmission signaling may be a common neurobiological mechanism for the control of fundamental behaviors.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) play a pivotal role in vascular regeneration in ischemic tissues; however, their therapeutic application in clinical settings is limited due to the low quality and quantity of patient-derived circulating EPCs. To solve this problem, we evaluated whether three priming small molecules (tauroursodeoxycholic acid, fucoidan, and oleuropein) could enhance the angiogenic potential of EPCs. Such enhancement would promote the cellular bioactivities and help to develop functionally improved EPC therapeutics for ischemic diseases by accelerating the priming effect of the defined physiological molecules. We found that preconditioning of each of the three small molecules significantly induced the differentiation potential of CD34+ stem cells into EPC lineage cells. Notably, long-term priming of OECs with the three chemical cocktail (OEC-3C) increased the proliferation potential of EPCs via ERK activation. The migration, invasion, and tube-forming capacities were also significantly enhanced in OEC-3Cs compared with unprimed OECs. Further, the cell survival ratio was dramatically increased in OEC-3Cs against H2O2-induced oxidative stress via the augmented expression of Bcl-2, a prosurvival protein. In conclusion, we identified three small molecules for enhancing the bioactivities of ex vivo-expanded OECs for vascular repair. Long-term 3C priming might be a promising methodology for EPC-based therapy against ischemic diseases.

Abstract: Flowering time is determined by florigens. These genes include, Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice FT 1 (RFT1) in rice, which are specifically expressed in the vascular tissues of leaves at the floral transition stage. To study the cis-regulatory elements present in the promoter region of Hd3a, we generated transgenic plants carrying the 1.75-kb promoter fragment of Hd3a that was fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Plants expressing this construct conferred a vascular cell-specific expression pattern for the reporter gene. However, GUS was expressed in leaves at all developmental stages, including the early seedling stage when Hd3a was not detected. Furthermore, the reporter was expressed in roots at all stages. This suggests that the 1.75-kb region lackings cis-elements that regulate leaf-specific expression at the appropriate developmental stages. Deletion analyses of the promoter region indicated that regulatory elements determining vascular cell-specific expression are present in the 200-bp region between -245 bp and -45 bp from the transcription initiation site. By transforming the Hd3a–GUS construct to rice cultivar ‘Taichung 65’ which is defective in Ehd1, we observed that Ehd1 is the major regulatory element that controls Hd3a promoter activity.

Abstract: Summary
In Alzheimer’s disease, neurofibrillary tangle pathology appears to spread along neuronal connections, proposed to be mediated by the release and uptake of abnormal, disease-specific forms of microtubule-binding protein tau MAPT. It is currently unclear whether transfer of tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia or reflects a constitutive biological process. We report two entry mechanisms for monomeric tau to human neurons: a rapid dynamin-dependent phase typical of endocytosis and a second, slower actin-dependent phase of macropinocytosis. Aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerization and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with endocytosis and distinct from macropinocytosis, the major route for aggregated tau entry reported for non-neuronal cells. Anti-tau antibodies abrogate monomeric tau entry into neurons, but less efficiently in the case of aggregated tau, where internalized tau carries antibody with it into neurons. These data suggest that tau entry to human neurons is a physiological process and not a disease-specific phenomenon.

Abstract: Summary
While it is appreciated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as second messengers in both homeostastic and stress response signaling pathways, potential roles for ROS during early vertebrate development have remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that fertilization in Xenopus embryos triggers a rapid increase in ROS levels, which oscillate with each cell division. Furthermore, we show that the fertilization-induced Ca2+ wave is necessary and sufficient to induce ROS production in activated or fertilized eggs. Using chemical inhibitors, we identified mitochondria as the major source of fertilization-induced ROS production. Inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production in early embryos results in cell-cycle arrest, in part, via ROS-dependent regulation of Cdc25C activity. This study reveals a role for oscillating ROS levels in early cell cycle regulation in Xenopus embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian genomes are promiscuously transcribed, yielding protein-coding and non-coding products. Many transcripts are short lived due to their nuclear degradation by the ribonucleolytic RNA exosome. Here, we show that abolished nuclear exosome function causes the formation of distinct nuclear foci, containing polyadenylated (pA+) RNA secluded from nucleocytoplasmic export. We asked whether exosome co-factors could serve such nuclear retention. Co-localization studies revealed the enrichment of pA+ RNA foci with “pA-tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection” components MTR4, ZFC3H1, and PABPN1 but no overlap with known nuclear structures such as Cajal bodies, speckles, paraspeckles, or nucleoli. Interestingly, ZFC3H1 is required for foci formation, and in its absence, selected pA+ RNAs, including coding and non-coding transcripts, are exported to the cytoplasm in a process dependent on the mRNA export factor AlyREF. Our results establish ZFC3H1 as a central nuclear pA+ RNA retention factor, counteracting nuclear export activity.

Abstract: Summary
Human studies suggest that a meal elevates glucose uptake in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, in postprandial state the thermogenic activity and the metabolism of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in BAT remain unclear. Using indirect calorimetry combined with positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), we showed that whole-body and BAT thermogenesis (oxygen consumption) increases after the ingestion of a mixed carbohydrate-rich meal, to the same extent as in cold stress. Postprandial NEFA uptake into BAT is minimal, possibly due to elevated plasma insulin inhibiting lipolysis. However, the variation in postprandial NEFA uptake is linked to BAT thermogenesis. We identified several genes participating in lipid metabolism to be expressed at higher levels in BAT compared with white fat in postprandial state, and to be positively correlated with BAT UCP1 expression. These findings suggest that substrates preferred by BAT in postprandial state are glucose or LPL-released NEFAs due to insulin stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria associate with lipid droplets (LDs) in fat-oxidizing tissues, but the functional role of these peridroplet mitochondria (PDM) is unknown. Microscopic observation of interscapular brown adipose tissue reveals that PDM have unique protein composition and cristae structure and remain adherent to the LD in the tissue homogenate. We developed an approach to isolate PDM based on their adherence to LDs. Comparison of purified PDM to cytoplasmic mitochondria reveals that (1) PDM have increased pyruvate oxidation, electron transport, and ATP synthesis capacities; (2) PDM have reduced β-oxidation capacity and depart from LDs upon activation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and β-oxidation; (3) PDM support LD expansion as Perilipin5-induced recruitment of mitochondria to LDs increases ATP synthase-dependent triacylglyceride synthesis; and (4) PDM maintain a distinct protein composition due to uniquely low fusion-fission dynamics. We conclude that PDM represent a segregated mitochondrial population with unique structure and function that supports triacylglyceride synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) display a complex spectrum of mutations and chromosomal aberrations. Chromosome 5q (5q) loss is detected in up to 70% of TNBCs, but little is known regarding the genetic drivers associated with this event. Here, we show somatic deletion of a region syntenic with human 5q33.2–35.3 in a mouse model of TNBC. Mechanistically, we identify KIBRA as a major factor contributing to the effects of 5q loss on tumor growth and metastatic progression. Re-expression of KIBRA impairs metastasis in vivo and inhibits tumorsphere formation by TNBC cells in vitro. KIBRA functions co-operatively with the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 to trigger mechanotransduction-regulated signals that inhibit the nuclear localization of oncogenic transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ. Our results argue that the selective advantage produced by 5q loss involves reduced dosage of KIBRA, promoting oncogenic functioning of YAP/TAZ in TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Succinate accumulates during ischemia, and its oxidation at reperfusion drives injury. The mechanism of ischemic succinate accumulation is controversial and is proposed to involve reversal of mitochondrial complex II. Herein, using stable-isotope-resolved metabolomics, we demonstrate that complex II reversal is possible in hypoxic mitochondria but is not the primary succinate source in hypoxic cardiomyocytes or ischemic hearts. Rather, in these intact systems succinate primarily originates from canonical Krebs cycle activity, partly supported by aminotransferase anaplerosis and glycolysis from glycogen. Augmentation of canonical Krebs cycle activity with dimethyl-α-ketoglutarate both increases ischemic succinate accumulation and drives substrate-level phosphorylation by succinyl-CoA synthetase, improving ischemic energetics. Although two-thirds of ischemic succinate accumulation is extracellular, the remaining one-third is metabolized during early reperfusion, wherein acute complex II inhibition is protective. These results highlight a bifunctional role for succinate: its complex-II-independent accumulation being beneficial in ischemia and its complex-II-dependent oxidation being detrimental at reperfusion.

Abstract: Summary
Cell proliferation can be dependent on the non-essential amino acid serine, and dietary restriction of serine inhibits tumor growth, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Using a metabolomics approach, we found that serine deprivation most predominantly impacts cellular acylcarnitine levels, a signature of altered mitochondrial function. Fuel utilization from fatty acid, glucose, and glutamine is affected by serine deprivation, as are mitochondrial morphological dynamics leading to increased fragmentation. Interestingly, these changes can occur independently of nucleotide and redox metabolism, two known major functions of serine. A lipidomics analysis revealed an overall decrease in ceramide levels. Importantly, supplementation of the lipid component of bovine serum or C16:0-ceramide could partially restore defects in cell proliferation and mitochondrial fragmentation induced by serine deprivation. Together, these data define a role for serine in supporting mitochondrial function and cell proliferation through ceramide metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1)-signaling system plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by sensing and integrating multiple extracellular and intracellular cues. Therefore, uncovering the effectors of mTORC1 signaling is pivotal to understanding its pathophysiological effects. Here we report that the transcription factor forkhead/winged helix family k1 (Foxk1) is a mediator of mTORC1-regulated gene expression. Surprisingly, Foxk1 phosphorylation is increased upon mTORC1 suppression, which elicits a 14-3-3 interaction, a reduction of DNA binding, and nuclear exclusion. Mechanistically, this occurs by mTORC1-dependent suppression of nuclear signaling by the Foxk1 kinase, Gsk3. This pathway then regulates the expression of multiple genes associated with glycolysis and downstream anabolic pathways directly modulated by Foxk1 and/or by Foxk1-regulated expression of Hif-1α. Thus, Foxk1 mediates mTORC1-driven metabolic rewiring, and it is likely to be critical for metabolic diseases where improper mTORC1 signaling plays an important role.

Abstract: Summary
KDM6A, an X chromosome-encoded histone demethylase and member of the COMPASS-like complex, is frequently mutated in a broad spectrum of malignancies and contributes to oncogenesis with poorly characterized mechanisms. We found that KDM6A loss induced squamous-like, metastatic pancreatic cancer selectively in females through deregulation of the COMPASS-like complex and aberrant activation of super-enhancers regulating ΔNp63, MYC, and RUNX3 oncogenes. This subtype of tumor developed in males had concomitant loss of UTY and KDM6A, suggesting overlapping roles, and points to largely demethylase independent tumor suppressor functions. We also demonstrate that KDM6A-deficient pancreatic cancer is selectively sensitive to BET inhibitors, which reversed squamous differentiation and restrained tumor growth in vivo, highlighting a therapeutic niche for patient tailored therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Acute respiratory tract viral infections (ARTIs) cause significant morbidity and mortality. CD8 T cells are fundamental to host responses, but transcriptional alterations underlying anti-viral mechanisms and links to clinical characteristics remain unclear. CD8 T cell transcriptional circuitry in acutely ill pediatric patients with influenza-like illness was distinct for different viral pathogens. Although changes included expected upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), transcriptional downregulation was prominent upon exposure to innate immune signals in early IFV infection. Network analysis linked changes to severity of infection, asthma, sex, and age. An influenza pediatric signature (IPS) distinguished acute influenza from other ARTIs and outperformed other influenza prediction gene lists. The IPS allowed a deeper investigation of the connection between transcriptional alterations and clinical characteristics of acute illness, including age-based differences in circuits connecting the STAT1/2 pathway to ISGs. A CD8 T cell-focused systems immunology approach in pediatrics identified age-based alterations in ARTI host response pathways.

Abstract: Elevation of Ca2+i and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are considered as major signals triggering transcriptomic changes in exercising skeletal muscle. Electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) of cultured myotubes is widely employed as an in vitro model of muscle contraction. This study examines the impact of Ca2+i-mediated and Ca2+i-independent signaling in transcriptomic changes in EPS-treated C2C12 myotubes. Electrical pulse stimulation (40 V, 1 Hz, 10 ms, 2 h) resulted in [Ca2+]i oscillations, gain of Na+i, loss of K+i, and differential expression of 3215 transcripts. Additions of 10 μM nicardipine abolished [Ca2+]i oscillations but did not affect elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio seen in EPS-treated myotubes. Differential expression of 1018 transcripts was preserved in the presence of nicardipine, indicating a Ca2+i-independent mechanism of excitation–transcription coupling. Among nicardipine-resistant transcripts, we noted 113 transcripts whose expression was also affected by partial Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition with 30 μM ouabain providing the same elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio as in EPS-treated cells. Electrical pulse stimulation increased phosphorylation of CREB, ATF-1, Akt, ERK, and p38 MAPK without any impact on phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase-1, i.e. downstream markers of AMPK activation. Unlike CREB, ATF-1, and MAPKs, an increment in Akt phosphorylation was abolished by nicardipine. Thus, our results show that Ca2+i-independent signaling plays a key role in altered expression of 30% of studied genes in EPS-treated myotubes. This signaling pathway is at least partially triggered by dissipation of transmembrane gradients of monovalent cations.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in PLA2G6 (PARK14) cause neurodegenerative disorders in humans, including autosomal recessive neuroaxonal dystrophy and early-onset parkinsonism. We show that loss of iPLA2-VIA, the fly homolog of PLA2G6, reduces lifespan, impairs synaptic transmission, and causes neurodegeneration. Phospholipases typically hydrolyze glycerol phospholipids, but loss of iPLA2-VIA does not affect the phospholipid composition of brain tissue but rather causes an elevation in ceramides. Reducing ceramides with drugs, including myriocin or desipramine, alleviates lysosomal stress and suppresses neurodegeneration. iPLA2-VIA binds the retromer subunits Vps35 and Vps26 and enhances retromer function to promote protein and lipid recycling. Loss of iPLA2-VIA impairs retromer function, leading to a progressive increase in ceramide. This induces a positive feedback loop that affects membrane fluidity and impairs retromer function and neuronal function. Similar defects are observed upon loss of vps26 or vps35 or overexpression of α-synuclein, indicating that these defects may be common in Parkinson disease.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming provides critical information for clinical oncology. Using molecular data of 9,125 patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified tumor subtypes in 33 cancer types based on mRNA expression patterns of seven major metabolic processes and assessed their clinical relevance. Our metabolic expression subtypes correlated extensively with clinical outcome: subtypes with upregulated carbohydrate, nucleotide, and vitamin/cofactor metabolism most consistently correlated with worse prognosis, whereas subtypes with upregulated lipid metabolism showed the opposite. Metabolic subtypes correlated with diverse somatic drivers but exhibited effects convergent on cancer hallmark pathways and were modulated by highly recurrent master regulators across cancer types. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrated that knockdown of SNAI1 or RUNX1—master regulators of carbohydrate metabolic subtypes—modulates metabolic activity and drug sensitivity. Our study provides a system-level view of metabolic heterogeneity within and across cancer types and identifies pathway cross-talk, suggesting related prognostic, therapeutic, and predictive utility.

Abstract: Summary
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a medically important respiratory plus-strand RNA virus of children that has been linked to acute flaccid myelitis. We have determined that EV-D68 induces autophagic signaling and membrane formation. Autophagy, a homeostatic degradative process that breaks down protein aggregates and damaged organelles, promotes replication of multiple plus-strand viruses. Induction of autophagic signals promotes EV-D68 replication, but the virus inhibits the downstream degradative steps of autophagy in multiple ways. EV-D68 proteases cleave a major autophagic cargo adaptor and the autophagic SNARE SNAP29, which reportedly regulates fusion between autophagosome to amphisome/autolysosome. Although the virus inhibits autophagic degradation, SNAP29 promotes virus replication early in infection. An orphan SNARE, SNAP47, is shown to have a previously unknown role in autophagy, and SNAP47 promotes the replication of EV-D68. Our study illuminates a mechanism for subversion of autophagic flux and redirection of the autophagic membranes to benefit EV-D68 replication.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is the carrier of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in plasma high-density lipoproteins. S1P is a bioactive lipid interacting with five receptors (S1P1–5). We show that lack of apoM in mice increases the amount of brown adipose tissue (BAT), accelerates the clearance of postprandial triglycerides, and protects against diet-induced obesity (i.e., a phenotype similar to that induced by cold exposure or β3-adrenergic stimulation). Moreover, the data suggest that the phenotype of apoM-deficient mice is S1P dependent and reflects diminished S1P1 stimulation. The results reveal a link between the apoM/S1P axis and energy metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The brain cancer medulloblastoma consists of different transcriptional subgroups. To characterize medulloblastoma at the phosphoprotein-signaling level, we performed high-throughput peptide phosphorylation profiling on a large cohort of SHH (Sonic Hedgehog), group 3, and group 4 medulloblastomas. We identified two major protein-signaling profiles. One profile was associated with rapid death post-recurrence and resembled MYC-like signaling for which MYC lesions are sufficient but not necessary. The second profile showed enrichment for DNA damage, as well as apoptotic and neuronal signaling. Integrative analysis demonstrated that heterogeneous transcriptional input converges on these protein-signaling profiles: all SHH and a subset of group 3 patients exhibited the MYC-like protein-signaling profile; the majority of the other group 3 subset and group 4 patients displayed the DNA damage/apoptotic/neuronal signaling profile. Functional analysis of enriched pathways highlighted cell-cycle progression and protein synthesis as therapeutic targets for MYC-like medulloblastoma.

Ribosomal Protein S12e Has a Distinct Function in Cell Competition,

Abstract: Summary
Wild-type Drosophila cells can remove cells heterozygous for ribosomal protein mutations (known as “Minute” mutant cells) from genetic mosaics, a process termed cell competition. The ribosomal protein S12 was unusual because cells heterozygous for rpS12 mutations were not competed by wild-type, and a viable missense mutation in rpS12 protected Minute cells from cell competition with wild-type cells. Furthermore, cells with Minute mutations were induced to compete with one another by altering the gene dose of rpS12, eliminating cells with more rpS12 than their neighbors. Thus RpS12 has a special function in cell competition that defines the competitiveness of cells. We propose that cell competition between wild-type and Minute cells is initiated by a signal of ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency mediated by RpS12. Since competition between cells expressing different levels of Myc did not require RpS12, other kinds of cell competition may be initiated differently.

TED-Seq Identifies the Dynamics of Poly(A) Length during ER Stress,

Abstract: Summary
Post-transcriptional RNA processing is a core mechanism of gene expression control in cell stress response. The poly(A) tail influences mRNA translation and stability, but it is unclear whether there are global roles of poly(A)-tail lengths in cell stress. To address this, we developed tail-end displacement sequencing (TED-seq) for an efficient transcriptome-wide profiling of poly(A) lengths and applied it to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human cells. ER stress induced increases in the poly(A) lengths of certain mRNAs, including known ER stress regulators, XBP1, DDIT3, and HSPA5. Importantly, the mRNAs with increased poly(A) lengths are both translationally de-repressed and stabilized. Furthermore, mRNAs in stress-induced RNA granules have shorter poly(A) tails than in the cytoplasm, supporting the view that RNA processing is compartmentalized. In conclusion, TED-seq reveals that poly(A) length is dynamically regulated upon ER stress, with potential consequences for both translation and mRNA turnover.

Structural Basis of Transcription Inhibition by Fidaxomicin (Lipiarmycin A3),

Abstract: Summary
Fidaxomicin is an antibacterial drug in clinical use for treatment of Clostridium difficile diarrhea. The active ingredient of fidaxomicin, lipiarmycin A3 (Lpm), functions by inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here we report a cryo-EM structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNAP holoenzyme in complex with Lpm at 3.5-Å resolution. The structure shows that Lpm binds at the base of the RNAP “clamp.” The structure exhibits an open conformation of the RNAP clamp, suggesting that Lpm traps an open-clamp state. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirm that Lpm traps an open-clamp state and define effects of Lpm on clamp dynamics. We suggest that Lpm inhibits transcription by trapping an open-clamp state, preventing simultaneous interaction with promoter −10 and −35 elements. The results account for the absence of cross-resistance between Lpm and other RNAP inhibitors, account for structure-activity relationships of Lpm derivatives, and enable structure-based design of improved Lpm derivatives.
