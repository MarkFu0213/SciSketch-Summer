Abstract: Sb2S3-xSex (0 ≤x ≤ 3) is promising for practically applicable solar cell since it possesses excellent stability, suitable band gap, high extinction coefficient and abundant elemental storage. This study demonstrates a novel methodology towards simultaneous dissolution of Se and Sb2O3 for direct deposition of Sb2S3-xSex films. Mechanistic study shows that the formation of selenium-nitrogen free radical in sulfur-containing complex is responsible for the dissolution of selenium. The energy levels of the as-synthesized Sb2S3-xSex were examined by synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy, revealing that more Se in the Sb2S3-xSex leads to the valence band shifting considerably upward while the conduction band remaining nearly unchanged. Moreover, for the first time we present that the solution processed Sb2S3-xSex can generate photovoltaic performance with an efficiency of 5.8%. This research provides a straightforward strategy for the fabrication of Sb2S3-xSex solar cells and offers an effective method for the synthesis of metal selenosulfide films.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an alternative and fully experimental procedure based only on external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements for characterizing the efficiency and transmittance of downshifters placed on photovoltaic (PV) devices. The experimental setup requires two PV devices as references, one of them showing a zero EQE in the downshifting spectral range. Therefore, the results obtained are independent of the quantum efficiency of the device, easing the analysis and comparison between experimental results. Also, this method avoids complex theoretical modeling proposed in other works. Those theoretical models are usually based on approximations and/or that require some input parameters difficult to determine without a wide range of experimental equipment in the lab.

Abstract: Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel in combination with weekly carboplatin area under curve 2 followed by anthracycline chemotherapy.
Patients and methods
This is a retrospective review of electronic medical records of patients (N = 32) with stage 1c–III triple-negative breast cancer. Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 once per week for 12 weeks in combination with carboplatin area under curve 2 once per week for 12 weeks (wP + wCb), followed by a standard anthracycline regimen including either doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 2 or 3 weeks, or epirubicin 90 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for four cycles with myeloid growth factor support.
Results
Most patients (91%) received all 12 cycles of wP + wCb, and 88% received all four planned cycles of anthracycline chemotherapy. Of the patients, 84% completed all planned therapies. The complete pathologic response rate was 60%. In terms of hematologic toxicity, 96% of the patients experienced grade ≥3 leucopenia, 40% grade ≥3 anemia, and 15% grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, and neutropenic fever was seen in 22% of the patients.
Conclusion
The combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with wP + wCb before anthracycline chemotherapy can be tolerated by patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Complete pathologic response rates were comparable with those historically seen. Careful selection of patients is fundamental as this regimen is associated with a high incidence of hematologic toxicity.

Abstract: Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is characterized by intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep. SAS and obesity are strongly related to each other. Here, we investigated the effect of IH on the expression of major appetite regulatory genes in human neuronal cells. We exposed NB-1, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-SH human neuronal cells to IH (64 cycles of 5 min hypoxia and 10 min normoxia), normoxia, or sustained hypoxia for 24 h and measured the mRNA levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), galanin, galanin-like peptide, ghrelin, pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide, agouti-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, and melanocortin 4 receptor by real-time RT-PCR. IH significantly increased the mRNA levels of POMC and CART in all the neuronal cells. Deletion analysis revealed that the −705 to −686 promoter region of POMC and the −950 to −929 region of CART were essential for the IH-induced promoter activity. As possible GATA factor binding sequences were found in the two regions, we performed real-time RT-PCR to determine which GATA family members were expressed and found that GATA2 and GATA3 mRNAs were predominantly expressed. Therefore, we introduced siRNAs against GATA2 and GATA3 into NB-1 cells and found that GATA2 and GATA3 siRNAs abolished the IH-induced up-regulation of both POMC and CART mRNAs. These results indicate that IH stress up-regulates the mRNA levels of anorexigenic peptides, POMC and CART, in human neuronal cells via GATA2 and GATA3. IH can have an anorexigenic effect on SAS patients through the transcriptional activation of POMC and CART in the central nervous system.

Abstract: A ZnSnP2 bulk crystal was prepared by flux method and cut into a ZnSnP2 wafer with thickness of 200µm, which was utilized as the absorber of a ZnSnP2 solar cell with a Al/ZnO:Al/ZnO/(Cd,Zn)S buffer/ZnSnP2 wafer/Cu structure. A 3.44%-efficient ZnSnP2 solar cell was obtained. Moreover, we assessed performance of the ZnSnP2 solar cell concentrating on main loss mechanisms limiting device efficiency. Based on investigations of the majority carrier barrier at ZnSnP2 and the Cu back electrode, the barrier height is estimated to be 59meV, which could limit the fill factor of the solar cell and should be decreased. In addition, voltage-independent recombination rates at the buffer/absorber interface (Ri0), in the space-charge region (Rd0), and in the quasi-neutral region (Rb0) of the ZnSnP2 solar cell were determined from illumination dependence of the open-circuit voltage. It was found that Rd0 is 2.65×1013cm−2s−1, much high than Ri0 + Rb0 of 1.2×109cm−2s−1. The high Rd0 was attributed to the mechanical surface polish of the ZnSnP2 wafer. It is thought that Rb0 should be lower than Ri0 because of the large ZnSnP2 grain and non-optimized buffer/absorber interface. These findings suggested that Ri0 and Rd0 should be further decreased to enhance photovoltaic performance.

Abstract: Direct absorption solar collector (DASC) is a promising technology for solar energy harvesting. Recently, nanofluids have shown great potential for DASC applications due to their tunable optical absorption properties. An advanced composite combining plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and hedgehog-like hierarchically structured ZnO particles (HPs) was prepared and used in DASCs. The nanofluid prepared with 1.0mgmL−1 HP-Au exhibited excellent stability and broadband optical absorption properties, and reached an equilibrium temperature of ~125°C within 1h of solar heating at an irradiation power of 10kWm−2. A new photothermal conversion efficiency model was established to evaluate the solar harvesting performance of the HP-Au/oil nanofluid by simultaneously considering the effect of the working fluid temperature on the heating and cooling efficiencies. Compared to the base fluid, the HP-Au/oil nanofluid exhibits a 240% enhancement in photothermal conversion efficiency. The HP-Au/oil nanofluid shows great potential as a working fluid in direct absorption solar collectors.

Abstract: Solar photo-thermal conversion is the simplest way to utilize solar energy by using nanofluid as the working medium. In this paper, we aim to investigate the broadband optical absorption and high-performance photo-thermal conversion via CuS nanofluids to realize the efficient solar energy utilization. Nanostructured CuS nanospheres and nanotubes were successfully synthesized by using simple hydrothermal reaction. The crystal structures, element compositions and surface properties of the obtained CuS nanostructures were characterized. And the formation mechanisms of the nanostructured CuS were discussed. The optical absorption and photo-thermal conversion performances of the CuS nanofluids based on water were studied. The UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra tests show that the CuS nanofluids prepared have strong optical absorption in both visible light and near infrared light regions. The photo-thermal conversion results indicate that the CuS nanofluids possess good photo-thermal conversion performances, and the maximum temperature of the nanofluid reaches about 72.15 ℃ only with the volume fraction of 0.02% related to the nanotube nanofluid. Moreover, at the same volume fractions, the nanotube nanofluids show better photo-thermal conversion performances than those of the nanosphere nanofluids. This implies a simple approach to enhance photo-thermal conversion for efficient solar energy utilization.

Abstract: Single-crystalline sodium tungsten bronze (Na-WO3) nanorods with typical diameters of 10–200nm and lengths of several microns have been prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. The as-prepared Na-WO3 nanorods crystallize in a hexagonal structure and elongate along the <001> crystallographic direction. The as-prepared Na-WO3 nanorods have eight diagnostic Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorptions at 3604, 3545, 1622, 1600, 983, 790, 480 and 430cm−1, which represent specific fingerprints of the vibrational features of hexagonally tunnel-structured Na-WO3 containing tunnel water molecules. The as-prepared Na-WO3 nanorods exhibit a typical cathodic electrochromism, which is related to a proton-electron double insertion process. X-ray diffraction results indicate a phase transformation of hexagonal Na-WO3 nanorods during the electrochromic process, of which the involved local structural evolutions such as water decomposition and proton insertion have been discussed by using FTIR spectroscopy. The results suggest that, during the electrochromic coloration process, the inserted protons might occupy the small trigonal tunnel positions instead of the large hexagonal ones.

Abstract: High-efficiency (11.1%) Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells have been obtained only with low-sulfur absorbers because the incorporation of high sulfur content is typically accompanied by a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) deficit. In this research, a sulfur content of 40% (x = 0.4) was obtained by postsulfurization. In comparison with a low-sulfur CZTSSe with x = 0.13, an efficiency of 9.8%, a band gap of 1.05eV, and a Voc of 446mV, the proposed cell had an efficiency of 11.1%, a band gap of 1.2eV and a Voc of 578mV; the post-sulfurization caused a very small increase in the Voc deficit (approximately 18mV). Approximately 250-nm-thick S-rich CZTSSe layer was found near the surface and was close to the depletion width (approximately 238.5nm) of the p-n junction, indicating a double-layered CZTSSe included a high-sulfur top layer was responsible for the high Voc. Admittance spectroscopy showed the activation energy of the bulk defect was 138meV; this revealed some deep-level defects were associated with the low short-circuit current at long wavelengths. The activation energy of the interfacial defects was 1.08eV, indicating the Voc deficits of future devices may be decreased by suitable surface treatment of high-sulfur-content CZTSSe devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate a series of semi-polar InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (QW) based solar cells with high indium content, where operating wavelength ranges from green to amber. These devices are grown on high crystal quality overgrown semi-polar GaN templates. The spectral response at a long wavelength of up to 560nm has been obtained. With increasing indium content of QWs (i.e., increasing operating wavelength), the external quantum efficiency increases across a wide range of wavelength. Compared to the device with green QWs, the devices with amber QWs exhibits significantly increased short-circuit current density and conversion efficiency, achieving a current density of 1.4mA/cm2 and an enhancement factor of 170% under the AM 1.5G illumination. Photoluminescence excitation measurements show that it is attributed to enhanced light absorption in InGaN QWs by pushing the QW absorption edge towards longer wavelength. Furthermore, another series of InGaN QW solar cells is investigated with different indium contents in the three QWs of each device. The device with two yellow QWs on the top and one blue QW underneath exhibits spectral response at a long wavelength of up to 560nm, whereas the device with one blue QW on the top and two yellow QWs underneath shows no response beyond 460nm. It reveals that the InGaN QW closest to the top p-type GaN plays a determined role in the spectral response on the long wavelength side.

Abstract: Inverted polymer solar cells based on P3HT/PCBM bulk heterojunction were prepared on flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate. The effect of annealing of the PEN/ITO/ZnO multilayer and ZnO/P3HT:PCBM on the structural, morphological, photophysical and photovoltaic properties was investigated and scrutinized directly on the OPV devices using atom probe tomography (APT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microfocus X-ray techniques. We carried out a 3D reconstruction of the interfaces of the multilayer containing PEN/ITO, ZnO/ITO and P3HT:PCBM/ZnO to address the interface micro-structure and its influence on the morphology of the photoactive film. The analyses show that the morphology of the interfaces is affected by the structure of each layer of the BHJ devices causing orientation of P3HT crystals with PCBM aggregates and ZnO, which in turn leads to a significant change of the charge transport across each layer and therefore photovoltaic performances.

Abstract: A rational design of metal-free hierarchical nanostructures is critical for achieving next-generation photocatalytic system. Transition metal dichalcogenide, e.g., MoS2 based heterostructures (HSs) with shape-controlled TiO2 have attracted great attention in visible light electrocatalysis owing to their unique crystal structure, morphology and chemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate a low temperature solvothermal growth of few layer MoS2 nanoflowers (NFs) over the porous TiO2(B) nanobelts (NBs) for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media as well as improved photocatalytic degradation of organic dye rhodamine-B (RhB) under visible light. Few-layer MoS2 NFs with lateral sizes 130–350 nm were successfully grown on TiO2 NBs, as revealed from the high resolution TEM imaging. EDS mapping confirms the elemental composition and their spatial distribution in the HS sample. MoS2/TiO2 NBs HS exhibits extremely high adsorption ability (66% after 40 min) under dark as well as enhanced photocatalytic degradation efficiency (80% after 60 min) of RhB under visible light irradiation. A systematic photoelectrochemical measurements demonstrate that the MoS2/TiO2 NBs HS exhibits excellent HER activity in acidic electrolyte with an overpotential and estimated Tafel slope to be −320 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and 95 mV/dec, respectively, which is much lower than that of the pristine TiO2 NBs measured to be −792 mV and 135 mV/dec, respectively, under visible light. It is shown that the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism leads to the extremely high hydrogen generation at the working electrode made with edge-defect enriched few layer MoS2 on porous TiO2 NBs.

Abstract: Semi-transparent perovskite solar cells with spray coated silver nanowire (AgNW) and AgNW/ZnO composite top electrode were fabricated and investigated. For the spray coated AgNW electrode, both sheet resistance (Rs) and averaged visible light transmittance over 400–800 nm (AVT) decrease with the decrease of nozzle moving speed, which is ascribed to the increase of AgNW density of the electrode. A highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.27% with a low AVT of 16.3% was achieved for a small area cell having AgNW top electrode with Rs of 15 Ω/□. A thin layer of ZnO nano particles was coated onto the AgNW electrode, which decreases the sheet resistance of the AgNW/ZnO composite electrode. Such a conductivity enhancement is ascribed to the improvement the interconnection between AgNWs by filling the voids between AgNW wires with ZnO nanoparticles. In the meanwhile, owing to the light scattering effect of ZnO nano particles, light transparence in the visible light range (400–800 nm) of the AgNW/ZnO composite electrode increases slightly after the deposition of ZnO layer. Both device performance and reproducibility of the perovskite solar cells are improved by using the AgNW/ZnO top electrode. As an example, power conversion efficiency of 7.30% with an AVT of 23.3% was achieved for a small solar cell using AgNW electrode with Rs of 78 Ω/□. While a highest PCE of 11.13% with the same AVT was achieved for the same cell after the deposition of ZnO layer, demonstrating the cover effect of ZnO layer. A high PCE of 8.18% was also achieved for a AgNW/ZnO based cell with an area of 1 cm2, which is more than 50% enhancement than the AgNW based cell (5.35%).

Abstract: Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells with a certified power conversion efficiency of 11.28% were characterized using camera-based heterodyne lock-in carrierography (HeLIC) and photocarrier radiometry (PCR). Carrier lifetime, diffusivity, and diffusion and drift length of a CQD solar cell were imaged in order to investigate carrier transport dynamics, as well as solar cell homogeneity and the effects of Au contacts on carrier transport dynamics. Using room temperature HeLIC imaging which has also been demonstrated using PCR measurements, shorter carrier lifetimes (ca. 0.5μs) were found in Au contact regions that can be attributed to enhanced non-radiative recombinations through trap states at Au/CQD interfaces. This imaging methodology shows strong potential for elucidating the energy loss physics of CQD solar cells and for industrial non-destructive large-area photovoltaic device characterization.

Abstract: Objectives
To detect the frequency of CD209 A>G polymorphism in sickle cell disease (SCD) Egyptian patients and to evaluate the use of CD209 A>G polymorphism as a genetic predictor of SCD clinical heterogeneity.
Methods
A total of 100 Egyptian children with SCD and 100 Egyptian controls were tested for CD209 A>G polymorphism and were followed up prospectively between June 2012 and December 2014.
Results
Comparison of CD209 A>G polymorphism among cases and controls did not show statistically significant difference (p = .742). In addition, comparison of the allelic frequency did not show statistically significant difference (p = .738). Infections occurred more frequently among the heterozygous genotype (AG; 60.5%) and homozygous genotype (GG; 75%) patients than among the wild (AA) genotype (24.1%; p < .001). The use of hydroxyurea treatment was significantly higher among the wild (AA) genotype (47%) than the heterozygous (AG; 21%) and homozygous (GG; 5%) genotypes (p = .003).
Conclusion
We found no significant difference between our population of Egyptian SCD cases and controls regarding CD209 A>G polymorphism. Infections occurred more frequently among the heterozygous genotype (AG) and homozygous genotype (GG) patients.

Abstract: The environmental performance of four different device assembly procedures based on hybrid halide perovskite solar cell (PSC) were assessed from cradle to grave using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. In addition, a new environmental indicator was defined to measure the time evolution of an impact category, specifically in this case, human toxicity cancer payback time. PSCs procedures accounted for the probably three more used basic recipes for laboratory perovskite deposition: 1) spin coating of stoichiometric precursor solution, 2) spin coating of precursor solution using lead chloride precursor and 3) the two step deposition method. Also, the two most widely used substrate configurations (planar and mesoporous substrate)were considered. LCA included three realistic scenarios for the end of life: 1) residual landfill, 2) reuse and residual landfill and 3) reuse and recycling. The remaining variable parameters to assemble the device were fixed in common for all four devices, which were the major responsible of the whole PSC impact. Lead of PSCs had no significant contribution in environmental impacts. Beyond shared procedure steps, impacts generated by the two-step method and the use of mesostructured type substrate were higher. End of life scenario with reuse and recycling improved the toxicity impact categories.

Abstract: One-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanorod (NR) arrays, are expected to improve the photovoltaic (PV) response of solar cells with an ultrathin absorber due to an increased areal (junction) density and light trapping. We report on the deposition of CdS and CdTe:As semiconductor thin films on ZnO NR arrays by means of metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). The change in optical properties of the ZnO NRs upon the growth of CdS shell was monitored and compared to the simulated data, which confirmed the presence of strong light scattering effects in the visible and near infrared regions. The PV performance of nanostructured vs. planar CdS/CdTe solar cells (grown using the material from the same MOCVD run) showed similar conversion efficiencies (~ 4%), despite the current density being lower for the nanostructured cell due to its thicker CdS window. A clear improvement in the quantum efficiency was however observed in the near infrared region, resulting from the light trapping by the ZnO/CdS core-shell NR structure. We also showed that reduction of surface defects and use of high absorber carrier density would boost the efficiency beyond that of planar CdTe solar cells. The reported device performance and the direct observation of light trapping are promising towards optimisation of extremely-thin-absorber CdTe PV devices.

Abstract: In this work, we report on using RF sputtering technique for the deposition of the molybdenum back contact for CIGS solar cells. This allows to realize the back and front contact (Aluminum doped ZnO is used for the front contact) with the same deposition system. We demonstrate that deposition pressure controls the morphology and resistivity of the Mo back contact. This latter point has been the subject of apparently contradicting reports in the literature, but an analysis of the deposition parameters versus sputtering mechanisms allow to understand this spread of results. Full cells have been grown onto the various sets of Mo films, and their electrical properties (efficiencies, Voc, Jcc and fill factors) are analyzed and modeled. From this, we obtain the ideality factors (reflecting the amount of carrier recombination) and with the shunt resistances we find these to be the main parameters which explains the different cells performances versus Mo back contact growth conditions. Low temperature photoluminescence is used as a tool to get a deeper insight on the recombination paths in the samples and support the conclusions drawn from electrical measurements: the molybdenum films grown at 1Pa yields the best cells results, owing to minimized non radiative recombination. Finally, using the optimum Mo films and improving the quality of the top contact allow us to obtain CIGS solar cells with efficiencies of 17%, although the CIGS, CdS and ZnO layers are not still fully optimized.

Abstract: Formulation engineering, featuring with different ingredients combined, is a useful strategy for making efficient electronic acceptors because it can achieve effects that cannot be obtained from its components when these are used singly. Herein, we show a contour plot with different formulations of isomeric phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as electron acceptors in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):PC71BM polymer solar cells (PSCs). Upon altering fullerene formulation the PCEs change in the range of 0.87–4.01%. The optimized formulation consisting of ~ 80% α-PC71BM, ~ 10% β1-PC71BM, and ~ 10% β2-PC71BM exhibits the best PCE of 4.01%, which mainly benefits from the optimum morphology of P3HT-fullerene heterojunction film. The present work demonstrates a successful strategy by controlling morphology of PC71BM isomers to improve the PCE of P3HT-based PSCs, and consolidates the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells heavily dependent on the formulation of fullerene-based electron acceptors.

Abstract: In situ transformation and dissolution–crystallization mechanisms play a competing role in determining the characteristics of perovskite films that greatly affect the device performance of perovskite solar cells in the sequential two-step process. Herein, we develop a facile solution engineering to balance the transformation from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 and dissolution–crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 crystal growth, producing pure phase CH3NH3PbI3 crystals for high-efficient planar-structure solar cells. Low concentration of CH3NH3I in a mixed solvent of isopropanol/cyclohexane with low polarity is applied to suppress dissolution–crystallization (Ostwald ripening growth) of perovskite, while increases the transformation time from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3. Combination of porous PbI2 and temperature-assistance effectively promote the transformation from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 and reduce the time of Ostwald ripening growth of perovskite. This solution engineering reconciles the complete PbI2 transformation and dissolution–crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3, resulting in a pure phase perovskite without any residual PbI2 in a short time. This strategy exemplified here can serve in the design and development of more sophisticated perovskites based on planar-structure applications without mesoporous TiO2 scaffold.

Abstract: The sodium form of industrial X-zeolite (13X) was compared with two other samples obtained by a partial (about 70%) cation exchange with Mg2+ (Mg-X) or a complete exchange with Ca2+ (Ca-X) in view of their use as adsorbents for water vapor in energy storage systems by sorption. Various sorption methods based on the specific interactions between two probing molecules (N2 and NH3) and specific surface sites were employed to monitor the hydration state of the zeolite surface as a function of the temperature of sample drying performed under vacuum degassing or gas-flow conditions. X-ray diffraction, volumetric sorption technique, temperature-programmed desorption, and gas flow calorimetry were combined with Monte Carlo simulations of the mechanism of water vapor adsorption on model zeolites to demonstrate that the general tendency to operate under mild drying conditions would always result in a state of partial hydration of the zeolite surface. To increase the amount of heat released upon subsequent adsorption from a flow of helium at a relative pressure of water vapor of about 0.03, the use of Mg-X sample was demonstrated the best alternative if the activation procedure was to be performed at 200°C. Here, the heat effect was 4–5 times greater than that measured in the case of 13X. This result is of high importance for the industrial-scale implementation of the energy storage by sorption.

Abstract: Here we present a highly flexible and large-area CuS transparent conductive film (TCF) fabricated by colloidal crackle pattern as a counter electrode (CE) for flexible dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC). This rectangular CuS TCF can be fabricated on arbitrary flexible substrates at low temperature and exhibits superior mechanical robustness in bending cycling measurement. The transmittance and conductivity can be accurately controlled by controlling the sizes and shapes of the crackle patterns, ~ 90% transmittance can be achieved when the sheet resistances (Rs) are ~ 60Ω sq−1. Moreover, such CuS TCF has strong receivable ability of pH (1−13) and temperature changes (0–100°C). In the application of DSSC as CE, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses of the CuS networks exhibit a comparable electrocatalytic behavior with the platinum (Pt) networks on polyethylene terephthalate (PET), yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.54% for DSSC based on CuS networks as CE and retaining > 90% PCE after 500 bending cycles. Such CuS TCF with high transparency, flexibility, conductivity and electrochemical catalytic ability shows great potentials in other wearable, light-weight electrochemical cells.

Abstract: Nanofluids have shown competitive performance on solar thermal collection. This work proposes the application of Chinese ink as nanofluid in solar photo-thermal conversion. The dispersion stability of the nanofluid was characterized by spectrophotometer. Compared with reported Cu, CuO nanofluids, that of Chinese ink has shown more satisfied stability of dispersion. The obtained results reveal that the nanofluid of Chinese ink has surprisingly higher efficiency of photo-thermal conversion than that of Cu and CuO nanoparticles. Carbon black is determined for Chinese ink nanofluid to convert solar photo to heat. Bone glue coated on the surface of Chinese ink nanoparticle also plays a significant role that it prevents the carbon black nanoparticles from aggregation and deposition. The preparation process of Chinese ink is pretty simple and the raw materials are cheap and widely available, which promises the large-scale industrial applications of Chinese ink for solar thermal collections.

Abstract: GaSb based photovoltaic devices have been demonstrated on GaAs substrates by inducing interfacial array of 90° misfit dislocations. Despite the beneficial qualities of the highly stable 90° misfit dislocation, there is a significant density of residual threading dislocations in the GaSb layer, resulting in the degradation of the electrical performance of such photovoltaic cells compared to lattice matched devices. We aim to reduce threading dislocation density by optimizing growth temperature and by using an AlSb dislocation filtering layer. The growth temperature optimization results in a reduction of the threading dislocation density to 1.3 × 108 cm−2. Adding an AlSb dislocation filtering layer further improves the electrical performance of the GaSb solar cells by reducing the threading dislocation density to 4 × 107 cm−2. A comparison between the experimental data and theoretical calculation confirms that the recombination in dislocation centers is a dominant loss mechanism in GaSb solar cell grown on GaAs substrate.

Abstract: This paper presents the experimental characterisation of three zeotype materials, namely, AlPO-18, FAPO-34 and SAPO-34, suitable for adsorption heat transformation applications, employing water as refrigerant. Morphological and thermo-physical analyses were performed on each sample. In particular, the adsorption capacity of each material was evaluated by measuring a complete set of water vapour adsorption/desorption isotherms, in order to investigate the hysteresis effect. The obtained equilibrium data were fitted by means of Dubinin-Astakhov equation, both for adsorption and desorption branches. Finally, a thermodynamic analysis of the achievable performance of these three working pairs was performed under three main operating conditions, namely, thermal energy storage, air conditioning and heat pumping. The achieved results confirmed the potentiality of these adsorbents, showing promising cooling and thermal COP, up to 0.80 and 1.60 respectively, and heat storage capacities both for daily and seasonal operation.

Abstract: Notch signaling plays an essential role in the proliferation, differentiation and cell fate determination of various tissues, including the developing pancreas. One regulator of the Notch pathway is GDE2 (or GDPD5), a transmembrane ecto-phosphodiesterase that cleaves GPI-anchored proteins at the plasma membrane, including a Notch ligand regulator. Here we report that Gdpd5-knockdown in zebrafish embryos leads to developmental defects, particularly, impaired motility and reduced pancreas differentiation, as shown by decreased expression of insulin and other pancreatic markers. Exogenous expression of human GDE2, but not catalytically dead GDE2, similarly leads to developmental defects. Human GDE2 restores insulin expression in Gdpd5a-depleted zebrafish embryos. Importantly, zebrafish Gdpd5 orthologues localize to the plasma membrane where they show catalytic activity against GPI-anchored GPC6. Thus, our data reveal functional conservation between zebrafish Gdpd5 and human GDE2, and suggest that strict regulation of GDE2 expression and catalytic activity is critical for correct embryonic patterning. In particular, our data uncover a role for GDE2 in regulating pancreas differentiation.

Abstract: A low temperature deposition process was developed to fabricate ultra-thin, transparent, multi-layered electrodes (TMEs) suitable to be used on variously shaped flexible substrates, as those utilized in the transparent solar cells of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. The fabricated TMEs consisted of a bottom layer (BL) of gallium doped zinc oxide (GZO), an Ag-layer, and optoelectronic-controlling layers (OCLs) of GZO; and exhibited a high transmittance of 90% at 550 nm, and a low sheet resistance of 9.4 Ω/sq. at the thickness of ~ 100 nm. Because the Ag of TMEs easily detach from inorganic or amorphous surfaces, the GZO-BL was chemically treated in a diluted acetic and nitric acid mixture (10:2) to generate changes in its surface energy and improve the Ag adhesion. To quantitatively evaluate the Ag adhesion of TMEs, we proposed and conducted a tape pull-out adhesion test, and found the optimum GZO-BL texturing condition. The developed TMEs were used as the front transparent conductive electrodes of transparent a-Si:H solar cells to tune their reflection colors. By changing the thickness of the OCL, a wide range of colors was obtained without serious efficiency variations, as was predicted by optical simulations. The fabricated transparent cells show a high efficiency of 4.8%, as well as a high average transmittance of ~ 20% in the visible range. The developed TME structure, using the proposed deposition process, can be fabricated on various substrates and can be applied to devices that require a variety of colors such as BIPVs, wearable PVs, and the PVs of moving vehicles.

Abstract: Our research group fabricated low temperature based inverted semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite photovoltaics. The work function of PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) electrode was modified using polyethylenimine (PEI) and both layers are transferred on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM layer using hydrophobic polyurethane acrylate (PUA) polymer stamp. Even if the PH1000 spin coating on the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM layer shows degradation of perovskite due to the inter-diffusion of PH1000 solvent, drying transfer shows effective layer stacking without degradation. The PEI treatment on the PH1000 contributes to reduce the work function from 5.1eV to 3.97eV and this modification makes to improve the device performance from 0.07% to 4.02%. The full device average visible transmittance (AVT) exhibits 24.53% and the work function modification shows the decreased charge transporting resistance (Rc), which directly correlate to the enhanced open circuit voltage (Voc) short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).

Abstract: Direct Light-Induced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance was used for comparative study of magnetic, relaxation and dynamic parameters of spin charge carriers, polarons and methanofullerene anion radicals, photoinduced in bulk heterojunctions of composites formed by low-bandgap copolymers, poly[2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-alt-4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole] (PFO-DBT) and poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) with methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). A fraction of polarons is captured by deep spin traps reversibly initiated in the copolymer backbone due to its disordering. The number and energy depth of the traps are governed by the structure of copolymer matrix and photon energy. Both composites exhibit photo-response within photon energy/wavelength 1.32–3.14eV/940–395nm regions which is wider than those of other polymer composites. The magnetic, relaxation and dynamics parameters of the spin charge carriers were shown to be governed by the exchange interaction of their spins and photon energy. The specific morphology of the composites provokes extreme selectivity of these parameters to photon energy. The anisotropy of polaron mobility through bulk heterojunctions was shown to reflect the system dimensionality and is dependent on the photon energy. Compared to PFO-DBT, the structure of the PCDTBT composite is more organised, resulting in a decrease in the number of spin traps and a change in the order of the charge recombination process. The decay of free charge carriers is interpreted in terms of the trapping-detrapping spin diffusion in bulk heterojunctions.

Abstract: The application of TiO2 as part of the buffer layer stack in thin film Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells is investigated for the improvement of the photovoltaic device performance. In a standard device configuration a CdS/ZnO/Al:ZnO layer stack is applied onto the CIGS absorber layer. By decreasing the CdS buffer layer thickness a higher photocurrent is expected from a reduced parasitic absorption. When the CdS layer is not fully covering the CIGS surface, losses in VOC and FF are observed in I-V measurements due to the arising unfavorable CIGS/ZnO band alignment and sputter damage on the CIGS surface. Here we present thin TiO2 layers deposited by atomic layer deposition at low temperature as alternative to the unintentionally doped ZnO. With this approach, the photocurrent can be increased without adversely affecting VOC. Comparable device efficiency is achieved for the investigated structure and the reference process with the gain in current density being compensated by increased series resistance. Temperature dependent I-V measurements coupled with 1D-SCAPS simulations suggest a positive conduction band offset at the CdS/TiO2 interface limiting the FF. ALD-TiO2 is suggested as a more suitable intermediate buffer layer than sputtered ZnO when thin CdS buffer layers are applied.

Electrochemical measurements combined with advanced microscopy techniques were employed. Results confirmed oxidation to be the primary attack to all metals. Ferritic alloy 1008 was found the most vulnerable alloy with severe oxidative attack. Alloys 316 and 2205 showed close performance while grain boundary oxidative and sulfur attack threatened these materials. Alloy 2205 showed chromium depletion followed by selective oxidation of ferrite in the presence of a semi-protective film on the surface.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) have recently found a wide range of new application opportunities. One of their main constraints is their integration in complex geometries. Present work has prepared shapeable polymer composites with PCM capsules for thermal energy storage (TES) systems – ones that especially need specific integration requirements. Different preparation methods of PCMs are necessary to meet the integration obstacles. With the goal of filling the R&D gap, stearic acid was encapsulated in two different kinds of shells of SiO2 and PMMA and then incorporated into the PMMA matrix to form shapeable composites. Thermal, chemical, and physical properties of composites and their components were studied in comparison to the matrix material. This initial study showed that our novel shapeable PCM composites come with many advantages: less volume, no leakage, suitable storage capacities, as well as flexible shapes that can be easily engineered in various TES systems.

Abstract: A high performance antireflective (AR) should be a thin film with low refractive index, highly transparent, economical, and highly durable. In this paper, we present a novel synthesis of hollow Magnesium Fluoride (MgF2) nanoparticles, which is used to produce a high performance broadband antireflective coating. A formation–deformation-reformation route has been adopted to synthesize nanoparticles with hexagonal structure and cavities, which are crystalline and dispersible in any polar solvent. This facile synthesis route is a major breakthrough to achieve high performance broadband antireflective coating with an average transmittance of 98.3% in the visible range (400–800nm) and 96.2% in active solar range (300–1500nm). No significant drop in the efficiency was observed with antireflective-coated cover glass on the c-Si solar cell, whereas 6–7% efficiency loss was observed with uncoated glass. This can be a promising approach to develop high performance antireflective dielectric layer, which will enhance the overall performance of photovoltaic and solar thermal systems.

Abstract: In the manufacturing process of a common solar module, crystalline silicon solar cells are interconnected by soldering. Copper-based interconnectors, coated with a solder alloy are soldered on both sides of the solar cells on the contact metallization. Subsequently, the solar cell strings are embedded in between two sheets of encapsulant, commonly ethylene-vinyl acetat (EVA), which itself attaches to a front glass and a back sheet during the lamination process. Thermomechanical stress, due to the mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of copper and silicon, causes bowing of a back-contact solar cell after the soldering process. Additionally, thermomechanical stress can result in the failure of solder joints. By adapting the mechanical properties of an interconnector, thermomechanical stress can be reduced. Shaping a straight wire with a round cross section to a wave-like form reduces its effective tensile mechanical properties and leads to changes of its effective electrical conductivity. This study investigates the mechanical and electrical properties of wave-shaped wires with different amplitudes, periods and diameters. In addition, microscopic imaging reveals the geometry and potential defects due to the shaping process. The influence of the shaping process on the yield limit of commercially available copper-based wires is determined. For this reason, an algorithm is designed that allows the automatic and precise determination of the yield limit of these interconnectors. In this study, a maximum yield limit reduction of 88.5% compared to a straight wire is found. Furthermore, the influence of the shaping process on the electrical resistance is analyzed. For this purpose, the influence of wire damaging due to the shaping process, as well as the wires longitudinal length change is determined. An increase of the electrical resistance between 3.5% and 82.7% is measured. To choose an optimal interconnection concept for solar cells, the mechanical, as well as the electrical properties of the interconnectors have to be considered. This study correlates the advantageous longitudinal softness of wave-shaped wires, which potentially leads to a significant decrease of the thermomechanical stress in solar cells and of the bowing of back-contact solar cells, with the disadvantageous increase of the electrical resistance caused by the shaping process. The findings enable an optimization of a wire-based interconnection concept for back-contact solar cells.

Abstract: We have demonstrated that nanostructured Prussian blue (PB) film can be directly grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate by using a facile and template-free hydrothermal technique. The as-grown film with a lot of nanochannels is well adhesive to substrate. An electrochromic device fabricated using the as-grown PB film shows a fast coloration/bleaching response of 2.4/1.0s and a high coloration efficiency of 87.4cm2C−1, which shows a promising application in high-performance electrochromic smart windows.

Abstract: In preparing switchable mirrors, palladium (Pd) was used as a catalyst for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, and to prevent oxidation of the switchable layer. To reduce the cost, Pd was alloyed with ruthenium (Ru) and used as a catalytic layer, since the price of Ru is approximately one-tenth that of Pd. Switchable mirrors of magnesium-yttrium (Mg-Y) alloy thin films coated with a Pd-Ru layer were prepared by direct-current magnetron sputtering method. Their optical switching properties between reflective and transparent states were studied using gasochromic method. The mirrors coated with Pd1-αRuα of up to α ≈ 0.6 showed nearly the same switching time from reflective to transparent state as those coated with pure Pd, while the mirrors coated with Pd1-αRuα of 0.2 ≤ α ≤ 0.4 showed shorter switching times from transparent to reflective state than those coated with pure Pd. Furthermore, the alloy-coated mirrors with shorter switching times had approximately 2–3 times higher switching durability than those coated with pure Pd. These shorter time and higher durability may be because Pd-Ru alloy prevents oxidation of the underlying layers more effectively than pure Pd. Thus, Pd-Ru alloy is one of the most promising catalysts for switchable mirrors.

Abstract: To further increase the efficiency of thin film solar cells, it is critical to enhance the absorption over the full spectral wavelength range in which solar cells generate electricity. In this letter, we present a fullband absorption enhancement method for n-i-p thin film silicon solar cells based on a Quasi-Crystal Structure (QCS) by superimposing Ag random nanotextures on periodically patterned Micro-Cone Substrates. Both light in-coupling and light trapping abilities are significantly improved thanks to the reduction of front-surface reflection originated from the gradually changed refractive index of preserved micro-cone profile after film deposition and the richer guided mode resonances caused by the QCS. An initial efficiency of 10.4% is obtained for QCS-based hydrogenated amorphous silicon germanium (a-SiGe:H) solar cells, which outperforms the planar (efficiency of 7.5%) and randomly nanotextured (efficiency of 8.7%) counter part by 38.7% and 19.5%, respectively. The QCS can also be duplicated for other thin film photovoltaic devices and provides a new approach for creating high-efficiency thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: The activity of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) at α7 and α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) as well as at hippocampal α7-containing (i.e., α7*) AChRs is determined by using Ca2+ influx and electrophysiological recordings. To determine the inhibitory mechanisms, additional functional tests and molecular docking experiments are performed. The results established that TCAs (a) inhibit Ca2+ influx in GH3-α7 cells with the following potency (IC50 in μM) rank: amitriptyline (2.7 ± 0.3) > doxepin (5.9 ± 1.1) ∼ imipramine (6.6 ± 1.0). Interestingly, imipramine inhibits hippocampal α7* AChRs (42.2 ± 8.5 μM) in a noncompetitive and voltage-dependent manner, whereas it inhibits α9α10 AChRs (0.53 ± 0.05 μM) in a competitive and voltage-independent manner, and (b) inhibit [3H]imipramine binding to resting α7 AChRs with the following affinity rank (IC50 in μM): imipramine (1.6 ± 0.2) > amitriptyline (2.4 ± 0.3) > doxepin (4.9 ± 0.6), whereas imipramine’s affinity was no significantly different to that for the desensitized state. The molecular docking and functional results support the notion that imipramine noncompetitively inhibits α7 AChRs by interacting with two overlapping luminal sites, whereas it competitively inhibits α9α10 AChRs by interacting with the orthosteric sites. Collectively our data indicate that TCAs inhibit α7, α9α10, and hippocampal α7* AChRs at clinically relevant concentrations and by different mechanisms of action.

Abstract: Upon exposure to photooxidative conditions, organic materials are susceptible to undergo degradation via processes involving radical oxygen species and/or reaction with singlet oxygen (1O2). In this frame, the work herein presents a new and straightforward methodology to clarify the role of highly-reactive 1O2 in the photodegradation mechanism of conjugated materials applied in organic electronics. The general methodology consists in the comparison of the infrared signatures of the conjugated materials after the materials are exposed to photooxidative and thermooxidative conditions and in situ generated 1O2. The methodology was validated by analysing the behaviour of four donor materials commonly used in organic solar cells. Analysis of the degradation mechanism of these materials allowed exemplifying the three possible case scenarios, namely (1) both 1O2 and radical oxygen species are involved in the general photooxidation mechanism of the studied material, (2) the material is unreactive towards 1O2 and thus this species plays no role in the photooxidation process, and (3) the conjugated material is reactive towards chemically produced 1O2 but this species is not the main responsible for the photooxidative degradation of the material. In the latter two cases, a free-radical oxidation process accounts for the photooxidation of the investigated materials. The results derived from this simple, yet enlightening, methodology provide fundamental understanding about the degradation pathways of conjugated materials, which is a key point to develop not only efficient but also stable organic electronic devices.

Abstract: Nickel/Cobalt double hydroxide has attracted increasing attention as promising electrode material in supercapacitor field, but its poor adhesion in most conductive substrates largely thwarts the capacitance and cycling stability performance. In this work, an effective strategy was developed to synthesis Ni0.4Co0.6(OH)2 onto carbon fiber cloth (CFC) and obtained a flexible peony-like electrode (Ni0.4Co0.6(OH)2/CFC) by a simple step-by-step hydrothermal method without any adscititious alkali source and oxidant. Electrochemical studies showed that this type of Ni0.4Co0.6(OH)2/CFC exhibited an extraordinary capacitance of 1816Fg−1 (605Fcm−2) at the current density of 1.0Ag−1 and excellent cycling stability with capacitance retention of 98.3% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. After assembled to be a symmetric flexible solid supercapacitor, its electrochemical performances remained stability under flat, folded, twisted and rolled states. The remarkable electrochemical and flexible properties of Ni0.4Co0.6(OH)2/CFC developed in this study are obviously superior to those previously reported Ni0.4Co0.6(OH)2-based supercapacitors.

Abstract: Self-binding peptides containing zipper-like sequences, such as the Leu/Ile zipper sequence within the coiled coil regions of proteins and the cross-β spine steric zippers within the amyloid-like fibrils, could bind to the protein-of-origin through homophilic sequence-specific zipper motifs. These self-binding sequences represent opportunities for the development of biochemical tools and/or therapeutics. Here, we report on the identification of a putative self-binding β-zipper-forming peptide within the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike (S) protein and its application in viral detection. Peptide array scanning of overlapping peptides covering the entire length of S protein identified 34 putative self-binding peptides of six clusters, five of which contained octapeptide core consensus sequences. The Cluster I consensus octapeptide sequence GINITNFR was predicted by the Eisenberg’s 3D profile method to have high amyloid-like fibrillation potential through steric β-zipper formation. Peptide C6 containing the Cluster I consensus sequence was shown to oligomerize and form amyloid-like fibrils. Taking advantage of this, C6 was further applied to detect the S protein expression in vitro by fluorescence staining. Meanwhile, the coiled-coil-forming Leu/Ile heptad repeat sequences within the S protein were under-represented during peptide array scanning, in agreement with that long peptide lengths were required to attain high helix-mediated interaction avidity. The data suggest that short β-zipper-like self-binding peptides within the S protein could be identified through combining the peptide scanning and predictive methods, and could be exploited as biochemical detection reagents for viral infection.

Abstract: In this study, silicon solar cells with copper-plated front side metallisation were exposed to long-term reliability thermal stress conditions and the material integrity of the plated contacts after stress testing was investigated using imaging and electrical measurements. Significant voltage ‘bend-back’ was observed in Suns-VOC measurements at high illumination intensities (> 1Sun) following thermal stress testing at 200°C for 500h of laser-ablated cells with a nickel/copper/silver plated front metal grid. Using a combination of focussed ion beam milling, high resolution imaging and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, it was shown that large voids can form between the silver capping layer and the main copper stack during thermal annealing. However, even more revealing was the detection of a new metal layer comprising largely of diffused copper overlying the silver capping. The cause of the Schottky ‘bend-back’ behaviour was theorised to be due to increased contact resistance arising from the voids which are presumed to form as a result of grain boundary diffusion of copper through the silver capping layer. Errors of 5–10% in the determination of pFF from Suns-VOC occur as a result, with the scale of the error dependent on the capping method and sintering conditions. Collapsing the voids was subsequently shown to remove the Schottky behaviour and improve reliability of the fitted diode parameters extracted from Suns-VOC measurements.

Abstract: Phase change materials can be incorporated with building materials to make kinds of composite material, which can be applied in building systems due to their excellent thermal energy storage properties. In this study, a novel form-stable composite PCM CA-LA/Diatomite was prepared using vacuum impregnation method by combining a eutectic mixture of capric-lauric acid (CA-LA) as phase change material (PCM) and diatomite as supporting material. The composite products were characterized by using XRD, FT-IR and SEM analyzing methods. The thermal properties of the composite were measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that the composite material melted at 23.61 °C with a latent heat of 87.33 J/g and solidified at 22.50 °C with the latent heat of 86.93 J/g. TGA investigation revealed that the composite had excellent thermal durability above their working temperature ranges. The thermal cycling test showed the composite has a good thermal reliability after 200 thermal cycles. What's more, the expanded graphite was added into the composite in order to increase the heat transfer performance. The results showed that the thermal conductivity of the composite increased gradually by 39.7%, 61.6%, 77.6% and 114.2% for the EG fractions of 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10%, respectively. As a result, the CA-LA/Diatomite/EG composite material of has a potential to be applied in modern buildings and solar energy systems due to its excellent thermal properties, good chemical and thermal reliability and high thermal conductivity.

Abstract: The structure of frog eggs in the nature has inspiration for the designing of working fluids for solar thermal collection. This work explore the application of bionic structure mimicking frog eggs (BSMFE) as working fluid for solar photo-thermal conversion. According to the comparative experiments with Cu, CuO and carbon black nanofluids, it is found that the sustainability of suspension and photo-thermal conversion performance of BSMFE are better than those of other nanofluids, and BSMFE can achieve a higher heating rate in a short time. The performance of BSMFE-2 prepared from collagen protein and carbon black nanoparticles is better than that of BSMFE-1 prepared from bone glue and carbon black nanoparticles. This work provides an efficient but economical approach for industrial solar thermal collection.

Abstract: Both energy harvesting and storage are similarly constrained by materials availability and economics. Herein, we explore the dual use of earth-abundant and low cost Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) inks not only for solar cells but also energy storage devices. In this report, we only focus on less addressed but important novel issues. One is the effect of CZTS layer thickness on solar cell performance. The other is the properties of CZTS as a supercapacitor electrode. For solar cells, a study of the effect of CZTS thickness on device performance of 55 solar cells revealed that the highest efficiencies are achieved at a CZTS thickness of approximately 0.37µm. For energy storage, we achieved a highest reported areal (and specific) capacitance of 2.67F/cm2 (1709F/g) for CZTS. The dual use of CZTS for both energy harvesting and storage opens opportunities such as cheaper devices arising from economics of scale accompanying increased CZTS inks production.

Abstract: Soiling stands as a major problem for solar energy conversion technologies, causing unwanted transmittance, reflectance and absorbance losses. In this paper, a TraCS (Tracking Cleanliness Sensor) is used to quantify soiling effect in a flat mirror and to calculate soiling rates between periods without rain. Environmental parameters such as vertical wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity and particulate matter in the atmosphere are used as predictors to model soiling. Relations and trends between input and output are analyzed using a simple linear regression model and also through an interaction model. Further investigation is performed with a neural network approach to assess its viability for this type of problem and also for comparison with the previous models.

Efficient promotion of charge separation with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in BiVO4/rGO photoanode for greatly enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting,

Abstract: Although BiVO4 (BVO) continues to attract strong attention as an ideal reactive semiconductor, its photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance remains low because most of the charge carriers are easily recombined in the bulk or on the surface of the photoanode before reaching the fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO). This study presents a facile and simple, visible-light-assisted, photocatalytic reduction of graphene oxide (GO) by using BVO for the preparation of highly stable BVO/reduced GO (rGO) nanocomposites with two different rGO weight ratios (5% and 10%). These as-prepared BVO/rGO nanocomposites were then drop-cast on an FTO substrate to demonstrate the key role played by the rGO in greatly improving the electron transport in the BVO/rGO films. In PEC water splitting experiments, the BVO/rGO-10% photoelectrode showed the highest photocurrent density (554.4 µA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl), compared to BVO (111.7 µA cm−2) and BVO/rGO-5% (377.9 µA cm−2). The stable BVO/rGO also showed the highest charge carrier density, with an extended lifetime and improved the electrical conductivity, as compared to BVO. These results contributed to the excellent PEC performance of the BVO/rGO photoanode. Under simulated solar light illumination, the open-circuit potential (OCP) of the BVO/rGO films was shifted to a more negative value due to the enhanced electron-hole separation in the films. The photocurrent yields of the BVO and BVO/rGO electrodes were dependent on the solution pH. The photocurrent densities were higher over the full range of measured potential (0 to + 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in the NaOH electrolyte (1 M, pH = 13.5) than in the Na2SO4 electrolyte (0.1 M, pH = 6.5). This work demonstrates the essential role of the rGO coverage in the great enhancement of electron transport through the rGO in the BVO/rGO film.

Abstract: Perovskite/silicon-heterojunction solar cell is a very promising cell structure for using the solar spectrum efficiently and hence improving the energy conversion efficiency. However, perovskite solar cell based on solution technique requires the planar silicon-heterojunction bottom solar cell, which needs a different fabrication process from the textured substrate. In this paper, we developed the high performance planar silicon-heterojunction solar cell by introducing a novel design for the n-type back field and p-type emitter. The results indicate that a wide bandgap and low refractive index nc-SiOx:H for back field improves the open-circuit voltage, fill factor and short-circuit current density by the increased near-infrared long wavelength response. In addition, a nc-Si:H buffer layer between the a-Si:H passivation layer and p-nc-SiOx:H emitter increases the crystallinity in the emitter and then improves device performance further. Combining the developed nc-SiOx:H back field and p-nc-SiOx:H emitter, we achieved an efficiency of 18.77% (Certified 19.1%) on a smooth c-Si wafer. Realization of perovskite/silicon monolithic tandem solar cells with an over 1.7 V output voltage shows the potential application for solar to fuel generation and it also proves that the above strategies are very effective for improving the performance of bottom cell in the tandem solar cells.

Abstract: In this work, a quantum chemistry study was performed on the organometallic perovskites/organic hole transfer materials (HTMs) in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from the molecular engineering viewpoint. Density functional theory (DFT)/time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) was applied to investigate the electronic structures/excited state properties of a series of the perovskites, ABX3 (A=CH3NH3, NH4, CH(NH2)2, B˭Ge, Sn, Pb, X=Cl, Br, I). On the basis of the energy level of the perovskites, HTMs and TiO2, all perovskite compounds demonstrate a positive response to the hole/electron injection in the PSCs. A high occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) density of the HTMs, TPB, NPB, TPD, MDA1, MDA2, MDA3, TH101 and V950, are distributed over the whole molecule, homogeneously, which makes the hole transfer more proper. Investigation of the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs shows that they are strongly influenced by the chloride anion. The theoretical trend of the exciton binding energy is according to: F- < NH4- < MA-based perovskites. Considering different analyses show that the rate of the electron injection rate constant and the light harvesting efficiency increase by an increase in the electron driving force and electronic chemical potential. The correlation of the band gaps and the chemical nature of the substitutions in the perovskites shows a collapse by an increase in the cation size. Finally, it is proposed that ASnCl3 and AGeCl3 perovskites are better candidates to be applied in the PSCs as photosensitizers due to an improved incident photon to current efficiency.

Abstract: Light-driven, improved thermal conductivity and effective phase change enthalpy of polymeric composite material was prepared by one-pot synthesis approach based on the introduction of chromophoric polymer phase change material in nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC). Various characterization techniques were employed to investigate the thermal and structural properties of as-synthesized samples. The composite exhibited a light-to-heat conversion capacity of 72.1% owing to the introduction of environmental friendly and commercially available functional dye molecule in the polymer matrix. In addition, the composite achieved large energy storage efficiency per unit mass up to 180.3 J/g with high crystallinity, close to the maximum value since then documented for cross-linked polymeric composites, as well the composite achieving a thermal conductivity up to 178.3% with low porous carbon addition. The superior thermal storage performance could be ascribed to the advantages of NPC porous structure and interaction with hard segment results free phase change materials (PCMs) in a certain degree and used for high energy storage efficiency. Likewise, the composite revealed stable thermal performance with time saving strategy. This investigation gives an outlook for the synergistic improvement of thermal conductivity, solar-to-heat conversion capacity and latent heat of solid-solid PCMs.

Abstract: Electrochromic smart windows, which are able to vary their optical transmittance by the application of a voltage, improve the indoor comfort in buildings by controlling light and temperature. Among electrochromic devices, ECDs, WO3 and NiO are often associated leading to neutral color. This work focuses on the influence of the thickness of WO3 and NiO single layers on the ECD electrochemical and optical properties. Initial characterizations in lithium-based liquid electrolyte, show a non-linear evolution of the electrochemical capacity for each oxides vs. thickness while for similar thickness, WO3 thin films exhibit larger EC properties than NiO ones. The combinations of various WO3 and NiO thicknesses lead to ECDs of which capacity appears limited by the one of NiO, while the switch to a neutral color always remain. Besides, the influence of each oxide on the ECD cyclic voltammogram shape is discussed. Finally, the study of the cycling temperature, in the range −40°C to 80°C on the electrochromic properties of ITO/650nm-WO3/LiClO4-PC +PMMA/360nm-NiO/ITO shows an increase in performance with temperature nevertheless associated with signs of degradation above 60°C. At low temperature, the decrease in capacity is interestingly associated with a remaining significant optical contrast and the capacity recovery if the ECD is further cycled at RT.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of argon plasma assistance on the depletion of SiH4 in the preparation of μc-Si:H films via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). From optical emission spectrometry (OES) data of the μc-Si:H deposition, we infer that the excited Ar+ and metastable Ar* states enhance the dissociation of SiH4 and H2 molecules to generate ultra-depletion of SiH4. The ultra-depletion of SiH4 increases the μc-Si:H thin-film deposition rate from 4.5 Å/s to 23.4 Å/s at 6-sccm flow of SiH4. This ultra-depletion condition facilitates the gradual substitution of H2 by Ar, which leads to reduced crystallinity at low argon fractions (far), preferential crystallographic orientation along the (111) direction, and fluctuation of the hydrogen content and microstructure factor (R). Thus, the properties of the μc-Si:H thin films can be controlled via control of the atomic hydrogen generation and physical sputtering effects. The highest photosensitivity (2.2 × 103) is observed at far = 56%. Furthermore, we fabricate an a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cell with a total thickness of 1450 nm. The cell exhibits an initial efficiency of 11.44%, and the efficiency reduces to 10.24% after 1000 h of light soaking. The cell also exhibits a significantly higher Voc × FF stability over that of Jsc.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) in molten salts is the storage dominating technology in solar power applications today. In two-tank molten salt storage systems energy density ranges from 30 to 70kWh/m3 are achievable. The salt material used is a binary system, composed of 60% NaNO3 and 40% KNO3. In the 8 MWhth pilot plant built and tested by Abengoa, the storage tanks were made of steel A516Gr.70 using the Appendix M of code API 650 for their design. A specific testing device was developed to evaluate thermo-mechanical properties, and a study was conducted in order to evaluate tensile properties of A516Gr.70 specimens under operation conditions for the hot tank at the pilot plant that is in contact with molten salts at 380°C. Results confirmed the outcomes of the work: the reduction of the yield limit, elongation before fracture, and Young modulus at 380°C after having been 5min immersed in molten salts. Moreover, after a creep-test simulating operating 7 days conditions during, an additional reduction of the yield limit was measured.

Abstract: Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are performed using C3N4 post-treated TiO2 particles as photoanode materials. The photoanode materials were synthesized via a simple method by which a thin layer of C3N4 was coated onto the surface of TiO2 particles after the TiO2 was dipped in urea solution followed by calcination properly. The experimental results show that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the TiO2 DSSCs is remarkably improved. The measurements of I-V characteristic along with the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicate that the C3N4 layer can expand the visible light absorption, suppress the recombination reaction of the e−-h+ pair and increase both the open circuit voltage and the short-circuit photocurrent density. The mechanism of the improved performance of TiO2 DSSCs by C3N4 coating coating is proposed. The post-treatment method recorded in this work can be easily operated and achieve an enhanced photoelectric performance of DSSCs.

Abstract: The thermal emissivity of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) solar cells plays a role in determining the operating temperature of a solar cell. To elucidate the physical origin of thermal emissivity, we have made an experimental measurement of the full radiative spectrum of the crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell, which includes both absorption in the ultraviolet to near-infrared range and emission in the mid-infrared. Using optical modelling, we have identified the origin of radiative emissivity in both encapsulated and unencapsulated solar cells. We find that both encapsulated and unencapsulated c-Si solar cells are good radiative emitters but achieve this through different effects. The emissivity of an unencapsulated c-Si solar cell is determined to be 75% in the MIR range, and is dominated by free-carrier emission in the highly doped emitter and back surface field layers; both effects are greatly augmented through the enhanced optical outcoupling arising from the front surface texture. An encapsulated glass-covered cell has an average emissivity around 90% on the MIR, and dips to 70% at 10µm and is dominated by the emissivity of the cover glass. These findings serve to illustrate the opportunity for optimising the emissivity of c-Si based collectors, either in conventional c-Si PV modules where high emissivity and low-temperature operation is desirable, or in hybrid PV-thermal collectors where low emissivity enables a higher thermal output to be achieved.

Abstract: The design of latent heat thermal energy storage systems is critically dependent on the properties of the chosen Phase Change Material (PCM). Currently published data on the thermodynamic properties of eutectic salts contains contradictory data, impeding the selection of PCMs. In this work, previously elaborated theoretical methods for predicting the composition and enthalpy of fusion for eutectic salt mixtures is experimentally validated for three ternary eutectic mixtures: LiNO3 + NaNO3 + KNO3, Li2CO3 + Na2CO3 + K2CO3, and NaCl + Na2CO3 + Na2SO4. For each combination of salts, the eutectic composition suggested by published sources and the composition predicted by the theory are created. The latent heat of fusion, melting temperature, and congruency of the melting peak of these six mixtures are examined via differential scanning calorimetry. In addition, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy are used to verify the expected eutectic structure. Analysis of these six mixtures confirms that the composition can be predicted to within 8%. The enthalpy of fusion can be predicted to within 10% of experimental results. In addition, three binary eutectics (NaCl + Na2SO4, KCl + K2CO3, and NaCl + Na2CO3) are created and the theoretical enthalpy of fusion is experimentally verified.

Abstract: In this contribution, we present our recent results for high efficiency multicrystalline silicon solar cells. Based on n-type high-performance multicrystalline silicon substrates in combination with the TOPCon solar cell concept featuring a full area passivating back contact and a boron-diffused emitter as well as a plasma-etched black-silicon texture at the front side, a certified conversion efficiency of 22.3% has been achieved, which is currently the world record efficiency for multicrystalline silicon solar cells. A detailed loss analysis of the record solar cell batch discloses the nature of the remaining loss mechanisms, revealing the route for further improvements. We observe an efficiency gap between the multicrystalline and the FZ reference solar cells of ~1%abs. Compared to the FZ reference cells, the mc-Si cells also feature a significantly larger scattering in Voc and Jsc as well as a fill factor loss of ~1.5%abs. We show that the scattering in Jsc correlates with the area fraction of recombination-active structural crystal defects and the scattering in Voc additionally with lateral emitter-induced inhomogeneities. The fill factor loss is attributed to the general presence of strongly recombination-active grain boundaries. A detailed loss analysis of the record mc-Si solar cell shows that the major electrical losses are due to recombination at grain boundaries (0.7%abs) and recombination in the emitter (0.6%abs). By reducing these electrical loss channels, e.g. by an improved crystallization process together with a hydrogenation of the bulk and application of an adapted emitter, we expect to reach efficiencies for mc-Si solar cells in the range of 23%.

Abstract: One significant maintenance problem and cost associated with solar energy conversion systems is the soiling due to the accumulation of dust and other pollutants. In this work, we describe a scalable approach for applying antisoiling coatings based on superhydrophobic (SH) silica particles using a spray coating process. A large water contact angle (WCA) is one of the characteristics of excellent SH surfaces and because of the low surface energy and low adhesion forces the soiling rate is reduced. Our findings indicate that the WCA depends strongly on the ratio of the polymer binder and the nanoparticles. The nanoparticle surface coverage of the spray coated samples was substantially improved after rinsing with solvent. This process tended to remove large aggregates and excess polymer binder and further increased the WCA by allowing exposure of the functionalized nanoparticles. The durability of the SH coatings was enhanced when the substrate was pretreated with polymer binder and an optimal curing time between 30 and 60min. The abrasion tests of the SH coatings we report in this study showed that the WCA decreased from ~ 166° to ~ 157° after exposure to 2.6g of sand. Such coatings will help reduce costs of periodic cleaning of solar energy conversion systems (photovoltaic panels and concentrated solar mirrors).

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are promising alternative candidates for a variety of thermal energy storage and related applications. Among the PCMs, alkali carbonates have received particular attention in recent years due to their favourable thermophysical properties at high temperatures. However, the use of such carbonates as PCM requires the understanding of the structural information of the material particularly at both the solid and molten states and the composition dependence of the latent heat, which are largely lacking. Here we study, by both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, the latent heat of the binary carbonates Na2CO3/Li2CO3. The results show that the binary carbonates can convert to LiNaCO3 within a wide concentration range. A eutectic composition (EC) region of about 51mol. % Li2CO3 has shown the largest conversion to the LiNaCO3. Any excess loading of Na2CO3 or Li2CO3 beyond the EC region of the carbonates could lower the activation energy of diffusion. The solidification of the carbonates leads to a higher phase change resistance in the EC region with a higher activation energy Ea(pc) and a larger latent heat during the phase change.

Abstract: In this study, Al-rich InAlN thin films were grown at different substrate temperatures (Ts) by plasma-assisted dual source reactive evaporation and effects of the parameter on indium incorporation, morphology, structural and optical properties of the alloys were investigated. It was shown that indium content of the films increases at higher substrate temperature and the bandgap is decreased from 3.54 to 2.76 eV as Ts increases from 150° to 400 °C, respectively. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of the deposited films targeted for solar water splitting application was examined in the presence of simulated solar irradiation of AM 1.5 G (100 mW/cm2). The PEC measurements revealed a massive improvement in the photocurrent density for the InAlN sample deposited at Ts = 400 °C compared with the films grown at 150 °C. From the Mott-Schottky (MS) plots it was concluded that by increasing Ts up to 400 °C, charge transport during PEC process could be facilitated. It was shown that Al-rich InAlN with selected band gap and band alignments could be a potential candidate for PEC water splitting.

Abstract: Recently, it is reported that taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) participates in the tumor progression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miRNAs. Nonetheless, whether TUG1 could serve as a ceRNA of miR-144 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains undefined. Here, our results indicated that there was a marked rise in TUG1 expression in HCC tissues and cells, and downregulation of TUG1 hindered proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Additionally, TUG1 was validated to act as a molecular sponge of miR-144. Furthermore, we found that TUG1 interacting with miR-144 contributed to proliferation and migration of HCC cells via activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in vitro. Moreover, TUG1 knockdown inhibited HCC tumor growth in vivo through upregulating miR-144 via inactivation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, TUG1 interacting with miR-144 contributed to proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis through activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in HCC.

Abstract: Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial fission. Our previous studies proved that the inhibition of Drp1 may help attenuate traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced functional outcome and cell death through maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology and inhibiting activation of apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of Drp1 after TBI remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1), a small molecule inhibitor of Drp1, in underlying mechanisms of general autophagy and mitochondria autophagy (mitophagy) after experimental TBI. In vivo, we found that autophagosomes accumulated in cortical neurons at 24h after TBI, owing to the enhanced autophagy indicated by the accumulation of LC3 and the decrease of p62; but Mdivi-1 reversed the enhancement. Mdivi-1 also alleviated the number of LC3 puncta and TUNEL-positive structures in cells, indicating that autophagy maybe involved in Mdivi-1′s anti-apoptosis effects. Then, the expression level of mitochondrial dynamics related and mitophagy related proteins was assessed using the isolated mitochondria. The results showed that TBI-induced mitochondrial fission (represented by Drp1), mtDNA concentration down-regulation and PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)-Parkin mediated mitophagy activation were all inhibited by Mdivi-1. In addition, TBI-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 expression up-regulation were inhibited following Mdivi-1 treatment. In vitro, Mdivi-1 significantly alleviated the scratch injury-induced cell death, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ATP reduction in primary cortical neurons (PCNs). Additionally, the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) abrogated the Mdivi-1-induced decrease in autophagosomes accumulation and cell death at 24h both in the basal state and under the conditions of scratch cell injury. Together, these data demonstrate that Mdivi-1 mitigates TBI-induced BBB disruption and cell death at least in part by a mechanism involving inhibiting autophagy dysfunction and mitophagy activation.

Abstract: This paper reports simulations of gradual bandgap CIGS absorber and its impact on the characteristics of a solar cell. The bandgap of the CIGS absorber varies linearly and drops from Egmax (at the junction limit) to Egmin (in the vicinity of the rear contact).We introduce an effective absorption coefficient based on this variation. We will demonstrate that this gradual profile contributes to an improvement up to 171mV of the open circuit voltage Voc of the cell that is linked to the modification of the internal electrical field distribution within the absorber. However, a joint reduction of 1.50mA/cm2 of short circuit current density, Jsc, is observed. Overall, the conversion efficiency increases from 19.2%, for a uniform bandgap absorber structure, to 24.9% in that case of gradual bandgap. Additionally, we investigate the impact of absorber thickness and temperature on cell characteristics.

Abstract: CuSb(S,Se)2 is emerging as an alternative absorber for thin film photovoltaics, for its intrinsic p-type conductivity, tunable energy bandgap (1.0÷1.6 eV), high absorption coefficient > 104 cm−1 and very low cost of the constituent elements. In this work, we studied the structural, compositional and electro-optical properties of CuSbSe2 (CASe) films grown by Low Temperature Pulsed Electron Deposition (LTPED), a developing technology in thin film photovoltaics. We proved that stoichiometric or Cu-poor CASe films can be obtained at low temperature (< 200 °C) from a stoichiometric target with no need for post-deposition treatments to adjust the stoichiometry. Solar cells based on Cu-poor and stoichiometric CASe absorbers exhibit a similar open circuit voltage (∼290÷310 mV), while the JSC increases from ∼3 mA/cm2 up to ∼20 mA/cm2 as the Cu/Sb ratio increases from 0.55 to 0.95. A low FF ~40% still limits the performance of all the cells indicating that the standard architecture of thin film solar cells, currently used for CIGS and CdTe devices, need to be significantly reviewed. The results of the structural and optoelectrical characterization presented in this paper show that JSC, VOC and FF can all be improved as a result of the optimization of the device architecture. The best of the LTPED-grown CASe cells obtained so far, reached an efficiency of 3.8%, very close to the state of the art reported so far in literature.

Abstract: A large–grain and highly crystalline Cu3BiS3 thin film is successfully prepared by a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–based solution coating process. Without involving post sulfurization, Cu3BiS3 absorber with grain size of ~ 1µm has been achieved via a short-time drying of spin–coated precursor film on a hot plate at relatively low temperatures (< 300°C). Our Cu3BiS3 film exhibits a direct band gap of 1.47eV with high absorption coefficients (~ 7 × 104cm−1). Hall effect measurements reveal a p–type conductivity with hole concentration of ~ 1016cm−3 and mobility of 52.83cm2/(Vs). Moreover, an initial Cu3BiS3 thin film solar cell with the device structure of glass/Mo/Cu3BiS3/CdS/ZnO/ITO/Al is fabricated, achieving a definite conversion efficiency of 0.17%. The mild preparation condition promises great potential of current method in realizing Cu3BiS3 solar cells on temperature-sensitive substrates such as flexible polymer through an energy efficient way. The Cu3BiS3 has thus been presented as a promising absorber material for solar cell applications.

Abstract: In recent years CdTe thin film solar cells (SCs) have demonstrated promising market application foreground. However, a relatively large gap between the achieved SCs efficiencies and the theoretically predicted maximum efficiency still exists. In particular, the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the CdTe thin film SCs could be further increased, which is limited by high-work-function of CdTe. In this work, p-type narrow-gap SnTe thin films are proposed as a buffer layer in the back contact of CdTe SCs. The band alignment at SnTe/CdTe interface renders a small valance band offset, which expedites hole transport from the CdTe absorber to the hole electrode and improves the Ohmic contact for CdTe. With the insertion of a SnTe single buffer layer at the back contact, a Cu-free CdTe SC has been developed, which displays the same cell efficiency as the traditional cells using CuxTe as the back contact. The Voc of cells with ZnTe: Cu/SnTe double-layer at back contact is notably higher than the CdTe SCs fabricated with CuxTe or ZnTe: Cu single-layer at the back contact. Furthermore, accretion of hole concentration is also demonstrated by the diffusion of Sn in the CdTe absorber layer. This work shows the potential to improve CdTe SCs by using a narrow-gap IV-VI compound semiconductor.

Abstract: Background
Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy. Besides, increasing evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTTIP played a crucial role in cancer pathogenesis. MiR-637-mediated Akt1 was involved in cell growth, invasion and migration in various malignancies. This study was aimed to investigate the potential biological effect and regulatory mechanism of HOTTIP on cell proliferation, invasion and migration in PTC.
Methods
Expression of HOTTIP, miR-637 and Akt1 were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting in PTC tissues, normal tissues, PTC cells (TPC-1 and HTH83) or non-tumor thyroid cells (Nthy-ori 3-1). Cell proliferation, invasion and migration following HOTTIP knockdown were investigated in PTC cells. The target of HOTTIP was validated by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and pull-down assay. Moreover, a xenograft model was performed.
Results
HOTTIP was upregulated in human PTC tissues and PTC cell lines. In addition, HOTTIP knockdown inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro together with in vivo tumorigenesis of PTC cells. Additionally, HOTTIP knockdown downregulated Akt1 expression and suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration in PTC cells by regulating miR-637. In contrast, miR-637 inhibitor reversed above-mentioned tendencies caused by HOTTIP knockdown.
Conclusion
HOTTIP is a potential oncogene in PTC and may serve as a therapeutic target for malignancies.

Abstract: Although silicon has been widely employed as light harvesting antenna in photocatalysts due to its cost advantage, it suffers from low efficiency and poor stability due to photocorrosion of Si. To overcome this problem, a heterojunction photocathode was produced by coating a WS2 thin-film on p-type Si. Our proposed method can further improve the photocatalytic activity and stability. The homogeneous WS2 films with large surface area and tens-of-nanometers in thickness were prepared through magnetron and post-annealing process. This film not only functions as a protective layer to isolate the Si from the harsh electrochemical environment, but also forms a junction at the interface between WS2 and p-type Si to facilitate the charge separation and transport processes. Additionally, further enhancement of visible photocatalytic performance was achieved by depositing Au film on WS2/p-Si through thermal evaporation and the highest value of the photocurrent intensity achieved is up to ~ 4.5μA/cm2 at 0V versus Ag/AgCl. Besides, photoelectrochemical instability of WS2/p-Si electrodes can be minimized by adding Au coating. Our results suggest that adding the Au-WS2 on p-Si can benefit carrier separation and providing physical protection of the Si layer. Therefore, it can further improve the overall photocatalytic activity and stability.

Abstract: In this paper we show the results from indoor and outdoor measurements on solar cells and modules, manufactured with different bifacial and monofacial cell architectures and encapsulated in different configurations. Reflection/transmission, IV and IQE spectra of single-cell laminates were measured and used to determine the energy spectra for all heat loss and absorption processes, including thermalisation, recombination, entropy generation, parasitic absorption and electrical power generation. From these spectra, the effective heat input was calculated for front, rear and combined irradiance. The power output, bifacial gain and module operating temperature were monitored of single-cell laminates exposed to indoor irradiance as well as of full-size modules installed on our rooftop. We have found that the effective heat input for bifacial glass-glass modules is increasingly larger with increasing rear irradiance compared to monofacial modules. Measured temperatures of rooftop-installed modules strongly indicate that the effective heat transfer coefficient of glass-glass modules is higher than that of white back sheet modules. The observed combined effect of heat input and heat transfer is that only at rear irradiance fractions beyond 15% the additional heat input can cause the bifacial modules to be hotter than their monofacial counterpart, but the energy yield is still much higher due to the large bifacial gain. In the case of moderate albedo, the bifacial energy gain is not accompanied by a higher temperature of the bifacial module compared to the monofacial module.

Abstract: Laplacian photoluminescence-based local diode voltage evaluation was shown recently to lead to correct mean values of the local saturation current density in mm-sized regions, but local maxima in the positions of recombination-active grain boundaries appear overestimated. It is shown here by 2-D device simulations that this effect is at least partly due to the influence of the local diode back voltage, which is caused by the voltage drop at the bulk and back contact resistances. Visually the image of this back voltage appears like a blurred copy of the local diode current density. It is shown in this work that indeed the diode back voltage can be simulated in good approximation by blurring the diode current image, which comes out of the Laplacian evaluation, multiplied with an effective vertical bulk resistance. The corresponding point spread function can be obtained e.g. by device simulation. An iterative procedure is proposed leading to self-consistent results for the diode current density and the diode back voltage. If this method is applied to simulated local cell data, the assumed distribution of the saturation current density is retrieved accurately. Applying this method to measured photoluminescence images leads to a better correspondence to non-linear Fuyuki PL evaluation results than the previously performed direct evaluation of the local diode voltage data. Remaining differences will be discussed.

Abstract: Many diseases are associated with the abnormal activation of NF-κB and its signaling pathway. NF-κB has become an important target for disease treatment and development of new drugs. Many various NF-κB inhibitors were therefore developed; however, they have difficulties to become clinical drugs due to their adverse side effects resulted from the affected normal physiological functions of this transcription factor. To overcome this limitation, this study construct a transgenic vector that can express an artificial miRNA targeting NF-κB RelA under the control of a NF-κB-specific promoter. The promoter consists of a NF-κB decoy and a minimal promoter. The vector was named as decoy minimal promoter-artificial microRNA (DMP-amiRNA). This study verified that this vector can sense and control the intracellular NF-κB activity upon transfection. Working of the vector forms a perfect feedback loop that realizes the NF-κB self-control. With the vector in cells, the higher NF-κB activity, the higher DMP transcriptional activity, and the more amiR533 expression. DMP-amiRNA can moderately inhibit the intracellular NF-κB activity but exert no significant effect on cell viability. This study therefore develops a new strategy for inhibiting over activity of NF-κB, which should has great potential in clinical application.

Abstract: Electrical, optical and structural properties, based on blend of PBDTTT-EFT:PC71BM bulk heterojunction solar cell is investigated. We have shown the presence of PC71BM in the blend facilitates interfaces for charge transfer mechanisms leading to PCEs of ~ 9.38%. GIXRD line profile obtained reveals that quantitative presence of PC71BM initiates a change in preferred orientation. It is proposed that PC71BM facilitates polymer alkyl side chain intercalations causing reduced d100 spacing, leading to larger π-π stacking of the back bone. The data obtained from d200 plane associated with PC71BM, reveals correlation between increased vertical stacking and PC71BM loading, suggesting a bicontinuous network for electron transport. Raman spectroscopy results provides evidence of PC71BM impact on frequency shift associated with C = C stretching mode of side chain thiophene rings responsible for of π-π spacing. Correlations between AFM surface roughness and blend ratio reveals migration of PC71BM to the film surface.

Abstract: In this work, colloidal CdSe QDs capped with a short chain thiol ligand thioglycolic acid (TGA) were prepared using a one-pot synthesis route in aqueous medium. This method integrates colloidal QDs synthesis and assembly of QDs in a single step due to the use of TGA, which serves as a stabilizer to control the formation of QDs and a linker to tether CdSe QDs to TiO2 during the synthesis of QDs, and it could achieve high surface coverage of high-quality QDs on TiO2 electrodes. The hydrothermal temperature is found to play an important role in determining the size of CdSe QDs and photovoltaic properties of the resulting TiO2/CdSe photoanodes. To further improve the fill factor and efficiency of solar cells, PbS/CuS films were prepared with chemical bath deposition method and used instead of the usual Pt as counter electrodes (CEs). PbS/CuS CEs show superior electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of polysulfide than Pt. An optimized TiO2/CdSe based QDSSC in combination with the PbS/CuS CEs achieved a champion PCE of 4.18% under one sun illumination (100mWcm−2).

Abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the activation of estrogen receptors on expression and localization of N-cadherin, E-cadherin and non-phosphorylated β-catenin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and DU-145) and in human post pubertal prostate epithelial cells (PNT1A). Expression of N-cadherin was detected in PNT1A and PC-3 cells, but not in DU-145 cells. E-cadherin was detected only in DU-145 cells and β-catenin was detected in all cells studied. N-cadherin and β-catenin were located preferentially in the cellular membrane of PNT1A cells and in the cytoplasm of PC-3 cells. E-cadherin and β-catenin were located preferentially in the cellular membrane of DU-145 cells. 17β-estradiol (E2) or the ERα-selective agonist PPT did not affect the content and localization of N-cadherin in PC-3 and PNT1A cells or E-cadherin in DU-145 cells. In PC-3 cells, ERβ-selective agonist DPN decreased the expression of N-cadherin. DPN-induced downregulation of N-cadherin was blocked by pretreatment with the ERβ-selective antagonist (PHTPP), indicating that ERβ1 is the upstream receptor regulating the expression of N-cadherin. In DU-145 cells, the activation of ERβ1 by DPN increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of ERβ1 is required to maintain an epithelial phenotype in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. The activation of ERβ1 also increased the expression of β-catenin in cytoplasm of PC-3 and in the cellular membrane of DU-145 cells. In conclusion, our results indicate differential expression and localization of N-cadherin, E-cadherin and β-catenin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. The reduction of N-cadherin content by activation of ERβ, exclusively observed in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (PC-3), may be related to the activation of signaling pathways, such as the release of β-catenin into the cytoplasm, translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus and activation of gene transcription.

Abstract: Atomically thin 2D layered semiconductor materials such as Transition Metal Di-Chalcogenides (TMDCs) have great potential for use as flexible, ultra-thin photovoltaic materials in solar cells due to their favorable photon absorption and electronic transport properties. The electronic properties, such as band structure and bandgap, and optical absorption properties of Tungsten Disulfide (WS2) were obtained from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations; the properties of WS2 make it a favorable photovoltaic material. Using these properties, we have modelled, using numerical calculations and simulations, a solar cell based on monolayer and bulk WS2 together with amorphous silicon (a-Si). The maximum efficiency of this cell is 23.26% with VOC of 0.843V and JSC of 33.49mA/cm2. The performance of our solar cell is comparable to many commercial cells. The results show how monolayer WS2 can serve as a suitable photovoltaic material, opening possibilities to develop solar cells based on 2D TMDC materials.

Abstract: In this work, we present new insight into the multi-crystalline silicon carrier-induced defect (CID) by performing multiple degradation and regeneration cycles and further investigation on the partial recovery of mc-CID through extended dark annealing (DA). The maximum normalised defect density was found to decay exponentially with the number of cycles, suggesting that the defect precursors were slowly depleted by DA. A four-state kinetic model is proposed by introducing a reservoir state. Simulation results generated by mathematical modelling based on the proposed state diagrams exhibited good agreement with the experimental results. Extended DA on a partially recovered sample combined with simulation results suggests that the capability of defect formation through DA and the existence of the reservoir state proposed herein were the root causes for the partial recovery reported in the literature. Finally, the change in bound hydrogen state is speculated to cause the modulation of mc-CID formation. A qualitative reservoir model based on the interaction between hydrogen molecules (H2), boron-hydrogen pairs (B-H) and free hydrogen (H+, H°) is proposed and further discussed.

Abstract: Background
The genetic background plays an important role in thrombosis and pregnancy morbidities. Low levels of protein Z is associated with increased risk of thrombosis. The G79A polymorphism in the protein Z gene may be a genetic risk factor for thrombosis.
Aim of the study
To investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of the protein Z-79 G/A gene polymorphism in Egyptian patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
Methods
We genotyped 60 APS patients and 41 controls, for protein Z-79 G/A gene polymorphism using the PCR-restriction fragment length. The polymorphism was then analyzed in relation to thrombosis and pregnancy morbidities in APS patients.
Results
We observed a higher prevalence of the A allele in the controls when compared to the APS patients (P Value = <0.001). In our studied sample, the G79A polymorphism, as well as its minor A allele, were not associated with an increased risk of thrombosis or pregnancy morbidities in APS.
Conclusion
Protein Z-79 G/A gene polymorphism may be of a protective value against thrombosis in APS. The G79A polymorphism of protein Z was not found to be an independent risk factor of thrombosis in APS.

Abstract: CuGaS2 thin films were obtained by sulfurization of CuGaSe2. CuGaSe2 thin films were first electrodeposited from aqueous solutions containing CuCl2, GaCl3, and H2SeO3 and subsequently annealed at 400°C for 10min in forming gas atmosphere and in the presence of molecular sulfur. This sulfurization process resulted in the complete conversion of CuGaSe2 into CuGaS2. The formation of CuGaS2 was proven by X-Ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy. Diffraction peaks of CuGaS2 shifted to higher angles than those observed for CuGaSe2 films, and the optical band gap shifted to blue rising from 1.66eV for CuGaSe2 to 2.2eV for CuGaS2. When Cr ions were added to the initial electrolyte, the final CuGaS2 films exhibited a broad in-gap absorption band centred at 1.63eV that can be attributed to Cr atoms at the Ga sites. The performance of solar cells based on CuGaS2:Cr absorbers containing an in-gap absorption band was then estimated by numerical simulation using Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator Software. Both quantum efficiency and short circuit current of simulated Mo/CuGaS2:Cr/CdS/ZnO solar cells rose proportionally to the amount of Cr present in the CuGaS2:Cr absorbers. As a result, the photo conversion efficiency of the simulated devices changed from 14.7% for CuGaS2 to 34% for CuGaS2:Cr absorbers. Nevertheless, when neutral defects related to Cr-doping were introduced in the absorber layer, the positive effect of the enhancement of photon harvesting due to IGB was compensated by a decline in the carrier collection and the overall efficiency of the device diminished considerably.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is associated with worst prognosis compared with other aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. However, recent trials have demonstrated that long-term progression-free survival can be achieved by immunochemotherapy. Our goal is to present our experience in aggressive PCNSL in this study.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated the clinical features and management of 13 PCNSL patients who were diagnosed and treated between 2006 and 2015.
Results
Nine patients received rituximab (R) 375mg/m2/day on Day 1, methotrexate (MTX) 3.5g/m2/day and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) 4.4g/m2/day on Day 2, as well as ARA-C 4.4g/m2/day on Day 3 every 28days, and underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. Two patients received procarbazine instead of ARA-C. One patient relapsed, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed. All nine patients are followed in complete remission. Two of 13 patients received one course of MTX and 36–45Gy radiotherapy and died. One patient with renal transplantation had progressive disease and died. Grade 3–4 hematological toxicity was detected in 11 (85%), Grade 3–4 mucositis in 11 (85%), and febrile neutropenia in 12 (92%) patients. The median overall survival in the R–MTX–ARA-C/procarbazine group was 28±16months.
Conclusion
R–MTX–ARA-C followed by autologous stem cell transplantation seems a promising strategy with high response rates in PCNSL.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells are considered as an up-and-coming substitute for the next generation solar cells. Despite of significant increase of its photon-electric conversion efficiency, a definitive direction for further increment remains ambiguous. In this paper, we quantitatively assess the energy losses in planar perovskite solar cells in terms of the underlying physical mechanisms. The coupled optical and electrical modeling is developed to explore the working principle of the perovskite solar cells. A comparison between simulation results and experimental data under different operating conditions is investigated to elucidate the reliability of the device modeling. With the aid of the accurate device modeling, we explore the energy loss mechanisms in planar perovskite solar cells. Five energy loss mechanisms are quantified, such as thermalization loss, below bandgap loss, optical loss, recombination loss, and spatial relaxation loss. The effects of the optical properties, carrier diffusion length, surface recombination velocity, and series resistance on the performance of the perovskite solar cells are analyzed to identify the dominant loss contributors limiting the power conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells. Our results indicate that more efforts should be paid to enhance the optical absorption of the perovskite layer, improve the surface passivation, and reduce the series resistance. Based on the theoretical analysis, a roadmap to promote the device performance of the perovskite solar cells is summarized. Our work provides a detail guideline for design and innovation of perovskite-based device.

Abstract: A new structure for a switchable mirror device based on reversible electrodeposition is proposed. This device does not contain Cu ions in the electrolyte and adapts a counter electrode. The feasibility of the device was evaluated with a WO3 film, which is a well-known electrochromic material, as a counter electrode. Even in the absence of Cu ions, the WO3 film facilitates a clean erase feature in the device. Furthermore, using a pre-deposited Ag film as a working electrode, Ag deposition can be driven at a substantially lower voltage than that in conventional devices. Moreover the deposition current decreases with the progress of Ag deposition, and stops after completion of the deposition process. The results clearly indicate that the tri-bromine ion, which makes the self-erasing circulation, is not generated during Ag deposition process. The new switchable mirror shows excellent bistability and size scale-up is possible because it does not consume continuous current in the mirror state. By appling the proposed technology, a switchable mirror device with a 7cm × 9cm active area was successfully fabricated.

Abstract: In this study, we present detailed theoretical and experimental investigations on full-area alloying from screen-printed aluminum pastes on silicon surfaces for solar cell applications. We introduce a simple analytical model for the description of the alloying process derived from existing models for evaporated Al layers, which we adapt to printed Al pastes. Thereby, we particularly account for the recrystallization of Si within the paste particles, which we refer to as parasitic Si recrystallization. Applying our model, we demonstrate good accordance of calculated with measured eutectic layer thicknesses. We show that the model can be versatilely used to investigate screen-printed Al-alloyed contacts in detail: We demonstrate that the latent heat of the Al paste significantly influences the alloying process. Thus, the effective peak temperature of the alloying process can be several 100°C below the set peak temperature of the firing furnace. By combining calculations of the effective peak temperature with measurements of the Al doping concentration, we determine a parameterization of the solid solubility of Al in Si down to the eutectic temperature of 577°C. Our investigations therefore provide improved understanding of alloying from printed Al pastes and enable the specific optimization of Al-alloyed contacts.

Abstract: A pale-yellow color nano pigment Bi4Ti3O12 (BTO) with impressive infrared (IR) reflectance (R = 95%) was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method and characterized its crystalline nature, structural property, morphology and optical properties using X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer. The Near infrared (NIR) reflectance was measured using UV–Vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer at a wavelength range of 700–2500nm. The band gap of the synthesized BTO nano pigment increases from 2.74 to 3.05eV by increasing the calcination temperature from 600°C to 800°C. For comparison study, the IR reflectance property and the thermal performance of synthesized BTO nano pigment was compared with the conventional infrared reflective white pigment TiO2. The BTO nano pigment shows higher NIR reflectance property and better thermal performance than the TiO2 pigment. The potential application of the BTO nano pigment as the “cool pigment” was also demonstrated by coating on to the steel substrate for the energy saving application.

Abstract: The increasing interest in future energy storage technologies has generated the urgent need for alternative rechargeable batteries. Density functional theory calculations (DFT), including van der Waals interactions, have been carried out in order to evaluate the prospects of a novel 2D material named phosphorene as an anode material for Li, Na and Mg-ion batteries. We determined the binding energies and diffusion barriers on a phosphorene monolayer. Our results show that at low coverage, the adatoms bind strongly on phosphorene with a significant charge transfer. After lithiation of phosphorene, a semiconductor-to-conductor transition is observed. We also found that a single adatom diffuses more easily along the open channel (zigzag direction)than across channels (armchair direction). For example, our result for the diffusion of Na on phosphorene shows a low diffusion barrier value of 0.04 eV along the zigzag direction against 0.30 eV along the armchair direction. The findings of our study suggest that phosphorene could make a good candidate as an anode material for different rechargeable batteries.

Abstract: In this work, we have demonstrated the extreme radiation hardness of thin film CZTSSe solar cells. Thin film solar cells with CZTSSe, CZTS and CIGS absorber layers were irradiated with 3 MeV protons. No degradation in device parameters was observed until a displacement damage dose of 2 × 1010 MeV/g for CZTS and CZTSSe. CIGS solar cells degraded by 13% at the same dose. For the highest proton dose both the CZTSSe and CZTS degraded by 16% while CIGS suffered from 34% degradation in efficiency. The degradation in efficiency maybe attributed to the reduction in the minority carrier lifetime due to radiation induced lattice defects. Comparisons with previously available literature show that our CZTS technology has superior radiation hardness by about two orders of magnitude compared to existing state of the art Si and GaAs technology.

Abstract: CacyBP/SIP interacts with Hsp90 and is able to protect proteins from denaturation and/or aggregation induced by elevated temperature. In this work we studied the influence of different stress factors on CacyBP/SIP level in HEp-2 cells. We have found that H2O2 and radicicol treatment resulted in a significant increase (up to 40%) in the CacyBP/SIP level. We have also found that HEp-2 cells overexpressing CacyBP/SIP were more resistant to stress-induced death. Further studies have revealed that the Hsf1 transcription factor binds to the CacyBP/SIP gene promoter and up-regulates CacyBP/SIP expression under stress conditions. To check whether the CacyBP/SIP protein might play a role in stress responses in vivo, we analyzed its level in selected brain structures of control and stressed mice. We have found that the level of the CacyBP/SIP protein was higher in the thalamus/hypothalamus, hippocampus and brainstem of stressed mice. Thus, the presented results clearly indicate that CacyBP/SIP is involved in cellular stress response.

Abstract: Perovskite photovoltaic solar cells and modules can be manufactured using roll-to-roll (R2R) techniques, which have the potential for very low cost production. Understanding cost barriers and drivers that will impact its future commercial viability can beneficially guide research directions. Because processes, materials and equipment for manufacturing are still under development, it is difficult to estimate these costs accurately. We use a cost method developed to allow for uncertainty in the input assumptions to analyse three demonstrated R2R compatible manufacturing sequences and two potential optimised sequences. Using these novel methods, we have identified and quantified key cost barriers; high cost materials P3HT and PCBM, the use of evaporation for the rear metal deposition, and the transparent ITO coating. We project that technology developments in these key areas would halve the expected manufacturing cost to US$37/m±30%. With 68% GFF, 10% PCE and a 3 year lifetime, such R2R perovskite modules would be competitive with existing flexible PV products in the market on a $/W and power to weight basis. To compete with Si and CdTe in the flat plate PV market, PCE and lifetimes in excess of 15% and 15 years respectively would be required.

Abstract: A novel photovoltaic/radiative cooling (PV/RC) hybrid system based on a selective plate is proposed. This system can generate electricity via diurnal PV conversion and obtain cooling energy by radiative cooling. We introduce a comprehensive photonic approach to simultaneously reduce impractical solar radiation absorption of the selective plate and enhance its thermal radiation for the hybrid system. Initially, we design a photonic structure made of 1D multilayer stack and 2D photonic crystal, which can selectively reflect solar radiation and actively radiate heat to the outer space while maintaining its solar transmission in PV conversion band (0.3–1.1µm). Then, we demonstrate that applying the photonic structure to a monocrystalline silicon solar cell can obtain a diurnal electricity output of 99.2Wm−2 and generate a nocturnal RC power by 128.5Wm−2, indicating 6.9% and 30.5% higher than those of a bare cell. In addition, the potential cooling energy obtained is far more in this structure than in existing RC emitters, including daytime RC emitter reported in a recent research. Results indicate that a comprehensive photonic approach can be used to design spectral selective structures for advancing the applications of exploiting solar energy harvesting and radiative cooling utilization.

Abstract: The hole-transporting materials (HTMs) play an important role in energy conversion process of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, two spiro-OMeTAD derivatives, 2,4-spiro-OMeTAD and 3,4-spiro-OMeTAD with asymmetric methoxy substituents, have been designed, synthesized and fully characterized. Optimization of the positions of the two methoxy substituents in each of the quadrants was proved to be able to adjust the electronic and optical properties of the HTMs, as investigated by cyclic voltammetry and UV/vis spectroscopy. In particular, PSC devices based on 2,4-spiro-OMeTAD exhibited highly improved photovoltaic performance showing an overall conversion efficiency of 17.2% with excellent stability, which is higher than that of the device derived from spiro-OMeTAD (15.0%) under the same conditions. Besides, 3,4-spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs only achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.1%, demonstrating a huge influence of HTM structure on the cell performance.

Abstract: The m-Erythritol (erythritol, ME)/D-mannitol (mannitol, DM) binary system was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the phase diagram was then obtained. It was found that the eutectic composition was at the mole fraction of erythritol xME = 0.87. The latent heat of fusion (ΔmH) of the eutectic mixture was 322.8J/g with a peak melting temperature (Tp, m) of 114.4°C. A cyclic DSC experiment revealed that the ΔmH of the eutectic mixture slightly decreased, and the Tp, m remained stable over 50 DSC cycles. Exfoliated graphite (EG) was then applied to absorb the eutectic mixture to obtain the EG/eutectic composite form-stable phase change material (PCM) and enhance its thermal conductivity. Good form stability could be obtained when the loading of EG in the EG/eutectic composite reached 2.0wt%. The thermal conductivity of the eutectic mixture was greatly enhanced by EG. When the loading of EG was 10.0wt%, the thermal conductivity increased by 408% compared to that of the eutectic mixture. Additionally, severe supercooling of the eutectic mixture was also greatly alleviated by EG. The best result was obtained when 3.0wt% EG was added, for which the degree of supercooling (ΔT) was 62.6°C and the heat of crystallization (ΔcrH) was 185.7J/g. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments revealed that the eutectic mixture was simply a physical mixture of erythritol and mannitol. Thermal gravimetry (TG) investigations showed that the eutectic mixture and the EG/eutectic composite form-stable PCM exhibited good thermal stability for its applications.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, characterized by articular cartilage degradation and changes in all other joint tissues. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in mediating the main risk factors for OA. This study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-26a/26b on the proliferation and apoptosis of human chondrocytes by targeting fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4) through NF-κB signaling pathway. We revealed the differential expression profiles of FUT4 and miR-26a/26b in the articular cartilage tissues of OA patients and normal people. The ability of miR-26a/26b to specifically interact with the 3′UTR of FUT4 was demonstrated via a luciferase reporter assay in chondrocytes. Further results showed altered levels of miR-26a/26b and FUT4 could regulate the process of IL-1β-induced extracellular matrix degradation in chondrocytes. Forced miR-26a/26b expression was able to affect chondrocytes proliferation and apoptosis, while altered expression of FUT4 in chondrocytes modulated progression upon transfection with miR-26a/26b mimic or inhibitor. In OA mice, the overexpression of miR-26a/26b by intra-articular injection significantly attenuated OA progression. In addition, regulating FUT4 expression markedly modulated the activity of NF-κB signaling pathway, and this effect could be reversed by miR-26a/26b. In short, miR-26a/-26b/FUT4/NF-κB axis may serve as a predictive biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in OA treatment.

Abstract: The charge carrier transport mechanism of passivating contacts which feature an ultra-thin oxide layer is investigated by studying temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristics. 4-Terminal dark J-V measurements at low temperatures reveal non-linear J-V characteristics of passivating contacts with a homogeneously grown silicon oxide, which result in an exponential increase in contact resistance towards lower temperature. The attempt to describe the R(T) characteristic solely by thermionic emission of charge carriers across an energy barrier leads to a significant underestimation of the resistance by several orders of magnitude. However, the data can be described properly with the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) theory if tunneling of charge carriers through the silicon oxide layer is taken into account. Furthermore, temperature-dependent light J-V characteristics of solar cells featuring passivating contacts at the rear revealed a FF drop at T < 205K, which is near the onset temperature of the exponential increase in contact resistivity.

Abstract: Potential induced degradation could considerably decrease the performance of photovoltaic systems which operate at high DC voltages. Nonetheless, methodologies for dealing with it in field are not clearly yet defined. This work explains the kinetics of this phenomenon in the field and presents an assessment of its occurrence, detection and prediction in real PV installations. Measurements of the instantaneous operating voltages of the photovoltaic module as a verification routine and predictive maintenance is proposed here as a reasonable and most accurate way of analyzing the actual power losses of the photovoltaic system related to this kind of degradation, as well as detecting and predicting it. Potential induced degradation prevention and recovery have also been carried out by the application of reverse voltage during the night, showing the validity of this technique. A literature review for the PID dynamics of different kinds of photovoltaic cell technologies and development of PID test methodologies and standards is also presented.

Abstract: In the current work, the results of the in situ Raman monitoring of phase formation of copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) material from room temperature up to 350°C are presented. Cu-Zn-Sn oxide precursors were sulfurized for up to 180min using a 100ppm H2S+4%H2+N2 gas mixture (by volume). The results showed that CZTS phase formed in about 30min via a reaction between the metal oxide precursor film and the H2S-H2 gas mixture at intermediate temperature of 350°C and remained stable upon extended exposure. In comparison, at lower temperature such as 170°C, the oxide precursor film had to be reduced first (e.g., in 4% H2+N2 forming gas) and then the CZTS phase emerged. However, continued sulfurization at lower temperature (e.g., 170°C) led to the disintegration of CZTS and the formation of CuS impurity, which remains stable upon cooling the sample down to room temperature. The correlation between the in situ Raman monitoring data and the information from other ex situ characterization techniques provided useful information regarding the reaction pathways leading to the formation of sol-gel based CZTS thin films as well as other related phases under different sulfurization conditions. The outcomes of the current study also set the directions for optimizing the CZTS film structure and stoichiometry toward developing high performance CZTS solar cells in future.

Abstract: A new methodology has been developed to evaluate cleaning efficiency of dust particles on solar panels. Those particles have an average diameter of 2.3µm and were collected in Doha, Qatar. A brush-disk configuration was constructed to measure the sweeping force as a polymeric tip sliding through a dusted glass substrate. The sweeping force was measured under various applied loads on samples treated in environment of various humidity. Experimental results showed that the cleaning efficiency of dry dust particles was independent of the applied load, reaching higher than 90%. However, the adsorption of water molecules showed pronounced effects on the cleaning efficiency. In order to increase the efficiency in humid environment, the applied load thus needed to be increased. The higher the applied load, the higher the sweeping force, the higher the cleaning efficiency, indicating more power is needed to clean the surface. This research presented an alternative approach to evaluate the cleaning efficiency of dust particles.

Abstract: A variety of approaches is being used to fabricate kesterite absorbers, such as sputtering, co-evaporation and solution based techniques. Annealing at high temperatures is a common processing step to stimulate elemental mixing and grain growth. This study investigates the effect of pre-annealing of metal stack precursors at 150 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C and 450 °C on kesterite absorber and solar cell properties. Structural, morphological and vibrational properties of the thin films were investigated. It was found that pre-annealing at 450 °C exhibited a structural mixture distinct from precursors annealed at lower temperatures. The absorber showed improved thickness uniformity, compositional surface homogeneity and absence of Sn-S phases. Lower temperatures resulted in Sn-S compounds in the absorber. In situ XRD is used to monitor phase transitions during pre-annealing. It is shown that implementing a pre-annealing step can improve the absorber properties and the device efficiency. The best performing solar cell had a 4.02% efficiency and was achieved by pre-annealing the precursor layer at 450 °C.

Abstract: In this work, a novel aqueous self-dispersed TiO2 is synthesized and then used to produce the highly water-dispersed ATO/TiO2 composite particles, which has strong IR insulation property. Thus, it can be used to block the solar radiative heat transfer in a building. The primary particle size of ATO/TiO2 composites detected by TEM ranges from 5 to 12nm, but that of the initial ATO nano particles is more than 2µm. A small amount of TiO2 (16.7% wt) increases the Zeta potential in water from 6.7 to 37.01mV, which represents the stability is largely enhanced. The IR transmittance in IR band is decreased from 91% (original glass) to 4.3% (ATO 83.33% wt). The thermal performances of glass with such coatings are simulated based on Hong Kong climate situation. For the best sample, the electricity used in air-conditioning and lighting is 27% less than uncoated glass. Furthermore, the TiO2 makes the water contact angle of the coating ranging from 3 to 5.6°. Therefore, the coating film can be prevented from fouling due to super-hydrophilicity and have a longer life time.

Abstract: A novel excellent carbon-H2O nanofluid, nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon, has been discovered and prepared by using a facile metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived synthesis method. The obtained ZIF-8 (ZIF denotes zeolitic imidazolate framework) derived nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (ZNG) analogs have high specific surface area of 580.2 m2 g−1 and show broad band absorption across the visible and near-infrared region. Au nanoparticles with the size of 2–5 nm are facilely and successfully deposited on the surface of nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (Au/ZNG) via an impregnation-reduction method. The photothermal conversion tests indicate that both ZNG-H2O and Au/ZNG-H2O nanofluids show better photo-thermal performance and more awesome dispersion stability in water than conventional carbon nanofluids such as graphene and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. Just as expected, Au/ZNG nanofluid shows obvious enhancement in photo-thermal performance due to the synergistic effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) Au nanoparticles and ZNG. This novel ZNG/water nanofluid is very attractive in working fluids for direct absorption solar collectors.

Abstract: Transparent dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) can be coupled within a building's architecture to provide daylighting and electrical power simultaneously. In this work, the relationship between the transparency and performance of DSSCs is studied by changing the TiO2 electrode thickness. The 10µm thickness device shows a power conversion efficiency of 5.93% and a Jsc of 12.75mA/cm2 with 37% transparency in the visible range. However, the performance loss in DSSCs during the scale up process is a potential drawback. This can be addressed using an optical concentrator with DSSC to generate more power from small size devices. Here, a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) is coupled with DSSCs and its performance is compared to a scaled-up device (approx. 4 times). Furthermore, the impact of operating temperature on the performance of the bare and concentrator-coupled devices is discussed in this article. An increase of 67% in power conversion efficiency is observed at 36°C for the concentrator-coupled device under 1000W/m2 illumination. Maximum Jsc of 25.55mA/cm2 is achieved at 40°C for the concentrated coupled device compare with the Jsc of 13.06mA/cm2 for the bare cell at the same temperature.
