Abstract: Summary
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent plasma antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of plasma neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal plasma antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but longitudinal samples reveal that the impact of these mutations on antibody binding varies substantially both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD’s receptor-binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some plasma is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in the emerging 20H/501Y.V2 and 20J/501Y.V3 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Going forward, these plasma escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Abstract: Insulin mimetics, including zinc containing compounds, have previously been shown to influence chondrogenesis as it relates to healing of fractures in various preclinical models. However, the mechanism by which these compounds drive chondrogenic differentiation is yet undefined. Here, via next-generation sequencing (NGS) and in vitro functional validation, we show that Zinc Chloride (ZnCl2) induces expression of both chondrogenic genes (Sox9, Runx1, collagen) as well as genes associated with VEGF-mediated signal transduction, including VEGF receptors 1 and 2 and their ligands; VEGF-A and VEGF-B. Noticeably, although insulin was able to also induce expression of these pro-angiogenic and pro-chondrogenic genes, the impact of insulin on expression of VEGF receptor and ligand genes was marginal when compared to that of ZnCl2. Furthermore, while the VEGFR antagonist, Axitinib, was able to attenuate the pro-chondrogenic effects of both insulin and ZnCl2; a reduction in gene and protein expression was most profoundly observed when the antagonist was applied to cells treated with ZnCl2. Taken together, these data suggest an important role for the VEGF-mediated signal transduction pathways in the positive effects observed when applying zinc-based compounds as adjuvants for chondrogenesis-mediated fracture healing. In this regard, further mechanistic evaluation of ZnCl2 and other zinc-containing insulin mimetics may support rational design of therapies targeted for disease indications associated with impaired fracture healing.

Abstract: Structurally-reduced cells and cell-derived structures are powerful tools for membrane studies. Using this approach, we probed whether a cell, without its nucleus and cytoplasm, is still capable of undergoing CD4-mediated membrane fusion. For this, we needed a cell-derived structure, akin to a giant liposome functionalised with CD4 and chemokine receptors. We present a method for the simultaneous removal of cytoplasmic and nuclear material from cells presenting CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4, using Colcemid treatment followed by hypotonic cytolysis, and then enriched using preparative flow cytometry. We show that the resultant cell membrane remains intact, retains presentation of CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4, and is still capable of CD4-mediated membrane fusion with a target cell. Finally, we detail how this protocol was developed, as well as how such samples should be handled for storage and assays. We envision the use of such systems for host-pathogen interaction studies, and the development of targeted delivery vehicles.

Abstract: Recombinant matrices have enabled feeder cell-free maintenance cultures of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), with laminin 511-E8 fragment (LM511-E8) being widely used. However, we herein report that hPSCs maintained on LM511-E8 resist differentiating to multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), unlike hPSCs maintained on LM421-E8 or LM121-E8. The latter two LM-E8s bound weakly to hPSCs compared with LM511-E8 and activated the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, the extracellular LM-E8-dependent preferential hematopoiesis was associated with a higher expression of integrin β1 (ITGB1) and downstream integrin-linked protein kinase (ILK), β-catenin and phosphorylated JUN. Accordingly, the lower coating concentration of LM511-E8 or addition of a Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator, CHIR99021, facilitated higher HPC yield. In contrast, the inhibition of ILK, Wnt or JNK by inhibitors or mRNA knockdown suppressed the HPC yield. These findings suggest that extracellular laminin scaffolds modulate the hematopoietic differentiation potential of hPSCs by activating the ITGB1-ILK-β-catenin-JUN axis at the undifferentiated stage. Finally, the combination of low-concentrated LM511-E8 and a revised hPSC-sac method, which adds bFGF, SB431542 and heparin to the conventional method, enabled a higher yield of HPCs and higher rate for definitive hematopoiesis, suggesting a useful protocol for obtaining differentiated hematopoietic cells from hPSCs in general.

Abstract: The Egyptian cotton leaf worm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.), is a major agricultural lepidopterous pest causing extensive damage in a variety of crops including vegetable, cotton, fodder, and fiber crops. Heat shock protein (HSP) family members play important roles in protecting insects against environmental stressors. In this study, we characterized three putative heat shock proteins (SpliHsp70, SpliHsp90, and SpliHSF) from S. littoralis and analyzed their expression levels in response to heat, cold, ultraviolet irradiation, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus treatments. Significant upregulation of SpliHsp70 was observed in female pupae, while the highest expression levels of SpliHsp90 and SpliHSF were found in female adults. Heat shock triggered increases in SpliHsp levels compared to cold treatment. SpliHsp90 exhibited the highest expression levels during the first 30 min of UV treatment. Both bacterial and viral pathogenic agents effected the regulation of Hsps in S. littoralis. These findings suggest that SpliHsp genes might play significant roles in the response to biotic and abiotic stress, as well as in the regulation of developmental stages.

Abstract: Summary
Three limonoid natural products with selective anti-proliferative activity against BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61K)-mutation-dependent melanoma cell lines were identified. Differential transcriptome analysis revealed dependency of compound activity on expression of the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 oxidase CYP27A1, a transcriptional target of melanogenesis-associated transcription factor (MITF). We determined that CYP27A1 activity is necessary for the generation of a reactive metabolite that proceeds to inhibit cellular proliferation. A genome-wide small interfering RNA screen in combination with chemical proteomics experiments revealed gene-drug functional epistasis, suggesting that these compounds target mitochondrial biogenesis and inhibit tumor bioenergetics through a covalent mechanism. Our work suggests a strategy for melanoma-specific targeting by exploiting the expression of MITF target gene CYP27A1 and inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in BRAF mutant melanomas.

Abstract: Endometrium receptivity and successful implantation require a complex network of regulatory factors whom production is strictly controlled especially at the implantation window. Many regulators like steroid hormones, prostaglandins, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins and downstream cell signalling pathways are involved in the process of embryo-endometrium interaction. Our work reveals the effect of fractalkine (FKN), a unique chemokine on progesterone receptor, SOX-17 and NRF2 expressions in HEC-1A endometrial cell line. FKN activates fractalkine receptor signalling and the expression of SOX-17 through progesterone receptor in HEC-1A endometrial cells, and as a consequence it increases endometrial receptivity. Fractalkine also activates the NRF2-Keap-1 signal transduction pathway regulating the IL-6 and IL-1β cytokine productions, which increase endometrial receptivity, as well. The NRF2 transcription factor increases the expression of the iron exporter ferroportin in HEC-1A cells activating iron release towards JEG-3 trophoblast cells. The iron measurements show that iron content of endometrial cells decreases while heme concentration increases at FKN treatment. At the same time, the trophoblast cells show increased iron uptake and total iron content. Based on our results it seems that FKN enhances the establishment of endometrial receptivity and meanwhile it regulates the iron homeostasis of endometrium contributing to the iron availability of the trophoblast cells and the embryo.

Abstract: Summary
Aggregation can be selectively induced by aggregation-prone regions (APRs) contained in the target proteins. Aggregation-inducing antimicrobial peptides (Pept-ins) contain sequences homologous to APRs of target proteins and exert their bactericidal effect by causing aggregation of a large number of proteins. To better understand the mechanism of action of Pept-ins and the resistance mechanisms, we analyzed the phenotypic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic as well as genotypic changes in laboratory-derived Pept-in-resistant E. coli mutator cells. The analysis showed that the Pept-in resistance mechanism is dominated by a decreased Pept-in uptake, in both laboratory-derived mutator cells and clinical isolates. Our data indicate that Pept-in uptake involves an electrostatic attraction between the Pept-in and the bacterial membrane and follows a complex mechanism potentially involving many transporters. Furthermore, it seems more challenging for bacteria to become resistant toward Pept-ins that are less dependent on electrostatic attraction for uptake, suggesting that future Pept-ins should be selected for this property.

Abstract: Summary
Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a form of pathological cell-fate change of mesenchymal stem/precursor cells (MSCs) that occurs following traumatic injury, limiting range of motion in extremities and causing pain. MSCs have been shown to differentiate to form bone; however, their lineage and aberrant processes after trauma are not well understood. Utilizing a well-established mouse HO model and inducible lineage-tracing mouse (Hoxa11-CreERT2;ROSA26-LSL-TdTomato), we found that Hoxa11-lineage cells represent HO progenitors specifically in the zeugopod. Bioinformatic single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses showed Hoxa11-lineage cells are regionally restricted mesenchymal cells that, after injury, gain the potential to undergo differentiation toward chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and adipocytes. This study identifies Hoxa11-lineage cells as zeugopod-specific ectopic bone progenitors and elucidates the fate specification and multipotency that mesenchymal cells acquire after injury. Furthermore, this highlights homeobox patterning genes as useful tools to trace region-specific progenitors and enable location-specific gene deletion.

Abstract: Summary
Enteroviruses, such as EV-A71 and CVA16, mainly infect the human gastrointestinal tract. Human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have been variably associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. We aimed to optimize the human intestinal organoids and hypothesize that these optimized intestinal organoids can recapitulate enteric infections of enterovirus and coronavirus. We demonstrate that the optimized human intestinal organoids enable better simulation of the native human intestinal epithelium, and that they are significantly more susceptible to EV-A71 than CVA16. Higher replication of EV-A71 than CVA16 in the intestinal organoids triggers a more vigorous cellular response. However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit distinct dynamics of virus-host interaction; more robust propagation of SARS-CoV triggers minimal cellular response, whereas, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits lower replication capacity but elicits a moderate cellular response. Taken together, the disparate profile of the virus-host interaction of enteroviruses and coronaviruses in human intestinal organoids may unravel the cellular basis of the distinct pathogenicity of these viral pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
The formicamycins are promising antibiotics first identified in Streptomyces formicae KY5, which produces the compounds at low levels. Here, we show that by understanding the regulation of the for biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), we can rewire the BGC to increase production levels. The for BGC consists of 24 genes expressed on nine transcripts. The MarR regulator ForJ represses expression of seven transcripts encoding the major biosynthetic genes as well as the ForGF two-component system that initiates biosynthesis. We show that overexpression of forGF in a ΔforJ background increases formicamycin production 10-fold compared with the wild-type. De-repression, by deleting forJ, also switches on biosynthesis in liquid culture and induces the production of additional, previously unreported formicamycin congeners. Furthermore, combining de-repression with mutations in biosynthetic genes leads to biosynthesis of additional bioactive precursors.

Abstract: COVID-19 was declared an international public health emergency in January, and a pandemic in March of 2020. There are over 125 million confirmed COVID-19 cases that have caused over 2.7 million deaths worldwide as of March 2021. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 presents a surface “spike” protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor to infect host cells. In addition to the respiratory tract, SARS-Cov-2 can also infect cells of the oral mucosa, which also express the ACE2 receptor. The spike and ACE2 proteins are highly glycosylated with sialic acid modifications that direct viral-host interactions and infection. Maackia amurensis seed lectin (MASL) has a strong affinity for sialic acid modified proteins and can be used as an antiviral agent. Here, we report that MASL targets the ACE2 receptor, decreases ACE2 expression and glycosylation, suppresses binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and decreases expression of inflammatory mediators by oral epithelial cells that cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we report that MASL also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney epithelial cells in culture. This work identifies MASL as an agent with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related inflammatory syndromes.

Abstract: Summary
The aberrant expression of dopamine receptors (DRDs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells has encouraged the repurposing of DRD antagonists such as thioridazine (TDZ) as anti-leukemic agents. Here, we access patient cells from a Phase I dose escalation trial to resolve the cellular and molecular bases of response to TDZ, and we extend these findings to an additional independent cohort of AML patient samples tested preclinically. We reveal that in DRD2+ AML patients, DRD signaling in leukemic progenitors provides leukemia-exclusive networks of sensitivity that spare healthy hematopoiesis. AML progenitor cell suppression can be increased by the isolation of the positive enantiomer from the racemic TDZ mixture (TDZ+), and this is accompanied by reduced cardiac liability. Our study indicates that the development of DRD-directed therapies provides a targeting strategy for a subset of AML patients and potentially other cancers that acquire DRD expression upon transformation from healthy tissue.

Abstract: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) closely regulate the whole lifecycle of most RNA molecules, from the very early stage of transcription to RNA decay. Dysregulation of RBPs significantly affects the fate of cancer-related transcripts. Therefore, it is imperative to fully understand the complicated RBP-RNA regulatory networks in malignant diseases and to explore novel therapeutic targets. The RBP DAZAP1 (deleted in azoospermia-associated protein 1), originally identified as an important protein in spermatogenesis, had rarely been studied in the context of carcinogenesis. The role of DAZAP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was unveiled in this study. The relative expression of DAZAP1 was significantly upregulated in HCC and was positively associated with several key malignant characteristics and poor postoperative survival in patients. DAZAP1 knockdown by small interfering RNA markedly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, DAZAP1 significantly reduced cellular sensitivity to sorafenib (SF), which had been proven to be an inducer of ferroptosis by targeting the system Xc− (composed of a light chain, xCT/SLC7A11, and a heavy chain, 4F2 heavy chain). At the mechanistic level, DAZAP1 was identified as a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis and an efficient binding partner of SLC7A11 mRNA. Further study revealed that DAZAP1 interacted with the 3′UTR (untranslated region) of SLC7A11 mRNA and positively regulated its stability. In our work, we clarified novel functions of DAZAP1 and preliminarily revealed its underlying mechanism in ferroptosis, which may be conducive to the exploration of biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC patients.

Abstract: Sirtuins are a family of highly conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent enzymes. Among the sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT6 participate in the regulation of endothelial functions and play significant roles in the physiological and pathological processes of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Recently, our study found that minute cholesterol crystals (CC) can be endocytosed by endothelial cells and further impair endothelial functions. Since previous studies have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) involves Angiotensin (Ang) II-induced inflammation in endothelial cells, this study was designed to investigate the role of SIRT1 and SIRT6 in CC-induced variation of ACE2 expression and the related mechanism between SIRT6 and ACE2. We found that ACE2 is involved in CC-induced endothelial dysfunction, which inhibits decreases in nitric oxide (NO) level and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and increases in inflammatory factors and adhesion molecules. Besides, SIRT1 and SIRT6 regulated the protein expression of ACE2 in CC-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, bioinformatics analysis from the Enrichr database indicated that activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), is highly correlated with genes that significantly upregulated after infection with the SIRT6 adenovirus vector. In CC-induced HUVECs, ACE2 expression was up-regulated in cells transfected with ATF2 siRNA. However, further mechanism studies revealed that overexpression of SIRT6 decreases the accumulation of p-ATF2 in the nucleus, but did not affect p-ATF2 expression in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these data indicated that SIRT6 regulates ACE2 might via inhibiting the accumulation of nucleus p-ATF2 in CC-induced endothelial dysfunction.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) is a well-recognized multifunctional protein, playing a substantial role in protecting organisms from environmental stress. The domestic pigeon (Columba livia) is a promising model organism, with important economic and ecological value, and its health is susceptible to temperature stress. To explore the molecular characteristics, tissue expression profile, and response to temperature stress for HSP60 of Columba livia (ClHSP60), we firstly cloned and characterized the complete cDNA sequence and investigated its expression profile under optimal conditions and acute temperature stress. The cDNA of ClHSP60 contained 2257 nucleotides, consisting of 12 exons with length ranging from 65 to 590 bp. The open reading frame (ORF) encoded 573 amino acids with calculated molecular weight of 60.97 kDa that contained a number of structurally prominent domains or motifs. Under optimal temperature conditions, levels of ClHSP60 expression differed between all the tested tissues (the highest was noted in liver and the lowest in pectoralis major muscle). Under acute temperature stress, five patterns of change were detected in the tested tissues, suggesting that different tissues in domestic pigeons differentially responded to various temperature stress conditions. Upregulation of ClHSP60 expression was highest in the lung and pectoralis major muscle, reflecting the crucial role of these two tissues in temperature regulation. However, the crop, cerebrum, and heart showed little change or decreased ClHSP60 expression.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis are currently some of the most widespread diseases of our time. Within cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease and underlying atherosclerosis were recently linked with systemic and local inflammation. Cyclophilins participate in the initiation and progression of these inflammatory-related diseases. Cyclophilins are released into the extracellular space upon inflammatory stimuli and participate in the pathology of cardiovascular diseases. The cell surface receptor for extracellular cyclophilins, the CD147 receptor, also contributes to coronary artery disease pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the physiological relevance of cyclophilin's family and their receptor in cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. The present study aimed to better understand the role of cyclophilins in cardiovascular artery disease and their relationship with inflammation. Hence, cyclophilins and pro-inflammatory interleukins were measured in the serum of 30 subjects (divided into three groups according to coronary artery disease status: 10 patients with acute coronary syndrome, 10 patients with chronic coronary artery disease, and 10 control volunteers). In addition, cyclophilin levels and CD147 receptor expression were measured in T lymphocytes purified from these subjects. Cyclophilin A, B, and C, pro-inflammatory interleukins, and CD147 membrane expression were significantly elevated in patients with coronary artery disease.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a type of nonapoptotic cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. Here, we show a key role of MGST1 in inhibiting ferroptosis in cell cultures and mouse xenograft models. Ferroptosis activators induce MGST1 upregulation in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines in an NFE2L2-dependent manner. The genetic depletion of MGST1 or NFE2L2 has a similar effect in promoting ferroptosis, whereas the re-expression of MGST1 restores the resistance of NFE2L2-knockdown cells to ferroptosis. MGST1 inhibits ferroptotic cancer cell death partly by binding to ALOX5, resulting in reduced lipid peroxidation. The expression of MGST1 is positively correlated with NFE2L2 expression in pancreatic tumors, which is implicated in the poor prognosis of patients with PDAC. These findings not only provide a valuable insight into the defense mechanism against ferroptotic cell death, but also indicate that targeting the MGST1 redox-sensitive pathway may be a promising strategy for the treatment of PDAC.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), an intracellular molecular chaperone, is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer by promoting both tumor cell proliferation and resistance to therapy. HSP27 is also present in the circulation and circulating HSP27 (sHSP27) can elicit an autoimmune response with production of antibodies. Levels of sHSP27 are enhanced in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); it is, however, unknown whether changes in HSP27 antibody levels occur in patients with HCC and can be exploited as a circulating biomarker of HCC. Our aim was to assess the potential association between newly diagnosed HCC and serum anti-HSP27 antibody levels. In this cross-sectional study, anti-HSP27 antibody levels were measured in serum samples from 71 HCC patients, 80 subjects with chronic liver disease, and 38 control subjects by immunoenzymatic assay. Anti-HSP27 antibody levels did not differ significantly among groups. However, in patients with chronic active hepatitis/cirrhosis, anti-HSP27 levels were significantly higher in subjects with a positive history of alcoholism (p = 0.03). Our data do not support the hypothesis that anti-HSP27 antibody levels may help identify patients with HCC among subjects with chronic liver disease. However, our finding that alcohol-related liver disease is associated with higher anti-HSP27 levels is novel and deserves further investigations.

Abstract: Tumor neovascularization may occur via both angiogenic and vasculogenic events. In order to investigate the vessel formation during tumor growth, we developed a novel experimental model that takes into account the differentiative and tumorigenic properties of Embryonic Stem cells (ESCs). Leukemia Inhibitory Factor-deprived murine ESCs were grafted on the top of the chick embryo chorionallantoic membrane (CAM) in ovo. Cell grafts progressively grew, forming a vascularized mass within 10 days. At this stage, the grafts are formed by cells with differentiative features representative of all three germ layers, thus originating teratomas, a germinal cell tumor. In addition, ESC supports neovascular events by recruiting host capillaries from surrounding tissue that infiltrates the tumor mass. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that perfused active blood vessels within the tumor are of both avian and murine origin because of the simultaneous occurrence of angiogenic and vasculogenic events. In conclusion, the chick embryo ESC/CAM-derived teratoma model may represent a useful approach to investigate both vasculogenic and angiogenic events during tumor growth and for the study of natural and synthetic modulators of the two processes.

Abstract: Summary
Organoids (ORGs) are increasingly used as models of cerebral cortical development. Here, we compared transcriptome and cellular phenotypes between telencephalic ORGs and monolayers (MONs) generated in parallel from three biologically distinct induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Multiple readouts revealed increased proliferation in MONs, which was caused by increased integrin signaling. MONs also exhibited altered radial glia (RG) polarity and suppression of Notch signaling, as well as impaired generation of intermediate progenitors, outer RG, and cortical neurons, which were all partially reversed by reaggregation of dissociated cells. Network analyses revealed co-clustering of cell adhesion, Notch-related transcripts and their transcriptional regulators in a module strongly downregulated in MONs. The data suggest that ORGs, with respect to MONs, initiate more efficient Notch signaling in ventricular RG owing to preserved cell adhesion, resulting in subsequent generation of intermediate progenitors and outer RG, in a sequence that recapitulates the cortical ontogenetic process.

Abstract: Dynamic changes in mitochondrial shape and size are vital for mitochondrial health and for tissue development and function. Adult Drosophila indirect flight muscles contain densely packed mitochondria. We show here that mitochondrial fusion is critical during early muscle development (in pupa) and that silencing of the outer mitochondrial membrane fusion gene, Marf, in muscles results in smaller mitochondria that are functionally defective. This leads to abnormal muscle development resulting in muscle dysfunction in adult flies. However, post-developmental silencing of Marf has no obvious effects on mitochondrial and muscle phenotype in adult flies, indicating the importance of mitochondrial fusion during early muscle development.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia have recently been established as key regulators of brain development. However, their role in neuronal subtype specification remains largely unknown. Using three different co-culture setups, we show that microglia-secreted factors enhance dopaminergic differentiation of somatic and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neural stem cells (NSCs). The effect was consistent across different NSC and microglial cell lines and was independent of prior microglial activation, although restricted to microglia of embryonic origin. We provide evidence that the effect is mediated through reduced cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis and necrosis orchestrated in a sequential manner during the differentiation process. tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, and insulinlike growth factor 1 are identified as key mediators of the effect and shown to directly increase dopaminergic differentiation of human NSCs. These findings demonstrate a positive effect of microglia on dopaminergic neurogenesis and may provide new insights into inductive and protective factors that can stimulate in vitro derivation of dopaminergic neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Direct neuronal reprogramming potentially provides valuable sources for cell-based therapies. Proneural gene Ascl1 converts astrocytes into induced neuronal (iN) cells efficiently both in vitro and in vivo. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. By combining RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing, we found that the expression of 1,501 genes was markedly changed during the early stages of Ascl1-induced astrocyte-to-neuron conversion and that the regulatory regions of 107 differentially expressed genes were directly bound by ASCL1. Among Ascl1's direct targets, Klf10 regulates the neuritogenesis of iN cells at the early stage, Myt1 and Myt1l are critical for the electrophysiological maturation of iN cells, and Neurod4 and Chd7 are required for the efficient conversion of astrocytes into neurons. Together, this study provides more insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Ascl1-mediated astrocyte-to-neuron conversion and will be of value for the application of direct neuronal reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Interfacial inhibitors exert their biological effects through co-association with two macromolecules. The pateamine A (PatA) class of molecules function by stabilizing eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A RNA helicase onto RNA, resulting in translation initiation inhibition. Here, we present the crystal structure of an eIF4A1:RNA complex bound to an analog of the marine sponge-derived natural product PatA, C5-desmethyl PatA (DMPatA). One end of this small molecule wedges itself between two RNA bases while the other end is cradled by several protein residues. Strikingly, DMPatA interacts with the eIF4A1:RNA complex in an almost identical fashion as rocaglamide A (RocA), despite being completely unrelated from a structural standpoint. The structural data rationalize the ability of PatA analogs to target a wider range of RNA substrates compared to RocA. We define the molecular basis of how DMPatA is able to clamp eIF4A1 onto RNA, imparting potent inhibitory properties to this molecule.

Abstract: Ischaemic stroke is an acute interruption of the blood supply to the brain, which leads to rapid irreversible damage to nerve tissue. Ischaemic stroke is accompanied by the development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration observed around the affected brain area. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) facilitates cell survival under a variety of different stress conditions. Hsp70 may be secreted from cells and exhibits cytoprotective activity. This activity most likely occurs by decreasing the levels of several proinflammatory cytokines through interaction with a few receptors specific to the innate immune system. Herein, we demonstrated that intranasal administration of recombinant human Hsp70 shows a significant twofold decrease in the volume of local ischaemia induced by photothrombosis in the mouse prefrontal brain cortex. Our results revealed that intranasal injections of recombinant Hsp70 decreased the apoptosis level in the ischaemic penumbra, stimulated axonogenesis and increased the number of neurons producing synaptophysin. Similarly, in the isolated crayfish stretch receptor, consisting of a single sensory neuron surrounded by the glial envelope, exogenous Hsp70 significantly decreased photoinduced apoptosis and necrosis of glial cells. The obtained data enable one to consider human recombinant Hsp70 as a promising compound that could be translated from the bench into clinical therapies.

Abstract: Cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts assemble and maintain extracellular matrix during normal development and following injury. Culture expansion of these cells yield a bioengineered matrix that could lead to intriguing therapeutic opportunities. For example, we reported that cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts form a matrix that can be used to delivery therapeutic stem cells. Furthermore, we reported that matrix derived from cultured human cardiac fibroblasts/myofibroblasts converted monocytes into macrophages that express interesting anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic properties. Expanding these matrix investigations require characterization of the source cells for quality control. In these efforts, we observed and herein report that Sushi Containing Domain 2 (SUSD2) is a novel and consistent marker for cultured human cardiac fibroblast and myofibroblasts.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of cellular proteins involved in a variety of biological functions including chaperone activity. HSPs are classified based on their molecular weight and each family has several isoforms in eukaryotes. HSP40 is the most diverse family acting as a co-chaperone for the highly conserved HSP70 family. Some of the isoforms are reported to be induced during heat stress. Few studies have also highlighted the diverse role of some isoforms in different stress conditions including viral infections. But till date, no study has comprehensively examined the expression profile of different HSP40 and 70 isoforms in either heat stress or HIV-1 infection, a virus that is responsible for the pandemic of AIDS. In the present study, we have compared the mRNA expression profile of HSP40 and HSP70 isoforms during heat stress and HIV-1 infection in a T-cell line and also validated the HIV-1 stress results in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In case of HSP70, we observed that three isoforms (HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA6) are highly upregulated during heat stress, but these isoforms were found to be downregulated during the peak of HIV-1 infection. While in case of HSP40, we found that only DNAJA4, DNAJB1, and DNAJB4 showed significant upregulation during heat stress, whereas in HIV-1 infection, majority of the isoforms were induced significantly. Stress-dependent differential expression observed here indicates that different HSP40 and HSP70 isoforms may have specific roles during HIV-1 infection and thus could be important for future studies.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are a powerful platform for biomedical research. However, they are immature, which is a barrier to modeling adult-onset cardiovascular disease. Here, we sought to develop a simple method that could drive cultured hiPSC-CMs toward maturity across a number of phenotypes, with the aim of utilizing mature hiPSC-CMs to model human cardiovascular disease. hiPSC-CMs were cultured in fatty acid-based medium and plated on micropatterned surfaces. These cells display many characteristics of adult human cardiomyocytes, including elongated cell morphology, sarcomeric maturity, and increased myofibril contractile force. In addition, mature hiPSC-CMs develop pathological hypertrophy, with associated myofibril relaxation defects, in response to either a pro-hypertrophic agent or genetic mutations. The more mature hiPSC-CMs produced by these methods could serve as a useful in vitro platform for characterizing cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Sepsis is a complicated multi-system disorder characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection. Despite substantial progress in the understanding of mechanisms of sepsis, translation of these advances into clinically effective therapies remains challenging. Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) possess immunomodulatory properties that have shown therapeutic promise in preclinical models of sepsis. The therapeutic effects of MSCs may vary depending on the source and type of these cells. In this comparative study, the gene expression pattern and surface markers of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) as well as their therapeutic effects in a clinically relevant mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), were investigated. The results showed remarkable differences in gene expression profile, surface markers and therapeutic potency in terms of enhancing survival and pro/anti-inflammatory responses between the two MSC types. BM-MSCs improved survival concomitant with an enhanced systemic bacterial clearance and improved inflammatory profile post CLP surgery. Despite some improvement in the inflammatory profile of the septic animals, treatment with UC-MSCs did not enhance survival or bacterial clearance. Overall, the beneficial therapeutic effects of BM-MSCs over UC-MSCs may likely be attributed to their pro-inflammatory function, and to some extent anti-inflammatory features, reflected in their gene expression pattern enhancing macrophage polarization to M1/M2 phenotypes resulting in a balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory response against polymicrobial sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
To fight tuberculosis, better vaccination strategies are needed. Live attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived vaccine, MTBVAC, is a promising candidate in the pipeline, proven to be safe and immunogenic in humans so far. Independent studies have shown that pulmonary mucosal delivery of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only tuberculosis (TB) vaccine available today, confers superior protection over standard intradermal immunization. Here we demonstrate that mucosal MTBVAC is well tolerated, eliciting polyfunctional T helper type 17 cells, interleukin-10, and immunoglobulins in the airway and yielding a broader antigenic profile than BCG in rhesus macaques. Beyond our previous work, we show that local immunoglobulins, induced by MTBVAC and BCG, bind to M. tuberculosis and enhance pathogen uptake. Furthermore, after pulmonary vaccination, but not M. tuberculosis infection, local T cells expressed high levels of mucosal homing and tissue residency markers. Our data show that pulmonary MTBVAC administration has the potential to enhance its efficacy and justifies further exploration of mucosal vaccination strategies in preclinical efficacy studies.

Abstract: Summary
Hemorrhagic shock induces an aberrant immune response characterized by simultaneous induction of a proinflammatory state and impaired host defenses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of conditionally immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) on this aberrant immune response. We employed a mouse model of hemorrhagic shock, followed by the adoptive transfer of NPs and subsequent inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus to induce pneumonia. We observed that transplant of NPs decreases the proportion of host neutrophils that express programmed death ligand 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in the context of prior hemorrhage. Following hemorrhage, NP transplant decreased proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs, increased neutrophil migration into the airspaces, and enhanced bacterial clearance. Further, hemorrhagic shock improved NP engraftment in the bone marrow. These results suggest that NPs hold the potential for use as a cellular therapy in the treatment and prevention of secondary infection following hemorrhagic shock.

Abstract: Summary
Quantifying the replication-competent HIV reservoir is essential for evaluating curative strategies. Viral outgrowth assays (VOAs) underestimate the reservoir because they fail to induce all replication-competent proviruses. Single- or double-region HIV DNA assays overestimate it because they fail to exclude many defective proviruses. We designed two triplex droplet digital PCR assays, each with 2 unique targets and 1 in common, and normalize the results to PCR-based T cell counts. Both HIV assays are specific, sensitive, and reproducible. Together, they estimate the number of proviruses containing all five primer-probe regions. Our 5-target results are on average 12.1-fold higher than and correlate with paired quantitative VOA (Spearman's ρ = 0.48) but estimate a markedly smaller reservoir than previous DNA assays. In patients on antiretroviral therapy, decay rates in blood CD4+ T cells are faster for intact than for defective proviruses, and intact provirus frequencies are similar in mucosal and circulating T cells.

Abstract: During the integrated stress response (ISR), global translation initiation is attenuated; however, noncanonical mechanisms allow for the continued translation of specific transcripts. Eukaryotic initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) has been shown to play a critical role in canonical translation as well as in noncanonical mechanisms involving internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and upstream open reading frame (uORF) elements. The uORF-mediated translation regulation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA plays a pivotal role in the cellular ISR. Our recent study confirmed that eIF5B depletion removes uORF2-mediated repression of ATF4 translation, which results in the upregulation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) transcription. Accordingly, we hypothesized that eIF5B depletion may reprogram the transcriptome profile of the cell. Here, we employed genome-wide transcriptional analysis on eIF5B-depleted cells. Further, we validate the up- and downregulation of several transcripts from our RNA-seq data using RT-qPCR. We identified upregulated pathways including cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis, as well as downregulated pathways of transcriptional misregulation in cancer and T cell receptor signaling. We also confirm that depletion of eIF5B leads to activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) arm of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This data suggests that depletion of eIF5B reprograms the cellular transcriptome and influences critical cellular processes such as ER stress and ISR.

Abstract: Summary
Building on the pyrazolopyrimidine CK2 (casein kinase 2) inhibitor scaffold, we designed a small targeted library. Through comprehensive evaluation of inhibitor selectivity, we identified inhibitor 24 (SGC-CK2-1) as a highly potent and cell-active CK2 chemical probe with exclusive selectivity for both human CK2 isoforms. Remarkably, despite years of research pointing to CK2 as a key driver in cancer, our chemical probe did not elicit a broad antiproliferative phenotype in >90% of >140 cell lines when tested in dose-response. While many publications have reported CK2 functions, CK2 biology is complex and an available high-quality chemical tool such as SGC-CK2-1 will be indispensable in deciphering the relationships between CK2 function and phenotypes.

Abstract: During meiosis, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material. This exchange or meiotic recombination is mediated by a proteinaceous scaffold known as the Synaptonemal complex (SC). Any defects in its formation produce failures in meiotic recombination, chromosome segregation and meiosis completion. It has been proposed that DNA repair events that will be resolved by crossover between homologous chromosomes are predetermined by the SC. Hence, structural analysis of the organization of the DNA in the SC could shed light on the process of crossover interference. In this work, we employed an ultrastructural DNA staining technique on mouse testis and followed nuclei of pachytene cells. We observed structures organized similarly to the SCs stained with conventional techniques. These structures, presumably the DNA in the SCs, are delineating the edges of both lateral elements and no staining was observed between them. DNA in the LEs resembles two parallel tracks. However, a bubble-like staining pattern in certain regions of the SC was observed. Furthermore, this staining pattern is found in SCs formed between non-homologous chromosomes, in SCs formed between sister chromatids and in SCs without lateral elements, suggesting that this particular organization of the DNA is determined by the synapsis of the chromosomes despite their lack of homology or the presence of partially formed SCs.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic activities are altered in cancer cells compared with those in normal cells, and the cancer-specific pathway becomes a potential therapeutic target. Higher cellular glucose consumption, which leads to lower glucose levels, is a hallmark of cancer cells. In an objective screening for chemicals that induce cell death under low-glucose conditions, we discovered a compound, denoted as ALESIA (Anticancer Ligand Enhancing Starvation-induced Apoptosis). By our shedding assay of transforming growth factor α in HEK293A cells, ALESIA was determined to act as a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3–G12-biased agonist that promotes nitric oxide production and oxidative stress. The oxidative stress triggered by ALESIA resulted in the exhaustion of glucose, cellular NADPH deficiency, and then cancer cell death. Intraperitoneal administration of ALESIA improved the survival of mice with peritoneally disseminated rhabdomyosarcoma, indicating its potential as a new type of anticancer drug for glucose starvation therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Most mammals express a functional GGTA1 gene encoding the N-acetyllactosaminide α-1,3-galactosyltransferase enzyme, which synthesizes Gal-α1-3Gal-β1-4GlcNAc (α-gal) and are thus tolerant to this self-expressed glycan. Old World primates including humans, however, carry loss-of-function mutations in GGTA1 and lack α-gal. Presumably, fixation of such mutations was propelled by natural selection, favoring the emergence of α-gal-specific immunity, conferring resistance to α-gal-expressing pathogens. Here, we show that loss of Ggta1 function in mice enhances resistance to bacterial sepsis, irrespectively of α-Gal-specific immunity. Rather, the absence of α-gal from IgG-associated glycans increases IgG effector function via a mechanism associated with enhanced IgG-Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) binding. The ensuing survival advantage against sepsis comes alongside a cost of accelerated reproductive senescence in Ggta1-deleted mice. Mathematical modeling of this trade-off suggests that high exposure to virulent pathogens exerts sufficient selective pressure to fix GGTA1 loss-of-function mutations, as likely occurred during the evolution of primates toward humans.

Abstract: Summary
Enterovirus uncoating receptors bind at the surface depression (“canyon”) that encircles each capsid vertex causing the release of a host-derived lipid called “pocket factor” that is buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the major viral capsid protein, VP1. Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a universal uncoating receptor of group B coxsackieviruses (CVB). Here, we present five high-resolution cryoEM structures of CVB representing different stages of virus infection. Structural comparisons show that the CAR penetrates deeper into the canyon than other uncoating receptors, leading to a cascade of events: collapse of the VP1 hydrophobic pocket, high-efficiency release of the pocket factor and viral uncoating and genome release under neutral pH, as compared with low pH. Furthermore, we identified a potent therapeutic antibody that can neutralize viral infection by interfering with virion-CAR interactions, destabilizing the capsid and inducing virion disruption. Together, these results define the structural basis of CVB cell entry and antibody neutralization.

Abstract: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a dominant autosomal genetic disorder, associated with mutations in several genes that exhibit multisystem abnormal development including cardiac defects. NS associated with the Son of Sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) gene mutation attributes to the development of cardiomyopathy and congenital heart defects. Since the treatment option for NS is very limited, an in vitro disease model with SOS1 gene mutation would be beneficial for exploring therapeutic possibilities for NS. We reprogrammed cardiac fibroblasts obtained from a NS patient and normal control skin fibroblasts (C-SF) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We identified NS-iPSCs carry a heterozygous single nucleotide variation in the SOS1 gene at the c.1654A > G. Furthermore, the control and NS-iPSCs were differentiated into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMCs), and the electron microscopic analysis showed that the sarcomeres of the NS-iCMCs were highly disorganized. FACS analysis showed that 47.5% of the NS-iCMCs co-expressed GATA4 and cardiac troponin T proteins, and the mRNA expression levels of many cardiac related genes, studied by qRT-PCR array, were significantly reduced when compared to the control C-iCMCs. We report for the first time that NS-iPSCs carry a single nucleotide variation in the SOS1 gene at the c.1654A>G were showing significantly reduced cardiac genes and proteins expression as well as structurally and functionally compromised when compared to C-iCMCs. These iPSCs and iCMCs can be used as a modeling platform to unravel the pathologic mechanisms and also the development of novel drug for the cardiomyopathy in patients with NS.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing evidence of a significant correlation between prolonged drug-target residence time and increased drug efficacy. Here, we report a structural rationale for kinetic selectivity between two closely related kinases: focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2). We found that slowly dissociating FAK inhibitors induce helical structure at the DFG motif of FAK but not PYK2. Binding kinetic data, high-resolution structures and mutagenesis data support the role of hydrophobic interactions of inhibitors with the DFG-helical region, providing a structural rationale for slow dissociation rates from FAK and kinetic selectivity over PYK2. Our experimental data correlate well with computed relative residence times from molecular simulations, supporting a feasible strategy for rationally optimizing ligand residence times. We suggest that the interplay between the protein structural mobility and ligand-induced effects is a key regulator of the kinetic selectivity of inhibitors of FAK versus PYK2.

Abstract: HSP90, one of the molecular chaperones, contributes to protein stability in most living organisms. Previously, we found cleavage of HSP90 by caspase 10 in response to treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor or proteasome inhibitor in leukemic cell lines. In this study, we investigated this phenomenon in various cell lines and found that HSP90 was cleaved by treatment with SAHA or MG132 in 6 out of 16 solid tumor cell lines. To further investigate the effects of HSP90 cleavage on cells, we introduced mutations to the potential cleavage sites of HSP90β and found that the 294th aspartic acid residue of the protein was mainly cleaved. In the K562 and Mia-PaCa-2 cell lines expressing HSP90β D294A, the cleavage of HSP90 by the treatment with SAHA or MG132 was reduced compared with the K562 and Mia-PaCa-2 cell lines expressing HSP90β WT. Accordingly, cell growth and survival were enhanced by HSP90β D294A expression. Therefore, we suggest that HSP90 cleavage widely occurs in several cell lines, and cleavage of HSP90 may have a potential for one of the mechanisms involved in the anti-tumor effects of known drugs and novel anti-tumor drug candidates.

Abstract: Having healthy adipose tissue is essential for metabolic health, as excessive adipose tissue in the body can cause its dysregulation and driving chronic metabolic diseases. Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is considered to be a key kinase in signal transduction, which regulates multiple cellular functions, but its physiological functions in adipose are still not fully understood. This study aimed at elucidating the function of adipocyte PKD1 on lipogenesis. From RNA-Sequencing data, we found that the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in white adipose tissue lacking PKD1 was significantly affected. Critical rate-limiting enzymes for de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes, such as FASN, ACCα, and SCD1, were significantly repressed after deleting PKD1 in vivo and in vitro. Further studies revealed that blockade of PKD1 significantly increased phosphorylation of SREBP1c at serine 372 site. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that PKD1 interacts with SREBP1c in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, overexpression of SREBP1c reversed the inhibition of FASN and ACCα expression caused by PKD1 silencing. Together, adipocyte PKD1 promotes de novo lipogenesis via SREBP1c-dependent manner in visceral white adipose tissue and might provide a new target for the development of anti-obesity therapies.

Abstract: The Polycomb Group Ring Finger 3 (PCGF3) protein has been reported to be significantly upregulated in pancreatic islet tumors and related to signal transduction; however, its detailed mechanisms and biological roles in other tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remain unclear. This study investigated the function of PCGF3 in NSCLC and further elucidated its mechanism of action. The immunohistochemical analysis of 86 selected lung cancer tissues revealed that PCGF3 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and p-TNM staging. Additionally, PCGF3 promoted cell proliferation in lung cancer by regulating CyclinB1, CyclinD1, and CDK4 expression, and also promoting their migration by regulating RhoA, RhoC, and CDC42. Furthermore, PCGF3 affected both the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, as verified by inhibiting this pathway using LY294002. The findings of this study suggested that PCGF3 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC and could therefore be an important biomarker for treating and preventing NSCLC.

Abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) are cell wall components of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, which cause clinical and subclinical mastitis, respectively. However, the reason of the difference in symptoms by pathogen type remains unclear. In this study, the influence of LPS and LTA on early response and milk production in lactating bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) was comparatively investigated. The results showed that LPS decreased the secretion of β-casein, lactose, and triglycerides, whereas LTA decreased the secretion of lactose and triglycerides but increased lactoferrin production without any influence on β-casein secretion. In addition, the influence of milk lipid droplet size in BMECs and gene expression related to milk fat synthesis was different between LPS and LTA. LPS increased the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-8 through the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways, whereas LTA increased IL-1β and CC chemokine ligand 5 expression through the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, these cytokines and chemokines differently affected the milk production ability of BMECs. These results suggested that the pathogen-specific symptoms may be related to the differences in the early response of BMECs to bacterial toxins.

Abstract: Summary
Floating spheroidal aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells can develop into polarized/elongated organoids, namely gastruloids. We set up a high-performing assay to measure gastruloid formation efficiency (GFE), and found that GFE decreases as pluripotency progresses from naive (GFE ≥ 95%) to primed (GFE = 0) state. Specifically, we show that primed EpiSCs fail to generate proper cell aggregates, while early-primed EpiLCs aggregate but eventually fail to develop into elongated gastruloids. Moreover, we characterized proline-induced cells (PiCs), a LIF-dependent reversible early-primed state of pluripotency, and show that PiCs are able to generate gastruloids (GFE ∼ 50%) and are also competent to differentiate into primordial germ cell-like cells. Thus, we propose the GFE assay as a valuable functional tool to discriminate different states of the pluripotency continuum.

Abstract: Summary
We aimed to establish an in vitro differentiation procedure to generate matured small intestinal cells mimicking human small intestine from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We previously reported the efficient generation of CDX2-expressing intestinal progenitor cells from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO) and (3,5-difluorophenylacetyl)-L-alanyl-L-2-phenylglycine tert-butyl ester (DAPT) to treat definitive endodermal cells. Here, we demonstrate the generation of enterocyte-like cells by culturing human iPSC-derived intestinal progenitor cells on a collagen vitrigel membrane (CVM) and treating cells with a simple maturation medium containing BIO, DMSO, dexamethasone, and activated vitamin D3. Functional tests further confirmed that these iPSC-derived enterocyte-like cells exhibit P-gp- and BCRP-mediated efflux and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)-mediated metabolism. We concluded that hiPS cell-derived enterocyte-like cells can be used as a model for the evaluation of drug transport and metabolism studies in the human small intestine.

Abstract: Summary
Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) counteract ubiquitylation to control stability or activity of substrates. Identification of DUB substrates is challenging because multiple DUBs can act on the same substrate, thwarting genetic approaches. Here, we circumvent redundancy by chemically inhibiting multiple DUBs simultaneously in Xenopus egg extract. We used quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins whose ubiquitylation or stability is altered by broad DUB inhibition, and confirmed their DUB-dependent regulation with human orthologs, demonstrating evolutionary conservation. We next extended this method to profile DUB specificity. By adding recombinant DUBs to extract where DUB activity was broadly inhibited, but ubiquitylation and degradation were active at physiological rates, we profiled the ability of DUBs to rescue degradation of these substrates. We found that USP7 has a unique ability to broadly antagonize degradation. Together, we present an approach to identify DUB substrates and characterize DUB specificity that overcomes challenges posed by DUB redundancy.

Abstract: Liver damage is the most severe complication of heat stress (HS). Hydrolyzed camel whey protein (CWP) possesses bioactive peptides with obviously antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The current study aims to investigate whether CWP that is hydrolyzed by a simulated gastrointestinal digestion process, named S-CWP, protects BRL-3A hepatocytes from HS-induced damage via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. BRL-3A cells were pretreated with S-CWP before being treated at 43°C for 1 h, and the levels of the cellular oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, biomarkers for liver function, the activities of several antioxidant enzymes, and the cell viability were analyzed. The expression level of pivotal proteins in correlative signaling pathways was evaluated by western blotting. We confirmed that S-CWP alleviated HS-induced hepatocytes oxidative stress by decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), 8-Hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonylation (PCO), and the activities of NADPH oxidase while enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activities, and GSH content. S-CWP suppressed HS-induced inflammatory response by reducing the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, the expression of NLRP3, and caspase-1 and finally alleviated caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. S-CWP also alleviated HS-induced hepatocyte injury by reducing alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and restoring Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) expression. Furthermore, S-CWP treatment significantly enhanced the expression of NF-E2-related nuclear factor erythroid-2 (Nrf2) and HO-1. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of S-CWP were weakened by ML385, a specific Nrf2 inhibitor. Additionally, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, significantly reversed S-CWP-induced reduction in the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Thus, our results revealed that S-CWP protected against HS-induced hepatocytes damage via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and inhibiting NF-κB/NLRP3 axis.

Abstract: Summary
Despite almost 40 years having passed from the initial discovery of ubiquitin (Ub), fundamental questions related to its intracellular metabolism are still enigmatic. Here we utilized fluorescent tracking for monitoring ubiquitin turnover in mammalian cells, resulting in obtaining qualitatively new data. In the present study we report (1) short Ub half-life estimated as 4 h; (2) for a median of six Ub molecules per substrate as a dynamic equilibrium between Ub ligases and deubiquitinated enzymes (DUBs); (3) loss on average of one Ub molecule per four acts of engagement of polyubiquitinated substrate by the proteasome; (4) direct correlation between incorporation of Ub into the distinct type of chains and Ub half-life; and (5) critical influence of the single lysine residue K27 on the stability of the whole Ub molecule. Concluding, our data provide a comprehensive understanding of ubiquitin-proteasome system dynamics on the previously unreachable state of the art.

Abstract: Macrophage mediated inflammation and foam cell formation play crucial roles in the development of atherosclerosis. MiR-375 is a small noncoding RNA that significantly implicated in multiple tumor regulation and has been emerged as a novel biomarker for type 2 diabetes. However, the exact role of miR-375 on macrophage activation remains unknown. In the present study, we observed that miR-375 expression showed an up-regulated expression in atherosclerotic aortas, as well as in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) isolated from ApoE deficiency mice and was gradually increased followed the Ox-LDL treated time. Functionally, miR-375 inhibition significantly decreased foam cell formation accompanied by up-regulated genes expression involved in cholesterol efflux but reduced genes expression implicated in cholesterol influx. Moreover, miR-375 silencing increased resolving M2 macrophage but reduced pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage markers expression. Such above effects can be reversed by miR-375 overexpression. Mechanistically, we noticed that miR-375 knockdown promoted KLF4 expression which was required for the ameliorated effect of miR-375 silencing on macrophage activation. Importantly, the consistent results in mRNA expression of M1 and M2 markers were observed in vivo, and miR-375−/−ApoE−/− mice significant decreased atherosclerotic lesions in the whole aorta and aortic sinus. Taken together, these evidences suggested that miR-375 knockdown attenuated macrophage activation partially through activation of KLF4-dependent mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants often develop an altered gut microbiota composition, which is related to clinical complications, such as necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis. Probiotic supplementation may reduce these complications, and modulation of the gut microbiome is a potential mechanism underlying the probiotic effectiveness. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the effect of Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation, from birth to post-menstrual week (PMW)36, on infant gut microbiota. We performed 16S amplicon sequencing in 558 stool samples from 132 ELBW preterm infants at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, PMW36, and 2 years. Probiotic supplementation results in increased bacterial diversity and increased L. reuteri abundance during the 1st month. At 1 week, probiotic supplementation also results in a lower abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae. No effects were found at 2 years. In conclusion, probiotics may exert benefits by modulating the gut microbiota composition during the 1st month in ELBW infants.

Abstract: COVID-19 has spread to all countries around the world after it was first discovered in Wuhan of China at the end of 2019. It is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with much semblance to SARS-CoV including the sequence homology and disease symptoms. It is reported to be more infectious than SARS-CoV due to higher binding affinities between its spike protein and the ACE2 receptor on cell surface. Despite this, its case fatality rate is much lower compared with that of SARS-CoV although it varies in different countries. However, the case fatality rate increases steadily with age and it is reported to be the highest in aged COVID-19 male patients in almost all countries. Consistent with these, females have higher antiviral immune responses. Males and females are different in inflammatory response and aberrantly hyperactive cytokines are the main lethal causes of COVID-19. Interestingly, the gene encoding the ACE2 receptor protein and some genes encoding the immune regulatory proteins such as TLR7 are located on X chromosome which is subject to X chromosome inactivation and sex hormone regulation. These may account for some sex-dependent immune responses and lethality observed in COVID-19 patients. In general, children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and only less than 1% of pediatric COVID-19 patients may die of COVID-19. However, the most severe pediatric cases become multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is similar to Kawasiki disease with features of viral infection. Since most infected kids were boys in China, there may be sex-dependent immune response in pediatric COVID-19 cases as well.

Abstract: CCHCR1 (Coiled-Coil alpha-Helical Rod 1), maps to chromosomal region 6p21.3, within the major psoriasis susceptibility locus PSORS1. CCHCR1 itself is a plausible psoriasis candidate gene, however its role in psoriasis pathogenesis remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that CCHCR1 protein acts as a cytoplasmic docking site for RNA polymerase II core subunit 3 (RPB3) in cycling cells, suggesting a role for CCHCR1 in vesicular trafficking between cellular compartments. Here, we report a novel interaction between CCHCR1 and the RNA binding protein HAX1. HAX1 maps to chromosomal region 1q21.3 within the PSORS4 locus and is over-expressed in psoriasis. Both CCHCR1 and HAX1 share subcellular co-localization with mitochondria, nuclei and cytoplasmic vesicles as P-bodies. By a series of ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, we isolated a pool of mRNAs complexed with HAX1 and/or CCHCR1 proteins. Among the mRNAs complexed with both CCHCR1 and HAX1 proteins, there are Vimentin mRNA, previously described to be bound by HAX1, and CAMP/LL37 mRNA, whose gene product is over-expressed in psoriasis.

Abstract: Summary
Necroptosis is a form of cell death characterized by receptor-interacting protein kinase activity and plasma membrane permeabilization via mixed-lineage kinase-like protein (MLKL). This permeabilization is responsible for the inflammatory properties of necroptosis. We previously showed that very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are functionally involved in necroptosis, potentially through protein fatty acylation. Here, we define the scope of protein acylation by saturated VLCFAs during necroptosis. We show that MLKL and phosphoMLKL, key for membrane permeabilization, are exclusively acylated during necroptosis. Reducing the levels of VLCFAs decreases their membrane recruitment, suggesting that acylation by VLCFAs contributes to their membrane localization. Acylation of phosphoMLKL occurs downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appears to be, in part, mediated by ZDHHC5 (a palmitoyl transferase). We also show that disruption of endosomal trafficking increases cell viability during necroptosis, possibly by preventing recruitment, or removal, of phosphoMLKL from the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Summary
The photo-regulation of transgene expression is one effective approach in mammalian synthetic biology due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. While DNAs are mainly used as vectors, modified RNAs (modRNAs) are also useful for medical applications of synthetic biology, because they can avoid insertional mutagenesis and immunogenicity. However, the optogenetic control of modRNA-delivered transgenes is much more difficult than that of DNA-delivered transgenes. Here, we develop two types of photo-controllable translational activation systems that are compatible with modRNAs. One is composed of a heterodimerization domain-fused split translational activator protein and a photocaged heterodimerizer. The other is composed of a destabilizing domain-fused translational activator protein and a photocaged stabilizer. The destabilized type can be used for not only translational activation but also translational repression of the modRNAs. These photo-controllable translation systems will expand the application of mammalian synthetic biology research.

Abstract: Pulpitis refers to inflammation of the inner pulp by invading microbes, and tissue repair occurs due to odontogenic differentiation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) with multidifferentiation potential. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can modulate numerous pathological and biological processes; however, the role of lncRNAs in the inflammation and regeneration of the dentin-pulp complex in pulpitis is unclear. Here, we performed high-throughput sequencing to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs between human normal and inflamed pulp and concluded that lncMEG3 (lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3, MEG3) was signiﬁcantly upregulated in both inflamed pulp and LPS-treated hDPCs. MEG3 expression in the pulp tissue was detected using the RNAscope® technique. RNA pulldown assays identified the MEG3-interacting proteins and the potential mechanisms. With MEG3 knockdown, we investigated the role of MEG3 in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-treated hDPCs and odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs. MEG3 downregulation inhibited the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in LPS-treated hDPCs, and the p38/MAPK signaling pathway may be related to this effect. MEG3 knockdown promoted odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our study suggested that MEG3 has a negative effect on inflammation and regeneration of the dentin-pulp complex in pulpitis.

Abstract: Heatstroke (HS) is an acute clinical disease characterized by abnormal hyperthermia and multi-organ dysfunction. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1, also called heat shock protein (HSP)32, is induced by hyperthermia and also plays protective roles in many lung disease models. Based on this phenomenon, we investigated the protective role of endogenous HO-1 in heat-induced lung damage in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were separated into three groups: (a) normothermic sham, (b) HS, and (c) SnPP (inhibitor of HO-1) pretreatment rats. In the HS group, rats were killed at various time points (1, 3, 6, and 12 h after heat exposure) in order to analyze messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels. Lung sections were examined for tissue damage and localization of HO-1 using immunofluorescence double labeling. We found that HS induced lung pathology (congested and thickened lung septa). The level of HO-1 mRNA was increased at 1 h, and the protein level peaked at 6 h after heat exposure. Pretreatment with SnPP (tin-protoporphyrin IX, 30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection for 1 h before heat exposure) aggravated the lung damage. Furthermore, we demonstrated HO-1 expression in lung type II pneumocytes. Our results suggest that endogenous HO-1 is protective against HS-induced lung damage. Induction of HO-1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating heat-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput physiological assays lose single-cell resolution, precluding subtype-specific analyses of activation mechanism and drug effects. We demonstrate APPOINT (automated physiological phenotyping of individual neuronal types), a physiological assay platform combining calcium imaging, robotic liquid handling, and automated analysis to generate physiological activation profiles of single neurons at large scale. Using unbiased techniques, we quantify responses to sequential stimuli, enabling subgroup identification by physiology and probing of distinct mechanisms of neuronal activation within subgroups. Using APPOINT, we quantify primary sensory neuron activation by metabotropic receptor agonists and identify potential contributors to pain signaling. We expand the role of neuroimmune interactions by showing that human serum directly activates sensory neurons, elucidating a new potential pain mechanism. Finally, we apply APPOINT to develop a high-throughput, all-optical approach for quantification of activation threshold and pharmacologically validate contributions of ion channel families to optical activation.

Abstract: Summary
T cell development is restricted to the thymus and is dependent on high levels of Notch signaling induced within the thymic microenvironment. To understand Notch function in thymic restriction, we investigated the basis for target gene selectivity in response to quantitative differences in Notch signal strength, focusing on the chromatin architecture of genes essential for T cell differentiation. We find that high Notch signal strength is required to activate promoters of known targets essential for T cell commitment, including Il2ra, Cd3ε, and Rag1, which feature low CpG content (LCG) and DNA inaccessibility in hematopoietic stem progenitor cells. Our findings suggest that promoter DNA inaccessibility at LCG T lineage genes provides robust protection against stochastic activation in inappropriate Notch signaling contexts, limiting T cell development to the thymus.

Abstract: Summary
The bile salt export pump (BSEP) is responsible for the export of bile acid from hepatocytes. Impaired transcellular transport of bile acids in hepatocytes with mutations in BSEP causes cholestasis. Compensatory mechanisms to regulate the intracellular bile acid concentration in human hepatocytes with BSEP deficiency remain unclear. To define pathways that prevent cytotoxic accumulation of bile acid in hepatocytes, we developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell-based model of isogenic BSEP-deficient hepatocytes in a Transwell culture system. Induced hepatocytes (i-Heps) exhibited defects in the apical export of bile acids but maintained a low intracellular bile acid concentration by inducing basolateral export. Modeling the autoregulation of bile acids on hepatocytes, we found that BSEP-deficient i-Heps suppressed de novo bile acid synthesis using the FXR pathway via basolateral uptake and export without apical export. These observations inform the development of therapeutic targets to reduce the overall bile acid pool in patients with BSEP deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
CD8+ T cell recognition of peptide epitopes plays a central role in immune responses against pathogens and tumors. However, the rules that govern which peptides are truly recognized by existing T cell receptors (TCRs) remain poorly understood, precluding accurate predictions of neo-epitopes for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we capitalize on recent (neo-)epitope data to train a predictor of immunogenic epitopes (PRIME), which captures molecular properties of both antigen presentation and TCR recognition. PRIME not only improves prioritization of neo-epitopes but also correlates with T cell potency and unravels biophysical determinants of TCR recognition that we experimentally validate. Analysis of cancer genomics data reveals that recurrent mutations tend to be less frequent in patients where they are predicted to be immunogenic, providing further evidence for immunoediting in human cancer. PRIME will facilitate identification of pathogen epitopes in infectious diseases and neo-epitopes in cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) are neocortical neuronal precursors. Although IPCs play crucial roles in corticogenesis, their molecular features remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to characterize the molecular profile of IPCs. We isolated TBR2-positive (+) IPCs and TBR2-negative (−) cell populations in the developing mouse cortex. Comparative genome-wide gene expression analysis of TBR2+ IPCs versus TBR2− cells revealed differences in key factors involved in chromatid segregation, cell-cycle regulation, transcriptional regulation, and cell signaling. Notably, mutation of many IPC genes in human has led to intellectual disability and caused a wide range of cortical malformations, including microcephaly and agenesis of corpus callosum. Loss-of-function experiments in cortex-specific mutants of Esco2, one of the novel IPC genes, demonstrate its critical role in IPC maintenance, and substantiate the identification of a central genetic determinant of IPC biogenesis. Our data provide novel molecular characteristics of IPCs in the developing mouse cortex.

Abstract: Summary
The immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been attributed to a combination of host genetics and intestinal dysbiosis. Previous work in a small cohort of IBD patients suggested that pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa are highly coated with secretory immunoglobulin IgA. Using bacterial fluorescence-activated cell sorting coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing (IgA-SEQ), we profiled IgA coating of intestinal microbiota in a large cohort of IBD patients and identified bacteria associated with disease and treatment. Forty-three bacterial taxa displayed significantly higher IgA coating in IBD compared with controls, including 8 taxa exhibiting differential IgA coating but similar relative abundance. Patients treated with anti-TNF-α therapies exhibited dramatically altered microbiota-specific IgA responses compared with controls. Furthermore, increased IgA coating of Oscillospira was associated with a delay in time to surgery. These results demonstrate that investigating IgA responses to microbiota can uncover potential disease-modifying taxa and reveal improved biomarkers of clinical course in IBD.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence revealed the abnormal expression of KLF5 in human cancers while its role in melanoma remains uncharacterized. This study aimed to explore the role of KLF5 in the proliferation and metastasis of melanoma. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to detect WWP1, BAP1 and KLF5 expression in melanoma, followed by expression determination on clinical tissues from melanoma patients and cancer cells. The cancer cells were infected with lentivirus expressing KLF5 or BAP1 while PI3K, AKT and mTOR expression was detected and autophagy was observed. Treated cells were injected to mice when tumor growth was measured and autophagy-related protein was detected. Plasmids expressing WWP1 and Ub-K48 were co-transfected into treated melanoma cells while immunoprecipitation assay was performed to determine the interaction among KLF5, WWP1, and BAP1. WWP1 was poorly expressed in melanoma cells and tissues whereas KLF5 was highly expressed and was positively correlated to poor prognosis. KLF5 promoted melanoma cell malignant phenotypes as well as inhibited autophagy. Interestingly, KLF5 contributed to activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting autophagy in melanoma cells. WWP1 mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of KLF5 to promote its degradation, and BAP1 antagonized this modification and stabilized KLF5 protein expression. Besides, BAP1 promoted KLF5-mediated growth of melanoma in vivo. Taken altogether, BAP1 antagonized WWP1-mediated ubiquitination of KLF5 to inhibit autophagy and promote melanoma development.

Abstract: Summary
Phenotypic screening for bioactive small molecules is typically combined with affinity-based chemical proteomics to uncover the respective molecular targets. However, such assays and the explored bioactivity are biased toward the monitored phenotype, and target identification often requires chemical derivatization of the hit compound. In contrast, unbiased cellular profiling approaches record hundreds of parameters upon compound perturbation to map bioactivity in a broader biological context and may link a profile to the molecular target or mode of action. Herein we report the discovery of the diaminopyrimidine DP68 as a Sigma 1 (σ1) receptor antagonist by combining morphological profiling using the Cell Painting assay and thermal proteome profiling. Our results highlight that integration of complementary profiling approaches may enable both detection of bioactivity and target identification for small molecules.

Abstract: Summary
Persons with HIV are at increased risk for diabetes mellitus compared with individuals without HIV. Adipose tissue is an important regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue T cells modulate local inflammatory responses and, by extension, adipocyte function. Persons with HIV and diabetes have a high proportion of CX3CR1+ GPR56+ CD57+ (C-G-C+) CD4+ T cells in adipose tissue, a subset of which are cytomegalovirus specific, whereas individuals with diabetes but without HIV have predominantly CD69+ CD4+ T cells. Adipose tissue CD69+ and C-G-C+ CD4+ T cell subsets demonstrate higher receptor clonality compared with the same cells in blood, potentially reflecting antigen-driven expansion, but C-G-C+ CD4+ T cells have a more inflammatory and cytotoxic RNA transcriptome. Future studies will explore whether viral antigens have a role in recruitment and proliferation of pro-inflammatory C-G-C+ CD4+ T cells in adipose tissue of persons with HIV.

Abstract: Summary
The role of two-pore channel 2 (TPC2), one of the few cation channels localized on endolysosomal membranes, in cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we report that TPC2 knockout reduces proliferation of cancer cells in vitro, affects their energy metabolism, and successfully abrogates tumor growth in vivo. Concurrently, we have developed simplified analogs of the alkaloid tetrandrine as potent TPC2 inhibitors by screening a library of synthesized benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives. Removal of dispensable substructures of the lead molecule tetrandrine increases antiproliferative properties against cancer cells and impairs proangiogenic signaling of endothelial cells to a greater extent than tetrandrine. Simultaneously, toxic effects on non-cancerous cells are reduced, allowing in vivo administration and revealing a TPC2 inhibitor with antitumor efficacy in mice. Hence, our study unveils TPC2 as valid target for cancer therapy and provides easily accessible tetrandrine analogs as a promising option for effective pharmacological interference.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils in the brain is linked to Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. The intermediate species in the early aggregation phase of α-synuclein are involved in the emergence of amyloid toxicity and considered to be the most neurotoxic. The N-terminal region flanking the non-amyloid-β component domain of α-synuclein has been implicated in modulating its aggregation. Herein, we report the development of a SUMO1-derived peptide inhibitor (SUMO1(15–55)), which targets two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) within this aggregation-regulating region and suppresses α-synuclein aggregation. Molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and binding studies are used to elucidate the mode of interaction, namely, via the binding of either of the two SIM sequences on α-synuclein to a putative hydrophobic binding groove on SUMO1(15–55). Subsequent studies show that SUMO1(15–55) also reduces α-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity in cell-based and Drosophila disease models.

Abstract: Summary
CpG islands often exhibit low DNA methylation, high histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, low nucleosome density, and high DNase I hypersensitivity, yet the rules by which CpG islands are sensed remain poorly understood. In this study, we first evaluated the relationships between the DNA and the chromatin properties of CpG islands in embryonic stem cells using modified bacterial artificial chromosomes. Then, using a bioinformatic approach, we identified strict CpG-island density and length thresholds in mouse embryonic stem and differentiated cells that consistently specify low DNA methylation levels. Surprisingly, the human genome exhibited a dramatically different relationship between DNA properties and DNA methylation levels of CpG islands. Further analysis allowed speculation that this difference is accommodated in part by evolutionary changes in the nucleotide composition of orthologous promoters. Thus, a change in the rules by which CpG-island properties are sensed may have co-evolved with compensatory genome adaptation events during mammalian evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Recent trials of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transplantation for the treatment of disorders such as age-related macular degeneration have been promising. However, limitations of existing strategies include the uncertain survival of RPE cells delivered by cell suspension and the inherent risk of uncontrolled cell proliferation in the vitreous cavity. Human RPE stem cell-derived RPE (hRPESC-RPE) transplantation can rescue vision in a rat model of retinal dystrophy and survive in the rabbit retina for at least 1 month. The present study placed hRPESC-RPE monolayers under the macula of a non-human primate model for 3 months. The transplant was able to recover in vivo and maintained healthy photoreceptors. Importantly, there was no evidence that subretinally transplanted monolayers underwent an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Neither gliosis in adjacent retina nor epiretinal membranes were observed. These findings suggest that hRPESC-RPE monolayers are safe and may be a useful source for RPE cell replacement therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic vaccination regimens inducing clinically effective tumor-specific CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are an unmet medical need. We engineer two distantly related arenaviruses, Pichinde virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, for therapeutic cancer vaccination. In mice, life-replicating vector formats of these two viruses delivering a self-antigen in a heterologous prime-boost regimen induce tumor-specific CTL responses up to 50% of the circulating CD8 T cell pool. This CTL attack eliminates established solid tumors in a significant proportion of animals, accompanied by protection against tumor rechallenge. The magnitude of CTL responses is alarmin driven and requires combining two genealogically distantly related arenaviruses. Vector-neutralizing antibodies do not inhibit booster immunizations by the same vector or by closely related vectors. Rather, CTL immunodominance hierarchies favor vector backbone-targeted responses at the expense of self-reactive CTLs. These findings establish an arenavirus-based immunotherapy regimen that allows reshuffling of immunodominance hierarchies and breaking self-directed tolerance for efficient tumor control.

Abstract: Inflammation and alveolar bone destruction constitute the main pathological process of periodontitis. However, the molecular mechanisms of bone destruction under the inflammation environment remain unclear. This study aims to explore the role of Ephrin-B2/EphB4 signaling in osteogenic differentiation under the inflammation environment. Mouse pre-osteoblasts MC3T3-E1 were pretreated with lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg-LPS). The Ephrin-B2/EphB4 signaling was activated, and the osteogenic differentiation of cells was examined. The results showed that activation of Ephrin-B2/EphB4 signaling promoted the expression levels of osteogenic differentiation-related genes, and also relieved the inhibitory effect of Pg-LPS on osteogenesis. Noticeably, the effect of Ephrin-B2/EphB4 signaling might be related to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. While applying Ephrin-B2-Fc and EphB4-Fc to periodontitis mice, we observed the reduction of alveolar crest destruction. The current study revealed the possible role of Ephrin-B2/EphB4 signaling in reducing bone destruction in periodontitis and suggested its potential values for further research.

Abstract: Summary
Peroxynitrite is a reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that plays critical roles in signal transduction, stress response, and numerous human diseases. Advanced molecular tools that permit the selective, sensitive, and noninvasive detection of peroxynitrite are essential for understanding its pathophysiological functions. Here, we present pnGFP-Ultra, a high-performance, reaction-based, genetically encodable biosensor for imaging peroxynitrite in live cells. pnGFP-Ultra features a p-boronophenylalanine-modified chromophore as the sensing moiety and exhibits a remarkable ~110-fold fluorescence turn-on response toward peroxynitrite while displaying virtually no cross-reaction with other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. To facilitate the expression of pnGFP-Ultra in mammalian cells, we engineered an efficient noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) expression system that is broadly applicable to the mammalian expression of ncAA-containing proteins. pnGFP-Ultra robustly detected peroxynitrite production in activated macrophages and primary glial cells. pnGFP-Ultra fills an important technical gap and represents a valuable addition to the molecular toolbox for probing RNS biology.

Abstract: Summary
Early detection of infection is crucial to limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here we develop a flow cytometry-based assay to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein antibodies in individuals with COVID-19. The assay detects specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG in individuals with COVID-19 and also acquisition of all IgG subclasses, with IgG1 being the most dominant. The antibody response is significantly higher at a later stage of infection. Furthermore, asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 also develop specific IgM, IgA, and IgG, with IgG1 being the most dominant subclass. Although the antibody levels are lower in asymptomatic infection, the assay is highly sensitive and detects 97% of asymptomatic infections. These findings demonstrate that the assay can be used for serological analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, which may otherwise remain undetected.

Abstract: The laryngotracheal cartilage is a cardinal framework for the maintenance of the airway for breathing, which occasionally requires reconstruction. Because hyaline cartilage has a poor intrinsic regenerative ability, various regenerative approaches have been attempted to regenerate laryngotracheal cartilage. The use of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cartilage regeneration has been widely investigated. However, long-term culture may limit proliferative capacity. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs (iMSCs) can circumvent this problem due to their unlimited proliferative capacity. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of iMSCs in the regeneration of thyroid cartilage in immunodeficient rats. Herein, we induced iMSCs through neural crest cell intermediates. For the relevance to prospective future clinical application, induction was conducted under xeno-free/serum-free conditions. Then, clumps fabricated from an iMSC/extracellular matrix complex (C-iMSC) were transplanted into thyroid cartilage defects in immunodeficient rats. Histological examinations revealed cartilage-like regenerated tissue and human nuclear antigen (HNA)-positive surviving transplanted cells in the regenerated lesion. HNA-positive cells co-expressed SOX9, and type II collagen was identified around HNA-positive cells. These results indicated that the transplanted C-iMSCs promoted thyroid cartilage regeneration and some of the iMSCs differentiated into chondrogenic lineage cells. Induced MSCs may be a promising candidate cell therapy for human laryngotracheal reconstruction.

Abstract: The human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) (hiPSC-CMs) retain the same genetic information as the donor, and they have been shown to faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotypes of various genetic cardiac diseases. The hiPSC-CMs can be utilized in multiple types of studies and in most cases, the functionality of hiPSC-CMs is of interest. For the functional analyses, the hiPSC-CMs need to be manipulated after differentiation, e.g. enriched or dissociated into single-cell stage. For the functional assessments to be reliable and reproducible, the cell culture environment should support the cells in an optimal manner. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of various differentiation methods, as well as coating materials used for the dissociated cells on the functionality of the differentiated hiPSC-CMs. The different protocols not only had different differentiation efficiencies, but they also yielded functionally different hiPSC-CMs. Additionally, the coating material had a major effect on the functionality of the hiPSC-CMs. The results of the present study emphasize that the cardiac differentiation method and the coating material have a major effect on hiPS-CMs’ characteristics. Thus, when different hiPSC lines and results obtained in different labs are compared, extra care should be taken to check the conditions when results are compared.

Abstract: Summary
Adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) are enriched in the intestinal microbiota of patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) and promote intestinal inflammation. Yet, how AIEC metabolism of nutrients impacts intestinal homeostasis is poorly defined. Here, we show that AIEC encoding the large subunit of propanediol dehydratase (PduC), which facilitates the utilization of fucose fermentation product 1,2-propanediol, are increased in the microbiome of CD patients and drive AIEC-induced intestinal T cell inflammation. In murine models, CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) are required for PduC-dependent induction of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production that leads to AIEC-induced inflammatory colitis. Activation of this inflammatory cascade requires the catalytic activity of PduC to generate propionate, which synergizes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce IL-1β by MNPs. Disrupting fucose availability limits AIEC-induced propionate production and intestinal inflammation. These findings identify MNPs as metabolic sensors linking AIEC metabolism with intestinal inflammation and identify microbial metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in Crohn’s disease treatment.

Abstract: To investigate mechanisms that TMEM2 activation inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cells, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and mass spectrometry were used in screening interacting proteins for TMEM2. Levels of casein kinase 2 subunit α3 (CSNK2A3) in HCC cells were found to be inhibited or overexpressed using siRNAs and pcDNA3.1-CSNK2A3, respectively. Effect of CSNK2A3 expression on cell proliferation was analyzed using MTS, while its effect on HBV infection was measured using ddPCR and IHC. Western blotting and JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib were also used to determine whether TMEM2-regulated CSNK2A3 expression and HBV infection were affected by JAK-STAT signaling. Co-IP and mass spectrometry results showed that CSNK2A3 interacts with TMEM2. Moreover, overexpression of CSNK2A3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, while inhibition of CSNK2A3 promoted proliferation of HCC cells. In addition, overexpression of CSNK2A3 was observed to significantly enhance HBV infection, while siRNA knockdown of CSNK2A3 inhibited HBV infection. Notably, effect of CSNK2A3 overexpression on HBV infection was suppressed by TMEM2 overexpression. Further mechanistic analyses have revealed that TMEM2 could antagonize the effects of CSNK2A3 on cell proliferation and HBV infection via JAK-STAT pathway activation. In conclusion, TMEM2 has been determined to bind to CSNK2A3 to inhibit HBV infection via activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Positive-strand RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), flaviviruses, and coronaviruses are medically important. Assembly of replicase on host membranes is a conserved replication strategy and an attractive antiviral target. The mechanisms of replicase assembly are largely unknown, due to the technical difficulties in purifying the replicase and carrying out structural studies. Here, with an HCV replicase assembly surrogate system, we employed a bioorthogonal system to introduce the photolabile unnatural amino into each residue in the cytosolic regions of NS4B and the amphipathic helix (AH) of NS5A. Photocrosslinking enabled visualization of NS4B oligomerization and NS5A dimerization at pinpointed interacting residues and identifying contacting sites among the replicase components. Characterization of the interacting sites revealed hub elements in replicase assembly by docking replicase components to prompt protein-protein interactions. The results provide information about the molecular architecture of the replicase, advancing understanding of the mechanism of replicase assembly.

RACGAP1 modulates ECT2-Dependent mitochondrial quality control to drive breast cancer metastasis,

Abstract: Most cancer deaths are due to the colonization of tumor cells in distant organs. More evidence indicates that overexpression of RACGAP1 plays a critical role in cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism still remains poorly understood. Here we found that RACGAP1 promoted breast cancer metastasis through regulating mitochondrial quality control. Overexpression of RACGAP1 in breast cancer cells led to the fragmentation of mitochondria, increased mitophagy intensity, mitochondrial turnover, and aerobic glycolysis ATP production. We showed that RACGAP1 promoted mitochondrial fission through recruiting ECT2 during anaphase and subsequently had activated ERK-DRP1 pathway. We further demonstrated the phosphorylation of RACGAP1 is essential for its ability of binding with ECT2 and its downstream effects. RACGAP1 overexpression also increased the expression of PGC-1a, a key mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, presumably by the increased mitophagy intensity induced by RACGAP1. PGC-1a increased the enrichment of DNMT1 in mitochondria, mitochondrial DNMT1 augmented mitochondrial DNA methylation and upregulated mitochondrial genome transcription. Our data indicated that RACGAP1 simultaneously facilitated mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis through regulating DRP1 phosphorylation and PGC-1a expression, eventually improved mitochondrial quality control in breast cancer cells. Our study provided a new angle in understanding the RACGAP1-overexpression related malignancy in breast cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
Neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein are a goal of COVID-19 vaccines and have received emergency use authorization as therapeutics. However, viral escape mutants could compromise efficacy. To define immune-selected mutations in the S protein, we exposed a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus, in which the VSV glycoprotein is replaced with the S protein, to 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and generated 50 different escape mutants. Each mAb had a unique resistance profile, although many shared residues within an epitope of the RBD. Some variants (e.g., S477N) were resistant to neutralization by multiple mAbs, whereas others (e.g., E484K) escaped neutralization by convalescent sera. Additionally, sequential selection identified mutants that escape neutralization by antibody cocktails. Comparing these antibody-mediated mutations with sequence variation in circulating SARS-CoV-2 revealed substitutions that may attenuate neutralizing immune responses in some humans and thus warrant further investigation.

Abstract: Summary
Adult neural stem cell (NSC) generation in vertebrate brains requires thyroid hormones (THs). How THs enter the NSC population is unknown, although TH availability determines proliferation and neuronal versus glial progenitor determination in murine subventricular zone (SVZ) NSCs. Mice display neurological signs of the severely disabling human disease, Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, if they lack both MCT8 and OATP1C1 transporters, or MCT8 and deiodinase type 2. We analyzed the distribution of MCT8 and OATP1C1 in adult mouse SVZ. Both are strongly expressed in NSCs and at a lower level in neuronal cell precursors but not in oligodendrocyte progenitors. Next, we analyzed Mct8/Oatp1c1 double-knockout mice, where brain uptake of THs is strongly reduced. NSC proliferation and determination to neuronal fates were severely affected, but not SVZ-oligodendroglial progenitor generation. This work highlights how tight control of TH availability determines NSC function and glial-neuron cell-fate choice in adult brains.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass and activation is a therapeutic strategy to treat obesity and complications. Obese and diabetic patients possess low amounts of BAT, so an efficient way to expand their mass is necessary. There is limited knowledge about how human BAT develops, differentiates, and is optimally activated. Accessing human BAT is challenging, given its low volume and anatomical dispersion. These constraints make detailed BAT-related developmental and functional mechanistic studies in humans virtually impossible. We have developed and characterized functionally and molecularly a new chemically defined protocol for the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into brown adipocytes (BAs) that overcomes current limitations. This protocol recapitulates step by step the physiological developmental path of human BAT. The BAs obtained express BA and thermogenic markers, are insulin sensitive, and responsive to β-adrenergic stimuli. This new protocol is scalable, enabling the study of human BAs at early stages of development.

Abstract: Summary
The pleiotropic functions of macrophages in immune defense, tissue repair, and maintenance of tissue homeostasis are supported by the heterogeneity in macrophage sub-populations that differ both in ontogeny and polarization. Although glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) are integral to macrophage function and may contribute to macrophage diversity, little is known about the factors governing their expression. Here, we provide a resource for characterizing the N-/O-glycomes of various murine peritoneal macrophage sub-populations, demonstrating that glycosylation primarily reflects developmental origin and, to a lesser degree, cellular polarization. Furthermore, comparative analysis of GBP-coding genes in resident and elicited macrophages indicated that GBP expression is consistent with specialized macrophage functions and correlates with specific types of displayed glycans. An integrated, semi-quantitative approach was used to confirm distinct expression patterns of glycans and their binding proteins across different macrophages. The data suggest that regulation of glycan-protein complexes may be central to macrophage residence and recruitment.

Abstract: Canine glioma is a common brain tumor with poor prognosis despite surgery and/or radiation therapy. Therefore, newer and more effective treatment modalities are needed. Neuregulin 3 (NRG3) has known to be a ligand of ERBB4. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of the NRG3/ERBB4 signaling cascade as a novel therapeutic target in canine glioma. We found out that microRNA (miR)-190a was downregulated in canine brain tumor tissues, including glioma and meningioma. miR-190a directly targeted NRG3 and inhibited the growth of canine glioma cells. The level of p-Akt, which is a downstream target of ERBB4 signaling, was decreased by transfection with miR-190a. NRG3 silencing also suppressed cell growth and decreased the levels of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2, and NRG3 overexpression exhibited opposed effects in canine glioma J3T-1 cells. The mRNA level of erbb4 was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared with that in normal brain tissues and meningioma tissues. Furthermore, compared with gefitinib and lapatinib, afatinib exerted a greater inhibitory effect on the growth of canine glioma cells. In conclusion, NRG3/ERBB4 signaling is negatively regulated by miR-190a and contributes to the growth of canine glioma cells, indicating that it may be a promising therapeutic target in canine glioma.

Abstract: We previously found that ATP synthases localize to male-specific sensory cilia and control the ciliary response by regulating polycystin signalling in Caenorhabditis elegans. Herein, we discovered that the ciliary localization of ATP synthase is evolutionarily conserved in mammals. We showed that the ATP synthase subunit F1β is colocalized with the cilia marker acetylated α-tubulin in both mammalian renal epithelial cells (MDCK) and normal mouse cholangiocytes (NMCs). Treatment with ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin impaired ciliogenesis in MDCK cells, and F1β was co-immunoprecipitated with PKD2 in mammalian cells. Our study provides evidence for the evolutionarily conserved localization of ATP synthase in cilia from worm to mammals. Defects in ATP synthase can lead to ciliary dysfunction, which may be a potential mechanism of polycystic kidney disease.

Abstract: Summary
To develop a vaccine candidate against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we generated a lentiviral vector (LV) eliciting neutralizing antibodies against the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Systemic vaccination by this vector in mice, in which the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2 has been induced by transduction of respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral vector, confers only partial protection despite high levels of serum neutralizing activity. However, eliciting an immune response in the respiratory tract through an intranasal boost results in a >3 log10 decrease in the lung viral loads and reduces local inflammation. Moreover, both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms display strong vaccine efficacy and inhibit lung deleterious injury in golden hamsters, which are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and closely mirror human COVID-19 physiopathology. Our results provide evidence of marked prophylactic effects of LV-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and designate intranasal immunization as a powerful approach against COVID-19.

Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 causing the worldwide pandemic has changed people’s life in multiple aspects dramatically since it’s first identified in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. While the numbers of infected patients and death toll keep vigorous increasing, curbing the progression of the pandemic is an urgent goal. Efforts have been made to search for prophylactic and therapeutic approaches including neutralizing antibodies development. By reviewing dozens of studies on anti-spike antibodies identification, we concluded that (1) promising therapeutic antibodies are being fished out by various approaches, such as screening of single B cells of convalescent patients, recombinant antibody library and B cells of immunized animals; (2) the epitopes are mainly RBD, but also some non-RBD domains, without the requisite of overlapping with ACE2 binding sites; (3) Neutralizing antibodies are convergent to a few germline genes, including IGHV3-30, IGHV3-53, IGHV3-66, with varying levels of somatic mutations. This review summarizes the progress in neutralizing antibodies development and the germline enrichment of effective antibodies, which will shed light on COVID-19 treatment and vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies are essential tools in research and diagnostics. Although antibody fragments typically obtained from in vitro selection can be rapidly produced in bacteria, the generation of full-length antibodies or the modification of antibodies with probes is time and labor intensive. Protein ligation such as SpyTag technology could covalently attach domains and labels to antibody fragments equipped with a SpyTag. However, we found that the established periplasmic expression of antibody fragments in E. coli led to quantitative cleavage of the SpyTag by the proteases Tsp and OmpT. Here we report successful periplasmic expression of SpyTagged Fab fragments and demonstrate the coupling to separately prepared SpyCatcher modules. We used this modular toolbox of SpyCatcher proteins to generate reagents for a variety of immunoassays and measured their performance in comparison with traditional reagents. Furthermore, we demonstrate surface immobilization, high-throughput screening of antibody libraries, and rapid prototyping of antibodies based on modular antibody assembly.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, is undergoing constant mutation. Here, we utilized an integrative approach combining epidemiology, virus genome sequencing, clinical phenotyping, and experimental validation to locate mutations of clinical importance. We identified 35 recurrent variants, some of which are associated with clinical phenotypes related to severity. One variant, containing a deletion in the Nsp1-coding region (Δ500-532), was found in more than 20% of our sequenced samples and associates with higher RT-PCR cycle thresholds and lower serum IFN-β levels of infected patients. Deletion variants in this locus were found in 37 countries worldwide, and viruses isolated from clinical samples or engineered by reverse genetics with related deletions in Nsp1 also induce lower IFN-β responses in infected Calu-3 cells. Taken together, our virologic surveillance characterizes recurrent genetic diversity and identified mutations in Nsp1 of biological and clinical importance, which collectively may aid molecular diagnostics and drug design.

Abstract: Malignant melanoma (MM) causes 80% of skin cancer-related deaths and becomes the most lethal type of skin cancer. The molecular mechanism of MM is still not clear. This study aimed to reveal the relationship between MM and EIF3H. Clinical specimens were collected to preliminarily explore the role of EIF3H in MM. MM cell lines with EIF3H knockdown were constructed for investigating the effects of EIF3H on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and cell motility. Mice xenograft model was constructed for verification in vivo. We found that EIF3H was obviously upregulated in MM tissues compared with normal skin tissues, which was correlated with tumor stage and risk of lymphatic metastasis. The in vitro results indicated that silencing EIF3H in MM cells could significantly suppress cell proliferation, promote cell apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest. Moreover, EIF3H knockdown significantly restrained cell motility through regulating EMT-related proteins. The effects of EIF3H knockdown were also verified in mice xenograft model, which were represented by slower growth rate, smaller volume and lighter weight of tumors. Therefore, EIF3H was identified as a critical factor in the development and progression of MM which may be used as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of MM.

Abstract: Postovulatory oocyte aging has a major influence on the development potential of embryos. Many antioxidants can delay oocyte aging by regulating the expression of SIRT1. However, there is a lack of knowledge on SIRT1 function in postovulatory oocyte aging. In vitro transcribed RNA of Sirt1 was injected into fresh oocytes to investigate the function of SIRT1 during postovulatory oocyte aging. In the present study, SIRT1 was found to be down-regulated in aged oocytes compared with fresh oocytes. Meanwhile the intensity of acetylation of H3K9 (H3K9ac) and H3K4 methylation increased in postovulatory aged oocytes. After the oocytes were injected with SIRT1 and aged for 12 h, the intensity of H3K9ac and H3K4 methylation markedly decreased compared with controls. Furthermore, SIRT1 overexpression also reduced the aging-induced oocyte morphological changes and reactive oxygen species accumulation, maintained the spindle normal morphology and attenuated the aging-associated abnormalities of mitochondrial function. The role of SIRT1 in protecting oocyte aging was diminished when oocytes with overexpressed SIRT1 were cultured with SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527. Briefly, these present results show that SIRT1 not only reduced the non-epigenetic changes such as abnormal oocyte morphology, ROS accumulation, spindle defects and mitochondrial dysfunctions but also regulated the epigenetic changes in order to maintain the quality of postovulatory aged oocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The enhancer factors CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (also known as KAT3A and KAT3B) maintain gene expression programs through lysine acetylation of chromatin and transcriptional regulators and by scaffolding functions mediated by several protein-protein interaction domains. Small molecule inhibitors that target some of these domains have been developed; however, they cannot completely ablate p300/CBP function in cells. Here we describe a chemical degrader of p300/CBP, dCBP-1. Leveraging structures of ligand-bound p300/CBP domains, we use in silico modeling of ternary complex formation with the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon to enable degrader design. dCBP-1 is exceptionally potent at killing multiple myeloma cells and can abolish the enhancer that drives MYC oncogene expression. As an efficient degrader of this unique class of acetyltransferases, dCBP-1 is a useful tool alongside domain inhibitors for dissecting the mechanism by which these factors coordinate enhancer activity in normal and diseased cells.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental factors that enhance regeneration are largely unknown. The immune system and microbiome are attributed roles in repairing and regenerating structure but their precise interplay is unclear. Here, we assessed the function of skin bacteria in wound healing and wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN), a rare adult organogenesis model. WIHN levels and stem cell markers correlate with bacterial counts, being lowest in germ-free (GF), intermediate in conventional specific pathogen-free (SPF), and highest in wild-type mice, even those infected with pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Reducing skin microbiota via cage changes or topical antibiotics decreased WIHN. Inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and keratinocyte-dependent IL-1R-MyD88 signaling are necessary and sufficient for bacteria to promote regeneration. Finally, in a small trial, a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic also slowed skin wound healing in adult volunteers. These results demonstrate a role for IL-1β to control morphogenesis and support the need to reconsider routine applications of topical prophylactic antibiotics.

Abstract: Summary
The doubly labeled water (DLW) method measures total energy expenditure (TEE) in free-living subjects. Several equations are used to convert isotopic data into TEE. Using the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) DLW database (5,756 measurements of adults and children), we show considerable variability is introduced by different equations. The estimated rCO2 is sensitive to the dilution space ratio (DSR) of the two isotopes. Based on performance in validation studies, we propose a new equation based on a new estimate of the mean DSR. The DSR is lower at low body masses (<10 kg). Using data for 1,021 babies and infants, we show that the DSR varies non-linearly with body mass between 0 and 10 kg. Using this relationship to predict DSR from weight provides an equation for rCO2 over this size range that agrees well with indirect calorimetry (average difference 0.64%; SD = 12.2%). We propose adoption of these equations in future studies.

Abstract: The Ziziphus species are naturally tolerant to a range of abiotic stresses. Therefore, it is expected that they are an enriched source of genes conferring stress tolerance. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) play a significant role in plants in imparting tolerance against abiotic stress conditions. To get an insight into potential Hsp function in Ziziphus, we performed a genome-wide analysis and expression study of Hsp70 and Hsp100 gene families in Ziziphus jujuba. We identified 21 and 6 genes of the ZjHsp70 and ZjHsp100 families, respectively. Physiochemical properties, chromosomal location, gene structure, motifs, and protein domain organization were analysed for structural and functional characterization. We identified the contribution of tandem and segmental gene duplications in expansions of ZjHsp70s and ZjHsp100s in Z. jujuba. Promoter analysis suggested that ZjHsp70s and ZjHsp100s perform diverse functions related to abiotic stress. Furthermore, expression analyses revealed that most of the Z. jujuba Hsp genes are differentially expressed in response to heat, drought, and salinity stress. Our analyses suggested ZjHsp70-3, ZjHsp70-5, ZjHsp70-6, ZjHsp70-16, ZjHsp70-17, ZjHsp70-20, ZjHsp100-1, ZjHsp100-2, and ZjHsp100-3 are potential candidates for further functional analysis and with regard to breeding new more resilient strains. The present analysis laid the foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism of Hsps70 and Hsp100 gene families regulating abiotic stress tolerance in Z. jujuba.

Abstract: Objective: Atherosclerosis (AS) is an inflammatory disease and the formation of atherosclerotic plaque plays a critical role in AS progression. We aimed to investigate the effect of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) activated by DNA damage (NORAD)/microRNA-495-3p (miR-495-3p)/Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) axis on atherosclerotic plaque formation. Methods: The ApoE−/- mice were fed a high-fat diet to construct AS mouse models and the modeled mice were treated with altered NORAD, miR-495-3p or KLF5. NORAD, miR-495-3p and KLF5 expression in mouse aorta tissues were evaluated, and the levels of inflammatory factors, oxidative stress factors, endothelial function indices and blood lipid in mice were all determined. The atherosclerotic plaque area, lipid deposition area, collagen fibers and CD68 expression in mouse aorta tissues were assessed. The regulatory relation between NORAD and miR-495-3p, and the target relation between miR-495-3p and KLF5 were confirmed. Results: NORAD and KLF5 were increased whereas miR-495-3p was decreased in atherosclerotic mouse aortas. Inhibited NORAD or elevated miR-495-3p suppressed inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, blood lipid level, atherosclerotic plaque area, collagen fibers and CD68 expression in atherosclerotic mouse aortas. Effects of elevated miR-495-3p on atherosclerotic mice could be reversed by up-regulation of KLF5. NORAD served as a sponge of miR-495-3p and miR-495-3p directly targeted KLF5. Conclusion: Silenced NORAD elevated miR-495-3p to suppress atherosclerotic plaque formation via reducing KLF5. Findings in our research may be helpful for exploring molecular mechanisms of AS.
