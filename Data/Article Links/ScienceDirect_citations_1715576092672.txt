Abstract: Summary
DNA elements act across long genomic distances to regulate gene expression. During transvection in Drosophila, DNA elements on one allele of a gene act between chromosomes to regulate expression of the other allele. Little is known about the biological roles and developmental regulation of transvection. Here, we study the stochastic expression of spineless (ss) in photoreceptors in the fly eye to understand transvection. We determine a biological role for transvection in regulating expression of naturally occurring ss alleles. We identify DNA elements required for activating and repressing transvection. Different enhancers participate in transvection at different times during development to promote gene expression and specify cell fates. Bringing a silencer element on a heterologous chromosome into proximity with the ss locus “reconstitutes” the gene, leading to repression. Our studies show that transvection regulates gene expression via distinct DNA elements at specific timepoints in development, with implications for genome organization and architecture.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionary conserved CCR4-NOT complex functions in the cytoplasm as the main mRNA deadenylase in both constitutive mRNA turnover and regulated mRNA decay pathways. The versatility of this complex is underpinned by its modular multi-subunit organization, with distinct structural modules actuating different functions. The structure and function of all modules are known, except for that of the N-terminal module. Using different structural approaches, we obtained high-resolution data revealing the architecture of the human N-terminal module composed of CNOT1, CNOT10, and CNOT11. The structure shows how two helical domains of CNOT1 sandwich CNOT10 and CNOT11, leaving the most conserved domain of CNOT11 protruding into solvent as an antenna. We discovered that GGNBP2, a protein identified as a tumor suppressor and spermatogenic factor, is a conserved interacting partner of the CNOT11 antenna domain. Structural and biochemical analyses thus pinpoint the N-terminal CNOT1-CNOT10-CNOT11 module as a conserved protein-protein interaction platform.

Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder seen in women of reproductive age and has been gradually increasing over the years. The mechanism of the syndrome has still not been clearly understood. In this study, the possible effects of exogenously administrated melatonin on melatonin (MT1) receptor, Growth Differentiation Factor-9 (GDF9), and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-15 (BMP15) in experimental PCOS were investigated. Thirty-two 6–8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8 in each) as Sham control (Group 1), Melatonin (Group 2), PCOS (Group 3), and PCOS + Melatonin (Group 4) groups. At the end of the 21st day, the experiment was terminated, the ovary tissues were taken, and Hematoxylin-Eosin staining, MT1, GDF9, BMP15 immunohistochemical labeling, western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses were performed. Serum Luteinizing Hormone (LH)/Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels and colpo-cytological examinations were also carried out. The results revealed that melatonin administration increased the expression levels of the MT1 receptor, GDF9, and BMP15 in PCOS at protein and mRNA levels. It was determined that melatonin administration reduced the microscopic symptoms of PCOS. Melatonin was found to be effective via the MT1 receptor in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and it suppressed the transport pathways of GDF9 to granulosa cells in antral follicles.

Abstract: Summary
SPATA2 mediates the recruitment of CYLD to immune receptor complexes by bridging the interaction of CYLD with the linear ubiquitylation assembly complex (LUBAC) component HOIP. Whether SPATA2 exhibits functions independently of CYLD is unclear. Here, we show that, while Cyld−/− and Spata2−/− mice are viable, double mutants exhibit highly penetrant perinatal lethality, indicating independent functions of SPATA2 and CYLD. Cyld−/−Spata2−/− fibroblasts show increased M1-linked TNFR1-SC ubiquitylation and, similar to Cyld−/−Spata2−/− macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells, elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression compared with Cyld−/− or Spata2−/− cells. We show that SPATA2 competes with OTULIN for binding to HOIP via its PUB-interacting motif (PIM) and its zinc finger domain, thereby promoting autoubiquitylation of LUBAC. Consistently, increased pro-inflammatory signaling in Cyld−/−Spata2−/− cells depends on the presence of OTULIN. Our data therefore indicate that SPATA2 counteracts, independently of CYLD, the deubiquitylation of LUBAC by OTULIN and thereby attenuates LUBAC activity and pro-inflammatory signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) involves many RNA processing components, including SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6), and DICER-LIKE proteins (DCLs). Nonetheless, how these components are coordinated to produce siRNAs is unclear. Here, we show that SGS3 forms condensates via phase separation in vivo and in vitro. SGS3 interacts with RDR6 and drives it to form siRNA bodies in cytoplasm, which is promoted by SGS3-targeted RNAs. Disrupting SGS3 phase separation abrogates siRNA body assembly and siRNA biogenesis, whereas coexpression of SGS3 and RDR6 induces siRNA body formation in tobacco and yeast cells. Dysfunction in translation and mRNA decay increases the number of siRNA bodies, whereas DCL2/4 mutations enhance their size. Purification of SGS3 condensates identifies numerous RNA-binding proteins and siRNA processing components. Together, our findings reveal that SGS3 phase separation-mediated formation of siRNA bodies is essential for siRNA production and gene silencing.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity, particularly increased visceral fat, positively correlates with various metabolic challenges, including atherosclerosis, but the mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to determine the role of visceral-fat-derived exosomes (Exo) in endothelial cells and atherosclerosis. We show that obesity changes the miRNA profile of visceral adipose exosomes in mice. Importantly, exosomal miR-27b-3p efficiently enters into the vascular endothelial cells and activates the NF-κB pathway by downregulating PPARα. Mechanistically, miR-27b-3p binds directly to the CDS region of PPARα mRNA, thereby promoting mRNA degradation and suppressing translation. In ApoE-deficient mice, administration of miR-27b-3p mimic increases inflammation and atherogenesis, while overexpression of PPARα protects against atherosclerosis. Thus, obesity-induced exosomal miR-27b-3p promotes endothelial inflammation and facilitates atherogenesis by PPARα suppression. We reveal an exosomal pathway by which obesity aggravates atherosclerosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis in people with obesity.

Abstract: The main strategy of cancer cells for survival is uncontrolled cell division and escape from apoptosis. The use of anticancer agents inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and controlling cell division might be a therapeutic approach to eradicate cancer cells. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effects of Auraptene on CT26 cells as well as on a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). The spheroid assay was also conducted to analyze the anti-proliferative activity of Auraptene. We also assessed the in vitro analysis of ROS generation. The impact of Auraptene on oxidant/antioxidant markers, as well as the mRNA expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Nrf2, Cyclin D1, and Survivin genes, was evaluated by qPCR in tumor samples. As a result, Auraptene significantly reduced the size of CT26 spheroids at a dose of 200 µM. After 12 h, ROS levels were significantly elevated in CT26 cells. The administration of Auraptene induced apoptosis and the cell cycle arrest by modulating Bax, Bcl-2, Nrf2, Cyclin D1, and Survivin mRNA levels. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that Auraptene suppressed CAT, GSH (reduced Glutathione), and FRAP while increasing MDA in tissue homogenates which in turn could raise oxidative stress and stimulate apoptosis. Therefore, Auraptene may act as a powerful adjuvant therapy in CRC since it triggers apoptosis and cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical sequencing efforts are rapidly identifying sarcoma gene fusions that lack functional validation. An example is the fusion of transcriptional coactivators, VGLL2-NCOA2, found in infantile rhabdomyosarcoma. To delineate VGLL2-NCOA2 tumorigenic mechanisms and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities, we implement a cross-species comparative oncology approach with zebrafish, mouse allograft, and patient samples. We find that VGLL2-NCOA2 is sufficient to generate mesenchymal tumors that display features of immature skeletal muscle and recapitulate the human disease. A subset of VGLL2-NCOA2 zebrafish tumors transcriptionally cluster with embryonic somitogenesis and identify VGLL2-NCOA2 developmental programs, including a RAS family GTPase, ARF6. In VGLL2-NCOA2 zebrafish, mouse, and patient tumors, ARF6 is highly expressed. ARF6 knockout suppresses VGLL2-NCOA2 oncogenic activity in cell culture, and, more broadly, ARF6 is overexpressed in adult and pediatric sarcomas. Our data indicate that VGLL2-NCOA2 is an oncogene that leverages developmental programs for tumorigenesis and that reactivation or persistence of ARF6 could represent a therapeutic opportunity.

Abstract: Currently, the clinical outcome of cervical cancer (CC) is still undesirable, and it is urgent to explore more treatment strategies for CC. In this study, the effects of CENPU on migration and stemness of CC was studied. The CENPU expression were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The effects of CENPU on the viability and proliferation of cells were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay. Wound healing assay and invasion assay were chosen to assess migration and invasion of cells. Tumorsphere-forming assay was applied for testing the stemness. Western blot analysis was applied for assessing the level of CENPU, Nanog, Oct4, FOXM1, β-catenin, c-myc and MMP-7. The tumor sizes and volumes were also measured. The TCGA data and WB assay suggested that CENPU was upregulated in CC. CENPU knockdown would inhibit the viability of CC cells and prohibit the migration and invasion of cells. Tumorsphere-forming assay and WB results suggested that CENPU silencing decreased the sphere formation rate and the expression of Nanog and Oct4. Moreover, CENPU knockdown suppressed the expression of FOXM1, β-catenin, c-myc and MMP-7 by WB. In vivo study demonstrated that CENPU knockdown inhibited the growth of CC, indicated by reduced sizes and volumes of CC. In summary, our results suggested that knockdown of CENPU inhibited CC migration and stemness through the FOXM1/Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Abstract: Summary
ATM gene mutation carriers are predisposed to estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer (BC). ATM prevents BC oncogenesis by activating p53 in every cell; however, much remains unknown about tissue-specific oncogenesis after ATM loss. Here, we report that ATM controls the early transcriptional response to estrogens. This response depends on topoisomerase II (TOP2), which generates TOP2-DNA double-strand break (DSB) complexes and rejoins the breaks. When TOP2-mediated ligation fails, ATM facilitates DSB repair. After estrogen exposure, TOP2-dependent DSBs arise at the c-MYC enhancer in human BC cells, and their defective repair changes the activation profile of enhancers and induces the overexpression of many genes, including the c-MYC oncogene. CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage at the enhancer also causes c-MYC overexpression, indicating that this DSB causes c-MYC overexpression. Estrogen treatment induced c-Myc protein overexpression in mammary epithelial cells of ATM-deficient mice. In conclusion, ATM suppresses the c-Myc-driven proliferative effects of estrogens, possibly explaining such tissue-specific oncogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Lateral root (LR) initiation is controlled by the pericycle and the neighboring endodermis in Arabidopsis. Here, we demonstrate that UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE14/DA3 regulates LR initiation by modulating auxin signaling in the pericycle and endodermis. DA3 negatively affects the mRNA and protein levels of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 in the pericycle and endodermis but positively regulates the protein stability of SHORT HYPOCOTYL 2 (SHY2/IAA3), an auxin signaling repressor, in the endodermis. We show that DA3 interacts with ARF7 and ARF19, inhibiting their binding to the locus of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY DOMAIN16 (LBD16) to repress its expression in the pericycle. SHY2 also interacts with ARF7 and ARF19 in the endodermis and enhances the DA3 repressive effect on ARF7 and ARF19, thus modulating LBD16 expression in the pericycle. Overall, our findings show that DA3 acts with SHY2, ARF7, and ARF19 to coordinate auxin signaling in the pericycle and endodermis to control LR initiation in Arabidopsis.

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous and exogenous agents generate DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs), whose replication-dependent degradation by the SPRTN protease suppresses aging and liver cancer. SPRTN is activated after the replicative CMG helicase bypasses a DPC and polymerase extends the nascent strand to the adduct. Here, we identify a role for the 5′-to-3′ helicase FANCJ in DPC repair. In addition to supporting CMG bypass, FANCJ is essential for SPRTN activation. FANCJ binds ssDNA downstream of the DPC and uses its ATPase activity to unfold the protein adduct, which exposes the underlying DNA and enables cleavage of the adduct. FANCJ-dependent DPC unfolding is also essential for translesion DNA synthesis past DPCs that cannot be degraded. In summary, our results show that helicase-mediated protein unfolding enables multiple events in DPC repair.

Abstract: Summary
YAP1 functions in lineage differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs); however, the detailed mechanisms underlying the regulation of YAP1 activity during ESC differentiation remain elusive. Here, we report that hCINAP serves as a negative regulator of YAP1 during ESC fate decisions. The expression of mCINAP, the murine homolog of hCINAP, is downregulated during the differentiation process of murine ESC (mESC) ectoderm lineage, leading to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of NEDD4 and activation of YAP1. Mechanistically, hCINAP interacts with and prevents NEDD4 from forming cytoplasmic condensates that compartmentalize YAP1 and its kinase NLK, facilitating YAP1 phosphorylation at Ser128 and promoting YAP1 activation. mCINAP depletion leads to the formation of NEDD4 condensates and YAP1 activation, which impedes endoderm differentiation of mESCs. Our study shows that hCINAP is a vital regulator of YAP1 activity and is essential for stem cell fate decisions, which provides mechanistic insight into early embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cachexia is a disorder characterized by involuntary weight loss and impaired physical performance. Decline in physical performance of patients with cachexia is associated with poor quality of life, and currently there are no effective pharmacological interventions that restore physical performance. Here we examine the effect of GDF15 neutralization in a mouse model of cancer-induced cachexia (TOV21G) that manifests weight loss and muscle function impairments. With comprehensive assessments, our results demonstrate that cachectic mice treated with the anti-GDF15 antibody mAB2 exhibit body weight gain with near-complete restoration of muscle mass and markedly improved muscle function and physical performance. Mechanistically, the improvements induced by GDF15 neutralization are primarily attributed to increased caloric intake, while altered gene expression in cachectic muscles is restored in caloric-intake-dependent and -independent manners. The findings indicate potential of GDF15 neutralization as an effective therapy to enhance physical performance of patients with cachexia.

Abstract: Summary
In anamniote embryos, the major wave of zygotic genome activation starts during the mid-blastula transition. However, some genes escape global genome repression, are activated substantially earlier, and contribute to the minor wave of genome activation. The mechanisms underlying the minor wave of genome activation are little understood. We explored the genomic organization and cis-regulatory mechanisms of a transcription body, in which the minor wave of genome activation is first detected in zebrafish. We identified the miR-430 cluster as having excessive copy number and the highest density of Pol-II-transcribed promoters in the genome, and this is required for forming the transcription body. However, this transcription body is not essential for, nor does it encompasse, minor wave transcription globally. Instead, distinct minor-wave-specific promoter architecture suggests that promoter-autonomous mechanisms regulate the minor wave of genome activation. The minor-wave-specific features also suggest distinct transcription initiation mechanisms between the minor and major waves of genome activation.

Abstract: Summary
The antiviral pseudo-base T705 and its de-fluoro analog T1106 mimic adenine or guanine and can be competitively incorporated into nascent RNA by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Although dispersed, single pseudo-base incorporation is mutagenic, consecutive incorporation causes polymerase stalling and chain termination. Using a template encoding single and then consecutive T1106 incorporation four nucleotides later, we obtained a cryogenic electron microscopy structure of stalled influenza A/H7N9 polymerase. This shows that the entire product-template duplex backtracks by 5 nt, bringing the singly incorporated T1106 to the +1 position, where it forms an unexpected T1106:U wobble base pair. Similar structures show that influenza B polymerase also backtracks after consecutive T1106 incorporation, regardless of whether prior single incorporation has occurred. These results give insight into the unusual mechanism of chain termination by pyrazinecarboxamide base analogs. Consecutive incorporation destabilizes the proximal end of the product-template duplex, promoting irreversible backtracking to a more energetically favorable overall configuration.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common chronic and progressive lung disease. Fibulin-2 (FBLN2) is upregulated in patients with IPF; however, its exact role in IPF remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role and the regulatory mechanism of FBLN2 in TGF-β1-induced fibrogenesis using human lung fibroblast-derived MRC-5 cells. Cell transfection was performed to regulate FBLN2 expression. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyses were performed to detect the expression levels of FBLN2 and vitronectin (VTN). Cell viability and migration were determined via the Cell Counting Kit-8 and wound healing assays, respectively. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-positive cells. The STRING database was used to predict the interaction between FBLN2 and VTN, which was verified via the protein immunoprecipitation assay. The results demonstrated that inhibition of FBLN2 notably inhibited TGF-β1-induced proliferation and migration, as well as downregulating the protein expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 in MRC-5 cells. In addition, inhibition of FBLN2 suppressed the expression levels of α-SMA, collagen type 1 α1 and fibronectin. FBLN2 was demonstrated to bind to VTN and negatively regulate its expression. Furthermore, overexpression of VTN partly abolished the inhibitory effects of FBLN2 knockdown on TGF-β1-induced proliferation, migration and fibrosis, as well as the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that FBLN2 knockdown can attenuate TGF-β1-induced fibrosis in MRC-5 cells by downregulating VTN expression via FAK signaling. Thus, FBLN2 may be a potential therapeutic target for IPF treatment.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS is widely mutated in human cancers, resulting in unchecked tumor proliferation and metastasis, which makes identifying KRAS-targeting therapies a priority. Herein, we observe that mutant KRAS specifically promotes the formation of the ERK2-p53 complex in stomach/colorectal tumor cells. Disruption of this complex by applying MEK1/2 and ERK2 inhibitors elicits strong apoptotic responses in a p53-dependent manner, validated by genome-wide knockout screening. Mechanistically, p53 physically associates with phosphorylated ERK2 through a hydrophobic interaction in the presence of mutant KRAS, which suppresses p53 activation by preventing the recruitment of p300/CBP; trametinib disrupts the ERK2-p53 complex by reducing ERK2 phosphorylation, allowing the acetylation of p53 protein by recruiting p300/CBP; acetylated p53 activates PUMA transcription and thereby kills KRAS-mutant tumors. Our study shows an important role for the ERK2-p53 complex and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for treating KRAS-mutant cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The GATOR2-GATOR1 signaling axis is essential for amino-acid-dependent mTORC1 activation. However, the molecular function of the GATOR2 complex remains unknown. Here, we report that disruption of the Ring domains of Mios, WDR24, or WDR59 completely impedes amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation. Mechanistically, via interacting with Ring domains of WDR59 and WDR24, the Ring domain of Mios acts as a hub to maintain GATOR2 integrity, disruption of which leads to self-ubiquitination of WDR24. Physiologically, leucine stimulation dissociates Sestrin2 from the Ring domain of WDR24 and confers its availability to UBE2D3 and subsequent ubiquitination of NPRL2, contributing to GATOR2-mediated GATOR1 inactivation. As such, WDR24 ablation or Ring deletion prevents mTORC1 activation, leading to severe growth defects and embryonic lethality at E10.5 in mice. Hence, our findings demonstrate that Ring domains are essential for GATOR2 to transmit amino acid availability to mTORC1 and further reveal the essentiality of nutrient sensing during embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Current differentiation protocols have not been successful in reproducibly generating fully functional human beta cells in vitro, partly due to incomplete understanding of human pancreas development. Here, we present detailed transcriptomic analysis of the various cell types of the developing human pancreas, including their spatial gene patterns. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics at multiple developmental time points and revealed distinct temporal-spatial gene cascades. Cell trajectory inference identified endocrine progenitor populations and branch-specific genes as the progenitors differentiate toward alpha or beta cells. Spatial differentiation trajectories indicated that Schwann cells are spatially co-located with endocrine progenitors, and cell-cell connectivity analysis predicted that they may interact via L1CAM-EPHB2 signaling. Our integrated approach enabled us to identify heterogeneity and multiple lineage dynamics within the mesenchyme, showing that it contributed to the exocrine acinar cell state. Finally, we have generated an interactive web resource for investigating human pancreas development for the research community.

Abstract: Summary
More than 70 million tons of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are manufactured worldwide every year. The accumulation of PET waste has become a global pollution concern, motivating the urgent development of technologies to valorize post-consumer PET. The development of chemocatalytic and enzymatic approaches for depolymerizing PET to its corresponding monomers opens up new opportunities for PET upcycling through biological transformation. Here, we identify Rhodococcus jostii strain PET (RPET) that can directly use PET hydrolysate as a sole carbon source. We also investigate the potential of RPET to upcycle PET into value-added chemicals, using lycopene as a proof-of-concept product. Through rational metabolic engineering, we improve lycopene production by more than 500-fold over that of the wild type. In addition, we demonstrate the production of approximately 1,300 μg/L lycopene from PET by cascading this strain with PET alkaline hydrolysis. This work highlights the great potential of biological conversion as a means of achieving PET upcycling.

Abstract: Summary
Cachexia is a systemic wasting syndrome that increases cancer-associated mortality. How cachexia progressively and differentially impacts distinct tissues is largely unknown. Here, we find that the heart and skeletal muscle undergo wasting at early stages and are the tissues transcriptionally most impacted by cachexia. We also identify general and organ-specific transcriptional changes that indicate functional derangement by cachexia even in tissues that do not undergo wasting, such as the brain. Secreted factors constitute a top category of cancer-regulated genes in host tissues, and these changes include upregulation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE inhibition with the drug lisinopril improves muscle force and partially impedes cachexia-induced transcriptional changes, although wasting is not prevented, suggesting that cancer-induced host-secreted factors can regulate tissue function during cachexia. Altogether, by defining prevalent and temporal and tissue-specific responses to cachexia, this resource highlights biomarkers and possible targets for general and tissue-tailored anti-cachexia therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) represent ∼75% of RCC cases and account for most RCC-associated deaths. Inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) results in varying prognosis and treatment outcomes. To obtain the most comprehensive profile of ccRCC, we perform integrative histopathologic, proteogenomic, and metabolomic analyses on 305 ccRCC tumor segments and 166 paired adjacent normal tissues from 213 cases. Combining histologic and molecular profiles reveals ITH in 90% of ccRCCs, with 50% demonstrating immune signature heterogeneity. High tumor grade, along with BAP1 mutation, genome instability, increased hypermethylation, and a specific protein glycosylation signature define a high-risk disease subset, where UCHL1 expression displays prognostic value. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing of the adverse sarcomatoid and rhabdoid phenotypes uncover gene signatures and potential insights into tumor evolution. In vitro cell line studies confirm the potential of inhibiting identified phosphoproteome targets. This study molecularly stratifies aggressive histopathologic subtypes that may inform more effective treatment strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Phenotypic associations have been reported between blood cell traits (BCTs) and a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders (NPDs), but in most cases, it remains unclear whether these associations have a genetic basis and, if so, to what extent genetic correlations reflect causality. Here, we report genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses between 11 NPDs and 29 BCTs, using genome-wide association study summary statistics. We found significant genetic correlations for four BCT-NPD pairs, all of which have prior evidence for a phenotypic correlation. We identified a previously unreported causal effect of increased platelet distribution width on susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease. We identified multiple functional genes and regulatory elements for specific BCT-NPD pairs, some of which are targets of known drugs. These results enrich our understanding of the shared genetic landscape underlying BCTs and NPDs and provide a robust foundation for future work to improve prognosis and treatment of common NPDs.

Abstract: Summary
RIG-I is essential for host defense against viral pathogens, as it triggers the release of type I interferons upon encounter with viral RNA molecules. In this study, we show that RIG-I is rapidly and efficiently activated by small quantities of incoming viral RNA and that it relies exclusively on the constitutively expressed resident pool of RIG-I receptors for a strong antiviral response. Live-cell imaging of RIG-I following stimulation with viral or synthetic dsRNA reveals that RIG-I signaling occurs without mass aggregation at the mitochondrial membrane. By contrast, interferon-induced RIG-I protein becomes embedded in cytosolic aggregates that are functionally unrelated to signaling. These findings suggest that endogenous RIG-I efficiently recognizes viral RNA and rapidly relays an antiviral signal to MAVS via a transient signaling complex and that cellular aggregates of RIG-I have a function that is distinct from signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Preterm birth, the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, frequently results from the syndrome of preterm labor. The best-established causal link to preterm labor is intra-amniotic infection, which involves premature activation of the parturition cascade in the reproductive tissues. Herein, we utilize single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a single-cell atlas of the murine uterus, decidua, and cervix in a model of infection-induced preterm labor. We show that preterm labor affects the transcriptomic profiles of specific immune and non-immune cell subsets. Shared and tissue-specific gene expression signatures are identified among affected cells. Determination of intercellular communications implicates specific cell types in preterm labor-associated signaling pathways across tissues. In silico comparison of murine and human uterine cell-cell interactions reveals conserved signaling pathways implicated in labor. Thus, our scRNA-seq data provide insights into the preterm labor-driven cellular landscape and communications in reproductive tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical force is crucial in guiding axon outgrowth before and after synapse formation. This process is referred to as “stretch growth.” However, how neurons transduce mechanical input into signaling pathways remains poorly understood. Another open question is how stretch growth is coupled in time with the intercalated addition of new mass along the entire axon. Here, we demonstrate that active mechanical force generated by magnetic nano-pulling induces remodeling of the axonal cytoskeleton. Specifically, the increase in the axonal density of microtubules induced by nano-pulling leads to an accumulation of organelles and signaling vesicles, which, in turn, promotes local translation by increasing the probability of assembly of the “translation factories.” Modulation of axonal transport and local translation sustains enhanced axon outgrowth and synapse maturation.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer and often has a fatal course. There are many studies in the literature that have described a close functional relationship between the tumor mass and surrounding tissue, or tumor stroma, which is affected by the continuous metabolic exchange that occurs at the interface between tumor and tissues in contact with it. There is much evidence that the presence of adipose tissue in stroma plays a fundamental role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor development, growth, and angiogenesis due to its endocrine characteristics. In this analysis, we have studied the alterations of adipose tissue surrounding colorectal tumors with MRI and optical imaging in vivo techniques to monitor tumor progression and also performed histological and molecular analysis. We detected differences in the principal adipose markers expressed by adipocytes residing around the rectal colon and observed that peritumoral adipose tissue is exposed to a mesenchymal transition process that leads to the acquisition of a less differentiated phenotype of adipocyte that represents the main cellular type present in tumor stroma. The mesenchymal transition correlated with the acquisition of more aggressive tumor phenotype and could represent a valid target for tumor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant gliomas are aggressive, hard-to-treat brain tumors. Their tumor microenvironment is massively infiltrated by myeloid cells, mostly brain-resident microglia, bone marrow (BM)-derived monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells that support tumor progression. Single-cell omics studies significantly dissected immune cell heterogeneity, but dynamics and specific functions of individual subpopulations were poorly recognized. We use Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) to precisely dissect myeloid cell identities and functionalities in murine GL261 gliomas. We demonstrate that the diversity of myeloid cells infiltrating gliomas is dictated by cell type and cell state. Glioma-activated microglia are the major source of cytokines attracting other immune cells, whereas BM-derived cells show the monocyte-to-macrophage transition in the glioma microenvironment. This transition is coupled with a phenotypic switch from the IFN-related to antigen-presentation and tumor-supportive gene expression. Moreover, we found sex-dependent differences in transcriptional programs and composition of myeloid cells in murine and human glioblastomas.

Abstract: Summary
Advanced mass spectrometry methods have detected thousands of post-translational phosphorylation and acetylation sites in bacteria, but their functional role and the enzymes catalyzing these modifications remain largely unknown. In addition to enzymatic acetylation, lysine residues can also be chemically acetylated by the metabolite acetyl phosphate. In Escherichia coli, acetylation at over 3,000 sites has been linked to acetyl phosphate, but the functionality of this widespread non-enzymatic acetylation is even less clear than the enzyme-catalyzed one. Here, we investigate the role of acetyl-phosphate-mediated acetylation in E. coli central metabolism. Out of 19 enzymes investigated, only GapA and GpmA are acetylated at high stoichiometry, which inhibits their activity by interfering with substrate binding, effectively reducing glycolysis when flux to or from acetate is high. Extrapolating our results to the whole proteome, maximally 10% of the reported non-enzymatically acetylated proteins are expected to reach a stoichiometry that could inhibit their activity.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoediting sculpts immunogenicity and thwarts host anti-tumor responses in tumor cells during tumorigenesis; however, it remains unknown whether metabolic programming of tumor cells can be guided by immunosurveillance. Here, we report that T cell-mediated immunosurveillance in early-stage tumorigenesis instructs c-Myc upregulation and metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells. This previously unexplored tumor-immune interaction is controlled by non-canonical interferon gamma (IFNγ)-STAT3 signaling and supports tumor immune evasion. Our findings uncover that immunoediting instructs deregulated bioenergetic programs in tumor cells to empower them to disarm the T cell-mediated immunosurveillance by imposing metabolic tug-of-war between tumor and infiltrating T cells and forming the suppressive tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Genes are typically assumed to express both parental alleles similarly, yet cell lines show random allelic expression (RAE) for many autosomal genes that could shape genetic effects. Thus, understanding RAE in human tissues could improve our understanding of phenotypic variation. Here, we develop a methodology to perform genome-wide profiling of RAE and biallelic expression in GTEx datasets for 832 people and 54 tissues. We report 2,762 autosomal genes with some RAE properties similar to randomly inactivated X-linked genes. We found that RAE is associated with rapidly evolving regions in the human genome, adaptive signaling processes, and genes linked to age-related diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. We define putative mechanistic subtypes of RAE distinguished by gene overlaps on sense and antisense DNA strands, aggregation in clusters near telomeres, and increased regulatory complexity and inputs compared with biallelic genes. We provide foundations to study RAE in human phenotypes, evolution, and disease.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor p53 suppresses tumorigenesis via a wide-ranging, concerted set of functions. Although several studies have identified cytoplasmic, transcription-independent functions of p53, the biological relevance of these activities has not been fully elucidated, particularly in vivo. Here, we generated a mouse model with a p53K316P mutation, which mimics a naturally occurring p53 nuclear localization signal (NLS) change observed in bat species. We find that the p53K316P mutation increases cytoplasmic localization of p53 and promotes a pleiotropic metabolic phenotype that includes increased adiposity, increased de novo lipogenesis, and decreased lactate generation. Mechanistic studies show that, independent of its transactivation function, p53K316P interacts with lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and alters the composition and enzymatic activities of LDH complex favoring pyruvate generation and hindering lactate production. Overall, the study identifies a role for cytoplasmic p53 in the regulation of metabolism that favors energy generation and storage.

Abstract: Summary
Many spliceosomal introns are excised from nascent transcripts emerging from RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). The extent of cell-type-specific regulation and possible functions of such co-transcriptional events remain poorly understood. We examined the role of the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 in this process using an acute depletion approach followed by the analysis of chromatin- and RNA Pol II-associated transcripts. We show that PTBP1 activates the co-transcriptional excision of hundreds of introns, a surprising effect given that this protein is known to promote intron retention. Importantly, some co-transcriptionally activated introns fail to complete their splicing without PTBP1. In a striking example, retention of a PTBP1-dependent intron triggers nonsense-mediated decay of transcripts encoding DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B. We provide evidence that this regulation facilitates the natural decline in DNMT3B levels in developing neurons and protects differentiation-specific genes from ectopic methylation. Thus, PTBP1-activated co-transcriptional splicing is a widespread phenomenon mediating epigenetic control of cellular identity.

Abstract: Summary
TET2 haploinsufficiency is a driving event in myeloid cancers and is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Enhancing residual TET2 activity using vitamin C increases oxidized 5-methylcytosine (mC) formation and promotes active DNA demethylation via base excision repair (BER), which slows leukemia progression. We utilize genetic and compound library screening approaches to identify rational combination treatment strategies to improve use of vitamin C as an adjuvant therapy for AML. In addition to increasing the efficacy of several US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, vitamin C treatment with poly-ADP-ribosyl polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) elicits a strong synergistic effect to block AML self-renewal in murine and human AML models. Vitamin-C-mediated TET activation combined with PARPis causes enrichment of chromatin-bound PARP1 at oxidized mCs and γH2AX accumulation during mid-S phase, leading to cell cycle stalling and differentiation. Given that most AML subtypes maintain residual TET2 expression, vitamin C could elicit broad efficacy as a PARPi therapeutic adjuvant.

Abstract: Microgravity is known negatively affect physiology of living beings, including hematopoiesis. Dysregulation of hematopoietic cells and supporting stroma relationships in bone marrow niche may be in charge. We compared the efficacy of ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in presence of native or osteocommitted MSCs under simulated microgravity (Smg) using Random Positioning Machine (RPM). In comparison with 1 g, a decrease of MSC-associated HSPCs and an increase of floating HSPCs was observed after 7 days of Smg exposure. Among floating HSPCs, primitive progenitors were presented by late CD34+/133–. Total CFUs as well as erythroid (BFU-E) and granulocytic (CFU-G) numbers were lower. MSC-associated primitive HSPCs demonstrated increased proportion of late CD34+/133- in expense of early CD34-/133+. Osteo-MSCs preferentially supported late primitive CD34+ and more committed HSPCs as followed from increase of CFUs, and CD235a+ erythroid progenitors. Under Smg, an increased VEGF, eotaxin, and GRO-a levels, and a decrease in RANTES were found in the osteo-MSC-HSPC co-cultures. IL-6,-8, -13, G-CSF, GRO-a, MCP-3, MIP-1b, VEGF increased in co-culture with osteo-MSCs vs intact MSCs. Based on the findings, the misbalance between primitive/committed HSPCs and a decrease in hematopoiesis-supportive activity of osteocommitted cells are supposed to underline hematopoietic disorders during space flights.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses must overcome the interferon-mediated antiviral response to replicate and propagate into their host. Rabies virus (RABV) phosphoprotein P is known to inhibit interferon induction. Here, using a global mass spectrometry approach, we show that RABV P binds to TBK1, a kinase located at the crossroads of many interferon induction pathways, resulting in innate immunity inhibition. Mutations of TBK1 phosphorylation sites abolish P binding. Importantly, we demonstrate that upon RABV infection or detection of dsRNA by innate immunity sensors, TBK1 and its adaptor proteins NAP1 and SINTBAD form dynamic cytoplasmic condensates that have liquid properties. These condensates can form larger aggregates having ring-like structures in which NAP1 and TBK1 exhibit locally restricted movement. P binding to TBK1 interferes with the formation of these structures. This work demonstrates that proteins of the signaling pathway leading to interferon induction transiently form liquid organelles that can be targeted by viruses.

Abstract: NAADP (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is a second messenger, releasing Ca2+ from acidic calcium stores such as endosomes and lysosomes. PI(3,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate) is a phospho-inositide, residing on endolysosomal membranes and likewise releasing Ca2+ from endosomes and lysosomes. Both compounds have been shown to activate endolysosomal two-pore channels (TPCs) in mammalian cells. However, their effects on ion permeability as demonstrated specifically for TPC2 differ. While PI(3,5)P2 elicits predominantly Na+-selective currents, NAADP increases the Ca2+ permeability of the channel. What happens when both compounds are applied simultaneously was unclear until recently

Abstract: Summary
Cellular circadian clocks direct a daily transcriptional program that supports homeostasis and resilience. Emerging evidence has demonstrated age-associated changes in circadian functions. To define age-dependent changes at the systems level, we profile the circadian transcriptome in the hypothalamus, lung, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, and adrenal gland in three age groups. We find age-dependent and tissue-specific clock output changes. Aging reduces the number of rhythmically expressed genes (REGs), indicative of weakened circadian control. REGs are enriched for the hallmarks of aging, adding another dimension to our understanding of aging. Analyzing differential gene expression within a tissue at four different times of day identifies distinct clusters of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Increased variability of gene expression across the day is a common feature of aged tissues. This analysis extends the landscape for understanding aging and highlights the impact of aging on circadian clock function and temporal changes in gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Alkaliptosis, a type of regulated cell death driven by intracellular alkalization, was first described in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells after treatment with the opioid analgesic drug JTC801. Here, we used mass-spectrometry-based drug target identification, cellular thermal shift assay, and point mutation technologies to reveal ATP6V0D1 as a direct JTC801 target that drives alkaliptosis in human PDAC cells. Functionally, the protein stability of ATP6V0D1, when mediated by JTC801, increases the interaction between ATP6V0D1 and STAT3, resulting in increased expression and activity of STAT3 for sustaining lysosome homeostasis. Consequently, the pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 restores the sensitivity of ATP6V0D1-deficient cells to alkaliptosis in vitro or in suitable mouse models. Clinically, a high expression of ATP6V0D1 correlates with prolonged survival of patients with PDAC. Together, these results illustrate a link between ATP6V0D1 and PDAC and advance our understanding of alkaliptosis in targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing skin disease accompanied by recurrent itching. Although type 2 inflammation is dominant in allergic skin inflammation, it is not fully understood how non-type 2 inflammation co-exists with type 2 inflammation or how type 2 inflammation causes itching. We have recently established the FADS mouse, a mouse model of AD. In FADS mice, either genetic disruption or pharmacological inhibition of periostin, a downstream molecule of type 2 inflammation, inhibits NF-κB activation in keratinocytes, leading to downregulating eczema, epidermal hyperplasia, and infiltration of neutrophils, without regulating the enhanced type 2 inflammation. Moreover, inhibition of periostin blocks spontaneous firing of superficial dorsal horn neurons followed by a decrease in scratching behaviors due to itching. Taken together, periostin links NF-κB-mediated inflammation with type 2 inflammation and promotes itching in allergic skin inflammation, suggesting that periostin is a promising therapeutic target for AD.

Abstract: Evidence shows that some class I human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are related to durable HIV controls. The T18A TCR, which has the alloreactivity between HLA-B∗42:01 and HLA-B∗81:01 and the cross-reactivity with different antigen mutants, can sustain long-term HIV controls. Here the structural basis of the T18A TCR binding to the immunodominant HIV epitope TL9 (TPQDLNTML180-188) presented by HLA-B∗42:01 was determined and compared to T18A TCR binding to the TL9 presented by the allo-HLA-B∗81:01. For differences between HLA-B∗42:01 and HLA-B∗81:01, the CDR1α and CDR3α loops adopt a small rearrangement to accommodate them. For different conformations of the TL9 presented by different HLA alleles, not like the conventional recognition of CDR3s to interact with peptide antigens, CDR3β of the T18A TCR shifts to avoid the peptide antigen but intensively recognizes the HLA only, which is different with other conventional TCR structures. Featured sequence pairs of CDR3β and HLA might account for this and were additionally found in multiple other diseases indicating the popularity of the unconventional recognition pattern which would give insights into the control of diseases with epitope mutating such as HIV.

Abstract: Summary
Protein quality control is important for healthy aging and is dysregulated in age-related diseases. The autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome are key for proteostasis, but it remains largely unknown whether other proteolytic systems also contribute to maintain proteostasis during aging. Here, we find that expression of proteolytic enzymes (proteases/peptidases) distinct from the autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome systems declines during skeletal muscle aging in Drosophila. Age-dependent protease downregulation undermines proteostasis, as demonstrated by the increase in detergent-insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins and pathogenic huntingtin-polyQ levels in response to protease knockdown. Computational analyses identify the transcription factor Ptx1 (homologous to human PITX1/2/3) as a regulator of protease expression. Consistent with this model, Ptx1 protein levels increase with aging, and Ptx1 RNAi counteracts the age-associated downregulation of protease expression. Moreover, Ptx1 RNAi improves muscle protein quality control in a protease-dependent manner and extends lifespan. These findings indicate that proteases and their transcriptional modulator Ptx1 ensure proteostasis during aging.

Abstract: Objective
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe disease in newborns, this study aimed to investigate the protective effect of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) on NEC and its possible mechanism.
Methods
In vivo, the mice were divided into the control, NEC, and NEC+DMF group. The NEC model was established by artificial feeding, hypoxic for 4 days, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation on day 2 and day 3. DMF (25 mg/kg/d) was administered to NEC mice on day 1 and day 3. On the 11th day, the blood and intestinal tissues of mice were taken for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), pathological examination, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemical (IHC) detection. In vitro, human colorectal cells (FHC) were induced by LPS (100 ng/mL) and was divided into the control, LPS, and LPS+DMF group. The effect of DMF (20 μM) on cell viability and TLR4 signal transduction was detected by MTT and RT-qPCR, respectively.
Results
Compared to the NEC mice, DMF attenuated NEC-induced weight loss and abdominal distension diarrhea in mice, and alleviated NEC-induced intestinal pathological injuries. In addition, DMF reduced the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, NF-κB, and TLR4 in NEC mice intestinal tissues. Furthermore, DMF inhibited NEC-induced intestinal cell apoptosis as well as the protein expression of BCL2-Associated X (BAX), caspase-3, caspase-9, and increased Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) expression. In vitro, DMF improved cell viability, and restrained NF-κB and TLR4 expression in LPS-induced NEC cells.
Conclusion
DMF has a protective effect against intestine damage of NEC, which is related to the inhibition of the TLR signaling pathway, alleviating the inflammatory response.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperinsulinemia often precedes type 2 diabetes. Palmitoylation, implicated in exocytosis, is reversed by acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1). APT1 biology was altered in pancreatic islets from humans with type 2 diabetes, and APT1 knockdown in nondiabetic islets caused insulin hypersecretion. APT1 knockout mice had islet autonomous increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that was associated with prolonged insulin granule fusion. Using palmitoylation proteomics, we identified Scamp1 as an APT1 substrate that localized to insulin secretory granules. Scamp1 knockdown caused insulin hypersecretion. Expression of a mutated Scamp1 incapable of being palmitoylated in APT1-deficient cells rescued insulin hypersecretion and nutrient-induced apoptosis. High-fat-fed islet-specific APT1-knockout mice and global APT1-deficient db/db mice showed increased β cell failure. These findings suggest that APT1 is regulated in human islets and that APT1 deficiency causes insulin hypersecretion leading to β cell failure, modeling the evolution of some forms of human type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-based intravesical immunotherapy has been applied as gold standard treatment for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) for almost half a century. However, several patients with high-risk disease experience relapse, including those whose condition has worsened and who failed to respond to BCG. Non-significant therapeutic options have been developed for these at-risk patients, for many years. Immunotherapies have shown promising outcomes for bladder cancer treatment. Accordingly, our research group developed the OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1) immunotherapy, which has shown positive outcomes in NMIBC treatment. The aim of the current study is to describe, in details, the physicochemical features and potential action mechanisms of OncoTherad® nano-immunotherapy, based on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated interferon and on RANK/RANKL signaling pathways, in animal model with NMIBC. Based on the current findings, OncoTherad® nano-immunotherapy did not have genotoxic effect on the investigated model and did not show signs of limiting local and/or systemic toxicity at therapeutic doses. OncoTherad® nano-immunotherapy was more effective than the BCG treatment, since it reduced by 70% the malignancy rate. Furthermore, it was possible identifying an important action mechanism of OncoTherad®, which was based on the modulation of TLR4-mediated interferon and RANK/RANKL signaling pathways that, altogether, were essential to reduce malignancy rate. OncoTherad® mechanisms in these pathways helped preventing tumor recurrence.

Abstract: Summary
Carcinoma dissemination can occur when heterogeneous tumor and tumor-stromal cell clusters migrate together via collective migration. Cells at the front lead and direct collective migration, yet how these leader cells form and direct migration are not fully appreciated. From live videos of primary mouse and human breast tumor organoids in a 3D microfluidic system mimicking native breast tumor microenvironment, we developed 3D computational models, which hypothesize that leader cells need to generate high protrusive forces and overcome extracellular matrix (ECM) resistance at the leading edge. From single-cell sequencing analyses, we find that leader cells are heterogeneous and identify and isolate a keratin 14- and cadherin-3-positive subpopulation sufficient to lead collective migration. Cdh3 controls leader cell protrusion dynamics through local production of laminin, which is required for integrin/focal adhesion function. Our findings highlight how a subset of leader cells interact with the microenvironment to direct collective migration.

Abstract: Summary
The diversity of mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) subpopulations across tissues is one of the key physiological characteristics of the immune system. Here, we focus on understanding the metabolic variability of MNPs through metabolic network analysis applied to three large-scale transcriptional datasets: we introduce (1) an ImmGen MNP open-source dataset of 337 samples across 26 tissues; (2) a myeloid subset of ImmGen Phase I dataset (202 MNP samples); and (3) a myeloid mouse single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset (51,364 cells) assembled based on Tabula Muris Senis. To analyze such large-scale datasets, we develop a network-based computational approach, genes and metabolites (GAM) clustering, for unbiased identification of the key metabolic subnetworks based on transcriptional profiles. We define 9 metabolic subnetworks that encapsulate the metabolic differences within MNP from 38 different tissues. Obtained modules reveal that cholesterol synthesis appears particularly active within the migratory dendritic cells, while glutathione synthesis is essential for cysteinyl leukotriene production by peritoneal and lung macrophages.

Abstract: Recent structural studies have shown that the carboxyl-terminus of many TRP channels, including TRPC3, are folded into a horizontal rib helix that is connected to the vertical pole helix, which play roles in inter-structural interactions and multimerization. In a previous work we identified I807 located in the pole helix with a role in regulation of TRPC3 by STIM1 (Lee et al., 2014, Liu et al., 2022). To further determine the role of the pole helix in TRPC3 function, here we identified key hydrophobic residues in the pole helix that form tight tunnel-like structure and used mutations to probe their role in TRPC3 regulation by Ca2+ and Calmodulin. Our findings suggest that the hydrophobic starch formed by the I807-L818 residues has several roles, it modulates gating of TRPC3 by Ca2+, affects channel selectivity and the channel Ca2+ permeability. Mutations of I807, I811, L814 and L818 all attenuated the Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of TRPC3, with I807 having the most prominent effect. The extent of modulation of the CDI depended on the degree of hydrophobicity of I807. Moreover, the TRPC3(I807S) mutant showed altered channel monovalent ion selectivity and increased Ca2+ permeability, without affecting the channel permeability to Mg2+ and Ba2+ and without changing the pore diameter. The CDI of TRPC3 was reduced by an inactive calmodulin mutant and by a pharmacological inhibitor of calmodulin, which was eliminated by the I807S mutation. Notably, deletion of STIM1 caused similar alteration of TRPC3 properties. Taken together, these findings reveal a role of the pole helix in CDI, in addition to its potential role in channel multimerization that required gating of TRPC3 by STIM1. Since all TRPC and most TRP channels have pole helix structures, our findings raise the possibility that the pole helix may have similar roles in all the TRP family.

Abstract: Summary
Integrated molecular analysis of human cancer has yielded molecular classification for precise management of cancer patients. Here, we analyzed the whole genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data of 155 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). Multi-omics analysis led to the classification of ESCCs into four subtypes: cell cycle pathway activation, NRF2 oncogenic activation, immune suppression (IS), and immune modulation (IM). IS and IM cases were highly immune infiltrated but differed in the type and distribution of immune cells. IM cases showed better response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy than other subtypes in a clinical trial. We further developed a classifier with 28 features to identify the IM subtype, which predicted anti-PD-1 therapy response with 85.7% sensitivity and 90% specificity. These results emphasize the clinical value of unbiased molecular classification based on multi-omics data and have the potential to further improve the understanding and treatment of ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has heralded a new era in cancer therapy. Research into the mechanisms underlying response to ICB has predominantly focused on T cells; however, effective immune responses require tightly regulated crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune cells. Here, we combine unbiased analysis of blood and tumors from metastatic breast cancer patients treated with ICB with mechanistic studies in mouse models of breast cancer. We observe an increase in systemic and intratumoral eosinophils in patients and mice responding to ICB treatment. Mechanistically, ICB increased IL-5 production by CD4+ T cells, stimulating elevated eosinophil production from the bone marrow, leading to systemic eosinophil expansion. Additional induction of IL-33 by ICB-cisplatin combination or recombinant IL-33 promotes intratumoral eosinophil infiltration and eosinophil-dependent CD8+ T cell activation to enhance ICB response. This work demonstrates the critical role of eosinophils in ICB response and provides proof-of-principle for eosinophil engagement to enhance ICB efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Both upregulation and downregulation by cis-regulatory elements help modulate precise gene expression. However, our understanding of repressive elements is far more limited than activating elements. To address this gap, we characterized RE1, a group of transcriptional silencers bound by REST, at genome-wide scale using a modified massively parallel reporter assay (MPRAduo). MPRAduo empirically defined a minimal binding strength of REST (REST motif-intrinsic value [m-value]), above which cofactors colocalize and silence transcription. We identified 1,500 human variants that alter RE1 silencing and found that their effect sizes are predictable when they overlap with REST-binding sites above the m-value. Additionally, we demonstrate that non-canonical REST-binding motifs exhibit silencer function only if they precisely align half sites with specific spacer lengths. Our results show mechanistic insights into RE1, which allow us to predict its activity and effect of variants on RE1, providing a paradigm for performing genome-wide functional characterization of transcription-factor-binding sites.

Abstract: Summary
The human population is aging, and the need for interventions to slow progression of age-related diseases (geroprotective interventions) is growing. Repurposing compounds already used clinically, usually at modified doses, allows rapid implementation of geroprotective pharmaceuticals. Here we find the anti-retroviral nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine robustly extends lifespan and health span in C. elegans, independent of electron transport chain impairment or ROS accumulation. Rather, zidovudine treatment modifies pyrimidine metabolism and transcripts related to proteostasis. Testing regulators of mitochondrial stress and proteostasis shows that lifespan extension is dependent on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4). ATF-4 regulates longevity induced by mitochondrial stress, specifically communication between mitochondrial and cytosolic translation. Translation is reduced in zidovudine-treated worms, also dependent on ATF-4. Finally, we show ATF-4-dependent lifespan extension induced by didanosine, another NRTI. Altogether, our work elucidates the geroprotective effects of NRTIs such as zidovudine in vivo, via reduction of translation and ATF-4.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their cytotoxic capacity, neutrophils are often co-opted by cancers to promote immunosuppression, tumor growth, and metastasis. Consequently, these cells have received little attention as potential cancer immunotherapeutic agents. Here, we demonstrate in mouse models that neutrophils can be harnessed to induce eradication of tumors and reduce metastatic seeding through the combined actions of tumor necrosis factor, CD40 agonist, and tumor-binding antibody. The same combination activates human neutrophils in vitro, enabling their lysis of human tumor cells. Mechanistically, this therapy induces rapid mobilization and tumor infiltration of neutrophils along with complement activation in tumors. Complement component C5a activates neutrophils to produce leukotriene B4, which stimulates reactive oxygen species production via xanthine oxidase, resulting in oxidative damage and T cell-independent clearance of multiple tumor types. These data establish neutrophils as potent anti-tumor immune mediators and define an inflammatory pathway that can be harnessed to drive neutrophil-mediated eradication of cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal colorectal cancer (mCRC) is microsatellite stable (MSS), highly desmoplastic, with CD8+ T cells excluded to the stromal periphery, resistant to immunotherapy, and driven by low levels of the atypical protein kinase Cs (aPKCs) in the intestinal epithelium. We show here that a salient feature of these tumors is the accumulation of hyaluronan (HA) which, along with reduced aPKC levels, predicts poor survival. HA promotes epithelial heterogeneity and the emergence of a tumor fetal metaplastic cell (TFMC) population endowed with invasive cancer features through a network of interactions with activated fibroblasts. TFMCs are sensitive to HA deposition, and their metaplastic markers have prognostic value. We demonstrate that in vivo HA degradation with a clinical dose of hyaluronidase impairs mCRC tumorigenesis and liver metastasis and enables immune checkpoint blockade therapy by promoting the recruitment of B and CD8+ T cells, including a proportion with resident memory features, and by blocking immunosuppression.

Abstract: The extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in plaques and associated neurodegeneration are the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These plaques are surrounded by microglia—the resident tissue macrophages of the brain parenchyma that originate from primitive macrophages from the embryonic yolk sac. Microglia, including a unique subpopulation called “disease-associated microglia” (DAM), are strongly implicated in AD pathology; however, their exact function and physiology remain largely unknown. Notably, simple cell and tissue culture systems that adequately recreate the brain microenvironment and can simulate critical aspects of AD pathology could fundamentally contribute to elucidating microglial function in disease development and progression. Thus, we added human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-induced primitive macrophages (hiMacs) to hiPSC-induced cortical neurons (cell model) and cortical organoids (tissue model). The treatment of these culture systems with the O-acyl isopeptide of Aβ1−42, which reverts to natural extracellular Aβ1−42 at neutral pH and starts self-aggregation, caused the degeneration of hiPSC-induced cortical neurons in 2D culture and within cortical organoid cultures. Notably, the hiMacs phagocytosed extracellular Aβ and exhibited a DAM-like phenotype. In both cell and tissue organoid culture systems, neurodegeneration was attenuated by the addition of hiMacs. Moreover, in cortical organoids, Aβ plaques formed more circular and fewer hotspot-like morphological structures in the vicinity of hiMacs. These findings demonstrate the utility of simple hiPSC-induced cortical cell and tissue culture systems supplemented with hiMacs for elucidating critical aspects of AD pathology, such as microglial function and physiology. Adopting such systems in routine research practice may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for AD.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous psychophysical studies show that Bayesian inference governs sensory decision-making; however, the specific neural circuitry underlying this probabilistic mechanism remains unclear. We record extracellular neural activity along the somatosensory pathway of mice while delivering sensory stimulation paradigms designed to isolate the response to the surprise generated by Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that laminar cortical circuits in early sensory areas encode Bayesian surprise. Systematic sensitivity to surprise is not identified in the somatosensory thalamus, rather emerging in the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices. Multiunit spiking activity and evoked potentials in layer 6 of these regions exhibit the highest sensitivity to surprise. Gamma power in S1 layer 2/3 exhibits an NMDAR-dependent scaling with surprise, as does alpha power in layers 2/3 and 6 of S2. These results show a precise spatiotemporal neural representation of Bayesian surprise and suggest that Bayesian inference is a fundamental component of cortical processing.

Abstract: Summary
As a key component of the inflammasome, NLRP3 is a critical intracellular danger sensor emerging as an important clinical target in inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the mechanisms that determine the kinetics of NLRP3 inflammasome stability and activity to ensure effective and controllable inflammatory responses. Here, we show that S-palmitoylation acts as a brake to turn NLRP3 inflammasome off. zDHHC12 is identified as the S-acyltransferase for NLRP3 palmitoylation, which promotes its degradation through the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway. Zdhhc12 deficiency in mice enhances inflammatory symptoms and lethality following alum-induced peritonitis and LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Notably, several disease-associated mutations in NLRP3 are associated with defective palmitoylation, resulting in overt NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, our findings identify zDHHC12 as a repressor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and uncover a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which the inflammasome pathway is tightly controlled by the dynamic palmitoylation of NLRP3.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptotic cell (AC) clearance (efferocytosis) is performed by phagocytes, such as macrophages, that inhabit harsh physiological environments. Here, we find that macrophages display enhanced efferocytosis under prolonged (chronic) physiological hypoxia, characterized by increased internalization and accelerated degradation of ACs. Transcriptional and translational analyses revealed that chronic physiological hypoxia induces two distinct but complimentary states. The first, “primed” state, consists of concomitant transcription and translation of metabolic programs in AC-naive macrophages that persist during efferocytosis. The second, “poised” state, consists of transcription, but not translation, of phagocyte function programs in AC-naive macrophages that are translated during efferocytosis. Mechanistically, macrophages efficiently flux glucose into a noncanonical pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) loop to enhance NADPH production. PPP-derived NADPH directly supports enhanced efferocytosis under physiological hypoxia by ensuring phagolysosomal maturation and redox homeostasis. Thus, macrophages residing under physiological hypoxia adopt states that support cell fitness and ensure performance of essential homeostatic functions rapidly and safely.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex has recently been shown as capable of operating bidirectionally. Here, we develop a method (Q-Flux) capable of measuring absolute rates of both forward (VSDH(F)) and reverse (VSDH(R)) flux through SDH in vivo while also deconvoluting the amount of glucose derived from four discreet carbon sources in the liver. In validation studies, a mitochondrial uncoupler increased net SDH flux by >100% in awake rodents but also increased SDH cycling. During hyperglucagonemia, attenuated pyruvate cycling enhances phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase efficiency to drive increased gluconeogenesis, which is complemented by increased glutaminase (GLS) flux, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) flux, and glycerol conversion to glucose. During hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, both pyruvate carboxylase and GLS are suppressed, while VSDH(R) is increased. Unstimulated MUT is a minor anaplerotic reaction but is readily induced by small amounts of propionate, which elicits glucagon-like metabolic rewiring. Taken together, Q-Flux yields a comprehensive picture of hepatic mitochondrial metabolism and should be broadly useful to researchers.

Abstract: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious central nervous system complication characterized by impaired memory, reduced information processing ability, and anxiety. Recently, the role of FGF19 in neurological diseases has been reported. However, the effect and mechanisms of FGF19 in improving symptoms of POCD remain unknown. This study aimed to identify the role and exploring the underlying mechanisms of FGF19 in POCD. Here, rats were separated into four different groups, including control, sevoflurane (sev), sev + AAV-empty, and sev + AAV-FGF19 group. Then, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was applied to identify the effect of FGF19 on POCD rats. The result proved that FGF19 improved sevoflurane induced cognitive dysfunction in rats. Subsequently, the expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10 were detected to verify the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of FGF19 in POCD rats. Furthermore, DHE fluorescent staining assay showed that FGF19 could inhibit sevoflurane-induced oxidative stress in POCD rats. Besides, NISSL staining and TUNEL assay were applied to reveal that FGF19 could alleviate hippocampal neuron injury induced by sevoflurane in rats. Moreover, mechanistic studies confirmed that FGF19 improved symptoms of POCD by mediated PGC-1α/BDNF/FNDC5 pathway. Together, these results suggested that FGF19 improves sevoflurane-induced POCD in rats through the PGC-1α/BDNF/FNDC5 pathway.

Abstract: Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (II/R) injury is a common clinical and pathological change; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that the inflammatory response induced by mast cell degranulation may be involved in the mechanism underlying II/R injury in rats. In this study, we established a human intestinal epithelial adenocarcinoma cell (Caco-2) hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model and transwell system to investigate the effects of culture media (CM) from hypoxia conditioned human mast cell (HMC-1) and HMC-1 H/R on hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in Caco-2 under H/R conditions. Moreover, we assessed the barrier function of Caco-2 by measuring the 4-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (FD4) flux and the tight junction protein expression. The results concluded that Caco-2 exposed to H/R insult showed an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, cell apoptosis index, cell permeability, Bax expression, phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38, and a decrease in cell viability and expression of Bcl-2, ZO1, and occludin (all P < 0.05). Notably, preincubating Caco-2 with HMC-1CM resulted in an increase in cell injury (increased LDH levels and cell permeability, decreased cell viability), apoptosis index, p-JNK, and p-38 expression and a decrease in ZO1 and occludin expression by co-culture system (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, our results show that HMC-1 hypoxic and reoxygenated CM aggravates hypoxic and reoxygenated injury in Caco-2 by increasing the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Most relapsed/refractory large B cell lymphoma (r/rLBCL) patients receiving anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19) T cells relapse. To characterize determinants of resistance, we profiled over 700 longitudinal specimens from two independent cohorts (n = 65 and n = 73) of r/rLBCL patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. A method for simultaneous profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), cell-free CAR19 (cfCAR19) retroviral fragments, and cell-free T cell receptor rearrangements (cfTCR) enabled integration of tumor and both engineered and non-engineered T cell effector-mediated factors for assessing treatment failure and predicting outcomes. Alterations in multiple classes of genes are associated with resistance, including B cell identity (PAX5 and IRF8), immune checkpoints (CD274), and those affecting the microenvironment (TMEM30A). Somatic tumor alterations affect CAR19 therapy at multiple levels, including CAR19 T cell expansion, persistence, and tumor microenvironment. Further, CAR19 T cells play a reciprocal role in shaping tumor genotype and phenotype. We envision these findings will facilitate improved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and personalized therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Protein structure, function, and evolution depend on local and collective epistatic interactions between amino acids. A powerful approach to defining these interactions is to construct models of couplings between amino acids that reproduce the empirical statistics (frequencies and correlations) observed in sequences comprising a protein family. The top couplings are then interpreted. Here, we show that as currently implemented, this inference unequally represents epistatic interactions, a problem that fundamentally arises from limited sampling of sequences in the context of distinct scales at which epistasis occurs in proteins. We show that these issues explain the ability of current approaches to predict tertiary contacts between amino acids and the inability to obviously expose larger networks of functionally relevant, collectively evolving residues called sectors. This work provides a necessary foundation for more deeply understanding and improving evolution-based models of proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Therapy resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of cancer. Here, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 screens across a broad range of therapies used in acute myeloid leukemia to identify genomic determinants of drug response. Our screens uncover a selective dependency on RNA splicing factors whose loss preferentially enhances response to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Loss of the splicing factor RBM10 augments response to venetoclax in leukemia yet is completely dispensable for normal hematopoiesis. Combined RBM10 and BCL2 inhibition leads to mis-splicing and inactivation of the inhibitor of apoptosis XIAP and downregulation of BCL2A1, an anti-apoptotic protein implicated in venetoclax resistance. Inhibition of splicing kinase families CLKs (CDC-like kinases) and DYRKs (dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases) leads to aberrant splicing of key splicing and apoptotic factors that synergize with venetoclax, and overcomes resistance to BCL2 inhibition. Our findings underscore the importance of splicing in modulating response to therapies and provide a strategy to improve venetoclax-based treatments.

Abstract: Summary
The actin cytoskeleton is critical for cell migration, morphogenesis, endocytosis, organelle dynamics, and cytokinesis. To support diverse cellular processes, actin filaments form a variety of structures with specific architectures and dynamic properties. Key proteins specifying actin filaments are tropomyosins. Non-muscle cells express several functionally non-redundant tropomyosin isoforms, which differentially control the interactions of other proteins, including myosins and ADF/cofilin, with actin filaments. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. By determining the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of actin filaments decorated by two functionally distinct non-muscle tropomyosin isoforms, Tpm1.6 and Tpm3.2, we reveal that actin filament conformation remains unaffected upon binding. However, Tpm1.6 and Tpm3.2 follow different paths along the actin filament major groove, providing an explanation for their incapability to co-polymerize on actin filaments. We also elucidate the molecular basis underlying specific roles of Tpm1.6 and Tpm3.2 in myosin II activation and protecting actin filaments from ADF/cofilin-catalyzed severing.

Abstract: Summary
The TFE3 and MITF master transcription factors maintain metabolic homeostasis by regulating lysosomal, melanocytic, and autophagy genes. Previous studies posited that their cytosolic retention by 14-3-3, mediated by the Rag GTPases-mTORC1, was key for suppressing transcriptional activity in the presence of nutrients. Here, we demonstrate using mammalian cells that regulated protein stability plays a fundamental role in their control. Amino acids promote the recruitment of TFE3 and MITF to the lysosomal surface via the Rag GTPases, activating an evolutionarily conserved phospho-degron and leading to ubiquitination by CUL1β−TrCP and degradation. Elucidation of the minimal functional degron revealed a conserved alpha-helix required for interaction with RagA, illuminating the molecular basis for a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by missense mutations in TFE3 within the RagA-TFE3 interface. Additionally, the phospho-degron is recurrently lost in TFE3 genomic translocations that cause kidney cancer. Therefore, two divergent pathologies converge on the loss of protein stability regulation by nutrients.

Abstract: Summary
While cytoplasmic tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS1) ligates tryptophan (Trp) to its cognate tRNAs for protein synthesis, it also plays a role as an innate immune activator in extracellular space. However, its secretion mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that in response to stimuli, WARS1 can be secreted via two distinct pathways: via Trp-dependent secretion of naked protein and via Trp-independent plasma-membrane-derived vesicles (PMVs). In the direct pathway, Trp binding to WARS1 induces a “closed” conformation, generating a hydrophobic surface and basic pocket. The Trp-bound WARS1 then binds stable phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate and inner plasma membrane leaflet, passing across the membrane. In the PMV-mediated secretion, WARS1 recruits calpain 2, which is activated by calcium. WARS1 released from PMVs induces inflammatory responses in vivo. These results provide insights into the secretion mechanisms of WARS1 and improve our understanding of how WARS1 is involved in the control of local and systemic inflammation upon infection.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium sporozoites are the motile forms of the malaria parasites that infect hepatocytes. The initial invasion of hepatocytes is thought to be actively driven by sporozoites, but host cell processes might also play a role. Sporozoite invasion triggers a host plasma membrane invagination that forms a vacuole around the intracellular parasite, which is critical for subsequent intracellular parasite replication. Using fast live confocal microscopy, we observed that the initial interactions between sporozoites and hepatocytes induce plasma membrane ruffles and filopodia extensions. Importantly, we find that these host cell processes facilitate invasion and that Rho GTPase signaling, which regulates membrane ruffling and filopodia extension, is critical for productive infection. Interestingly, sporozoite cell traversal stimulates these processes, suggesting that it increases hepatocyte susceptibility to productive infection. Our study identifies host cell signaling events involved in plasma membrane dynamics as a critical host component of successful malaria parasite infection of hepatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
In the conventional model of transcriptional activation, transcription factors bind to response elements and recruit co-factors, including histone acetyltransferases. Contrary to this model, we show that the histone acetyltransferase KAT7 (HBO1/MYST2) is required genome wide for histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac). Examining neural stem cells, we find that KAT7 and H3K14ac are present not only at transcribed genes but also at inactive genes, intergenic regions, and in heterochromatin. KAT7 and H3K14ac were not required for the continued transcription of genes that were actively transcribed at the time of loss of KAT7 but indispensable for the activation of repressed genes. The absence of KAT7 abrogates neural stem cell plasticity, diverse differentiation pathways, and cerebral cortex development. Re-expression of KAT7 restored stem cell developmental potential. Overexpression of KAT7 enhanced neuron and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Our data suggest that KAT7 prepares chromatin for transcriptional activation and is a prerequisite for gene activation.

Abstract: Summary
Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been widely explored in precision medicine. However, few studies have thoroughly investigated their best practices in global populations across different diseases. We here utilized data from Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI) to explore methodological considerations and PRS performance in 9 different biobanks for 14 disease endpoints. Specifically, we constructed PRSs using pruning and thresholding (P + T) and PRS-continuous shrinkage (CS). For both methods, using a European-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panel resulted in comparable or higher prediction accuracy compared with several other non-European-based panels. PRS-CS overall outperformed the classic P + T method, especially for endpoints with higher SNP-based heritability. Notably, prediction accuracy is heterogeneous across endpoints, biobanks, and ancestries, especially for asthma, which has known variation in disease prevalence across populations. Overall, we provide lessons for PRS construction, evaluation, and interpretation using GBMI resources and highlight the importance of best practices for PRS in the biobank-scale genomics era.

Abstract: Summary
Hox genes encode transcription factors that specify segmental identities along the anteroposterior body axis. These genes are organized in clusters, where their order corresponds to their activity along the body axis, a feature known as collinearity. In Drosophila, the BX-C cluster contains the three most posterior Hox genes, where their collinear activation incorporates progressive changes in histone modifications, chromatin architecture, and use of boundary elements and cis-regulatory regions. To dissect functional hierarchies, we compare chromatin organization in cell lines and larvae, with a focus on the Abd-B gene. Our work establishes the importance of the Fab-7 boundary for insulation between 3D domains carrying different histone modifications. Interestingly, we detect a non-canonical inversion of collinear chromatin dynamics at Abd-B, with the domain of active histone modifications progressively decreasing in size. This dynamic chromatin organization differentially activates the alternative promoters of the Abd-B gene, thereby expanding the possibilities for fine-tuning of transcriptional output.

Abstract: Although papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has a generally decent prognosis, approximately 10% of patients experience recurrence, which is frequently associated with distant metastasis. Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2), a protein located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, is thought to be a possible cancer promoter. This study aimed to discover the involvement of SLP-2 in PTC motility and angiogenesis, and to initially explore its mechanism. According to the CCLE database, SLP-2 was universally increased in various cancers. Then SLP-2 expression in PTC cell lines was evaluated. Thereafter the influences of SLP-2 knockdown on cell migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis were assessed, respectively. The mediated roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MAPKs in the SLP-2 regulation were likewise determined. SLP-2 was discovered to be upregulated in PTC cells, and its knockdown could suppress cell migration, invasion, EMT, and angiogenesis. Declined SLP-2 expression also facilitated ROS generation and inhibited phosphorylation of MAPKs. Moreover, ERK agonist and ROS scavenger treatment partially reversed the impacts of SLP-2 knockdown on cells, indicating SLP-2 regulated generation of ROS and ERK pathway to promote PTC motility and angiogenesis. Generally, SLP-2 appears to be one of the major genes in the pathogenesis of PTC. Silencing its expression may have an impact on the onset and evolution of PTC. The fact that SLP-2 has a considerable influence on ROS levels implies that PTC can be treated by boosting ROS levels.

Abstract: Summary
sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (sn-1,2-DAG)-mediated activation of protein kinase Cε (PKCε) is a key pathway that is responsible for obesity-related lipid metabolism disorders, which induces hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. No small molecules have been previously reported to ameliorate these diseases through this pathway. Here, we screened and identified the phytochemical atractylenolide II (AT II) that reduces the hepatic sn-1,2-DAG levels, deactivates PKCε activity, and improves obesity-induced hyperlipidemia, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, using the ABPP strategy, the diacylglycerol kinase family member DGKQ was identified as a direct target of AT II. AT II may act on a novel drug-binding pocket in the CRD and PH domains of DGKQ to thereby allosterically regulate its kinase activity. Moreover, AT II also increases weight loss by activating DGKQ-AMPK-PGC1α-UCP-1 signaling in adipose tissue. These findings suggest that AT II is a promising lead compound to improve obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Abstract: Objective
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a globally aggressive malignant tumor. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of JUND in ESCC development via MAPRE2.
Methods
ESCC cells (KYSE-450 and ECA109) were transfected with small interfering RNA (si)-JUND, si-MAPRE2, si-JUND, or pcDNA3.1-MAPRE2. JUND and MAPRE2 expression in ESCC cells was detected with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot. Cell counting kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine assays were used to determine ESCC cell proliferation. Dual-luciferase reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess binding between JUND and MAPRE2. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were co-cultured with ESCC cell supernatants. Angiogenesis was assessed with an in vitro angiogenesis assay. Western blot was conducted to evaluate the expression of angiogenic proteins [vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), and angiopoietin-2 (ang2)].
Results
The levels of expression of JUND and MAPRE2 were high in ESCC cells. Mechanistically, JUND bound to MAPRE2 promoter and increased MAPRE2 transcription. Downregulation of JUND or MAPRE2 inhibited KYSE-450 and ECA109 cell proliferation and reduced the levels of expression of VEGFA, MMP-9, and ang2 and tube formation in HUVECs co-cultured with ESCC cell supernatants. MAPRE2 upregulation counteracted the inhibitory effects of JUND silencing on cell proliferative and angiogenic capabilities in ESCC.
Conclusions
JUND promoted MAPRE2 transcription, thereby facilitating cell proliferative and angiogenic abilities in ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is an important signaling phospholipid that is required for regulated exocytosis and some forms of endocytosis. The two processes share a topologically similar pore structure that connects the vesicle lumen with the outside. Widening of the fusion pore during exocytosis leads to cargo release, while its closure initiates kiss&run or cavicapture endocytosis. We show here, using live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of insulin granule exocytosis, that transient accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 at the release site recruits components of the endocytic fission machinery and stalls the late fusion pore expansion that is required for peptide release. The absence of clathrin differentiates this mechanism from clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Knockdown of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate-5-kinase-1c or optogenetic recruitment of 5-phosphatase reduces PI(4,5)P2 transients and accelerates fusion pore expansion, suggesting that acute PI(4,5)P2 synthesis is involved. Thus, local phospholipid signaling inhibits fusion pore expansion and peptide release through an unconventional endocytic mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar-thalamo-striatal synaptic communication has been implicated in a wide range of behaviors, including goal-directed actions, and is altered in cerebellar dystonia. However, its detailed connectivity through the thalamus and its contribution to the execution of forelimb movements is unclear. Here, we use trans-synaptic and retrograde tracing, ex vivo slice recordings, and optogenetic inhibitions during the execution of unidirectional or sequential joystick displacements to demonstrate that the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) influence the dorsal striatum with a very high probability. We show that this mainly occurs through the centrolateral (CL), parafascicular (PF), and ventrolateral (VL) nuclei of the thalamus, observing that the DCN→VL and DCN→CL pathways contribute to the execution of unidirectional forelimb displacements while the DCN→PF and DCN→thalamo→striatal pathways contribute to the appropriate execution of forelimb reaching and sequential displacements. These findings highlight specific contributions of the different cerebellar-thalamo-striatal paths to the control of skilled forelimb movement.

Abstract: Summary
Akt is commonly activated and serves as a valuable target in human cancer. In this study, OTUD1 is identified as an Akt-associated protein and is downregulated upon Akt activation. Ectopic OTUD1 inhibits Akt phosphorylation; however, its deubiquitinase activity contributes only slightly to this effect. A short peptide (OUN-36) located in the OTUD1 N-terminal intrinsically disordered region strongly binds to the Akt PH domain. The residues in the PH domain, which are required for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 recognition, are also essential for OUN-36 binding. OUN-36 preferentially inhibits Akt-hyperactive tumor cells’ proliferation and interferes with Akt cell membrane localization, presumably by disrupting PH domain-PIP3 interaction. Importantly, OUN-36-based therapy efficiently abrogates Akt feedback reactivation in response to MK-2206 treatment and sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. We therefore show a mechanism by which OTUD1 modulates Akt activity and suggest a potential peptide-based cancer therapeutic strategy implemented by targeting the Akt PH domain.

Abstract: Summary
Preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is a standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients, yet little is known about the mediators underlying the heterogeneous patient response. In this longitudinal study, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing on 353 fecal specimens and find reduced microbial diversity after nCRT. Multi-omics data integration reveals that Bacteroides vulgatus-mediated nucleotide biosynthesis associates with nCRT resistance in LARC patients, and nonresponsive tumors are characterized by the upregulation of genes related to DNA repair and nucleoside transport. Nucleosides supplementation or B. vulgatus gavage protects cancer cells from the 5-fluorouracil or irradiation treatment. An analysis of 2,205 serum samples from 735 patients suggests that uric acid is a potential prognosis marker for LARC patients receiving nCRT. Our data unravel the role of intestinal microbiota-mediated nucleotide biosynthesis in the response of rectal tumors to nCRT, and highlight the importance of deciphering the cross-talk between cancer cells and gut microorganisms during cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) regulates the differentiation and function of CD4+ T cells; however, its cell-intrinsic role in CD8+ T cells remains elusive. Herein we show that Ahr acts as a promoter of resident memory CD8+ T cell (TRM) differentiation and function. Genetic ablation of Ahr in mouse CD8+ T cells leads to increased CD127–KLRG1+ short-lived effector cells and CD44+CD62L+ T central memory cells but reduced granzyme-B-producing CD69+CD103+ TRM cells. Genome-wide analyses reveal that Ahr suppresses the circulating while promoting the resident memory core gene program. A tumor resident polyfunctional CD8+ T cell population, revealed by single-cell RNA-seq, is diminished upon Ahr deletion, compromising anti-tumor immunity. Human intestinal intraepithelial CD8+ T cells also highly express AHR that regulates in vitro TRM differentiation and granzyme B production. Collectively, these data suggest that Ahr is an important cell-intrinsic factor for CD8+ T cell immunity.

Abstract: Objective
To explore whether nuclear factor I C (NFIC) alleviated inflammatory response of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) caused by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by regulating transcription levels of phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and sentrin-specific protease 8 (SENP8).
Methods
NFIC, PTEN, and SENP8 levels in RASFs and normal SFs (NSFs) were measured by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The levels of Bax, Bcl-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13, as well as the content of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined in RASFs and NSFs using western blotting and ELISA. The binding of NFIC to promoter sequences of PTEN and SENP8 was predicted and verified. A mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was established and evaluated according to the degree of joint swelling and arthritis index.
Results
NFIC, PTEN, and SENP8 were downregulated in RASFs. RASFs had increased viability and MDA levels as well as decreased cell apoptosis and SOD content. NFIC was demonstrated to modulate the transcription of PTEN and SENP8 as their transcription factor. NFIC ameliorated the inflammatory response induced by RA in vivo by promoting the transcription of PTEN and SENP8.
Conclusion
NFIC acted as a transcription factor to facilitate the transcription of PTEN and SENP8, thereby inducing apoptosis of RASFs and effectively attenuating inflammatory response in CIA mice.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic models suggested that SMARCA5 was required for DNA-templated events including transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. We engineered a degron tag into the endogenous alleles of SMARCA5, a catalytic component of the imitation switch complexes in three different human cell lines to define the effects of rapid degradation of this key regulator. Degradation of SMARCA5 was associated with a rapid increase in global nucleosome repeat length, which may allow greater chromatin compaction. However, there were few changes in nascent transcription within the first 6 h of degradation. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a requirement for SMARCA5 to control nucleosome repeat length at G1/S and during the S phase. SMARCA5 co-localized with CTCF and H2A.Z, and we found a rapid loss of CTCF DNA binding and disruption of nucleosomal phasing around CTCF binding sites. This spatiotemporal analysis indicates that SMARCA5 is continuously required for maintaining nucleosomal spacing.

Abstract: Summary
The versatility of ubiquitination to control vast domains of eukaryotic biology is due, in part, to diversification through differently linked poly-ubiquitin chains. Deciphering signaling roles for some chain types, including those linked via K6, has been stymied by a lack of specificity among the implicated regulatory proteins. Forged through strong evolutionary pressures, pathogenic bacteria have evolved intricate mechanisms to regulate host ubiquitin during infection. Herein, we identify and characterize a deubiquitinase domain of the secreted effector LotA from Legionella pneumophila that specifically regulates K6-linked poly-ubiquitin. We demonstrate the utility of LotA for studying K6 poly-ubiquitin signals. We identify the structural basis of LotA activation and poly-ubiquitin specificity and describe an essential “adaptive” ubiquitin-binding domain. Without LotA activity during infection, the Legionella-containing vacuole becomes decorated with K6 poly-ubiquitin as well as the AAA ATPase VCP/p97/Cdc48. We propose that LotA’s deubiquitinase activity guards Legionella-containing vacuole components from ubiquitin-dependent extraction.

Abstract: Objective
This experiment was designed to demonstrate Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from kidney can alleviate cisplatin-induced kidney injury and renal cell apoptosis through paracrine pathway.
Methods
Firstly, MSCs were isolated from kidney of young rats, and their surface-specific markers were identified by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining. Self-renewal ability of Kidney Mesenchymal Stem Cells (KMSCs) was observed by cell counting and 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) fluorescence staining. KMSCs at logarithmic growth stage were traced and injected into rat through tail vein.
Results
The results showed that KMSCs homed in the kidney tissues, decreased the secretion of inflammatory factors (CRP, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6), and alleviated renal function. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H＆E), Masson and Periodic Acid-silver Methenamine (PASM) staining showed that KMSCs could alleviate pathological damage in rats. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that KMSCs could reduce the apoptosis of rat kidney cells induced by cisplatin. Finally, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results showed that cisplatin could induce higher expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and lower expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in kidney tissues. However, KMSCs could reverse the pro-apoptotic effect of cisplatin on kidney cells and improve the survival rate of rats.
Conclusions
In conclusion, KMSCs were successfully isolated from kidney tissues, and KMSCs have therapeutic effects on rat kidney injury induced by cisplatin.

Abstract: Summary
The speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) functions in the Cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) as a receptor for the recognition of substrates involved in cell growth, survival, and signaling. SPOP mutations have been attributed to the development of many types of cancers, including prostate and endometrial cancers. Prostate cancer mutations localize in the substrate-binding site of the substrate recognition (MATH) domain and reduce or prevent binding. However, most endometrial cancer mutations are dispersed in seemingly inconspicuous solvent-exposed regions of SPOP, offering no clear basis for their cancer-causing and peculiar gain-of-function properties. Herein, we present the first structure of SPOP in its oligomeric form, uncovering several new interfaces important for SPOP self-assembly and normal function. Given that many previously unaccounted-for cancer mutations are localized in these newly identified interfaces, we uncover molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulation of SPOP function, with effects ranging from gross structural changes to enhanced self-association, and heightened stability and activity.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) resulting in expression of mutant HTT proteins (mHTT) with extended polyglutamine tracts, including in striatal neurons and astrocytes. It is unknown whether pathophysiology in vivo can be attenuated by lowering mHTT in either cell type throughout the brain, and the relative contributions of neurons and astrocytes to HD remain undefined. We use zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcriptional repressors to cell-selectively lower mHTT in vivo. Astrocytes display loss of essential functions such as cholesterol metabolism that are partly driven by greater neuronal dysfunctions, which encompass neuromodulation, synaptic, and intracellular signaling pathways. Using transcriptomics, proteomics, electrophysiology, and behavior, we dissect neuronal and astrocytic contributions to HD pathophysiology. Remarkably, brain-wide delivery of neuronal ZFPs results in strong mHTT lowering, rescue of HD-associated behavioral and molecular phenotypes, and significant extension of lifespan, findings that support translational development.

Abstract: Summary
Effective therapies are lacking for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). The CRC tumor microenvironment has elevated metabolic waste products due to altered metabolism and proximity to the microbiota. The role of metabolite waste in tumor development, progression, and treatment resistance is unclear. We generated an autochthonous metastatic mouse model of CRC and used unbiased multi-omic analyses to reveal a robust accumulation of tumoral ammonia. The high ammonia levels induce T cell metabolic reprogramming, increase exhaustion, and decrease proliferation. CRC patients have increased serum ammonia, and the ammonia-related gene signature correlates with altered T cell response, adverse patient outcomes, and lack of response to immune checkpoint blockade. We demonstrate that enhancing ammonia clearance reactivates T cells, decreases tumor growth, and extends survival. Moreover, decreasing tumor-associated ammonia enhances anti-PD-L1 efficacy. These findings indicate that enhancing ammonia detoxification can reactivate T cells, highlighting a new approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial responses to the cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) cause airway obstruction in asthma. Here we utilized multiple genomic techniques to identify IL-13-responsive regulatory elements in bronchial epithelial cells and used these data to develop a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-based therapeutic approach to downregulate airway obstruction-inducing genes in a cell type- and IL-13-specific manner. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and acetylated lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27ac) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we identified IL-13-responsive genes and regulatory elements. These sequences were functionally validated and optimized via massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) for IL-13-inducible activity. The top secretory cell-selective sequence from the MPRA, a novel, distal enhancer of the sterile alpha motif pointed domain containing E-26 transformation-specific transcription factor (SPDEF) gene, was utilized to drive CRISPRi and knock down SPDEF or mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), both involved in pathologic mucus production in asthma. Our work provides a catalog of cell type-specific genes and regulatory elements involved in IL-13 bronchial epithelial response and showcases their use for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: Summary
The adult spinal cord stem cell potential resides within the ependymal cell population and declines with age. Ependymal cells are, however, heterogeneous, and the biological diversity this represents and how it changes with age remain unknown. Here, we present a single-cell transcriptomic census of spinal cord ependymal cells from adult and aged mice, identifying not only all known ependymal cell subtypes but also immature as well as mature cell states. By comparing transcriptomes of spinal cord and brain ependymal cells, which lack stem cell abilities, we identify immature cells as potential spinal cord stem cells. Following spinal cord injury, these cells re-enter the cell cycle, which is accompanied by a short-lived reversal of ependymal cell maturation. We further analyze ependymal cells in the human spinal cord and identify widespread cell maturation and altered cell identities. This in-depth characterization of spinal cord ependymal cells provides insight into their biology and informs strategies for spinal cord repair.

Abstract: Objective
This study aims to explore the mechanism of miR-211–5p in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in improving frozen shoulder (FS) in rat models.
Methods
Rat BMSCs and EVs derived from rat BMSCs were isolated, identified, and then injected into rats to assess the expression of TGF-β, MMP1, MMP3, MMP12, GAP43, and PGP9.5 in shoulder capsule tissues. The range of motion of bilateral glenohumeral joints was assessed and pathological changes of shoulder capsule tissues were observed after hematoxylin-eosin staining. The binding sites of miR-211–5p to KDM2B and LACC1 to H3K4me3 were measured. FS rat models with LACC1 highly expressed were established to assess the motion of bilateral glenohumeral joints and expression of arthritis related factors in rats.
Results
EVs were successfully extracted from BMSCs. Injection of BMSCs-EVs could improve the activity of bilateral glenohumeral joints and the pathological condition of joint capsule in rats. Elevated expression of miR-211–5p was found in rats injected with BMSCs-EVs. Dual luciferase assay showed that miR-211–5p had a binding site with KDM2B. ChIP, qRT-PCR, and western blot experiments showed BMSCs-EVs injection resulted in elevated enrichment of LACC1 promoter in shoulder capsule tissues of FS rats, and decreased mRNA and protein expression of KDM2B and increased H3K4me3 methylation. Overexpression of LACC1 could also improve the pathological condition of joint capsule tissue.
Conclusion
miR-211–5p in EVs derived from BMSCs increased H3K4me3 methylation in shoulder capsule tissue of rats by binding KDM2B, resulting in up-regulated transcription level of LACC1 and improving FS.

Abstract: Summary
In many developing tissues, the patterns of gene expression that assign cell fate are organized by graded secreted signals. Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) interpret these signals to control gene expression, but how this is accomplished remains poorly understood. In the neural tube, a gradient of the morphogen sonic hedgehog (Shh) patterns neural progenitors. We identify two distinct ways in which CREs translate graded Shh into differential gene expression in mouse neural progenitors. In most progenitors, a common set of CREs control gene activity by integrating cell-type-specific inputs. By contrast, the most ventral progenitors use a unique set of CREs, established by the pioneer factor FOXA2. This parallels the role of FOXA2 in endoderm, where FOXA2 binds some of the same sites. Together, the data identify distinct cis-regulatory strategies for the interpretation of morphogen signaling and raise the possibility of an evolutionarily conserved role for FOXA2 across tissues.

Abstract: Summary
To date, there is a consensus that there are at least two neuronal populations in the non-human primate (NHP) external globus pallidus (GPe): low-frequency discharge (LFD) and high-frequency discharge (HFD) neurons. Nevertheless, almost all NHP physiological studies have neglected the functional importance of LFD neurons. This study examined the discharge features of these two GPe neuronal subpopulations recorded in four NHPs engaged in a classical conditioning task with cues predicting reward, neutral and aversive outcomes. The results show that LFD neurons tended to burst, encoded the salience of behavioral cues, and exhibited correlated spiking activity. By contrast, the HFD neurons tended to pause, encoded cue valence, and exhibited uncorrelated spiking activity. Overall, these findings point to the dichotomic organization of the NHP GPe, which is likely to be critical to the implementation of normal basal ganglia functions and computations.

Abstract: Summary
Activating the macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome can promote excessive inflammation with severe cell and tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Here, we show that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) significantly attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine and human macrophages and septic mice by lowering caspase-1 cleavage and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion. Inhibiting PDHK reverses NLRP3 inflammasome-induced metabolic reprogramming, enhances autophagy, promotes mitochondrial fusion over fission, preserves crista ultrastructure, and attenuates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The suppressive effect of PDHK inhibition on the NLRP3 inflammasome is independent of its canonical role as a pyruvate dehydrogenase regulator. Our study suggests a non-canonical role of mitochondrial PDHK in promoting mitochondrial stress and supporting NLRP3 inflammasome activation during acute inflammation.

Abstract: We previously reported that knocking down GPD2 (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2), responsible for the glycerol-phosphate shuttle, causes human hepatocarcinoma-derived HuH-7 cells, lowering the cancer stemness. After examining whether GPD2 expression in the other cell lines could affect their cancer stemness, this study showed that human neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells also lower the ability of sphere formation by knocking down GPD2. This suggests that GPD2 relates to the common mechanism for maintaining cancer stem cells, as in the cases like SH-SY5Y and HuH-7 cells. In addition, knocking down GPD2 in SH-SY5Y cells showed a morphological change and increasing tendency of neuronal marker genes, including GAP43, NeuN, and TUBB3, indicating that GPD2 may contribute to not only cancer but also neural stem cell maintenance. After all, GPD2 may play a role in maintaining cancer and neural stemness, although further rigorous studies are essential to conclude this. It is expected that GPD2 will be a novel target gene for cancer therapy, stem cell research, and development.

Abstract: Summary
The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) provides multisensory information to the hippocampus, directly to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. LEC neurons perform important functions for episodic memory processing, coding for contextually salient elements of an environment or experience. However, we know little about the functional circuit interactions between the LEC and the hippocampus. We combine functional circuit mapping and computational modeling to examine how long-range glutamatergic LEC projections modulate compartment-specific excitation-inhibition dynamics in hippocampal area CA1. We demonstrate that glutamatergic LEC inputs can drive local dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons, aided by the recruitment of a disinhibitory VIP interneuron microcircuit. Our circuit mapping and modeling further reveal that LEC inputs also recruit CCK interneurons that may act as strong suppressors of dendritic spikes. These results highlight a cortically driven GABAergic microcircuit mechanism that gates nonlinear dendritic computations, which may support compartment-specific coding of multisensory contextual features within the hippocampus.

Abstract: Summary
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) represents a major subtype of lung cancer with limited treatment options. KMT2D is one of the most frequently mutated genes in LUSC (>20%), and yet its role in LUSC oncogenesis remains unknown. Here, we identify KMT2D as a key regulator of LUSC tumorigenesis wherein Kmt2d deletion transforms lung basal cell organoids to LUSC. Kmt2d loss increases activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), EGFR and ERBB2, partly through reprogramming the chromatin landscape to repress the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatases. These events provoke a robust elevation in the oncogenic RTK-RAS signaling. Combining SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 and pan-ERBB inhibitor afatinib inhibits lung tumor growth in Kmt2d-deficient LUSC murine models and in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) harboring KMT2D mutations. Our study identifies KMT2D as a pivotal epigenetic modulator for LUSC oncogenesis and suggests that KMT2D loss renders LUSC therapeutically vulnerable to RTK-RAS inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have caused successive global waves of infection. These variants, with multiple mutations in the spike protein, are thought to facilitate escape from natural and vaccine-induced immunity and often increase in affinity for ACE2. The latest variant to cause concern is BA.2.75, identified in India where it is now the dominant strain, with evidence of wider dissemination. BA.2.75 is derived from BA.2 and contains four additional mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we perform an antigenic and biophysical characterization of BA.2.75, revealing an interesting balance between humoral evasion and ACE2 receptor affinity. ACE2 affinity for BA.2.75 is increased 9-fold compared with BA.2; there is also evidence of escape of BA.2.75 from immune serum, particularly that induced by Delta infection, which may explain the rapid spread in India, where where there is a high background of Delta infection. ACE2 affinity appears to be prioritized over greater escape.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense mutations, accounting for >20% of disease-associated mutations, lead to premature translation termination. Replacing uridine with pseudouridine in stop codons suppresses translation termination, which could be harnessed to mediate readthrough of premature termination codons (PTCs). Here, we present RESTART, a programmable RNA base editor, to revert PTC-induced translation termination in mammalian cells. RESTART utilizes an engineered guide snoRNA (gsnoRNA) and the endogenous H/ACA box snoRNP machinery to achieve precise pseudouridylation. We also identified and optimized gsnoRNA scaffolds to increase the editing efficiency. Unexpectedly, we found that a minor isoform of pseudouridine synthase DKC1, lacking a C-terminal nuclear localization signal, greatly improved the PTC-readthrough efficiency. Although RESTART induced restricted off-target pseudouridylation, they did not change the coding information nor the expression level of off-targets. Finally, RESTART enables robust pseudouridylation in primary cells and achieves functional PTC readthrough in disease-relevant contexts. Collectively, RESTART is a promising RNA-editing tool for research and therapeutics.

Abstract: The dissemination of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii threatens global healthcare systems and necessitates the development of novel therapeutic options. The Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope provides a first defensive barrier against antimicrobial assault. Essential components of this multi-layered complex are the phospholipid-rich membranes. Phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) phosphatases are responsible for a key step in the biosynthesis of a major phospholipid species, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), but these enzymes have also been implicated in the biogenesis of other cell envelope components. Our bioinformatics analyses identified two putative PGP candidates in the A. baumannii genome, PgpA and PgpB. Phospholipid analyses of isogenic pgpA mutants in two distinct A. baumannii strains revealed a shift in the desaturation levels of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) phospholipid species, possibly due to the activation of the phospholipid desaturase DesA. We also investigated the impact of the inner membrane phosphatases on other cell envelope components, which revealed a role of PgpB in the maintenance of the A. baumannii peptidoglycan layer, and consequently carbapenem resistance. Collectively, this work provides novel insights into the roles of PGP phosphatases on the global lipidomic landscape of A. baumannii and their interconnectivity with the biogenesis of other cell envelope components. The non-essentiality of these candidates exemplifies metabolic versatility of A. baumannii, which is believed to be key to its success as global pathogen.
