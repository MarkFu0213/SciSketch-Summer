Abstract: In this work, the dependence of the enhancement in the efficiency of polymer solar cells incorporated with gold nanorods embedded in the photoactive layer on the photoactive layer thickness has been studied in detail. Synthesized toluene-based gold nanorods were introduced to devices by simply blending them with a solution of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester. The photovoltaic parameters for devices made with two different thicknesses, 100 and 40nm, of polymer:fullerene:nanorods films revealed that while the power conversion efficiency of the thin devices was enhanced by 27% due to the plasmonic effect induced by the presence of the gold nanorods in the film, its value was lowered in devices made with the thicker films. Comparison between thick/thin photoactive films' absorbance, morphologies and shunt resistances related such reduction in the performance to the high leakage current that resulted from quenching energy states in the photoactive film.

Abstract: A functioning vascular supply is essential for solid tumor growth and metastases, which means that blood vessels are an ideal target for antitumor drug discovery. Targeting tumor vasculature involves two main approaches, anti-angiogenesis and vascular disruption. The anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting activities of deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT), a natural microtubule destabilizer, were examined with several in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo models. First, we demonstrated that DPT significantly inhibits the proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells and inhibits angiogenesis in rat aortic ring and chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. In further studies, DPT induced cytoskeleton reorganization in endothelial cells, which likely contributed to the anti-angiogenic effect at non-cytotoxic concentrations. DPT treatment at higher concentrations for longer time induced the cell cycle arrest, which may contributes to its anti-proliferation effect and anti-angiogenic activity. And DPT dramatically inducted the expression of cyclin B1 and p21 (WAF1/CIP1). Meanwhile, DPT disrupted capillary-like networks in vitro and newly formed vessels from rat aortic rings. Endothelial cell contraction associated with an increase in F-actin via the Rho/Rho kinase pathway likely contributed to the vascular disrupting activity. Taken together, our results provided the initial evidence that DPT exerts potent anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting effects. This study also provides important insight into the mechanism of action of promising new anticancer drugs with both anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting activities.

Abstract: The performance of hybrid solar cells composed of polymer and ZnO is mainly hindered by the defects of ZnO. Here, we investigate the effects of ZnO nanoparticle surface modification with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) on the performance of bulk heterojunction hybrid solar cells based on poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) and ZnO nanoparticles. The reference device using ZnO nanoparticles as electron acceptor shows an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.83V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 3.00mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.46 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.15%. After modification with very small amount of PEO, the PCE will be enhanced, which is attributed to less surface traps of ZnO nanoparticles with PEO modification. With optimized PEO (0.05%) modified ZnO nanoparticles as electron acceptors, the device typically shows a VOC of 0.86V, a JSC of 3.84mA/cm2, a FF of 0.51 and a PCE of 1.68% due to less recombination loss of carriers, smaller series resistance, and improved electrical coupling between ZnO nanoparticle and MEH-PPV. However, further increase of PEO content to 0.3% will deteriorate device performance.

Abstract: A complete experimental study of temperature dependence of the total spectral emissivity has been performed, for the first time, for absorber–reflector selective coatings used in concentrated solar power (CSP) systems for energy harvesting. The coating consist of double cermet layers of silicon oxide with different amounts of molybdenum over a silver infrared mirror layer. The experimental measurements were carried out by a high accurate radiometer (HAIRL) with controlled atmosphere in the mid-infrared and for temperatures between 150 and 600°C. The spectral emissivity is nearly constant in this temperature range. Therefore, the temperature dependence of the total emissivity is given by Planck function. These results were compared with those obtained with the usual calculus using room temperature reflectance spectrum. Finally, the performance of the coating was analyzed by comparison of coated respect to non-coated stainless steel.

Abstract: The electro-optical properties of Poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) thin films have been studied while the sample is illuminated with blue light. By combining Kelvin probe microscopy with classical optical techniques it has been possible to monitor the evolution of the nanoscale contact potential, the surface photovoltage and the optical properties of the material establishing a correlation between them. Contrary to what is usually accepted, it has been found that the nanoscale surface photovoltage is larger when the polymer is already photobleached. In addition, it has been possible to distinguish between the photophysical processes that govern the working principle of a polymer-based device and the photochemical reactions that degrade the material. Although complex charges trapping phenomena take place during the irradiation, the surface photovoltage effect depends only on the number of photons that have reached the polymer.

Abstract: GaSb/InGaAs quantum dot–well (QDW) hybrid active regions with type-II band alignment are explored for increasing the infrared absorption in GaAs solar cells. Analyzed GaAs p–i–n structures comprise five layers of either GaSb quantum dot (QD), InGaAs quantum well (QW) or GaSb/InGaAs QDW layers in the i-region. It is found that the QDW solar cells outperform the QW and QD solar cells beyond GaAs band edge. In QDW solar cells an increase in efficiency is observed over QD solar cells due to additional QW absorption. An analysis of bulk response degradation in QDW solar cell is also presented. Improved photoresponse in QDW solar cells over QW and QD solar cells proves the potential for QDW hybrid structures in achieving high efficiency intermediate band solar cells.

Abstract: The authors have successfully developed “W-textured” ZnO:B-coated soda-lime glass substrates with higher haze value and lower reflectance and thus, improved light-trapping effect, especially, in the long wavelength region. In order to obtain higher efficiency the authors have applied here this technique to a white glass substrate which has higher transmittance. The authors have investigated the relationship between its refractive index on each side of the glass before RIE etching and the RMS roughness of ZnO:B layer coated by the MOCVD method (on either side of the glass) after etching. For the surface morphology of the ZnO:B layer deposited on the side of the RIE-etched white glass with lower refractive index, it was found, in this study, that it shows mountain-chain-like double texture with higher haze value. Whereas ZnO:B layers deposited on soda-lime glass (SLG) investigated in a previous study, have cauliflower-like morphology and lower haze values. By using the newly developed white glass substrates, a higher short-circuit current density Jsc could be obtained corresponding to an improved spectral response, especially in the long wavelength regions (>500nm). As a result, the a-Si:H/µc-Si:H solar cell fabricated on this newly developed substrate has an initial efficiency of 13.2% which is higher than the one for substrates based on soda-lime glass. This shows that this newly developed W-textured substrate is a promising solution for the deposition of high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells.

Abstract: P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and β1 integrin play essential roles in T cell trafficking during inflammation. E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 are their ligands expressed on inflammation-activated endothelium. During the tethering and rolling of lymphocytes on endothelium, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 binds E-selectin and induces signals. Subsequently, β1 integrin is activated and mediates stable adhesion. However, the intracellular signal pathways from PSGL-1 to β1 integrin have not yet been fully understood. Here, we find that p85, a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, forms a novel complex with Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2, a lymphocyte-specific RhoGTPases dissociation inhibitor. Phosporylations of the p85-bound Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 on 130 and 153 tyrosine residues by c-Abl and Src were required for the complex to be recruited to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and thereby regulate β1 integrin-mediated T cell adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Both shRNAs to Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 and p85 and over-expression of Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 Y130F and Y153F significantly reduced the above-mentioned adhesion. Although Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 in the p85-Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 complex was also phosphorylated on 24 tyrosine residue by Syk, the phosphorylation is not required for the adhesion. Taken together, we find that specific phosphorylations on 130 and 153 tyrosine residues of p85-bound Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 are pivotal for P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1-induced β1 integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. This will shed new light on the mechanisms that connect leukocyte initial rolling with subsequent adhesion.

Abstract: We have investigated the interaction between a random two-dimensional array of Ag islands near a Ag reflector, with the aim of producing a plasmonic back reflector structure with high diffuse reflectivity in the near-infrared, 600–1100nm wavelength, region. We have demonstrated the ability to tune the power scattered and absorbed by varying the distance between the plasmonic layer and the reflector. Finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate the tunability of the scattered and absorbed power with separation distance for a single Ag nanosphere near a planar Ag reflector. The tunability of the optical properties can be attributed to the modulation in the electric field driving the plasmonic resonance with separation distance. The simulation results indicate an intermediate distance where the scattered power peaks with minimal absorption losses. Random arrays of metal-islands were fabricated on varying thicknesses of a ZnO separation layer on a Ag reflector. Compared to a conventional textured Ag reflector, which has ∼2% diffuse reflectance in the near-infrared spectral region, the fabricated plasmonic reflector with ∼200nm sized Ag metal islands at 100nm separation distance from the Ag reflector shows a relatively higher, ∼24%, integrated diffuse reflectance in the near bandgap, 600–1100nm wavelength, region for thin film silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are an emerging class of nanomaterials with unique photonic and electric properties. In this study, GQDs were prepared by a facile, inexpensive and high-yield hydrothermal method and were further used as a cathode buffer additive for inverted polymer solar cells due to a wide band gap (~3.3eV) and well-matched energy level between GQDs–cesium carbonate (GQDs–Cs2CO3) modified indium tin oxide (3.8eV) and high occupied molecular orbit of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (3.7eV). In comparison to inverted polymer solar cells using cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) buffer layer, the power conversion efficiency of GQDs–Cs2CO3 based device showed 22% enhancement from 2.59% to 3.17% as a result of enhanced exciton dissociation and suppressed free charge recombination at cathode/polymer active layer interface by GQDs. This work provides a new application of GQDs in organic electronic devices.

Previous works have developed methods to extract the shunt resistances and the short circuit currents of individual cells, but their series resistances have not been characterized yet. In this paper, a novel methodology that quantifies the series resistances of individual cells is developed by using a partial shading technique with two different shading ratios. The simulation and experimental test results are presented for validation.

Abstract: We report an effective 2-step solvent treatment combined with a polar solvent vapor annealing process (PSVA) and a dipping process using polar solvents (DP) to enhance the electrical conductivity of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films, which is highly desirable for the fabrication of solution-processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs) on flexible substrates. The PSVA and DP-treated PEDOT:PSS films showed conductivities up to 1475S/cm. The changes in conductivity, surface morphology, composition, and conformational PEDOT chains are investigated to elucidate the effect of the 2-step PSVA and DP treatment on PEDOT:PSS films. The highly segregated-PSS component induced by PSVA was effectively removed from the PEDOT:PSS films after successive DP treatments, eventually resulting in an enhanced conductivity of bulk films. We also employed optimized PEDOT:PSS films treated by the 2-step PSVA and DP-process as transparent anodes for indium tin oxide (ITO)-free OPVs fabricated on flexible substrates. The device performance of flexible OPVs with PSVA and DP-treated films was further improved due to the increased conductivity and decreased series resistance of devices and showed highly comparable cell-efficiency with ITO-based flexible OPVs. These results suggest that the 2-step solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS film is a promising alternative to ITO for realization of high-efficiency, flexible, and low-cost ITO-free OPVs with facile manufacturing process.

Abstract: Vertebrate collagen types XV and XVIII are broadly distributed basement membrane components, classified into a structurally distinct subgroup called “multiplexin collagens”. Mutations in mammalian multiplexins are identified in some degenerative diseases such as Knobloch syndrome 1 (KNO1) or skeletal/cardiac myopathies, however, these progressive properties have not been elucidated. Here we investigated Drosophila mutants of Multiplexin (Mp), the only orthologue of vertebrate collagen types XV and XVIII, to understand the pathogenesis of multiplexin-related diseases. The mp mutants exhibited morphological changes in cardiomyocytes and progressive dysfunction of the skeletal muscles, reminiscent phenotypes observed in Col15a1-null mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed morphologically altered mitochondria in mutants’ indirect flight muscles (IFMs), resulting in severely attenuated ATP production and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, mutants’ IFMs exhibited diminished βPS integrin clustering and abolished focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, mutants’ defective IFMs are improved by the administrations of cyclosporin A, an inhibitor against mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening or losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker. Thus, our results suggest that Mp modulates mPTP opening and AT1R activity through its binding to integrin and that lack of Mp causes unregulated mPTP opening and AT1R activity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunctions. Hence, our results provide new insights towards the roles of multiplexin collagens in mitochondrial homeostasis and may serve as pharmacological evidences for the potential use of cyclosporin A or losartan for the therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) having different surface capping agent, variant electrical conductivity and sunlight absorption have been studied for the ternary hybrid containing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs). These NPs are composed of conducting gold, semiconducting CdS or PbS, or insulating cage-like molecular silica (POSS). We use a series of microscopic methods including TEM, AFM, SEM, optical, and fluorescence microscopy to estimate NP size and to probe the agglomeration and/or aggregation of NPs in P3HT/PCBM blends. Surface capping agent aromatic thiophenol (SPh) was found to be poor in the dispersion of NPs in P3HT/PCBM blends. The light harvesting of these NPs ranges from transparent (POSS NP), near transparent (CdS NP), visible light absorbing (Au NP), to near-infrared absorbing (PbS NP). Nevertheless, the absorbance of these NPs is all too small relative to that of P3HT polymer. Concerning the charge separation of P3HT exciton, the LUMO energy levels of these NPs have been determined by the combination of optical band-gap energy and HOMO energy levels. By the transient photocurrent time-of-flight method, charge carrier mobility of P3HT/PCBM/NP(CdS-SPh) ternary hybrid was found to be improved, although fluorescence quenching studies imply insufficient or ineffective contact between P3HT and all NPs in the present study. NPs hybrid P3HT/PCBM BHJ OPVs were fabricated by solution process. Regardless of conductivity or sunlight absorbance, all NPs show no improvement on power conversion efficiency of ternary hybrid OPVs, which is 3.03–3.91% less than 4.0–4.1% of P3HT/PCBM OPVs without NPs. Based on the present study, a few problems that associate with the inferior performance of NPs hybrid P3HT/PCBM BHJ OPVs are delineated.

Abstract: We investigated penetration-type semi-transparent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells that incorporated cuprite (Cu2O) thin films, deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering, as the color-adjusting layer. Depending on the arrangement of the Cu2O and transparent conductive oxide layers in the cells, the cells could be classified as either inner-type or outer-type. By simulating and experimentally measuring the reflectance of both types of cells, it was found that the optical interference in the two cells had a more significant effect on the short-circuit current density than did the thickness of the incorporated Cu2O films. We fabricated a-Si:H cells whose transparency and color could be controlled simultaneously. This technique of fabricating a-Si:H cells that exploit the phenomenon of interference can be used to realize cells that exhibit different colors.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of improving the performance of a quantum dot (QD) intermediate band solar cell (SC) by capping an InGaAs layer on the InAs QDs and inserting GaAs spacer layers. For comparison, a GaAs reference SC of the same p-i-n structure but without InAs QDs is grown. The two devices were grown by solid source molecular beam epitaxy (SS-MBE) on epiready (001) n+-GaAs substrates and the InAs QDs structure is highly stacked and well-aligned. The two SCs were investigated by sepectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), in the photon energy range of 1–6eV, photoluminescence (PL) and photo-absorption measurements. The two major spectral features observed in the dielectric function spectra of the InAs QDs SC at ∼3eV and ∼4.5eV are attributed to the E1 and E2 critical point structures of GaAs and InAs, respectively. The PL spectrum of the InAs QDs in the GaAs matrix is higher and presents an asymmetric shape, which indicated the growth of a high-quality multistacked InAs QDs structure and the contribution of larger and relatively smaller QDs to PL spectrum. The electrical conversion at the infrared range of λ=850–1300nm for the InAs QDs SC is demonstrated by photocurrent spectra. The enhanced absorption performance (up to 1280nm) of the QDs SC was attributed to the optical absorption from InAs QDs, wetting layer and InGaAs layer of the InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QD heterostructure.

Abstract: A novel sol–gel method was adopted to prepare polyethylene glycol/silicon dioxide shape-stabilized phase change materials (PEG/SiO2 ss-PCMs) with various PEG mass fractions. The gelatinization was carried out by adjusting temperature instead of adding coagulant. In PEG/SiO2 composites, PEG acted as the phase change material and silica gel served as the supporting material to keep the stable shape of the composites during the phase transition. Various characterization techniques were employed to investigate the structures and properties of the composites. Results showed that the composites exhibited the stable core–shell structures by impregnating PEG into multi-mesoporous silica gel; they could remain in the solid form even if the temperature exceeded the melting point of PEG. It was physical adsorption between PEG and silica gel, and the crystal structure of PEG component was unaffected, so that PEG in the composites retained an excellent phase change performance. The enthalpies of the composites varied from 63.4J/g to 128.4J/g (PEG mass fractions: 50–80%), which was proportional to PEG content. The thermal conductivities were increased to 0.558Wm−1K−1 by addition of graphite in mass fraction of 2.7%. Moreover, the composites presented excellent thermal stabilities and possessed a broad applicable temperature range, and they were suitable for thermal energy storage applications in building envelopes.

Abstract: The semi-conducting properties of polypyrrol (PPy) are investigated by the photo-electrochemical technique. The polymer is stable up to~190°C, above which a weight loss accounting for~60% is observed. An optical transition of 1.02eV is determined, directly allowed. Further indirect transition is determined at 0.37eV. The electrical conduction is characteristic of degenerate behavior with an activationless hopping and a hole mobility of 4.2×10−3cm2V−1s−1. The p-type conductivity is evidenced from the Mott–Schottky plots. In neutral solution, a flat band potential of 0.108VSCE and a holes density of 4.57×1021cm−3 are determined. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), measured over a wide frequency range (1mHz–105Hz), reveals the bulk contribution with a constant phase element (CPE). The straight line at 43° at low frequencies region is due to the Warburg diffusion. The energy diagram shows the feasibility of H2 photo-evolution with a low over-voltage. The best performance is achieved at pH∼7 in the presence of S2O32− as holes scavenger. A hydrogen liberation rate of 660μmolh−1 (g catalyst)−1 and a quantum efficiency of 0.21% under visible light (29mWcm−2) are determined. The system is valuable for the chemical storage through the uphill reaction: (S2O32−+3H2O→2SO32−+2H2+2H+, ΔGf°=24.3kJmol−1).

Abstract: A new and efficient push–pull organic semiconductor, DMM-TPA-Th2-MMN, with a planar fused triphenylamine (DMM-TPA) donor and a methylene malononitrile (MMN) acceptor was synthesized. The planar semiconductor exhibited better p-type semiconducting performance with a power conversion efficiency of 4.04% in solution-processed small-molecule organic solar cells than did the tilted TPA-Th2-MMN semiconductor, enhancing hole mobilities due to more favorable intermolecular π–π packing interactions.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a typical hypervascular tumor resulted from excessive growth of tumor cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that the lipoxygenase is considered as a potential therapeutic target and have important influence on human cancers. However, whether the 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LO-1)/15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) pathway participates in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported until now. To test the hypothesis that the 15-LO-1/15-HETE signaling regulates hepatocellular carcinoma cells growth and metastasis via the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/heat shock protein 90 pathway, we performed these studies. Our results showed that hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and SMMC7721) apoptosis and growth arrest occurred following blockade of the 15-LO pathway with a 15-LO-1 inhibitor or siRNA, and all the effects were reversed by exogenous 15-HETE. Meanwhile, 15-HETE strengthened the expression of phosphor-Akt and heat shock protein 90, and inhibited apoptosis induced by serum deprivation via promoting the interaction of Akt with heat shock protein 90. In addition, the invasion and migration of HepG2 enhanced by 15-HETE were both attenuated by the inhibitor of Akt or heat shock protein 90. These results indicate that the 15-LO-1/15-HETE pathway prevents hepatocellular carcinoma cells from apoptosis and promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via a specific intracellular signaling pathway centered by the interaction of Akt with heat shock protein 90, and suggest a new therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: Hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon germanium (µc-Si1–xGex:H), with the advantage of its narrower variable band gap and higher absorption coefficient over the conventional hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H), has been implemented as the bottom sub-cell absorber of the triple junction solar cells. By replacing µc-Si:H i-layer with µc-Si0.91Ge0.09:H i-layer in the triple junction solar cell, the bottom sub-cell thickness (Dbottom) could be reduced by almost a half, meanwhile a higher efficiency was attained. As a result, an initial efficiency of 12.02% in an a-Si:H/a-Si0.6Ge0.4:H/µc-Si0.91Ge0.09:H triple junction structure with a total cell thickness as small as 1800nm was achieved. It is demonstrated that the triple junction solar cell incorporating µc-Si1−xGex:H bottom sub-cell with high efficiency and a relatively low thickness has a high potential for cost-effective photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: We report the results of a study of the sulphurization time effects on Cu2ZnSnS4 absorbers and thin film solar cells prepared from dc-sputtered stacked metallic precursors. Three different time intervals, 10min, 30min and 60min, at maximum sulphurization temperature were considered. The effects of this parameter' change were studied both on the absorber layer properties and on the final solar cell performance. The composition, structure, morphology and thicknesses of the CZTS layers were analyzed. The electrical characterization of the absorber layer was carried out by measuring the transversal electrical resistance of the samples as a function of temperature. This study shows an increase of the conductivity activation energy from 10meV to 54meV for increasing sulphurization time from 10min to 60min. The solar cells were built with the following structure: SLG/Mo/CZTS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al/Ni:Al grid. Several ac response equivalent circuit models were tested to fit impedance measurements. The best results were used to extract the device series and shunt resistances and capacitances. Absorber layer's electronic properties were also determined using the Mott–Schottky method. The results show a decrease of the average acceptor doping density and built-in voltage, from 2.0×1017cm−3 to 6.5×1015cm−3 and from 0.71V to 0.51V, respectively, with increasing sulphurization time. These results also show an increase of the depletion region width from approximately 90nm–250nm.

Abstract: Background and objective
The purpose of this study is to establish a standardized postoperative rehabilitation protocol following limb salvage surgery (LSS) in patients with primary bone sarcoma in five major anatomical locations: distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal and total femur, humerus and shoulder girdle and pelvic resections.
Setting and design
Retrospective study.
Patients and methods
All LSSs were performed by an orthopedic oncology surgeon, and rehabilitation of all patients was based on a devised standardized rehabilitation protocol. Patient outcomes were measured using the modified Musculoskeletal Tumor Society–International Symposium on the Limb Salvage (MSTS–ISOLS) scoring system.
Results
A total of 59 patients received LSS in the above mentioned locations; endoprostheses were used in 49, bone allograft in five, while no replacements were made in five patients. At a mean follow-up of 24 months, the mean modified MSTS–ISOLS score for all patients was 87% (95% CI; 0.85–0.89). The highest scores were encountered for patients with distal femur replacement: 93% (95% CI; 0.91–0.95). Seven patients had interruption of more than six weeks in their rehabilitation and had a mean score of 71% (95% CI; 0.64–0.82).
Conclusion
The proposed rehabilitation protocol is a comprehensive, organized and applicable guideline to be used after performing LSS at the above mentioned anatomical locations. The use of standardized rehabilitation protocol resulted in improved patient functional outcome.

Abstract: Plasmons in noble metallic nanoparticles can be used in order to increase efficiency of energy transfer in solar cells of various configurations, mainly in diode-type setups. The origin of plasmonic effect is still not fully recognized and one of the important contributions to photocurrent enhancement results from the inclusion of non-conserved momentum interband transition in semiconductor as a consequence of absence of translational invariance in nanomodified system. We consider energy transfer efficiency via plasmons in nanoparticles and its dependency of nanoparticle radius. Fully-analytical, semiclassical approach for plasmons in spherical geometry is applied and efficiency of near-field absorption in semiconductor is estimated upon Fermi's golden rule. Finally, we link our results with experimental measurements of photocurrent gain in semiconductor silicon-diode setup with gold nanoparticles, which occur in positive qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Dysferlinopathies are a group of progressive muscular dystrophies characterized by mutations in the gene DYSF. These mutations cause scarcity or complete absence of dysferlin, a protein that is expressed in skeletal muscle and plays a role in membrane repair. Our objective was to unravel the proteins that constitute the dysferlin complex and their interaction within the complex using immunoprecipitation assays (IP), blue native gel electrophoresis (BN) in healthy adult skeletal muscle and healthy cultured myotubes, and fluorescence lifetime imaging–fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FLIM–FRET) analysis in healthy myotubes. The combination of immunoprecipitations and blue native electrophoresis allowed us to identify previously reported partners of dysferlin – such as caveolin-3, AHNAK, annexins, or Trim72/MG53 – and new interacting partners. Fluorescence lifetime imaging showed a direct interaction of dysferlin with Trim72/MG53, AHNAK, cytoplasmic dynein, myomesin-2 and calsequestrin-1, but not with caveolin-3 or dystrophin. In conclusion, although IP and BN are useful tools to identify the proteins in a complex, techniques such as fluorescence lifetime imaging analysis are needed to determine the direct and indirect interactions of these proteins within the complex. This knowledge may help us to better understand the roles of dysferlin in muscle tissue and identify new genes involved in muscular dystrophies in which the responsible gene is unknown.

The tetraspanin network modulates MT1-MMP cell surface trafficking,

Abstract: The membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) drives fundamental physiological and pathophysiological processes. Among other substrates, MT1-MMP cleaves components of the extracellular matrix and activates other matrix-cleaving proteases such as MMP-2. Trafficking is a highly effective means to modulate MT1-MMP cell surface expression, and hence regulate its function. Here, we describe the complex interaction of MT1-MMP with tetraspanins, their effects on MT1-MMP intracellular trafficking and proteolytic function. Tetraspanins are credited as membrane organizers that form a network within the membrane to regulate the trafficking of associated proteins. In short, we found MT1-MMP to interact with the tetraspanin-associated EWI-2 protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen. Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed this interaction and further revealed that MT1-MMP also stably interacts with distinct tetraspanins (CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, CD81, and CD82) and the tetraspanin-like MAL protein. By using different MT1-MMP truncation constructs and mutants, we observed that all tetraspanins and MAL associated with the hemopexin domain of MT1-MMP. Moreover, this interaction was independent of O-glycosylation of MT1-MMP and exclusively occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the respective subcellular compartment was identified by fitting the MT1-MMP interaction pattern to a model for post-translational processing of MT1-MMP. In addition, tetraspanins differentially affected the cell surface localization of MT1-MMP, its capacity to activate pro-MMP-2, and the collagen invasion capacity. Interestingly, the degree of tetraspanin-MT1-MMP association did not correlate with its impact on MT1-MMP function. Tetraspanins thus distinctly affect MT1-MMP subcellular localization and function, and may constitute an effective mechanism to control MT1-MMP-dependent proteolysis at the cell surface.

Abstract: Acetylcholinesterase expression is modulated in various types of tumor, which suggests it is associated with tumor development; however, the mechanism of acetylcholinesterase gene regulation in tumors remains unclear. Here, we report that acetylcholinesterase is aberrantly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer and is an evolutionarily conserved functional target of miR-212. Acetylcholinesterase expression was negatively regulated by miR-212 in vitro and was inversely correlated with miR-212 expression in vivo. In addition, acetylcholinesterase levels were increased, and miR-212 levels decreased, in non-small cell lung cancer cells during cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We further determined that acetylcholinesterase acted as a pro-apoptotic gene in non-small cell lung cells; and attenuated the growth of xenografts in nude mice when upregulated. In contrast, elevated miR-212 levels preserved the protective effect of acetylcholinesterase silencing by RNA interference against cisplatin-induced apoptosis, whereas restoration of miR-212-resistant synaptic acetylcholinesterase expression inhibited the miR-212 anti-apoptotic function. The results demonstrated that miR-212 exerted an anti-apoptotic effect through direct repression of synaptic acetylcholinesterase expression in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Taken together, our study revealed that synaptic acetylcholinesterase may be a tumor suppressor and is modulated by miR-212 in non-small cell lung cancer.

Glutamate release from platelets: Exocytosis versus glutamate transporter reversal,

Abstract: Platelets express neuronal and glial glutamate transporters EAAT 1–3 in the plasma membrane and vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT 1,2 in the membrane of secretory granules. This study is focused on the assessment of non-exocytotic glutamate release, that is, the unstimulated release, heteroexchange and glutamate transporter reversal in platelets. Using the glutamate dehydrogenase assay, the absence of unstimulated release of endogenous glutamate from platelets was demonstrated, even after inhibition of glutamate transporters and cytoplasmic enzyme glutamine synthetase by dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate and methionine sulfoximine, respectively. Depolarization of the plasma membrane by exposure to elevated [K+] did not induce the release of glutamate from platelets that was shown using the glutamate dehydrogenase assay and radiolabeled l-[14C]glutamate. Glutamate efflux by means of heteroexchange with transportable inhibitor of glutamate transporters dl-threo-β-hydroxyaspartate (dl-THA) was not observed. Furthermore, the protonophore cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazon (FCCP) and inhibitor of V-type H+-ATPase bafilomycin A1 also failed to stimulate the release of glutamate from platelets. However, exocytotic release of glutamate from secretory granules in response to thrombin stimulation was not prevented by elevated [K+], dl-THA, FCCP and bafilomycin A1. In contrast to nerve terminals, platelets cannot release glutamate in a non-exocytotic manner. Heteroexchange, transporter-mediated and unstimulated release of glutamate are not inherent to platelets. Therefore, platelets may be used as a peripheral marker/model for the analysis of glutamate uptake by brain nerve terminals only (direct function of transporters), whereas the mechanisms of glutamate release are different in platelets and nerve terminals. Glutamate is released by platelets exclusively by means of exocytosis. Also, reverse function of vesicular glutamate transporters of platelets is rather ambiguous.

Abstract: Rather consistent power conversion efficiencies have been achieved in organic solar cells throughout a wide range of active layer thicknesses (∼100nm to ∼800nm) by using a p-type polymer semiconductor with high hole transport mobility (∼1cm2V−1s−1) as the donor, and PC61BM as the acceptor. A comparison between standard and inverted device configurations demonstrates that the inverted configuration is more suitable for achieving thicker active layers when a high hole mobility donor is used. We attribute this to the longer hole collection path in the inverted structure, which can benefit from using a high hole mobility material. Our results will be very useful for the development of new semiconductor materials and the design of device structures for more feasible manufacturing of large area OPV devices via high speed roll-to-roll printing processes.

Abstract: Mitochondria-related myopathies (MM) are a group of different diseases defined by a varying degree of dysfunctions of the mitochondrial respiratory chain which leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation followed by oxidative stress and cellular damage. In mitochondrial myopathy muscle tissue an overexpression of antioxidant enzymes has been documented probably as an attempt to counteract the free radical generation. We previously documented, in human non-pathological muscle fibres, the expression of the augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), a sulfhydryl oxidase enzyme, whose presence is related to the mitochondria; indeed it has been demonstrated that ALR mainly localizes in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. Furthermore we reported, in different experimental models, in vivo and in vitro, the anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative capacities of ALR, achieved by up-regulating Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic family factors and the anti-apoptotic/anti-oxidative secretory isoform of clusterin (sClu). With the present study we aimed to determine ALR, Bcl-2 protein, clusterin and ROS expression in muscle tissue biopsies from MM-affected patients. Non-pathological muscle tissue was used as control. Enzymatic, histochemical, immunohistochemical and immune electron microscopy techniques were performed. The data obtained revealed in MM-derived muscle tissue, compared to non-pathological tissue, the over-expression of ROS, ALR and Bcl-2 and the induction of the nuclear, pro-apoptotic, isoform of clusterin (nCLU).

Abstract: Inverted bulk heterojunction organic solar cells have generated significant interest in organic photovoltaic research due to much improved life times. Efficiency maximization for a given polymer–acceptor blend requires control of thickness and morphology of various constituent layers. In this manuscript, we present our results on the thickness variation of various constituent layers, viz. ZnO (electron transport layer), blend layer of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (active layer) and MoO3 (hole extraction layer) vis-à-vis effect of morphology of layers and optical field distribution on the electrical performance of inverted organic solar cells. The peak performance of the devices occurs for 30nm thick ZnO films, 100nm thick active layer and 10nm of MoO3 layers with an average power conversion efficiency of approximately 3.2% and a fill factor of 61%. The maximization of the device performance upon thickness variation of device constituents appears to result from the combined effects of morphology and the optical electric field distribution in the active layer.

Abstract: The S component (LukS-PV) is one of the two components of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which is a pore-forming cytotoxin secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, with the ability to lyse leukocytes. In this study, LukS-PV had the ability to induce apoptosis in the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line THP-1. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of LukS-PV-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells treated with LukS-PV, resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induced G0/G1 arrest associated with an inhibition of cell cycle arrest regulatory protein (cyclin D1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as measured by flow cytometry (FCM). After 12h exposure to LukS-PV (1.00μM), annexin V-EGFP/propidium iodide (PI) FCM revealed that 19.5±3.6% of THP-1 cells were apoptotic, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining also revealed THP-1 cells were apoptotic. Chip analysis of 84 apoptosis-related genes demonstrated that 9 genes were up-regulated at least 2-fold and that 5 genes were down-regulated at least 2-fold in the treatment group when compared with levels in the control group. Western blotting reveled that the expression of caspase-8 increased significantly (approximately 4-fold). The levels of caspase-9, -3 and Bax increased significantly, and levels of Bcl-2 decreased rapidly with LukS-PV treatment. These data suggest that LukS-PV acts as an anti-leukemia agent and activates AML cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, LukS-PV may be a multi-targeting drug candidate for the prevention and therapy of AML.

Abstract: This paper addresses the achievements and challenges in a-Si:H/µc-Si:H tandem solar cell technology including production aspects. As an example we show figures of the module production at Masdar PV, with module conversion efficiencies reaching 10%. The process integration was supported by PVcomB, namely, by developing improved PECVD processes and transferring them to Masdar PV. The important role of the TCO substrate for producing high-efficiency modules at lowest possible costs is discussed. We show the results of tandem cells on thermally annealed ZnO:Al substrates, resulting in an improvement of 0.4–0.5% (abs) as a result of the TCO annealing, reaching a stable efficiency of 12.1% for a 1cm² solar cell and 11.6% for a mini module. The challenges in developing thin film silicon solar modules with higher efficiency than presently reached are discussed.

Abstract: The thermal time constant distribution of a photovoltaic panel has been measured experimentally. A wide spectrum, ranging between a few milliseconds and a few hours, has been detected. A simple thermal analysis can only explain time constants up to 500s. It was found that the lateral heat diffusion inside the solar cells was responsible for the observed phenomena. The reason was the top finger-shaped contact and the non-uniform characteristics of the individual solar cells, that gave rise to a non-uniform power distribution and hence a lateral transient heat transfer. The experiment demonstrated that the conventional method used for thermal characterization of semiconductor devices, involving electric preheating, should not be used for photovoltaic panels due to their large dimensions as compared to other electronic devices.

Abstract: The neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) has been reported to play potential roles in the development of neuroblastoma and human evolution. However, the exact regulation and function of this family is still unknown. In this study, the genes of NBPF family were found to be densely covered by many high-confidence ChIP-Seq peaks of NF-κB. The expressions of NBPF genes were thus deduced to be regulated by this transcription factor. The activities of NF-κB in HeLa, HepG2 and ECa109 cells were then manipulated with NF-κB activator (TNFα) and inhibitors (BAY11-7082 or p65 siRNA), and the expressions of NBPF genes in these cells were checked. As result, it was found that the expressions of NBPF genes were regulated by NF-κB in HeLa and HepG2 cells. Therefore, the genes of NBPF family were identified as new bona fide direct target genes of NF-κB. In addition, NBPF was also identified as a nuclear protein by in silico prediction and immunolocalization. Finally, the bioinformatics analysis revealed that most of NBPF proteins contained classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and a conserved DNA-binding domain similar to the transcription factor stat3b/dna complex or stat-1/dna complex in their N-terminals. Therefore, this study concluded that NBPF was nuclear protein that contained classical NLSs and conserved known DNA-binding domain, and its expression was regulated by another important transcription factor, NF-κB. These findings suggest that NBPF may function as DNA-binding transcription factor in nucleus, which provides important new insight into the functions of NBPF genes in the human cells.

Abstract: Various metal oxides are probed as extrinsic thin tunnel barriers in Semiconductor Insulator Semiconductor solar cells. Namely Al2O3, ZrO2, Y2O3, and La2O3 thin films are in between n-type ZnO:Al (AZO) and p-type Si substrates by means of Atomic Layer Deposition. Low reverse dark current–density as low as 3×10−7A/cm2, a fill factor up to 71.3%, and open-circuit voltage as high as 527mV are obtained, achieving conversion efficiency of 8% for the rare earth oxide La2O3. ZrO2 and notably Al2O3 show drawbacks in performance suggesting an adverse reactivity with AZO as also indicated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.

Abstract: Cell adhesion and spreading require integrins-mediated cell–extracellular matrix interaction. Integrins function through binding to extracellular matrix and subsequent clustering to initiate focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Lipid raft, a liquid ordered plasma membrane microdomain, has been reported to play major roles in membrane motility by regulating cell surface receptor function. Here, we identified that lipid raft integrity was required for β1 integrin-mediated initial spreading of melanoma A375 cells on fibronectin. We found that lipid raft disruption with methyl-β-cyclodextrin led to the inability of focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement by preventing β1 integrin clustering. Furthermore, we explored the possible mechanism by which lipid raft regulates β1 integrin clustering and demonstrated that intact lipid raft could recruit and modify some adaptor proteins, such as talin, α-actinin, vinculin, paxillin and FAK. Lipid raft could regulate the location of these proteins in lipid raft fractions and facilitate their binding to β1 integrin, which may be crucial for β1 integrin clustering. We also showed that lipid raft disruption impaired A375 cell migration in both transwell and wound healing models. Together, these findings provide a new insight for the relationship between lipid raft and the regulation of integrins.

Cobalt stimulates HIF-1-dependent but inhibits HIF-2-dependent gene expression in liver cancer cells,

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcriptional regulators that mediate the cellular response to low oxygen. Although HIF-1 is usually considered as the principal mediator of hypoxic adaptation, several tissues and different cell types express both HIF-1 and HIF-2 isoforms under hypoxia or when treated with hypoxia mimetic chemicals such as cobalt. However, the similarities or differences between HIF-1 and HIF-2, in terms of their tissue- and inducer-specific activation and function, are not adequately characterized. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of true hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics on HIF-1 and HIF-2 induction and specific gene transcriptional activity in two hepatic cancer cell lines, Huh7 and HepG2. Both hypoxia and cobalt caused rapid induction of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins. Hypoxia induced erythropoietin (EPO) expression and secretion in a HIF-2-dependent way. Surprisingly, however, EPO expression was not induced when cells were treated with cobalt. In agreement, both HIF-1- and HIF-2-dependent promoters (of PGK and SOD2 genes, respectively) were activated by hypoxia while cobalt only activated the HIF-1-dependent PGK promoter. Unlike cobalt, other hypoxia mimetics such as DFO and DMOG activated both types of promoters. Furthermore, cobalt impaired the hypoxic stimulation of HIF-2, but not HIF-1, activity and cobalt-induced HIF-2α interacted poorly with USF-2, a HIF-2-specific co-activator. These data show that, despite similar induction of HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein expression, HIF-1 and HIF-2 specific gene activating functions respond differently to different stimuli and suggest the operation of oxygen-independent and gene- or tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms involving additional transcription factors or co-activators.

Abstract: Commonly, wet etched transparent conductive oxide (TCO) is used as a textured window electrode of hydrogenated amorphous thin film silicon solar cells. This study demonstrates a novel light trapping solutions using electrochemically deposited zinc oxide nanorod arrays to replace standard light management concepts. Here we systematically investigate the influence of rod size and array geometries on the solar cell efficiency and correlate our experimental results to multidimensional solar cell simulations. Especially, the requirement is demonstrated to match the solar cell design to the nanorod geometry which strongly influences the electrical cell characteristic. The results clearly outline the potential of TCO nanorod technology regarding the light trapping effect in silicon based thin film solar cells.

Abstract: This article reports a prototype of a sandwich-structured solar cell. A thin layer of three dimensional Si nanofiber was created between the p-type and n-type layers in a single homojunction silicon cell. This nanofibre layer, which works as a “space region”, was synthesized using MHz ultrafast laser ablation at ambient conditions. The high surface area of the nanofibrous layer having a certain degree of porosity enhances the excitation (hole/electron) when compared to the traditional p–n junction. Characterization with a standard solar simulator revealed improved device efficiency. The highest open circuit voltage, short circuit current and the maximum solar cell efficiency obtained are 16.21mA/cm2, 0.95V, and 12.1%, respectively. It has been shown that the efficiency increases as the thickness of the nanofiber layer increases.

Abstract: The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity. The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2–7% in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10–15%. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25% variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost. The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.

Abstract: Form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) possess the advantages of direct use without additional encapsulation, making their practical applications more feasible comparing to solid–liquid PCMs. In this paper, a new kind of myristic acid (MA)/polyaniline (PANI) form-stable PCMs were readily prepared by means of surface polymerization method. MA and PANI were applied as thermal energy storage material and supporting material, respectively. Morphology and structure characterization revealed that in the form-stable PCMs, MA particles were wrapped by PANI particles, which in turn were polymerized from aniline. Thermal stability and thermal energy storage properties of the prepared form-stable PCMs were investigated by means of thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results indicated that the form-stable PCMs exhibited good thermal stability when their phase change temperature was concerned. The highest loading of MA in the form-stable PCM with good form stability could attain 82wt%, corresponding to the phase change enthalpy of 150.63J/g.

Abstract: This work presents the design and synthesis of a series of novel 2-benzylquinuclidine derivatives, comprising 12 methiodide and 11 hydrochloride salts, and their structural and pharmacological characterization at the human (h) α7 and α4β2 nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). The antagonistic potency of these compounds was tested by Ca2+ influx assays on cells expressing the hα7 or hα4β2 nAChR subtype. To determine the inhibitory mechanisms, additional radioligand binding experiments were performed. The results indicate that the methiodides present the highest affinities for the hα7 nAChR agonist sites, while the same compounds bind preferably to the hα4β2 nAChR ion channel domain. These results indicate that the methiodides are competitive antagonists of the hα7 nAChR but noncompetitive antagonists of the hα4β2 subtype. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the methiodide derivative 8d binds to the hα7 orthosteric binding sites by forming stable cation-π interactions between the quaternized quinulinuim moiety and the aromatic box in the receptor, whereas compounds 7j and 8j block the hα4β2 AChR ion channel by interacting with a luminal domain formed between the serine (position 6′) and valine (position 13′) rings that overlaps the imipramine binding site.

Abstract: We utilize an adsorption/desorption process between the excess acetic acid in solution and the bound oleate ions on the surface of CdSe quantum dots to achieve ligand exchange process in the hybrid film of poly (3-hexylthione) (P3HT): CdSe quantum dots (QDs). By this post-deposition ligand exchange method, we achieved hybrid solar cells with power conversion efficiency of nearly 2% at low annealing temperature (120°C). Compared to the thiols that are widely used in hybrid solar cells, acetic acid shows its advantages of environmental friendliness, non-toxicity and mild odors. As such, our method is attractive for future hybrid solar cell applications.

Heme oxygenase-1 induces 15-lipoxygenase expression during hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension,

Abstract: We previously reported that 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) induced by hypoxia catalyzed the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) into 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), which plays an essential role in the development of hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPH). However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia up-regulated 15-LO are still unclear. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an oxygen-dependent enzyme regulating vascular tone and cell proliferation, was implicated in HPH and was promoted by hypoxia. Therefore, the present study was carried out to determine whether hypoxia induced the expression of 15-LO via the HO-1 pathway. To test this hypothesis, we studied the role of HO-1 in HPH and 15-LO/15-HETE expression We found increased right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary arteries (PAs) reactivity to vasoconstrictors as well as intima-to-media ratio of PAs in HO-1 overexpressing transgenic mice. Moreover, HO-1 up-regulated 15-LO transcription and translation as well as 15-HETE in both transgenic mice and cultured pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Results from immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry showed the interaction and colocalization of HO-1 and 15-LO. Together, these data suggest that HO-1 is an important upstream mediator in the hypoxia-induced 15-LO up-regulation during HPH. Unveiling the relevance of HO-1 signaling in PHP provides attractive treatment targets for HPH.

Abstract: Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum as a molecular chaperone. It has also been found on the membranes of some cancer cells, acting as a receptor for a wide variety of ligands. However, its presence on colorectal cancer (CRC) cell surface and its role in CRC metastatic progression remain elusive. Here we reported that GRP78 was predominantly present in the form of clustering aggregates on CRC cell surfaces, and its surface abundance was strongly correlated with CRC differentiation stage. Interestingly, we observed that cell-surface GRP78 had an interaction with the ECM adhesion molecule β1-integrin and was involved in cell-matrix adhesion through regulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Moreover, the present data also implicated that surface GRP78 promoted the cell invasion process, and this effect was at least partly mediated through its association with uPA–uPAR protease system. Together, our data suggests that surface GRP78 promotes CRC cell migration and invasion by regulating cell-matrix adhesion and ECM degradation, which is independent of its signaling receptor function.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the comprehension and optimization of the rear side of n-type amorphous/crystalline (a-Si:H/c-Si) heterojunction solar cells. The back amorphous stack and the role of the heterointerface have been investigated in order to elucidate the basic mechanisms governing device performance. Thus, thin amorphous silicon films with different phosphorous contents have been deposited by PECVD and extensively characterised (optical, electrical, and structural properties have been studied). Moreover, the passivation and the interface properties of such different a-Si:H thin films on crystalline silicon surface have been also investigated by Quasi-Steady-State Photoconductance (QSSPC) measurements. The effect of the doping content of the amorphous back-surface-field was deeply analysed and simulated in order to explain the observed tendencies on solar cell precursors. The influence of defect density and activation energy on the carrier transport properties varying with the doping of thin a-Si:H layers has been widely investigated. Furthermore, optimized heterojunction solar cells have been fabricated and an efficiency of 20.5% on n-type 148cm2 silicon wafer has been achieved.

Abstract: A method to determine the effect of cell-to-cell non-uniformity on CPV module performance is applied to a high-concentration photovoltaic system, comprising a linear semi-dense array of 5 series-connected 1cm2 triple-junction concentrator cells (lattice-matched GaInP/GaAs/Ge). Characteristic irradiance distributions were obtained by Monte Carlo ray-tracing of the concentrator optical system. Spatial apodizing filters were then produced such that, when illuminated with a spatially uniform radiation source, the desired irradiance distribution is obtained behind the filter. An equivalent circuit model of the array was developed and fitted against reference uniform irradiance measurements at concentrations ranging from 10x to 1678x. The fitted model was then validated vis-à-vis measurements under non-uniform irradiance imposed by the filters at concentrations from 99x to 494x. Both experimental and simulated results show a characteristic stepped I–V behavior associated with irradiance mismatch in series-connected arrays. Under the worst-case conditions of irradiance mismatch over the array, the efficiency drops to 28.5% as compared to 39% for the case of perfect uniformity. Due to the translational symmetry of the primary concentrator, a redesign of the module with parallel cell interconnects enables to mitigate the effects of irradiance mismatch. The methods provide an experimentally verifiable approach to determine the effect of irradiance mismatch on concentrator solar cell arrays without the need for prototyping of the concentrator optics. They may further be applied to determine the underlying characteristics and properties of cells and arrays subjected to nonuniform irradiation.

Abstract: A phase change material consisting of three-dimensional graphene aerogel (GA) and octadecanoic acid (OA) was produced. The GA was assembled from the sheets of graphene oxide in a hydrothermal reaction. The pore sizes of the network were several micrometers and the pore walls consisted of thin layers of stacked graphene sheets. OA was impregnated into GA by capillary forces, with the GA acting as the support. The GA/OA composite had a thermal conductivity about 2.635W/mK at a GA loading fraction of ∼20vol%, which was about 14 times that of the OA (0.184W/mK). The transient heating and cooling responses of the material were investigated for thermal energy storage. The GA had a low bulk density so that the weight percent of the GA in the composite was only about 15%. The composite presents a high heat storage capacity of 181.8J/g, which was very close to the value of the OA alone (186.1J/g).

Abstract: We demonstrate the impact of the hole extraction efficiency on the device performance and stability of organic solar cells. We present results on organic solar cells prepared with a poly(aniline) (PANI) based hole transport layer (HTL) blended with varying concentrations of poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), leading to differences in the HTL transmittance and conductivity. The PANI to PSS ratios investigated here were 1:1, 1:2 and 1:5. The initial power conversion efficiency of the devices is demonstrated to depend directly on the HTL conductivity, showing increasing performance with decreasing PSS content. However, after degradation of encapsulated solar cells under illumination, it is observed that the higher PSS content results in better stability. Data from impedance spectroscopy offers detailed insight into the interface properties, and detailed equivalent circuit analysis allows us to correlate the decreased hole extraction capabilities to the HTL properties and to the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell.

Abstract: A novel single source three-stage evaporation process has been developed to deposit CuIn1−xGaxSe2 absorber layers well suited for thin films solar cells. By varying the electron beam current and substrate temperature for each stage, the film structure, texture, morphology, composition and composition profile can be controlled precisely. The thin films are well crystallized with compact and faceted grains, with sizes ranging from 1 to 1.5µm and also predominantly textured along [112] direction. The elemental compositions are well controlled with Cu:(In+Ga) of 0.85:0.87 and Ga:(In+Ga) of 0.25:0.26, which is within the range for the highest efficiency CIGS solar cells. Photoluminescence and Raman spectra verify that the as-deposited thin films have desired optical properties, and secondary ion mass spectra composition depth profiling suggests that the thin films have graded bandgaps. Thin film solar cells fabricated with such films achieved a power conversion efficiency of 10.6%. This approach avoids the complexity and large area uniformity issues of co-evaporation, and therefore is promising for in-line CIGS film fabrication using the evaporation method.

Abstract: We investigated the role of carbohydrate antigen sialyl-Lewis a (sLea), an E-selectin ligand and epitope of tumor marker CA19.9, in the development of xenografts in nude mice. To this end, animals were inoculated with the human colon cancer cell line HCT-15, expressing no Lewis antigens, or with a clone expressing sLea (HCT-15-T5). The size of HCT-15-T5 xenografts appeared larger than those of HCT-15 and their average weight was over twice bigger. In both xenografts the mitotic index was found elevated, as determined by Ki-67 assay, and no apoptosis was detected in the tumor cells by both caspase 8 or TUNEL assays. Some apoptotic signals were instead detected in the vessels. Conversely, microvessel density, determined through CD-31 immunohistochemistry, was found 3.2-folds bigger in HCT-15-T5 xenografts (p<0.012). Only the membranes of HCT-15-T5 cells grown as xenografts reacted intensively with the anti CA19.9 antibody 1116-NS-19-9 by immunofluorescence, but not by immunohistochemistry. Unknown structures were instead stained by such technique in both xenografts, as were in mouse tissues not expressing the antigen and in human colon adenocarcinoma. We conclude that expression of sLea on the surface of colon cancer cells improves xenograft growth and is associated with enhanced angiogenesis, while immunohistochemistry with 1116-NS-19-9 antibody appears not suitable to determine CA19.9 expression.

Abstract: The thrombopoietin receptor is a crucial element in thrombopoietin-initiated signaling pathways, which stimulates the differentiation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, the maturation of megakaryocytes, and the generation of platelets. In this study, we identified a novel activating variant of thrombopoietin receptor, termed Mpl-D, in human megakaryoblastic leukemia Dami cells and demonstrated that the binding affinity of the Mpl-D receptor for thrombopoietin is enhanced. Cell cycle analysis revealed that in the presence of thrombopoietin, most Mpl-D expressing NIH3T3 (NIH3T3/Mpl-D) cells were prevalent in G1 phase while the S and G2/M populations were less frequently observed. Unexpectedly, thrombopoietin induced strong and prolonged ERK1/2 signaling in NIH3T3/Mpl-D cells compared with its receptor wild-type expressing NIH3T3 (NIH3T3/Mpl-F) cells. Further analysis of the mRNA levels of cyclin D1/D2 in NIH3T3/Mpl-D cells demonstrated markedly down-regulated expression compared to NIH3T3/Mpl-F cells in the presence of thrombopoietin. Thus, the prolonged activation of ERK1/2 by Mpl-D might lead to G1 cell cycle arrest through a profound reduction of cyclin D1/D2 in order to support cell survival without proliferation. We also provided tertiary structural basis for the Mpl-D and thrombopoietin interaction, which might provide insights into how Mpl-D effectively increases binding to thrombopoietin and significantly contributes to its specific signaling pathway. These results suggest a new paradigm for the regulation of cytokine receptor expression and function through the alternative splicing variant of Mpl in Dami cells, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of megakaryoblastic leukemia.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between growth factors and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) signaling remains a crucial issue to optimize the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and BMPs in bone tissue engineering. BMP9 is highly capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is abundantly secreted during the healing process of fractures or in surgery bone sites. Herein, we explore the detail effect of FGF2 on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. It was found that FGF2 inhibited BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation by blocking BMP9-induced Smads signaling and subsequently reducing Smads dependent up-regulation of ALK1 and ALK2 in MSCs. This effect was rescued by exogenous expression of ALK1 and ALK2, which are proved to be receptors for BMP9. Our results discovered a clue to explain the mechanism involved in the inhibitory effect of FGF2 on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. This crosstalk between FGF2 and BMP9 should be emphasized in the future use of BMP9 in therapeutic purpose of fracture repair.

Abstract: Of the materials of current research interest in thin-film photovoltaics, Ru and Te are amongst the nine rarest elements in the earth's crust, with In and Se in positions 11 and 14, raising the issue as to what constraints, if any, are placed on future thin-film photovoltaic manufacturing volumes by such scarcity. Te provides an interesting case study since more than 600t has been incorporated into CdTe modules fielded to-date, with CdTe technology recently consolidating its position as the most successful commercial thin-film technology. The origin and impacts of recent fluctuating Te market conditions are discussed as are new insights into long-term supply from Cu refining.

Abstract: The influence of the buffer layer thickness and the thiourea concentration in chemical bath on the cell performance of ZnS(O,OH)/CIGS solar cells was investigated. It was found that a high efficiency CIGS solar cell could be achieved by increasing the thiourea concentration in the chemical bath deposition (CBD) solution even if a very thin ZnS(O,OH) buffer layer (10nm) was used. As a result, the CBD deposition time could be shortened to one six as compared to that of thicker buffer layer thickness of 120nm. The results are discussed in connection with the conduction band offset at the ZnS(O,OH)/CIGS interface.

Abstract: Effects of oxygen plasma (O2 plasma) treatment of ITO on the characteristics of solution-processed molybdenum oxide (MoO3) hole extraction layer in bulk hetero-junction organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are studied. The chemical composition of O2 plasma-treated ITO was determined using monochromatic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The valence band energies were investigated by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. XPS and UPS measurements reveal that O2 plasma treatment of bare ITO film was found to incorporate the polar surface species such as (O2)2−, resulting in an increase of both workfunction from 4.62 to 5.05eV and polar surface energy from 27 to 38mN/m. The high work function results in efficient hole transport at the ITO/MoO3 interfaces. The highly polar surface is readily available for uniform coating of MoO3 on ITO. Electrical conductivity of oxidized ITO changes four orders of magnitude from 2.4×10–2 to 4.08×102S/cm, depending on O2 plasma pressure conditions. Thus, the ITO/MoO3 interface dominates the series resistance of OPVs fabricated with poly(3-hexylthiophene) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM). The presence of (O2)2− states in the ITO/MoO3 interface in OPVs is suggested to play a significant role in controlling the device lifetime as well as the efficiency of OPV.

A wafer-based monocrystalline silicon photovoltaics road map: Utilizing known technology improvement opportunities for further reductions in manufacturing costs,

Abstract: As an initial investigation into the current and potential economics of one of today's most widely deployed photovoltaic technologies, we have engaged in a detailed analysis of manufacturing costs for each step within the wafer-based monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) PV module supply chain. At each step we find several pathways that could lead to further reductions in manufacturing costs. After aggregating the performance and cost considerations for a series of known technical improvement opportunities, we project a pathway for commercial-production c-Si modules to have typical sunlight power conversion efficiencies of 19–23%, and we calculate that they might be sustainably sold at ex-factory gate prices of $0.60–$0.70 per peak Watt (DC power, current U.S. dollars). This may not be the lower bound to the cost curve for c-Si, however, because the roadmap described in this paper is constrained by the boundary conditions set by the wire sawing of wafers and their incorporation into manufacturing equipment that is currently being developed for commercial-scale production. Within these boundary conditions, we find that the benefit of reducing the wafer thickness from today's standard 180μm to the handling limit of 80μm could be around $0.05 per peak Watt (Wp), when the calculation is run at minimum sustainable polysilicon prices (which we calculate to be around $23/kg). At that minimum sustainable polysilicon price, we also calculate that the benefit of completely eliminating or completely recycling kerf loss could be up to $0.08/Wp. These downward adjustments to the long run wafer price are used within the cost projections for three advanced cell architectures beyond today's standard c-Si solar cell. Presumably, the higher efficiency cells that are profiled must be built upon a foundation of higher quality starting wafers. The prevailing conventional wisdom is that this should add cost at the ingot and wafering step—either due to lower production yields when having to sell wafers that are doped with an alternative element other than the standard choice of boron, or in additional capital equipment costs associated with removing problematic boron–oxygen pairs. However, from our survey it appears that there does not necessarily need to be an assumption of a higher wafer price if cell manufacturers should wish to use n-type wafers derived from the phosphorus dopant. And as for making p-type wafers with the traditional boron dopant, the potential price premium for higher lifetimes via the magnetic Czochralski approach is calculated to be very small, and can ostensibly be offset by the higher expected cell efficiencies that would result from using the higher quality wafers. With this final consideration, the projected minimum sustainable price requirements for three advanced c-Si solar cells are incorporated into a final bill of materials for a polysilicon-to-module manufacturing facility located within the United States.

Abstract: Sodium is known to play an important role for the performance optimization of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) thin film solar cells, i.e. it is found to significantly increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC). For this work CIGSe absorbers were produced in a low temperature deposition process on polyimide substrates with varying sodium content. In agreement with previous studies we find an increase of VOC and overall solar cell performance with increasing sodium content and a decrease of the overall performance for very high sodium content. At the same time time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicate that the minority carrier lifetime decreases from 50ns to about 5ns for increasing sodium content in the absorber. This correlation was found to be valid for three different types of low-temperature CIGSe deposition processes. The results can be explained by an increase in deep defect density with increasing Na content, proportional to the increased net charge carrier density as measured by capacitance–voltage profiling. For very high sodium content this leads to an actual decrease in the overall performance of the solar cells.

Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is prevalent in southern China, northern Africa, and Alaska. The prognosis for NPC patients at early stage is good, while it is poor for patients at late stages. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been proposed to be associated with tumor initiation, relapse and metastasis, and the poor prognosis of NPC likely results from residual CSCs after therapy. Study on the therapy targeting CSCs in NPC remains poor, though it received intensive attentions in other cancers. Here, we used NPC cell lines with high and low proportion of CSCs as models to explore the effect of nigericin, an antibiotic, on CSCs. We found that nigericin could selectively target CSCs and sensitize CSCs in NPC to the widely used clinical drug cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, downregulation of the polycomb group protein Bmi-1 may contribute to the inhibitory effect of nigericin on CSCs. Furthermore, by using the in vitro NPC cell models, we found that nigericin could significantly decrease the migration and invasion abilities, which are known to be associated with CSCs. Taken together, our results suggest that nigericin can selectively target CSCs in NPC, which could be a candidate CSCs targeting drug for clinical evaluation.

Abstract: Sputter-deposited ZnO:Al thin films, used as front contact in thin-film Si solar cells, were etched in diluted HCl containing catalytic amounts of Fe(III) salts. The Fe(III) effectively catalyzes the HCl-based etch process, leading to a crater-like morphology that is qualitatively similar to the one generated by the uncatalyzed etching process at the same HCl concentrations. Utilizing this catalyzed process, an increase of the etching rate by a factor of approximately 1.8–2.6 was observed. This allows for a well-controllable tuning of the etch duration without changing HCl concentration or temperature. The process has been evaluated with a selection of Fe(III) salts at different concentrations of the acid and of the catalyst. Optical, electrical and scanning force microscopic characterization of such catalytically etched ZnO:Al films has shown that the catalytical process leads to slightly smaller morphological features on the film compared to the uncatalyzed etching, accompanied by a shift of light scattering intensity to higher angles. This etching behavior may be used beneficially for light trapping in thin-film Si solar cells. In addition to these application-oriented aspects, this approach provides a deeper insight into the mechanistical details of the ZnO thin-film dissolution.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical study of the role of a two-dimensional photonic crystal in an organic solar cell. In particular, we use some specific resonant modes of the photonic crystal, that are not guided modes, to favor light trapping in the absorbing medium. The increase of optical path in the active layer causes an increase of absorption at some particular frequencies. A frequential-temporal analysis has been made to highlight the correspondence between absorption enhancement and photonic crystal resonant modes, in a thin absorbing slab. In addition we present possible designs that would broaden the absorption spectrum of the bulk material. Finally, we study a complete organic bulk heterojunction solar cell made of a 50nm-thick active layer, and a patterned ITO electrode. In such device, the well known trade-off between carrier extraction and light absorption can appear as a constraint. Our challenge is to obtain a high absorption in an ultra thin active layer solar cell, by using a light trapping effect.

Abstract: We investigate local electronic properties of cadmium telluride solar cells using electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements with patterned contacts. EBIC measurements are performed with a spatial resolution as high as ≈20nm both on the top surface and throughout the cross-section of the device, revealing a remarkable degree of electrical inhomogeneity near the p–n junction and enhanced carrier collection in the vicinity of grain boundaries (GB). Simulation results of low energy EBIC suggest that the band bending near a GB is downward, with a magnitude of at least 0.2eV for the most effective current-collecting GBs. Furthermore, we demonstrate a new approach to investigate local open-circuit voltage by applying an external bias across electrical contact with a point electron-beam injection. The length scale of the nanocontacts is on the length scale of a single or a few grains, confining current path with highly localized photo-generated carriers.

Abstract: In this work we present reflectance imaging as a suitable method for in situ monitoring of the drying process of film formation for organic photovoltaics (OPV) over large areas, as well as for lab-scale spin-coating. The drying wet film is illuminated with a narrow bandwidth LED with the specularly reflected light recorded by a video camera as the film dries and forms the active layer of the OPV cell. The interference fringes generated by the thinning wet film can be used to measure the rate of solvent evaporation and the drying time. Subsequent mapping elucidates variations in drying conditions over the substrate, which lead to variations in morphology formation. The technique is suitable for tracking thickness variations of the dry film, with a sensitivity of ≈10nm, by comparing the intensity of the reflected light from the dry film to simulated interference conditions calculated for each thickness. The drying process is furthermore accurately simulated by an optical model considering the changes in refractive index as the amount of solvent decreases with respect to the solid content. This non-invasive in situ method represents an important monitoring tool for future large scale OPV manufacturing where high performing morphologies with uniform thickness have to be formed over very large areas.

Abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, is the primary trigger of sepsis, which is associated with high mortality in patients. No therapeutic agents are currently efficacious enough to protect patients from sepsis characterized by LPS-mediated tissue damage and organ failure. Previously, a phosvitin-derived peptide, Pt5, which consists of the C-terminal 55 residues of zebrafish phosvitin, has been shown to function as an antibacterial agent. In this study, we have generated six mutants by site-directed mutagenesis based on the sequence of Pt5, and found that one of the six mutants, Pt5e, showed the strongest bactericidal activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. We then demonstrated that Pt5e was able to bind to LPS and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). More importantly, we showed that Pt5e significantly inhibited LPS-induced tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β release from murine RAW264.7 cells and considerably reduced serum TNF-α and IL-1β levels in mice. Additionally, Pt5e protected the liver from damage by LPS, and remarkably promoted the survival rate of the endotoxemia mice. Furthermore, Pt5e displayed no cytotoxicity to murine RAW264.7 macrophages and no hemolytic activity toward human red blood cells. These data together indicate that Pt5e is an endotoxin-neutralizing agent with a therapeutic potential in clinical treatment of LPS-induced sepsis.

Abstract: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) motility and plasticity, functions that are influenced by environmental cues, are vital to adaptation and remodelling in vascular physiology and pathophysiology. Lp(a) is reportedly damaging to SMC function via unknown molecular mechanisms. Apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), a unique glycoprotein moiety of Lp(a), has been demonstrated as its active component. The aims of this study were to determine functional effects of recombinant apo(a) on human vascular SMC motility and explore the underlying mechanism(s). Exposure of SMC to apo(a) in migration assays induced a potent, concentration-dependent chemorepulsion that was RhoA and integrin αVβ3-dependent, but transforming growth factor β-independent. SMC manipulation through RhoA gene silencing, Rho kinase inhibition, statin pre-treatment, αVβ3 neutralising antibody and tyrosine kinase inhibition all markedly inhibited apo(a)-mediated SMC migration. Our data reveal unique and potent activities of apo(a) that may negatively influence SMC remodelling in cardiovascular disease. Circulating levels of Lp(a) are resistant to lipid-lowering strategies and hence a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying its functional effects on SMC may provide alternative therapeutic targets.

Abstract: For the first time, a novel rear contacting structure for copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) thin film solar cells is discussed theoretically, developed in an industrially viable way, and demonstrated in tangible devices. The proposed cell design reduces back contacting area by combining a rear surface passivation layer and nano-sized local point contacts. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 is used to passivate the CIGS surface and the formation of nano-sphere shaped precipitates in chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdS to generate point contact openings. The Al2O3 rear surface passivated CIGS solar cells with nano-sized local rear point contacts show a significant improvement in open circuit voltage (VOC) compared to unpassivated reference cells. Comparing the passivated devices to solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) modeling indicates that this increase is attributed to a decrease in rear surface recombination of a few orders.

Abstract: Several lines of evidence suggest that specific transcriptional events are involved in cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation processes; however, their deregulation by proto-oncogenes are involved in the development of leukemia and tumors. One such proto-oncogene is ecotropic viral integration site I which can differentially effect cell cycle progression and proliferation, in cell types of different origin. Our data for the first time shows that ecotropic viral integration site I binds to ΔNp63 promoter element directly and down regulates its expression. Down regulation of ΔNp63 induces the expression of p21 in HT-29 cells and also in colon carcinoma cells that do not express p53 including patient samples expressing low level of p53, that eventually delay cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase. Concomitant silencing of ecotropic viral integration site I from the cells or introduction of ΔNp63 to the cells significantly rescued this phenotype, indicating the growth defect induced by ΔNp63 deficiency to be, at least in part, attributable to ecotropic viral integration site I function. The mutual regulation between ecotropic viral integration site I and ΔNp63 may constitute a novel axis which might affect the downstream pathways in cells that do not express functional p53.

Survivin up-regulates the expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) through attenuating the suppression of p53 on NF-κB expression in MCF-7/5-FU cells,

Abstract: Both breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) and apoptosis-related molecules are involved in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. However, the association of BCRP with apoptosis-related molecules in the development of MDR is unknown. In this study, we investigated the changes in expression levels of BCRP, Survivin, p53, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Bax in cultured MCF-7 and MCF-7/5-FU cells, and explored whether these changes affected the expressions of BCRP. Our data showed that the protein and mRNA expression levels of BCRP, Survivin and Bcl-2 were significantly higher in MCF-7/5-FU cells than in MCF-7 cells, while p53 expression lower in MCF-7/5-FU cells than in MCF-7 cells. Knockdown of Survivin or Bcl-2 in MCF-7/5-FU cells and overexpression of Survivin in MCF-7 cells revealed that Survivin had significant association with BCRP expression. Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that Survivin up-regulated BCRP expression at transcriptional level and this response was mediated through NF-κB(p50) pathway. However, may be due to the physical interaction between p53 and Survivin, p53 directly affected Survivin-regulated BCRP expressions. Interestingly, we found that Survivin would suppress p53 expression. Furthermore, our data revealed that Survivin itself had no apparent effect on NF-κB(p50) and BCRP expression when knockdown of p53 in MCF-7 cells; whereas p53 exerted significant inhibitory action on these when knockdown of Survivin. In conclusion, through down regulation of p53 expression, Survivin attenuates the suppressing effect of p53 on NF-κB(p50) expression and then enhances BCRP expression. This may represent a novel strategy for reversal of BCRP drug transporter activity to modulate MDR in cancer cells.

Abstract: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a rate limiting step in arachidonic acid cascade, plays a key role in the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) upon inflammatory stimuli, growth factors, hormones and other cellular stresses. Overproduction of PGE2 stimulates proliferation of various cancer cells, confers resistance to apoptosis and favors metastasis and angiogenesis. The steady-state level of PGE2 is maintained by interplay between the biosynthetic pathway including COX and PGE2 synthases and the catabolic pathways involving nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). 15-PGDH is a crucial enzyme responsible for the biological inactivation of PGE2. Adult hepatocytes fail to induce COX-2 expression regardless of the pro-inflammatory factors used. COX-2 is induced in hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy (PH), in animal models of cirrhosis, in human hepatoma cell lines, in human HCC and after HBV and HCV infection. However, no data are available regarding 15-PGDH expression in HCC. Our results show that 15-PGDH is downregulated in human hepatoma cells with a high COX-2 expression, in chemical and genetic murine models of HCC and in human HCC biopsies. Moreover, 15-PGDH expression is suppressed by EGF (epidermal growth factor) and HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) mainly involving PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activation. Conversely, ectopic expression of 15-PGDH induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells and decreases the growth of hepatoma cells in nude mice whereas the silencing of 15-PGDH increases the tumor formation. These data suggest a potential therapeutic application of 15-PGDH in HCC.

Abstract: The optical transmission of single metal thin films is usually wavelength dependent, due to plasma formation as well as intraband electronic transitions. In this paper we show that alloys can present a much smoother wavelength optical response, as it is the case of films containing 50% of Cu and 50% of Ag deposited on a transparent substrate. The optimized optical transparency and electrical resistance properties of the ultrathin alloy film (10nm), combined with the high work function and environmental stability provided by a Ni capping layer, have allowed achieving organic photovoltaic cells almost as efficient as those incorporating indium tin oxide (ITO), which is the most widely used transparent electrode. Compared to ITO, the proposed structures are more compatible with organic materials and mechanically ductile, and less expensive, making them ideal for flexible optoelectronic devices produced by roll-to-roll techniques.

Abstract: Although H2O2 is traditionally known to have cytotoxic effects, recent studies argue about its regulatory role on lipid metabolism. However, the mechanism underlying the induction of lipid biosynthesis by oxidative stress still remains unknown. To shed light on this aspect we investigated the H2O2-induced lipogenesis in rat liver BRL-3A cells. We found that a short-term exposition of cells to 35μM H2O2 didn’t cause any significant sign of cell damage measured by following diene formation and lactate dehydrogenase release from cells. However, in this stressful condition, a significant increase of [1-14C]acetate incorporation into fatty acids and cholesterol, associated to an increase in the activity and expression of key enzymes of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, were measured. mRNA and protein contents of the transcription factors SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, involved in the activation of lipid synthesis, increased as well. The analysis of molecular mechanism of SREBP-1 activation revealed, in treated compared to control cells, a higher SREBP-1a mRNA translation involving an internal ribosome entry side (IRES), present in the leader region of its mRNA. Longer exposition to the pro-oxidant induced a progressive loss of cell viability together with an increase of cell triacylglycerol content.

Abstract: Adrenomedullin (AM) is a novel vasodilatory peptide, which acts primarily through the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) in combination with either receptor-activity-modifying-protein (RAMP) 2 or 3 (forming receptors, AM1 and AM2 respectively). AM is also highly expressed in the brain and it has shown neuropeptide characteristics. Furthermore, AM plays an important role during inflammation. Interestingly, AM secretion and AM receptor expression had also proven to be glucocorticoid (GC)-dependent in a variety of cell types, suggesting an intriguing relationship between the two compounds that needed to be further characterized. Protein studies have never been carried out in endothelial cells and neither have astrocytes been thoroughly investigated. Hence we studied the effect of GC treatments on AM secretion and AM-sensitivity in ECV304 an endothelial-like cell line and C6 rat astrocytes, focusing on receptor protein expression. We demonstrated that GCs could directly up-regulate RAMP2 expression intracellularly in endothelial cells. On the contrary, GCs were essential to maintain RAMP basal levels in astrocytes, where they could alter AM secretion within 24h. Although RAMP2 has shown to be similarly up-regulated also by AM exposure, no change in AM receptor expression was noted in C6 cells. In conclusion, our study indicates that GCs are able to regulate AM-sensitivity and AM secretion differently in endothelial-like cells and astrocytes. In particular, GCs altered RAMP2 in ECV304 cells, while affecting AM secretion in astrocytes, an interaction which could have interesting therapeutic implications for the blood–brain barrier regulation during both physiological and inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Although mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have demonstrated great therapeutic potential, the heterogeneity of MSCs may be responsible for the incongruent data obtained in MSC-based preclinical studies and clinical trials. Here, four mouse clonal MSC lines, termed MSC1, MSC2, MSC3, and MSC4, were isolated and extensively characterized. MSC4 cells grew most rapidly and formed colonies of the largest size, whereas MSC3 cells exhibited the slowest growth and formed only a few tiny clusters. MSC4 cells could differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes in vitro, and more importantly, establish hematopoietic microenvironment in vivo; whereas the other lines displayed uni-adipogenic, osteo-chondrogenic, or non-differentiation potential. All lines were positive for Sca-1, CD106, and CD44; MSC4 was also positive for CD90.2. In terms of immunosuppressive capacity, MSC2, MSC3, and MSC4 cells exerted clear inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation, whereas MSC1 did not. Further investigation revealed that the NO and not the PGE2 pathway may play a role in the different immunomodulatory effects of the cell lines. To clarify the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, we employed RNA sequencing to compare the gene expression profiles of the four subtypes, revealing a relationship between gene expression and variability in subtype function. This study provides novel information about the heterogeneity of MSCs and insight into the selection of optimal cell sources for therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Changes in extracellular pH are common events in both pathological conditions and during normal brain function. In organs other than the brain, cells may respond to pH changes by trafficking of acid–base transporters. However, regulation of neuronal acid–base transporters during pH shifts is not understood. The aim of this study was to investigate regulatory mechanisms of the variants of the electrogenic sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter 1, NBCe1-A and NBCe1-B/C, in neurons following changes of extracellular pH. Therefore, primary mouse hippocampal neurons were exposed to extracellular acidosis or alkalosis. We show that acid–base changes regulated trafficking and membrane expression of neuronal NBCe1 but the underlying molecular cues were distinct for individual NBCe1 variants. Following extracellular acidosis NBCe1-A was recruited from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane, followed by increased membrane expression, whereas NBCe1-B/C was retrieved from the membrane. Extracellular alkalosis had no impact on NBCe1-A, but caused translocation of NBCe1-B/C toward the dendrites. We also show that acidosis-induced NBCe1-A, but not NBCe1-B/C, trafficking is mediated by Rab8a. Rab8a is expressed in hippocampal neurons, co-localizes, and interacts with NBCe1-A. Loss-of-function of Rab8a using specific siRNA prevented acidosis-induced redistribution of NBCe1-A. These data propose opposite recruitment pattern for NBCe1 variants in neurons following extracellular acid–base changes, implicating distinct physiological functions of individual NBCe1 variants, and introduce Rab8a as a novel molecular determinant and crucial mediator of acidosis-induced NBCe1 trafficking in neurons.

Abstract: Water vapor ingress significantly impacts the performance and the long-term reliability of copper indium gallium selenide photovoltaic modules. A cost effective packaging method that can protect photovoltaic modules from the operating environment is critical to their widespread commercialization. Due to the sensitivity of both the copper indium gallium selenide cells and the electrodes to water vapor, they need an encapsulant with low water vapor permeation as well as side sealing materials, resulting in a high cost of manufacturing. Hence, a packaging strategy without sealing materials is proposed with new encapsulant materials. In this study, the overall amount of permeated water vapor through ionomer and polyvinyl butyral encapsulants was investigated and compared with widely used encapsulants such as ethylene vinyl acetate. The diffusion and solubility coefficients were calculated from the experimentally determined water vapor transmission rate in both transient and steady state transport regimes. To understand the permeation mechanism of water vapor through the encapsulant, the temperature dependence of the diffusion and solubility coefficients was investigated. Based on experimentally determined permeation properties, the amount of water vapor absorption and the ingress speed into the PV module under a continuously varying environment were investigated. Ethylene vinyl acetate shows its excellence among encapsulants, when simply considering ingress speed of water vapor (slower permeation), while ionomer dominantly outperforms other materials, when focusing on the total amount of water absorption (less permeation).

Abstract: The domain size of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is of great importance to the performance and lifetime of a device. This study focuses on the use of polystyrene-tethered fullerenes (PTFs) as an additive to reduce the initial domain size of PCBM as well as to mitigate the growth of these domains over time that typically results in decreased device efficiency. Films were prepared from a 1:1 mixture of P3HT:PCBM on silicon wafers to approximate a BHJ system. PTFs were added in concentrations ranging from 0 to 20%. The samples were then annealed at 150°C for varying times ranging from 5 to 60min and examined by SEM to determine the average PCBM domain sizes for each sample. As expected, the control sample containing no additive showed significant growth in the PCBM domains as the sample was annealed with a final average domain size of 290μm2. However, addition of as little as 5% PTFs produced average PCBM domain sizes after 60min of annealing of 28μm2. Addition of 20% PTF resulted in an average PCBM domain size of 2μm2. Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) studies were performed on the films to study their electrical properties and based on these encouraging results; devices containing these architectures were prepared. OPVs with PTFs showed an increased lifetime, and in some cases, an increase in efficiency over devices containing no PTF.

Abstract: Metabolic alteration in cancer cells is one of the most conspicuous characteristics that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. Many studies suggest that several underlying mechanisms lead to the Warburg effect (increased aerobic glycolysis) during cancer development. Here, we explored how oroxylin A affected the glycolytic metabolism in cancer cells and the underlying mechanism involved in this process. Our data revealed that both oroxylin A and adriamycin could inhibit lactate generation and glucose uptake in HepG2 cells at mild concentrations, without causing robust cell apoptosis. Oroxylin A has exerted little influence on the oxygen consumption, whereas adriamycin decreased oxygen consumption in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, oroxylin A could increase protein and mRNA expression of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) and synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2), which are the key metabolic modulators regulated by p53. Meanwhile adriamycin could increase protein and mRNA expression of TIGAR and SCO2, but decrease that of phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). Oroxylin A and adriamycin also modulated the stability and activity of p53 through inducing phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and suppressing the expression of MDM2. Furthermore, p53 siRNA and p53 inhibitor assay in wild-type p53 HepG2 cells both revealed the key role of p53 in oroxylin A and adriamycin-mediated glycolytic metabolism regulation. Transfecting wt p53 plasmid to p53-deficient H1299 cells could inverse some of the metabolic characteristics regulated by oroxylin A. This study revealed a new aspect of glucose metabolism regulation of oroxylin A, which may contribute to its new anticancer mechanism.

Abstract: Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins are known to play roles in the cellular response to DNA interstrand cross-linking lesions; however, several reports have suggested that FA proteins play additional roles. To elucidate novel functions of FA proteins, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify binding partners of the Fanconi anemia complementation group A (FANCA) protein. The candidate proteins included never-in-mitosis-gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 (Nek2), which functions in the maintenance of centrosome integrity. The interaction of FANCA and Nek2 was confirmed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. Furthermore, FANCA interacted with γ-tubulin and localized to centrosomes, most notably during the mitotic phase, confirming that FANCA is a centrosomal protein. Knockdown of FANCA increased the frequency of centrosomal abnormalities and enhanced the sensitivity of U2OS osteosarcoma cells to nocodazole, a microtubule-interfering agent. In vitro kinase assays indicated that Nek2 can phosphorylate FANCA at threonine-351 (T351), and analysis with a phospho-specific antibody confirmed that this phosphorylation occurred in response to nocodazole treatment. Furthermore, U2OS cells overexpressing the phosphorylation-defective T351A FANCA mutant showed numerical centrosomal abnormalities, aberrant mitotic arrest, and enhanced nocodazole sensitivity, implying that the Nek2-mediated T351 phosphorylation of FANCA is important for the maintenance of centrosomal integrity. Taken together, this study revealed that FANCA localizes to centrosomes and is required for the maintenance of centrosome integrity, possibly through its phosphorylation at T351 by Nek2.

Abstract: This work attempts to reveal the comparability issues related to outdoor testing procedures of organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules via studies of inter-laboratory long-term outdoor measurements of roll-to-roll coated flexible OPV modules (P3HT:PCBM, inverted architecture) in different geographic locations from both Southern and Northern hemispheres. The interpretation of the module degradation via sub-cell analyses is presented and the poor reproducibility of the module performance linked to the barrier properties of the encapsulation around the device terminals is addressed. We demonstrate that the modules' t80 lifetime may vary between a few hundred to over 10,000h depending on how well the device terminals are sealed. We additionally demonstrate up to 17 months of stable performance for sub-cells within the modules. Furthermore, the effects of different geographical locations, weather conditions and measurement setups on the comparability of test results are analyzed. A strong link between the device temperature and performance is revealed, which is ascribed to the reaction of PEDOT:PSS layer with water. The estimation of the true performance of the modules by accommodation of variations in testing conditions is performed. Based on the results a set of recommendations from the ISOS-O guiding protocols are highlighted, which can help remove the factors that affect the comparability of the test results.

Abstract: Protein arginylation mediated by arginyl-tRNA protein transferase is a post-translational modification that occurs widely in biology, it has been shown to regulate protein and properties and functions. Post-translational arginylation is critical for embryogenesis, cardiovascular development and angiogenesis but the molecular effects of proteins arginylated in vivo are largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that arginylation reduces CRT (calreticulin) thermostability and induces a greater degree of dimerization and oligomerization. R-CRT (arginylated calreticulin) forms disulfide-bridged dimers that are increased in low Ca2+ conditions at physiological temperatures, a similar condition to the cellular environment that it required for arginylation of CRT. Moreover, R-CRT self-oligomerizes through non-covalent interactions that are enhanced at temperatures above 40°C, condition that mimics the heat shock treatment where R-CRT is the only isoespecies of CRT that associates in cells to SGs (stress granules). We show that in cells lacking CRT the scaffolding of larger SGs is impaired; the transfection with CRT (hence R-CRT expression) restores SGs assembly whereas the transfection with CRT mutated in Cys146 does not. Thus, R-CRT disulfide-bridged dimers (through Cys146) are essential for the scaffolding of larger SGs under heat shock, although these dimers are not required for R-CRT association to SGs. The alteration in SGs assembly is critical for the normal cellular recover of cells after heat induced stress. We conclude that R-CRT is emerging as a novel protein that has an impact on the regulation of SGs scaffolding and cell survival.

Abstract: This work demonstrates hybrid InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency using colloidal CdS quantum dots (QDs) and back-side distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). CdS QDs can absorb ultraviolet (UV) photons, which are strongly absorbed by indium tin oxide (ITO), and they emit photons with a longer wavelength. This process improves the collection of photon-generated carriers and is known as the luminescence down-shifting (LDS). Accordingly, CdS QDs can compensate for the poor utilization of UV photons in an ITO layer, enhancing the external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the UV range. The DBRs on the back of the solar cells can reflect photons of longer wavelengths back into the absorber layer, increasing the EQE (380–440nm). The combination of CdS QDs and DBRs results in broadband EQE enhancement, and yields an overall power conversion efficiency that is 20.7% better than that of a reference device without CdS QDs and DBRs.

Abstract: The use of magnesium sulphate as a means for long term heat storage, offers a compact, clean, and cheap way of storing solar energy during the summer season, and due to its high energy storage density, is a superior candidate for chemical heat storage. The impregnation of MgSO4 in a highly porous host provides a variety of enhancements, particularly offering a large absorption surface area available for MgSO4 and H2O molecules. Four series of wide pore zeolite composite materials containing varying quantities of MgSO4 (from 5 to 15wt%) have been prepared and characterized. Heats of sorption/desorption cycles were recorded using thermogravimetry coupled to differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC). Zeolites Na–X, Mordenite and Y (Na and H) were selected, with the aim of impregnating the highest quantity of MgSO4, whilst achieving the highest heat release/store possible. Zeolites Na–Y and H–Y composites containing 15wt% MgSO4 achieved the highest heats of hydration (1090 and 867Jg−1 sample, respectively) compared to zeolite Na–X and Mordenite composites containing 15wt% MgSO4 (731 and 507Jg−1, respectively) and was attributed to the retention of the high surface area and pore volume of the host zeolite.

Abstract: Slot-die coating is one of the promising methods for fabricating large-area polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to its compatibility with roll-to-roll printing and one-dimensional direct patterning. In this study, we investigated correlations between conformal film morphology of intermixed poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) material and universal control factors such as shim length, substrate temperature, and coating speed. The observed correlation equation is better matched to the meniscus coating parameter equation rather than to the traditional high-viscosity extrusion slot-die coating parameter equation. Based on our findings regarding the governing factors of the thin film formation of bulk-heterojunction materials, we demonstrated the development of uniform large-area polymer solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.07% under Air Mass 1.5condition and the possibility of high-throughput production.

Abstract: The mechanisms leading to neuronal death during glucose deprivation have not been fully elucidated, but a role of oxidative stress has been suggested. In the present study we have investigated whether the production of reactive oxygen species during glucose deprivation, contributes to the activation of calpain, a calcium-dependent protease involved in neuronal injury associated with brain ischemia and cerebral trauma. We have observed a rapid activation of calpain, as monitored by the cleavage of the cytoskeletal protein α-spectrin, after glucose withdrawal, which is reduced by inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, phospholipase A2 and NADPH oxidase. Results suggest that phospholipase A2 and NADPH oxidase contribute to the early activation of calpain after glucose deprivation. In particular NOX2, a member of the NADPH oxidase family is involved, since reduced stimulation of calpain activity is observed after glucose deprivation in hippocampal slices from transgenic mice lacking a functional NOX2. We observed an additive effect of the inhibitors of xanthine oxidase and phospholipase A2 on both ROS production and calpain activity, suggesting a synergistic action of these two enzymes. The present results provide new evidence showing that reactive oxygen species stimulate calpain activation during glucose deprivation and that this mechanism is involved in neuronal death.

Abstract: Mitochondrial biogenesis and function are under the control of 17β-estradiol, which acts through two distinct estrogen receptors (alpha or beta), and the estrogen receptors ratio can determine the final effect of 17β-estradiol on mitochondria. Our aim was to study the effects of 17β-estradiol on mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and function in breast cancer cell lines with different estrogen receptors ratios. Mitochondrial biogenesis was increased in MDA-MB-231 (with only estrogen receptor beta expression), T47D (normal estrogen receptors ratio) and MCF-7 (highest estrogen receptors ratio) breast cancer cell lines, in response to different mitochondrial and cellular status. In fact, mitochondria of the MDA-MB-231 and T47D cell lines maintained their functionality, although, the MCF-7 cell line did suffer an important decrease in mitochondrial function. Thus, mitochondrial biogenesis increased in MCF-7 with the aim of mitigating these defective mitochondria. In normal conditions, mitophagic processes remove defective mitochondria to refresh the mitochondrial pool. Mitochondrial dynamics were also under control by 17β-estradiol, and showed modifications in the fusion/fission processes and the modulation of mitochondrial removal. In fact, cells with only estrogen receptor beta or with a low estrogen receptors ratio, such as MDA-MB-231 and T47D, showed an increase in fusion processes. However, the MCF-7 cell line, with more estrogen receptor alpha, also showed an increase in fusion processes, even though the fission processes were diminished and led to an accumulation of unfunctional mitochondria. Finally, the importance of estrogen receptor beta in mitochondrial biogenesis, function, as well as in mitochondrial dynamics was examined. Using the T47D-estrogen receptor beta tetracycline-inducible cell line, the results confirmed that when the overexpression of estrogen receptor beta was inhibited, there was an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, although these mitochondria were less functional, and with fewer fission events, although there was an increase in fusion processes.

Abstract: Cell-based therapies promise important developments for regenerative medicine purposes. Adipose tissue and the adipogenic process has become central to an increasing number of translational efforts in addition to plastic and reconstructive surgical applications. In recent experimental clinical trials, human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proven to be well tolerated because of their low immunoreactivity. MSC are multipotent cells found among mature cells in different tissues and organs with the potentiality to differentiate in many cell types, including osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes, thus being a suitable cell source for tissue engineering strategies. We compared the adipogenic potential of MSC originated from two adult sources as fat pads and bone marrow, and from four foetal sources as umbilical cord blood, Wharton's jelly, amniotic fluid and preterm umbilical cord perivascular cells. Surprisingly, adult MSC displayed higher differentiation capacities confirmed by gene expression analysis on a selected panel of adipogenesis-related genes. Further, an in-depth molecular analysis highlighted the early and vigorous activation of the PPARγ transcription factor-cascade in adipose-derived MSC that resulted to be both delayed and reduced in foetal MSC accounting for their lack of adipogenic potential. Thus, MSC show a different degree of phenotypic plasticity depending on the source tissue, that should be taken into consideration for the selection of the most appropriate MSC type for specific tissue regeneration purposes.

Abstract: The sequential and cyclic spray ion layer gas reaction (spray-ILGAR) technique allows the deposition of metal chalcogenide films controllable from monodispersed nanodots to homogeneous compact layer. With access to this technique, a structured buffer layer for Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 cells, named “defect passivation/point contact bilayer buffer” is introduced at the heterogeneous interfaces to replace the conventional toxic CdS buffeProd. Type: FTPr material and to improve the pure In2S3 buffer. Here, the spray-ILGAR ZnS nanodots serve as a passivation layer with a reduced interface recombination, while the compact spray-ILGAR In2S3 film on top and in-between the nanodots acts as point contact layer for the charge carrier transport. The optimal ZnS dot density and In2S3 thickness are determined and discussed in detail. As yet, the solar cell efficiency with ZnS/In2S3 buffer layer can be improved by about 1.5% absolutely as compared to a pure In2S3 buffered cell. Apart from the electronic properties of the absorber/buffer interface, also the chemical and diffusion processes during junction formation, which may influence the properties of the completed solar cell, are investigated and discussed.

Abstract: We report on the photovoltaic properties of inverted polymer solar cells (IPSCs) where the transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode was modified by a ZnO layer using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO) layers were deposited with varying thicknesses from 0 to 1500nm. The work function and surface morphology of ITO/i-ZnO were found to be dependent on the i-ZnO thickness. When the thickness of the i-ZnO layer was 80nm, optimized IPSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.93% was achieved. Furthermore, the i-ZnO layer doped with boron (BZO) was investigated. The best IPSC with a BZO layer showed a PCE of 3.26%, which is higher than that (2.93%) of the device with the i-ZnO layer. The better performance is due to combined effects of improvement in charge collection and conductivity of BZO/ITO electrode.

Abstract: RNA activation is a promising discovery that promoter-targeted double-stranded small RNAs, termed small activating RNAs (saRNAs), can induce gene expression, which represents a novel approach to gene over-expression without traditional vector-based systems. PAWR is a tumor suppressing gene essential for apoptosis and a cancer-selective target for cancer therapeutics. Here our study identified synthetic saRNAs that could activate the expression of PAWR in human cancer cells. Functional analysis of PAWR induction revealed that saRNA treatment induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of cancer cells, and predictably modulated the expression of known downstream target gene Bcl-2. New functional saRNAs can also be harvested by one or two-base shifting of the original target sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that activation of PAWR is accompanied by reduced dimethylation at histone H3K9 and increased dimethylation at histone H3K4. Moreover, the existence of transcripts in PAWR promoter was detected but its relationship with RNA activation needs more lucubration. These data have enlarged the gene pool of RNAa and hold great promise as an alternative for PAWR-targeted therapeutics.

Abstract: Background and objectives
Autophagy is a self-degradation mechanism induced under stress conditions in all eukaryotic cells. Its activity in human lymphomas has not been studied as yet.
Methods
In this study, the autophagic activity of lymphoid cells was investigated in follicular lymphomas (FL; 48 cases), diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL; 78 cases), and in reactive follicular hyperplasias (41 cases), using the light chain 3A (LC3A) antibody and a standard immunohistochemical technique.
Results
In all cases, the pattern of LC3A reactivity was uniformly diffuse cytoplasmic, but expressed more frequently in FLs (68.8%) than in DLBCLs (41%) (p=0.02), and much more commonly in DLBCLs than in reactive lymph nodes (24.3%) (p<0.006). Interestingly, FLs expressing LC3A in >10% of lymphoid cells (high reactivity) were associated with the hypoxia-related protein HIF1α and the enzyme of anaerobic metabolism lactate dehydrogenase LDH5 (p=0.004 and p=0.003, respectively). Such associations, however, were not a feature in DLBCLs of increased LC3A activity.
Conclusions
LC3A expression in FLs is hypoxia-induced, whereas its expression in DLBCLs may be regulated by other molecular mechanisms. The current study provides a tool for further assessment of autophagic activity in translational and autophagy targeting therapy studies.

Abstract: This study investigates how to apply space-charge-limited (SCL) current to describe shunt leakage current in a CIGS solar cell. Possible factors inducing SCL current have been observed through conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM), which supports the SCL current theory, describing the shunt current of a CIGS solar cell. In simulations derived from experimental data, deviation of dark IV curves is due to flaws in the real device. These flaws are absent in simulation, but investigation verifies the characteristics of SCL current component's experimental IV curves within shunt leakage current. A device with a metal/CIGS/metal structure could simulate SCL current and confirm its characteristics. Such a simulated structure, representing flaws inserted into a CIGS solar cell, generates the same dark-current behavior revealed in experimental dark IV curves. This study investigates the response of dark current to varying sizes of the flaw within the CIGS solar cell.

Abstract: Versatile electrowetting (EW) arrays were fabricated with small to large pixels, on fixed glass and flexible polymer substrates, for smart window applications. EW prototypes on glass substrates were constructed with pixel sizes ranging from 50μm×150μm to 2mm×2mm. The dosing of the array with colored oil was achieved by dip coating the substrate through an oil film suspended on a water bath. The arrays can be driven by either DC or AC voltage. Optical transmission of the prototypes can be modulated from ∼5% to >70% with a relatively low applied voltage of ∼15V. The switching speed of the prototype depends on oil properties and cell size, typically ∼10ms for 300μm×900μm pixel cells. Flexible color EW array prototypes have been fabricated on polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, which can be switched reversibly by applying a relatively low voltage difference between the water and bottom electrode. The EW specifications are maintained even when the prototype is mechanically flexed. These results indicate the promise of EW technology for smart window applications.

Abstract: A thin, flexible monocrystalline germanium (c-Ge) heterojunction solar cell has been developed based on a novel kerfless exfoliation process and remote plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The performance of the exfoliated 50μm thick and bulk 500μm Ge heterojunction cells is compared in this paper. A superior conversion efficiency of 5.28% was achieved with the 50μm exfoliated Ge cell versus 1.78% for the bulk Ge cell, in agreement with simulation results. A record fill factor of 58.1% for an a-Si:H/c-Ge heterojunction cell was obtained with the exfoliated cell. Moreover, the conversion efficiency achieved with the 50μm exfoliated cell (without intrinsic a-Si:H passivation) is comparable to the best reported in literature with bulk Ge heterojunction cells and intrinsic a-S:H passivation.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent progenitors that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the major factors of initiating and regulating angiogenesis. It has been reported that VEGF can induce MSCs differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs). However, the mechanism that VEGF-induced MSC differentiation is not completely understood. Here, we showed that VEGF induced human and rat bone marrow-derived MSCs differentiation to ECs. Rho family plays an important role in VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Our results indicated that in MSCs, VEGF activated Rho/ROCK signaling pathway and promoted nuclear translocation of myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A), which is controlled by Rho/ROCK signaling. In addition, Rho inhibitor C3 transferase, ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or depletion of endogenous MRTF-A abolished the VEGF-induced differentiation of MSCs into ECs. Furthermore, VEGF also enhanced the expression levels of CYR61/CCN1, as a regulator of vascular development and angiogenesis, and knockdown of endogenous MRTF-A reduced VEGF-induced the upregulation of CYR61/CCN1. Report assays with site-direct mutation analysis of CYR61/CCN1 promoter demonstrated that MRTF-A transactivated CYR61/CCN1 promoter mainly depending on CArG box. In this study, we identify the Rho/MRTF-A signaling pathway as a main actor in controlling VEGF-induced differentiation of human and rat bone marrow-derived MSCs into endothelial cells.

Abstract: In organic wrap through solar cells the current which is collected by poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) at the illuminated front side is transferred through vias which are distributed over the cell to another metal layer on the backside. They feature a low area loss and the possibility of broad cell stripes in modules. A combined optical and electrical model is applied on organic wrap through solar cells to optimize the layout. Calculating the absorption by the transfer matrix formalism allows to identify the optimum layer thickness for the PEDOT:PSS which depends on the transparency and the conductivity. The efficiency turns out to be robust regarding layer thickness variations close to the optimum at a layer thickness of 200nm for the PEDOT:PSS. The via diameter has to be chosen as small as possible for the best performance and the parasitic resistances caused by the PEDOT:PSS and the vias mainly determine the optimum distance between the vias. It is furthermore possible to use the model to estimate the series resistance of the vias and the series resistance which can be attributed to the transport through the photoactive layer and its interfaces which is helpful for further device optimization. Wrap through solar cells on plastic substrates were manufactured with a maximum efficiency of 2.8% on a cell area of 2.25cm2. The investigations revealed that there is further optimization potential by optimizing the processing of the active layer.

Abstract: Abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Iron is also believed to serve as a major contributor by inducing oxidative stress and α-syn aggregation. Here, we report that down-regulation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) may contribute to iron-induced α-syn aggregation. In this study, we show that ferrous iron down-regulates Nrf2 and HO-1 in a time-dependent manner in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Levels of both Nrf2 and HO-1 are decreased even more by ferrous iron in SK-N-SH cells that overexpress α-syn and results in greater cell toxicity. Consistent with these results, knockdown of α-syn expression prevents reduction of Nrf2 and HO-1 by ferrous iron, eliminates α-syn aggregates, and protects SK-N-SH cells against ferrous iron-induced cell damage. Furthermore, increased HO-1 expression exerts a protective role against ferrous iron. These results support a new hypothesis of synergistic α-syn/iron cytotoxicity, whereby ferrous iron induces α-syn aggregation and neurotoxicity by inhibiting Nrf2/HO-1. Inhibition of Nrf2/HO-1 leads to more α-syn aggregation and greater toxicity induced by iron, creating a vicious cycle of iron accumulation, α-syn aggregation and HO-1 disruption in PD.

Abstract: Human cysteine cathepsins (Cats) are implicated in lung injuries and tissue remodeling and have recently emerged as important players in pulmonary inflammations. The proteolytic activities of Cat B, L, K, S and H are dramatically increased in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), suggesting a possible involvement in the CF pathophysiology. We found that pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) that participates to innate host defense is extensively degraded in CF expectorations. Breakdown of SP-A was markedly decreased in CF sputum by E-64 and Mu-Leu-Hph-VSPh, a Cat S inhibitor. Cat S cleaved efficiently and specifically SP-A within critical residues of the solvent-exposed loop of its carbohydrate recognition (C-type lectin) domain that allows binding to pathogens. Cat S decreased aggregation properties of SP-A (self-aggregation, aggregation of phospholipid vesicles and rough LPS). Moreover cleavage of SP-A by Cat S reduced binding to yeast mannan and impaired agglutination of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a foremost detrimental pathogen colonizing the lungs of CF patients. Besides human neutrophil serine proteases and bacterial proteases, we propose that Cat S may participate in the pathophysiology of CF by weakening the antibacterial activity of SP-A. More broadly, present results provide further indication that Cat S, along with Cats B and L, could display immuno-modulatory functions by inactivating key proteins involved in the innate immunity defense.

Abstract: Reflected light from textured front surfaces of a solar cell contains useful information about the surface geometry as well as the optical properties of the cell. In this study, the 2-D reflected light distributions from front surfaces of silicon cells textured in various ways are characterised by an appropriate optical setup. The results are compared to those of conventional ray tracing. For surfaces with regular inverted pyramids, we identified reflected light diffraction patterns that can be explained by the principles of geometrical optics. These reflected light patterns can be used to extract details of surface morphologies and hence be used as a tool to fine tune and monitor fabrication processes. Surfaces with random pyramids reflect light without diffraction patterns but with other distinctive features. Their reflections lie primarily in the angular range between 0° and 50°, with a maximum intensity at about 25°. The impact of the encapsulant's refractive index on the amount of total internal reflection is discussed for various types of textured surface. For both random and regularly textured surfaces, it appears possible to achieve higher total internal reflection ratio when the encapsulant's index increases from conventional 1.5 to 1.6.
