Abstract: Summary
The integrated stress response (ISR) is a key cellular signaling pathway activated by environmental alterations that represses protein synthesis to restore homeostasis. To prevent sustained damage, the ISR is counteracted by the upregulation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 34 (GADD34), a stress-induced regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 that mediates translation reactivation and stress recovery. Here, we uncover a novel ISR regulatory mechanism that post-transcriptionally controls the stability of PPP1R15A mRNA encoding GADD34. We establish that the 3′ untranslated region of PPP1R15A mRNA contains an active AU-rich element (ARE) recognized by proteins of the ZFP36 family, promoting its rapid decay under normal conditions and stabilization for efficient expression of GADD34 in response to stress. We identify the tight temporal control of PPP1R15A mRNA turnover as a component of the transient ISR memory, which sets the threshold for cellular responsiveness and mediates adaptation to repeated stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Small GTPases of the Ras subfamily are best known for their role as proto-oncoproteins, while their function during microbial infection has remained elusive. Here, we show that Legionella pneumophila hijacks the small GTPase NRas to the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) surface. A CRISPR interference screen identifies a single L. pneumophila effector, DenR (Lpg1909), required for this process. Recruitment is specific for NRas, while its homologs KRas and HRas are excluded from LCVs. The C-terminal hypervariable tail of NRas is sufficient for recruitment, and interference with either NRas farnesylation or S-acylation sites abrogates recruitment. Intriguingly, we detect markers of active NRas signaling on the LCV, suggesting it acts as a signaling platform. Subsequent phosphoproteomics analyses show that DenR rewires the host NRas signaling landscape, including dampening of the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These results provide evidence for L. pneumophila targeting NRas and suggest a link between NRas GTPase signaling and microbial infection.

Abstract: Objective
Heterotopic ossification (HO), also known as ossifying myositis, is a condition that produces abnormal bone and cartilage tissue in the soft tissues. Hypoxia inducible factor lα (HIF-lα) regulates the expression of various genes, which is closely related to the promotion of bone formation, and Drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein (SMAD) mediates the signal transduction in the Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which affects the function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and thus plays a key role in the regulation of bone remodeling. We aimed to investigate the mechanism by which HIF-1α induces osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in a hypoxic environment.
Methods
A cellular hypoxia model was constructed to verify the expression of HIF-1α, while alizarin red staining was performed to observe the osteogenic differentiation ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Alizarin red staining was used to analyze the late mineralization ability of the cells. Western blot analysis was performed to analyze the expression levels of osteogenesis-related factors OCN, OPN proteins as well as the pathway proteins BMP4, p-Smad1/5/8, and Smad1. We also constructed a rat model of ectopic bone formation, observed ectopic ossification by X-ray, and verified the success of the rat model by ELISA of HIF-1α. HE staining was used to observe the matrix and trabecular structure of bone, and Masson staining was used to observe the collagen and trabecular structure of bone. Immunohistochemistry analyzed the expression of OCN and OPN in ectopic bone tissues, and WB analyzed the expression of pathway proteins BMP4, p-Smad1/5/8 and Smad1 in ectopic bone tissues to verify the signaling pathway of ectopic bone formation.
Results
Our results indicate that hypoxic environment upregulates HIF-1a expression and activates BMP4/SMAD signaling pathway. This led to an increase in ALP content and enhanced expression of the osteogenesis-related factors OCN and OPN, resulting in enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The results of our in vivo experiments showed that rats inoculated with BMSCs overexpressing HIF-1α showed bony structures in tendon tissues, enhanced expression of the bone signaling pathways BMP4 and p-Smad1/5/8, and enhanced expression levels of the osteogenic-related factors OCN and OPN, resulting in the formation of ectopic bone.
Conclusions
These data further suggest a novel mechanistic view that hypoxic bone marrow BMSCs activate the BMP4/SMAD pathway by up-regulating the expression level of HIF-1α, thereby promoting the secretion of osteogenic factors leading to ectopic bone formation.

Abstract: Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) in plants is activated upon recognition by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) of Damage- and Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs and MAMPs) from plants or microorganisms, respectively. An increasing number of identified DAMPs/MAMPs are carbohydrates from plant cell walls and microbial extracellular layers, which are perceived by plant PRRs, such as LysM and Leucine Rich Repeat-Malectin (LRR-MAL) receptor kinases (RKs). LysM-RKs (e.g. CERK1, LYK4 and LYK5) are needed for recognition of fungal MAMP chitohexaose (β-1,4-D-(GlcNAc)6, CHI6), whereas IGP1/CORK1, IGP3 and IGP4 LRR-MAL RKs are required for perception of β-glucans, like cellotriose (β-1,4-D-(Glc)3, CEL3) and mixed-linked glucans. We have explored the diversity of carbohydrates perceived by Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings by determining PTI responses upon treatment with different oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. These analyses revealed that plant oligosaccharides from xylans [β-1,4-D-(xylose)4 (XYL4)], glucuronoxylans and α-1,4-glucans, and polysaccharides from plants and seaweeds activate PTI. Cross-elicitation experiments of XYL4 with other glycans showed that the mechanism of recognition of XYL4 and the DAMP 33-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-xylotetraose (XA3XX) shares some features with that of CEL3 but differs from that of CHI6. Notably, XYL4 and XA3XX perception is impaired in igp1/cork1, igp3 and igp4 mutants, and almost not affected in cerk1 lyk4 lyk5 triple mutant. XYL4 perception is conserved in different plant species since XYL4 pre-treatment triggers enhanced disease resistance in tomato to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and PTI responses in wheat. These results expand the number of glycans triggering plant immunity and support IGP1/CORK1, IGP3 and IGP4 relevance in Arabidopsis thaliana glycans perception and PTI activation.
Significance Statement
The characterization of plant immune mechanisms involved in the perception of carbohydrate-based structures recognized as DAMPs/MAMPs is needed to further understand plant disease resistance modulation. We show here that IGP1/CORK1, IGP3 and IGP4 LRR-MAL RKs are required for the perception of carbohydrate-based DAMPs β-1,4-D-(xylose)4 (XYL4) and 33-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-xylotetraose (XA3XX), further expanding the function of these LRR-MAL RKs in plant glycan perception and immune activation.

Abstract: Summary
The motivation to eat is suppressed by satiety and aversive stimuli such as nausea. The neural circuit mechanisms of appetite suppression by nausea are not well understood. Pkcδ neurons in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CeA) suppress feeding in response to satiety signals and nausea. Here, we characterized neurons enriched in the medial subdivision (CeM) of the CeA marked by expression of Dlk1. CeADlk1 neurons are activated by nausea, but not satiety, and specifically suppress feeding induced by nausea. Artificial activation of CeADlk1 neurons suppresses drinking and social interactions, suggesting a broader function in attenuating motivational behavior. CeADlk1 neurons form projections to many brain regions and exert their anorexigenic activity by inhibition of neurons of the parabrachial nucleus. CeADlk1 neurons are inhibited by appetitive CeA neurons, but also receive long-range monosynaptic inputs from multiple brain regions. Our results illustrate a CeA circuit that regulates nausea-induced feeding suppression.

Abstract: Summary
In the CA1 hippocampus, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing interneurons (VIP-INs) play a prominent role in disinhibitory circuit motifs. However, the specific behavioral conditions that lead to circuit disinhibition remain uncertain. To investigate the behavioral relevance of VIP-IN activity, we employed wireless technologies allowing us to monitor and manipulate their function in freely behaving mice. Our findings reveal that, during spatial exploration in new environments, VIP-INs in the CA1 hippocampal region become highly active, facilitating the rapid encoding of novel spatial information. Remarkably, both VIP-INs and pyramidal neurons (PNs) exhibit increased activity when encountering novel changes in the environment, including context- and object-related alterations. Concurrently, somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory populations show an inverse relationship with VIP-IN and PN activity, revealing circuit disinhibition that occurs on a timescale of seconds. Thus, VIP-IN-mediated disinhibition may constitute a crucial element in the rapid encoding of novelty and the acquisition of recognition memory.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria consist of hundreds of proteins, most of which are inaccessible to the proteasomal quality control system of the cytosol. How cells stabilize the mitochondrial proteome during challenging conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mitochondria form spatially defined protein aggregates as a stress-protecting mechanism. Two different types of intramitochondrial protein aggregates can be distinguished. The mitoribosomal protein Var1 (uS3m) undergoes a stress-induced transition from a soluble, chaperone-stabilized protein that is prevalent under benign conditions to an insoluble, aggregated form upon acute stress. The formation of Var1 bodies stabilizes mitochondrial proteostasis, presumably by sequestration of aggregation-prone proteins. The AAA chaperone Hsp78 is part of a second type of intramitochondrial aggregate that transiently sequesters proteins and promotes their folding or Pim1-mediated degradation. Thus, mitochondrial proteins actively control the formation of distinct types of intramitochondrial protein aggregates, which cooperate to stabilize the mitochondrial proteome during proteotoxic stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular morphology affects many aspects of cellular and organismal physiology. This makes it challenging to dissect the evolutionary basis for specific morphologies since various cellular functions may exert competing selective pressures on this trait, and the influence of these pressures will depend on the specific mechanisms of morphogenesis. In this light, we combined experiment and theory to investigate the complex basis for morphological diversity among tip-growing cells from across the tree of life. We discovered that an instability in the widespread mechanism of “inflationary” tip growth leads directly to a bifurcation in the common fitness landscape of tip-growing cells, which imposes a strict global constraint on their morphologies. This result rationalizes the morphology of an enormous diversity of important fungal, plant, protistan, and bacterial systems. More broadly, our study elucidates the principle that strong evolutionary constraints on complex traits, like biological form, may emerge from emergent instabilities within developmental systems.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming to pluripotency is associated with DNA damage and requires the functions of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor. Here, we leverage separation-of-function mutations in BRCA1/2 as well as the physical and/or genetic interactions between BRCA1 and its associated repair proteins to ascertain the relevance of homology-directed repair (HDR), stalled fork protection (SFP), and replication gap suppression (RGS) in somatic cell reprogramming. Surprisingly, loss of SFP and RGS is inconsequential for the transition to pluripotency. In contrast, cells deficient in HDR, but proficient in SFP and RGS, reprogram with reduced efficiency. Conversely, the restoration of HDR function through inactivation of 53bp1 rescues reprogramming in Brca1-deficient cells, and 53bp1 loss leads to elevated HDR and enhanced reprogramming in mouse and human cells. These results demonstrate that somatic cell reprogramming is especially dependent on repair of replication-associated double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the HDR activity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and can be improved in the absence of 53BP1.

Abstract: Summary
Trichoderma spp. have evolved the capacity to communicate with plants by producing various secondary metabolites (SMs). Nonhormonal SMs play important roles in plant root development, while specific SMs from rhizosphere microbes and their underlying mechanisms to control plant root branching are still largely unknown. In this study, a compound, anthranilic acid (2-AA), is identified from T. guizhouense NJAU4742 to promote lateral root development. Further studies demonstrate that 2-AA positively regulates auxin signaling and transport in the canonical auxin pathway. 2-AA also partly rescues the lateral root numbers of CASP1pro:shy2-2, which regulates endodermal cell wall remodeling via an RBOHF-induced reactive oxygen species burst. In addition, our work reports another role for microbial 2-AA in the regulation of lateral root development, which is different from its better-known role in plant indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis. In summary, this study identifies 2-AA from T. guizhouense NJAU4742, which plays versatile roles in regulating plant root development.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus causes the majority of skin and soft tissue infections, but this pathogen only transiently colonizes healthy skin. However, this transient skin exposure enables S. aureus to transition to infection. The initial adhesion of S. aureus to skin corneocytes is mediated by surface protein G (SasG). Here, phylogenetic analyses reveal the presence of two major divergent SasG alleles in S. aureus: SasG-I and SasG-II. Structural analyses of SasG-II identify a nonaromatic arginine in the binding pocket of the lectin subdomain that mediates adhesion to corneocytes. Atomic force microscopy and corneocyte adhesion assays indicate that SasG-II can bind to a broader variety of ligands than SasG-I. Glycosidase treatment results in different binding profiles between SasG-I and SasG-II on skin cells. In addition, SasG-mediated adhesion is recapitulated using differentiated N/TERT keratinocytes. Our findings indicate that SasG-II has evolved to adhere to multiple ligands, conferring a distinct advantage to S. aureus during skin colonization.

Abstract: Summary
N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) critically regulates RNA dynamics in various biological processes. The m6A demethylase ALKBH5 promotes tumorigenesis of glioblastoma, while the intricate web that orchestrates its regulation remains enigmatic. Here, we discover that cell density affects ALKBH5 subcellular localization and m6A dynamics. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 is phosphorylated by the large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2), preventing its nuclear export and enhancing protein stability. Furthermore, phosphorylated ALKBH5 reciprocally erases m6A from LATS2 mRNA, thereby stabilizing this transcript. Unexpectedly, LATS2 depletion suppresses glioblastoma stem cell self-renewal independent of yes-associated protein activation. Additionally, deficiency in either LATS2 or ALKBH5 phosphorylation impedes tumor progression in mouse xenograft models. Moreover, high levels of LATS2 expression and ALKBH5 phosphorylation are associated with tumor malignancy in patients with gliomas. Collectively, our study unveils an oncogenic positive feedback loop between LATS2 and ALKBH5, revealing a non-canonical branch of the Hippo pathway for RNA processing and suggesting potential anti-cancer interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Progenitor cells adapt their behavior in response to tissue demands. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling esophageal progenitor decisions remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a Troy (Tnfrsf19)-expressing progenitor subpopulation localized to defined regions along the mouse esophageal axis. Lineage tracing and mathematical modeling demonstrate that Troy-positive progenitor cells are prone to undergoing symmetrical fate choices and contribute to esophageal tissue homeostasis long term. Functionally, TROY inhibits progenitor proliferation and enables commitment to differentiation without affecting fate symmetry. Whereas Troy expression is stable during esophageal homeostasis, progenitor cells downregulate Troy in response to tissue stress, enabling proliferative expansion of basal cells refractory to differentiation and reestablishment of tissue homeostasis. Our results demonstrate functional, spatially restricted progenitor heterogeneity in the esophageal epithelium and identify how dynamic regulation of Troy coordinates tissue generation.

Abstract: Summary
UBE2F, a neddylation E2, neddylates CUL5 to activate cullin-RING ligase-5, upon coupling with neddylation E3 RBX2/SAG. Whether and how UBE2F controls pancreatic tumorigenesis is previously unknown. Here, we showed that UBE2F is essential for the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells with KRAS mutation. In the mouse KrasG12D pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) model, Ube2f deletion suppresses cerulein-induced pancreatitis, and progression of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Mechanistically, Ube2f deletion inactivates the Mapk-c-Myc signals via blocking ubiquitylation of Diras2, a substrate of CRL5Asb11 E3 ligase. Biologically, DIRAS2 suppresses growth and survival of human pancreatic cancer cells harboring mutant KRAS, and Diras2 deletion largely rescues the phenotypes induced by Ube2f deletion. Collectively, Ube2f or Diras2 plays a tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive role in the mouse KrasG12D PDAC model, respectively. The UBE2F-CRL5ASB11 axis could serve as a valid target for pancreatic cancer, whereas the levels of UBE2F or DIRAS2 may serve as prognostic biomarkers for PDAC patients.

Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial reproductive, endocrine and metabolic disturbance which is very commonly observed in females of reproductive age group. The disease is still incurable however the use of synthetic drugs in combination with lifestyle is recommended. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to investigate the possible beneficial effects of sitagliptin on PCOS induced rats on control diet (CD)/high fat- high fructose diet (HFFD). PCOS was induced by giving testosterone propionate (TP) for 28 days to both the CD/HFFD rats and treated with STG i.p. for last 15 days. At the end of the experiment lipid profile, inflammatory markers, expression of NF-κB-p65, miR-24 and miR-29a, fibrotic and apoptotic proteins from ovary tissue were examined. Moreover, lipid accumulation and fibrosis of ovary tissue was further confirmed using Sudan III and Masson’s trichrome stain. STG treated rats exerted a significant decrease in levels of cholesterol, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, IL-6 and TNF-α and increased HDL-C level, miR-24 and miR-29a expression. STG treated groups expressed significantly decreased expression of NF-κB-p65, TGF-β1, p-Smad 2 and p-Smad 3 followed by no significant changes in the expression of BAX, caspase-9, caspase-3 and Bcl-2 in all the PCOS induced groups. Among all the CD/ HFFD fed groups, rats on HFFD showed more devastating effect which suggests that diet plays a major role in genesis of PCOS. In conclusion, current results reflect the potential impact of STG against dyslipidaemia, inflammation and fibrosis in PCOS rats via regulating dyslipidaemia and fibrosis via DPP 4 mediated miR-29a expression.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleus is composed of functionally distinct membraneless compartments that undergo phase separation (PS). However, whether different subnuclear compartments are connected remains elusive. We identified a type of nuclear body with PS features composed of BAZ2A that associates with active chromatin. BAZ2A bodies depend on RNA transcription and BAZ2A non-disordered RNA-binding TAM domain. Although BAZ2A and H3K27me3 occupancies anticorrelate in the linear genome, in the nuclear space, BAZ2A bodies contact H3K27me3 bodies. BAZ2A-body disruption promotes BAZ2A invasion into H3K27me3 domains, causing H3K27me3-body loss and gene upregulation. Weak BAZ2A-RNA interactions, such as with nascent transcripts, promote BAZ2A bodies, whereas the strong binder long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Malat1 impairs them while mediating BAZ2A association to chromatin at nuclear speckles. In addition to unraveling a direct connection between nuclear active and repressive compartments through PS mechanisms, the results also showed that the strength of RNA-protein interactions regulates this process, contributing to nuclear organization and the regulation of chromatin and gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer therapy but only works in a subset of patients due to the insufficient infiltration, persistent exhaustion, and inactivation of T cells within a tumor. Herein, we develop an engineered probiotic (interleukin [IL]-12 nanoparticle Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 [INP-EcN]) acting as a living drug factory to biosynthesize anti-PD-1 and release IL-12 for initiating systemic antitumor immunity through T cell cascade regulation. Mechanistically, INP-EcN not only continuously biosynthesizes anti-PD-1 for relieving immunosuppression but also effectively cascade promote T cell activation, proliferation, and infiltration via responsive release of IL-12, thus reaching a sufficient activation threshold to ICB. Tumor targeting and colonization of INP-EcNs dramatically increase local drug accumulations, significantly inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis compared to commercial inhibitors. Furthermore, immune profiling reveals that anti-PD-1/IL-12 efficiently cascade promote antitumor effects in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner, clarifying the immune interaction of ICB and cytokine activation. Ultimately, such engineered probiotics achieve a potential paradigm shift from T cell exhaustion to activation and show considerable promise for antitumor bio-immunotherapy.

Abstract: The RNA-binding protein LUC7L3 is the human homolog of yeast U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-related splicing factor Luc7p. While the primary function of LUC7L3 as an RNA-binding protein is believed to be involved in RNA metabolism, particularly in the splicing process, its exact role and other functions are still not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of LUC7L3 and its impact on cell proliferation. Our study revealed that LUC7L3 depletion impairs cell proliferation compared to the other Luc7p paralogs, resulting in cell apoptosis and senescence. We explored the underlying mechanisms and found that LUC7L3 depletion leads to R-loop accumulation, DNA replication stress, and genome instability. Furthermore, we discovered that LUC7L3 depletion caused abnormalities in spindle assembly, leading to the formation of multinuclear cells. This was attributed to the dysregulation of protein translation of spindle-associated proteins. Additionally, we investigated the interplay between LUC7L3 and SRSF1 and identified SRSF1 as an upper stream regulator of LUC7L3, promoting the translation of LUC7L3 protein. These findings highlight the importance of LUC7L3 in maintaining genome stability and its relationship with SRSF1 in this regulatory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Attachment of circulating tumor cells to the endothelial cells (ECs) lining blood vessels is a critical step in cancer metastatic colonization, which leads to metastatic outgrowth. Breast and prostate cancers are common malignancies in women and men, respectively. Here, we observe that β1-integrin is required for human prostate and breast cancer cell adhesion to ECs under shear-stress conditions in vitro and to lung blood vessel ECs in vivo. We identify IQGAP1 and neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (NWASP) as regulators of β1-integrin transcription and protein expression in prostate and breast cancer cells. IQGAP1 and NWASP depletion in cancer cells decreases adhesion to ECs in vitro and retention in the lung vasculature and metastatic lung nodule formation in vivo. Mechanistically, NWASP and IQGAP1 act downstream of Cdc42 to increase β1-integrin expression both via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/focal adhesion kinase signaling at the protein level and by myocardin-related transcription factor/serum response factor (SRF) transcriptionally. Our results identify IQGAP1 and NWASP as potential therapeutic targets to reduce early metastatic dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
The retina is exquisitely patterned, with neuronal somata positioned at regular intervals to completely sample the visual field. Here, we show that phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) controls starburst amacrine cell spacing by modulating vesicular trafficking of cell adhesion molecules and Wnt proteins. Single-cell transcriptomics and double-mutant analyses revealed that Pten and Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule Dscam) are co-expressed and function additively to pattern starburst amacrine cell mosaics. Mechanistically, Pten loss accelerates the endocytic trafficking of DSCAM, FAT3, and MEGF10 off the cell membrane and into endocytic vesicles in amacrine cells. Accordingly, the vesicular proteome, a molecular signature of the cell of origin, is enriched in exocytosis, vesicle-mediated transport, and receptor internalization proteins in Pten conditional knockout (PtencKO) retinas. Wnt signaling molecules are also enriched in PtencKO retinal vesicles, and the genetic or pharmacological disruption of Wnt signaling phenocopies amacrine cell patterning defects. Pten thus controls vesicular trafficking of cell adhesion and signaling molecules to establish retinal amacrine cell mosaics.

Abstract: Summary
The posttranslational modification of proteins critically influences many biological processes and is a key mechanism that regulates the function of the RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR), a hub in liver cancer. Here, we show that HuR is SUMOylated in the tumor sections of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in contrast to the surrounding tissue, as well as in human cell line and mouse models of the disease. SUMOylation of HuR promotes major cancer hallmarks, namely proliferation and invasion, whereas the absence of HuR SUMOylation results in a senescent phenotype with dysfunctional mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Mechanistically, SUMOylation induces a structural rearrangement of the RNA recognition motifs that modulates HuR binding affinity to its target RNAs, further modifying the transcriptomic profile toward hepatic tumor progression. Overall, SUMOylation constitutes a mechanism of HuR regulation that could be potentially exploited as a therapeutic strategy for liver cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Corticospinal neurons (CSNs) synapse directly on spinal neurons, a diverse assortment of cells with unique structural and functional properties necessary for body movements. CSNs modulating forelimb behavior fractionate into caudal forelimb area (CFA) and rostral forelimb area (RFA) motor cortical populations. Despite their prominence, the full diversity of spinal neurons targeted by CFA and RFA CSNs is uncharted. Here, we use anatomical and RNA sequencing methods to show that CSNs synapse onto a remarkably selective group of spinal cell types, favoring inhibitory populations that regulate motoneuron activity and gate sensory feedback. CFA and RFA CSNs target similar spinal neuron types, with notable exceptions that suggest that these populations differ in how they influence behavior. Finally, axon collaterals of CFA and RFA CSNs target similar brain regions yet receive highly divergent inputs. These results detail the rules of CSN connectivity throughout the brain and spinal cord for two regions critical for forelimb behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The planar cell polarity (PCP) complex is speculated to function in murine lung development, where branching morphogenesis generates an epithelial tree whose distal tips expand dramatically during sacculation. Here, we show that PCP is dispensable in the airway epithelium for sacculation. Rather, we find a Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme: loss of Vangl1/2 inhibits mesenchymal thinning and expansion of the saccular epithelium. Further, loss of mesenchymal Wnt5a mimics sacculation defects observed in Vangl2-mutant lungs, implicating mesenchymal Wnt5a/Vangl signaling as a key regulator of late lung morphogenesis. A computational model predicts that sacculation requires a fluid mesenchymal compartment. Lineage-tracing and cell-shape analyses are consistent with the mesenchyme acting as a fluid tissue, suggesting that loss of Vangl1/2 impacts the ability of mesenchymal cells to exchange neighbors. Our data thus identify an explicit function for Vangl and the pulmonary mesenchyme in actively shaping the saccular epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Precise regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation is vital for organ morphology. Rice palea, serving as sepal, comprises two distinct regions: the marginal region (MRP) and body of palea (BOP), housing heterogeneous cell populations, which makes it an ideal system for studying organ morphogenesis. We report that the transcription factor (TF) REP1 promotes epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation in the BOP, resulting in hard silicified protrusion cells, by regulating the cyclin-dependent kinase gene, OsCDKB1;1. Conversely, TFs OsMADS6 and OsMADS32 are expressed exclusively in the MRP, where they limit cell division rates by inhibiting OsCDKB2;1 expression and promote endoreduplication, yielding elongated epidermal cells. Furthermore, reciprocal inhibition between the OsMADS6-OsMADS32 complex and REP1 fine-tunes the balance between cell division and differentiation during palea morphogenesis. We further show the functional conservation of these organ identity genes in heterogeneous cell growth in Arabidopsis, emphasizing a critical framework for controlling cellular heterogeneity in organ morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
In the brain, the role of matrilin-3, an extracellular matrix component in cartilage, is unknown. Here, we identify that matrilin-3 decreased in reactive astrocytes but was unchanged in neurons after ischemic stroke in animals. Importantly, it declined in serum of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition or supplementation of matrilin-3 aggravates or reduces brain injury, astrocytic cell death, and glial scar, respectively, but has no direct effect on neuronal cell death. RNA sequencing demonstrates that Matn3−/− mice display an increased inflammatory response profile in the ischemic brain, including the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Both endogenous and exogenous matrilin-3 reduce inflammatory mediators. Mechanistically, extracellular matrilin-3 enters astrocytes via caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis. Cytoplasmic matrilin-3 translocates into the nucleus by binding to NF-κB p65, suppressing inflammatory cytokine transcription. Extracellular matrilin-3 binds to BMP-2, blocking the BMP-2/Smads pathway. Thus, matrilin-3 is required for astrocytes to exert neuroprotection, at least partially, by suppressing astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation.

Abstract: The basal and glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells is a tightly regulated process that is triggered in a Ca2+-dependent fashion and further positively modulated by substances that raise intracellular levels of adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or by certain antidiabetic drugs. In a previous study, we have temporally resolved the subplasmalemmal [Ca2+]i dynamics in beta cells that are characterized by trains of sharply delimited spikes, reaching peak values up to 5 µM. Applying total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and synaptopHluorin to visualize fusion events of individual granules, we found that several fusion events can coincide within 50 to 150 ms. To test whether subplasmalemmal [Ca2+]i microdomains around single or clustered Ca2+ channels may cause a synchronized release of insulin-containing vesicles, we applied simultaneous dual-color TIRF microscopy and monitored Ca2+ fluctuations and exocytotic events in INS-1 cells at high frame rates. The results indicate that fusions can be triggered by subplasmalemmal Ca2+ spiking. This, however, does account for a minority of fusion events. About 90 %-95 % of fusion events either happen between Ca2+ spikes or incidentally overlap with subplasmalemmal Ca2+ spikes. We conclude that only a fraction of exocytotic events in glucose-induced and tolbutamide- or forskolin-enhanced insulin release from INS-1 cells is tightly coupled to Ca2+ microdomains around voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

Abstract: Summary
Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are now showing promising predictive performance on a wide variety of complex traits and diseases, but there exists a substantial performance gap across populations. We propose MUSSEL, a method for ancestry-specific polygenic prediction that borrows information in summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) across multiple ancestry groups via Bayesian hierarchical modeling and ensemble learning. In our simulation studies and data analyses across four distinct studies, totaling 5.7 million participants with a substantial ancestral diversity, MUSSEL shows promising performance compared to alternatives. For example, MUSSEL has an average gain in prediction R2 across 11 continuous traits of 40.2% and 49.3% compared to PRS-CSx and CT-SLEB, respectively, in the African ancestry population. The best-performing method, however, varies by GWAS sample size, target ancestry, trait architecture, and linkage disequilibrium reference samples; thus, ultimately a combination of methods may be needed to generate the most robust PRSs across diverse populations.

Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic dysfunction. This study aims to compare the oral and local treatments of metformin or its nanoparticles (NPs11) for ameliorating PCOS in rats. Rats were divided into 4 groups: the control group with no drug treatment; the PCOS group, where subcutaneous testosterone was given (10 mg/kg/day) for 28 days; the MET group, where metformin was administered orally or locally; and the NP group, where metformin NPs11 were also administered orally or locally. Oral administrations were for 21 days, while local injection was performed once surgically. After 7 weeks, all rats were sacrificed; blood glucose and serum hormonal levels and lipid profile were estimated, and the ovaries were assessed by histopathological, Ki-67 immunohistochemical, and histomorphometric evaluations. Blood glucose levels were significantly decreased in groups of orally administered metformin or NPs11 only, while the most efficient option for modulating PCOS-induced hormonal and lipid profile changes was intraovarian injection of NPs11. The ovaries of PCOS rats demonstrated large follicular cysts, massive collagen depositions, and attenuated Ki-67 immunoexpression. Also, the PCOS group revealed a significant decrease in the count of all stages of growing follicles, corpora lutea, granulosa cell layer thickness, and surface area of corpora lutea, in addition to an increase in the number of atretic follicles and follicular cysts, theca cell layer thickness, and surface area of the follicular cysts. All these parameters were recovered with metformin or their NPs11 treatments in different degrees, while local injection of NPs11 was the best option.

Abstract: Summary
The brain receives constant tactile input, but only a subset guides ongoing behavior. Actions associated with tactile stimuli thus endow them with behavioral relevance. It remains unclear how the relevance of tactile stimuli affects processing in the somatosensory (S1) cortex. We developed a cross-modal selection task in which head-fixed mice switched between responding to tactile stimuli in the presence of visual distractors or to visual stimuli in the presence of tactile distractors using licking movements to the left or right side in different blocks of trials. S1 spiking encoded tactile stimuli, licking actions, and direction of licking in response to tactile but not visual stimuli. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulations showed that sensory-motor activity in S1 guided behavior when touch but not vision was relevant. Our results show that S1 activity and its impact on behavior depend on the actions associated with a tactile stimulus.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) of the lymph node (LN) parenchyma orchestrate leukocyte trafficking and peripheral T cell dynamics. T cell responses to immunotherapy largely rely on peripheral T cell recruitment in tumors. Yet, a systematic and molecular understanding of how LECs within the LNs control T cell dynamics under steady-state and tumor-bearing conditions is lacking. Intravital imaging combined with immune phenotyping shows that LEC-specific deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 alters intranodal positioning of lymphocytes and accrues their persistence in the LNs by increasing the availability of the main egress signal sphingosine-1-phosphate. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-draining LNs shows that loss of ATG5 remodels niche-specific LEC phenotypes involved in molecular pathways regulating lymphocyte trafficking and LEC-T cell interactions. Functionally, loss of LEC autophagy prevents recruitment of tumor-infiltrating T and natural killer cells and abrogates response to immunotherapy. Thus, an LEC-autophagy program boosts immune-checkpoint responses by guiding systemic T cell dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium falciparum is a human-adapted apicomplexan parasite that causes the most dangerous form of malaria. P. falciparum cysteine-rich protective antigen (PfCyRPA) is an invasion complex protein essential for erythrocyte invasion. The precise role of PfCyRPA in this process has not been resolved. Here, we show that PfCyRPA is a lectin targeting glycans terminating with α2-6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). PfCyRPA has a >50-fold binding preference for human, α2-6-linked Neu5Ac over non-human, α2-6-linked N-glycolylneuraminic acid. PfCyRPA lectin sites were predicted by molecular modeling and validated by mutagenesis studies. Transgenic parasite lines expressing endogenous PfCyRPA with single amino acid exchange mutants indicated that the lectin activity of PfCyRPA has an important role in parasite invasion. Blocking PfCyRPA lectin activity with small molecules or with lectin-site-specific monoclonal antibodies can inhibit blood-stage parasite multiplication. Therefore, targeting PfCyRPA lectin activity with drugs, immunotherapy, or a vaccine-primed immune response is a promising strategy to prevent and treat malaria.

Second-order cognition including metacognition and mentalizing monitors and regulates first-order cognitive processes. These two-order hierarchical cognitive functions exhibit distinct abilities. However, it remains unclear whether individual differences in these cognitive abilities have distinct origins. We employ the classical twin paradigm to compare the genetic and environmental contributions to the two-order cognitive abilities in the same tasks from the same population. The results reveal that individual differences in first-order cognitive abilities were primarily influenced by genetic factors. Conversely, the second-order cognitive abilities have a stronger influence from shared environmental factors. These findings suggest that the abilities of metacognition and mentalizing in adults are profoundly shaped by their environmental experiences and less determined by their biological nature.

Abstract: Summary
The role of T cell receptor (TCR) diversity in infectious disease susceptibility is not well understood. We use a systems immunology approach on three cohorts of herpes zoster (HZ) patients and controls to investigate whether TCR diversity against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) influences the risk of HZ. We show that CD4+ T cell TCR diversity against VZV glycoprotein E (gE) and immediate early 63 protein (IE63) after 1-week culture is more restricted in HZ patients. Single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of VZV-specific T cells shows that T cell activation pathways are significantly decreased after stimulation with VZV peptides in convalescent HZ patients. TCR clustering indicates that TCRs from HZ patients co-cluster more often together than TCRs from controls. Collectively, our results suggest that not only lower VZV-specific TCR diversity but also reduced functional TCR affinity for VZV-specific proteins in HZ patients leads to lower T cell activation and consequently affects the susceptibility for viral reactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Plant morphogenesis relies exclusively on oriented cell expansion and division. Nonetheless, the mechanism(s) determining division plane orientation remain elusive. Here, we studied tissue healing after laser-assisted wounding in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana and uncovered how mechanical forces stabilize and reorient the microtubule cytoskeleton for the orientation of cell division. We identified that root tissue functions as an interconnected cell matrix, with a radial gradient of tissue extendibility causing predictable tissue deformation after wounding. This deformation causes instant redirection of expansion in the surrounding cells and reorientation of microtubule arrays, ultimately predicting cell division orientation. Microtubules are destabilized under low tension, whereas stretching of cells, either through wounding or external aspiration, immediately induces their polymerization. The higher microtubule abundance in the stretched cell parts leads to the reorientation of microtubule arrays and, ultimately, informs cell division planes. This provides a long-sought mechanism for flexible re-arrangement of cell divisions by mechanical forces for tissue reconstruction and plant architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian Notch signaling occurs when the binding of Delta or Jagged to Notch stimulates the proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which enters the nucleus to control target gene expression. To determine the temporal dynamics of events associated with Notch signaling under native conditions, we fluorescently tagged Notch and Delta at their endogenous genomic loci and visualized them upon pairing of receiver (Notch) and sender (Delta) cells as a function of time after cell contact. At contact sites, Notch and Delta immediately accumulated at 1:1 stoichiometry in synapses, which resolved by 15–20 min after contact. Synapse formation preceded the entrance of the Notch extracellular domain into the sender cell and accumulation of NICD in the nucleus of the receiver cell, which approached a maximum after ∼45 min and was prevented by chemical and genetic inhibitors of signaling. These findings directly link Notch-Delta synapse dynamics to NICD production with spatiotemporal precision.

Abstract: Summary
The blueprint of the mammalian body plan is laid out during gastrulation, when a trilaminar embryo is formed. This process entails a burst of proliferation, the ingression of embryonic epiblast cells at the primitive streak, and their priming toward primitive streak fates. How these different events are coordinated remains unknown. Here, we developed and characterized a 3D culture of self-renewing mouse embryonic cells that captures the main transcriptional and architectural features of the early gastrulating mouse epiblast. Using this system in combination with microfabrication and in vivo experiments, we found that proliferation-induced crowding triggers delamination of cells that express high levels of the apical polarity protein aPKC. Upon delamination, cells become more sensitive to Wnt signaling and upregulate the expression of primitive streak markers such as Brachyury. This mechanistic coupling between ingression and differentiation ensures that the right cell types become specified at the right place during embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
De novo brown adipogenesis holds potential in combating the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. However, the identity of brown adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) and their regulation have not been extensively explored. Here, through in vivo lineage tracing and mouse modeling, we observed that platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ)+ pericytes give rise to developmental brown adipocytes but not to those in adult homeostasis. By contrast, T-box 18 (TBX18)+ pericytes contribute to brown adipogenesis throughout both developmental and adult stages, though in a depot-specific manner. Mechanistically, Notch inhibition in PDGFRβ+ pericytes promotes brown adipogenesis by downregulating PDGFRβ. Furthermore, inhibition of Notch signaling in PDGFRβ+ pericytes mitigates high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS)-induced glucose and metabolic impairment in mice during their development and juvenile phases. Collectively, these findings show that the Notch/PDGFRβ axis negatively regulates developmental brown adipogenesis, and its repression promotes brown adipose tissue expansion and improves metabolic health.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are normally produced in skeletal muscle. However, an imbalance in their regulatory systems can lead to their accumulation and ultimately to oxidative stress, which is one of the causes of the ageing process. Companion dogs share the same environment and lifestyle as humans, making them an excellent comparative model for the study of ageing, as well as they constitute a growing market for bioactive molecules that improve the quality of life of pets. The anti-ageing properties of oleuropein aglycone (OLE), a bioactive compound from olive leaves known for its antioxidant properties, were investigated in Myok9 canine muscle cell model. After incubation with OLE, senescence was induced in the canine cellular model by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Analyses were performed on cells after seven days of differentiation. The oxidative stress induced by H2O2 treatment on differentiated canine muscle cells led to a significant increase in ROS formation, which was reduced by OLE pretreatment alone or in combination with H2O2 by about 34% and 32%, respectively. Cells treated with H2O2 showed a 48% increase the area of senescent cells stained by SA-β-gal, while OLE significantly reduced the coloured area by 52%. OLE, alone or in combination with H2O2, showed a significant antioxidant activity, possibly through autophagy activation, as indicated by the expression of autophagic markers.

Abstract: Summary
Nearly all trait-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are noncoding. The cis regulatory effects of these variants have been extensively characterized, but how they affect gene regulation in trans has been the subject of fewer studies because of the difficulty in detecting trans-expression quantitative loci (eQTLs). We developed trans-PCO for detecting trans effects of genetic variants on gene networks. Our simulations demonstrate that trans-PCO substantially outperforms existing trans-eQTL mapping methods. We applied trans-PCO to two gene expression datasets from whole blood, DGN (N = 913) and eQTLGen (N = 31,684), and identified 14,985 high-quality trans-eSNP-module pairs associated with 197 co-expression gene modules and biological processes. We performed colocalization analyses between GWAS loci of 46 complex traits and the trans-eQTLs. We demonstrated that the identified trans effects can help us understand how trait-associated variants affect gene regulatory networks and biological pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) enzymes mutate specific DNA sequences and hairpin-loop structures, challenging the distinction between passenger and driver hotspot mutations. Here, we characterized 115 whole genomes of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) to identify APOBEC mutagenic hotspot drivers. APOBEC-associated mutations were detected in 92% of mUCs and were equally distributed across the genome, while APOBEC hotspot mutations (ApoHMs) were enriched in open chromatin. Hairpin loops were frequent targets of didymi (twins in Greek), two hotspot mutations characterized by the APOBEC SBS2 signature, in conjunction with an uncharacterized mutational context (Ap[C>T]). Next, we developed a statistical framework that identified ApoHMs as drivers in coding and non-coding genomic regions of mUCs. Our results and statistical framework were validated in independent cohorts of 23 non-metastatic UCs and 3,744 samples of 17 metastatic cancers, identifying cancer-type-specific drivers. Our study highlights the role of APOBEC in cancer development and may contribute to developing novel targeted therapy options for APOBEC-driven cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) features an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that resists immunotherapy. Tumor-associated macrophages, abundant in the TME, modulate T cell responses. Bone marrow stromal antigen 2-positive (BST2+) macrophages increase in KrasG12D/+; Trp53R172H/+; Pdx1-Cre mouse models during PDAC progression. However, their role in PDAC remains elusive. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between BST2+ macrophage levels and PDAC patient prognosis. Moreover, an increased ratio of exhausted CD8+ T cells is observed in tumors with up-regulated BST2+ macrophages. Mechanistically, BST2+ macrophages secrete CXCL7 through the ERK pathway and bind with CXCR2 to activate the AKT/mTOR pathway, promoting CD8+ T cell exhaustion. The combined blockade of CXCL7 and programmed death-ligand 1 successfully decelerates tumor growth. Additionally, cGAS-STING pathway activation in macrophages induces interferon (IFN)α synthesis leading to BST2 overexpression in the PDAC TME. This study provides insights into IFNα-induced BST2+ macrophages driving an immune-suppressive TME through ERK-CXCL7 signaling to regulate CD8+ T cell exhaustion in PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Bone secretory proteins, termed osteokines, regulate bone metabolism and whole-body homeostasis. However, fundamental questions as to what the bona fide osteokines and their cellular sources are and how they are regulated remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed bone and extraskeletal tissues, osteoblast (OB) conditioned media, bone marrow supernatant (BMS), and serum, for basal osteokines and those responsive to aging and mechanical loading/unloading. We identified 375 candidate osteokines and their changes in response to aging and mechanical dynamics by integrating data from RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and proteomic approaches. Furthermore, we analyzed their cellular sources in the bone and inter-organ communication facilitated by them (bone-brain, liver, and aorta). Notably, we discovered that senescent OBs secrete fatty-acid-binding protein 3 to propagate senescence toward vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Taken together, we identified previously unknown candidate osteokines and established a dynamic regulatory network among them, thus providing valuable resources to further investigate their systemic roles.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical evidence has revealed that high-level activation of NRF2 caused by somatic mutations in NRF2 (NFE2L2) is frequently detected in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), whereas that caused by somatic mutations in KEAP1, a negative regulator of NRF2, is not. Here, we aspire to generate a mouse model of NRF2-activated ESCC using the cancer-derived NRF2L30F mutation and cancer driver mutant TRP53R172H. Concomitant expression of NRF2L30F and TRP53R172H results in formation of NRF2-activated ESCC-like lesions. In contrast, while squamous-cell-specific deletion of KEAP1 induces similar NRF2 hyperactivation, the loss of KEAP1 combined with expression of TRP53R172H does not elicit the formation of ESCC-like lesions. Instead, KEAP1-deleted cells disappear from the esophageal epithelium over time. These findings demonstrate that, while cellular NRF2 levels are similarly induced, NRF2 gain of function and KEAP1 loss of function elicits distinct fates of squamous cells. The NRF2L30F mutant mouse model developed here will be instrumental in elucidating the mechanistic basis leading to NRF2-activated ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of putative assembly scaffolds has been proposed to drive the biogenesis of membraneless compartments. LLPS scaffolds are usually identified through in vitro LLPS assays with single macromolecules (homotypic), but the predictive value of these assays remains poorly characterized. Here, we apply a strategy to evaluate the robustness of homotypic LLPS assays. When applied to the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which undergoes LLPS in vitro and localizes to centromeres to promote chromosome biorientation, LLPS propensity in vitro emerged as an unreliable predictor of subcellular localization. In vitro CPC LLPS in aqueous buffers was enhanced by commonly used crowding agents. Conversely, diluted cytomimetic media dissolved condensates of the CPC and of several other proteins. We also show that centromeres do not seem to nucleate LLPS, nor do they promote local, spatially restrained LLPS of the CPC. Our strategy can be adapted to purported LLPS scaffolds of other membraneless compartments.

Abstract: Summary
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) commonly afflict people with diabetes. To better understand the mechanisms that predispose diabetics to UTIs, we employ diabetic mouse models and altered insulin signaling to show that insulin receptor (IR) shapes UTI defenses. Our findings are validated in human biosamples. We report that diabetic mice have suppressed IR expression and are more susceptible to UTIs caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Systemic IR inhibition increases UPEC susceptibility, while IR activation reduces UTIs. Localized IR deletion in bladder urothelium promotes UTI by increasing barrier permeability and suppressing antimicrobial peptides. Mechanistically, IR deletion reduces nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent programming that co-regulates urothelial tight junction integrity and antimicrobial peptides. Exfoliated urothelial cells or urine samples from diabetic youths show suppressed expression of IR, barrier genes, and antimicrobial peptides. These observations demonstrate that urothelial insulin signaling has a role in UTI prevention and link IR to urothelial barrier maintenance and antimicrobial peptide expression.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Translation of messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) encoding integral membrane proteins or secreted proteins occurs on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When a nascent signal peptide is synthesized from the mRNAs, the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and then transported to the surface of the ER. The appropriate targeting of the RNC-SRP complex to the ER is monitored by a quality control pathway, a nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC)-ensured translational repression of RNC-SRP (CENTRE). In this study, using ribosome profiling of CBC-associated and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-associated mRNAs, we reveal that, at the transcriptomic level, CENTRE is in charge of the translational repression of the CBC-RNC-SRP until the complex is specifically transported to the ER. We also find that CENTRE inhibits the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of mRNAs within the CBC-RNC-SRP. The NMD occurs only after the CBC-RNC-SRP is targeted to the ER and after eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E replaces CBC. Our data indicate dual surveillance for properly targeting mRNAs encoding integral membrane or secretory proteins to the ER. CENTRE blocks gene expression at the translation level before the CBC-RNC-SRP delivery to the ER, and NMD monitors mRNA quality after its delivery to the ER.

Abstract: Summary
DNA sensing is important for antiviral immunity. The DNA sensor cGAS synthesizes 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a second messenger that activates STING, which induces innate immunity. cGAMP not only activates STING in the cell where it is produced but cGAMP also transfers to other cells. Transporters, channels, and pores (including SLC19A1, SLC46A2, P2X7, ABCC1, and volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs)) release cGAMP into the extracellular space and/or import cGAMP. We report that infection with multiple human viruses depletes some of these cGAMP conduits. This includes herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) that targets SLC46A2, P2X7, and the VRAC subunits LRRC8A and LRRC8C for degradation. The HSV-1 protein UL56 is necessary and sufficient for these effects that are mediated at least partially by proteasomal turnover. UL56 thereby inhibits cGAMP uptake via VRAC, SLC46A2, and P2X7. Taken together, HSV-1 antagonizes intercellular cGAMP transfer. We propose that this limits innate immunity by reducing cell-to-cell communication via the immunotransmitter cGAMP.

Abstract: Summary
Telomere dynamics are linked to aging hallmarks, and age-associated telomere loss fuels the development of epithelial cancers. In Apc-mutant mice, the onset of DNA damage associated with telomere dysfunction has been shown to accelerate adenoma initiation via unknown mechanisms. Here, we observed that Apc-mutant mice engineered to experience telomere dysfunction show accelerated adenoma formation resulting from augmented cell competition and clonal expansion. Mechanistically, telomere dysfunction induces the repression of EZH2, resulting in the derepression of Wnt antagonists, which causes the differentiation of adjacent stem cells and a relative growth advantage to Apc-deficient telomere dysfunctional cells. Correspondingly, in this mouse model, GSK3β inhibition countered the actions of Wnt antagonists on intestinal stem cells, resulting in impaired adenoma formation of telomere dysfunctional Apc-mutant cells. Thus, telomere dysfunction contributes to cancer initiation through altered stem cell dynamics, identifying an interception strategy for human APC-mutant cancers with shortened telomeres.

Abstract: Summary
Layer 5 neurons of the neocortex receive their principal inputs from layer 2/3 neurons. We seek to identify the nature and extent of the plasticity of these projections with motor learning. Using optogenetic and viral intersectional tools to selectively stimulate distinct neuronal subsets in rat primary motor cortex, we simultaneously record from pairs of corticospinal neurons associated with distinct features of motor output control: distal forelimb vs. proximal forelimb. Activation of Channelrhodopsin2-expressing layer 2/3 afferents onto layer 5 in untrained animals produces greater monosynaptic excitation of neurons controlling the proximal forelimb. Following skilled grasp training, layer 2/3 inputs onto corticospinal neurons controlling the distal forelimb associated with skilled grasping become significantly stronger. Moreover, peak excitatory response amplitude nearly doubles while latency shortens, and excitatory-to-inhibitory latencies become significantly prolonged. These findings demonstrate distinct, highly segregated, and cell-specific plasticity of layer 2/3 projections during skilled grasp motor learning.

Abstract: Summary
The production of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) requires high expression of the transcription factor IRF8. Three enhancers at the Irf8 3′ region function in a differentiation stage-specific manner. However, whether and how these enhancers interact physically and functionally remains unclear. Here, we show that the Irf8 3′ enhancers directly interact with each other and contact the Irf8 gene body during cDC1 differentiation. The +56 kb enhancer, which functions from multipotent progenitor stages, activates the other 3′ enhancers through an IRF8-dependent transcription factor program, that is, in trans. Then, the +32 kb enhancer, which operates in cDC1-committed cells, reversely acts in cis on the other 3′ enhancers to maintain the high expression of Irf8. Indeed, mice with compound heterozygous deletion of the +56 and +32 kb enhancers are unable to generate cDC1s. These results illustrate how multiple enhancers cooperate to induce a lineage-determining transcription factor gene during cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription and splicing of pre-messenger RNA are closely coordinated, but how this functional coupling is disrupted in human diseases remains unexplored. Using isogenic cell lines, patient samples, and a mutant mouse model, we investigated how cancer-associated mutations in SF3B1 alter transcription. We found that these mutations reduce the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) along gene bodies and its density at promoters. The elongation defect results from disrupted pre-spliceosome assembly due to impaired protein-protein interactions of mutant SF3B1. The decreased promoter-proximal RNAPII density reduces both chromatin accessibility and H3K4me3 marks at promoters. Through an unbiased screen, we identified epigenetic factors in the Sin3/HDAC/H3K4me pathway, which, when modulated, reverse both transcription and chromatin changes. Our findings reveal how splicing factor mutant states behave functionally as epigenetic disorders through impaired transcription-related changes to the chromatin landscape. We also present a rationale for targeting the Sin3/HDAC complex as a therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations may reflect the existence of genetic interactions, potentially shaping distinct biological phenotypes and impacting therapeutic response in breast cancer. However, our understanding of them remains limited. Herein, we investigate a large-scale multi-omics cohort (n = 873) and a real-world clinical sequencing cohort (n = 4,405) including several clinical trials with detailed treatment outcomes and perform functional validation in patient-derived organoids, tumor fragments, and in vivo models. Through this comprehensive approach, we construct a network comprising co-alterations and mutually exclusive events and characterize their therapeutic potential and underlying biological basis. Notably, we identify associations between TP53mut-AURKAamp and endocrine therapy resistance, germline BRCA1mut-MYCamp and improved sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, and TP53mut-MYBamp and immunotherapy resistance. Furthermore, we reveal that precision treatment strategies informed by co-alterations hold promise to improve patient outcomes. Our study highlights the significance of genetic interactions in guiding genome-informed treatment decisions beyond single driver alterations.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic stress disrupts microbiota-gut-brain axis function and is associated with altered tryptophan metabolism, impaired gut barrier function, and disrupted diurnal rhythms. However, little is known about the effects of acute stress on the gut and how it is influenced by diurnal physiology. Here, we used germ-free and antibiotic-depleted mice to understand how microbiota-dependent oscillations in tryptophan metabolism would alter gut barrier function at baseline and in response to an acute stressor. Cecal metabolomics identified tryptophan metabolism as most responsive to a 15-min acute stressor, while shotgun metagenomics revealed that most bacterial species exhibiting rhythmicity metabolize tryptophan. Our findings highlight that the gastrointestinal response to acute stress is dependent on the time of day and the microbiome, with a signature of stress-induced functional alterations in the ileum and altered tryptophan metabolism in the colon.

Abstract: Summary
RNase L is an endoribonuclease of higher vertebrates that functions in antiviral innate immunity. Interferons induce oligoadenylate synthetase enzymes that sense double-stranded RNA of viral origin leading to the synthesis of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate (2-5A) activators of RNase L. However, it is unknown precisely how RNase L remodels the host cell transcriptome. To isolate effects of RNase L from other effects of double-stranded RNA or virus, 2-5A is directly introduced into cells. Here, we report that RNase L activation by 2-5A causes a ribotoxic stress response involving the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) ZAKα, MAP2Ks, and the stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38α. RNase L activation profoundly alters the transcriptome by widespread depletion of mRNAs associated with different cellular functions but also by JNK/p38α-stimulated induction of inflammatory genes. These results show that the 2-5A/RNase L system triggers a protein kinase cascade leading to proinflammatory signaling and apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA-PK, is an essential regulator of DNA damage repair. DNA-PK-driven phosphorylation events and the activated DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are also components of antiviral intrinsic and innate immune responses. Yet, it is not clear whether and how the DNA-PK response differs between these two forms of nucleic acid stress—DNA damage and DNA virus infection. Here, we define DNA-PK substrates and the signature cellular phosphoproteome response to DNA damage or infection with the nuclear-replicating DNA herpesvirus, HSV-1. We establish that DNA-PK negatively regulates the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) DDR kinase during viral infection. In turn, ATM blocks the binding of DNA-PK and the nuclear DNA sensor IFI16 to viral DNA, thereby inhibiting cytokine responses. However, following DNA damage, DNA-PK enhances ATM activity, which is required for IFN-β expression. These findings demonstrate that the DDR autoregulates cytokine expression through the opposing modulation of DDR kinases.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokines regulate immune responses by binding to cell surface receptors, including the common subunit beta (βc), which mediates signaling for GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5. Despite known roles in inflammation, the structural basis of IL-5 receptor activation remains unclear. We present the cryo-EM structure of the human IL-5 ternary receptor complex, revealing architectural principles for IL-5, GM-CSF, and IL-3. In mammalian cell culture, single-molecule imaging confirms hexameric IL-5 complex formation on cell surfaces. Engineered chimeric receptors show that IL-5 signaling, as well as IL-3 and GM-CSF, can occur through receptor heterodimerization, obviating the need for higher-order assemblies of βc dimers. These findings provide insights into IL-5 and βc receptor family signaling mechanisms, aiding in the development of therapies for diseases involving deranged βc signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The transmembrane channel-like (TMC) protein family comprises eight members, with TMC1 and TMC2 being extensively studied. This study demonstrates substantial co-expression of TMC7 with the mechanosensitive channel Piezo2 in somatosensory neurons. Genetic deletion of TMC7 in primary sensory ganglia neurons in vivo enhances sensitivity in both physiological and pathological mechanosensory transduction. This deletion leads to an increase in proportion of rapidly adapting (RA) currents conducted by Piezo2 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and accelerates RA deactivation kinetics. In HEK293 cells expressing both proteins, TMC7 significantly suppresses the current amplitudes of co-expressed Piezo2. Our findings reveal that TMC7 and Piezo2 exhibit physical interactions, and both proteins also physically interact with cytoskeletal β-actin. We hypothesize that TMC7 functions as an inhibitory modulator of Piezo2 in DRG neurons, either through direct inhibition or by disrupting the transmission of mechanical forces from the cytoskeleton to the channel.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscles exert remarkable regenerative or adaptive capacities in response to injuries or mechanical loads. However, the cellular networks underlying muscle adaptation are poorly understood compared to those underlying muscle regeneration. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the gene expression patterns and cellular networks activated in overloaded muscles and compared these results with those observed in regenerating muscles. The cellular composition of the 4-day overloaded muscle, when macrophage infiltration peaked, closely resembled that of the 10-day regenerating muscle. In addition to the mesenchymal progenitor-muscle satellite cell (MuSC) axis, interactome analyses or targeted depletion experiments revealed communications between mesenchymal progenitors-macrophages and macrophages-MuSCs. Furthermore, granulin, a macrophage-derived factor, inhibited MuSC differentiation, and Granulin-knockout mice exhibited blunted muscle hypertrophy due to the premature differentiation of overloaded MuSCs. These findings reveal the critical role of granulin through the relayed communications of mesenchymal progenitors, macrophages, and MuSCs in facilitating efficient muscle hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial remodeling of the Drosophila retina depends on the pulsatile contraction and expansion of apical contacts between the cells that form its hexagonal lattice. Phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) accumulates around tricellular adherens junctions (tAJs) during contact expansion and dissipates during contraction, but with unknown function. Here, we found that manipulations of Pten or PI3-kinase (PI3K) that either decreased or increased PIP3 resulted in shortened contacts and a disordered lattice, indicating a requirement for PIP3 dynamics and turnover. These phenotypes are caused by a loss of branched actin, resulting from impaired activity of the Rac1 Rho GTPase and the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). We additionally found that during contact expansion, PI3K moves into tAJs to promote the cyclical increase of PIP3 in a spatially and temporally precise manner. Thus, dynamic control of PIP3 by Pten and PI3K governs the protrusive phase of junctional remodeling, which is essential for planar epithelial morphogenesis.

Abstract: Increased brain size and its rostral bias are hallmarks of vertebrate evolution, but the underlying developmental and genetic basis remains poorly understood. To provide clues to understanding vertebrate brain evolution, we investigated the developmental mechanisms of brain enlargement observed in the offspring of a previously unrecognized, spontaneously occurring female variant line of Xenopus that appears to reflect a genetic variation. Brain enlargement in larvae from this line showed a pronounced rostral bias that could be traced back to the neural plate, the primordium of the brain. At the gastrula stage, the Spemann organizer, which is known to induce the neural plate from the adjacent dorsal ectoderm and give it the initial rostrocaudal patterning, was expanded from dorsal to ventral in a large proportion of the offspring of variant females. Consistently, siamois expression, which is required for Spemann organizer formation, was expanded laterally from dorsal to ventral at the blastula stage in variant offspring. This implies that the active region of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was similarly expanded in advance on the dorsal side, as siamois is a target gene of this pathway. Notably, the earliest detectable change in variant offspring was in fertilized eggs, in which maternal wnt11b mRNA, a candidate dorsalizing factor responsible for activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the dorsal embryonic region, had a wider distribution in the vegetal cortical cytoplasm. Since lateral spreading of wnt11b mRNA, and possibly that of other potential maternal dorsalizing factors in these eggs, is expected to facilitate lateral expansion of the active region of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway during subsequent embryonic stages, we concluded that aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling could cause rostral-biased brain enlargement via expansion of siamois expression and consequent expansion of the Spemann organizer in Xenopus. Our studies of spontaneously occurring variations in brain development in Xenopus would provide hints for uncovering genetic mutations that drive analogous morphogenetic variations during vertebrate brain evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Bone is regarded as one of few tissues that heals without fibrous scar. The outer layer of the periosteum is covered with fibrous tissue, whose function in bone formation is unknown. We herein developed a system to distinguish the fate of fibrous-layer periosteal cells (FL-PCs) from the skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) in the cambium-layer periosteum and bone marrow in mice. We showed that FL-PCs did not participate in steady-state osteogenesis, but formed the main body of fibrocartilaginous callus during fracture healing. Moreover, FL-PCs invaded the cambium-layer periosteum and bone marrow after fracture, forming neo-SSPCs that continued to maintain the healed bones throughout adulthood. The FL-PC-derived neo-SSPCs expressed lower levels of osteogenic signature genes and displayed lower osteogenic differentiation activity than the preexisting SSPCs. Consistent with this, healed bones were thinner and formed more slowly than normal bones. Thus, the fibrous periosteum becomes the cellular origin of bones after fracture and alters bone properties permanently.

Abstract: Summary
Basement membranes (BMs) are sheet-like structures of extracellular matrix (ECM) that provide structural support for many tissues and play a central role in signaling. They are key regulators of cell behavior and tissue functions, and defects in their assembly or composition are involved in numerous human diseases. Due to the differences between human and animal embryogenesis, ethical concerns, legal constraints, the scarcity of human tissue material, and the inaccessibility of the in vivo condition, BM regulation during human embryo development has remained elusive. Using the post-implantation amniotic sac embryoid (PASE), we delineate BM assembly upon post-implantation development and BM disassembly during primitive streak (PS) cell dissemination. Further, we show that the transcription factor Oct4 regulates the expression of BM structural components and receptors and controls BM development by regulating Akt signaling and the small GTPase Rac1. These results represent a relevant step toward a more comprehensive understanding of early human development.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a crucial RNA modification that regulates diverse biological processes in human cells, but its co-transcriptional deposition and functions remain poorly understood. Here, we identified the RNA helicase DDX21 with a previously unrecognized role in directing m6A modification on nascent RNA for co-transcriptional regulation. DDX21 interacts with METTL3 for co-recruitment to chromatin through its recognition of R-loops, which can be formed co-transcriptionally as nascent transcripts hybridize onto the template DNA strand. Moreover, DDX21’s helicase activity is needed for METTL3-mediated m6A deposition onto nascent RNA following recruitment. At transcription termination regions, this nexus of actions promotes XRN2-mediated termination of RNAPII transcription. Disruption of any of these steps, including the loss of DDX21, METTL3, or their enzymatic activities, leads to defective termination that can induce DNA damage. Therefore, we propose that the R-loop-DDX21-METTL3 nexus forges the missing link for co-transcriptional modification of m6A, coordinating transcription termination and genome stability.

Abstract: Background
Stem cell differentiation has opened up new avenues for disease treatment, tissue repair, and drug development in the study of regenerative medicine, and has huge application prospects. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of quercetin on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into fibroblasts.
Methods
In this study, cell differentiation experiments and flow cytometry were used to detect the successful isolation of bone marrow MSCs from SD rats. Quercetin at 5, 10, and 20 μM was used as low, medium, and high doses to intervene in MSCs. The cell viability changes of ligament fibroblasts at 24, 48, and 72 hours after quercetin treatment were detected using a CCK-8 cell counting kit. Cell proliferative capacity was determined by flow cytometry. RT-qPCR measured the relative expression levels of TGF-β1, IGF-1, COL-Ⅰ, COL-Ⅲ, FN (fibronectin), and TNMD (Tenomodulin) in different experimental groups. Molecular docking experiments were conducted to explore the binding effect of quercetin on TGF-β1 and IGF-1 proteins.
Results
Flow cytometry verified the successful isolation of MSCs, which had high expression of CD29 and CD73, while lower expression of CD90 and CD45. Experimental results show that low and medium doses of quercetin can enhance cell proliferation, while high doses have no significant effect on cells. Detection of cell proliferation through flow cytometry yielded similar results to CCK-8. Transwell experiments have shown that low and medium doses of quercetin can increase cell migration ability. In addition, RT-qPCR detection showed that quercetin can increase the mRNA expression of TGF-β1 and IGF-1, and promote the expression of COL-Ⅰ, COL-Ⅲ, FN, and TNMD genes in ligament fibroblasts. Molecular docking results showed that quercetin can bind firmly to TGF-β1 and IGF-1.
Conclusion
Overall, this study revealed the morphological characteristics and identification of MSCs, as well as the regulatory mechanism of quercetin on the behavior of ligament fibroblasts. Quercetin affects the proliferation and gene expression of ligament fibroblasts by regulating the expression of TGF-β1 and IGF-1, which may provide a new perspective for biomedical research on the skeletal system.

Abstract: Summary
To better understand the function of cholinergic projection neurons in the ventral pallidum (VP), we examined behavioral responses to appetitive (APP) and aversive (AV) odors that elicited approach or avoidance, respectively. Exposure to each odor increased cFos expression and calcium signaling in VP cholinergic neurons. Activity and Cre-dependent viral vectors selectively labeled VP cholinergic neurons that were activated and reactivated in response to either APP or AV odors, but not both, identifying two non-overlapping populations of VP cholinergic neurons differentially activated by the valence of olfactory stimuli. These two subpopulations showed differences in electrophysiological properties, morphology, and projections to the basolateral amygdala. Although VP neurons are engaged in both approach and avoidance behavioral responses, cholinergic signaling is only required for approach behavior. Thus, two distinct subpopulations of VP cholinergic neurons differentially encode valence of olfactory stimuli and play distinct roles in approach and avoidance behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
The vaginal microbiome’s composition varies among ethnicities. However, the evolutionary landscape of the vaginal microbiome in the multi-ethnic context remains understudied. We perform a systematic evolutionary analysis of 351 vaginal microbiome samples from 35 multi-ethnic pregnant women, in addition to two validation cohorts, totaling 462 samples from 90 women. Microbiome alpha diversity and community state dynamics show strong ethnic signatures. Lactobacillaceae have a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism and lower nucleotide diversity than non-Lactobacillaceae in all ethnicities, with a large repertoire of positively selected genes, including the mucin-binding and cell wall anchor genes. These evolutionary dynamics are driven by the long-term evolutionary process unique to the human vaginal niche. Finally, we propose an evolutionary model reflecting the environmental niches of microbes. Our study reveals the extensive ethnic signatures in vaginal microbial ecology and evolution, highlighting the importance of studying the host-microbiome ecosystem from an evolutionary perspective.

Abstract: Summary
Cholera toxin (CT), a bacterial exotoxin composed of one A subunit (CTA) and five B subunits (CTB), functions as an immune adjuvant. CTB can induce production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a proinflammatory cytokine, in synergy with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from resident peritoneal macrophages (RPMs) through the pyrin and NLRP3 inflammasomes. However, how CTB or CT activates these inflammasomes in the macrophages has been unclear. Here, we clarify the roles of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor, in CT-induced IL-1β production in RPMs. In RPMs, CTB is incorporated into the ER and induces ER stress responses, depending on GM1, a cell membrane ganglioside. IRE1α-deficient RPMs show a significant impairment of CT- or CTB-induced IL-1β production, indicating that IRE1α is required for CT- or CTB-induced IL-1β production in RPMs. This study demonstrates the critical roles of IRE1α in activation of both NLRP3 and pyrin inflammasomes in tissue-resident macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a challenging condition that occurs after musculoskeletal injury and is characterized by the formation of bone in non-skeletal tissues. While the effect of HO on blood vessels is well established, little is known about its impact on lymphatic vessels. Here, we use a mouse model of traumatic HO to investigate the relationship between HO and lymphatic vessels. We show that injury triggers lymphangiogenesis at the injury site, which is associated with elevated vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) levels. Through single-cell transcriptomic analyses, we identify mesenchymal progenitor cells and tenocytes as sources of Vegfc. We demonstrate by lineage tracing that Vegfc-expressing cells undergo osteochondral differentiation and contribute to the formation of HO. Last, we show that Vegfc haploinsufficiency results in a nearly 50% reduction in lymphangiogenesis and HO formation. These findings shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying HO formation and its impact on lymphatic vessels.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic syndrome is accompanied by vascular complications. Human in vitro disease models are hence required to better understand vascular dysfunctions and guide clinical therapies. Here, we engineered an open microfluidic vessel-on-chip platform that integrates human pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (SC-ECs). The open microfluidic design enables seamless integration with state-of-the-art analytical technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics by mass spectrometry, and high-resolution imaging. Beyond previous systems, we report SC-EC maturation by means of barrier formation, arterial toning, and high nitric oxide synthesis levels under gravity-driven flow. Functionally, we corroborate the hallmarks of early-onset atherosclerosis with low sample volumes and cell numbers under flow conditions by determining proteome and secretome changes in SC-ECs stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein and free fatty acids. More broadly, our organ-on-chip platform enables the modeling of patient-specific human endothelial tissue and has the potential to become a general tool for animal-free vascular research.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence suggests a beneficial role of rhizobacteria in ameliorating plant disease resistance in an environment-friendly way. In this study, we characterize a rhizobacterium, Bacillus cereus NJ01, that enhances bacterial pathogen resistance in rice and Arabidopsis. Transcriptome analyses show that root inoculation of NJ01 induces the expression of salicylic acid (SA)- and abscisic acid (ABA)-related genes in Arabidopsis leaves. Genetic evidence showed that EDS1, PAD4, and WRKY18 are required for B. cereus NJ01-induced bacterial resistance. An EDS1-PAD4 complex interacts with WRKY18 and enhances its DNA binding activity. WRKY18 directly binds to the W box in the promoter region of the SA biosynthesis gene ICS1 and ABA biosynthesis genes NCED3 and NCED5 and contributes to the NJ01-induced bacterial resistance. Taken together, our findings indicate a role of the EDS1/PAD4-WRKY18 complex in rhizobacteria-induced disease resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Sampling behaviors have sensory consequences that can hinder perceptual stability. In olfaction, sniffing affects early odor encoding, mimicking a sudden change in odor concentration. We examined how the inhalation speed affects the representation of odor concentration in the main olfactory cortex. Neurons combine the odor input with a global top-down signal preceding the sniff and a mechanosensory feedback generated by the air passage through the nose during inhalation. Still, the population representation of concentration is remarkably sniff invariant. This is because the mechanosensory and olfactory responses are uncorrelated within and across neurons. Thus, faster odor inhalation and an increase in concentration change the cortical activity pattern in distinct ways. This encoding strategy affords tolerance to potential concentration fluctuations caused by varying inhalation speeds. Since mechanosensory reafferences are widespread across sensory systems, the coding scheme described here may be a canonical strategy to mitigate the sensory ambiguities caused by movements.

Abstract: Summary
Brain cells release and take up small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) containing bioactive nucleic acids. sEV exchange is hypothesized to contribute to stereotyped spread of neuropathological changes in the diseased brain. We assess mRNA from sEVs of postmortem brain from non-diseased (ND) individuals and those with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using short- and long-read sequencing. sEV transcriptomes are distinct from those of bulk tissue, showing enrichment for genes including mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and transposable elements such as human-specific LINE-1 (L1Hs). AD versus ND sEVs show enrichment of inflammation-related mRNAs and depletion of synaptic signaling mRNAs. sEV mRNAs from cultured murine primary neurons, astrocytes, or microglia show similarities to human brain sEVs and reveal cell-type-specific packaging. Approximately 80% of neural sEV transcripts sequenced using long-read sequencing are full length. Motif analyses of sEV-enriched isoforms elucidate RNA-binding proteins that may be associated with sEV loading. Collectively, we show that mRNA in brain sEVs is intact, selectively packaged, and altered in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are alarmingly common, and treatment is confined to last-line antibiotics. Vancomycin is the treatment of choice for MRSA bacteremia, and treatment failure is often associated with vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus isolates. The regulatory 3′ UTR of the vigR mRNA contributes to vancomycin tolerance and upregulates the autolysin IsaA. Using MS2-affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing, we find that the vigR 3′ UTR also regulates dapE, a succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase required for lysine and peptidoglycan synthesis, suggesting a broader role in controlling cell wall metabolism and vancomycin tolerance. Deletion of the 3′ UTR increased virulence, while the isaA mutant is completely attenuated in a wax moth larvae model. Sequence and structural analyses of vigR indicated that the 3′ UTR has expanded through the acquisition of Staphylococcus aureus repeat insertions that contribute sequence for the isaA interaction seed and may functionalize the 3′ UTR.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor-mediated signaling plays a central role in tissue regeneration, and it is dysregulated in disease. Here, we build a signaling-response map for a model regenerative human tissue: the airway epithelium. We analyzed the effect of 17 receptor-mediated signaling pathways on organotypic cultures to determine changes in abundance and phenotype of epithelial cell types. This map recapitulates the gamut of known airway epithelial signaling responses to these pathways. It defines convergent states induced by multiple ligands and diverse, ligand-specific responses in basal cell and secretory cell metaplasia. We show that loss of canonical differentiation induced by multiple pathways is associated with cell-cycle arrest, but that arrest is not sufficient to block differentiation. Using the signaling-response map, we show that a TGFB1-mediated response underlies specific aberrant cells found in multiple lung diseases and identify interferon responses in COVID-19 patient samples. Thus, we offer a framework enabling systematic evaluation of tissue signaling responses. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
The brain can generate actions, such as reaching to a target, using different movement strategies. We investigate how such strategies are learned in a task where perched head-fixed mice learn to reach to an invisible target area from a set start position using a joystick. This can be achieved by learning to move in a specific direction or to a specific endpoint location. As mice learn to reach the target, they refine their variable joystick trajectories into controlled reaches, which depend on the sensorimotor cortex. We show that individual mice learned strategies biased to either direction- or endpoint-based movements. This endpoint/direction bias correlates with spatial directional variability with which the workspace was explored during training. Model-free reinforcement learning agents can generate both strategies with similar correlation between variability during training and learning bias. These results provide evidence that reinforcement of individual exploratory behavior during training biases the reaching strategies that mice learn.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic infection elicits behaviors that promote recovery and survival of the host. After exposure to the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans modifies its sensory preferences to avoid the pathogen. Here, we identify antagonistic neuromodulators that shape this acquired avoidance behavior. Using an unbiased cell-directed neuropeptide screen, we show that AVK neurons upregulate and release RF/RYamide FLP-1 neuropeptides during infection to drive pathogen avoidance. Manipulations that increase or decrease AVK activity accelerate or delay pathogen avoidance, respectively, implicating AVK in the dynamics of avoidance behavior. FLP-1 neuropeptides drive pathogen avoidance through the G protein-coupled receptor DMSR-7, as well as other receptors. DMSR-7 in turn acts in multiple neurons, including tyraminergic/octopaminergic neurons that receive convergent avoidance signals from the cytokine DAF-7/transforming growth factor β. Neuromodulators shape pathogen avoidance through multiple mechanisms and targets, in agreement with the distributed neuromodulatory connectome of C. elegans.

Abstract: Summary
Control of protein stoichiometry is essential for cell function. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) presents a complex stoichiometric challenge as the ratio of the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase must be tightly controlled, and assembly requires coordinated integration of proteins encoded in the nuclear and mitochondrial genome. How correct OXPHOS stoichiometry is achieved is unknown. We identify the Mitochondrial Regulatory hub for respiratory Assembly (MiRA) platform, which synchronizes ETC and ATP synthase biogenesis in yeast. Molecularly, this is achieved by a stop-and-go mechanism: the uncharacterized protein Mra1 stalls complex IV assembly. Two “Go” signals are required for assembly progression: binding of the complex IV assembly factor Rcf2 and Mra1 interaction with an Atp9-translating mitoribosome induce Mra1 degradation, allowing synchronized maturation of complex IV and the ATP synthase. Failure of the stop-and-go mechanism results in cell death. MiRA controls OXPHOS assembly, ensuring correct stoichiometry of protein machineries encoded by two different genomes.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) shares many similarities with the spinal cord of vertebrates and has emerged as a major model for understanding the development and function of motor systems. Here, we use high-quality scRNA-seq, validated by anatomical identification, to create a comprehensive census of larval VNC cell types. We show that the neural lineages that comprise the adult VNC are already defined, but quiescent, at the larval stage. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-enriched populations, we separate all motor neuron bundles and link individual neuron clusters to morphologically characterized known subtypes. We discovered a glutamate receptor subunit required for basal neurotransmission and homeostasis at the larval neuromuscular junction. We describe larval glia and endorse the general view that glia perform consistent activities throughout development. This census represents an extensive resource and a powerful platform for future discoveries of cellular and molecular mechanisms in repair, regeneration, plasticity, homeostasis, and behavioral coordination.

Abstract: Summary
The plant cell wall is a dynamic structure that plays an essential role in development, but the mechanism regulating cell wall formation remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that two transcription factors, SlERF.H5 and SlERF.H7, control cell wall formation and tomato fruit firmness in an additive manner. Knockout of SlERF.H5, SlERF.H7, or both genes decreased cell wall thickness, firmness, and cellulose contents in fruits during early development, especially in double-knockout lines. Overexpressing either gene resulted in thicker cell walls and greater fruit firmness with elevated cellulose levels in fruits but severely dwarf plants with lower gibberellin contents. We further identified that SlERF.H5 and SlERF.H7 activate the cellulose biosynthesis gene SlCESA3 but repress the gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA20ox1. Moreover, we identified a conserved LPL motif in these ERFs responsible for their activities as transcriptional activators and repressors, providing insight into how bifunctional transcription factors modulate distinct developmental processes.

Abstract: Summary
Patterning and growth are fundamental features of embryonic development that must be tightly coordinated. To understand how metabolism impacts early mesoderm development, we used mouse embryonic stem-cell-derived gastruloids, that co-expressed glucose transporters with the mesodermal marker T/Bra. We found that the glucose mimic, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), blocked T/Bra expression and abolished axial elongation in gastruloids. However, glucose removal did not phenocopy 2-DG treatment despite a decline in glycolytic intermediates. As 2-DG can also act as a competitive inhibitor of mannose in protein glycosylation, we added mannose together with 2-DG and found that it could rescue the mesoderm specification both in vivo and in vitro. We further showed that blocking production and intracellular recycling of mannose abrogated mesoderm specification. Proteomics analysis demonstrated that mannose reversed glycosylation of the Wnt pathway regulator, secreted frizzled receptor Frzb. Our study showed how mannose controls mesoderm specification in mouse gastruloids.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide measurement of ribosome occupancy on mRNAs has enabled empirical identification of translated regions, but high-confidence detection of coding regions that overlap annotated coding regions has remained challenging. Here, we report a sensitive and robust algorithm that revealed the translation of 388 N-terminally truncated proteins in budding yeast—more than 30-fold more than previously known. We extensively experimentally validated them and defined two classes. The first class lacks large portions of the annotated protein and tends to be produced from a truncated transcript. We show that two such cases, Yap5truncation and Pus1truncation, have condition-specific regulation and distinct functions from their respective annotated isoforms. The second class of truncated protein isoforms lacks only a small region of the annotated protein and is less likely to be produced from an alternative transcript isoform. Many display different subcellular localizations than their annotated counterpart, representing a common strategy for dual localization of otherwise functionally identical proteins. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Cells remodel their cytoskeletal networks to adapt to their environment. Here, we analyze the mechanisms utilized by the cell to tailor its microtubule landscape in response to changes in osmolarity that alter macromolecular crowding. By integrating live-cell imaging, ex vivo enzymatic assays, and in vitro reconstitution, we probe the impact of cytoplasmic density on microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and tubulin posttranslational modifications (PTMs). We find that human epithelial cells respond to fluctuations in cytoplasmic density by modulating microtubule acetylation, detyrosination, or MAP7 association without differentially affecting polyglutamylation, tyrosination, or MAP4 association. These MAP-PTM combinations alter intracellular cargo transport, enabling the cell to respond to osmotic challenges. We further dissect the molecular mechanisms governing tubulin PTM specification and find that MAP7 promotes acetylation and inhibits detyrosination. Our data identify MAP7 in modulating the tubulin code, resulting in microtubule cytoskeleton remodeling and alteration of intracellular transport as an integrated mechanism of cellular adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to play key roles in learning by conveying the difference between expected and actual outcomes. Recent evidence suggests diversity in dopamine signaling, yet it remains poorly understood how heterogeneous signals might be organized to facilitate the role of downstream circuits mediating distinct aspects of behavior. Here, we investigated the organizational logic of dopaminergic signaling by recording and labeling individual midbrain dopamine neurons during associative behavior. Our findings show that reward information and behavioral parameters are not only heterogeneously encoded but also differentially distributed across populations of dopamine neurons. Retrograde tracing and fiber photometry suggest that populations of dopamine neurons projecting to different striatal regions convey distinct signals. These data, supported by computational modeling, indicate that such distributional coding can maximize dynamic range and tailor dopamine signals to facilitate specialized roles of different striatal regions.

Abstract: Summary
The basal breast cancer subtype is enriched for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and displays consistent large chromosomal deletions. Here, we characterize evolution and maintenance of chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss in basal breast cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data shows recurrent deletion of chr4p in basal breast cancer. Phylogenetic analysis of a panel of 23 primary tumor/patient-derived xenograft basal breast cancers reveals early evolution of chr4p deletion. Mechanistically we show that chr4p loss is associated with enhanced proliferation. Gene function studies identify an unknown gene, C4orf19, within chr4p, which suppresses proliferation when overexpressed—a member of the PDCD10-GCKIII kinase module we name PGCKA1. Genome-wide pooled overexpression screens using a barcoded library of human open reading frames identify chromosomal regions, including chr4p, that suppress proliferation when overexpressed in a context-dependent manner, implicating network interactions. Together, these results shed light on the early emergence of complex aneuploid karyotypes involving chr4p and adaptive landscapes shaping breast cancer genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has a global prevalence of about 25% and no approved therapy. Using metabolomic and proteomic analyses, we identified high expression of hepatic transketolase (TKT), a metabolic enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, in human and mouse MAFLD. Hyperinsulinemia promoted TKT expression through the insulin receptor-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha axis. Utilizing liver-specific TKT overexpression and knockout mouse models, we demonstrated that TKT was sufficient and required for MAFLD progression. Further metabolic flux analysis revealed that Tkt deletion increased hepatic inosine levels to activate the protein kinase A-cAMP response element binding protein cascade, promote phosphatidylcholine synthesis, and improve mitochondrial function. Moreover, insulin induced hepatic TKT to limit inosine-dependent mitochondrial activity. Importantly, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-siRNA conjugates targeting hepatic TKT showed promising therapeutic effects on mouse MAFLD. Our study uncovers how hyperinsulinemia regulates TKT-orchestrated inosine metabolism and mitochondrial function and provides a novel therapeutic strategy for MAFLD prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are central innate immune cells whose function declines with age. The molecular mechanisms underlying age-related changes remain poorly understood, particularly in human macrophages. We report a substantial reduction in phagocytosis, migration, and chemotaxis in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from older (>50 years old) compared with younger (18–30 years old) donors, alongside downregulation of transcription factors MYC and USF1. In MDMs from young donors, knockdown of MYC or USF1 decreases phagocytosis and chemotaxis and alters the expression of associated genes, alongside adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling. A concordant dysregulation of MYC and USF1 target genes is also seen in MDMs from older donors. Furthermore, older age and loss of either MYC or USF1 in MDMs leads to an increased cell size, altered morphology, and reduced actin content. Together, these results define MYC and USF1 as key drivers of MDM age-related functional decline and identify downstream targets to improve macrophage function in aging.

Abstract: Summary
How a protein’s function influences the shape of its fitness landscape, smooth or rugged, is a fundamental question in evolutionary biochemistry. Smooth landscapes arise when incremental mutational steps lead to a progressive change in function, as commonly seen in enzymes and binding proteins. On the other hand, rugged landscapes are poorly understood because of the inherent unpredictability of how sequence changes affect function. Here, we experimentally characterize the entire sequence phylogeny, comprising 1,158 extant and ancestral sequences, of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the LacI/GalR transcriptional repressor family. Our analysis revealed an extremely rugged landscape with rapid switching of specificity, even between adjacent nodes. Further, the ruggedness arises due to the necessity of the repressor to simultaneously evolve specificity for asymmetric operators and disfavors potentially adverse regulatory crosstalk. Our study provides fundamental insight into evolutionary, molecular, and biophysical rules of genetic regulation through the lens of fitness landscapes.

Abstract: Summary
Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a master transcriptional regulator of the integrated stress response, leading cells toward adaptation or death. ATF4’s induction under stress was thought to be due to delayed translation reinitiation, where the reinitiation-permissive upstream open reading frame 1 (uORF1) plays a key role. Accumulating evidence challenging this mechanism as the sole source of ATF4 translation control prompted us to investigate additional regulatory routes. We identified a highly conserved stem-loop in the uORF2/ATF4 overlap, immediately preceded by a near-cognate CUG, which introduces another layer of regulation in the form of ribosome queuing. These elements explain how the inhibitory uORF2 can be translated under stress, confirming prior observations but contradicting the original regulatory model. We also identified two highly conserved, potentially modified adenines performing antagonistic roles. Finally, we demonstrated that the canonical ATF4 translation start site is substantially leaky scanned. Thus, ATF4’s translational control is more complex than originally described, underpinning its key role in diverse biological processes.

Abstract: Summary
mRNAs continually change their protein partners throughout their lifetimes, yet our understanding of mRNA-protein complex (mRNP) remodeling is limited by a lack of temporal data. Here, we present time-resolved mRNA interactome data by performing pulse metabolic labeling with photoactivatable ribonucleoside in human cells, UVA crosslinking, poly(A)+ RNA isolation, and mass spectrometry. This longitudinal approach allowed the quantification of over 700 RNA binding proteins (RBPs) across ten time points. Overall, the sequential order of mRNA binding aligns well with known functions, subcellular locations, and molecular interactions. However, we also observed RBPs with unexpected dynamics: the transcription-export (TREX) complex recruited posttranscriptionally after nuclear export factor 1 (NXF1) binding, challenging the current view of transcription-coupled mRNA export, and stress granule proteins prevalent in aged mRNPs, indicating roles in late stages of the mRNA life cycle. To systematically identify mRBPs with unknown functions, we employed machine learning to compare mRNA binding dynamics with Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. Our data can be explored at chronology.rna.snu.ac.kr.

Abstract: Summary
Sorghum bicolor is among the most important cereals globally and a staple crop for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 20% of sorghum yield is lost annually in Africa due to infestation with the root parasitic weed Striga hermonthica. Existing Striga management strategies are not singularly effective and integrated approaches are needed. Here, we demonstrate the functional potential of the soil microbiome to suppress Striga infection in sorghum. We associate this suppression with microbiome-mediated induction of root endodermal suberization and aerenchyma formation and with depletion of haustorium-inducing factors, compounds required for the initial stages of Striga infection. We further identify specific bacterial taxa that trigger the observed Striga-suppressive traits. Collectively, our study describes the importance of the soil microbiome in the early stages of root infection by Striga and pinpoints mechanisms of Striga suppression. These findings open avenues to broaden the effectiveness of integrated Striga management practices.

Abstract: Summary
We identify a senescence restriction point (SeRP) as a critical event for cells to commit to senescence. The SeRP integrates the intensity and duration of oncogenic stress, keeps a memory of previous stresses, and combines oncogenic signals acting on different pathways by modulating chromatin accessibility. Chromatin regions opened upon commitment to senescence are enriched in nucleolar-associated domains, which are gene-poor regions enriched in repeated sequences. Once committed to senescence, cells no longer depend on the initial stress signal and exhibit a characteristic transcriptome regulated by a transcription factor network that includes ETV4, RUNX1, OCT1, and MAFB. Consistent with a tumor suppressor role for this network, the levels of ETV4 and RUNX1 are very high in benign lesions of the pancreas but decrease dramatically in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. The discovery of senescence commitment and its chromatin-linked regulation suggests potential strategies for reinstating tumor suppression in human cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin is packaged into secretory granules that depart the Golgi and undergo a maturation process that involves changes in the protein and lipid composition of the granules. Here, we show that insulin secretory granules form physical contacts with the endoplasmic reticulum and that the lipid exchange protein oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is recruited to these sites in a Ca2+-dependent manner. OSBP binding to insulin granules is positively regulated by phosphatidylinositol-4 (PI4)-kinases and negatively regulated by the PI4 phosphate (PI(4)P) phosphatase Sac2. Loss of Sac2 results in excess accumulation of cholesterol on insulin granules that is normalized when OSBP expression is reduced, and both acute inhibition and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of OSBP suppress glucose-stimulated insulin secretion without affecting insulin production or intracellular Ca2+ signaling. In conclusion, we show that lipid exchange at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-granule contact sites is involved in the exocytic process and propose that these contacts act as reaction centers with multimodal functions during insulin granule maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate conversion is associated with extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs) and architectural changes of sub-organelles, yet how these events are interconnected remains unknown. We report here the identification of a phosphorylation code in 14-3-3 binding motifs (PC14-3-3) that greatly stimulates induced cardiomyocyte (iCM) formation from fibroblasts. PC14-3-3 is identified in pivotal functional proteins for iCM reprogramming, including transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Akt1 kinase and protein phosphatase 2A are the key writer and key eraser of the PC14-3-3 code, respectively. PC14-3-3 activation induces iCM formation with the presence of only Tbx5. In contrast, PC14-3-3 inhibition by mutagenesis or inhibitor-mediated code removal abolishes reprogramming. We discover that key PC14-3-3-embedded factors, such as histone deacetylase 4 (Hdac4), Mef2c, and Foxo1, form Hdac4-organized inhibitory nuclear condensates. PC14-3-3 activation disrupts Hdac4 condensates to promote cardiac gene expression. Our study suggests that sub-organelle dynamics regulated by a PTM code could be a general mechanism for stimulating cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
The dysfunction of matriptase, a membrane-anchored protease, is highly related to the progression of skin and breast cancers. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced matriptase activation and cancer invasion are known but with obscure mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate a vesicular-trafficking-mediated interplay between matriptase and EGF signaling in cancer promotion. We found that EGF induces matriptase to undergo endocytosis together with the EGF receptor, followed by acid-induced activation in endosomes. Activated matriptase is then secreted extracellularly on exosomes to catalyze hepatocyte growth factor precursor (pro-HGF) cleavage, resulting in autocrine HGF/c-Met signaling. Matriptase-induced HGF/c-Met signaling represents the second signal wave of EGF, which promotes cancer cell scattering, migration, and invasion. These findings demonstrate a role of vesicular trafficking in efficient activation and secretion of membrane matriptase and a reciprocal regulation of matriptase and EGF signaling in cancer promotion, providing insights into the physiological functions of vesicular trafficking and the molecular pathological mechanisms of skin and breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in aging and Alzheimer’s disease brains is considered a pathological phenomenon with unresolved cellular and molecular mechanisms. Utilizing stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, we observed significant in situ LD accumulation in microglia of tauopathy mouse brains. SRS imaging, combined with deuterium oxide (D2O) labeling, revealed heightened lipogenesis and impaired lipid turnover within LDs in tauopathy fly brains and human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Transfer of unsaturated lipids from tauopathy iPSC neurons to microglia induced LD accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired phagocytosis. Neuronal AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibits lipogenesis and promotes lipophagy in neurons, thereby reducing lipid flux to microglia. AMPK depletion in prodromal tauopathy mice increased LD accumulation, exacerbated pro-inflammatory microgliosis, and promoted neuropathology. Our findings provide direct evidence of native, aberrant LD accumulation in tauopathy brains and underscore the critical role of AMPK in regulating brain lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Leptin resistance during excess weight gain significantly contributes to the recidivism of obesity to leptin-based pharmacological therapies. The mechanisms underlying the inhibition of leptin receptor (LepR) signaling during obesity are still elusive. Here, we report that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) interacts with LepR, reducing the latter’s activity, and that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity disrupts this interaction and augments leptin signaling. Treatment of diet-induced obese mice with blood-brain barrier (BBB)-permeable HDAC6 inhibitors profoundly reduces food intake and leads to potent weight loss without affecting the muscle mass. Genetic depletion of Hdac6 in Agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons or administration with BBB-impermeable HDAC6 inhibitors results in a lack of such anti-obesity effect. Together, these findings represent the first report describing a mechanistically validated and pharmaceutically tractable therapeutic approach to directly increase LepR activity as well as identifying centrally but not peripherally acting HDAC6 inhibitors as potent leptin sensitizers and anti-obesity agents.

Abstract: Summary
The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I)-mediated tumor antigen processing and presentation (APP) pathway is essential for the recruitment and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ CTLs). However, this pathway is frequently dysregulated in many cancers, thus leading to a failure of immunotherapy. Here, we report that activation of the tumor-intrinsic Hippo pathway positively correlates with the expression of MHC class I APP genes and the abundance of CD8+ CTLs in mouse tumors and patients. Blocking the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein/transcriptional enhanced associate domain (YAP/TEAD) potently improves antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the YAP/TEAD complex cooperates with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex to repress NLRC5 transcription. The upregulation of NLRC5 by YAP/TEAD depletion or pharmacological inhibition increases the expression of MHC class I APP genes and enhances CD8+ CTL-mediated killing of cancer cells. Collectively, our results suggest a crucial tumor-promoting function of YAP depending on NLRC5 to impair the MHC class I APP pathway and provide a rationale for inhibiting YAP activity in immunotherapy for cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Receptors controlling the cross-presentation of tumor antigens by macrophage subsets in cancer tissues are poorly explored. Here, we show that TIM4+ large peritoneal macrophages efficiently capture and cross-present tumor-associated antigens at early stages of peritoneal infiltration by ovarian cancer cells. The phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor TIM4 promotes maximal uptake of dead cells or PS-coated artificial targets and triggers inflammatory and metabolic gene programs in combination with cytoskeletal remodeling and upregulation of transcriptional signatures related to antigen processing. At the cellular level, TIM4-mediated engulfment induces nucleation of F-actin around nascent phagosomes, delaying the recruitment of vacuolar ATPase, acidification, and cargo degradation. In vivo, TIM4 deletion blunts induction of early anti-tumoral effector CD8 T cells and accelerates the progression of ovarian tumors. We conclude that TIM4-mediated uptake drives the formation of specialized phagosomes that prolong the integrity of ingested antigens and facilitate cross-presentation, contributing to immune surveillance of the peritoneum.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), as key regulators of mRNA fate, are abundantly expressed in the testis. However, RBPs associated with human male infertility remain largely unknown. Through bioinformatic analyses, we identified 62 such RBPs, including an evolutionarily conserved RBP, DEAD-box helicase 20 (DDX20). Male germ-cell-specific inactivation of Ddx20 at E15.5 caused T1-propsermatogonia (T1-ProSG) to fail to reenter cell cycle during the first week of testicular development in mice. Consequently, neither the foundational spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) pool nor progenitor spermatogonia were ever formed in the knockout testes. Mechanistically, DDX20 functions to control the translation of its target mRNAs, many of which encode cell-cycle-related regulators, by interacting with key components of the translational machinery in prospermatogonia. Our data demonstrate a previously unreported function of DDX20 as a translational regulator of critical cell-cycle-related genes, which is essential for cell-cycle reentry of T1-ProSG and formation of the SSC pool.

Abstract: Summary
With limited treatment options, cachexia remains a major challenge for patients with cancer. Characterizing the interplay between tumor cells and the immune microenvironment may help identify potential therapeutic targets for cancer cachexia. Herein, we investigate the critical role of macrophages in potentiating pancreatic cancer induced muscle wasting via promoting TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis) secretion from the tumor. Specifically, depletion of macrophages reverses muscle degradation induced by tumor cells. Macrophages induce non-autonomous secretion of TWEAK through CCL5/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. TWEAK promotes muscle atrophy by activating MuRF1 initiated muscle remodeling. Notably, tumor cells recruit and reprogram macrophages via the CCL2/CCR2 axis and disrupting the interplay between macrophages and tumor cells attenuates muscle wasting. Collectively, this study identifies a feedforward loop between pancreatic cancer cells and macrophages, underlying the non-autonomous activation of TWEAK secretion from tumor cells thereby providing promising therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer cachexia.
