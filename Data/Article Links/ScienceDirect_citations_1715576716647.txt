Abstract: Ag nanoparticles are commonly used for phase change material (PCM) modification to improve the photo-thermal convertibility in composite phase change materials (CPCM) owing to enhance carrier's ability to absorb photons by virtue of its unique localized Surface Plasmon Resonance effect (LSPR). Currently, redox method is considered to be the most effective method for the preparation of Ag nano-coating. However, it is still challenging to obtain a dense and uniform Ag nano-coating on the carrier surface due to the difference in the binding force between Ag nanoparticles and different carriers. Herein, a new preparation strategy is demonstrated, in which the carrier is pre-modified by adding a polydopamine (PDA) coating to enhance the bonding between the carrier and the silver nanoparticles, and then a stable three-dimensional silver nano-conducting network is obtained by redox. Consequential stable architecture contributes to polyethylene glycol (PEG) loadings reach 98%, simultaneously with an ultra-high photo-thermal conversion efficiency of 97.9%. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the effect of carbonization temperature on the flexibility of melamine carbon foam (CMF), and different nano-Ag concentrations on the thermal conductivity of CPCM. This finding provides valuable guidance for the engineering of high photo-thermal conversion performance CPCM and strengthens their practical implementation in solar energy storage and thermal management.

Abstract: Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are promising materials to increase the storage capacity of solar energy-based systems, such as Salt Gradient Solar Ponds (SGSPs), as they are characterized by a large latent heat during the solid-liquid phase change. This paper introduces an optimization study for PCM integration in SGSP, in terms of PCM mass ratio (14 %, 19 %, 28 % and 47 %) in the lower convective zone and PCM melting temperature (35 °C, 44 °C and 50 °C). Numerically, a 2D model is developed, consisting in the continuity equation as well on momentum, thermal energy and diffusion equations. In order to validate this numerical model, an experimental campaign of a parallelepiped SGSP with PCM capsules in the bottom is constructed. The latter is tested for two PCMs (RT35HC and RT44HC) and under different climatic conditions of March and June. Numerical and experimental have been compared in which the maximum average relative error does not exceed 4.62 %, which ensures a positive validation. The optimization returns that the final liquid fraction of PCM decreases both increasing the mass ratio and melting temperature. Higher mass ratios reduce the final temperature of the PCM (49.5 °C with 14 % and 42 °C with 47 % for RT35HC), and also with higher melting temperatures reduce the thermal energy stored, since the pond tends to work only as a sensible energy storage system.

Abstract: The application of phase change materials (PCMs) to improve the efficiency of solar energy has been widely studied. However, most composite PCMs can only maintain high photothermal conversion performance in solid phase environment. To expand the application range of PCM in solar energy field, a flexible composite film which can stably exist in both solid and aqueous environments was prepared. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the temperature control core, hydroxyl boron nitride nanosheets (HO-BNNS) and carboxy-rich carbon (RHTC) as the thermally conductive filler and high photothermal converter, respectively, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the flexible supporting material. RHTC/HO-BNNS, as a key bridge, forms a thermal conductivity and photothermal conversion network in the composite film, making its photothermal conversion storage efficiency up to 92.1%, and its thermal conductivity 4 times higher than that of pure PEG. Together with the excellent mechanical strength (2.35 MPa), composite film can be operate at night solar evaporators. It can both improve the effective utilization of solar energy and accelerate the progress of seawater desalination, providing a new idea for expanding the application of PCM.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel phase change microcapsules (MPN@PA) with metal-polyphenol (MPN) as shell material and paraffin (PA) as core material were prepared by interfacial self-assembly method. It has low preparation cost and shows excellent photothermal conversion and heat storage properties. The highest encapsulation rate of MPN@PA without leakage is 59.58% when the shell-core ration is 1.0:1.5. The morphology of MPN@PA is quasi-spheroid with the size of about 10∼26 μm. FT-IR and XRD analysis results show that MPN and PA are combined by hydrogen bonding, and no new substance is formed. The enthalpy of phase transformation of MPN@PA (1.0:1.5) is 140.9 J/g. Moreover, MPN@PA has excellent thermal stability, thermal reliability, photothermal conversion and heat storage efficiency (71.47%–73.31%). The prepared novel photothermal transformation microcapsule is expected to be applied to the high-efficiency storage, management and utilization of solar energy.

Abstract: Colon cancer has become a global public health challenge, and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) chemoresistance is a major obstacle in its treatment. Chemoresistance can be mediated by therapy-induced cellular senescence. This study intended to investigate mechanisms of INHBA (inhibin A) in 5-FU resistance mediated by cellular senescence in colon cancer. Bioinformatics analysis of INHBA expression in colon cancer tissues, survival analysis, and correlation analysis of cellular senescence markers were performed. The effects of INHBA on the biological characteristics and 5-FU resistance of colon cancer cells were examined through loss/gain-of-function and molecular assays. Finally, a xenograft mouse model was built to validate the mechanism of INHBA in vivo. INHBA was upregulated in colon cancer and was significantly positively correlated with cellular senescence markers uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), dense and erect panicle 1 (DEP1), and p21. Cellular senescence in colon cancer mediated 5-FU resistance. Downregulation of INHBA expression enhanced 5-FU sensitivity in colon cancer cells, inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, increased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase, and it resulted in a lower proportion of senescent cells and lower levels of the cellular senescence markers interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8). Analysis of whether to use the pathway inhibitor Verteporfin proved that INHBA facilitated colon cancer cell senescence and enhanced 5-FU chemoresistance via inactivation of Hippo signaling pathway, and consistent results were obtained in vivo. Collectively, INHBA conferred 5-FU chemoresistance mediated by cellular senescence in colon cancer cells through negative regulation of Hippo signaling.

Abstract: Yes-associated protein (YAP)—a major effector protein of the Hippo pathway— regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence. Amp-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor that monitors cellular nutrient supply and energy status. Although YAP and AMPK are considered to regulate cellular senescence, it is still unclear whether AMPK is involved in YAP-regulated cellular senescence. Here, we found that YAP promoted AMPKα1 aggregation and localization around mitochondria by co-transfecting CFP-YAP and YFP-AMPKα1 plasmids. Subsequent live cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay did not exhibit direct interaction between YAP and AMPKα1. FRET, Co-immunoprecipitation, and western blot experiments revealed that YAP directly bound to TEAD, enhancing the expression of AMPKα1 and p-AMPKα. Treatment with verteporfin inhibited YAP’s binding to TEAD and reversed the elevated expression of AMPKα1 in the cells overexpressing CFP-YAP. Verteporfin also reduced the proportion of AMPKα1 puncta in the cells co-expressing CFP-YAP and YFP-AMPKα1. In addition, the AMPKα1 puncta were demonstrated to inhibit cell viability, autophagy, and proliferation, and ultimately promote cell senescence. In conclusion, YAP binds to TEAD to upregulate AMPKα1 and promotes the formation of AMPKα1 puncta around mitochondria under the condition of co-expression of CFP-YAP and YFP-AMPKα1, in which AMPKα1 puncta lead to cellular senescence.

Abstract: Molten salt has been extensively applied as a medium for heat transfer and thermal energy storage. In this work, a novel quinary nitrate/nitrite mixed molten salt is developed and its comprehensive thermophysical properties, thermal stability, sensible thermal energy storage density and economics are evaluated. Based on the thermal analysis method, the melting point and decomposition temperature of the NaNO3–KNO3–Ca(NO3)2–NaNO2–KNO2 system are determined at 102.3 °C and 651.2 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the specific heat capacity, density and thermal conductivity of the quinary molten salt are measured using specific apparatus with satisfactory results. It is noteworthy that after long-term high temperature test and multiple heating-cooling cycle tests, the change rate of the various thermophysical properties of the quinary molten salt is all less than 10%, exhibiting excellent thermal stability. The sensible thermal energy storage density of the quinary molten salt is 743.7 kJ/kg, and the sensible thermal energy storage cost is 17.2 RMB/(kW·h). Eventually, the proposed molten salt has the advantages of the wide liquid operating temperature range, high sensible thermal energy storage density and better thermal performance, which can be widely used as an excellent heat transfer and storage material for thermal energy storage systems.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are a crucial focus of research in the field of photothermal energy storage. However, due to their inherently low photothermal conversion efficiency, traditional PCMs absorb solar energy scarcely. The photothermal conversion ability of PCMs are usually enhanced by incorporating photothermal conversion nanoparticles. Polydopamine (PDA) is widely used in various fields due to its excellent photothermal conversion and adhesion performance. We dispersed PDA into PEG containing CuNPs to test the effect of PDA on thermal properties of cPCMs. Our team has conducted experiments to test the thermal characteristics and photothermal conversion ability of cPCMs. Results demonstrated that the addition of PDA mitigated the enthalpy loss caused by integrating CuNPs. The enthalpy of melting of cPCMs with addition of polydopamine is greater than that without polydopamine for the composites with different mass fractions. The addition of PDA in cPCMs enhanced their photothermal conversion capacity, resulting in higher temperatures being achieved within the same exposure time compared to samples without PDA. Therefore, the cPCMs with dispersed polydopamine can store higher energy. Meanwhile, PDA also improved the overall thermal conductivity of the material. Our work provided a new method to utilize the photothermal properties of polydopamine. Meanwhile, it can reduce the cost of photothermal energy storage PCMs and further improve the potential of PCM energy storage.

Abstract: The nickel oxide (NiOx) film is often employed as a hole transport layer for the production of high-performance inverted perovskite solar cells due to its exceptional chemical stability, high hole mobility, and matching energy level structure. Among various techniques for preparing NiOx, E-beam evaporation-based NiOx films show great promise owing to their low fabrication temperature and excellent photoelectric properties. Herein, an ion bombardment source was used to generate oxygen plasma through the bombardment of oxygen molecules, which subsequently oxidized the non-stoichiometric NiOx. Experimental findings demonstrate that this method substantially enhances the electrical and optical properties of the NiOx film. We utilized a room-temperature-processed NiOx film as a hole transport layer to fabricate inverted wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, resulting in a champion device efficiency of 17.82%. It is anticipated that the NiOx films produced via this approach will be widely adopted in the industrialization of perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the foremost contributor to global mortality, presenting a complex etiology and an expanding array of risk factors. Coronary artery disease characterized by atherosclerotic plaque build-up in the coronary arteries, imposes significant mortality and financial burdens, especially in low- and middle-income nations. The pathogenesis of coronary artery disease involves a multifaceted interplay of genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. Epigenetic regulation contributes to the dynamic control of gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. The mounting evidence that highlights the pivotal role of epigenetic regulation in coronary artery disease development and progression, offering potential avenues for the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Abnormal DNA methylation patterns are linked to the modulation of gene expression involved in crucial processes like lipid metabolism, inflammation, and vascular function in the context of coronary artery disease. Cell-free DNA has become invaluable in tumor biology as a liquid biopsy, while its applications in coronary artery disease are limited, but intriguing. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture causes myocardial infarction, by depriving heart muscles of oxygen, releasing cell-free DNA from dead cardiac cells, and providing a minimally invasive source to explore tissue-specific epigenetic alterations. We discussed the methodologies for studying the global methylome and hydroxy-methylome landscape, their advantages, and limitations. It explores methylome alterations in coronary artery disease, considering risk factors and their relevance in coronary artery disease genesis. The review also details the implications of MI-derived cell-free DNA for developing minimally invasive biomarkers and associated challenges.

Abstract: Thermochemical heat storage technology is a highly promising one, with high heat storage density and the ability to store heat across seasons. Thermochemical heat storage materials are mainly solid powders, which usually have a low heat transfer coefficient, a wide particle size distribution and poor mobility. Hence, their application in fixed-bed as well as fluidized-bed reactors is difficult. In this paper, core shell structure (CSS) pellets were prepared with silicon carbide as shell and Ca(OH)2 as core. The pellets were of uniform size, stable in shape and have good cyclic stability. The experimental validation and simulation of the heat storage properties and mechanical strength of the prepared pellets were carried out. The experimental results show that after 25 cycles of heat storage and release, the heat storage density of the pellet decreases within 20% and no cracking or crushing occurs. The simulation results show that the shell structure parameters affect both the heat storage performance and the mechanical strength of the pellets. In this paper, the shell structure parameters are optimized through simulations, which provide a reference for the preparation of CSS pellets.

Abstract: Investigations on development of new renewable phase change materials are important studies to increase the number of available materials for thermal utilization. In this sense, the diesters of sebacic acid (decandioic acid) have been synthesized and characterized for thermal applications. They include the diesters of 1-decanol, 1-dodecanol and 1-hexadecanol with decandioic acid. They have been specifically investigated for their thermo-physical properties to draw attention to their possible use in applications. Fourier transform infrared, gas chromatography mass spectrometry and elemental analyses were carried out for chemical characterization of the resultant structures. With the aid of the differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetric analyzer, detailed thermal properties, including phase change temperatures, specific heat and enthalpy values, thermal decomposition and thermal reliability, have been reported with related statistical calculations. The differential scanning calorimeter data showed that the melting onset temperature points of the diesters are between 30 °C and 58 °C and they have enthalpy higher than 185 kJ/kg, which are appropriate for thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) materials driven by calcium looping (CaL) have great potential to be used in the next generation of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. However, natural calcium-based materials are easily sintered at high temperatures, and their optical absorption capacities are too low to be directly utilized. To overcome these challenges, Mn and Al co-modified CaO-based composites were developed by the sol-gel method in this work, and three kinds of precursors (calcium acetate, calcium gluconate, and calcium nitrate) were chosen as calcium sources. Considering the energy storage density and the average solar absorption ability, the appropriate doping ratio was determined to be Ca: Mn: Al = 100: 8: 8. In different calcium precursors, the sample fabricated from calcium gluconate forms a stable skeleton and keeps a porous structure during cycles, and its average optical absorption reaches 86.14%. The conversion rate of CaO is maintained at 91.50% over 60 cycles, while that of pure CaO prepared by commercial CaCO3 is only 16.93%. The effect of Mn and Al on the carbonation stage was analyzed by density functional theory (DFT). The CO2 adsorption energies of the perfect CaO surface and the defective CaO surface co-doped with Mn and Al were calculated. It is found that the defective surface is easier to combine with CO2, and the generated C-O bond is strengthened. This work develops a doping strategy for outstanding CaO-based composites and explores the physical mechanism of doping elements for enhancing CaO capability from the microscopic aspect.

Abstract: A method to increase the module efficiency, is the separation of silicon solar cells prior to interconnection. The lower currents per cell lead to lower string currents and less resistive losses. This is also the case in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell and module technology. One of the methods to separate is by laser scribing and mechanical cleaving (LSMC). It was known that not mechanical cleaving but laser scribing is a major source of losses during the solar cell separation process. Therefore, the SHJ solar cell separation optimization should focus on the laser scribing process to pursue better performance. Most reported works employed experiments to study the laser scribing influence on solar cell performance, but unfortunately, they suffer from expensive devices, complicated operations, and accuracy uncertainty. To our knowledge, we first designed a finite element model of femtosecond laser scribing on the SHJ solar cells. This numerical model has been proven by experiments and shows its function in numerically evaluating the solar cell performance during laser scribing. Based on the model, we analyze the reasons for the effect of femtosecond laser scribing on the performance of solar cell and explain the phenomenon of a significant reduction in short-circuit current density (Jsc). Therefore, our numerical femtosecond laser scribing model can be a useful guide for SHJ solar cell separation.

Abstract: The issues of inherent low thermal conductivity, slow heat transport rate and easy leakage are critical challenges for accelerating solar-thermal energy harvesting and storage for organic solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs). Aerogel carriers with thermal conductivity enhancement based on ice temple methods show favorable potential for PCMs solar thermal applications. Comparing with disordered and unidirectional freezing, bidirectional freezing can assemble efficiently in multiple dimensions and result in long-range ordered structures. In this paper, bacterial cellulose/polyvinyl alcohol/MXene aerogels were constructed by bidirectional freezing. The anisotropic PCMs composites were from vacuum impregnation PEG into aerogel networks. By controlling crystallization and growth of ice crystals through the dual temperature gradients, the PCMs composites obtained enhanced heat transfer efficiency in horizontal and vertical directions. Bidirectional aligned PCMs with PDMS wedge angle of 0° and 20° exhibit high thermal conductivity of 0.716 W m−1 K−1 and 0.768 W m−1 K−1, which were 184% higher than that of PEG, and photothermal conversion efficiency of 55.17% and 76.91%. Remarkably, the PCMs composites with a 20° PDMS wedge angle also exhibited a high PCM loading capacity (96.3%) and a high enthalpy (157.7 J/g). The results show that bidirectional anisotropic PCMs composites have excellent overall performance and are expected to improve solar thermal application.

Abstract: Exploiting Janus monolayers in constructing two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has emerged as an effective strategy for designing highly efficient optoelectronic devices. In this paper, using first-principles calculations, we explore the stability, structural, and electronic properties of Janus XMoSiP2/BAs (X = S, Se) heterostructures in twelve possible stackings. It is shown that all twenty-four studied heterostructures are energetically stable and twenty of them possess type-II band alignment which helps the dissociation of photo-generated carriers in solar cell devices. The electronic bandstructures reveal that some stackings of XMoSiP2/BAs vdW heterostructures own proper bandgaps for maximum solar light absorption. In addition, very high carrier mobilities (up to 83000 cm2 V−1 s−1), as well as strong visible light absorption coefficients (up to 2 × 105 cm−1) are other features that suggest XMoSiP2/BAs heterostructures as promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. It is also found that the -P stackings of XMoSiP2/BAs, the configurations in which the outer P atom of XMoSiP2 faces the BAs monolayer, have high power conversion efficiency (PCE) owing to the minimal conduction band offset between their constituent monolayer. Finally, two stackings of XMoSiP2/BAs heterostructures are predicted to have excellent PCEs beyond 23% which exceeds the PCEs of many other 2D vdW heterostructures studied previously. We believe that our findings can pave the way to accomplish high-efficiency optoelectronic devices based on 2D vdW heterostructures.

Abstract: The efficient utilization of solar energy requires advanced heat storage technology, while phase change heat storage materials cannot utilize their high-density latent heat storage performance due to defects such as poor light absorption and leakage. To address these deficiencies, here, shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) of polyethylene glycol (PEG) encapsulated by polypyrrole (PPy) aerogel were prepared through chemical polymerization and physical infiltration methods. Particularly, our findings demonstrated that PPy aerogel simultaneously enhances the shape stability and improves the solar-thermal conversion efficiency of PEG. The developed SSPCMs have a melting enthalpy of 142.4 J/g and 86% solar-thermal conversion efficiency. SSPCMs can maintain a stable shape, enthalpy value, and heat release time after 100 cycles. When used as a solar-thermal conversion material in a solar thermoelectric power generation system and thermal therapy, a long-term stable output voltage of 318 mV and temperature of 40–50 °C are generated, respectively, achieving effective conversion from renewable solar energy to applicable electricity and heat energy. This work may pave an effective way for the integrated design of encapsulating materials and light-absorbing materials in SSPCMs.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer a promising avenue for renewable energy due to their ease of preparation, high energy conversion efficiency, and environmental friendliness. However, the traditional trial-and-error approach in preparing high-efficiency PSCs is inefficient. To address this, our study introduces a goal-driven approach that integrates machine learning and data mining techniques to rapidly screen high-efficiency PSCs based on key features. By successfully predicting high-efficiency PSCs and identifying the dominant factors affecting their performance, namely the perovskite bandgap and the total thickness of the electron transport layer (ETL), this research provides valuable insights for optimizing preparation processes and advancing the development of high-efficiency PSCs, thus significantly contributing to the renewable energy sector.

Abstract: Previous experimental studies have found that nanoparticle TiO2 doping into molten salts can mitigate the corrosive effect of molten salts on metals; however, the microscopic mechanism behind this phenomenon has not been fully understood. In this paper, the diffusion characteristics and microstructural features of the interface between nanoparticle TiO2 and metal Fe at high temperatures were simulated by molecular dynamics (MD) method, and an attempt was made to explain the corrosion inhibition mechanism from the microscopic point of view. The results show that when the temperature ranges from 698 to 1298 K, TiO2 and Fe behave in a mutual diffusion way at the interface, where a stable diffusion layer has been formed gradually. As the temperature rises, the diffusion intensifies and the diffusion layer becomes thicker. Moreover, an energy gradient is built up at the interface, indicating that the atoms that are closer to the interface have larger energies. The binding energy at the TiO2/Fe interface increases with the increasing of temperature, and its makes the atoms at the interface undergo the diffusion-remodeling behavior and form new coordination compounds: Ti2Fe, TiFe2, TiFe4, Ti(FeO2)3, Ti8Fe35O64, FeO, etc. This is in general agreement with the observations in experiments.

Abstract: The issue of leakage in phase change materials (PCMs) severely restricts their use as thermal storage materials. In this study, waste coffee grounds-based biochar (WCG) was developed by carbonization and chemical modification as a support material for composite PCMs. The WCG/Paraffin wax (PW) composite PCMs were prepared using the melt impregnation method. The pore structure of alkali-modified biochar (OH-WCG) underwent significant development, and the surface area and total pore volume increased to 21.9 and 12 times that of unmodified biochar, respectively. Leak-free composite PCMs (OH-WCG-40) can be obtained when using OH-WCG as the support material at a biochar addition of 40 wt%. The characterization results indicated the physicochemical compatibility of the biochar in the composite PCMs with the PCMs. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed the phase transition temperature and the melting enthalpy of OH-WCG-40 were 46.28 °C and 97.69 J/g, respectively. The thermal conductivity of OH-WCG-40 was enhanced by 43% compared to pure PW. After 300 cycles, the composite PCMs exhibited nearly no change in mass and demonstrated good cycling stability. Therefore, alkali-modified biochar is a good support material for composite PCMs which can be used as a good thermoregulation material for temperature regulation of buildings and recycling of solar energy.

Abstract: Given the high concentration of iron in the micro-environment of ovarian endometriosis, it is plausible to hypothesize that ectopic endometrial cells may be more susceptible to undergoing ferroptosis. Manipulation of ferroptosis has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat related diseases. In this study, we examined the impact on ectopic endometrial stromal cells (EESCs) of iron overload and an inducer of ferroptosis. We found that the iron concentration in the ovarian endometriosis was much higher than control samples. Treatment of cultured EESCs with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) increase the sensitivity to undergo ferroptosis. By analyzing the RNA-seq results, it was discovered that zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) was significantly downregulated in ferroptosis induced EESCs. Moreover, overexpression of EZH2 effectively prevented the induction of ferroptosis. In addition, the activity or expression of EZH2 is directly and specifically inhibited by the methyltransferase inhibitor GSK343, which raises the sensitivity of stromal cells to ferroptosis. Taken together, our findings revealed that EZH2 act as a suppressor in the induced cell ferroptosis through a PRC2-independent methyltransferase mechanism. Therefore, blocking EZH2 expression and inducing ferroptosis may be effective treatment approaches for ovarian endometriosis.

Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) stands out as a promising light-absorbing material known for its non-toxic nature, excellent stability, earth's abundance, and outstanding optoelectronic performance. However, the surface quality of Sb2Se3 thin films is an important factor limiting the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells. This article presents a novel approach employing the environmentally friendly and cost-effective inorganic salt, antimony trichloride (SbCl3), to passivate the surface of Sb2Se3 thin films, thus improving the performance of Sb2Se3 solar cells. The influence of SbCl3 passivation on the surface quality of Sb2Se3 thin films and the underlying physical mechanisms behind the enhancement of Sb2Se3 solar cell performance have been investigated. SbCl3 passivation can effectively fill the voids between Sb2Se3 grains, reduce the surface roughness, and decrease the leakage current of the solar cells. Furthermore, it enhances the light response of the device in the long-wavelength region, reduces the open-circuit voltage losses, effectively lowers the interface recombination rate of charge carriers, and improves carrier transport. As a result of this innovative approach, the efficiency of 6.74% has been recorded. This work provides valuable references for future back contact interface passivation of Sb2Se3 solar cells.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a significant challenge for public healthcare systems in developed Western countries including the USA, Canada, and the UK, is influenced by different risk factors including hepatitis virus infections, alcoholism, and smoking. The disruption in the balance of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a vital function in tumorigenesis, given their function as regulators in numerous signaling networks. These miRNAs, which are mature and active in the cytoplasm, work by reducing the expression of target genes through their impact on mRNAs. MiRNAs are particularly significant in HCC as they regulate key aspects of the tumor, like proliferation and invasion. Additionally, during treatment phases such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the levels of miRNAs are key determinants. Pre-clinical experiments have demonstrated that altered miRNA expression contributes to HCC development, metastasis, drug resistance, and radio-resistance, highlighting related molecular pathways and processes like MMPs, EMT, apoptosis, and autophagy. Furthermore, the regulatory role of miRNAs in HCC extends beyond their immediate function, as they are also influenced by other epigenetic factors like lncRNAs and circular RNAs (circRNAs), as discussed in recent reviews. Applying these discoveries in predicting the prognosis of HCC could mark a significant advancement in the therapy of this disease.

Abstract: It has been reported that adding Al to Ag metallization paste can reduce the contact resistivity on boron-doped emitters of n-type c-Si solar cells such as Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact solar cell(TOPCon), because Al can assist forming Ag–Al spikes and dope into the p + emitter. However, Al addition also increases surface recombination and grid line resistivity. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding to the effect of Al on reducing contact resistivity is crucial for optimization of metallization process. In this paper, we investigated the contact characteristics between Ag–Al pastes with p-Si in comparison with those between Ag paste with p-Si. It was revealed that the driving forces for forming electrical contacts between Ag–Al pastes with p-Si is different from those between Ag pastes with p-Si. Moreover, we found that Al will induce the variation of Ag crystal orientation from (111) plane to (200) plane during firing. This induction process is firmly related to the melting amount of Ag during firing, accompanied by the disappearance of Ag3Al. Finally, the effect of Al addition on the contact potential reduction of metal electrodes/p-Si was studied so as to figure out the solution to improving contact properties, which is of great significance for the development of advanced Ag–Al pastes.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that phenyllactic acid (alpha-Hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, 2-Hydroxy-3-phenylpropionic acid, PLA), a type of organic acid metabolite, has excellent diagnostic efficacy when used to differentiate between prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and prostatitis. This research aims to explore the molecular mechanism by which PLA influences the PANoptosis of prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines. First, we found that PLA was detected in all prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, PC-3 M, DU145, LNCAP). Further experiments showed that the addition of PLA to prostate cancer cells could promote ATP generation, enhance cysteine desulfurase (NFS1) expression, and reduce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels, thereby inhibiting apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Notably, overexpression of NFS1 can inhibit the binding of TNF-α to serpin mRNA binding protein 1 (SERBP1), suggesting that NFS1 competes with TNF-α for binding to SERBP1. Knockdown of SERBP1 significantly reduced the level of small ubiquity-related modifier (SUMO) modification of TNF-α. This suggests that NFS1 reduces the SUMO modification of TNF-α by competing with SERBP1, thereby reducing the expression and stability of TNF-α and ultimately inhibiting apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. In conclusion, PLA inhibits TNF-α induced panapoptosis of prostate cancer cells through metabolic reprogramming, providing a new idea for targeted treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract: Circadian genes play an important role in the field of drug metabolism. Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 is a well-known phase I enzyme which participates in metabolism of many exogenous and endogenous substances, especially production of trimethylamine N-oxide. Here, we aimed to decipher diurnal rhythms of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 expression and activity, and explore the regulation mechanism by clock genes. Our results showed that its mRNA and protein exhibited robust diurnal rhythms in mouse liver and cell lines. Consistently, significant alterations were observed for in vitro microsomal N-oxidation rates of procainamide, which kept in line with its protein expression at different time in wild-type and reverse erythroblastosis virus α knockout mice. Further, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 was negatively regulated by E4 promoter-binding protein 4 in AML12 and Hepa1–6 cells, while it was positively influenced by reverse erythroblastosis virus α and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed E4 promoter-binding protein 4 inhibited the transcription of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 by binding to a D-box1 element (−1606/−1594 bp), while brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 positively activated the transcription via direct binding to three E-boxes (−863/−858 bp, −507/−498 bp, and −115/−104 bp) in this enzyme promoter. Taken together, this study would be helpful to reveal the mechanism of clock-controlled drug metabolism and facilitate the practice of chrono-therapeutics.

Abstract: This work systematically investigates the effect of 9 inorganic salt hydrates on the performance of strontium bromide (SrBr2) a thermochemical material (TCM). The goal is to boost the performance of this base salt by enhancing the reaction kinetics of the SrBr2 6-1 transition or by shrinking the reaction hysteresis. The study shows that the added salts that do not share a common ion with SrBr2 (LiCl, LiF, ZnF2, ZnI2, K2CO3) give limited to no benefits. The lack of improvement is due to a side reaction between SrBr2 and the added salt leading to the formation of new salt hydrate with low hygroscopicity that does not contribute to the thermochemical reaction. The addition of hygroscopic bromide salts with divalent cations (ZnBr2, CaBr2, MnBr2) gave mixed results depending on the sample history. The most likely cause is cation exchange between bromide salts occurring during exposure to high vapour pressures which promote ionic mobility. The overall best performance was achieved with the addition of LiBr, which we attribute to its high hygroscopicity.

Abstract: Interfacial solar steam generation (ISSG) is one of the promising solutions in the field of water filtration, desalination, and solvent recovery. For the industrial applications of the technology, there is a need for developing highly durable, thermally stable, and inert light absorbers. Therefore, this work addresses this issue by synthesizing black Titania (B–TiO2) via vacuum annealing and depositing it on glass fiber (GF) via vacuum filtration with an ethyl cellulose binder. According to the characterization techniques analyses, the change of colour is attributed to the occurrence of oxygen vacancies in the surface layers of TiO2 nanoparticles during vacuum annealing. The deposition parameters were optimized for achieving a maximum solar-weighted light absorptance of 95.7%. The optimized B–TiO2 GF was applied for the steam generation experiments and achieved the evaporation rate of 1.53 kg m−2 h−1, which corresponds to solar-steam conversion efficiency of 97.7 % under standard measurements condition of AM 1.5 G sun and ambient temperature and relative humidity of 20 °C and 40% respectively. Thanks to the high durability and chemical inertness of B–TiO2 GF it was applied for water filtration in extreme conditions of acidic/alkaline water and high-sun illumination (up to 35-sun). Worth noting that for high-sun experimentation there is a need to use a binder to improve particle attachment to the glass fibers.

Abstract: Polymer photovoltaic solar cells based on PTQ10:IT4F were fabricated and characterized with voluntary contamination of several impurities in various amounts. Impurities were selected as related to the Stille coupling reagents: in particular palladium catalysts and their respective ligands. Below a concentration of 300 ppm, the pristine device efficiencies were not significantly affected for any of the studied compounds. The degradation patterns under accelerated light soaking were not modified either. For higher impurities amounts (> 300 ppm), Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst shows a strong poisoning effect on both pristine device performances and operating stability. Interestingly, we demonstrate that not only the metallic center of the catalytic complex, but also the ligands can play a role on the organic solar cells performances.

Abstract: Passive radiative cooling and triboelectric generation provide a way to achieve zero-energy cooling and sustainable electricity generation, respectively. However, they are frequently studied independently and lack integration. Herein, a scalable porous film for thermal insulation, passive radiative cooling and triboelectric generation has been developed using a facile emulsion polymerization method. Abundant micrometer size air holes within the multifunction porous film (MFPF) result in a low thermal conductivity of 0.05 W/(m·K), and strong scattering occurs at the interface between the air holes and Ecoflex, resulting in high solar reflectance. Simultaneously, a high infrared emittance of 0.95 is attained owing to the molecular vibrations of Ecoflex. The MFPF delivers a theoretical net passive radiative cooling power of 29.04 W/m2 and 122.68 W/m2 during the daytime and nighttime. Additionally, it achieves an actual temperature drop of approximately 4.5 °C under direct sunlight on a clear day. Moreover, a triboelectric effect of a maximal power density of 0.03 W/m2 is achieved due to the triboelectric-negative nature of Ecoflex. This film can achieve passive radiative cooling in the summer while more effectively blocking heat penetration due to the significant temperature difference between the outdoors and indoors. Meanwhile, the film can convert sustainable energy into electricity.

Abstract: Photo-electrochemical cells (PECs) represent one of the most promising technologies today for storing sun energy as chemical bonds (solar fuels), exploiting carbon dioxide as a starting reagent. However, identifying suitable photoelectrodes remains a challenging and open issue. In this work, the possibility of using Aurivillius-type compounds to produce solar fuels was deeply investigated. Aurivillius-type perovskites, with general formula Bi(n+1)Fe(n-3)Ti3O(3n+3) (BFTO-n), were synthesized and fully characterized to study the influence of the number of perovskite layers and the synthesis parameters on their final properties. Specifically, eight different systems were considered increasing the amount of iron and, consequently, the number of perovskite layers. These compounds were synthesized through both a standard solid-state reaction method and a sol-gel technique. For each system, a screen printing ink was formulated to be deposited as photo-electrodes onto transparent conducting supports, and their morphological (XRD and SEM analysis) electrochemical and photo-electrochemical properties (cyclic and linear voltammetry, impedance, Mott-Schottky analysis) were determined. The obtained results demonstrate the potentiality of Aurivillius-type compounds as innovative materials for carbon dioxide photo-electrochemical reduction.

Abstract: Micro- and macrovascular complications frequently occur in patients with diabetes, with endothelial dysfunction playing a key role in the development and progression of the complications. For the early diagnosis and optimal treatment of vascular complications associated with diabetes, it is imperative to comprehend the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the function of diabetic endothelial cells. Mitochondria function as crucial sensors of environmental and cellular stress regulating endothelial cell viability, structural integrity and function. Impaired mitochondrial quality control mechanisms and mitochondrial dysfunction are the main features of endothelial damage. Hence, targeted mitochondrial therapy is considered promising novel therapeutic options in vascular complications of diabetes. In this review, we focus on the mitochondrial functions in the vascular endothelial cells and the pathophysiological role of mitochondria in diabetic endothelial dysfunction, aiming to provide a reference for related drug development and clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: The in-air stability of a novel solar absorber coating type based on aluminium titanium oxynitride nanocomposites deposited by Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) is studied up to temperatures of 800 °C. The microstructural and morphological characterization by high resolution electron microscopy and glancing angle X-ray diffraction reveals the creation of a nanocomposite structure formed by crystalline AlTiN nanoparticles inserted in an oxide matrix. This nanocomposite structure (nc-AlTiON) is responsible for the high absorption within the whole solar wavelength range (0.3–2.5 μm) that the absorber exhibits. The as-deposited absorber has a solar absorptance, α, of 92 % and room temperature emissivity, εRT, of 70 %. The deposition of an antireflecting Al2O3 top layer lowers the reflectance of the sample in the UV–Vis–NIR region and, consequently the solar absorptance increases up to 93.5 %. Post-deposition thermal treatments of 2 h at 800 °C further improve the solar absorptance and emissivity of the absorber (α = 96 %, εRT = 60 %). Thus, this nc-AlTiON/Al2O3 coating presents solar performances that match, within the experimental errors, the ones calculated for the commercial absorber paint Pyromark® at C = 1000 (typical of central tower receivers) or even surpass it for concentration factors typical of parabolic trough receivers (C = 100) under the same operating temperatures. Very importantly, the studied nc-AlTiON/Al2O3 solar absorber coating shows no degradation after 1000 h of thermal cycling in air between 300 and 700 °C. Therefore, the developed coating shows the best thermal in-air long-term stability up to 700 °C reported so far for PVD-based solar absorbers under cycling conditions, and it can be considered as a promising absorber candidate for Generation 3 (GEN3) CSP plants.

Abstract: Perovskite/Silicon (Pero-Si) tandem with silicon heterojunction (SHJ) bottom cells is a promising highly efficient concept, which in the case of mass production will likely rely on the same wafer feedstock as the single junction Si solar cells. The thickness of these wafers is constantly decreasing for economic and sustainability reasons. We forecast that Si bottom cells for mass produced Pero-Si tandems will be based on wafers thinner than 100 μm. In our work we study challenges and opportunities related to this likely wafer thinning for the performance of the SHJ bottom cells operating in Perovskite shadow. We study SHJ cells prepared on 80 μm thick wafers in comparison to the reference cells based on 135 μm thick wafers addressing two issues: passivation and light management. Effects of passivating layer thickness, back reflector and antireflection coating are studied under AM1.5G standard test conditions, attenuated AM1.5G irradiance, and under Perovskite-filtered spectrum. We show that major wafer thickness reduction of 40% turns to only approx. 0.35%abs loss in the bottom cell efficiency. This minor loss can be reduced even further using highly technological ITO/MgF2/Ag back reflector and MgF2 anti-reflection coating. Our work shows that significant potential for Pero-Si tandems is waiting to be explored in the perovskite shadow from the SHJ bottom cell perspective.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cells have world-leading efficiencies due to outstanding surface passivation. Yet, maintaining their performance during the lifetime of a photovoltaic module requires excellent quality and stability of the surface regions. It is well known that HJT solar cells can show an increase or reduction in performance under illumination, and this instability has been related to changes in the surface regions. This work investigates the stability of surface passivation in HJT solar cells by modelling the injection-dependent minority carrier lifetime of a range of symmetrically a-Si passivated silicon wafers. Fixed charges and defects at the interface are varied in the model to find the best fit to the injection-dependent lifetime before and after a high-intensity illumination treatment. The results indicate that the laser process induces an increase in field effect passivation at the surface, which is then reduced upon storage in the dark. The results show that lifetime spectroscopy is a useful tool to investigate the nature of a-Si passivation degradation.

Abstract: Towards long-term seasonal latent heat storage, the PCMs with strong supercooling are recommended as the heat storage medium. Nevertheless, the suitable techniques activating latent heat release is also of significance in the period of heat supply. The present work investigated the N2 bubbling triggered crystallization of supercooled xylitol. Special attention was paid to the subcooling effect. The N2 bubbling was identified to be a potential technique to trigger crystallization of xylitol at moderate degrees of subcooling. It was found that efficient crystallization issues were obtained with degrees of subcooling from 40 °C to 60 °C, while uncrystallization was obtained with both lower and higher subcooling. The recorded temperature history curves show that subcooling effect has strong influence on the crystallization behavior. The crystallization points tend to decline from 51.9 °C to 42.3 °C with degree of subcooling rising from 40 °C to 50 °C. The crystallization durations extend with subcooling effect enhancing. Fortunately, bubbling technique has slight influence on the properties of formed xylitol crystals. Moreover, the subcooling significantly influences the transportation behavior of bubbles. Particularly, The specific growth rates of bubbles are determined to be as low as 0.005 mm/min with the lowest degree of subcooling 10 °C, and continue to rise over 20 times when the subcooling reaches to 60 °C. The interfaces of bubbles as potential nucleation sites were deemed to be one of the important issues to activate heterogeneous nucleation, thus trigger crystallization. The present investigation is helpful to understand the fundamentals of bubbling effect on crystallization with broad range of subcooling.

Abstract: In semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) comprising a sputtered top electrode, the minimisation of detrimental sputter damage and/or its curing by post-processing treatment is essential to reach high efficiencies. In this work, we investigate the influence of sputter damage and post-deposition annealing steps for different electron transport layers (ETLs) in PSCs without the need of a protective buffer layer such as tin oxide deposited by atomic layer deposition. We compare solution-processed 6,6-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to thermally evaporated C60, each in combination with a bathocuproine (BCP) layer deposited by spin coating or thermal evaporation including a thickness variation. In general, we find that C60 is more resilient against sputter damage and thus C60-based cells show higher as-grown power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Post-deposition annealing of the complete cell stack increases the PCE further to values > 16 % on 0.5 cm2 active area. However, we observe that the remaining solvent in the spin-coated PCBM layer is highly beneficial for the curing of the sputter damage during post-deposition annealing and we achieve even higher PCEs for cells incorporating solution-processed PCBM with up to > 18 % on 0.5 cm2. We show an alternative way to reach high efficiency semi-transparent perovskite solar cells without using thermally evaporated C60 and/or a buffer layer like tin oxide deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD).

Abstract: Molten salts are excellent heat transfer and storage materials due to their outstanding properties, but their strong corrosive properties at high temperatures will cause severe negative consequences. In this paper, a cellular automata (CA) model is developed by MATLAB software to simulate the corrosion behavior of Hastelloy X alloy in NaCl–KCl–MgCl2 ternary molten salt. The simulated reliability is validated through a 7-day corrosion experiment. The simulation investigated factors influencing corrosion layer thickness, studied the formation of pitting behavior, and simulated the corrosion inhibition of surface coatings. The simulation results indicated that the composition of alloy, the concentration of O2 and Cl2, and the reaction rate are the main reasons for the serious corrosion of the alloy. By increasing the density and thickness of the coating can effectively alleviate corrosion. Compared with conventional corrosion experiments, the CA model can monitor real-time atomic migration at the metal-molten salt interface, track element distribution within the metal, and shorten the corrosion experiment period, which is of significance to study and predict the corrosion behavior of alloys in molten salts.

Abstract: The efficient use of solar energy can alleviate the energy shortage, so the photothermal conversion materials have been a hot spot for research. Improved thermal conductivity and higher enthalpy/flexibility can expand the practical application scenarios of photothermal conversion materials. Therefore, a flexible composite material for photothermal conversion is developed in this paper. Among them, carbon nanotube (MWCNT) is the photothermal conversion material, melamine foam (MF) is the supporting skeleton of the composite, and paraffin wax (PW) is the phase change material. According to the results, MWCNT/MF/PW has a high latent enthalpy of 240 J/g. The thermal conductivity of MWCNT/MF/PW (0.129 W/m·K) was improved by 95.5% compared to MF/PW (0.066 W/m·K). MWCNT/MF/PW have a high photo-thermal conversion efficiency (85.16%). Hence, MWCNT/MF/PW exhibit excellent shape recovery due to the response to light and heat. In addition, the outdoor light absorption experiment of the composite PCM water tank indicates that MWCNT/MF/PW as a shell wrapped water tank shows good light absorption and heat preservation effect, which is not available for general photothermal conversion materials.

Abstract: A complementary electrochromic device (ECD) configuration featuring a protonated viologen (VNH2+) as the cathodically coloring electrochrome and a composite of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene-carbazole) (i.e. poly(EDOT-Cz)) and Prussian blue (PB) as the anodically coloring electrochrome marks the first implementation of this innovative high contrast device. A comparative analysis of VNH2+//poly(EDOT-Cz) and VNH2+//poly(EDOT-Cz)/PB ECDs demonstrates a superior integrated visible light transmission modulation (ΔT) of 50.4%, versus 76.7%, higher diffusion coefficient of 4.4 × 10−11 versus 3.9 × 10−10 cm2 s−1, higher coloration efficiency (CE) of 424 versus 562 cm2 C−1 (at 550 nm), faster color-bleach switching times of (7.0 and 4.0 s) versus (1.2 and 1.0 s) and a CIE chromaticity coordinate corresponding an intense deep blue state (y: 0.058 versus 0.218) achieved with the composite relative to the pure polymer. The VNH2+//PB ECD also shows lower CE (69 cm2 C−1) and slower coloration-bleaching kinetics (20 and 2 s) compared to the composite based ECD. In addition, long-term cycling stability attained for the VNH2+//poly(EDOT-Cz)/PB ECD, whereby it endures 5000+ color-bleach cycles without showing any major deterioration in optical modulation or switching kinetics underscores the suitability of the composite based ECD for practical smart window applications.

Abstract: Backgrounds
Senile osteoporosis—alternatively labeled as skeletal aging—encompasses age-induced bone deterioration and loss of bone microarchitecture. Recent studies have indicated a potential association between senile osteoporosis and chronic systemic inflammation, and pyroptosis in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells is speculated to contribute to bone loss and osteoporosis. Therefore, targeting pyroptosis in stem cells may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating osteoporosis.
Methods
Initially, we conducted bioinformatics analysis to screen the GEO databases to identify the key gene associated with pyroptosis in senile osteoporosis. Next, we analyzed the relationship between altered proteins and clinical data. In vitro experiments were then performed to explore whether the downregulation of PKM2 expression could inhibit pyroptosis. Additionally, an aging-related mouse model of osteoporosis was established to validate the efficacy of a PKM2 inhibitor in alleviating osteoporosis progression.
Results
We identified PKM2 as a key gene implicated in pyroptosis in senile osteoporosis patients through bioinformatics analysis. Further analyses of bone marrow and stem cells demonstrated significant PKM2 overexpression in senile osteoporosis patients. Silencing PKM2 expression inhibited pyroptosis in senile stem cells, of which the osteogenesis potential and angiogenic function were also primarily promoted. Moreover, the results in vivo demonstrated that administering PKM2 inhibitors suppressed pyroptosis in senile osteoporosis mice and mitigated senile osteoporosis progression.
Conclusion
Our study uncovered PKM2, a key pyroptosis marker of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in senile osteoporosis. Shikonin, a PKM2 inhibitor, was then identified as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis.

Abstract: The passivating contact concept stands out as one of the most promising and industrially viable photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Further improving the quality of physical contact has become a focus of ongoing research. The film blistering issue has been identified as one of the major bottlenecks for the polysilicon (poly-Si) films deposited by the PECVD approach. In this study, we investigated how the in-situ phosphorus (P) doping level within the poly-Si films contributes to the occurrence of blistering. Our investigations into the film blistering mechanisms reveal that a high in-situ P-doping suppresses hydrogen release levels and reduces the accumulation of residual stress during annealing, which leads to the blistering-free appearance, especially observed in heavily P-doped poly-Si films. However, as excessive P-doping could weaken the interfacial passivation quality, we propose a bi-layer structure of P-doped poly-Si films which allows the doping profile to be tailored and maintain good quality passivating contacts. Based on the bi-layer structure, we fabricated industrial-sized tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells, which attained an average efficiency of 23.84%. Our work not only presents a promising strategy for improving the performance of passivating contacts via the PECVD approach but also underscores the significant potential for its widespread implementation in industrial TOPCon solar cell manufacturing.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of various material parameters, such as film resistivity, the thickness of the absorber layer, uncompensated acceptor density, and carrier lifetime, on the carrier transport and device characteristics of emerging CdS/Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells. The modeling approach is based on the rigorous Sah-Noyce-Shockley recombination model at the PN-junction, which is based on drift and diffusion collection efficiencies for total current-density calculations. The current-density and voltage have been optimized against the Sb2Se3 thickness and the depletion width at the CdS/Sb2Se3 junction. It has been determined that the lower efficiency of the cell is primarily due to the relatively short electron lifetime and the uncompensated acceptor density, which can widen or narrow the depletion width. The resistivity of the Sb2Se3 film can effectively control the voltage of the cell, however, the carrier lifetime can control this impact even to a higher extent. Therefore, the carrier lifetime and uncompensated acceptor densities are the two interdependent parameters that significantly control the current, voltage, and efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells. This research provides valuable insights for the design and optimization of Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells shedding light on carrier transport and charge collection mechanism in these emerging materials.

Abstract: Upconversion – the absorption of two or more photons resulting in radiative emission at a higher energy than the excitation – has the potential to enhance the efficiency of solar energy harvesting technologies, most notably photovoltaics. However, the required ultra-high light intensities and the narrow absorption bands of lanthanide ions limit efficient solar utilisation. In this paper, we report results from exciting upconverters with concentrated sunlight at flux densities up to 2300 suns, where the radiation is restricted to photon energies below the bandgap of silicon (corresponding to a wavelength λ = 1200 nm). Upconversion to λ = 980 nm is achieved by using hexagonal erbium-doped sodium yttrium fluoride (β-NaYF4: Er3+) in a fluoropolymer matrix. Upconversion has a nonlinear relation with irradiance, therefore at a high irradiance a threshold occurs where the process becomes linear. For β-NaYF4:25%Er3+, we find a two-photon threshold under concentrated sunlight at 320 suns. Notably, this threshold is lower than under corresponding laser excitation and can be related to all resonantly excited Er3+ ion levels and excited stated absorption. These results highlight a pathway that utilises a far broader portion of the solar spectrum for photovoltaics.

Abstract: Self-cleaning coatings and/or surfaces have attracted great attention for photovoltaic (PV) panel and building window glass applications. In this work, we have developed TiO2–SiO2-PAA (polyacrylic acid) nanocomposite superhydrophilic coating by spraying and brushing deposition. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV–Vis spectra, water contact angle test, photocatalytic activity and waterfall impact test were used to characterize the self-cleaning coating. We found that the introduced PAA in the TiO2–SiO2 nanocomposite can improve the superhydrophilicity, durability and antireflection of the coating. Long-term outdoor tests, ranging from one year to four years, were conducted for the variation of both the average transmission in visible region (400–700 nm) of the coating in glass, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and PV power generation. The relative self-cleaning efficacy (RSCE) shows different variations over time in the PET and glass substrate. The RSCE of the coating deposited on PET is only about 2 % in the first 150-day period and increases to ∼15 % after that time, which then stabilizes at one year mark. However, for the coating on glass substrate, we found that the average RSCE can be maintained at 4 % within 3 years, then it varies to about 2 % in the fourth year. This is in agreement with our data of the increase (2.8 %) of power generation test in PV panel. Finally, we found that the duration of the coating deposited by spraying was longer than that of deposited by brushing, due to the thinner thickness of the coating deposited by brushing. However, the coating deposited on a commercially available anti-reflection (AR) coating glass surface only becomes effective a month after its application. Our results indicate that the coating has strong potential in applications of PV panel maintenance.

Abstract: We present 22.5% efficient large area (M2), n-type rear junction biPoly™ solar cells featuring selective poly-Si based passivation on the front and full area poly-Si on the rear side. The metal contacts to the selective poly-Si fingers on the front are formed by screen-printing fire-through Ag paste. Two different approaches are compared for the contact formation on the rear side – using fire-through silver-aluminium paste are and non-fire –through Al paste. Prior to the screen-printing the Al paste, laser is used to pattern the local contact openings (LCO) wherein the Al paste alloys with the c-Si substrate during high temperature firing forming contacts. The impact of the LCO pitch, Si content in Al paste and the firing temperature is studied by meticulously designed experiments. We further develop a 3 dimensional model of the biPoly™ solar cells and try to explain the trends observed in the experimental results.

Abstract: Ferroelectric materials have garnered substantial research interest in the development of novel self-powered ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors due to their polarization-induced photovoltaic (PV) effect. However, ferroelectric-based self-powered UV detectors reported so far exhibit low photocurrent, responsivity, and detectivity that hindered their integration with existing platforms. Herein, we fabricate PbZr0·52Ti0·48O3 (PZT)/CuSCN heterojunction to realize a self-powered UV detector, exhibiting enhanced photodetection owing to the constructive coupling of the robust depolarization field of PZT ferroelctric, and built-in electric field at PZT/CuSCN interface. The device displays remarkable reproducibility and a substantial light/dark current ratio of ∼24 under illumination of 320 nm light. Moreover, the responsivity and detectivity of the device are as high as 0.125 ± 0.011 W/A and 6.931 ± 0.009 × 1010 Jones under light density of 8.11 W/cm2, respectively. This study presents a viable and effective approach for enhancing the photodetection performance of ferroelectric-based self-powered UV detectors.

Abstract: Open-circuit voltage (VOC) losses due to various recombination mechanisms are well-recognized limitations towards high-performance solar cells. Thin film Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe)-based solar cells have been well-developed and commercially used in the photovoltaic community due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) with high chemical stability and cost-effectiveness. Recently, numerous works on modification of the CIGSe/buffer band alignment and alkali post-deposition treatment on CIGSe have shown obvious enhancement of the solar cell efficiency. In this work, we explore the effects of subgap absorption driven by quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) and Urbach tail (EU) states in CIGSe on VOC losses. In particular, we take all subgap absorption contributions into account to precisely fit the full photoluminescence (PL) spectra and obtain the QFLS and EU energies using an integrated model. We found that for CIGSe films with different Ga contents, the model can fit the PL spectra perfectly, which allows the extraction of reliable values of QFLS and EU. Using these values, we further calculated the VOC in both the SQ and radiative limit, as well as the non-radiative loss due to subgap absorption. We also showed that sample with a larger QFLS and a lower EU exhibits a smaller VOC loss and thus a higher PCE. Although the effects of QFLS on VOC is much smaller than Urbach tail, a more accurate estimation of VOC loss due to non-radiative recombination can be achieved when QFLS is considered. These results shed light on the origin of VOC losses in solar cells, which is potentially useful for the advancement of PV technology.

Abstract: Electroluminescence and photoluminescence imaging of crystalline silicon solar cells are powerful characterization techniques for research and industrial applications. Both techniques can provide spatially resolved data of the implied open-circuit voltage, a critical parameter for photovoltaic devices. However, the conversion of luminescence intensities into implied voltages often requires a challenging calibration process, which must be performed separately for distinct sample types. Here, we present a novel voltage calibration method for silicon wafers and cells, which eliminates the need for sample-specific calibration. We demonstrate that with a suitable selection of optical filters, the error in the implied open-circuit voltage for typical textured silicon solar cells and wafers can be limited to 3 mV.

Abstract: This work deals with shingle solar modules, in particular the interconnection of shingle solar cells by using an electrically conductive adhesive (ECA), as well as by simply overlapping the same type of shingle solar cells but omitting the ECA. For both types of interconnection, the resistance due to interconnection Rint and the corresponding cell-to-module (CTM) power loss ΔPMPP in the case of a full-size shingle module are quantified, finding Rint ≈ 0.26 mΩ and ΔPMPP ≈ −0.4 W for the ECA-based interconnection, and Rint ≈ 0.86 mΩ and ΔPMPP ≈ −1.2 W for the ECA-free interconnection. The work mainly focuses on the methodology used to derive these numbers from small-format modules containing shingle strings of different lengths. An extensive error discussion is given, as well as a discussion on the advantages over a different approach to determine Rint.

Abstract: Doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used chemotherapy agent in cancer treatment, encounters limitations in clinical efficacy due to associated cardiotoxicity. This study aims to explore the role of AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 (AKT2) in mitigating DOX-induced oxidative stress within the heart through both intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways. Utilizing Akt2 knockout (KO) and Nrf2 KO murine models, alongside neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs), we systematically investigate the impact of AKT2 deficiency on DOX-induced cardiac injury. Our findings reveal that DOX administration induces significant oxidative stress, a primary contributor to cardiac injury. Importantly, Akt2 deficiency exhibits a protective effect by alleviating DOX-induced oxidative stress. Mechanistically, Akt2 deficiency facilitates nuclear translocation of NRF2, thereby suppressing intracellular oxidative stress by promoting the expression of antioxidant genes. Furthermore, We also observed that AKT2 inhibition facilitates superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression both inside macrophages and SOD2 secretion to the extracellular matrix, which is involved in lowering oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes upon DOX stimulation. The present study underscores the important role of AKT2 in mitigating DOX-induced oxidative stress through both intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways. Additionally, our findings propose promising therapeutic strategies for addressing DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in clinic.

Abstract: Our study identified a novel long noncoding RNA, LINC01322, that acts as an oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma progression. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA purification assays indicated that LINC01322 was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of LINC01322 in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. LINC01322 may promote lung adenocarcinoma proliferation and migration through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the knockdown of LINC01322 significantly suppressed lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and activation of the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway, whereas overexpression had the opposite effects. Inhibition of the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway activity partially reversed the enhancement of cell proliferation and migration caused by LINC01322 overexpression. In vivo experiments further verified the oncogene role of LINC01322. Altogether, our findings suggest that LINC01322 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression by activating the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway and that it could be a therapeutic target.

Abstract: Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) exhibits promising characteristics as an absorber material in photovoltaic solar cells. To enhance the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells, we propose a reevaluation of the device design through the utilization of device simulation techniques and optimization algorithms. To ensure the model's accuracy, a calibration procedure is performed by comparing the experimental data obtained from a fabricated structure (Mo/MoSe2/Sb2Se3/TiO2/CdS/ZnO/Al:ZnO) with numerical simulation results. Simultaneous investigation was conducted to assess the efficacy of incorporating sulfur into the absorber layer of Sb2Se3 and introducing zinc into the CdS buffer layer within the conventional Sb2Se3 cell configuration. In this study, we examined the influence of alterations in energy levels at the Cd1-xZnxS/Sb2(S1-ySey)3 junction. Our research demonstrates that by utilizing an Sb2(S1-ySey)3 absorber layer with a Se concentration of 0.8 and a Cd1-xZnxS buffer with a Zn mole fraction of 0.7, the cell efficiency can be enhanced from 9.2% to 15.6%. The presented solar cell undergoes optimization of crucial design factors, comprising the thickness of the buffer and absorber layers, as well as their doping concentration. These optimizations are achieved through the utilization of the grey wolf optimization algorithm and fuzzy system, for the first time. By meticulously adjusting each of the aforementioned key design parameters, we were able to achieve an impressive efficiency of approximately 18% for the suggested Sb2(S0·2Se0.8)3/Cd0·3Zn0·7S cell.

Abstract: Air-processed kesterite solar cells show excellent prospects for commercial application because they are suitable for large-scale production. This study shows how the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of (Cu, Ag)2ZnSn(S, Se)4 solar cells can be improved by adjusting the annealing time during the selenization process at a low temperature of 70 °C. Enhancement of PCE is achieved when the annealing time is 240 s. The primary determinant of enhanced PCE is a reduction in reverse saturation current density (J0) and ideality factor (A). Examination of depth characterization indicated that the decrease in J0 and A can be ascribed to the inhibition of [2CuZn + SnZn] defects cluster, which is mainly accountable for the band tail states, and the suppression of interface recombination.

Abstract: Employing advanced electrochromic technology, the low energy-consuming smart windows seamlessly regulate light transmission, optimizing energy efficiency without compromising comfort. This innovation marks a significant stride toward sustainable architecture, offering dynamic control over interior luminosity while reducing reliance on conventional power sources. In that context, a porous perylene diimide (PDI) and triazine-containing covalent polymeric framework, PD-CPF, was synthesized for electrochromic (EC) applications. The PD-CPF-based electrochromic device (ECD) exhibited a multicolored, durable visible-to-NIR electrochromism when used in an ECD. The low-power-consuming (3.05 mW/cm2) electrochromic (EC) smart window remarkably lowered the solar irradiance gain by 68%.

Abstract: Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, presents significant challenges to patients due to its poor prognosis. Recent research has increasingly implicated circular RNAs in the development and progression of lung cancer. These circular RNAs have been found to impact various aspects of tumor behavior, including proliferation, metastasis, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cancer stem cells, therapy response, and the tumor microenvironment. One of the key mechanisms by which circular RNAs exert their influence is through their ability to act as miRNA sponges, sequestering microRNAs and preventing them from targeting other RNA molecules. Accumulating evidence suggests that circular RNAs can function as competing endogenous RNAs, affecting the expression of target mRNAs by sequestering microRNAs. Dysregulation of competing endogenous RNAs networks involving circular RNAs, microRNAs, and mRNAs leads to the aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors involved in lung cancer pathogenesis. Understanding the dynamic interplay and molecular mechanisms among circular RNAs, microRNAs, and mRNAs holds great promise for advancing early diagnosis, personalized therapeutic interventions, and improved patient outcomes in lung cancer. Therefore, this study aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the executive roles of circular RNAs/microRNAs/ mRNAs interactions in lung cancer pathogenesis and their potential utility for diagnosing lung cancer, predicting patient prognosis, and guiding targeted therapies. By offering a comprehensive overview of the dysregulation of the axes as driving factors in lung cancer, we aim to pave the way for their translation into clinical practice in the future.

Abstract: Most photovoltaic modules typically exhibit a structure configuration of either glass-to-back sheet or glass-to-glass. These configurations are widely used in standard construction and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. Recent developments in building safety have underscored the need for BIPV systems to conform to the safety standards expected for construction materials. Particularly, extensive research is necessary to improve their fire safety performance. Several European and technologically advanced countries have established standards and certification regulations pertaining to fire safety in photovoltaic modules. Currently, the structure and components of photovoltaic modules are highly susceptible to fire safety issues. Among the configurations, the glass-to-glass photovoltaic modules stand out as the only option offering exceptional fire safety because they are covered with glass on both sides. However, this dual glass coverage results in increased weight, increasing the difficulty in installation, maintenance, and repair of the modules for BIPV applications. To address this issue, ongoing research focuses on developing lightweight technologies and lightweight BIPV modules. This study introduces a novel design methodology to enhance the mechanical reliability of glass-to-glass photovoltaic modules. We conducted mechanical load tests on commercially available modules and used ANSYS static structural analysis to model and simulate these tests. By varying the glass-shape parameters in the validated structural analysis model, we designed a glass-to-glass photovoltaic module configuration with an increased surface area that ensures mechanical reliability. This design enabled the development of a photovoltaic module model that is 21.33% lighter than existing commercial photovoltaic module while maintaining the requisite mechanical reliability.

Abstract: The application of molten chloride salts in next generation concentrated solar power plants is limited by their corrosiveness to structural materials. This work investigated the influence of SO42− ions on the corrosion of 316H stainless steel (SS) in MgCl2–KCl–NaCl (45.4-21.6-33 mol.%) molten salt using static immersion tests and microstructural analysis techniques. The results demonstrate that the presence of SO42− ions can significantly accelerate the intergranular corrosion of 316H SS by driving the dissolution of alloying elements Fe, Cr, and Mn. SO42− ions diffuse into the alloy bulk along the grain boundaries, resulting in the intergranular corrosion attack. The chemcial reaction rate of the metal atoms is directly proportional to the concentration of SO42− ions. The corrosion rate of 316H SS in salt with 1000 ppm SO42− (167 μm/year) was more than 10 times that in without SO42− (13.3 μm/year), increasing linearly with increasing SO42− concentration. Furthermore, MgCl2, the composition of the molten chloride salt, is involved in the corrosion reaction with SO42−, through Na2SO4 + 3Fe + MgCl2MgFe2O4 + 2NaCl + FeS (△G 700°C = −337 kJ/mol), leading to the severe dissolution of the Fe matrix element in 316H SS. Based on the corrosion mechanism of SO42− ions in chloride salts, several promising research directions are proposed for future studies.

Abstract: Minimising charge losses at silicon interfaces is a major development area for highly efficient solar cells. Here we report on the interface improvements achieved by establishing a surface electric field during low-temperature firing of dielectric thin films. By inducing a corona electric field on the surface of a thin film stack, we observe significant modifications to the silicon-dielectric interface upon annealing, which correlate with the characteristics of interface defects. The passivation properties of the interfaces strongly depend on the polarity and strength of the electric field during firing, as well as the dielectric materials in the layer stack. We show that the surface electric fields not only influence surface carrier population but also affect the resulting chemical interface properties post-annealing. It is postulated that hydrogen migration plays a role in these observed effects. Leveraging the corona-induced electric field enables fine-tuning of both the chemical and field-effect passivation in thin film surface dielectrics, resulting in recombination current densities as low as 2.8 fA cm−2 in research-grade float zone silicon, and 14 fA cm−2 in industrial-grade textured silicon. The simplicity and versatility of the thin film electric polarisation enable a new strategy for controlling and exploiting the chemical enhancement of interfaces in solar cell devices, from current TOPCon and PERC devices to future multijunction silicon-based cells.

Abstract: The medium temperature phase change material gels (PCMGs) have a thermal storage capacity to meet the body's needs for thermal comfort in cold environments. However, traditional PCMGs are prone to leakage and break in solid-liquid phase change process towards personal thermal management (PTM) application. This study develops an innovative approach that uses covalent and ionic crosslinking to simultaneously maintain the form-stability and self-healing capabilities of sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) PCMGs. The self-healing performance of SAT PCMGs is contributed to the dynamic interaction of ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds in sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) and calcium alginate (CA). The interaction between SAT and dual network (PAAS and CA) provides form-stability to SAT. To remove SAT's supercooling degree, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate is chosen as the nucleating agent. The proposed SAT PCMGs demonstrate high shape stability, high self-healing properties, high thermal conductivity (0.58 W m−1 K−1) and high thermal energy storage capacity (170.30 Jg-1). Germanium (Ge) membrane prepared by combining Ge powder with chitosan presents high solar absorption. A device consisting of Ge membrane and SAT PCMG is applied in static and dynamic PTM to produce thermal comfort by solar-thermal conversion, thermal energy storage and thermal energy utilization. With this effort, an advanced substitute for the upcoming solar-thermal PTM devices is created.

Abstract: The current study discussed the integration between two computational approaches to evaluate the hydrothermal properties, such as pressure drop (ΔP), energy efficiency (ηeng), and absorbed energy (Qabs) of solar collectors using hybrid nanofluids. The physical problem was solved through a 3D model using Ansys 2021R1. After that, the three outputs were predicted through MATLAB R2022b using Optimize a Boosted Regression Ensemble by implementing Least-Squares Boosting (LSBoost) with Bayesian optimization (BO). Various working fluids were tested: distilled water (DW), Graphene oxide (GO-DW) nanofluids, and hybrid graphene oxide/silicon dioxide (GO/SiO2-DW) nanofluids in the mixing ratio (50:50), in the concentration range 0.01-1 vol%. The simulations covered a range of Reynolds numbers (300 ≤ Re ≤ 1500) and inlet temperatures (30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, and 60 °C). The results indicated that, the maximum variation compared to the first and second validations for mass flow rates and different nanofluid concentrations was between 3.96-4.71% and 4.32–6.45%. At an inlet temperature of 30 °C, GO-DW-1% exhibited the highest ΔP, ηeng, and Qabs, while GO-SiO2-DW-1% closely followed with slightly lower energy values. The maximum errors between computational fluid dynamics and machine learning predictions for (ΔP), (ηeng), and (Qabs) ranged from 2.40% to 6.32%, depending on the type of nanofluids (single or hybrid) and the volume concentration. To conclude, the current approach showed a promising result in the photothermal devices.

The sheet resistance and surface passivation quality were almost comparable for the TOPCon structures fabricated using the both implantation systems. An excellent implied open circuit voltage exceeding 745 mV demonstrated the high quality surface passivation. In addition, almost similar conversion efficiencies of 20.5 % and 20.1 % were obtained for the solar cells fabricated using the beam line system and the PIII system, respectively.

Abstract: Phase change material is a promising solution to solve the mismatch between the energy demand and supply in solar energy applications. However, the inorganic phase change materials suffer from supercooling and poor thermal conductivity. This study aims at developing an electrically-triggered copper foam-based and expanded graphite-based sodium acetate trihydrate phase change composites to achieve the on-demand regulation of exothermic temperature and time and quick temperature response. First, the copper foam-based and expanded graphite-based sodium acetate trihydrate phase change composites achieving high thermal conductivity were synthesized. Then, a novel electrode with gradient rough structure was fabricated to trigger the crystallization of supercooled phase change composites. The DC voltage was only 1.5 V and the induction time was less than 5 s. The contradictory effects of copper foam and expanded graphite on both thermal conductivity and supercooling degree were simultaneously investigated, and stable supercooled phase change composites with high thermal conductivity were successfully explored. The cloudy dendrite grew instantaneously on the tip of the electrode once the DC voltage was exerted. After that, the electrically-triggered crystallization behaviours of the supercooled phase change composite were investigated. The experimental results indicated that the increase in thermal conductivity would accelerate the crystallization process and achieve a quick heat release and temperature response. These research findings would be useful in the development of intelligently on-demand energy storage technology.

Abstract: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common diseases in elderly men worldwide that may result in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). At present, the specific pathophysiological mechanism for BPH/LUTS LUTS remains unclear. S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4), a member of the calcium binding protein family, regulates a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis and fibrosis. The aim of the current study was to explore and clarify the possible role of S100A4 in BPH/LUTS. The human prostate stromal cell line (WPMY-1), rat prostate epithelial cells, human prostate tissues and two BPH rat models were employed in this study. The expression and localization of S100A4 were detected by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis. Also, S100A4 knockdown or overexpression cell models were constructed and a BPH rat model was induced with testosterone propionate (T) or phenylephrine (PE). The BPH animals were treated with Niclosamide, a S100A4 transcription inhibitor. Results demonstrated that S100A4 was mainly localized in human prostatic stroma and rat prostatic epithelium, and showed a higher expression in BPH. Knockdown of S100A4 induced cell apoptosis, cell proliferation arrest and a reduction of tissue fibrosis markers. Overexpression of S100A4 reversed the aforementioned changes. We also demonstrated that S100A4 regulated proliferation and apoptosis mainly through the ERK pathway and modulated fibrosis via Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In conclusion, our novel data demonstrate that S100A4 could play a crucial role in BPH development and may be explored as a new therapeutic target of BPH.

Abstract: Ultrathin monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) wafers with thicknesses less than 100 μm have gained significant attention from the PV community, not only because of the decreased consumption of silicon materials but also because of their excellent flexural strength. However, the 1–3 μm pyramids introduced by the conventional alkaline texturing process affect the mechanical strength of ultrathin wafers. In this study, we demonstrate a novel texturing process that combines metal-catalyzed chemical etching and alkaline etching for ∼80 μm wafers. The resulting submicron pyramids of ∼865 nm endowed the wafers with better light trapping ability and flexural strength than did conventional alkaline-textured wafers with the same thickness. Due to the introduction of a porous silicon layer, submicron pyramids can form very quickly in 240 s at 60 °C; as a comparison, the conventional alkaline texturing process should be carried out in 420 s at 80 °C. The flexural strength of textured ultrathin wafers can be largely enhanced by using a separate edge rounding procedure. Therefore, such a novel texturing process combined with a simple edge rounding procedure offers a promising solution for texturing ultrathin wafers as a footstone for fabricating flexible mono-Si solar cells.

The films are electrochromic, and an increase of the applied potential leads to a variation from a bleached to a colored state as a result of proton (H+) extraction together with extraction of electrons from the valence band. The complex frequency-dependent impedance displays different features in different potential ranges. At low potentials, where coloration is weak, the spectra give evidence for a constant-phase element in parallel with a leak resistance. At intermediate and high potentials, the impedance spectra indicate the presence of a diffusion process, and a model for anomalous diffusion gives excellent fits to the spectra except in a crossover region. The applicability of this model in a significant part of the studied potential range suggests the presence of a multiple-trapping process for the ions. The potential dependence of the chemical capacitance, as well as the diffusion coefficient of un-trapped ions, are analyzed. The electrochemical density-of-states of the charge-compensating electrons gives indications of the top of the valence band and of a band tail extending into the band gap. Diffusion coefficients are found to increase steeply in the crossover potential region to very high values at high potentials. These features are discussed and related to the electrochromic behavior of Ni-oxide-based thin films.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of heating, air-conditioning, and solid waste recycling in buildings, this work proposed the solid waste semi-coke ash as skeleton material and the sodium carbonate as phase-change material to produce shape-stable phase-change composites using the cold compression-hot sintering method for building thermal energy storage. Eight shape-stable phase-change composites were prepared and the detailed chemical compatibility, thermal property, structural and mechanical performance, and micromorphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, laser flash analysis, N2 adsorption and desorption method, constant speed pressurization method, and scanning electron microscopy. Results demonstrated that semi-coke ash is suitable with sodium carbonate for fabricating shape-stable phase-change composites. The optimal mass ratio of semi-coke ash to Na2CO3 powder for sample CC3 was determined to be 52.5:47.5. This particular sample demonstrated a thermal energy storage density of 961.58 J/g and a maximum thermal conductivity of 1.306 W/(m ∙ K). It also exhibited excellent chemical compatibility between its components. Furthermore, sample CC3 displayed a mechanical strength of 23.57 MPa, with elements evenly distributed throughout. Importantly, CO2 emission from the production of sample CC3 was significantly low, indicating great potential for commercialization.

Abstract: Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type 1E (HSAN1E) is a rare autosomal dominant neurological disorder due to missense mutations in DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). To investigate the nature of the dominant effect, we compared methylomes of transgenic R1wtDnmt1 and R1Dnmt1Y495C mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) overexpressing WT and the mutant mouse proteins respectively, with the R1 (wild-type) cells. In case of R1Dnmt1Y495C, 15 out of the 20 imprinting control regions were hypomethylated with transcript level dysregulation of multiple imprinted genes in ESCs and neurons. Non-imprinted regions, minor satellites, major satellites, LINE1 and IAP repeats were unaffected. These data mirror the specific imprinting defects associated with transient removal of DNMT1 in mESCs, deletion of the maternal-effect DNMT1o variant in preimplantation mouse embryos, and in part, reprogramming to naïve human iPSCs. This is the first DNMT1 mutation demonstrated to specifically affect Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs), and reinforces the differences in maintenance methylation of ICRs over non-imprinted regions. Consistent with nervous system abnormalities in the HSAN1E disorder and involvement of imprinted genes in normal development and neurogenesis, R1Dnmt1Y495C cells showed dysregulated pluripotency and neuron marker genes, and yielded more slender, shorter, and extensively branched neurons. We speculate that R1Dnmt1Y495C cells produce predominantly dimers containing mutant proteins, leading to a gradual and specific loss of ICR methylation during early human development.

Abstract: Amidst worsening water scarcity in the urban region, exploring alternative water sources is crucial. Atmospheric water extraction (AWE) technology emerges as a cost-effective and efficient remedy for the escalating issue of water scarcity. The objective of this research is to experimentally explore a novel AWE system that incorporates phase change material (PCM). This system is designed to facilitate uninterrupted water generation, even when there is no solar energy. It comprises of a solar air heater based on both-sides open evacuated tube collector having an area of 4.86 m2, which is encapsulated with acetamide-PCM. Additionally, it incorporates a silica gel filled desiccant bed and an air-cooled heat exchanger for vapor condensation. The system is investigated for two different desiccant bed weights of 15 kg (case 1) and 20 kg (case 2), respectively. The system's effectiveness is examined based on rate of adsorption, rate of regeneration, thermal, overall & exergy efficiency. The economic, environmental & enviro-economic analysis is also presented to ensure the system's sustainability & feasibility for its practical use. The results demonstrate that for case 2 the system extracts 4.1 L/day (0.843 L/m2/day) fresh water with 12.65%, 10.48% and 5.65% thermal, overall and exergy efficiency, respectively, for 20 kg desiccant bed weight. The fresh water cost is 0.12 $/L with 2 years & 1 month of payback time and 4 years & 7 months of energy payback period. The environmental & enviro-economic analysis ensures the system's eco-friendliness. Additionally, rigorous quality testing of the extracted water is carried out to affirm its suitability for safe consumption.

Abstract: To improve the charge separation and transporting between PbS/TiO2 interface in PbS quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells, a 400 nm length anatase TiO2 nanorod array was successfully prepared by the conversion from ZnO nanorod array immersed in a 75 mM ammonium hexafluorotitanate acid solution. The influence of different immersion time on the microstructure, crystal phase and light absorption of the anatase TiO2 nanorod arrays were systematically studied.

Abstract: Heat accumulators using latent heat storage are commonly used in solar energy storage systems. Potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate (Alum) is an inexpensive phase change material, but the high phase change temperature limits its application in heat accumulator. To address this limitation is controlling the melting temperature of Alum. In this study, Alum-urea mixtures were first developed by adding 10 wt% urea. Modified phase change materials (MPCM) without phase separation and supercooling were developed by adding NiSO4·6H2O and xanthan gum to the Alum-urea mixture. Composite phase change materials (CPCM) with high thermal conductivity were developed by loading MPCM in expanded graphite. The melting temperature of the Alum-urea mixture was 72.52 °C with 10 wt% urea content, which was 21.4% lower compared to the Alum. The MPCM still has a high phase change enthalpy (157.7 J·g−1) and ignorable subcooling degree (0.8 °C). The thermal conductivity of CPCM is increased by 16 times, and it has good photothermal conversion ability. The CPCM holds significant promise for applications in latent heat energy storage.

Abstract: Indium tin oxide (ITO) and intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO) are usually used as the window layer of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells within a typical structure. The optoelectronic properties of the window layer play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of solar cells. In this work, two types of CZTSSe solar cells with and without i-ZnO layers were fabricated using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvents, respectively. The impact of the window layer on the performance of CZTSSe solar cells was investigated. The results suggest that the device without i-ZnO still exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to conventional bilayer i-ZnO/ITO structures. By removing i-ZnO and optimizing the thickness of ITO, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DMSO and DMF-based CZTSSe solar cells has been up to 10.17% and 10.27%, respectively, with an increase in open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 15 mV (in DMSO system) and 10 mV (in DMF system), as well as an enhancement in fill factor (FF) by ∼5 percentage points. These performance improvements are mainly attributed to the reduction of series resistance (Rs) of the window layer due to the removal of i-ZnO layer. Further analysis shows that the generation and collection of photon-generated carriers in CZTSSe solar cells can be affected by the optimized window layer due to optical interference effects and its resistance. Our research may provide insights for the preparation of high efficient CZTSSe solar cells with new structures of the i-ZnO free window layer.

Abstract: This paper reports on a novel display device with a colorless transparent state that exhibits both blue emission based on alternating current (AC)-driven electrochemiluminescence and multicoloration based on silver-electrodeposited electrochromic (EC) systems in a single device. The device consists of a gel electrolyte composed of 9,10-diphenylanthracene and silver nitrate sandwiched between a pair of transparent electrodes. When a direct current (DC) voltage of −2.8 V was applied to the device, a mirror state was observed with a large change in reflectance due to film-like silver deposition on the electrode, and when the voltage was increased to −3.5 V, a black state was observed with decreasing transmittance and reflectance. The EC reactions in both states exhibited excellent switching stability. Moreover, this device can exhibit chromatic color by controlling the localized surface plasmon resonance of the silver nanoparticle deposits. Furthermore, applying an AC voltage of ±3.5 V, 50 Hz, blue emission was also exhibited.

Abstract: Precious and scarce silver (Ag) is used as a front electrical contact in silicon solar panels. With massive amounts of solar panel waste coming to end-of-life, it is imperative to recover all the Ag from these modules. In this paper, we propose a novel method to easily reclaim Ag from end-of-life silicon solar cells using low concentration sulfuric acid (H2SO4) leaching followed by ultrasonication. Our process simplifies the Ag recycling procedure by directly recovering the Ag contacts from solar cells, eliminating the need for secondary precipitation/electrodeposition. First, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the leaching and ultrasonication process on rejected solar wafers. Next, a solar panel from landfill was heated in a furnace to burn off the polymer encapsulant. The silicon wafers were then collected from the burning process and leached in 2 M H2SO4 at two different shaking speeds for 48 h at room temperature. Finally, the end-of-life silicon wafer pieces were collected, sonicated in water, and then the sonication water was centrifuged to show a proof-of-concept to recover the Ag contacts. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES) is used to monitor dissolved elements in the leachate as a function of time and shaking speed. XPS is used to evaluate the composition of the silicon cell wafer surface before and after H2SO4 leaching. SEM is used to image the recovered Ag contacts morphology and EDX confirms the recovered particles contain high amounts of Ag. A proposed schematic illustrates the authors’ hypothesis for the peeling mechanism.

Abstract: Many novel molten salts and their based nanofluids have been proposed, and their thermophysical properties have been extensively studied. However, their implications to performance and economic of concentrated solar power (CSP) systems are not well understood. This study has compared the performance of CSP generation systems by applying nitrate, carbonate, chloride and their based nanofluids. Based on the selected site of the study, Delingha City, Qinghai Province of China, different heat transfer fluids (HTFs) were applied to both parabolic trough collectors (PTC) systems and solar power tower (SPT) systems upon on their maximum operating temperatures. The solar multiple (SM) and thermal energy storage full-load hours of solar salt PTC and SPT systems were determined as the benchmarks, and then the results in each CSP system were compared to the benchmarks at annual, monthly and daily time scales, respectively. The results show that by comparing against the solar salt PTC systems with other HTFs, the nitrate nanofluid PTC system has the best performance, owing to an increase of 21.68% in its annual electricity generation (AEG) and an improvement of 6.0% in capacity factor (CF); among the five SPT systems, on the other hand, the performance of carbonate nanofluid SPT system is the best, and its AEG and CF are improved by 24.47% and 13.15% respectively while comparing with the solar salt SPT system. This work lends a fresh perspective to design and evaluate new CSP systems applying advanced molten salts and their based nanofluids.

Abstract: Molten carbonate salt nanofluids have become an excellent strategy to enhance the power generation efficiency of the next-generation concentrated solar power (CSP) technology due to their excellent thermophysical properties at high temperatures. The corrosion behaviour in contact with salt nanofluids is one of the main issues to address for implementing cost-effective steels as construction materials for CSP. In the present work, the effects of molten salt nanofluids with Al2O3 nanoparticles (<50 nm and 1.0 wt%) on the corrosion behaviour of AISI 301LN stainless steel have been investigated. Corrosion tests were carried out in a static molten salt mixture of Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 at 600 °C for 1000 h. Complementary electron microscopy, microanalysis and optical characterization techniques and micromechanical tests were carried out to study the oxide scales formed after corrosion tests in salt nanofluids and base salt of reference. Results evidenced that doping nanoparticles in molten salts significantly decreased the corrosion rate by ∼50%, compared with a base salt. Incorporating nanoparticles into the oxide scale, forming a nanostructure of reticulated Al2O3 nanoparticles generated a more homogeneous and dense oxide scale, increasing its hardness about 30% and enhancing its effectiveness as a protective barrier.

Abstract: Flexible and lightweight photovoltaics have attracted great attention in recent years owing to their application in wearable and portable electronic devices. However, the use of polymer substrates obstructs the fabrication of highly efficient and stable devices due to their limitations like low transmittance, poor temperature tolerance, photodegradation, high material cost, etc. In addition, conventional flexible transparent electrodes (TEs) such as indium tin oxide (ITO) deposited on polymeric substrates have poor electro-optical properties compared to their glass counterpart and are still brittle, which not only negatively affect the performance but also the flexibility/bendability. Here in this work, a kitchen-grade aluminium foil providing a lightweight, low-cost, mechanically flexible substrate-cum-electrode has been utilized for the very first time in the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Also, an indium-free, oxide-metal-oxide (OMO) based TE exhibiting a sheet resistance below 6 Ω/□ and an average visible transmittance above 80% is used as a top TE. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10% is obtained with a high power per unit weight of over 3.5 W/g, which is much higher than conventional solar cells. The present work traces a way towards the fabrication of lightweight and flexible photovoltaic/optoelectronic devices by incorporation of metallic foil as substrate-cum-electrode.

Abstract: Tujia ethnomedicine Xuetong (the stems of Kadsura heteroclita) have been widely used in folk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can alleviate rheumatic pain through liquor soaking in folk. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanism of Xuetongsu (a key chemical component of Xuetong) on bone destruction. In our previous study, it was found that Xuetong extract can reduce adjuvant arthritic rats paw swelling and inhibit inflammatory factors in serum. Furthermore, Xuetongsu has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes, but its potential to inhibit bone destruction has not been explored. To address this, we employed the STRING database to predict protein interactions and utilized Autodock software to simulate the binding of Xuetongsu to target proteins. In this study, administration of Xuetongsu significantly alleviated paw swelling and bone destruction in C57BL/6 mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Mechanistic studies have indicated that Xuetongsu promotes apoptosis of mature osteoclasts in joint tissues by activating Caspase-3 and Bax, while inhibiting Bcl-2. Additionally, Xuetongsu inhibits osteoclast differentiation by suppressing RANKL, RANK, P-NF-κB, and NFATc1, and reduces bone resorption activity by inhibiting MMP-9, CTSK, and TRAP. Importantly, Xuetongsu exhibits good biocompatibility in major organs of mice. In summary, Xuetongsu has the potential to treat bone destruction by promoting apoptosis of mature osteoclasts, inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, and reducing bone resorption. This study reveals the pharmacological effects of Xuetongsu and its mechanism of action, which may contribute to the development of novel approaches for treating RA.

Abstract: The development of low-cost, high-performance transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts is essential for producing hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Here, we report a N-doped three-dimensional nanocarbon framework encapsulating heterojunction CoP–MoP nanoparticles. Due to the synergistic effect between the bimetals, electron transfer is enhanced at multiple heterogeneous junctions, resulting in highly efficient acid electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, the introduction of N-doped carbon material not only improves the conductivity of the catalyst, but also effectively prevents the aggregation of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles, thus exposing more active sites. Notably, CoP–MoP/NC demonstrates HER catalytic activity comparable to 20% Pt/C in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Furthermore, it exhibits a significantly low overpotential and a small Tafel slope, measuring 105.2 mV and 79.7 mV dec−1, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. And the catalyst also shows excellent long-term durability, further highlighting its potential as a high-performance HER electrocatalyst.

Abstract: Thousand and one amino acid kinase 1 (TAOK1) is a sterile 20 family Serine/Threonine kinase linked to microtubule dynamics, checkpoint signaling, DNA damage response, and neurological functions. Molecular-level alterations of TAOK1 have been associated with neurodevelopment disorders and cancers. Despite their known involvement in physiological and pathophysiological processes, and as a core member of the hippo signaling pathway, the phosphoregulatory network of TAOK1 has not been visualized. Aimed to explore this network, we first analyzed the predominantly detected and differentially regulated TAOK1 phosphosites in global phosphoproteome datasets across diverse experimental conditions. Based on 709 qualitative and 210 quantitative differential cellular phosphoproteome datasets that were systematically assembled, we identified that phosphorylation at Ser421, Ser9, Ser965, and Ser445 predominantly represented TAOK1 in almost 75% of these datasets. Surprisingly, the functional role of all these phosphosites in TAOK1 remains unexplored. Hence, we employed a robust strategy to extract the phosphosites in proteins that significantly correlated in expression with predominant TAOK1 phosphosites. This led to the first categorization of the phosphosites including those in the currently known and predicted interactors, kinases, and substrates, that positively/negatively correlated with the expression status of each predominant TAOK1 phosphosites. Subsequently, we also analyzed the phosphosites in core proteins of the hippo signaling pathway. Based on the TAOK1 phosphoregulatory network analysis, we inferred the potential role of the predominant TAOK1 phosphosites. Especially, we propose pSer9 as an autophosphorylation and TAOK1 kinase activity-associated phosphosite and pS421, the most frequently detected phosphosite in TAOK1, as a significant regulatory phosphosite involved in the maintenance of genome integrity. Considering that the impact of all phosphosites that predominantly represent each kinase is essential for the efficient interpretation of global phosphoproteome datasets, we believe that the approach undertaken in this study is suitable to be extended to other kinases for accelerated research.

Abstract: Polyolefin elastomers (POEs) have recently been introduced in the photovoltaic (PV) industry, addressing the requirements of advanced cell concepts and mitigating novel degradation phenomena in bifacial modules. Notable for their high volume resistivity, low permeation, and processability, POEs offer advantages such as the absence of harmful by-products like acetic acid upon humidity exposure. However, adapting standard measurement methods becomes imperative, as the crosslinking behavior of POEs may differ significantly from ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA). This study aims to examine the crosslinking behavior of POEs, with the ultimate goal of exploring the lamination process window. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Soxhlet extraction have been employed to characterize the crosslinking rate and chemical structure of various POE encapsulants. Notably, we obtained remarkable correlations between these two techniques for two commercially available POEs, allowing the extension of the IEC standard to new encapsulants. We further devise a recommendation to adapt the IEC62788-1-6 standard on crosslinking rate measurement. The prolongation of the standardized Soxhlet extraction duration to min. 24 h is demonstrated as an optimum given that most POEs have a lower target gel content value in comparison to EVA. The presented methodology demonstrates that fast feedback DSC analysis, when calibrated to material-specific curves, can provide quantitative and accurate results. One of the many possible practical implications of this insight is to encourage encapsulant suppliers to establish correlation graph for their material, and hence assisting improved accuracy in lamination development and quality control.

Abstract: The efficiency of the perovskite layer generally determines the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) depend highly on the layer's morphology, crystalline structure, and surface defect of their power conversion efficiency (PCE), and long-term stability. Introducing appropriate solvent additives to the perovskite precursor solution effectively controls the film structure, defect passivation, and grain boundaries. In this work, alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA), ethanol, and methanol (a nontoxic, sustainable, and low-cost alcohol) are used as green solvent additives to enhance the quality and morphology of perovskite films and to control nonradiative recombination in the PSCs. The alcohol adducts containing OH groups have interacted with organic cations and Pb ions to produce PbO, which reduces the concentration of halide vacancies, enhances charge transfer, and decreases nonradiative recombination. Alcohol additives can produce homogeneous, highly crystalline perovskite films with improved charge transfer and reduced recombination. Using the best alcohol additive, IPA, provides power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.41% and greater ambient air stability, as it keeps more than 82% of its original PCE after 1000 h. Furthermore, IPA additive-based PSCs retain 81% and 80% of their original efficiencies after 500 and 350 h of continuous light irradiation and heating at 85 °C.

Abstract: This work concerns the development of a nitrate salt based form-stable composite phase change material by cold sintering technology with the employment of diatomite as skeleton substance. Such fabrication strategy has never before been reported in the literature and we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of salt-diatomite composite production through a cold sintering process by means of sodium hydroxide solution as sintering additive. The microstructural characteristics and development mechanism, chemical and physical compatibility, mechanical strength, phase change behaviour, thermal and shape stability of the composite are investigated to reveal the structure formation and densification mechanism of salt and diatomite. The results show that the composite could be sintered at a temperature of 180 °C, far lower than that required in the traditional hot sintering approach. Due to the congruent solubility of the salt and diatomite in aqueous alkali, a rigid and dense structure induced by a so-called dissolution-precipitation process could be generated in the composite, which provides solution to accommodate the salt, endowing the composite with splendid capacity to maintain the structure stability and restrain the liquid leakage over the phase change process. An excellent chemical and physical compatibility has been achieved between the salt and other components, and over 60 wt% salt could be encapsulated in the composite by which a melting temperature around 278 °C and an energy storage density over 650 kJ/kg at a temperature range of 50–600 °C are attained. The results also reveal that the composite exhibits preeminent mechanical strength and excellent thermal cycling performance. For a given cycling temperature range of 50–500 °C, a stable macroscopic shape with a compressive strength over 210 MPa could be achieved in the composite even after 100 times of thermal cycles.

Abstract: Efforts are driven to fast-track energy transition for more energy security, resilience, and affordable energy for all. A major objective in implementing the transition to renewable energies is the overall reduction of the global warming potential (GWP). Therefore, it is important to investigate key parameters that can reduce the GWP of renewable energy technologies even further. In this study, the GWP of a state-of-the-art, market-dominating passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) in a glass-backsheet photovoltaic (PV) module based on Czochralski (Cz) grown silicon wafers is explored to determine the influence of up-to-date electricity mix of the production location, the installation location as well as the lifetime. This comprehensive analysis showed a GWP reduction potential of approximately 62% only through strategic planning of the upstream production location of each life cycle phase. Additionally, approximately 58% of the GWP reduction potential is observed by changing the downstream installation location and lifetime of the PV modules. Furthermore, this study promotes and provides guidelines for modelling the correct electricity mix in the correct voltage composition, which is important to precisely portray time representativeness of the grid electricity in LCA of any production process but rarely used in practice. Lastly, the study provides opportunities for solar cell manufacturers to create a more sustainable product by strategically reducing their product's GWP through changes in the electricity mix of the supply chain location.

Abstract: Disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (Na2HPO4•12H2O, DHPD), a typical inorganic hydrated salt phase change material (PCM), is widely utilized for thermal energy storage. However, the key challenges such as significant supercooling, easy phase separation, easy leakage, and limited photothermal conversion capability restrict its actual application. Herein, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was adopted for the first time as a nucleating agent to suppress or eliminate the supercooling degree of DHPD. The inclusion of ultraviolet light-curable polyurethane acrylate (UV-curable-PUA) as an encapsulation medium effectively addresses issues related to phase separation and easy leakage within the DHPD-PEG PCM (DHPDP). In addition, polydopamine (PDA) was introduced as a proficient solar absorber to significantly augment the photothermal conversion performance of DHPDP@PUA/PDA phase change composites (DPPCCs). The results demonstrate that the addition of 2% PEG4000 can effectively minimize the supercooling degree of DHPD to 0.37 °C. Moreover, DPPCCs exhibit favorable tensile strength (1.9 MPa) and elongation at break (31.1%). Remarkably, after undergoing 200 cycles, the enthalpy only decreases by 2.6%. Furthermore, the photothermal conversion performance of DPPCCs is significantly enhanced compared to DHPDP@PUA. In conclusion, the prepared DPPCCs hold great promise for efficient thermal energy storage.

Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in using thermoplasmonics effect of metallic nanoparticles to increase the rate of chemical reactions. However, it remains a challenge to separate out the role of thermoplasmonics effect from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). In this work, Au@SiO2/TiO2 with different SiO2 shell thicknesses (2, 3, 4, and 5 nm) are prepared as plasmonic composite photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Their electric and temperature field distributions are calculated by coupling the wave optics and the heat transfer modules in the COMSOL software. The decoupling of the LSPR relaxation mechanism of hot electron injection and thermoplasmonics effect is achieved by adjusting the SiO2 shell thickness. When the SiO2 thickness reaches 4 nm, the transmission process of the hot electrons produced by Au nanoparticles to TiO2 is completely hindered, and the thermoplasmonics effect is retained. By comparing the activities of Au@SiO2-4/TiO2 with Au/TiO2, the relative contribution of thermoplasmonics effect can be estimated to be 36 % in PEC water splitting.

Abstract: Selective absorbers play a crucial role in harvesting solar energy and realizing effective solar-thermal energy conversion in concentrated solar power systems and thermophotovoltaic systems. This study focuses on obtaining a high-temperature solar selective absorber which can well balance its thermal performance as well as structural complexity. Based on this, a selective absorber with simple one-dimensional multilayer nanostructures is designed to adapt to the high-temperature operation environments. The obtained absorber exhibits a total solar absorptance of 0.9504 to the AM1.5 solar radiation. Taking into account the infrared radiation loss, the solar-thermal efficiency of the absorber is found to be 91.2% under 1000 suns at 1273 K, and the total emittance is 0.1504 at the corresponding temperature. The absorber shows high insensitivity to both incident polarization angles and wide-angle incidence. Analysis of impedance and electromagnetic field distribution indicates that the selective absorption performance of the absorber is attributed to its impedance matching properties, resulting from the coupling effect of surface plasmon polaritons and magnetic polaritons.

Abstract: A solar-pumped laser with bulk active medium generally requires a considerable amount of concentrated solar power for initiating laser emission. In previous work, 54.9 W threshold incoming solar power was found for a Ce:Nd:YAG solar laser by a 0.075 m2 effective area parabolic mirror. In the present work, a 0.0615 m2 area Fresnel lens was used to concentrate incoming solar power to a 2 mm diameter, 30 mm length Ce:Nd:YAG rod. 1.81 W continuous-wave 1064 nm solar laser output power was measured, corresponding to 3.15% solar-to-laser conversion efficiency, 4.4% laser slope efficiency, and 29.4 W/m2 collection efficiency. More importantly, threshold incoming solar power as low as 16.5 W was achieved, representing a 3.33 times reduction in threshold solar power, as compared to previous record by the parabolic mirror. By using a 0.0855 m2 area Fresnel lens, 2.83 W solar laser power was also measured, leading to 3.56% solar-to-laser conversion efficiency, 4.9% laser slope efficiency, and 33.1 W/m2 collection efficiency. Low threshold incoming solar power of 22.7W was also obtained, representing a 2.42 times reduction in threshold solar power in relation to the previous record. Notably, 1.41 W TEM00 mode solar laser power was also measured by adopting an asymmetric laser resonant cavity, resulting in 2.06% solar-to-TEM00 mode laser conversion efficiency, which, to the best of our knowledge, is 2.61 times larger than the previous record by Nd:YAG medium.

Abstract: Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a high incidence and poor prognosis; however, no effective treatment is currently available. Our previous study found that the improvement effect of the herb pair of Rhubarb-Astragalus on CKD is likely related to the inhibition of the TGF-β1/p38-MAPK pathway. In the present study, a p38-MAPK inhibitor was used to further investigate the inhibitory effect of Rhubarb-Astragalus on the TGF-β1/p38-MAPK pathway and its relationship with autophagy.
Methods
A rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) was established, and a subgroup of rats was administered Rhubarb-Astragalus. Renal function and renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) were assessed 21 d after UUO induction. In vitro, HK-2 cells were treated with TGF-β1 and a subset of cells were treated with Rhubarb-Astragalus or p38-MAPK inhibitor. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR analyses were used to detect the relevant protein and mRNA levels. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe autophagosomes.
Results
Rhubarb-Astragalus treatment markedly decreased the elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase; attenuated renal damage and RIF induced by UUO; and reduced the number of autophagosomes and lysosomes in UUO-induced renal tissues. Additionally, Rhubarb-Astragalus reduced the protein and mRNA levels of α-SMA, collagen I, LC3, Atg3, TGF-β1, p38-MAPK, smad2/3, and TAK1 in renal tissues of UUO rats. Rhubarb-Astragalus also reduced protein and mRNA levels of these indicators in vitro. Importantly, the effect of the p38-MAPK inhibitor was similar to that of Rhubarb-Astragalus.
Conclusions
Rhubarb-Astragalus improves CKD possibly by downregulating autophagy via the p38-MAPK/TGF-β1 and p38-MAPK/smad2/3 pathways.

Abstract: A functional large-area transparent conductor (TC), consisting of two-dimensional (2D) Ag films sandwiched within indium tin oxide (ITO) layers has been developed for use in transparent photovoltaics (TPV) applications. This innovative solution harnesses the potential of 2D Ag films, which play a pivotal role in the creation of cost-effective optoelectronic devices with a focus on attributes like lightness, optical transparency, and compactness. The gained attention in 2D Ag film technology originates from the possibility of forming highly transparent, conducting film with an ultrathin Ag layer. Large-scale, uniform 2D Ag is commonly achieved by sputtering technique, limiting its application as the electrical window for thin-film optoelectronics attributed to the bombardment of high-energetic sputtered materials. The present study proposes a low-damage, sputtering procedure to utilize 2D Ag for electrical windows of Cu2O-based photovoltaics. A high surface-energy dielectric material, ITO, is adopted as a wetting platform for Ag film evolution, providing continuous Ag thin-film with a total transparency of 93% and sheet resistance of 4 Ω sq−1. Importantly, ITO is explored as the interfacial layer to reduce the kinetic impact of sputtered Ag particles on Cu2O photo-absorber, enabling the development of large-scale Cu2O-based TPV (transparency of 43.1%) with signified power to Cu2O thickness ratio of 1.7. The results are achieved by investigating variable power conditions on the electrostatics of Cu2O TPV. Furthermore, the proposed TC, ITO/Ag/ITO, enables efficient power extraction from Cu2O TPV with enhanced power conversion efficiency of 122% compared to conventional solution-processed AgNW TC.

Abstract: There is growing evidence of an elevated risk of lung cancer in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The poor prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer and the lack of therapeutic options pose an even greater challenge to the clinical management of patients. This study aimed to identify potential molecular targets associated with the progression of rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer and examine the efficacy of naringenin nanoparticles targeting cyclin B1. Mendelian randomizatio analysis revealed that rheumatoid arthritis has a positive correlation with the risk of lung cancer. Cyclin B1 was significantly upregulated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer and was significantly overexpressed in synovial tissue fibroblasts. Furthermore, the overexpression of cyclin B1 in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes, which promotes their proliferation and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, can significantly contribute to the growth and infiltration of lung cancer cells. Importantly, our prepared naringenin nanoparticles targeting cyclin B1 effectively attenuated proliferation and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition by blocking cells at the G2/M phase. In vivo experiments, naringenin nanoparticles targeting cyclin B1 significantly alleviated the development of collagen-induced arthritis and lung orthotopic tumors. Collectively, our results reveal that naringenin nanoparticles targeting cyclin B1 can suppress the progression of rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer by inhibiting fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. These findings provide new insights into the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis-associated lung cancer therapy.

Abstract: Radiative cooling is a carbon-free, zero energy technology that can substitute various energy-consuming cooling systems such as air conditioners and auto-chillers for cooling heat-generating machines. Previous reports on radiative cooling have focused mainly on the cooling performance, thereby overlooking the applicability, structural complexity, manufacturing complexity, and certain physical properties of the cooler. In this study, we present an efficient, applicable, and facile-fabricated radiative cooler composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propene) (P(VDF-HFP)) and alumina (Al2O3). Apart from being fabricated in the form of a freestanding sheet with 97.5% solar reflectance and 94.8% infrared (IR) emissivity, the P(VDF-HFP)/Al2O3-based radiative cooler (PARC) can be applied to various solid substrates via simple coating techniques. This shows that the PARC can be introduced in architecture, clothing, and other fields that demand cooling. The cooling performance of PARC is experimentally proven by a sub-ambient temperature drop of 10.1 °C during daytime and the cooling power of the PARC is calculated to be 125.6 Wm-2 under the AM1.5 global spectrum, which is superior to that of previously reported radiative cooling emitters.

Abstract: Passive daytime radiative cooling is an eco-friendly and cost-efficient cooling strategy that is achieved by selectively reflecting the solar irradiance and emitting heat to cold background of the universe through the atmospheric window (AW) at infrared wavelengths. The daytime radiative coolers traditionally exhibit a grey or white color due to the requirement of high solar irradiance reflectance. Here, we present a colored daytime radiative cooler (CDRC) that has high reflectance in the NIR, high emissivity in the AW, and the capability to generate subtractive primary colors based on Fabry-Pérot interference using metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structures. The structural parameters of the MIM multilayers are inversely designed using tandem neural networks to achieve cooling powers of 11.2–38.2 W/m2 with on-demand color generation. The proposed CDRCs have potential to be used for cooling thermal sensitive electronic and optoelectronic devices and aesthetic applications.

Abstract: Polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells are widely studied for their application in thin-film photovoltaics, but analysis of their crystalline properties is difficult owing to the presence of grain boundaries and defects. Epitaxial CIGS (epi-CIGS) solar cells can potentially address the issues of polycrystalline CIGS (poly-CIGS) solar cells, but their conversion efficiency has not been widely studied. We fabricated epi-CIGS layers using techniques developed for high-efficiency ploy-CIGS solar cells such as Ga grading, Na doping, and heat-light soaking. Here, scanning transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry were used to compare the structural characteristics of poly- and epi-CIGS solar cells with conversion efficiencies of more than 21%. Both types of solar cells had similar Ga gradient profiles, and abrupt interfaces were observed between the CIGS and Mo, CIGS and GaAs, and CdS and CIGS layers. The poly-CIGS layer had a higher Na concentration than the epi-CIGS layer because the grain boundaries of the former included high concentrations of Na ions. Meanwhile, the Na ions in the epi-CIGS layer promoted the interdiffusion of In and Ga. For both types of solar cells, heat-light soaking increased the carrier concentration by more than 1 × 1017 cm−3. These observations suggest that grain boundaries are not the main factor limiting the conversion efficiency of poly-CIGS solar cells.

Abstract: Dust deposition on PV module surfaces is a complex issue influenced by various factors such as weather conditions, dust composition, and surface properties. Outdoor soiling experiments experience fluctuations in environmental conditions, leading to natural inconsistencies and difficulties in reproducibility. On the other hand, laboratory experiments can be conducted in a well-controlled environment and provide rapid results. This study aims to analyze and correlate outdoor and indoor soiling experiments using different anti-soiling coated glass samples. The outdoor experiments, conducted over a year at eight locations in Saudi Arabia, revealed significant variations in soiling behaviour. These were evaluated by assessing light transmission loss through optical transmission analysis. Indoor experiments were conducted in a controlled soiling test chamber and analyzed by optical microscopy to replicate the outdoor behaviour observed with different coating types. Dry laboratory tests followed by wind blow tests showed a strong correlation (Average Pearson r = 0.65) with outdoor soiling results for most locations. In contrast, heavy dew tests showed an anti-correlation with the outdoor soiling results. Therefore, it was also concluded that the resuspension is the primary removal mechanism affecting the performance of the Anti-Soiling Coatings (ASCs) in the dry environments.

Abstract: Compared with the traditional structure, the new Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell without ZnO window layer has a larger short-circuit current reduction. Due to the poor band matching, serious interface recombination exists at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction interface. We have designed a strategy for the preparation of CdS(In) buffer layers by In ion doping to increase the depletion layer width, enhance the carrier concentration in the CdS(In) buffer layer, and improve the energy band alignment problem at the interface of the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction, which in turn reduces the JSC loss caused by the removal of the ZnO layer. The energy band alignment of the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction was modulated by finely controlling the doping amount of In ions, which decreased the conduction band offset (CBO) from 0.32 eV to 0.28 eV. Good band alignment is more conducive to carrier separation and transport, and reducing the nonradiative charge recombination at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction interface can effectively improve the JSC. Based on the contribution of device electrical parameters to photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), the contributions of JSC, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor were calculated to be 107.56%, -6.89%, and -0.67%, respectively, which indicates that the method significantly improves short-circuit currents and reduces the loss of JSC due to the absence of ZnO layer. This study provides a method to achieve high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cells by optimizing the energy band matching of CZTSSe/CdS heterojunctions from 7.07% PCE in conventional cells to 9.01% PCE in novel cells.

Abstract: Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) has garnered attention for applications in smart window and thermal regulation. This work presents the preparation of an all-solid-state electrochromic device (ECD) based on Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and WO3 for optical and thermal regulation. Upon electrochemical stimulation, the LTO/WO3 composite demonstrates a synergetic effect on EC the properties of ECD in visible and IR wavelength. The IR emissivity modulation of the ECDs demonstrate a non-linear change with increasing the thickness of the LTO film, reaching a notable alteration in IR emissivity of 0.34 in the range of 2.5–25 μm. Meanwhile, the ECD reveals an impressive average transmittance modulation of over 60 % in the range of 400–1100 nm. This study exhibits the promising potential of Li4Ti5O12/WO3 composite-based ECD in the filed of optical and thermal management.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have gradually become the most attractive alternative for next-generation photovoltaic devices due to their excellent photovoltaic conversion efficiencies and low manufacturing costs. Defect engineering is an essential topic for improving the performance of perovskite devices. In this study, we utilize a bifunctional alkylamine sulfonate to modify the perovskite interfaces. The TsO− of sulfonates coordinates with Pb2+, while –NH2 of alkylamine forms hydrogen bonds with iodine, which reduces charge recombination and improves energy level arrangement. The molecular size and the alkylamine's dielectric constant significantly influence the interface modification performance. For the champion device with BATsO treatment, there is an enhancement in both the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.53%. After 400 h of working condition, the device maintains roughly 90.40% of its initial efficiency. Therefore, this study postulates that modifying bifunctional alkylamine sulfonates could effectively enhance the PSC's performance.

Abstract: The diagnosis and treatment of biliary atresia pose challenges due to the absence of reliable biomarkers and limited understanding of its etiology. The plasma and liver of patients with biliary atresia exhibit elevated levels of neurotensin. To investigate the specific role of neurotensin in the progression of biliary atresia, the patient's liver pathological section was employed. Biliary organoids, cultured biliary cells, and a mouse model were employed to elucidate both the potential diagnostic significance of neurotensin and its underlying mechanistic pathway. In patients’ blood, the levels of neurotensin were positively correlated with matrix metalloprotease-7, interleukin-8, and liver function enzymes. Neurotensin and neurotensin receptors were mainly expressed in the intrahepatic biliary cells and were stimulated by bile acids. Neurotensin suppressed the growth and increased expression of matrix metalloprotease-7 in biliary organoids. Neurotensin inhibited mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, and attenuated the activation of calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (CaMKK2-AMPK) signaling in cultured biliary cells. The stimulation of neurotensin in mice and cultured cholangiocytes resulted in the upregulation of matrix metalloprotease-7 expression through binding to its receptors, namely neurotensin receptors 1/3, thereby attenuating the activation of the CaMKK2-AMPK pathway. In conclusion, these findings revealed the changes of neurotensin in patients with cholestatic liver disease and its mechanism in the progression of the disease, providing a new understanding of the complex mechanism of hepatobiliary injury in children with biliary atresia.

Abstract: The impact of the bandgap (Eg) grading of an earth-abundant multinary chalcogenide Cu2BaSn(S1-xSex)4 (CBTSSe) is investigated using numerical simulation. The baseline model of the cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.17 % is designed to match the performance of the fabricated cell. The Eg tuning is performed by compositional variation of Sulfur (S) and Selenium (Se). We investigate the single grading of the absorber by thoroughly optimizing the Eg at the boundaries using linear grading. Double grading of the absorber is performed by employing a parabolic grading profile to vary Eg inside the bulk of the absorber. Major improvements are noticed in performance parameters wherein (a) Open circuit voltage (Voc) is improved from 0.67 to 0.91 V, (b) short circuit current density (Jsc) is improved from 16.4 to 21.28 mA/cm2 after appropriate grading of the absorber and (c) the PCE of the cell is enhanced from 6.17 to 15.63 %. The effects on the performance parameters with different grading profiles are briefly discussed. The defects with different distribution profiles are studied for graded device. The inherent formation of MoS2 and MoSe2 layers are discussed, and the PCE of cell is improved to 16.31% due to formation of ohmic junction. We further propose to modify the Mo back contact with Ni to improve the PCE of the device up to 17.53%. This work presents a systematic approach to optimize Eg of the absorber and boost the advancement in CBTSSe-based photovoltaic devices.
