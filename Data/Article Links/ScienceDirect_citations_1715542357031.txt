Abstract: Summary
Apical radial glia (aRGs) are predominant progenitors during corticogenesis. Perturbing their function leads to cortical malformations, including subcortical heterotopia (SH), characterized by the presence of neurons below the cortex. EML1/Eml1 mutations lead to SH in patients, as well as to heterotopic cortex (HeCo) mutant mice. In HeCo mice, some aRGs are abnormally positioned away from the ventricular zone (VZ). Thus, unraveling EML1/Eml1 function will clarify mechanisms maintaining aRGs in the VZ. We pinpoint an unknown EML1/Eml1 function in primary cilium formation. In HeCo aRGs, cilia are shorter, less numerous, and often found aberrantly oriented within vesicles. Patient fibroblasts and human cortical progenitors show similar defects. EML1 interacts with RPGRIP1L, a ciliary protein, and RPGRIP1L mutations were revealed in a heterotopia patient. We also identify Golgi apparatus abnormalities in EML1/Eml1 mutant cells, potentially upstream of the cilia phenotype. We thus reveal primary cilia mechanisms impacting aRG dynamics in physiological and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
R-loops are three-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids that are implicated in many nuclear processes. While R-loops may have physiological roles, the formation of stable, aberrant R-loops has been observed in neurological disorders and cancers. Current methods to assess their genome-wide distribution rely on affinity purification, which is plagued by large input requirements, high noise, and poor sensitivity for dynamic R-loops. Here, we present MapR, a method that utilizes RNase H to guide micrococcal nuclease to R-loops, which are subsequently cleaved, released, and identified by sequencing. MapR detects R-loops formed at promoters and active enhancers that are likely to form transient R-loops due to the low transcriptional output of these regulatory elements and the short-lived nature of enhancer RNAs. MapR is as specific as existing techniques and more sensitive, allowing for genome-wide coverage with low input material in a fraction of the time.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) originate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to store triacylglycerol (TG) and cholesterol esters. The ER protein seipin was shown to localize to ER-LD contacts soon after LDs form, but what determines the sites of initial LD biogenesis in the ER is unknown. Here, we identify TMEM159, now re-named lipid droplet assembly factor 1 (LDAF1), as an interaction partner of seipin. Together, LDAF1 and seipin form an ∼600 kDa oligomeric complex that copurifies with TG. LDs form at LDAF1-seipin complexes, and re-localization of LDAF1 to the plasma membrane co-recruits seipin and redirects LD formation to these sites. Once LDs form, LDAF1 dissociates from seipin and moves to the LD surface. In the absence of LDAF1, LDs form only at significantly higher cellular TG concentrations. Our data suggest that the LDAF1-seipin complex is the core protein machinery that facilitates LD biogenesis and determines the sites of their formation in the ER.

Abstract: Summary
Information from developmental signaling pathways must be accurately decoded to generate transcriptional outcomes. In the case of Notch, the intracellular domain (NICD) transduces the signal directly to the nucleus. How enhancers decipher NICD in the real time of developmental decisions is not known. Using the MS2-MCP system to visualize nascent transcripts in single cells in Drosophila embryos, we reveal how two target enhancers read Notch activity to produce synchronized and sustained profiles of transcription. By manipulating the levels of NICD and altering specific motifs within the enhancers, we uncover two key principles. First, increased NICD levels alter transcription by increasing duration rather than frequency of transcriptional bursts. Second, priming of enhancers by tissue-specific transcription factors is required for NICD to confer synchronized and sustained activity; in their absence, transcription is stochastic and bursty. The dynamic response of an individual enhancer to NICD thus differs depending on the cellular context.

Abstract: Summary
Id helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins (Id1–4) bind E protein bHLH transcription factors, preventing them from forming active transcription complexes that drive changes in cell states. Id proteins are primarily expressed during development to inhibit differentiation, but they become re-expressed in adult tissues in diseases of the vasculature and cancer. We show that the genetic loss of Id1/Id3 reduces ocular neovascularization in mouse models of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). An in silico screen identifies AGX51, a small-molecule Id antagonist. AGX51 inhibits the Id1-E47 interaction, leading to ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Ids, cell growth arrest, and reduced viability. AGX51 is well-tolerated in mice and phenocopies the genetic loss of Id expression in AMD and ROP models by inhibiting retinal neovascularization. Thus, AGX51 is a first-in-class compound that antagonizes an interaction formerly considered undruggable and that may have utility in the management of multiple diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The extreme metabolic demands of pregnancy require coordinated metabolic adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue homeostasis depends on precise yet plastic regulation of stem cell daughter fates. During growth, Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs) adjust fates by switching from asymmetric to symmetric lineages to scale the size of the ISC population. Using a combination of long-term live imaging, lineage tracing, and genetic perturbations, we demonstrate that this switch is executed through the control of mitotic spindle orientation by Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. JNK interacts with the WD40-repeat protein Wdr62 at the spindle and transcriptionally represses the kinesin Kif1a to promote planar spindle orientation. In stress conditions, this function becomes deleterious, resulting in overabundance of symmetric fates and contributing to the loss of tissue homeostasis in the aging animal. Restoring normal ISC spindle orientation by perturbing the JNK/Wdr62/Kif1a axis is sufficient to improve intestinal physiology and extend lifespan. Our findings reveal a critical role for the dynamic control of SC spindle orientation in epithelial maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a malignancy arising across multiple anatomical sites, is responsible for significant cancer mortality due to insufficient therapeutic options. Here, we identify exceptional glucose reliance among SCCs dictated by hyperactive GLUT1-mediated glucose influx. Mechanistically, squamous lineage transcription factors p63 and SOX2 transactivate the intronic enhancer cluster of SLC2A1. Elevated glucose influx fuels generation of NADPH and GSH, thereby heightening the anti-oxidative capacity in SCC tumors. Systemic glucose restriction by ketogenic diet and inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption with SGLT2 inhibitor precipitate intratumoral oxidative stress and tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, reduction of blood glucose lowers blood insulin levels, which suppresses PI3K/AKT signaling in SCC cells. Clinically, we demonstrate a robust correlation between blood glucose concentration and worse survival among SCC patients. Collectively, this study identifies the exceptional glucose reliance of SCC and suggests its candidacy as a highly vulnerable cancer type to be targeted by systemic glucose restriction.

Abstract: Summary
Recent evidence suggests that the eukaryotic metabolism is an autonomous oscillator. Together with oscillating elements of the cyclin/CDK machinery, this oscillator might form a coupled oscillator system, from which cell-cycle control emerges. The topology of interactions between the metabolic oscillator and the elements of the cyclin/CDK machinery, however, remains unknown. Using single-cell metabolic and cell-cycle dynamics in yeast, and solving an inverse problem with a system of Kuramoto oscillators, we inferred how the metabolic oscillator interacts with the cyclin/CDK machinery. The identified and experimentally validated interaction topology shows that the early and late cell cycle are independently driven by metabolism. While in this topology, the S phase is coordinated by START. We obtained no support for a strong interaction between early and late cell cycle. The identified high-level interaction topology will guide future efforts to discover the molecular links between metabolism and the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have a remarkable tropism in their ability to circulate in both mammalian and avian species. The IAV NS1 protein is a multifunctional virulence factor that inhibits the type I interferon host response through a myriad of mechanisms. How NS1 has evolved to enable this remarkable property across species and its specific impact in the overall replication, pathogenicity, and host preference remain unknown. Here we analyze the NS1 evolutionary landscape and host tropism using a barcoded library of recombinant IAVs. Results show a surprisingly great variety of NS1 phenotypes according to their ability to replicate in different hosts. The IAV NS1 genes appear to have taken diverse and random evolutionary pathways within their multiple phylogenetic lineages. In summary, the high evolutionary plasticity of this viral protein underscores the ability of IAVs to adapt to multiple hosts and aids in our understanding of its global prevalence.

Abstract: Calcification of soft tissue leads to serious diseases and has been associated with bacterial chronic infections. However, the origin and the molecular mechanisms of calcification remain unclear. Here we hypothesized that a human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa deposits extracellular calcium, a process requiring carbonic anhydrases (CAs). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the formation of 0.1-0.2 μm deposits by P. aeruginosa PAO1 growing at 5 mM CaCl2, and X-ray elemental analysis confirmed they contain calcium. Quantitative analysis of deposited calcium showed that PAO1 deposits 0.35 and 0.75 mM calcium/mg protein when grown at 5 mM and 10 mM CaCl2, correspondingly. Fluorescent microscopy indicated that deposition initiates at the cell surface. We have previously characterized three PAO1 β-class CAs: psCA1, psCA2, and psCA3 that hydrate CO2 to HCO3−, among which psCA1 showed the highest catalytic activity (Lotlikar et. al. 2013). According to immunoblot and RT-qPCR, growth at elevated calcium levels increases the expression of psCA1. Analyses of the deletion mutants lacking one, two or all three psCA genes, determined that psCA1 plays a major role in calcium deposition and contributes to the pathogen’s virulence. In-silico modeling of the PAO1 β-class CAs identified four amino acids that differ in psCA1 compared to psCA2, and psCA3 (T59, A61A, A101, and A108), and these differences may play a role in catalytic rate and thus calcium deposition. A series of inhibitors were tested against the recombinant psCA1, among which aminobenzene sulfonamide (ABS) and acetazolamide (AAZ), which inhibited psCA1 catalytic activity with KIs of 19 nM and 37 nM, correspondingly. The addition of ABS and AAZ to growing PAO1 reduced calcium deposition by 41 and 78, respectively. Hence, for the first time, we showed that the β-CA psCA1 in P. aeruginosa contributes to virulence likely by enabling calcium salt deposition, which can be partially controlled by inhibiting its catalytic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription is well known to be inherently stochastic and episodic, but the regulation of transcriptional dynamics is not well understood. Here, we analyze how Notch signaling modulates transcriptional bursting during animal development. Our focus is Notch regulation of transcription in germline stem cells of the nematode C. elegans. Using the MS2 system to visualize nascent transcripts and live imaging to record dynamics, we analyze bursting as a function of position within the intact animal. We find that Notch-dependent transcriptional activation is indeed “bursty”; that wild-type Notch modulates burst duration (ON-time) rather than duration of pauses between bursts (OFF-time) or mean burst intensity; and that a mutant Notch receptor, which is compromised for assembly into the Notch transcription factor complex, primarily modifies burst size (duration × intensity). These analyses thus visualize the effect of a canonical signaling pathway on metazoan transcriptional bursting in its native context.

Abstract: Summary
DDX17, a DEAD-box ATPase, is a multifunctional helicase important for various RNA functions, including microRNA maturation. Key questions for DDX17 include how it recognizes target RNAs and influences their structures, as well as how its ATPase activity may be regulated. Through crystal structures and biochemical assays, we show the ability of the core catalytic domains of DDX17 to recognize specific sequences in target RNAs. The RNA sequence preference of the catalytic core is critical for DDX17 to directly bind and remodel a specific region of primary microRNAs 3′ to the mature sequence, and consequently enhance processing by Drosha. Furthermore, we identify an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal tail and the DEAD domain of DDX17 to have an autoregulatory role in controlling the ATPase activity. Thus, we provide the molecular basis for how cognate RNA recognition and functional outcomes are linked for DDX17.

Abstract: Summary
The Ras GTPases are frequently mutated in human cancer, and, although the Raf kinases are essential effectors of Ras signaling, the tumorigenic properties of specific Ras-Raf complexes are not well characterized. Here, we examine the ability of individual Ras and Raf proteins to interact in live cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technology. We find that C-Raf binds all mutant Ras proteins with high affinity, whereas B-Raf exhibits a striking preference for mutant K-Ras. This selectivity is mediated by the acidic, N-terminal segment of B-Raf and requires the K-Ras polybasic region for high-affinity binding. In addition, we find that C-Raf is critical for mutant H-Ras-driven signaling and that events stabilizing B-Raf/C-Raf dimerization, such as Raf inhibitor treatment or certain B-Raf mutations, can allow mutant H-Ras to engage B-Raf with increased affinity to promote tumorigenesis, thus revealing a previously unappreciated role for C-Raf in potentiating B-Raf function.

Abstract: Sink strength optimizes sucrose import, which is fundamental to support developing seed grains and increase crop yields, including those of rice (Oryza sativa). In this regard, little is known about the function of vacuolar invertase (VIN) in controlling sink strength and thereby seed size. Here, in rice we analyzed mutants of two VINs, OsVIN1 and OsVIN2, to examine their role during seed development. In a phenotypic analysis of the T-DNA insertion mutants, only the OsVIN2 mutant osvin2-1 exhibited reduced seed size and grain weight. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the small seed grains of osvin2-1 can be attributed to a reduction in spikelet size. A significant decrease in VIN activity and hexose level in the osvin2-1 spikelets interfered with spikelet growth. In addition, significant reduction in starch and increase in sucrose, which are characteristic features of reduced turnover and flux of sucrose due to impaired sink strength, were evident in the pre-storage stage of osvin2-1 developing grains. In situ hybridization analysis found that expression of OsVIN2 was predominant in the endocarp of developing grains. A genetically complemented line with a native genomic clone of OsVIN2 rescued reduced VIN activity and seed size. Two additional mutants, osvin2-2 and osvin2-3 generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 method, exhibited phenotypes similar to those of osvin2-1 in spikelet and seed size, VIN activity, and sugar metabolites. These results clearly demonstrate an important role of OsVIN2 as sink strength modulator that is critical for the maintenance of sucrose flux into developing seed grains.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal cancer resistant to immunotherapy. We create a PDA mouse model and show that neoantigen expression is required for intratumoral T cell accumulation and response to immune checkpoint blockade. By generating a peptide:MHC tetramer, we identify that PDA induces rapid intratumoral, and progressive systemic, tumor-specific T cell exhaustion. Monotherapy PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade enhances systemic T cell expansion and induces objective responses that require systemic T cells. However, tumor escape variants defective in IFNγ-inducible Tap1 and MHC class I cell surface expression ultimately emerge. Combination PD-1 + PD-L1 blockade synergizes therapeutically by increasing intratumoral KLRG1+Lag3−TNFα+ tumor-specific T cells and generating memory T cells capable of expanding to spontaneous tumor recurrence, thereby prolonging animal survival. Our studies support that PD-1 and PD-L1 are relevant immune checkpoints in PDA and identify a combination for clinical testing in those patients with neoantigen-specific T cells.

Abstract: Summary
The Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt/β-Catenin (Wnt) cascades are morphogen pathways whose pronounced influence on adult liver metabolism has been identified in recent years. How both pathways communicate and control liver metabolic functions are largely unknown. Detecting core components of Wnt and Hh signaling and mathematical modeling showed that both pathways in healthy liver act largely complementary to each other in the pericentral (Wnt) and the periportal zone (Hh) and communicate mainly by mutual repression. The Wnt/Hh module inversely controls the spatiotemporal operation of various liver metabolic pathways, as revealed by transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses. Shifting the balance to Wnt (activation) or Hh (inhibition) causes pericentralization and periportalization of liver functions, respectively. Thus, homeostasis of the Wnt/Hh module is essential for maintaining proper liver metabolism and to avoid the development of certain metabolic diseases. With caution due to minor species-specific differences, these conclusions may hold for human liver as well.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle cell (myofiber) atrophy is a detrimental component of aging and cancer that primarily results from muscle protein degradation via the proteasome and ubiquitin ligases. Transcriptional upregulation of some ubiquitin ligases contributes to myofiber atrophy, but little is known about the role that most other ubiquitin ligases play in this process. To address this question, we have used RNAi screening in Drosophila to identify the function of > 320 evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin ligases in myofiber size regulation in vivo. We find that whereas RNAi for some ubiquitin ligases induces myofiber atrophy, loss of others (including the N-end rule ubiquitin ligase UBR4) promotes hypertrophy. In Drosophila and mouse myofibers, loss of UBR4 induces hypertrophy via decreased ubiquitination and degradation of a core set of target proteins, including the HAT1/RBBP4/RBBP7 histone-binding complex. Together, this study defines the repertoire of ubiquitin ligases that regulate myofiber size and the role of UBR4 in myofiber hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
In development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis, vertebrate cells move through 3D interstitial matrix, responding to chemical and physical guidance cues. Protrusion at the cell front has been extensively studied, but the retraction phase of the migration cycle is not well understood. Here, we show that fast-moving cells guided by matrix cues establish positive feedback control of rear retraction by sensing membrane tension. We reveal a mechanism of rear retraction in 3D matrix and durotaxis controlled by caveolae, which form in response to low membrane tension at the cell rear. Caveolae activate RhoA-ROCK1/PKN2 signaling via the RhoA guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Ect2 to control local F-actin organization and contractility in this subcellular region and promote translocation of the cell rear. A positive feedback loop between cytoskeletal signaling and membrane tension leads to rapid retraction to complete the migration cycle in fast-moving cells, providing directional memory to drive persistent cell migration in complex matrices.

Abstract: Summary
Under food deprivation conditions, Drosophila larvae exhibit increases in locomotor speed and synaptic bouton numbers at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline, plays critical roles in this process; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We show here that a glypican (Dlp) negatively regulates type I synaptic bouton formation, postsynaptic expression of GluRIIA, and larval locomotor speed. Starvation-induced octopaminergic signaling decreases Dlp expression, leading to increases in synapse formation and locomotion. Dlp is expressed by postsynaptic muscle cells and suppresses the non-canonical BMP pathway, which is composed of the presynaptic BMP receptor Wit and postsynaptic GluRIIA-containing ionotropic glutamate receptor. We find that during starvation, decreases in Dlp increase non-canonical BMP signaling, leading to increases in GluRIIA expression, type I bouton number, and locomotor speed. Our results demonstrate that octopamine controls starvation-induced neural plasticity by regulating Dlp and provides insights into how proteoglycans can influence behavioral and synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like chains are finely balanced by conjugating and de-conjugating enzymes. Alterations in this balance trigger the response to stress conditions and are often observed in pathologies. How such changes are detected is not well understood. We identify the HSP70 chaperone as a sensor of changes in the balance between mono- and poly-NEDDylation. Upon DNA damage, the induction of the de-NEDDylating enzyme NEDP1 restricts the formation of NEDD8 chains, mainly through lysines K11/K48. This promotes APAF1 oligomerization and apoptosis induction, a step that requires the HSP70 ATPase activity. HSP70 binds to NEDD8, and, in vitro, the conversion of NEDD8 chains into mono-NEDD8 stimulates HSP70 ATPase activity. This effect is independent of NEDD8 conjugation onto substrates. The study indicates that the NEDD8 cycle is a regulatory module of HSP70 function. These findings may be important in tumorigenesis, as we find decreased NEDP1 levels in hepatocellular carcinoma with concomitant accumulation of NEDD8 conjugates.

Abstract: Summary
Sensing of cytoplasmic DNA by cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) results in production of the dinucleotide cGAMP and consecutive activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) followed by production of type I interferon (IFN). Although cancer cells contain supra-normal concentrations of cytoplasmic DNA, they rarely produce type I IFN spontaneously. This suggests that defects in the DNA-sensing pathway may serve as an immune escape mechanism. We find that cancer cells produce cGAMP that is transferred via gap junctions to tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which respond by producing type I IFN in situ. Cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS, but not STING, promotes infiltration by effector CD8+ T cells and consequently results in prolonged survival. Furthermore, cGAS-expressing cancers respond better to genotoxic treatments and immunotherapy. Thus, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP is crucial to protective anti-tumor CD8+ T cell immunity. Consequently, cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS determines tumor immunogenicity and makes tumors hot. These findings are relevant for genotoxic and immune therapies for cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The deregulation of the actin cytoskeleton has been extensively studied in metastatic dissemination. However, the post-dissemination role of the actin cytoskeleton dysregulation is poorly understood. Here, we report that fascin, an actin-bundling protein, promotes lung cancer metastatic colonization by augmenting metabolic stress resistance and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Fascin is directly recruited to mitochondria under metabolic stress to stabilize mitochondrial actin filaments (mtF-actin). Using unbiased metabolomics and proteomics approaches, we discovered that fascin-mediated mtF-actin remodeling promotes mitochondrial OXPHOS by increasing the biogenesis of respiratory Complex I. Mechanistically, fascin and mtF-actin control the homeostasis of mtDNA to promote mitochondrial OXPHOS. The disruption of mtF-actin abrogates fascin-mediated lung cancer metastasis. Conversely, restoration of mitochondrial respiration by using yeast NDI1 in fascin-depleted cancer cells is able to rescue lung metastasis. Our findings indicate that the dysregulated actin cytoskeleton in metastatic lung cancer could be targeted to rewire mitochondrial metabolism and to prevent metastatic recurrence.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic hypermutation (SHM) introduces point mutations into immunoglobulin (Ig) genes but also causes mutations in other parts of the genome. We have used lentiviral SHM reporter vectors to identify regions of the genome that are susceptible (“hot”) and resistant (“cold”) to SHM, revealing that SHM susceptibility and resistance are often properties of entire topologically associated domains (TADs). Comparison of hot and cold TADs reveals that while levels of transcription are equivalent, hot TADs are enriched for the cohesin loader NIPBL, super-enhancers, markers of paused/stalled RNA polymerase 2, and multiple important B cell transcription factors. We demonstrate that at least some hot TADs contain enhancers that possess SHM targeting activity and that insertion of a strong Ig SHM-targeting element into a cold TAD renders it hot. Our findings lead to a model for SHM susceptibility involving the cooperative action of cis-acting SHM targeting elements and the dynamic and architectural properties of TADs.

Abstract: Summary
Proper transcriptome reprogramming is critical for hosts to launch an effective defense response upon pathogen attack. How immune-related genes are regulated at the posttranscriptional level remains elusive. We demonstrate here that P-bodies, the non-membranous cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein foci related to 5′-to-3′ mRNA decay, are dynamically modulated in plant immunity triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). The DCP1-DCP2 mRNA decapping complex, a hallmark of P-bodies, positively regulates plant MAMP-triggered responses and immunity against pathogenic bacteria. MAMP-activated MAP kinases directly phosphorylate DCP1 at the serine237 residue, which further stimulates its interaction with XRN4, an exonuclease executing 5′-to-3′ degradation of decapped mRNA. Consequently, MAMP treatment potentiates DCP1-dependent mRNA decay on a specific group of MAMP-downregulated genes. Thus, the conserved 5′-to-3′ mRNA decay elicited by the MAMP-activated MAP kinase cascade is an integral part of plant immunity. This mechanism ensures a rapid posttranscriptional downregulation of certain immune-related genes that may otherwise negatively impact immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The CRISPR effector Cas13 could be an effective antiviral for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses because it programmably cleaves RNAs complementary to its CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Here, we computationally identify thousands of potential Cas13 crRNA target sites in hundreds of ssRNA viral species that can potentially infect humans. We experimentally demonstrate Cas13’s potent activity against three distinct ssRNA viruses: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV); influenza A virus (IAV); and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Combining this antiviral activity with Cas13-based diagnostics, we develop Cas13-assisted restriction of viral expression and readout (CARVER), an end-to-end platform that uses Cas13 to detect and destroy viral RNA. We further screen hundreds of crRNAs along the LCMV genome to evaluate how conservation and target RNA nucleotide content influence Cas13’s antiviral activity. Our results demonstrate that Cas13 can be harnessed to target a wide range of ssRNA viruses and CARVER’s potential broad utility for rapid diagnostic and antiviral drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophages provide excellent tools for diagnostics, remediation, and targeted microbiome manipulation, yet isolating viruses with suitable host specificity remains challenging. Using Listeria phage PSA, we present a synthetic biology blueprint for host-range engineering through targeted modification of serovar-specific receptor binding proteins (RBPs). We identify Gp15 as the PSA RBP and construct a synthetic phage library featuring sequence-randomized RBPs, from which host range mutants are isolated and subsequently integrated into a synthetic, polyvalent phage with extended host range. To enable rational design of chimeric RBPs, we determine the crystal structure of the Gp15 receptor-binding carboxyl terminus at 1.7-Å resolution and employ bioinformatics to identify compatible, prophage-encoded RBPs targeting different Listeria serovars. Structure-guided design enables exchange of heterologous RBP head, neck, or shoulder domains to generate chimeric phages with predictable and extended host ranges. These strategies will facilitate the development of phage biologics based on standardized virus scaffolds with tunable host specificities.

Abstract: Summary
Break-induced replication (BIR) is a pathway of homology-directed repair that repairs one-ended DNA breaks, such as those formed at broken replication forks or uncapped telomeres. In contrast to conventional S phase DNA synthesis, BIR proceeds by a migrating D-loop and results in conservative synthesis of the nascent strands. DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) initiates BIR; however, it is not known whether synthesis of the invading strand switches to a different polymerase or how the complementary strand is synthesized. By using alleles of the replicative DNA polymerases that are permissive for ribonucleotide incorporation, thus generating a signature of their action in the genome that can be identified by hydrolytic end sequencing, we show that Pol δ replicates both the invading and the complementary strand during BIR. In support of this conclusion, we show that depletion of Pol δ from cells reduces BIR, whereas depletion of Pol ε has no effect.

Abstract: Summary
Consistent daylight oscillations and abundant oxygen availability are fundamental to human health. Here, we investigate the intersection between light-sensing (Period 2 [PER2]) and oxygen-sensing (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF1A]) pathways in cellular adaptation to myocardial ischemia. We demonstrate that intense light is cardioprotective via circadian PER2 amplitude enhancement, mimicking hypoxia-elicited adenosine- and HIF1A-metabolic adaptation to myocardial ischemia under normoxic conditions. Whole-genome array from intense light-exposed wild-type or Per2−/− mice and myocardial ischemia in endothelial-specific PER2-deficient mice uncover a critical role for intense light in maintaining endothelial barrier function via light-enhanced HIF1A transcription. A proteomics screen in human endothelia reveals a dominant role for PER2 in metabolic reprogramming to hypoxia via mitochondrial translocation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme activity regulation, and HIF1A transcriptional adaption to hypoxia. Translational investigation of intense light in human subjects identifies similar PER2 mechanisms, implicating the use of intense light for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of mammalian RNA interference components, particularly, Argonaute proteins, on chromatin organization is unexplored. Recent reports indicate that AGO1 association with chromatin appears to influence gene expression. To uncover the role of AGO1 in the nucleus, we used a combination of genome-wide approaches in control and AGO1-depleted HepG2 cells. We found that AGO1 strongly associates with active enhancers and RNA being produced at those sites. Hi-C analysis revealed AGO1 enrichment at the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs). By Hi-C in AGO1 knockdown cells, we observed changes in chromatin organization, including TADs and A/B compartment mixing, specifically in AGO1-bound regions. Distinct groups of genes and especially eRNA transcripts located within differentially interacting loci showed altered expression upon AGO1 depletion. Moreover, AGO1 association with enhancers is dependent on eRNA transcription. Collectively, our data suggest that enhancer-associated AGO1 contributes to the fine-tuning of chromatin architecture and gene expression in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
The metastatic process of colorectal cancer (CRC) is not fully understood and effective therapies are lacking. We show that activation of NOTCH1 signaling in the murine intestinal epithelium leads to highly penetrant metastasis (100% metastasis; with >80% liver metastases) in KrasG12D-driven serrated cancer. Transcriptional profiling reveals that epithelial NOTCH1 signaling creates a tumor microenvironment (TME) reminiscent of poorly prognostic human CRC subtypes (CMS4 and CRIS-B), and drives metastasis through transforming growth factor (TGF) β-dependent neutrophil recruitment. Importantly, inhibition of this recruitment with clinically relevant therapeutic agents blocks metastasis. We propose that NOTCH1 signaling is key to CRC progression and should be exploited clinically.

Abstract: Summary
Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) VP35 protein is a suppressor of type I interferon (IFN) production, an inhibitor of dendritic cell maturation, and a putative virulence determinant. Here, a recombinant EBOV encoding a mutant VP35 virus (VP35m) is demonstrated to activate RIG-I-like receptor signaling and innate antiviral pathways. When inoculated into cynomolgus macaques, VP35m exhibits dramatic attenuation as compared to wild-type EBOV (wtEBOV), with 20 or 300 times the standard 100% lethal challenge dose not causing EBOV disease (EVD). Further, VP35m infection, despite limited replication in vivo, activates antigen presentation and innate immunity pathways and elicits increased frequencies of proliferating memory T cells and B cells and production of anti-EBOV antibodies. Upon wtEBOV challenge, VP35m-immunized animals survive, exhibiting host responses consistent with an orderly immune response and the absence of excessive inflammation. These data demonstrate that VP35 is a critical EBOV immune evasion factor and provide insights into immune mechanisms of EBOV control.

Abstract: Summary
Chondrolectin (Chodl) is needed for motor axon extension in zebrafish and is dysregulated in mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, the mechanistic basis of Chodl function is not known. Here, we use Chodl-deficient zebrafish and mouse mutants to show that the absence of Chodl leads to anatomical and functional defects of the neuromuscular synapse. In zebrafish, the growth of an identified motor axon beyond an “en passant” synapse and later axon branching from synaptic points are impaired, leading to functional deficits. Mechanistically, motor-neuron-autonomous Chodl function depends on its intracellular domain and on binding muscle-derived collagen XIXa1 by its extracellular C-type lectin domain. Our data support evolutionarily conserved roles of Chodl in synaptogenesis and provide evidence for a “synapse-first” scenario of motor axon growth in zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proposed to be important for metastatic dissemination. However, recent studies have challenged the requirement of EMT for metastasis. Here, we assessed in different models of primary skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) whether EMT is associated with metastasis. The incidence of metastasis was much higher in SCCs presenting EMT compared to SCCs without EMT, supporting the notion that a certain degree of EMT is required to initiate the metastatic cascade in primary skin SCCs. Most circulating tumor cells presented EMT, whereas most lung metastasis did not present EMT, showing that mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is important for metastatic colonization. In contrast, immunodeficient mice transplanted with SCCs, whether displaying EMT or not, presented metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
The basic leucine zipper transcription factor activating transcription factor-like (Batf) contributes to transcriptional programming of multiple effector T cells and is required for T helper 17 (Th17) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell development. Here, we examine mechanisms by which Batf initiates gene transcription in developing effector CD4 T cells. We find that, in addition to its pioneering function, Batf controls developmentally regulated recruitment of the architectural factor Ctcf to promote chromatin looping that is associated with lineage-specific gene transcription. The chromatin-organizing actions of Batf are largely dependent on Ets1, which appears to be indispensable for the Batf-dependent recruitment of Ctcf. Moreover, most of the Batf-dependent sites to which Ctcf is recruited lie outside of activating protein-1-interferon regulatory factor (Ap-1-Irf) composite elements (AICEs), indicating that direct involvement of Batf-Irf complexes is not required. These results identify a cooperative role for Batf, Ets1, and Ctcf in chromatin reorganization that underpins the transcriptional programming of effector T cells.

Abstract: Summary
The striatum is organized into two major outputs formed by striatal projection neuron (SPN) subtypes with distinct molecular identities. In addition, histochemical division into patch and matrix compartments represents an additional spatial organization, proposed to mirror a motor-motivation regionalization. To map the molecular diversity of patch versus matrix SPNs, we genetically labeled mu opioid receptor (Oprm1) expressing neurons and performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing. This allowed us to establish molecular definitions of patch, matrix, and exopatch SPNs, as well as identification of Col11a1+ striatonigral SPNs. At the tissue level, mapping the expression of candidate markers reveals organization of spatial domains, which are conserved in the non-human primate brain. The spatial markers are cell-type independent and instead represent a spatial code found across all SPNs within a spatial domain. The spatiomolecular map establishes a formal system for targeting and studying striatal subregions and SPNs subtypes, beyond the classical striatonigral and striatopallidal division.

Abstract: Summary
Adolescence is a vulnerable period characterized by major cognitive changes. The mechanisms underlying the emergence of new cognitive functions are poorly understood. We find that a long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (iLTD) from parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the hippocampal area Cornu Ammonis 2 (CA2) is absent in young mice but emerges at the end of adolescence. We demonstrate that the maturation of both the perineuronal net (PNN) and signaling through ErbB4 is required for this plasticity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that social recognition memory displays the same age dependence as iLTD and is impaired by targeted degradation of the PNN or iLTD blockade in area CA2. Our data reveal an unusual developmental rule for plasticity at the PV+ interneuron transmission in area CA2 and indicate that this plasticity is involved in the emergence of higher cognitive function, such as social memory formation, in late adolescence.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulation of lactate in the tissue microenvironment is a feature of both inflammatory disease and cancer. Here, we assess the response of immune cells to lactate in the context of chronic inflammation. We report that lactate accumulation in the inflamed tissue contributes to the upregulation of the lactate transporter SLC5A12 by human CD4+ T cells. SLC5A12-mediated lactate uptake into CD4+ T cells induces a reshaping of their effector phenotype, resulting in increased IL17 production via nuclear PKM2/STAT3 and enhanced fatty acid synthesis. It also leads to CD4+ T cell retention in the inflamed tissue as a consequence of reduced glycolysis and enhanced fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, antibody-mediated blockade of SLC5A12 ameliorates the disease severity in a murine model of arthritis. Finally, we propose that lactate/SLC5A12-induced metabolic reprogramming is a distinctive feature of lymphoid synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis patients and a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
HNF4A is a nuclear hormone receptor that binds DNA as an obligate homodimer. While all known human heterozygous mutations are associated with the autosomal-dominant diabetes form MODY1, one particular mutation (p.R85W) in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) causes additional renal Fanconi syndrome (FRTS). Here, we find that expression of the conserved fly ortholog dHNF4 harboring the FRTS mutation in Drosophila nephrocytes caused nuclear depletion and cytosolic aggregation of a wild-type dHNF4 reporter protein. While the nuclear depletion led to mitochondrial defects and lipid droplet accumulation, the cytosolic aggregates triggered the expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), autophagy, and eventually cell death. The latter effects could be fully rescued by preventing nuclear export through interfering with serine phosphorylation in the DBD. Our data describe a genomic and a non-genomic mechanism for FRTS in HNF4A-associated MODY1 with important implications for the renal proximal tubule and the regulation of other nuclear hormone receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Bacillus spp. produce a wide range of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, which have been well studied for their antibacterial properties but less so as signaling molecules. Previous results indicated that the lipopeptide bacillomycin D is a signal that promotes biofilm development of Bacillus velezensis SQR9. However, the mechanism behind this signaling is still unknown. Here, we show that bacillomycin D promotes biofilm development by promoting the acquisition of iron. Bacillomycin D promotes the transcription of the iron ABC transporter FeuABC by binding to its transcription factor, Btr. These actions increase intracellular iron concentration and activate the KinB-Spo0A-SinI-SinR-dependent synthesis of biofilm matrix components. We demonstrate that this strategy is beneficial for biofilm development and competition with the Pseudomonas fluorescens PF-5. Our results unravel an antibiotic-dependent signaling mechanism that links iron acquisition to biofilm development and ecological competition.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian genomes are folded into topologically associating domains (TADs), consisting of chromatin loops anchored by CTCF and cohesin. Some loops are cell-type specific. Here we asked whether CTCF loops are established by a universal or locus-specific mechanism. Investigating the molecular determinants of CTCF clustering, we found that CTCF self-association in vitro is RNase sensitive and that an internal RNA-binding region (RBRi) mediates CTCF clustering and RNA interaction in vivo. Strikingly, deleting the RBRi impairs about half of all chromatin loops in mESCs and causes deregulation of gene expression. Disrupted loop formation correlates with diminished clustering and chromatin binding of RBRi mutant CTCF, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least two classes: RBRi-independent and RBRi-dependent loops. We speculate that evidence for RBRi-dependent loops may provide a molecular mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops, potentially regulated by RNA(s) or other RBRi-interacting partners.

Abstract: Summary
During autophagy, phagophores grow into double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show a critical role of Atg2A in phagophore expansion. Atg2A translocates to the phagophore at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) through a C-terminal 45-amino acid domain that we have termed the MAM localization domain (MLD). Proteomic analysis identifies the outer mitochondrial membrane protein TOM40 as a MLD-interacting partner. The Atg2A-TOM40 interaction is responsible for MAM localization of Atg2A and requires the TOM receptor protein TOM70. In addition, Atg2A interacts with Atg9A by a region within its N terminus. Inhibition of either Atg2A-TOM40 or Atg2A-Atg9A interactions impairs phagophore expansion and accumulates Atg9A-vesicles in the vicinity of autophagic structures. Collectively, we propose a model that the TOM70-TOM40 complex recruits Atg2A to the MAM for vesicular and/or non-vesicular lipid transport into the expanding phagophore to grow the size of autophagosomes for efficient autophagic flux.

SUMO-Chain-Regulated Proteasomal Degradation Timing Exemplified in DNA Replication Initiation,

Abstract: Summary
Similar to ubiquitin, SUMO forms chains, but the identity of SUMO-chain-modified factors and the purpose of this modification remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the budding yeast SUMO protease Ulp2, able to disassemble SUMO chains, as a DDK interactor enriched at replication origins that promotes DNA replication initiation. Replication-engaged DDK is SUMOylated on chromatin, becoming a degradation-prone substrate when Ulp2 no longer protects it against SUMO chain assembly. Specifically, SUMO chains channel DDK for SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase Slx5/Slx8-mediated and Cdc48 segregase-assisted proteasomal degradation. Importantly, the SUMOylation-defective ddk-KR mutant rescues inefficient replication onset and MCM activation in cells lacking Ulp2, suggesting that SUMO chains time DDK degradation. Using two unbiased proteomic approaches, we further identify subunits of the MCM helicase and other factors as SUMO-chain-modified degradation-prone substrates of Ulp2 and Slx5/Slx8. We thus propose SUMO-chain/Ulp2-protease-regulated proteasomal degradation as a mechanism that times the availability of functionally engaged SUMO-modified protein pools during replication and beyond.

Abstract: Summary
Tolerance to severe tumor microenvironments, including hypoxia and nutrient starvation, is a common feature of aggressive cancer cells and can be targeted. However, metabolic alterations that support cancer cells upon nutrient starvation are not well understood. Here, by comprehensive metabolome analyses, we show that glutamine deprivation leads to phosphoethanolamine (PEtn) accumulation in cancer cells via the downregulation of PEtn cytidylyltransferase (PCYT2), a rate-limiting enzyme of phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. PEtn accumulation correlated with tumor growth under nutrient starvation. PCYT2 suppression was partially mediated by downregulation of the transcription factor ELF3. Furthermore, PCYT2 overexpression reduced PEtn levels and tumor growth. In addition, PEtn accumulation and PCYT2 downregulation in human breast tumors correlated with poor prognosis. Thus, we show that glutamine deprivation leads to tumor progression by regulating PE biosynthesis via the ELF3-PCYT2 axis. Furthermore, manipulating glutamine-responsive genes could be a therapeutic approach to limit cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue folding is a fundamental process that shapes epithelia into complex 3D organs. The initial positioning of folds is the foundation for the emergence of correct tissue morphology. Mechanisms forming individual folds have been studied, but the precise positioning of folds in complex, multi-folded epithelia is less well-understood. We present a computational model of morphogenesis, encompassing local differential growth and tissue mechanics, to investigate tissue fold positioning. We use the Drosophila wing disc as our model system and show that there is spatial-temporal heterogeneity in its planar growth rates. This differential growth, especially at the early stages of development, is the main driver for fold positioning. Increased apical layer stiffness and confinement by the basement membrane drive fold formation but influence positioning to a lesser degree. The model successfully predicts the in vivo morphology of overgrowth clones and wingless mutants via perturbations solely on planar differential growth in silico.

Abstract: Summary
In the secretory pathway, budding of vesicular transport carriers from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) must coordinate specification of lipid composition with selection of secreted proteins. We elucidate a mechanism of soluble protein cargo sorting into secretory vesicles with a sphingomyelin-rich membrane; the integral membrane proteoglycan Syndecan-1 (SDC1) acts as a sorting receptor, capturing the soluble enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) during export from the TGN. Sorting of LPL requires bivalent interactions between LPL and SDC1-linked heparan sulfate chains and between LPL and the Golgi membrane. Physical features of the SDC1 transmembrane domain, rather than a specific sequence, confer targeting of SDC1 and bound LPL into the sphingomyelin secretion pathway. This study establishes that physicochemical properties of a protein transmembrane domain that drive lateral heterogeneity of the plasma membrane also operate at the TGN to confer sorting of an integral membrane protein and its ligand within the biosynthetic secretory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
P granules are perinuclear condensates in C. elegans germ cells proposed to serve as hubs for self/non-self RNA discrimination by Argonautes. We report that a mutant (meg-3 meg-4) that does not assemble P granules in primordial germ cells loses competence for RNA-interference over several generations and accumulates silencing small RNAs against hundreds of endogenous genes, including the RNA-interference genes rde-11 and sid-1. In wild type, rde-11 and sid-1 transcripts are heavily targeted by piRNAs and accumulate in P granules but maintain expression. In the primordial germ cells of meg-3 meg-4 mutants, rde-11 and sid-1 transcripts disperse in the cytoplasm with the small RNA biogenesis machinery, become hyper-targeted by secondary sRNAs, and are eventually silenced. Silencing requires the PIWI-class Argonaute PRG-1 and the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1 that maintains trans-generational silencing of piRNA targets. These observations support a “safe harbor” model for P granules in protecting germline transcripts from piRNA-initiated silencing.

Abstract: Summary
This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the Hoch et al. (2019) Matters Arising paper published concurrently in this issue of Cell Reports. The genetic study in humans revealed a strong association of DNA variants in the SLC16A11 coding region with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, how these T2D variants affect the function of SLC16A11 remains controversial. In Zhao et al. (2019), with studies using genetic knockout mouse models and in vivo gene reconstitution experiments, we demonstrated gain of aberrant functions of mutant SLC16A11-carrying T2D variants, which cause liver steatosis and insulin resistance. Hoch et al. (2019) raise concerns regarding the animal models and experimental settings used in the study. Here, we address their concerns and emphasize that discoveries from the physiological studies of SLC16A11 by using mouse models disagree with the previous proposal by Rusu et al. (2017) that “therapeutics that enhance SLC16A11 levels or activity may be beneficial for T2D.”

Abstract: Summary
Notwithstanding the positive clinical impact of endocrine therapies in estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer, de novo and acquired resistance limits the therapeutic lifespan of existing drugs. Taking the position that resistance is nearly inevitable, we undertook a study to identify and exploit targetable vulnerabilities that were manifest in endocrine therapy-resistant disease. Using cellular and mouse models of endocrine therapy-sensitive and endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer, together with contemporary discovery platforms, we identified a targetable pathway that is composed of the transcription factors FOXA1 and GRHL2, a coregulated target gene, the membrane receptor LYPD3, and the LYPD3 ligand, AGR2. Inhibition of the activity of this pathway using blocking antibodies directed against LYPD3 or AGR2 inhibits the growth of endocrine therapy-resistant tumors in mice, providing the rationale for near-term clinical development of humanized antibodies directed against these proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) are mostly quiescent, and only a few are in cell cycle at any point in time. DG NSCs become increasingly dormant with age and enter mitosis less frequently, which impinges on neurogenesis. How NSC inactivity is maintained is largely unknown. Here, we found that Id4 is a downstream target of Notch2 signaling and maintains DG NSC quiescence by blocking cell-cycle entry. Id4 expression is sufficient to promote DG NSC quiescence and Id4 knockdown rescues Notch2-induced inhibition of NSC proliferation. Id4 deletion activates NSC proliferation in the DG without evoking neuron generation, and overexpression increases NSC maintenance while promoting astrogliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis. Together, our findings indicate that Id4 is a major effector of Notch2 signaling in NSCs and a Notch2-Id4 axis promotes NSC quiescence in the adult DG, uncoupling NSC activation from neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 hijacks host proteins to promote infection. Here we show that HIV is also dependent upon the host metabolite inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) for viral production and primary cell replication. HIV-1 recruits IP6 into virions using two lysine rings in its immature hexamers. Mutation of either ring inhibits IP6 packaging and reduces viral production. Loss of IP6 also results in virions with highly unstable capsids, leading to a profound loss of reverse transcription and cell infection. Replacement of one ring with a hydrophobic isoleucine core restores viral production, but IP6 incorporation and infection remain impaired, consistent with an independent role for IP6 in stable capsid assembly. Genetic knockout of biosynthetic kinases IPMK and IPPK reveals that cellular IP6 availability limits the production of diverse lentiviruses, but in the absence of IP6, HIV-1 packages IP5 without loss of infectivity. Together, these data suggest that IP6 is a critical cofactor for HIV-1 replication.

By physically evoking conformational switching of AMPK, HSF1 impairs AMP binding to the γ subunits and enhances the PP2A-mediated de-phosphorylation, but it impedes the LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Thr172, and retards ATP binding to the catalytic α subunits. These immediate and manifold regulations empower HSF1 to both repress AMPK under basal conditions and restrain its activation by diverse stimuli, thereby promoting lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and protein cholesteroylation. In vivo, HSF1 antagonizes AMPK to control body fat mass and drive the lipogenic phenotype and growth of melanomas independently of its intrinsic transcriptional action. Thus, the physical AMPK-HSF1 interaction epitomizes a reciprocal kinase-substrate regulation whereby lipid metabolism and proteomic stability intertwine.

Abstract: Summary
Uterine fibroids are benign myometrial smooth muscle tumors of unknown etiology that, when symptomatic, are the most common indication for hysterectomy in the United States. Unsupervised clustering of results from DNA methylation analyses segregates normal myometrium from fibroids and further segregates the fibroids into subtypes characterized by MED12 mutation or activation of either HMGA2 or HMGA1 expression. Upregulation of HMGA2 expression does not always appear to be dependent on translocation but is associated with hypomethylation in the HMGA2 gene body. HOXA13 expression is upregulated in fibroids and correlates with expression of typical uterine fibroid genes. Significant overlap of differentially expressed genes is observed between cervical stroma and uterine fibroids compared with normal myometrium. These analyses show a possible role of DNA methylation in fibroid biology and suggest that homeotic transformation of myometrial cells to a more cervical stroma phenotype could be an important mechanism for etiology of the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) must access chromatin to bind to their response elements and regulate gene expression. A widely accepted model proposes that only a special subset of TFs, pioneer factors, can associate with condensed chromatin and initiate chromatin opening. We previously reported that steroid receptors (SRs), not considered pioneer factors, can assist the binding of an archetypal pioneer, the forkhead box protein 1 (FOXA1), at a subset of receptor-activated enhancers. These findings have been challenged recently, with the suggestion that newly acquired data fully support the prevailing pioneer model. Here, we reexamine our results and confirm the original conclusions. We also analyze and discuss a number of available datasets relevant to chromatin penetration by SRs and find a general consensus supporting our original observations. Hence, we propose that chromatin opening at some sites can be initiated by SRs, with a parallel recruitment of factors often treated as having a unique pioneer function. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Glont et al. (2019), published in Cell Reports.

Abstract: Summary
Comprehensive sequencing approaches have allowed for the identification of the most frequent contributors to cancer, known as drivers. They have also revealed a class of mutations in understudied, infrequently altered genes, referred to as “long tail” (LT) drivers. A key challenge has been to find clinically relevant LT drivers and to understand how they cooperate to drive disease. Here, we identified far upstream binding protein 1 (FUBP1) as an LT driver using an in vivo CRISPR screen. FUBP1 cooperates with other tumor suppressor genes to transform mammary epithelial cells by disrupting cellular differentiation and tissue architecture. Mechanistically, FUBP1 participates in regulating N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, and its loss leads to global changes in RNA splicing and widespread expression of aberrant driver isoforms. These findings suggest that somatic alteration of a single gene involved in RNA splicing and m6A methylation can produce the necessary panoply of contributors for neoplastic transformation.

Abstract: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a popular tool to identify underlying biological processes in clinical samples using their gene expression phenotypes. GSEA measures the enrichment of annotated gene sets that represent biological processes for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in clinical samples. GSEA may be suboptimal for functional gene sets; however, because DEGs from the expression dataset may not be functional genes per se but dysregulated genes perturbed by bona fide functional genes. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed network-based GSEA (NGSEA), which measures the enrichment score of functional gene sets using the expression difference of not only individual genes but also their neighbors in the functional network. We found that NGSEA outperformed GSEA in identifying pathway gene sets for matched gene expression phenotypes. We also observed that NGSEA substantially improved the ability to retrieve known anti-cancer drugs from patient-derived gene expression data using drug-target gene sets compared with another method, Connectivity Map. We also repurposed FDA-approved drugs using NGSEA and experimentally validated budesonide as a chemical with anti-cancer effects for colorectal cancer. We, therefore, expect that NGSEA will facilitate both pathway interpretation of gene expression phenotypes and anti-cancer drug repositioning. NGSEA is freely available at www.inetbio.org/ngsea.

Abstract: Summary
Appropriate regulation of genes that coordinate pancreas progenitor proliferation and differentiation is required for pancreas development. Here, we explore the role of H3K4 methylation and the Trithorax group (TrxG) complexes in mediating gene expression during pancreas development. Disruption of TrxG complex assembly, but not catalytic activity, prevented endocrine cell differentiation in pancreas progenitor spheroids. In vivo loss of TrxG catalytic activity in PDX1+ cells increased apoptosis and the fraction of progenitors in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Pancreas progenitors were reallocated to the acinar lineage, primarily at the expense of NEUROG3+ endocrine progenitors. Later in development, acinar and endocrine cell numbers were decreased, and increased gene expression variance and reduced terminal marker activation in acinar cells led to their incomplete differentiation. These findings demonstrate that TrxG co-activator activity is required for gene induction, whereas TrxG catalytic activity and H3K4 methylation help maintain transcriptional stability.

Abstract: Summary
Current statistical models for assessing hotspot significance do not properly account for variation in site-specific mutability, thereby yielding many false-positives. We thus (i) detail a Log-normal-Poisson (LNP) background model that accounts for this variability in a manner consistent with models of mutagenesis; (ii) use it to show that passenger hotspots arise from all common mutational processes; and (iii) apply it to a ∼10,000-patient cohort to nominate driver hotspots with far fewer false-positives compared with conventional methods. Overall, we show that many cancer hotspot mutations recurring at the same genomic site across multiple tumors are actually passenger events, recurring at inherently mutable genomic sites under no positive selection.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is composed of EED, SUZ12, and EZH1/2 and mediates mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. At least two independent subcomplexes exist, defined by their specific accessory proteins: PRC2.1 (PCL1–3, EPOP, and PALI1/2) and PRC2.2 (AEBP2 and JARID2). We show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 share the majority of target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. The loss of PCL1–3 is sufficient to evict PRC2.1 from Polycomb target genes but only leads to a partial reduction of PRC2.2 and H3K27me3. Conversely, disruption of PRC2.2 function through the loss of either JARID2 or RING1A/B is insufficient to completely disrupt targeting of SUZ12 by PCLs. Instead, the combined loss of both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 is required, leading to the global mislocalization of SUZ12. This supports a model in which the specific accessory proteins within PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate to direct H3K27me3 via both synergistic and independent mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Rad52 is a key factor for homologous recombination (HR) in yeast. Rad52 helps assemble Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments that catalyze DNA strand exchange, and it mediates single-strand DNA annealing. We find that Rad52 has an even earlier function in HR in restricting DNA double-stranded break ends resection that generates 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. In fission yeast, Exo1 is the primary resection nuclease, with the helicase Rqh1 playing a minor role. We demonstrate that the choice of two extensive resection pathways is regulated by Rad52. In rad52 cells, the resection rate increases from ∼3–5 kb/h up to ∼10–20 kb/h in an Rqh1-dependent manner, while Exo1 becomes dispensable. Budding yeast Rad52 similarly inhibits Sgs1-dependent resection. Single-molecule analysis with purified budding yeast proteins shows that Rad52 competes with Sgs1 for DNA end binding and inhibits Sgs1 translocation along DNA. These results identify a role for Rad52 in limiting ssDNA generated by end resection.

Abstract: Summary
The transition of neural progenitors to differentiated postmitotic neurons is mainly considered irreversible in physiological conditions. In the present work, we show that Shh pathway activation through SmoM2 expression promotes postmitotic neurons dedifferentiation, re-entering in the cell cycle and originating medulloblastoma in vivo. Notably, human adult patients present inactivating mutations of the chromatin reader BRPF1 that are associated with SMO mutations and absent in pediatric and adolescent patients. Here, we found that truncated BRPF1 protein, as found in human adult patients, is able to induce medulloblastoma in adult mice upon SmoM2 activation. Indeed, postmitotic neurons re-entered the cell cycle and proliferated as a result of chromatin remodeling of neurons by BRPF1. Our model of brain cancer explains the onset of a subset of human medulloblastoma in adult individuals where granule neuron progenitors are no longer present.

Abstract: Summary
Employing inducible genetically engineered and orthotopic mouse models, we demonstrate a key role for transcriptional regulator Yap in maintenance of Kras-mutant pancreatic tumors. Integrated transcriptional and metabolomics analysis reveals that Yap transcribes Myc and cooperates with Myc to maintain global transcription of metabolic genes. Yap loss triggers acute metabolic stress, which causes tumor regression while inducing epigenetic reprogramming and Sox2 upregulation in a subset of pancreatic neoplastic cells. Sox2 restores Myc expression and metabolic homeostasis in Yap-deficient neoplastic ductal cells, which gradually re-differentiate into acinar-like cells, partially restoring pancreatic parenchyma in vivo. Both the short-term and long-term effects of Yap loss in inducing cell death and re-differentiation, respectively, are blunted in advanced, poorly differentiated p53-mutant pancreatic tumors. Collectively, these findings reveal a highly dynamic and interdependent metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic regulatory network governed by Yap, Myc, Sox2, and p53 that dictates pancreatic tumor metabolism, growth, survival, and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient starvation and inactivation of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) protein kinase induce nucleophagy preferentially degrading only nucleolar components in budding yeast. Nucleolar proteins are relocated to sites proximal to the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ), where micronucleophagy occurs, whereas rDNA, which is embedded in the nucleolus under normal conditions, moves to NVJ-distal regions, causing rDNA dissociation from nucleolar proteins after TORC1 inactivation. This repositioning is mediated via chromosome linkage INM protein (CLIP)-cohibin complexes that tether rDNA to the inner nuclear membrane. Here, we show that TORC1 inactivation-induced rDNA condensation promotes the repositioning of rDNA and nucleolar proteins. Defects in condensin, Rpd3–Sin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC), and high-mobility group protein 1 (Hmo1), which are involved in TORC1 inactivation-induced rDNA condensation, compromised the repositioning and nucleophagic degradation of nucleolar proteins, although rDNA still escaped from nucleophagic degradation in these mutants. We propose a model in which rDNA condensation after TORC1 inactivation generates a motive force for the repositioning of rDNA and nucleolar proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Termination of DNA replication occurs when two replication forks converge upon the same stretch of DNA. Resolution of topological stress by topoisomerases is crucial for fork convergence in bacteria and viruses, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms operate during vertebrate termination. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that topoisomerase II (Top2) resolves topological stress to prevent converging forks from stalling during termination. Under these conditions, stalling arises due to an inability to unwind the final stretch of DNA ahead of each fork. By promoting fork convergence, Top2 facilitates all downstream events of termination. Converging forks ultimately overcome stalling independently of Top2, indicating that additional mechanisms support fork convergence. Top2 acts throughout replication to prevent the accumulation of topological stress that would otherwise stall converging forks. Thus, termination poses evolutionarily conserved topological problems that can be mitigated by careful execution of the earlier stages of replication.

Abstract: Summary
While comorbid pain in depression (CP) occurs at a high rate worldwide, the neural connections underlying the core symptoms of CP have yet to be elucidated. Here, we define a pathway whereby GABAergic neurons from the central nucleus of the amygdala (GABACeA) project to glutamatergic neurons in the parafascicular nucleus (GluPF). These GluPF neurons relay directly to neurons in the second somatosensory cortex (S2), a well-known area involved in pain signal processing. Enhanced inhibition of the GABACeA→GluPF→S2 pathway is found in mice exhibiting CP symptoms. Reversing this pathway using chemogenetic or optogenetic approaches alleviates CP symptoms. Together, the current study demonstrates the putative importance of the GABACeA→GluPF→S2 pathway in controlling at least some aspects of CP.

Abstract: Summary
Alcohol produces both stimulant and sedative effects in humans and rodents. In humans, alcohol abuse disorder is associated with a higher stimulant and lower sedative responses to alcohol. Here, we show that this association is conserved in mice and demonstrate a causal link with another liability factor: low expression of striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). Using transgenic mouse lines, we find that the selective loss of D2Rs on striatal medium spiny neurons enhances sensitivity to ethanol stimulation and generates resilience to ethanol sedation. These mice also display higher preference and escalation of ethanol drinking, which continues despite adverse outcomes. We find that striatal D1R activation is required for ethanol stimulation and that this signaling is enhanced in mice with low striatal D2Rs. These data demonstrate a link between two vulnerability factors for alcohol abuse and offer evidence for a mechanism in which low striatal D2Rs trigger D1R hypersensitivity, ultimately leading to compulsive-like drinking.

Abstract: When endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions are perturbed, the ER induces several signaling pathways called unfolded protein response to reestablish ER homeostasis through three ER transmembrane proteins: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Although it is important to measure the activity of ATF6 that can indicate the status of the ER, no specific cell-based reporter assay is currently available. Here, we report a new cell-based method for monitoring ER stress based on the cleavage of ATF6α by sequential actions of proteases at the Golgi apparatus during ER stress. A new expressing vector was constructed by using fusion gene of GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD) and activation domain derived from herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (VP16AD) followed by a human ATF6α N-terminal deletion variant. During ER stress, the GAL4DBD-VP16AD(GV)-hATF6α deletion variant was cleaved to liberate active transcription activator encompassing GV-hATF6α fragment which could translocate into the nucleus. The translocated GV-hATF6α fragment strongly induced the expression of firefly luciferase in HeLa Luciferase Reporter cell line containing a stably integrated 5X GAL4 site-luciferase gene. The established double stable reporter cell line HLR-GV-hATF6α(333) represents an innovative tool to investigate regulated intramembrane proteolysis of ATF6α. It can substitute active pATF6(N) binding motif-based reporter cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic neurons are the largest class of inhibitory neocortical cells. We visualize brain-wide, monosynaptic inputs to PV neurons in mouse barrel cortex. We develop intersectional rabies virus tracing to specifically target GABAergic PV cells and exclude a small fraction of excitatory PV cells from our starter population. Local inputs are mainly from layer (L) IV and excitatory cells. A small number of inhibitory inputs originate from LI neurons, which connect to LII/III PV neurons. Long-range inputs originate mainly from other sensory cortices and the thalamus. In visual cortex, most transsynaptically labeled neurons are located in LIV, which contains a molecularly mixed population of projection neurons with putative functional similarity to LIII neurons. This study expands our knowledge of the brain-wide circuits in which PV neurons are embedded and introduces intersectional rabies virus tracing as an applicable tool to dissect the circuitry of more clearly defined cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate chromatin structure and dynamics during various DNA-associated processes. Here, we report that lysine glutarylation (Kglu) occurs at 27 lysine residues on human core histones. Using semi-synthetic glutarylated histones, we show that an evolutionarily conserved Kglu at histone H4K91 destabilizes nucleosome in vitro. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the replacement of H4K91 by glutamate that mimics Kglu influences chromatin structure and thereby results in a global upregulation of transcription and defects in cell-cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and telomere silencing. In mammalian cells, H4K91glu is mainly enriched at promoter regions of highly expressed genes. A downregulation of H4K91glu is tightly associated with chromatin condensation during mitosis and in response to DNA damage. The cellular dynamics of H4K91glu is controlled by Sirt7 as a deglutarylase and KAT2A as a glutaryltransferase. This study designates a new histone mark (Kglu) as a new regulatory mechanism for chromatin dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Collective cell migration is involved in various developmental and pathological processes, including the dissemination of various cancer cells. During Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis, a group of cells called border cells migrate collectively toward the oocyte. Herein, we show that members of the Arf family of small GTPases and some of their regulators are required for normal border cell migration. Notably, we found that the ArfGAP Drongo and its GTPase-activating function are essential for the initial detachment of the border cell cluster from the basal lamina. We demonstrate through protein localization and genetic interactions that Drongo controls the localization of the myosin phosphatase in order to regulate myosin II activity at the back of the cluster. Moreover, we show that toward the class III Arf, Drongo acts antagonistically to the guanine exchange factor Steppke. Overall, our work describes a mechanistic pathway that promotes the local actomyosin contractility necessary for border cell detachment.

Abstract: Summary
A wide variety of multicellular organisms across the kingdoms display remarkable ability to restore their tissues or organs when they suffer damage. However, the ability to repair damage is not uniformly distributed throughout body parts. Here, we unravel the elusive mechanistic basis of boundaries on organ regeneration potential using root tip resection as a model and show that the dosage of gradient-expressed PLT2 transcription factor is the underlying cause. While transient downregulation of PLT2 in distinct set of plt mutant backgrounds renders meristematic cells incapable of regeneration, forced expression of PLT2 acts through auto-activation to confer regeneration potential to the cells undergoing differentiation. Surprisingly, sustained exposure to nuclear PLT2, beyond a threshold, leads to reduction of regeneration potential despite giving rise to longer meristem. Our studies reveal dosage-dependent role of gradient-expressed PLT2 in root tip regeneration and uncouple the size of an organ from its regeneration potential.

Abstract: Summary
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is key to maintaining the transmembrane protein composition of cells’ limiting membranes. During mammalian CME, a reversible phosphorylation event occurs on Thr156 of the μ2 subunit of the main endocytic clathrin adaptor, AP2. We show that this phosphorylation event starts during clathrin-coated pit (CCP) initiation and increases throughout CCP lifetime. μ2Thr156 phosphorylation favors a new, cargo-bound conformation of AP2 and simultaneously creates a binding platform for the endocytic NECAP proteins but without significantly altering AP2’s cargo affinity in vitro. We describe the structural bases of both. NECAP arrival at CCPs parallels that of clathrin and increases with μ2Thr156 phosphorylation. In turn, NECAP recruits drivers of late stages of CCP formation, including SNX9, via a site distinct from where NECAP binds AP2. Disruption of the different modules of this phosphorylation-based temporal regulatory system results in CCP maturation being delayed and/or stalled, hence impairing global rates of CME.

Abstract: Summary
The two related members of the vasohibin family, VASH1 and VASH2, encode human tubulin detyrosinases. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to VASH1, which requires binding of small vasohibin binding protein (SVBP), VASH2 has autonomous tubulin detyrosinating activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that SVBP acts as a bona fide activator of both enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis of the vasohibin family revealed that regulatory diversification of VASH-mediated tubulin detyrosination coincided with early vertebrate evolution. Thus, as a model organism for functional analysis, we used Trypanosoma brucei (Tb), an evolutionarily early-branched eukaryote that possesses a single VASH and encodes a terminal tyrosine on both α- and β-tubulin tails, both subject to removal. Remarkably, although detyrosination levels are high in the flagellum, TbVASH knockout parasites did not present any noticeable flagellar abnormalities. In contrast, we observed reduced proliferation associated with profound morphological and mitotic defects, underscoring the importance of tubulin detyrosination in cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Turing patterns (TPs) underlie many fundamental developmental processes, but they operate over narrow parameter ranges, raising the conundrum of how evolution can ever discover them. Here we explore TP design space to address this question and to distill design rules. We exhaustively analyze 2- and 3-node biological candidate Turing systems, amounting to 7,625 networks and more than 3 × 1011 analyzed scenarios. We find that network structure alone neither implies nor guarantees emergent TPs. A large fraction (>61%) of network design space can produce TPs, but these are sensitive to even subtle changes in parameters, network structure, and regulatory mechanisms. This implies that TP networks are more common than previously thought, and evolution might regularly encounter prototypic solutions. We deduce compositional rules for TP systems that are almost necessary and sufficient (96% of TP networks contain them, and 92% of networks implementing them produce TPs). This comprehensive network atlas provides the blueprints for identifying natural TPs and for engineering synthetic systems.

Abstract: Summary
Early B cell development is regulated by stage-specific transcription factors. PU.1, an ETS-family transcription factor, is essential for coordination of early B cell maturation and immunoglobulin gene (Ig) rearrangement. Here we show that RAG DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated during Ig light chain gene (Igl) rearrangement in pre-B cells induce global changes in PU.1 chromatin binding. RAG DSBs activate a SPIC/BCLAF1 transcription factor complex that displaces PU.1 throughout the genome and regulates broad transcriptional changes. SPIC recruits BCLAF1 to gene-regulatory elements that control expression of key B cell developmental genes. The SPIC/BCLAF1 complex suppresses expression of the SYK tyrosine kinase and enforces the transition from large to small pre-B cells. These studies reveal that RAG DSBs direct genome-wide changes in ETS transcription factor activity to promote early B cell development.

Abstract: Summary
While autophagy is thought to be an essential process in some cancer cells, it is unknown if or how such cancer cells can circumvent autophagy inhibition. To address this, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9 assay with dynamic live-cell imaging to measure acute effects of knockout (KO) of autophagy genes compared to known essential and non-essential genes. In some cancer cells, autophagy is as essential for cancer cell growth as mRNA transcription or translation or DNA replication. However, even these highly autophagy-dependent cancer cells evolve to circumvent loss of autophagy by upregulating NRF2, which is necessary and sufficient for autophagy-dependent cells to circumvent ATG7 KO and maintain protein homeostasis. Importantly, however, this adaptation increases susceptibly to proteasome inhibitors. These studies identify a common mechanism of acquired resistance to autophagy inhibition and show that selection to avoid tumor cell dependency on autophagy creates new, potentially actionable cancer cell susceptibilities.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrillar centers (FCs) and dense fibrillar components (DFCs) are essential morphologically distinct sub-regions of mammalian cell nucleoli for rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA processing. Here, we report that a human nucleolus consists of several dozen FC/DFC units, each containing 2–3 transcriptionally active rDNAs at the FC/DFC border. Pre-rRNA processing factors, such as fibrillarin (FBL), form 18–24 clusters that further assemble into the DFC surrounding the FC. Mechanistically, the 5′ end of nascent 47S pre-rRNA binds co-transcriptionally to the RNA-binding domain of FBL. FBL diffuses to the DFC, where local self-association via its glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domain forms phase-separated clusters to immobilize FBL-interacting pre-rRNA, thus promoting directional traffic of nascent pre-rRNA while facilitating pre-rRNA processing and DFC formation. These results unveil FC/DFC ultrastructures in nucleoli and suggest a conceptual framework for considering nascent RNA sorting using multivalent interactions of their binding proteins.

Abstract: Summary
A key feature of brain plasticity is the experience-dependent selection of optimal connections, implemented by a set of activity-regulated genes that dynamically adjust synapse strength and number. The activity-regulated gene cpg15/neuritin has been previously implicated in stabilization and maturation of excitatory synapses. Here, we combine two-photon microscopy with genetic and sensory manipulations to dissect excitatory synapse formation in vivo and examine the role of activity and CPG15 in dendritic spine formation, PSD95 recruitment, and synapse stabilization. We find that neither visual experience nor CPG15 is required for spine formation. However, PSD95 recruitment to nascent spines and their subsequent stabilization requires both. Further, cell-autonomous CPG15 expression is sufficient to replace experience in facilitating PSD95 recruitment and spine stabilization. CPG15 directly interacts with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors on immature dendritic spines, suggesting a signaling mode for this small extracellular molecule acting as an experience-dependent “selector” for spine stabilization and synapse maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of MHC class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation in cancer cells can elicit immunotherapy resistance. A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identified an evolutionarily conserved function of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that mediates coordinated transcriptional silencing of the MHC-I antigen processing pathway (MHC-I APP), promoting evasion of T cell-mediated immunity. MHC-I APP gene promoters in MHC-I low cancers harbor bivalent activating H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone modifications, silencing basal MHC-I expression and restricting cytokine-induced upregulation. Bivalent chromatin at MHC-I APP genes is a normal developmental process active in embryonic stem cells and maintained during neural progenitor differentiation. This physiological MHC-I silencing highlights a conserved mechanism by which cancers arising from these primitive tissues exploit PRC2 activity to enable immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Mucociliary epithelia provide a first line of defense against pathogens. Impaired regeneration and remodeling of mucociliary epithelia are associated with dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in chronic airway diseases, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and studies yield seemingly contradicting results. Employing the Xenopus mucociliary epidermis, the mouse airway, and human airway Basal cells, we characterize the evolutionarily conserved roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vertebrates. In multiciliated cells, Wnt is required for cilia formation during differentiation. In Basal cells, Wnt prevents specification of epithelial cell types by activating ΔN-TP63, a master transcription factor, which is necessary and sufficient to mediate the Wnt-induced inhibition of specification and is required to retain Basal cells during development. Chronic Wnt activation leads to remodeling and Basal cell hyperplasia, which are reversible in vivo and in vitro, suggesting Wnt inhibition as a treatment option in chronic lung diseases. Our work provides important insights into mucociliary signaling, development, and disease.

Abstract: Summary
In higher vertebrates, cephalic neural crest cells (NCCs) form craniofacial skeleton by differentiating into chondrocytes and osteoblasts. A subpopulation of cephalic NCCs, cardiac NCCs (CNCCs), migrates to the heart. However, CNCCs mostly do not yield skeletogenic derivatives, and the molecular mechanisms of this fate restriction remain elusive. We identify a disintegrin and metalloprotease 19 (Adam19) as a position-specific fate regulator of NCCs. Adam19-depleted mice abnormally form NCC-derived cartilage in their hearts through the upregulation of Sox9 levels in CNCCs. Moreover, NCC-lineage-specific Sox9-overexpressing mice recapitulate CNCC chondrogenesis. In vitro experiments show that Adam19 mediates the cleavage of bone morphogenic protein (BMP) type I receptor Alk2 (Acvr1), whereas pharmacogenetic approaches reveal that Adam19 inhibits CNCC chondrogenesis by suppressing the BMP-Sox9 cascade, presumably through processing Alk2. These findings suggest a metalloprotease-dependent mechanism attenuating cellular responsiveness to BMP ligands, which is essential for both the positional restriction of NCC skeletogenesis and normal heart development.

Abstract: Summary
Exon junction complex (EJC) assembles after splicing at specific positions upstream of exon-exon junctions in mRNAs of all higher eukaryotes, affecting major regulatory events. In mammalian cell cytoplasm, EJC is essential for efficient RNA surveillance, while in Drosophila, EJC is essential for localization of oskar mRNA. Here we developed a method for isolation of protein complexes and associated RNA targets (ipaRt) to explore the EJC RNA-binding landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner in adult Drosophila. We find the EJC at canonical positions, preferably on mRNAs from genes comprising multiple splice sites and long introns. Moreover, EJC occupancy is highest at junctions adjacent to strong splice sites, CG-rich hexamers, and RNA structures. Highly occupied mRNAs tend to be maternally localized and derive from genes involved in differentiation or development. These modalities, which have not been reported in mammals, specify EJC assembly on a biologically coherent set of transcripts in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres provide a robust model for epigenetic inheritance as they are specified by sequence-independent mechanisms involving the histone H3-variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). Prevailing models indicate that the high intrinsic stability of CENP-A nucleosomes maintains centromere identity indefinitely. Here, we demonstrate that CENP-A is not stable at centromeres but is instead gradually and continuously incorporated in quiescent cells including G0-arrested tissue culture cells and prophase I-arrested oocytes. Quiescent CENP-A incorporation involves the canonical CENP-A deposition machinery but displays distinct requirements from cell cycle-dependent deposition. We demonstrate that Plk1 is required specifically for G1 CENP-A deposition, whereas transcription promotes CENP-A incorporation in quiescent oocytes. Preventing CENP-A deposition during quiescence results in significantly reduced CENP-A levels and perturbs chromosome segregation following the resumption of cell division. In contrast to quiescent cells, terminally differentiated cells fail to maintain CENP-A levels. Our work reveals that quiescent cells actively maintain centromere identity providing an indicator of proliferative potential.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in transcriptional regulation through cis-regulatory elements are thought to drive brain evolution. However, how this impacts the identity of primate cortical neurons is still unresolved. Here, we show that primate-specific cis-regulatory sequences upstream of the Dbx1 gene promote human-like expression in the mouse embryonic cerebral cortex, and this imparts cell identity. Indeed, while Dbx1 is expressed in highly restricted cortical progenitors in the mouse ventral pallium, it is maintained in neurons in primates. Phenocopy of the primate-like Dbx1 expression in mouse cortical progenitors induces ectopic Cajal-Retzius and subplate (SP) neurons, which are transient populations playing crucial roles in cortical development. A conditional expression solely in neurons uncouples mitotic and postmitotic activities of Dbx1 and exclusively promotes a SP-like fate. Our results highlight how transcriptional changes of a single fate determinant in postmitotic cells may contribute to the expansion of neuronal diversity during cortical evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) contribute to vital cellular processes including cell cycle regulation. Loss of CDKs is associated with impaired insulin secretion and β cell survival; however, the function of CDK8 in β cells remains elusive. Here, we report that genetic ablation of Cdk8 improves glucose tolerance by increasing insulin secretion. We identify OSBPL3 as a CDK8-dependent phosphoprotein, which acts as a negative regulator of insulin secretion in response to glucose. We also show that embryonic gene silencing of neuropeptide Y in β cells is compromised in Cdk8-null mice, leading to continued expression into adulthood. Cdk8 ablation in β cells aggravates apoptosis and induces de novo expression of neuropeptides upon oxidative stress. Moreover, pancreatic islets exposed to stress display augmented apoptosis in the presence of these same neuropeptides. Our results reveal critical roles for CDK8 in β cell function and survival during metabolic stress that are in part mediated through de novo expression of neuropeptides.

Abstract: Summary
The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is crucial in interbacterial competition and is a virulence determinant of many Gram-negative bacteria. Several T6SS effectors are covalently fused to secreted T6SS structural components such as the VgrG spike for delivery into target cells. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the VgrG2b effector was previously proposed to mediate bacterial internalization into eukaryotic cells. In this work, we find that the VgrG2b C-terminal domain (VgrG2bC-ter) elicits toxicity in the bacterial periplasm, counteracted by a cognate immunity protein. We resolve the structure of VgrG2bC-ter and confirm it is a member of the zinc-metallopeptidase family of enzymes. We show that this effector causes membrane blebbing at midcell, which suggests a distinct type of T6SS-mediated growth inhibition through interference with cell division, mimicking the impact of β-lactam antibiotics. Our study introduces a further effector family to the T6SS arsenal and demonstrates that VgrG2b can target both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

Cold exposure has been reported to affect atherosclerosis through regulation of adipose function, but the mechanism has not been well clarified. Here, adipocyte hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) was upregulated after mild cold exposure at 16°C and mediated cold-induced thermogenesis. Adipocyte HIF-2α deficiency exacerbated Western-diet-induced atherosclerosis by increasing adipose ceramide levels, which blunted hepatocyte cholesterol elimination and thermogenesis. Mechanistically, Acer2, the gene encoding alkaline ceramidase 2, was identified as a novel target gene of HIF-2α, triggering ceramide catabolism. Adipose overexpression of ACER2 rescued adipocyte HIF-2α-deficiency-induced exacerbation of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, activation of adipose HIF-2α by the HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor FG-4592 had protective effects on atherosclerosis, accompanied by a reduction in adipose and plasma ceramide and plasma cholesterol levels. This study highlights adipocyte HIF-2α as a putative drug target against atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoiesis is particularly sensitive to DNA damage. Myeloid tumor incidence increases in patients with DNA repair defects and after chemotherapy. It is not known why hematopoietic cells are highly vulnerable to DNA damage. Addressing this question is complicated by the paucity of mouse models of hematopoietic malignancies due to defective DNA repair. We show that DNA repair-deficient Mcm8- and Mcm9-knockout mice develop myeloid tumors, phenocopying prevalent myelodysplastic syndromes. We demonstrate that these tumors are preceded by a lifelong DNA damage burden in bone marrow and that they acquire proliferative capacity by suppressing signaling of the tumor suppressor and cell cycle controller RB, as often seen in patients. Finally, we found that absence of MCM9 and the tumor suppressor Tp53 switches tumorigenesis to lymphoid tumors without precedent myeloid malignancy. Our results demonstrate that MCM8/9 deficiency drives myeloid tumor development and establishes a DNA damage burdened mouse model for hematopoietic malignancies.

Abstract: Abstarct
Background and aim
Improvement of gut microbiota may help in preventing the progression of cirrhosis. We supposed that Lactobacillus Plantarum (L. Plantarum) protects the cirrhotic liver through suppression of TLR4/ CXCL9/ PREX-2.
Methodology
Rats were divided into two groups. Group I, lasts for six weeks and Group II lasts for 12 weeks. Each group was subdivided into: naïve, Lactobacillus Plantarum (L. Plantarum), thioacetamide (TAA) and TAA + L. Plantarum. Liver function tests, α fetoprotein (AFP) levels, CXCL9, PREX-2 and TLR4 expression were assessed. Histological studies were performed.
Results
TAA induced significant deterioration in liver functions and increased AFP. There was periportal cirrhosis, vacuolated hepatocytes, decrease hepatocyte parrafin-1 (hep par-1) expression, increase proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive nuclei and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. The PCR results showed significant increase in TLR4, CXCL9 and PREX-2 expression. Early administration of L. Plantarum significantly decreased the expression of TLR4, CXCL9 and PREX-2 together with improvement in liver function and prevented the pathological changes.
Conclusions
The cirrhotic complications induced by TAA are through activation of TLR4/ CXCL9/ PREX-2 pathway and could be prevented by the early administration of L. Plantarum.

Abstract: Summary
The extracellular molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (eHSP90) stabilizes protease client the matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), leading to tumor cell invasion. Although co-chaperones are critical modulators of intracellular HSP90:client function, how the eHSP90:MMP2 complex is regulated remains speculative. Here, we report that the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) is a stress-inducible extracellular co-chaperone that binds to eHSP90, increases eHSP90 binding to ATP, and inhibits its ATPase activity. In addition to disrupting the eHSP90:MMP2 complex and terminally inactivating MMP2, TIMP2 loads the client to eHSP90, keeping the protease in a transient inhibitory state. Secreted activating co-chaperone AHA1 displaces TIMP2 from the complex, providing a “reactivating” mechanism for MMP2. Gene knockout or blocking antibodies targeting TIMP2 and AHA1 released by HT1080 cancer cells modify their gelatinolytic activity. Our data suggest that TIMP2 and AHA1 co-chaperones function as a molecular switch that determines the inhibition and reactivation of the eHSP90 client protein MMP2.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies targeting the receptor binding site (RBS) of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein are usually not broadly reactive because their footprints are typically large and extend to nearby variable HA residues. Here, we identify several human H3N2 HA RBS-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are sensitive to substitutions in conventional antigenic sites and are therefore not broadly reactive. However, we also identify an H3N2 HA RBS-targeting mAb that is exceptionally broadly reactive despite being sensitive to substitutions in residues outside of the RBS. We show that similar antibodies are present at measurable levels in the sera of some individuals but that they are inefficiently elicited by conventional vaccines. Our data indicate that HA RBS-targeting antibodies can be effective against variable viral strains even when they are somewhat sensitive to substitutions in HA residues adjacent to the RBS.

Abstract: Summary
Mild reduction in food intake was recently shown to slow polycystic kidney disease (PKD) progression in mouse models, but whether the effect was due to solely reduced calories or some other aspect of the diet has been unclear. We now show that the benefit is due to the induction of ketosis. Time-restricted feeding, without caloric reduction, strongly inhibits mTOR signaling, proliferation, and fibrosis in the affected kidneys in a PKD rat model. A ketogenic diet had a similar effect and led to regression of renal cystic burden. Acute fasting in rat, mouse, and feline models of PKD results in rapid reduction of cyst volume, while oral administration of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in rats strongly inhibits PKD progression. These results suggest that cystic cells in PKD are metabolically inflexible, which could be exploited by dietary interventions or supplementation with BHB, representing a new therapeutic avenue to treat PKD.

Abstract: Summary
Cells dynamically adjust organelle organization in response to growth and environmental cues. This requires regulation of synthesis of phospholipids, the building blocks of organelle membranes, or remodeling of their fatty-acyl (FA) composition. FAs are also the main components of triacyglycerols (TGs), which enable energy storage in lipid droplets. How cells coordinate FA metabolism with organelle biogenesis during cell growth remains unclear. Here, we show that Lro1, an acyltransferase that generates TGs from phospholipid-derived FAs in yeast, relocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to a subdomain of the inner nuclear membrane. Lro1 nuclear targeting is regulated by cell cycle and nutrient starvation signals and is inhibited when the nucleus expands. Lro1 is active at this nuclear subdomain, and its compartmentalization is critical for nuclear integrity. These data suggest that Lro1 nuclear targeting provides a site of TG synthesis, which is coupled with nuclear membrane remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Remyelination requires the generation of new oligodendrocytes (OLs), which are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Maturation of OPCs into OLs is a multi-step process. Here, we describe a microRNA expressed by OLs, miR-27a, as a regulator of OL development and survival. Increased levels of miR-27a were found in OPCs associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and in animal models of demyelination. Increased levels of miR-27a led to inhibition of OPC proliferation by cell-cycle arrest, as well as impaired differentiation of human OPCs (hOPCs) and myelination by dysregulating the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway. In vivo administration of miR-27a led to suppression of myelinogenic signals, leading to loss of endogenous myelination and remyelination. Our findings provide evidence supporting a critical role for a steady-state level of OL-specific miR-27a in supporting multiple steps in the complex process of OPC maturation and remyelination.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage tolerance plays a key role in protecting cell viability through translesion synthesis and template switching-mediated bypass of genotoxic polymerase-blocking base lesions. Both tolerance pathways critically rely on ubiquitylation of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) on lysine 164 and have been proposed to operate uncoupled from replication. We report that Ubp10 and Ubp12 ubiquitin proteases differentially cooperate in PCNA deubiquitylation, owing to distinct activities on PCNA-linked ubiquitin chains. Ubp10 and Ubp12 associate with replication forks in a fashion determined by Ubp10 dependency on lagging-strand PCNA residence, and they downregulate translesion polymerase recruitment and template switch events engaging nascent strands. These findings reveal PCNAK164 deubiquitylation as a key mechanism for the modulation of lesion bypass during replication, which might set a framework for establishing strand-differential pathway choices. We propose that damage tolerance is tempered at replication forks to limit the extension of bypass events and sustain chromosome replication rates.

Abstract: Summary
Rehabilitation is considered the most effective treatment for promoting the recovery of motor deficits after stroke. One of the most challenging experimental goals is to unambiguously link brain rewiring to motor improvement prompted by rehabilitative therapy. Previous work showed that robotic training combined with transient inactivation of the contralesional cortex promotes a generalized recovery in a mouse model of stroke. Here, we use advanced optical imaging and manipulation tools to study cortical remodeling induced by this rehabilitation paradigm. We show that the stabilization of peri-infarct synaptic contacts accompanies increased vascular density induced by angiogenesis. Furthermore, temporal and spatial features of cortical activation recover toward pre-stroke conditions through the progressive formation of a new motor representation in the peri-infarct area. In the same animals, we observe reinforcement of inter-hemispheric connectivity. Our results provide evidence that combined rehabilitation promotes the restoration of structural and functional features distinctive of healthy neuronal networks.

Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes H3K27 methylation across the genome, which impacts transcriptional regulation and is critical for establishment of cell identity. Because of its essential function during development and in cancer, understanding the delineation of genome-wide H3K27 methylation patterns has been the focus of intense investigation. PRC2 methylation activity is abundant and dispersed throughout the genome, but the highest activity is specifically directed to a subset of target sites that are stably occupied by the complex and highly enriched for H3K27me3. Here, we show, by systematically knocking out single and multiple non-core subunits of the PRC2 complex in mouse embryonic stem cells, that they each contribute to directing PRC2 activity to target sites. Furthermore, combined knockout of six non-core subunits reveals that, while dispensable for global H3K27 methylation levels, the non-core PRC2 subunits are collectively required for focusing H3K27me3 activity to specific sites in the genome.

Abstract: Summary
The olfactory environment is first represented by glomerular activity patterns in the olfactory bulb. It remains unclear how these representations intersect with sampling behavior to account for the time required to discriminate odors. Using different chemical classes, we investigate glomerular representations and sniffing behavior during olfactory decision-making. Mice rapidly discriminate odorants and learn to increase sniffing frequency at a fixed latency after trial initiation, independent of odor identity. Relative to the increase in sniffing frequency, monomolecular odorants are discriminated within 10–40 ms, while binary mixtures require an additional 60–70 ms. Intrinsic imaging of glomerular activity in anesthetized and awake mice reveals that Euclidean distance between activity patterns and the time needed for discriminations are anti-correlated. Therefore, the similarity of glomerular patterns and their activation strengths, rather than sampling behavior, define the extent of neuronal processing required for odor discrimination, establishing a neural metric to predict olfactory discrimination time.

Abstract: Summary
The gene expression programs that define the identity of each cell are controlled by master transcription factors (TFs) that bind cell-type-specific enhancers, as well as signaling factors, which bring extracellular stimuli to these enhancers. Recent studies have revealed that master TFs form phase-separated condensates with the Mediator coactivator at super-enhancers. Here, we present evidence that signaling factors for the WNT, TGF-β, and JAK/STAT pathways use their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to enter and concentrate in Mediator condensates at super-enhancers. We show that the WNT coactivator β-catenin interacts both with components of condensates and DNA-binding factors to selectively occupy super-enhancer-associated genes. We propose that the cell-type specificity of the response to signaling is mediated in part by the IDRs of the signaling factors, which cause these factors to partition into condensates established by the master TFs and Mediator at genes with prominent roles in cell identity.

Abstract: Summary
The NRL-PRL murine model, defined by mammary-selective transgenic rat prolactin ligand rPrl expression, establishes spontaneous ER+ mammary tumors in nulliparous females, mimicking the association between elevated prolactin (PRL) and risk for development of ER+ breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Whole-genome and exome sequencing in a discovery cohort (n = 5) of end-stage tumors revealed canonical activating mutations and copy number amplifications of Kras. The frequent mutations in this pathway were validated in an extension cohort, identifying activating Ras alterations in 79% of tumors (23 of 29). Transcriptome analyses over the course of oncogenesis revealed marked alterations associated with Ras activity in established tumors compared with preneoplastic tissues; in cell-intrinsic processes associated with mitosis, cell adhesion, and invasion; as well as in the surrounding tumor environment. These genomic analyses suggest that PRL induces a selective bottleneck for spontaneous Ras-driven tumors that may model a subset of aggressive clinical ER+ breast cancers.
