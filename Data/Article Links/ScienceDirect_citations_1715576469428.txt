Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes several proteins that inhibit host interferon responses. Among these, ORF6 antagonizes interferon signaling by disrupting nucleocytoplasmic trafficking through interactions with the nuclear pore complex components Nup98-Rae1. However, the roles and contributions of ORF6 during physiological infection remain unexplored. We assessed the role of ORF6 during infection using recombinant viruses carrying a deletion or loss-of-function (LoF) mutation in ORF6. ORF6 plays key roles in interferon antagonism and viral pathogenesis by interfering with nuclear import and specifically the translocation of IRF and STAT transcription factors. Additionally, ORF6 inhibits cellular mRNA export, resulting in the remodeling of the host cell proteome, and regulates viral protein expression. Interestingly, the ORF6:D61L mutation that emerged in the Omicron BA.2 and BA.4 variants exhibits reduced interactions with Nup98-Rae1 and consequently impairs immune evasion. Our findings highlight the role of ORF6 in antagonizing innate immunity and emphasize the importance of studying the immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with early-stage HER2-overexpressing breast cancer struggle with treatment resistance in 20%–40% of cases. More information is needed to predict HER2 therapy response and resistance in vivo. In this study, we perform (phospho)proteomics analysis of pre-treatment HER2+ needle biopsies of early-stage invasive breast cancer to identify molecular signatures predictive of treatment response to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and chemotherapy. Our data show that accurate quantification of the estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 biomarkers, combined with the assessment of associated biological features, has the potential to enable better treatment outcome prediction. In addition, we identify cellular mechanisms that potentially precondition tumors to resist therapy. We find proteins with expression changes that correlate with resistance and constitute to a strong predictive signature for treatment success in our patient cohort. Our results highlight the multifactorial nature of drug resistance in vivo and demonstrate the necessity of deep tumor profiling.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms that underlie homeostatic plasticity have been extensively investigated at single-cell levels in animal models, but are less well understood at the network level. Here, we used microelectrode arrays to characterize neuronal networks following induction of homeostatic plasticity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons co-cultured with rat astrocytes. Chronic suppression of neuronal activity through tetrodotoxin (TTX) elicited a time-dependent network re-arrangement. Increased expression of AMPA receptors and the elongation of axon initial segments were associated with increased network excitability following TTX treatment. Transcriptomic profiling of TTX-treated neurons revealed up-regulated genes related to extracellular matrix organization, while down-regulated genes related to cell communication; also astrocytic gene expression was found altered. Overall, our study shows that hiPSC-derived neuronal networks provide a reliable in vitro platform to measure and characterize homeostatic plasticity at network and single-cell levels; this platform can be extended to investigate altered homeostatic plasticity in brain disorders.

Abstract: In the current investigation, we explored the benefits of aucubin against rodent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damages in brains and elucidated the role of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in its neuroprotective action. I/R model of brain was established in male three-month-old rats through 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by two days of reperfusion. Aucubin boosted phosphorylation of AMPKα in ipsilateral cortex of injured rats. Then, rats were exposed to cerebral I/R damage and received treatment of aucubin and compound C (a well-known AMPK inhibitor). It was found that aucubin administration improved neurological symptom score, decreased infarct volume, and mitigated cerebral edema in injured rats. Aucubin administration upregulated Nrf2 expression and abated oxidative stress in ipsilateral cortex of injured rats. Aucubin administration reduced levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppressed microglial activation and neutrophil infiltration, and promoted M2 polarization in injured rats. More importantly, compound C abolished the neuroprotective, anti-oxidant and inflammation-modulating effects of aucubin in injured rats, at least in part. Therefore, we concluded that activation of AMPK by aucubin alleviated I/R injury in brain through abating oxidative stress and suppressing inflammation, identifying a potential candidate for those patients of ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Summary
The antiviral DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B has been implicated as a source of mutation in many cancers. However, despite years of work, a causal relationship has yet to be established in vivo. Here, we report a murine model that expresses tumor-like levels of human APOBEC3B. Animals expressing full-body APOBEC3B appear to develop normally. However, adult males manifest infertility, and older animals of both sexes show accelerated rates of carcinogenesis, visual and molecular tumor heterogeneity, and metastasis. Both primary and metastatic tumors exhibit increased frequencies of C-to-T mutations in TC dinucleotide motifs consistent with the established biochemical activity of APOBEC3B. Enrichment for APOBEC3B-attributable single base substitution mutations also associates with elevated levels of insertion-deletion mutations and structural variations. APOBEC3B catalytic activity is required for all of these phenotypes. Together, these studies provide a cause-and-effect demonstration that human APOBEC3B is capable of driving both tumor initiation and evolution in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of antimicrobial proteins such as REG3 family members compromises the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Here, we demonstrate that overproduction of REG3 proteins can also be detrimental by reducing a protective species in the microbiota. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experiencing flares displayed heightened levels of secreted REG3 proteins that mediated depletion of Enterococcus faecium (Efm) from the gut microbiota. Efm inoculation of mice ameliorated intestinal inflammation through activation of the innate immune receptor NOD2, which was associated with the bacterial DL-endopeptidase SagA that generates NOD2-stimulating muropeptides. NOD2 activation in myeloid cells induced interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion to increase the proportion of IL-22-producing CD4+ T helper cells and innate lymphoid cells that promote tissue repair. Finally, Efm was unable to protect mice carrying a NOD2 gene variant commonly found in IBD patients. Our findings demonstrate that inflammation self-perpetuates by causing aberrant antimicrobial activity that disrupts symbiotic relationships with gut microbes.

Abstract: Vascular calcification (VC) is a common pathological process of cardiovascular disease that occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the molecular basis of VC progression remains unknown. A GEO dataset (GSE146638) was analyzed to show that microbodies and IL-1β may play important roles in the pathophysiology of VC. The release of matrix vesicle bodies (MVBs) and IL-1β and the colocalization of IL-1β with MVBs or autophagosomes were studied by immunofluorescence in an in vivo diabetes mouse model with aortic calcification and an in vitro high glucose cell calcification model. MVB numbers, IL-1β levels and autophagy were increased in calcified mouse aortas and calcified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). IL-1β colocalized with MVBs and autophagosomes. The MVBs from calcified VSMCs induced the calcification of normal recipient VSMCs, and this effect was alleviated by silencing IL-1β. The autophagy inducer rapamycin reduced IL-1β expression and calcification in VSMCs, while these processes were induced by the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. In conclusion, our results suggested that MVBs could carry IL-1β out of cells and induce VC in normal VSMCs, and these processes could be counteracted by autophagy. These results suggested that MVB-mediated IL-1β release may be an effective target for treating vascular calcification.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an important factor in maintaining homeostasis at mucosal surfaces, yet luminal IgA levels vary widely. Total IgA levels are thought to be driven by individual immune responses to specific microbes. Here, we found that the prebiotic, pectin oligosaccharide (pec-oligo), induced high IgA levels in the small intestine in a T cell-dependent manner. Surprisingly, this IgA-high phenotype was retained after cessation of pec-oligo treatment, and microbiome transmission either horizontally or vertically was sufficient to retain high IgA levels in the absence of pec-oligo. Interestingly, the bacterial taxa enriched in the overall pec-oligo bacterial community differed from IgA-coated microbes in this same community. Rather, a group of ethanol-resistant microbes, highly enriched for Lachnospiraceae bacterium A2, drove the IgA-high phenotype. These findings support a model of intestinal adaptive immunity in which a limited number of microbes can promote durable changes in IgA directed to many symbionts.

Abstract: Summary
During intestinal inflammation, host nutritional immunity starves microbes of essential micronutrients, such as iron. Pathogens scavenge iron using siderophores, including enterobactin; however, this strategy is counteracted by host protein lipocalin-2, which sequesters iron-laden enterobactin. Although this iron competition occurs in the presence of gut bacteria, the roles of commensals in nutritional immunity involving iron remain unexplored. Here, we report that the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron acquires iron and sustains its resilience in the inflamed gut by utilizing siderophores produced by other bacteria, including Salmonella, via a secreted siderophore-binding lipoprotein XusB. Notably, XusB-bound enterobactin is less accessible to host sequestration by lipocalin-2 but can be “re-acquired” by Salmonella, allowing the pathogen to evade nutritional immunity. Because the host and pathogen have been the focus of studies of nutritional immunity, this work adds commensal iron metabolism as a previously unrecognized mechanism modulating the host-pathogen interactions and nutritional immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Simultaneous inhibition of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) with bispecific antibodies may improve efficacy over single-agent treatment while limiting toxicity. Cadonilimab is a humanized, bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. This is a phase 1 study of cadonilimab including dose escalation (n = 39) and dose expansion (n = 80). One dose-limiting toxicity event is observed, with the maximum tolerated dose not reached. 6 mg/kg cadonilimab once every 2 weeks is established as the recommended dose for future studies. The most common treatment-related adverse event is infusion-related reaction (18.5%), mostly grade 1/2 in severity. The incidences of any grade and grade ≥3 immune-related adverse events are 44.5% and 6.7%, respectively. The confirmed overall response rate is 13.4%, and the median duration of response is 12.9 months. Cadonilimab is well tolerated and showed promising efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03261011.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and Cas proteins work together to provide prokaryotes with adaptive immunity against genetic invaders like bacteriophages and plasmids. However, the coordination of crRNA production and cas expression remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that widespread modulatory mini-CRISPRs encode cas-regulating RNAs (CreRs) that mediate autorepression of type I-B, I-E, and V-A Cas proteins, based on their limited complementarity to cas promoters. This autorepression not only reduces autoimmune risks but also responds to changes in the abundance of canonical crRNAs that compete with CreR for Cas proteins. Furthermore, the CreR-guided autorepression of Cas proteins can be alleviated or even subverted by diverse bacteriophage anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit Cas effectors, which, in turn, promotes the generation of new Cas proteins. Our findings reveal a general RNA-guided autorepression paradigm for diverse Cas effectors, shedding light on the intricate self-coordination of CRISPR-Cas and its transcriptional counterstrategy against Acr proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungal pathogen that kills over 112,000 people each year, differ from a 19-Mb reference genome at a few thousand up to almost a million DNA sequence positions. We used bulked segregant analysis and association analysis, genetic methods that require no prior knowledge of sequence function, to address the key question of which naturally occurring sequence variants influence fungal virulence. We identified a region containing such variants, prioritized them, and engineered strains to test our findings in a mouse model of infection. At one locus, we identified a 4-nt variant in the PDE2 gene that occurs in common laboratory strains and severely truncates the encoded phosphodiesterase. The resulting loss of phosphodiesterase activity significantly impacts virulence. Our studies demonstrate a powerful and unbiased strategy for identifying key genomic regions in the absence of prior information and provide significant sequence and strain resources to the community.

Abstract: Summary
A challenge for screening new anticancer drugs is that efficacy in cell culture models is not always predictive of efficacy in patients. One limitation of standard cell culture is a reliance on non-physiological nutrient levels, which can influence cell metabolism and drug sensitivity. A general assessment of how physiological nutrients affect cancer cell response to small molecule therapies is lacking. To address this, we developed a serum-derived culture medium that supports the proliferation of diverse cancer cell lines and is amenable to high-throughput screening. We screened several small molecule libraries and found that compounds targeting metabolic enzymes were differentially effective in standard compared to serum-derived medium. We exploited the differences in nutrient levels between each medium to understand why medium conditions affected the response of cells to some compounds, illustrating how this approach can be used to screen potential therapeutics and understand how their efficacy is modified by available nutrients.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple myeloma (MM) growth is supported by an immune-tolerant bone marrow microenvironment. Here, we find that loss of Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 (NEK2) in tumor microenvironmental cells is associated with MM growth suppression. The absence of NEK2 leads to both fewer tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and inhibitory T cells. NEK2 expression in myeloid progenitor cells promotes the generation of functional TAMs when stimulated with MM conditional medium. Clinically, high NEK2 expression in MM cells is associated with increased CD8+ T effector memory cells, while low NEK2 is associated with an IFN-γ gene signature and activated T cell response. Inhibition of NEK2 upregulates PD-L1 expression in MM cells and myeloid cells. In a mouse model, the combination of NEK2 inhibitor INH154 with PD-L1 blockade effectively eliminates MM cells and prolongs survival. Our results provide strong evidence that NEK2 inhibition may overcome tumor immune escape and support its further clinical development.

Abstract: Metabolic adaptations are central for carcinogenesis and response to therapy, but little is known about the contribution of mitochondrial dynamics to the response of glioma cells to the standard treatment with temozolomide (TMZ). Glioma cells responded to TMZ with mitochondrial mass increased and the production of round structures of dysfunctional mitochondria. At single-cell level, asymmetric mitosis contributed to the heterogeneity of mitochondrial levels. It affected the fitness of cells in control and treated condition, indicating that the mitochondrial levels are relevant for glioma cell fitness in the presence of TMZ.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which the early-life microbiota protects against environmental factors that promote childhood obesity remain largely unknown. Using a mouse model in which young mice are simultaneously exposed to antibiotics and a high-fat (HF) diet, we show that Lactobacillus species, predominant members of the small intestine (SI) microbiota, regulate intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to limit diet-induced obesity during early life. A Lactobacillus-derived metabolite, phenyllactic acid (PLA), protects against metabolic dysfunction caused by early-life exposure to antibiotics and a HF diet by increasing the abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) in SI IECs. Therefore, PLA is a microbiota-derived metabolite that activates protective pathways in the small intestinal epithelium to regulate intestinal lipid metabolism and prevent antibiotic-associated obesity during early life.

Abstract: Summary
Nearly one-half of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) carry the homozygous F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene but exhibit variable lung function phenotypes. How adaptive immunity influences their lung function remains unclear, particularly the serological antibody responses to antigens from mucoid Pseudomonas in sera from patients with CF with varying lung function. Sera from patients with CF with reduced lung function show higher anti-outer membrane protein I (OprI) immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) titers and greater antibody-mediated complement deposition. Induction of anti-OprI antibody isotypes with complement activity enhances lung inflammation in preclinical mouse models. This enhanced inflammation is absent in immunized Rag2−/− mice and is transferrable to unimmunized mice through sera. In a CF cohort undergoing treatment with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, the declination in anti-OprI IgG1 titers is associated with lung function improvement and reduced hospitalizations. These findings suggest that antibody responses to specific Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) antigens worsen lung function in patients with CF.

Abstract: The experimental myocardial infarction (MI) model originating from isoproterenol (ISO) is frequently preferred in research due to its similarity to MI-induced damage in humans. Beneficial effects of L-arginine (L-Arg), a semi-essential amino acid, in cardiovascular diseases have been shown in many studies. This study was carried out to determine whether L-Arg pre-intervention has protective effects on heart tissue in the experimental MI model. The 28 rats used in the study were randomly divided into 4 equal groups: control, L-Arg, ISO, and L-Arg+ISO. Upon completion of all applications, cardiac markers in serum and biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical examinations in cardiac tissues were performed. Cardiac markers, histopathological changes, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were increased in the experimental MI model. In addition, administration of ISO deregulated OTULIN levels and mitochondrial dynamics in heart tissue. However, L-Arg pre-intervention showed a significant protective effect against changes in ISO-induced MI. L-Arg supplementation with cardioprotective effect may reduce the risks of possible pathophysiological processes in MI.

Abstract: Summary
The definitive diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) currently relies on invasive and labor-intensive liver biopsy. Here, we identified soluble CUB domain-containing protein 1 (sCDCP1) as a top-ranked non-invasive biomarker for NASH using Olink-based proteomics in 238 obese individuals with liver biopsies. Both the circulating concentration and hepatic mRNA abundance of sCDCP1 were significantly elevated in patients with NASH and correlated closely with each histological feature of NASH. In the pooled multicenter validation cohort, sCDCP1 as a standalone biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.838 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.789–0.887) for diagnosing NASH, which is better than those achieved with cytokeratin-18 and other non-invasive tests. Furthermore, the C-DAG model established by the combination of sCDCP1 with diabetes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gender accurately rules in and rules out both NASH and fibrotic NASH (gray zones <20%). Thus, sCDCP1-based non-invasive tests can be potentially implemented for screening and early diagnosis of NASH and for ruling out low-risk individuals to avoid unnecessary liver biopsies.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle research is transitioning toward 3D tissue engineered in vitro models reproducing muscle’s native architecture and supporting measurement of functionality. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer high yields of cells for differentiation. It has been difficult to differentiate high-quality, pure 3D muscle tissues from hiPSCs that show contractile properties comparable to primary myoblast-derived tissues. Here, we present a transgene-free method for the generation of purified, expandable myogenic progenitors (MPs) from hiPSCs grown under feeder-free conditions. We defined a protocol with optimal hydrogel and medium conditions that allowed production of highly contractile 3D tissue engineered skeletal muscles with forces similar to primary myoblast-derived tissues. Gene expression and proteomic analysis between hiPSC-derived and primary myoblast-derived 3D tissues revealed a similar expression profile of proteins involved in myogenic differentiation and sarcomere function. The protocol should be generally applicable for the study of personalized human skeletal muscle tissue in health and disease.

Abstract: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) remains a neurosurgical condition and a healthy burden especially in elderly patients. This study focuses on the functions of rapamycin and its related molecular mechanisms in CSDH management. A rat model of CSDH was induced, which developed significant hematoma on day 5 after operation. The rats were treated with rapamycin or atorvastatin, a drug with known effect on hematoma alleviation, or treated with rapamycin and atorvastatin in combination. The atorvastatin or rapamycin treatment reduced the hematoma development, blood-brain barrier permeability, neurological dysfunction in CSDH rats, and the combination treatment showed more pronounced effects. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells hCMEC/D3 were stimulated by hematoma samples to mimic a CSDH condition in vitro. The drug treatments elevated the cell junction-related factors and reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines both in rat hematoma tissues and in hCMEC/D3 cells. Rapamycin suppressed the mTOR and STAT3 signaling pathways. Overexpression of mTOR or the STAT3 agonist suppressed the alleviating effects of rapamycin on CSDH. In summary, this study demonstrates that rapamycin promotes hematoma resorption and enhances endothelial cell function by suppressing the mTOR/STAT3 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated iron homeostasis underlies diverse pathologies, from ischemia-reperfusion injury to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and drug-tolerant “persister” cancer cell states. Here, we introduce ferrous iron-activatable luciferin-1 (FeAL-1), a small-molecule probe for bioluminescent imaging of the labile iron pool (LIP) in luciferase-expressing cells and animals. We find that FeAL-1 detects LIP fluctuations in cells after iron supplementation, depletion, or treatment with hepcidin, the master regulator of systemic iron in mammalian physiology. Utilizing FeAL-1 and a dual-luciferase reporter system, we quantify LIP in mouse liver and three different orthotopic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors. We observed up to a 10-fold increase in FeAL-1 bioluminescent signal in xenograft tumors as compared to healthy liver, the major organ of iron storage in mammals. Treating mice with hepcidin further elevated hepatic LIP, as predicted. These studies reveal a therapeutic index between tumoral and hepatic LIP and suggest an approach to sensitize tumors toward LIP-activated therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Although promising, dendritic cell (DC) vaccines still provide limited clinical benefits, mainly due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the lack of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Oncolytic virus therapy is an ideal strategy to overcome immunosuppression and expose TAAs; therefore, they may work synergistically with DC vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that oncolytic virus M1 (OVM) can enhance the antitumor effects of DC vaccines across diverse syngeneic mouse tumor models by increasing the infiltration of CD8+ effector T cells in the TME. Mechanically, we show that tumor cells counteract DC vaccines through the SIRPα-CD47 immune checkpoint, while OVM can downregulate SIRPα in DCs and CD47 in tumor cells. Since OVM upregulates PD-L1 in DCs, combining PD-L1 blockade with DC vaccines and OVM further enhances antitumor activity. Overall, OVM strengthens the antitumor efficacy of DC vaccines by targeting the SIRPα-CD47 axis, which exerts dominant immunosuppressive effects on DC vaccines.

Abstract: Apoptosis is a key defense process for multiple immune system functions, playing a central role in maintaining homeostasis and cell development. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of environmental pollutant exposure on immune-related apoptotic pathways in crab tissues and human cells. To do this, we characterized the multifunctional immune complement component 1q (C1q) gene and analyzed C1q expression in Macrophthalmus japonicus crabs after exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) or hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs). Moreover, the responses of apoptotic signal-related genes were observed in M. japonicus tissues and human cell lines (HEK293T and HCT116). C1q gene expression was downregulated in the gills and hepatopancreas of M. japonicus after exposure to DEHP or HBCD. Pollutant exposure also increased antioxidant enzyme activities and altered transcription of 15 apoptotic signaling genes in M. japonicus. However, patterns in apoptotic signaling in response to these pollutants differed in human cells. HBCD exposure generated an apoptotic signal (cleaved caspase-3) and inhibited cell growth in both cell lines, whereas DEHP exposure did not produce such a response. These results suggest that exposure to environmental pollutants induced different levels of immune-related apoptosis depending on the cell or tissue type and that this induction of apoptotic signaling may trigger an initiation of carcinogenesis in M. japonicus and in humans as consumers.

Abstract: Summary
Allogeneic invariant natural killer T cells (allo-iNKTs) induce clinical remission in patients with otherwise incurable cancers and COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure. However, their functionality is inconsistent among individuals, and they become rapidly undetectable after infusion, raising concerns over rejection and limited therapeutic potential. We validate a strategy to promote allo-iNKT persistence in dogs, an established large-animal model for novel cellular therapies. We identify donor-specific iNKT biomarkers of survival and sustained functionality, conserved in dogs and humans and retained upon chimeric antigen receptor engineering. We reason that infusing optimal allo-iNKTs enriched in these biomarkers will prolong their persistence without requiring MHC ablation, high-intensity chemotherapy, or cytokine supplementation. Optimal allo-iNKTs transferred into MHC-mismatched dogs remain detectable for at least 78 days, exhibiting sustained immunomodulatory effects. Our canine model will accelerate biomarker discovery of optimal allo-iNKT products, furthering application of MHC-unedited allo-iNKTs as a readily accessible universal platform to treat incurable conditions worldwide.

Abstract: Atrophic nonunion (AN) is a complex and poorly understood pathological condition resulting from impaired fracture healing. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several bone disorders, including osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. However, the role of AGEs in the development of AN remains unclear. This study found that mice fed a high-AGE diet had a higher incidence of atrophic nonunion (AN) compared to mice fed a normal diet following tibial fractures. AGEs induced two C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs), CtBP1 and CtBP2, which were necessary for the development of AN in response to AGE accumulation. Feeding a high-AGE diet after fracture surgery in CtBP1/2−/− and RAGE−/− (receptor of AGE) mice did not result in a significant occurrence of AN. Molecular investigation revealed that CtBP1 and CtBP2 formed a heterodimer that was recruited by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) to assemble a complex. The CtBP1/2-HDAC1-Runx2 complex was responsible for the downregulation of two classes of bone development and differentiation genes, including bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These findings demonstrate that AGE accumulation promotes the incidence of AN in a CtBP1/2-dependent manner, possibly by modulating genes related to bone development and fracture healing. These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of AN and suggest new therapeutic targets for its prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Sporadic synchronous colorectal cancer (SCRC) refers to multiple primary CRC tumors detected simultaneously in an individual without predisposing hereditary conditions, which accounts for the majority of multiple CRCs while lacking a profound understanding of the genomic landscape and evolutionary dynamics to optimize its treatment. In this study, 103 primary tumor samples from 51 patients with SCRC undergo whole-exome sequencing. The germline and somatic mutations and evolutionary and clinical features are comprehensively investigated. Somatic genetic events are largely inconsistent between paired tumors. Compared with solitary CRC, SCRCs have higher prevalence of tumor mutation burden high (TMB-H; 33.3%) and microsatellite-instability high (MSI-H; 29.4%) and different mutation frequencies in oncogenic signaling pathways. Moreover, neutrally evolving SCRC tumors are associated with higher intratumoral heterogeneity and better prognosis. These findings unveil special molecular features, carcinogenesis, and prognosis of sporadic SCRC. Strategies for targeted therapy and immunotherapy should be optimized accordingly.

Abstract: Salinity is important abiotic factor influencing sea cucumber aquaculture. This study aimed to identify and functional study of a novel transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1) involved in salinity stress through interaction with miR-2013 in the sea cucumber. The full-length cDNA sequence was 1369 bp in length and encoded 138 amino acids. The TRPA1 homolog protein was a hydrophilic protein without a signal peptide and was predicted to a spatial structure of seven helices and eight random coils and two major ANK functional domains. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assays confirmed TRPA1 as a target gene of miR-2013. Quantitative PCR revealed that miR-2013 was induced upregulation after salinity stress, while TRPA1 showed upregulated expression with maximum expression at 24 h. The expression of miR-2013 and TRPA1 was negatively regulated. Transfection experiments were conducted to validate the role of miR-2013 and TRPA1 in salinity response. The results showed that miR-2013 was upregulated and TRPA1 was downregulated after transfection with miR-2013 mimics, while miR-2013 was downregulated and TRPA1 was upregulated after transfection with miR-2013 inhibitor. Transfection with si-TRPA1 homolog resulted in upregulation of miR-2013 and downregulation of TRPA1 homolog. These findings suggest that miR-2013 can regulate the expression of TRPA1 under salt stress, and highlight the importance of miR-2013 and TRPA1 in salt stress response. miR-2013 mimics improved the survival rate, while miR-2013 inhibitor and si-TRPA1 reduced it. These findings suggest that miR-2013 and TRPA1 play important roles in sea cucumbers adaptation to salinity changes.

Abstract: Summary
The complex interplay between microbiota and immunity is important to human health. To explore how altered adaptive immunity influences the microbiome, we characterize skin, nares, and gut microbiota of patients with recombination-activating gene (RAG) deficiency—a rare genetically defined inborn error of immunity (IEI) that results in a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Integrating de novo assembly of metagenomes from RAG-deficient patients with reference genome catalogs provides an expansive multi-kingdom view of microbial diversity. RAG-deficient patient microbiomes exhibit inter-individual variation, including expansion of opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Corynebacterium bovis, Haemophilus influenzae), and a relative loss of body site specificity. We identify 35 and 27 bacterial species derived from skin/nares and gut microbiomes, respectively, which are distinct to RAG-deficient patients compared to healthy individuals. Underscoring IEI patients as potential reservoirs for viral persistence and evolution, we further characterize the colonization of eukaryotic RNA viruses (e.g., Coronavirus 229E, Norovirus GII) in this patient population.

Abstract: Summary
Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, as a hallmark of heterochromatin, has a central role in cell lineage and fate determination. Although evidence of a cooperation between H3K9 methylation writers and their readers has started to emerge, their actual interplay remains elusive. Here, we show that loss of H3K9 methylation readers, the Hp1 family, causes reduced expression of H3K9 methyltransferases, and that this subsequently leads to the exit of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from pluripotency and a reciprocal gain of lineage-specific characteristics. Importantly, the phenotypes of Hp1-null ESCs can be rescued by ectopic expression of Setdb1, Nanog, and Oct4. Furthermore, Setdb1 ablation results in loss of ESC identity, which is accompanied by a reduction in the expression of Hp1 genes. Together, our data support a model in which the safeguarding of ESC identity involves the cooperation between the H3K9 methylation writers and their readers.

Abstract: Summary
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is molecularly heterogeneous, immune infiltrated, and selectively sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). However, the joint tumor-immune states that mediate ICI response remain elusive. We develop spatially aware deep-learning models of tumor and immune features to learn representations of ccRCC tumors using diagnostic whole-slide images (WSIs) in untreated and treated contexts (n = 1,102 patients). We identify patterns of grade heterogeneity in WSIs not achievable through human pathologist analysis, and these graph-based “microheterogeneity” structures associate with PBRM1 loss of function and with patient outcomes. Joint analysis of tumor phenotypes and immune infiltration identifies a subpopulation of highly infiltrated, microheterogeneous tumors responsive to ICI. In paired multiplex immunofluorescence images of ccRCC, microheterogeneity associates with greater PD1 activation in CD8+ lymphocytes and increased tumor-immune interactions. Our work reveals spatially interacting tumor-immune structures underlying ccRCC biology that may also inform selective response to ICI.

Abstract: Summary
A complete knockout of a single key pluripotency gene may drastically affect embryonic stem cell function and epigenetic reprogramming. In contrast, elimination of only one allele of a single pluripotency gene is mostly considered harmless to the cell. To understand whether complex haploinsufficiency exists in pluripotent cells, we simultaneously eliminated a single allele in different combinations of two pluripotency genes (i.e., Nanog+/−;Sall4+/−, Nanog+/−;Utf1+/−, Nanog+/−;Esrrb+/− and Sox2+/−;Sall4+/−). Although these double heterozygous mutant lines similarly contribute to chimeras, fibroblasts derived from these systems show a significant decrease in their ability to induce pluripotency. Tracing the stochastic expression of Sall4 and Nanog at early phases of reprogramming could not explain the seen delay or blockage. Further exploration identifies abnormal methylation around pluripotent and developmental genes in the double heterozygous mutant fibroblasts, which could be rescued by hypomethylating agent or high OSKM levels. This study emphasizes the importance of maintaining two intact alleles for pluripotency induction.

Abstract: Summary
Neutralizing antibodies targeting HIV-1 Env have been shown to protect from systemic infection. To explore whether these antibodies can inhibit infection of the first cells, challenge viruses based on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were developed that use HIV-1 Env for entry into target cells during the first replication cycle, but then switch to SIV Env usage. Antibodies binding to Env of HIV-1, but not SIV, block HIV-1 Env-mediated infection events after rectal exposure of non-human primates to the switching challenge virus. After natural exposure to HIV-1, such a reduction of the number of first infection events should be sufficient to provide sterilizing immunity in the strictest sense in most of the exposed individuals. Since blocking infection of the first cells avoids the formation of latently infected cells and reduces the risk of emergence of antibody-resistant mutants, it may be the best mode of protection.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults. Although they exist in different malignant stages, most gliomas are clinically challenging because of their infiltrative growth patterns and inherent relapse tendency with increased malignancy. Epigenetic alterations have been suggested to be an important factor for glioma genesis. Using mRNA probe hybridization, we identified SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) as the most significantly upregulated SUMOylation regulator in glioma. Moreover, SENP1 was overexpressed in gliomas and predicted poor prognoses. Depletion of SENP1 reduced glioma cell activity, cycle arrest, and increased apoptotic activity. Mechanistically, SENP1 inhibited the protein expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) through de-SUMOylation, and SIRT1 inhibited the activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) by deacetylation. Rescue experiments revealed that downregulation of SIRT1 reversed the inhibitory effect of sh-SENP1 on glioma cell malignant phenotype, while downregulation of NF-κB reversed the activating effect of sh-SIRT1 on glioma cell malignant phenotype. Thus, SENP1-mediated de-SUMOylation of SIRT1 might be therapeutically important in gliomas.

Abstract: Summary
First-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is mechanistically linked to type 2 diabetes, yet the underlying metabolism is difficult to discern due to significant islet-to-islet variability. Here, we miniaturize a fluorescence anisotropy immunoassay onto a microfluidic device to measure C-peptide secretion from individual islets as a surrogate for insulin (InsC-chip). This method measures secretion from up to four islets at a time with ∼7 s resolution while providing an optical window for real-time live-cell imaging. Using the InsC-chip, we reveal two glucose-dependent peaks of insulin secretion (i.e., a double peak) within the classically defined 1st phase (<10 min). By combining real-time secretion and live-cell imaging, we show islets transition from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-driven metabolism at the nadir of the peaks. Overall, these data validate the InsC-chip to measure glucose-stimulated insulin secretion while revealing new dynamics in secretion defined by a shift in glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Hallmarks include desmoplasia with variable extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture and a complex microenvironment with spatially defined tumor, stromal, and immune populations. Nevertheless, the role of desmoplastic spatial organization in patient/tumor variability remains underexplored, which we elucidate using two technologies. First, we quantify ECM patterning in 437 patients, revealing architectures associated with disease-free and overall survival. Second, we spatially profile the cellular milieu of 78 specimens using codetection by indexing, identifying an axis of pro-inflammatory cell interactions predictive of poorer outcomes. We discover that clinical characteristics, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy status, tumor stage, and ECM architecture, correlate with differential stromal-immune organization, including fibroblast subtypes with distinct niches. Lastly, we define unified signatures that predict survival with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.872–0.903, differentiating survivorship by 655 days. Overall, our findings establish matrix ultrastructural and cellular organizations of fibrosis linked to poorer outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL), characterized by excessive accumulation of phospholipids in lysosomes, can lead to clinical adverse effects. It may also alter phenotypic responses in functional studies using chemical probes. Therefore, robust methods are needed to predict and quantify phospholipidosis (PL) early in drug discovery and in chemical probe characterization. Here, we present a versatile high-content live-cell imaging approach, which was used to evaluate a chemogenomic and a lysosomal modulation library. We trained and evaluated several machine learning models using the most comprehensive set of publicly available compounds and interpreted the best model using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Analysis of high-quality chemical probes extracted from the Chemical Probes Portal using our algorithm revealed that closely related molecules, such as chemical probes and their matched negative controls can differ in their ability to induce PL, highlighting the importance of identifying PL for robust target validation in chemical biology.

Abstract: Summary
Synapse loss correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Data from mouse models suggests microglia are important for synapse degeneration, but direct human evidence for any glial involvement in synapse removal in human AD remains to be established. Here we observe astrocytes and microglia from human brains contain greater amounts of synaptic protein in AD compared with non-disease controls, and that proximity to amyloid-β plaques and the APOE4 risk gene exacerbate this effect. In culture, mouse and human astrocytes and primary mouse and human microglia phagocytose AD patient-derived synapses more than synapses from controls. Inhibiting interactions of MFG-E8 rescues the elevated engulfment of AD synapses by astrocytes and microglia without affecting control synapse uptake. Thus, AD promotes increased synapse ingestion by human glial cells at least in part via an MFG-E8 opsonophagocytic mechanism with potential for targeted therapeutic manipulation.

Abstract: Hypertension is a multifactorial disease characterized by vascular and renal dysfunction, cardiovascular remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis, all of which are associated with oxidative stress. We previously demonstrated cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) imbalances may impact the structural and biochemical functions of blood cells and reported downregulation of β-dystroglycan (β-Dg) and overexpression of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) contribute to the pathophysiology of hypertension. In this study, we aimed to determine the expression of dystroglycans (Dg) and ENaC in platelet progenitors (megakaryocytes) and their surrounding niches. Thin sections of bone marrow from 5- and 28-week-old spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) were compared to age-matched normotensive rats (WKY). Cytometry and immunohistochemical assays demonstrated an oxidative environment in SHR bone marrow, characterized by high levels of myeloperoxidase and 3-nitrotyrosine and downregulation of peroxiredoxin II. In addition, transmission electron micrography and confocal microscopy revealed morphological changes in platelets and Mgks from SHR rats, including swollen mitochondria. Quantitative qRT-PCR assays confirmed downregulation of Dg mRNA and immunohistochemistry and western-blotting validated low expression of β-Dg, mainly in the phosphorylated form, in Mgks from 28-week-old SHR rats. Moreover, we observed a progressive increase in β-1 integrin expression in Mgks and extracellular matrix proteins in Mgk niches in SHR rats compared to WKY controls. These results indicate accumulation of ROS promotes oxidative stress within the bone marrow environment and detrimentally affects cellular homeostasis in hypertensive individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated the large-scale characterization of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires. However, the vast amount and high diversity of the BCR sequences pose challenges for efficient and biologically meaningful analysis. Here, we introduce fastBCR, an efficient computational approach for inferring B cell clonal families from massive BCR heavy chain sequences. We demonstrate that fastBCR substantially reduces the running time while ensuring high accuracy on simulated datasets with diverse numbers of B cell lineages and varying mutation rates. We apply fastBCR to real BCR sequencing data from peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients, showing that the inferred clonal families display disease-associated features, as well as corresponding antigen-binding specificity and affinity. Overall, our results demonstrate the advantages of fastBCR for analyzing BCR repertoire data, which will facilitate the identification of disease-associated antibodies and improve our understanding of the B cell immune response.

Abstract: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a wide-ranging cellular response to accumulation of malfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acts as a quality control mechanism to halt protein processing and repair/destroy malfolded proteins under stress conditions of many kinds. Among vertebrate species, amphibians experience the greatest challenges in maintaining water and osmotic balance, the high permeability of their skin making them very susceptible to dehydration and challenging their ability to maintain cellular homeostasis. The present study evaluates the involvement of the UPR in dealing with dehydration-mediated disruption of protein processing in the tissues of African clawed frogs, Xenopus laevis. This primarily aquatic frog must deal with seasonal drought conditions in its native southern Africa environment. Key markers of cellular stress that impact protein processing were identified in six tissues of frogs that had lost 28% of total body water, as compared with fully hydrated controls. This included upregulation of glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) that are resident chaperones in the ER, particularly 2–ninefold increases in GRP58, GRP75, and/or GRP94 in the lung and skin. Activating transcription factors (ATF3, ATF4, ATF6) that mediate UPR responses also responded to dehydration stress, particularly in skeletal muscle where both ATF3 and ATF4 rose strongly in the nucleus. Other protein markers of the UPR including GADD34, GADD153, EDEM, and XBP-1 also showed selective upregulation in frog tissues in response to dehydration and nuclear levels of the transcription factors XBP-1 and P-CREB rose indicating up-regulation of genes under their control.

Abstract: Summary
Decades of research have not yet fully explained the mechanisms of epithelial self-organization and 3D packing. Single-cell analysis of large 3D epithelial libraries is crucial for understanding the assembly and function of whole tissues. Combining 3D epithelial imaging with advanced deep-learning segmentation methods is essential for enabling this high-content analysis. We introduce CartoCell, a deep-learning-based pipeline that uses small datasets to generate accurate labels for hundreds of whole 3D epithelial cysts. Our method detects the realistic morphology of epithelial cells and their contacts in the 3D structure of the tissue. CartoCell enables the quantification of geometric and packing features at the cellular level. Our single-cell cartography approach then maps the distribution of these features on 2D plots and 3D surface maps, revealing cell morphology patterns in epithelial cysts. Additionally, we show that CartoCell can be adapted to other types of epithelial tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the effects of the microbiome on the host’s metabolism is core to enlightening the role of the microbiome in health and disease. Herein, we develop the paradigm of in silico in vivo association pattern analyses, combining microbiome metabolome association studies with in silico constraint-based community modeling. Via theoretical dissection of confounding and causal paths, we show that in silico in vivo association pattern analyses allow for causal inference on microbiome-metabolome relations in observational data. We justify the corresponding theoretical criterion by structural equation modeling of host-microbiome systems, integrating deterministic microbiome community modeling into population statistics approaches. We show the feasibility of our approach on a published multi-omics dataset (n = 347), demonstrating causal microbiome-metabolite relations for 26 out of 54 fecal metabolites. In summary, we generate a promising approach for causal inference in metabolic host-microbiome interactions by integrating hypothesis-free screening association studies with knowledge-based in silico modeling.

Abstract: Summary
The direct conversion of human skin fibroblasts to neurons has a low efficiency and unclear mechanism. Here, we show that the knockdown of PTBP2 significantly enhanced the transdifferentiation induced by ASCL1, MIR9/9∗-124, and p53 shRNA (AMp) to generate mostly GABAergic neurons. Longitudinal RNA sequencing analyses identified the continuous induction of many RNA splicing regulators. Among these, the knockdown of RBFOX3 (NeuN), significantly abrogated the transdifferentiation. Overexpression of RBFOX3 significantly enhanced the conversion induced by AMp; the enhancement was occluded by PTBP2 knockdown. We found that PTBP2 attenuation significantly favored neuron-specific alternative splicing (AS) of many genes involved in synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and axon formation. RBFOX3 knockdown significantly reversed the effect, while RBFOX3 overexpression occluded the enhancement. The study reveals the critical role of neuron-specific AS in the direct conversion of human skin fibroblasts to neurons by showing that PTBP2 attenuation enhances this mechanism in concert with RBFOX3.

Abstract: Summary
Pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) have dismal cure rates, and effective therapy is urgently needed. The oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) is highly expressed in RMS and lowly expressed in healthy tissues. Here, we describe a second-generation FGFR4-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), based on an anti-human FGFR4-specific murine monoclonal antibody 3A11, as an adoptive T cell treatment for RMS. The 3A11 CAR T cells induced robust cytokine production and cytotoxicity against RMS cell lines in vitro. In contrast, a panel of healthy human primary cells failed to activate 3A11 CAR T cells, confirming the selectivity of 3A11 CAR T cells against tumors with high FGFR4 expression. Finally, we demonstrate that 3A11 CAR T cells are persistent in vivo and can effectively eliminate RMS tumors in two metastatic and two orthotopic models. Therefore, our study credentials CAR T cell therapy targeting FGFR4 to treat patients with RMS.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy currently evaluated in several clinical trials. We here report that anti-obesogenic and anti-inflammatory functions of A2AR, however, significantly restrain hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Adora2a deletion in mice triggers obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and systemic inflammation, leading to spontaneous HCC and promoting dimethylbenzyl-anthracene (DMBA)- or diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC. Conditional Adora2a deletion reveals critical roles of myeloid and hepatocyte-derived A2AR signaling in restraining HCC by limiting hepatic inflammation and steatosis. Remarkably, the impact of A2AR pharmacological blockade on HCC development is dependent on pre-existing NASH. In support of our animal studies, low ADORA2A gene expression in human HCC is associated with cirrhosis, hepatic inflammation, and poor survival. Together, our study uncovers a previously unappreciated tumor-suppressive function for A2AR in the liver and suggests caution in the use of A2AR antagonists in patients with NASH and NASH-associated HCC.

Abstract: Breast carcinoma (BC) is one of the most common malignant cancers in females, and metastasis remains the leading cause of death in these patients. Chemotaxis plays an important role in cancer cell metastasis and the mechanism of breast cancer chemotaxis has become a central issue in contemporary research. PKCζ, a member of the atypical PKC family, has been reported to be an essential component of the EGF-stimulated chemotactic signaling pathway. However, the molecular mechanism through which PKCζ regulates chemotaxis remains unclear. Here, we used a proteomic approach to identify PKCζ-interacting proteins in breast cancer cells and identified VASP as a potential binding partner. Intriguingly, stimulation with EGF enhanced this interaction and induced the translocalization of PKCζ and VASP to the cell membrane. Further experiments showed that PKCζ catalyzes the phosphorylation of VASP at Ser157, which is critical for the biological function of VASP in regulating chemotaxis and actin polymerization in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, in PKCζ knockdown BC cells, the enrichment of VASP at the leading edge was reduced, and its interaction with profilin1 was attenuated, thereby reducing the chemotaxis and overall motility of breast cancer cells after EGF treatment. In functional assays, PKCζ promoted chemotaxis and motility of BC cells through VASP. Our findings demonstrate that PKCζ, a new kinase of VASP, plays an important role in promoting breast cancer metastasis and provides a theoretical basis for expanding new approaches to tumor biotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 persists indefinitely in people living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART). If ART is stopped, the virus rapidly rebounds from long-lived latently infected cells. Using a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection and CD4+ T cells from PLWH on ART, we investigate whether antagonizing host pro-survival proteins can prime latent cells to die and facilitate HIV-1 clearance. Venetoclax, a pro-apoptotic inhibitor of Bcl-2, depletes total and intact HIV-1 DNA in CD4+ T cells from PLWH ex vivo. This venetoclax-sensitive population is enriched for cells with transcriptionally higher levels of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins. Furthermore, venetoclax delays viral rebound in a mouse model of persistent HIV-1 infection, and the combination of venetoclax with the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 achieves a longer delay in rebound compared with either intervention alone. Thus, selective inhibition of pro-survival proteins can induce death of HIV-1-infected cells that persist on ART, extending time to viral rebound.

Abstract: Summary
Adult neurogenesis occurs in the mammalian olfactory epithelium to maintain populations of neurons that are vulnerable to injury yet essential for olfaction. Multipotent olfactory basal stem cells are activated by damage, although mechanisms regulating lineage decisions are not understood. Using mouse lesion models, we focused on defining the role of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) in olfactory neurogenesis. PRC2 has a well-established role in developing tissues, orchestrating transcriptional programs via chromatin modification. PRC2 proteins are expressed in olfactory globose basal cells (GBCs) and nascent neurons. Conditional PRC2 loss perturbs lesion-induced neuron production, accompanied by altered histone modifications and misexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors in GBCs. De-repression of Sox9 in PRC2-mutant GBCs is accompanied by increased Bowman’s gland production, defining an unrecognized role for PRC2 in regulating gland versus neuron cell fate. Our findings support a model for PRC2-dependent mechanisms promoting sensory neuronal differentiation in an adult neurogenic niche.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression dynamics provide directional information for trajectory inference from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Traditional approaches compute RNA velocity using strict modeling assumptions about transcription and splicing of RNA. This can fail in scenarios where multiple lineages have distinct gene dynamics or where rates of transcription and splicing are time dependent. We present “LatentVelo,” an approach to compute a low-dimensional representation of gene dynamics with deep learning. LatentVelo embeds cells into a latent space with a variational autoencoder and models differentiation dynamics on this “dynamics-based” latent space with neural ordinary differential equations. LatentVelo infers a latent regulatory state that controls the dynamics of an individual cell to model multiple lineages. LatentVelo can predict latent trajectories, describing the inferred developmental path for individual cells rather than just local RNA velocity vectors. The dynamics-based embedding batch corrects cell states and velocities, outperforming comparable autoencoder batch correction methods that do not consider gene expression dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for rectal cancer (RC) shows promising clinical response. The modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by NAC and its association with therapeutic response remain unclear. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome sequencing to examine the cell dynamics in 29 patients with RC, who are sampled pairwise before and after treatment. We construct a high-resolution cellular dynamic landscape remodeled by NAC and their associations with therapeutic response. NAC markedly reshapes the populations of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which is strongly associated with therapeutic response. The remodeled CAF subsets regulate the TME through spatial recruitment and crosstalk to activate immunity and suppress tumor progression through multiple cytokines, including CXCL12, SLIT2, and DCN. In contrast, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of malignant cells is upregulated by CAF_FAP through MIR4435-2HG induction, resulting in worse outcomes. Our study demonstrates that NAC inhibits tumor progression and modulates the TME by remodeling CAFs.

Abstract: Due to global warming, world water bodies have higher temperatures and lower oxygen concentrations that affect aquatic species including the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. This species withstands these conditions, but the information of the physiological responses that allow them to survive are scarce. We analyzed the effects of high temperature, hypoxia, reoxygenation, and the combination of these factors on the relative expression of selected genes: HSF1, Hsp70, p53, TIGAR, HIF-1α, and VEGF1–3 in gills of L. vannamei. Additionally, glucose, lactate, NADP, and NADPH were determined. HSF1 was up-regulated in the high temperature and oxygen stress conditions, but Hsp70 was up-regulated only in reoxygenation at both temperatures. HIF-1α was also up-regulated by reoxygenation in both temperatures. Meanwhile, the VEGF genes were not altered by the stress conditions, since none of them changed expression drastically. p53 relative expression remained stable at the tested stress conditions, which prompts to the maintenance of antioxidant defenses. TIGAR expression was induced in normoxia and hypoxia at high temperature, which induced NADPH content helping to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, high temperature caused higher glucose and lactate content in normoxia and hypoxia, indicating carbohydrate mobilization and a switch to anaerobic metabolism. The results showed that HSF1, the anaerobic metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are crucial for the shrimp response to these abiotic stress conditions and contribute to their survival.

Abstract: Summary
Sequencing of genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, is recommended for individuals with a personal or family history of early onset and/or bilateral breast and/or ovarian cancer or a history of male breast cancer. Such sequencing efforts have resulted in the identification of more than 17,000 BRCA2 variants. The functional significance of most variants remains unknown; consequently, they are called variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUSs). We have previously developed mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-based assays for functional classification of BRCA2 variants. We now developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based approach for functional evaluation of BRCA2 variants using pools of mESCs expressing 10–25 BRCA2 variants from a given exon. We use this approach for functional evaluation of 223 variants listed in ClinVar. Our functional classification of BRCA2 variants is concordant with the classification reported in ClinVar or those reported by other orthogonal assays.

Abstract: It was reported that lowly expressed RING1 indicates poor prognosis in breast cancer (BC) patients, while the mechanism by which RING1 is involved in BC progression is not fully understood. Here, we found that RING1 was lowly expressed in BC tissues and cells than in normal mammary tissues and epithelial cells. Overexpression of RING1 suppressed the cell proliferative and colony formation abilities, and facilitated cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in BC cells (T47D and MCF-7 cells). Mechanistically, as an ubiquitin ligase, RING1 bound to HSF1 and induced its proteasome-dependent degradation. HSF1 could bind to the promoter region of MT2A to promote the transcriptional level of MT2A. While RING1 overexpression hindered the transcriptional activation of MT2A induced by HSF1. Moreover, ectopic expression of MT2A reversed the inhibitory effect of RING1 on cell proliferation and clonogenesis, and antagonized the promotion effect of RING1 on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in BC cells. Additionally, T47D cells infected with or without lentivirus-mediated RING1 overexpression vector (LV-RING1) were injected subcutaneously into the right back of nude mice to evaluate tumorigenicity. And overexpression of RING1 impeded the growth of BC xenografts in mice. In conclusion, RING1 suppressed the transcriptional activation of MT2A induced by HSF1 by facilitating the ubiquitination degradation of HSF1, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in BC cells.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical decision support tools can improve diagnostic performance or reduce variability, but they are also subject to post-deployment underperformance. Although using AI in an assistive setting offsets many concerns with autonomous AI in medicine, systems that present all predictions equivalently fail to protect against key AI safety concerns. We design a decision pipeline that supports the diagnostic model with an ecosystem of models, integrating disagreement prediction, clinical significance categorization, and prediction quality modeling to guide prediction presentation. We characterize disagreement using data from a deployed chest X-ray interpretation aid and compare clinician burden in this proposed pipeline to the diagnostic model in isolation. The average disagreement rate is 6.5%, and the expected burden reduction is 4.8%, even if 5% of disagreements on urgent findings receive a second read. We conclude that, in our production setting, we can adequately balance risk mitigation with clinician burden if disagreement false positives are reduced.

Abstract: Summary
Engineered cardiac tissue (ECT) using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes is a promising tool for modeling heart disease. However, tissue immaturity makes robust disease modeling difficult. Here, we established a method for modeling hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) malignant (MYH7 R719Q) and nonmalignant (MYBPC3 G115∗) pathogenic sarcomere gene mutations by accelerating ECT maturation using an ERRγ agonist, T112, and mechanical stretching. ECTs treated with T112 under 10% elongation stimulation exhibited more organized and mature characteristics. Whereas matured ECTs with the MYH7 R719Q mutation showed broad HCM phenotypes, including hypertrophy, hypercontraction, diastolic dysfunction, myofibril misalignment, fibrotic change, and glycolytic activation, matured MYBPC3 G115∗ ECTs displayed limited phenotypes, which were primarily observed only under our new maturation protocol (i.e., hypertrophy). Altogether, ERRγ activation combined with mechanical stimulation enhanced ECT maturation, leading to a more accurate manifestation of HCM phenotypes, including non-cardiomyocyte activation, consistent with clinical observations.

Abstract: Summary
Monitoring cardiac differentiation and maturation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and detecting residual undifferentiated hPSCs are indispensable for the development of cardiac regenerative therapy. MicroRNA (miRNA) is secreted from cells into the extracellular space, and its role as a biomarker is attracting attention. Here, we performed an miRNA array analysis of supernatants during the process of cardiac differentiation and maturation from hPSCs. We demonstrated that the quantification of extracellular miR-489-3p and miR-1/133a-3p levels enabled the monitoring of mesoderm and cardiac differentiation, respectively, even in clinical-grade mass culture systems. Moreover, extracellular let-7c-5p levels showed the greatest increase with cardiac maturation during long-term culture. We also verified that residual undifferentiated hPSCs in hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) were detectable by measuring miR-302b-3p expression, with a detection sensitivity of 0.01%. Collectively, we demonstrate that our method of seamlessly monitoring specific miRNAs secreted into the supernatant is non-destructive and effective for the quality evaluation of hPSC-CMs.

Abstract: Cytokinesis is the final step of the cell division in which cellular components are separated into two daughter cells. This process is regulated through the phosphorylation of different classes of proteins by serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases such as Aurora B and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Conversely, the role of phosphorylation at tyrosine residues during cytokinesis has not been studied in detail yet. In this study, we performed a phosphotyrosine proteomic analysis of cells undergoing monopolar cytokinesis synchronized by using the Eg5 inhibitor (+)-S-trityl-l-cysteine (STLC) and the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306. Phosphotyrosine proteomics gave 362 tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. Western blot analysis of proteins revealed tyrosine phosphorylation in mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), vimentin, ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2), and myelin protein zero-like protein 1 (MPZL1) during monopolar cytokinesis. Additionally, we demonstrated that EphA2, a protein with unknown function during cytokinesis, is involved in cytokinesis. EphA2 knockdown accelerated epithelial cell transforming 2 (Ect2) knockdown-induced multinucleation, suggesting that EphA2 plays a role in cytokinesis in a particular situation. The list also included many proteins previously reported to play roles during cytokinesis. These results evidence that the identified phosphopeptides facilitate the identification of novel tyrosine phosphorylation signaling involved in regulating cytokinesis.

Abstract: Summary
Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), characterized by leaky neovessels emanating from the choroid, is a main cause of blindness. As current treatments for wet AMD require regular intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) biologics, there is a need for the development of less invasive treatments. Here, we designed an allosteric inhibitor of end binding-3 (EB3) protein, termed EBIN, which reduces the effects of environmental stresses on endothelial cells by limiting pathological calcium signaling. Delivery of EBIN via eye drops in mouse and non-human primate (NHP) models of wet AMD prevents both neovascular leakage and choroidal neovascularization. EBIN reverses the epigenetic changes induced by environmental stresses, allowing an activation of a regenerative program within metabolic-active endothelial cells comprising choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesions. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of EBIN in preventing the degenerative processes underlying wet AMD.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a hypoxic and “immune-cold” tumor containing rich stromal signaling molecules and cell populations, such as proteases and immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here, we seek to profile and characterize the potential proteases that may contribute to GBM immunosuppression. Legumain (LGMN) emerges as the key protease that is highly enriched in TAMs and transcriptionally upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α). Functionally, the increased LGMN promotes TAM immunosuppressive polarization via activating the GSK-3β-STAT3 signaling pathway. Inhibition of macrophage HIF1α and LGMN reduces TAM immunosuppressive polarization, impairs tumor progression, enhances CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, and synergizes with anti-PD1 therapy in GBM mouse models. Thus, LGMN is a key molecular switch connecting two GBM hallmarks of hypoxia and immunosuppression, providing an actionable therapeutic intervention for this deadly disease.

Abstract: Summary
Radical cystectomy with preoperative cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard care for muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs). However, the complete response rate to this modality remains relatively low, and current clinicopathologic and molecular classifications are inadequate to predict NAC response in patients with MIBC. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulation of the glutathione (GSH) pathway is fundamental for MIBC NAC resistance. Comprehensive analysis of the multicohort transcriptomes reveals that GSH metabolism and immune-response genes are enriched in NAC-resistant and NAC-sensitive MIBCs, respectively. A machine-learning-based tumor/stroma classifier is applied for high-throughput digitalized immunohistochemistry analysis, finding that GSH dynamics proteins, including glutaminase-1, are associated with NAC resistance. GSH dynamics is activated in cisplatin-resistant MIBC cells, and combination treatment with a GSH dynamics modulator and cisplatin significantly suppresses tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft animal model. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the predictive and therapeutic values of GSH dynamics in determining the NAC response in MIBCs.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular indicators of long-term survival (LTS) in response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment have the potential to provide both mechanistic and therapeutic insights. In this study, we construct predictive models of LTS following ICI therapy based on data from 158 clinical trials involving 21,023 patients of 25 cancer types with available 1-year overall survival (OS) rates. We present evidence for the use of 1-year OS rate as a surrogate for LTS. Based on these and corresponding TCGA multi-omics data, total neoantigen, metabolism score, CD8+ T cell, and MHC_score were identified as predictive biomarkers. These were integrated into a Gaussian process regression model that estimates “long-term survival predictive score of immunotherapy” (iLSPS). We found that iLSPS outperformed the predictive capabilities of individual biomarkers and successfully predicted LTS of patient groups with melanoma and lung cancer. Our study explores the feasibility of modeling LTS based on multi-omics indicators and machine-learning methods.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of liver cancer, in which CD44 isoforms have been proposed as markers to identify cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, it is unclear what characteristics are associated with CSCs that exclusively express CD44 isoforms. The objective of the present study was to determine the expression of CD44 isoforms and their properties in CSCs. Analysis of transcriptomic data from HCC patient samples identified CD44v8-10 as a potential marker in HCC. In SNU-423 cells, CD44 expression was detected in over 99% of cells, and two CD44 isoforms, namely, CD44std and CD44v9, were identified in this cell line. CD44 subpopulations, including both CD44v9+ (CD44v9) and CD44v9- (CD44std) cells, were obtained by purification using a magnetic cell separation kit for human CD44v9+ cancer stem cells. CD44v9 cells showed greater potential for colony and spheroid formation, whereas CD44std cells demonstrated significant migration and invasion capabilities. These findings suggested that CD44std and CD44v9 may be used to identify features in CSC populations and provide insights into their roles in HCC.

Abstract: Summary
RAF dimer inhibitors offer therapeutic potential in RAF- and RAS-driven cancers. The utility of such drugs is predicated on their capacity to occupy both RAF protomers in the RAS-RAF signaling complex. Here we describe a method to conditionally quantify drug-target occupancy at selected RAF protomers within an active RAS-RAF complex in cells. RAF target engagement can be measured in the presence or absence of any mutant KRAS allele, enabling the high-affinity state of RAF dimer inhibitors to be quantified in the cellular milieu. The intracellular protomer selectivity of clinical-stage type II RAF inhibitors revealed that ARAF protomer engagement, but not engagement of BRAF or CRAF, is commensurate with inhibition of MAPK signaling in various mutant RAS cell lines. Our results support a fundamental role for ARAF in mutant RAS signaling and reveal poor ARAF protomer vulnerability for a cohort of RAF inhibitors undergoing clinical evaluation.

Abstract: Summary
Previous chemotherapy research has focused almost exclusively on apoptosis. Here, a standard frontline drug combination of cytarabine and idarubicin induces distinct features of caspase-independent, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1)-mediated programmed cell death “parthanatos” in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines (n = 3/10 tested), peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy human donors (n = 10/10 tested), and primary cell samples from patients with AML (n = 18/39 tested, French-American-British subtypes M4 and M5). A 3-fold improvement in survival rates is observed in the parthanatos-positive versus -negative patient groups (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28–0.37, p = 0.002–0.046). Manipulation of PARP-1 activity in parthanatos-competent cells reveals higher drug sensitivity in cells that have basal PARP-1 levels as compared with those subjected to PARP-1 overexpression or suppression. The same trends are observed in RNA expression databases and support the conclusion that PARP-1 can have optimal levels for favorable chemotherapeutic responses.

Abstract: Carcinogenesis and colorectal cancer (CRC) development are associated with dysregulation of various pathways, including Wnt and p53. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a common chemotherapeutic agent for CRC treatment, but its efficacy is restricted by drug resistance. Doxycycline is an orally active tetracycline antibiotic known for its antimicrobial and anticancer cell proliferation activities. This study intends to delineate the potential role of bioinformatically predicted ZNF24 in the 5-FU resistance of CRC cells. The expression of ZNF24 was measured in clinically collected CRC tissues and cells. Afterward, ectopic ZNF24 expression was induced by DOX to evaluate the viability, colony-forming ability and sphere-forming ability of CRC cells. It was found that ZNF24 was validated to be poorly expressed in CRC tissues, and ectopic expression of ZNF24 was revealed to restrict the malignant phenotypes of CRC cells. In addition, restored ZNF24 attenuated 5-FU resistance of CRC cells by inhibiting the Wnt pathway and activating p53 signaling. Furthermore, an inhibitor of Wnt production 2 (IWP-2) treatment was an alternative to ZNF24 up-regulation in sensitizing CRC cells to 5-FU treatment. In conclusion, our results indicate that ZNF24 inhibits 5-FU resistance of CRC cells by suppressing the Wnt pathway and activating p53 signaling, which offers a potential strategy for managing chemoresistance in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Immunophenotyping of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for enhancing immunotherapy efficacy. However, strategies for characterizing the TME exhibit significant heterogeneity. Here, we show that endoplasmic reticular oxidoreductase-1α (ERO1A) mediates an immune-suppressive TME and attenuates the response to PD-1 blockade. Ablation of ERO1A in tumor cells substantially incites anti-tumor T cell immunity and promotes the efficacy of aPD-1 in therapeutic models. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses confirm that ERO1A correlates with immunosuppression and dysfunction of CD8+ T cells along anti-PD-1 treatment. In human lung cancer, high ERO1A expression is associated with a higher risk of recurrence following neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Mechanistically, ERO1A ablation impairs the balance between IRE1α and PERK signaling activities and induces lethal unfolded protein responses in tumor cells undergoing endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity via immunogenic cell death. These findings reveal how tumor ERO1A induces immunosuppression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is an autosomal recessive monogenic disorder caused by mutations in SLC22A5. This gene encodes for OCTN2, which transports the essential metabolite carnitine into the cell. PCD patients suffer from muscular weakness and dilated cardiomyopathy. Two OCTN2-defective human induced pluripotent stem cell lines were generated, carrying a full OCTN2 knockout and a homozygous OCTN2 (N32S) loss-of-function mutation. OCTN2-defective genotypes showed lower force development and resting length in engineered heart tissue format compared with isogenic control. Force was sensitive to fatty acid-based media and associated with lipid accumulation, mitochondrial alteration, higher glucose uptake, and metabolic remodeling, replicating findings in animal models. The concordant results of OCTN2 (N32S) and -knockout emphasizes the relevance of OCTN2 for these findings. Importantly, genome-wide analysis and pharmacological inhibitor experiments identified ferroptosis, an iron- and lipid-dependent cell death pathway associated with fibroblast activation as a novel PCD cardiomyopathy disease mechanism.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a persistent inflammatory state that contributes significantly to cardiovascular disease, a primary cause of mortality worldwide. Enhanced lipid uptake by macrophages and their transformation into foam cells play a key role in the development of atherosclerosis. Recent studies using in vivo mouse models indicated that activation of AMPK has anti-atherosclerotic effects by upregulating the expression of cholesterol efflux transporters in foam cells and promoting cholesterol efflux. However, the pathway downstream of AMPK that contributes to elevated expression of cholesterol efflux transporters remains unclear. In this study, we found that activation of AMPK by AICAR and metformin inhibits foam cell formation via suppression of mTOR in macrophages. Specifically, activation of AMPK indirectly reduced the phosphorylation level of mTOR at Ser2448 and promoted the expression of cholesterol efflux transporters and cholesterol efflux. These inhibitory effects on foam cell formation were counteracted by mTOR activators. Metformin, a more nonspecific AMPK activator than AICAR, appears to inhibit foam cell formation via anti-inflammatory effects in addition to suppression of the mTOR pathway. The results of this study suggest that the development of new drugs targeting AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition may lead to beneficial results in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Conditions that cause proteotoxicity like high temperature trigger the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR). The cytosolic (CPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR rely on heat stress transcription factor (HSF) and two members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) gene family, respectively. In tomato, HsfA1a is the master regulator of CPR. Here, we identified the core players of tomato ER-UPR including the two central transcriptional regulators, namely bZIP28 and bZIP60. Interestingly, the induction of ER-UPR genes and the activation of bZIP60 are altered in transgenic plants where HsfA1a is either overexpressed (A1aOE) or suppressed (A1CS), indicating an interplay between CPR and ER-UPR systems. Several ER-UPR genes are differentially expressed in the HsfA1a transgenic lines either exposed to heat stress or to the ER stress elicitor tunicamycin (TUN). The ectopic expression of HsfA1a is associated with higher tolerance against TUN. On the example of the ER-resident Hsp70 chaperone BIP3, we show that the presence of cis-elements required for HSF and bZIP regulation serves as a putative platform for the co-regulation of these genes by both CPR and ER-UPR mechanisms, in the case of BIP3 in a stimulatory manner under high temperatures. In addition, we show that the accumulation of HsfA1a results in higher levels of three ATG genes and a more sensitized induction of autophagy in response to ER stress which also supports the increased tolerance to ER stress of the A1aOE line. These findings provide a basis for the coordination of protein homeostasis in different cellular compartments under stress conditions.

Abstract: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of hypoxemic respiratory failure in intensive care units that has increased dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In both COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS, the pathogenesis of lung injury involves local (pulmonary) and systemic inflammation, leading to impaired gas exchange, requirement for mechanical ventilation, and a high risk of mortality. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is a chaperone protein expressed in times of cell stress with roles in modulation of systemic inflammation via the NF-κB pathway. Given its important role as a modulator of inflammation, we sought to investigate the role of HSP27 and its associated auto-antibodies in ARDS caused by both SARS-CoV-2 and non-COVID etiologies. A total of 68 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation were enrolled in a prospective, observational study that included 22 non-COVID-19 and 46 COVID-19 patients. Blood plasma levels of HSP27, anti-HSP27 auto-antibody (AAB), and cytokine profiles were measured on days 1 and 3 of ICU admission along with clinical outcome measures. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS displayed significantly higher levels of HSP27 in plasma, and a higher ratio of HSP27:AAB on both day 1 and day 3 of ICU admission. In patients with COVID-19, higher levels of circulating HSP27 and HSP27:AAB ratio were associated with a more severe systemic inflammatory response and adverse clinical outcomes including more severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. These findings implicate HSP27 as a marker of advanced pathogenesis of disease contributing to the dysregulated systemic inflammation and worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 ARDS, and therefore may represent a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence implicates microbiome involvement in the development of pancreatic cancer (PaCa). Here, we investigate whether increases in circulating microbial-related metabolites associate with PaCa risk by applying metabolomics profiling to 172 sera collected within 5 years prior to PaCa diagnosis and 863 matched non-subject sera from participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cohort. We develop a three-marker microbial-related metabolite panel to assess 5-year risk of PaCa. The addition of five non-microbial metabolites further improves 5-year risk prediction of PaCa. The combined metabolite panel complements CA19-9, and individuals with a combined metabolite panel + CA19-9 score in the top 2.5th percentile have absolute 5-year risk estimates of >13%. The risk prediction model based on circulating microbial and non-microbial metabolites provides a potential tool to identify individuals at high risk of PaCa that would benefit from surveillance and/or from potential cancer interception strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic diseases call for routine management of frequent monitoring of specific biomarkers. Traditional in vitro diagnostics technologies suffer from complex sampling processes and long detection intervals, which cannot meet the need of continuous monitoring. Wearable devices taking advantage of compact size, rapid detection process, and small sample consumption are promising to take the place of endpoint detection, providing more comprehensive information about human health. Here, we proposed a fully integrated wearable system with an ultrasensitive 3D-structured biosensor for real-time monitoring of multiple metabolites. The 3D-structured biosensor shows wide linear ranges of 400–1,400 μM and 0.1–8 mM and high sensitivities of 460.5 and 283.09 μA/(mM·cm2) for lactate and glucose detection, respectively. We have conducted in vivo animal experiments, and the proposed wearable biosensor demonstrated high consistency with established methods. We envision that this system could provide a real-time wearable detection platform for multiple biomarker detection.

Abstract: Summary
Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is a powerful technique capable of detecting over 30 markers on a single slide. It has been increasingly used for single-cell-based spatial phenotyping in a wide range of samples. However, it only acquires a rectangle field of view (FOV) with a relatively small size and low image resolution, which hinders downstream analysis. Here, we reported a highly practical dual-modality imaging method that combines high-resolution immunofluorescence (IF) and high-dimensional IMC on the same tissue slide. Our computational pipeline uses the whole-slide image (WSI) of IF as a spatial reference and integrates small-FOV IMC into a WSI of IMC. The high-resolution IF images enable accurate single-cell segmentation to extract robust high-dimensional IMC features for downstream analysis. We applied this method in esophageal adenocarcinoma of different stages, identified the single-cell pathology landscape via reconstruction of WSI IMC images, and demonstrated the advantage of the dual-modality imaging strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection induces immunological dysfunction, which limits the elimination of HIV-infected cells during treated infection. Identifying and targeting dysfunctional immune cells might help accelerate the purging of the persistent viral reservoir. Here, we show that chronic HIV infection increases natural killer (NK) cell populations expressing the negative immune regulator KLRG1, both in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) does not reestablish these functionally impaired NK populations, and the expression of KLRG1 correlates with active HIV transcription. Targeting KLRG1 with specific antibodies significantly restores the capacity of NK cells to kill HIV-infected cells, reactivates latent HIV present in CD4+ T cells co-expressing KLRG1, and reduces the intact HIV genomes in samples from ART-treated individuals. Our data support the potential use of immunotherapy against the KLRG1 receptor to impact the viral reservoir during HIV persistence.

Abstract: Summary
The small-molecule drug ralimetinib was developed as an inhibitor of the p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase, and it has advanced to phase 2 clinical trials in oncology. Here, we demonstrate that ralimetinib resembles EGFR-targeting drugs in pharmacogenomic profiling experiments and that ralimetinib inhibits EGFR kinase activity in vitro and in cellulo. While ralimetinib sensitivity is unaffected by deletion of the genes encoding p38α and p38β, its effects are blocked by expression of the EGFR-T790M gatekeeper mutation. Finally, we solved the cocrystal structure of ralimetinib bound to EGFR, providing further evidence that this drug functions as an ATP-competitive EGFR inhibitor. We conclude that, though ralimetinib is >30-fold less potent against EGFR compared to p38α, its ability to inhibit EGFR drives its primary anticancer effects. Our results call into question the value of p38α as an anticancer target, and we describe a multi-modal approach that can be used to uncover a drug’s mechanism-of-action.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of cysteines with high oxidation susceptibility is important for understanding redox-mediated biological processes. In this report, we report a chemical proteomic strategy that finds cysteines with high susceptibility to S-glutathionylation. Our proteomic strategy, named clickable glutathione-based isotope-coded affinity tag (G-ICAT), identified 1,518 glutathionylated cysteines while determining their relative levels of glutathionylated and reduced forms upon adding hydrogen peroxide. Among identified cysteines, we demonstrated that CTNND1 (p120) C692 has high susceptibility to glutathionylation. Also, p120 wild type (WT), compared to C692S, induces its dissociation from E-cadherin under oxidative stress, such as glucose depletion. p120 and E-cadherin dissociation correlated with E-cadherin destabilization via its proteasomal degradation. Lastly, we showed that p120 WT, compared to C692S, increases migration and invasion of MCF7 cells under glucose depletion, supporting a model that p120 C692 glutathionylation increases cell migration and invasion by destabilization of E-cadherin, a core player in cell-cell adhesion.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial biogenesis initiates within hours of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement and is critical for T cell activation, function, and survival; yet, how metabolic programs support mitochondrial biogenesis during TCR signaling is not fully understood. Here, we performed a multiplexed metabolic chemical screen in CD4+ T lymphocytes to identify modulators of metabolism that impact mitochondrial mass during early T cell activation. Treatment of T cells with pyrvinium pamoate early during their activation blocks an increase in mitochondrial mass and results in reduced proliferation, skewed CD4+ T cell differentiation, and reduced cytokine production. Furthermore, administration of pyrvinium pamoate at the time of induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental model of multiple sclerosis in mice, prevented the onset of clinical disease. Thus, modulation of mitochondrial biogenesis may provide a therapeutic strategy for modulating T cell immune responses.

Abstract: Angelicin has been reported to have antitumor effects on many types of cancer. However, few studies on angelicin in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have been performed. We performed cell cycle and apoptosis analyses to assess the effect of angelicin on OSCC cells. We conducted RNA-seq studies to reveal differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) and c-MYC were strongly down-regulated differential genes. Silencing RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown DUSP6. The mouse xenograft model was used to mimic OSCC. Angelicin inhibited OSCC in vitro. We found that DUSP6 interacted with c-MYC. DUSP6 knockdown group and DUSP6 knockdown + angelicin group had similar effects of OSCC cells. Angelicin could reduce tumor formation, DUSP6, and c-MYC expression in vivo. Compared with paclitaxel, the tumor inhibition effect of the two drugs was similar. However, angelicin did not cause weight loss and had lower toxicity. In sum, Angelicin has antitumor effects on OSCC in vitro and vivo by negatively regulating the DUSP6 mediated c-MYC signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Ischemic retinal diseases (IRDs) are a series of common blinding diseases that depend on accurate fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) image interpretation for diagnosis and treatment. An artificial intelligence system (Ai-Doctor) was developed to interpret FFA images. Ai-Doctor performed well in image phase identification (area under the curve [AUC], 0.991–0.999, range), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) diagnosis (AUC, 0.979–0.992), and non-perfusion area segmentation (Dice similarity coefficient [DSC], 89.7%–90.1%) and quantification. The segmentation model was expanded to unencountered IRDs (central RVO and retinal vasculitis), with DSCs of 89.2% and 83.6%, respectively. A clinically applicable ischemia index (CAII) was proposed to evaluate ischemic degree; patients with CAII values exceeding 0.17 in BRVO and 0.08 in DR may be associated with increased possibility for laser therapy. Ai-Doctor is expected to achieve accurate FFA image interpretation for IRDs, potentially reducing the reliance on retinal specialists.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we present a standardized, “off-the-shelf” proteomics pipeline working in a single 96-well plate to achieve deep coverage of cellular proteomes with high throughput and scalability. This integrated pipeline streamlines a fully automated sample preparation platform, a data-independent acquisition (DIA) coupled with high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometer (FAIMS) interface, and an optimized library-free DIA database search strategy. Our systematic evaluation of FAIMS-DIA showing single compensation voltage (CV) at −35 V not only yields the deepest proteome coverage but also best correlates with DIA without FAIMS. Our in-depth comparison of direct-DIA database search engines shows that Spectronaut outperforms others, providing the highest quantifiable proteins. Next, we apply three common DIA strategies in characterizing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and show single-shot mass spectrometry (MS) using single-CV (−35 V)-FAIMS-DIA results in >9,000 quantifiable proteins with <10% missing values, as well as superior reproducibility and accuracy compared with other existing DIA methods.

Abstract: Background
Breast cancer (BC) is a prevalent malignancy affecting women, characterized by a substantial occurrence rate. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is a crucial regulator of ferroptosis and has been associated with promoting cell growth and invasion in different types of human cancers. This study aimed to investigate the functional significance of SQLE in BC and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms involved.
Methods
SQLE expression levels in BC tissues were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Cell viability, invasion, migration, and cell cycle distribution were assessed using a combination of assays, including the Cell Counting Kit-8, EdU, colony formation, Transwell, and wound healing assays and flow cytometry analysis. Measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde assay, and glutathione assay were utilized to investigate ferroptosis. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to explore the correlation between SQLE and CCNB1. The in vivo tumor growth was evaluated by conducting a xenograft tumorigenicity assay to investigate the impact of SQLE.

SQLE expression was significantly increased in BC, and higher SQLE expression levels were significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis. In vitro functional assays revealed that the overexpression of SQLE markedly enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities of BC cells. Furthermore, SQLE overexpression facilitated tumor growth in nude mice. Mechanistically, SQLE alleviated the ubiquitination modification of CCNB1, leading to enhanced stability of the CCNB1 protein and decreased intracellular ROS levels. Ultimately, this inhibited ferroptosis and facilitated the progression of BC. Our findings have provided insights into a crucial pathway by which elevated SQLE expression confers protection to BC cells against ferroptosis, thus promoting cancer progression. SQLE may serve as a novel oncological marker and a potential therapeutic target for BC progression.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that SQLE plays a regulatory role in BC progression by modulating CCNB1 and ferroptosis. These findings offer valuable insights into the role of SQLE in the pathogenesis of BC and demonstrate its potential as a therapeutic target for treating BC.

Abstract: Summary
Intercellular cytoplasmic material transfer (MT) occurs between transplanted and developing photoreceptors and ambiguates cell origin identification in developmental, transdifferentiation, and transplantation experiments. Whether MT is a photoreceptor-specific phenomenon is unclear. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) replacement, through transdifferentiation or transplantation, holds potential for restoring vision in optic neuropathies. During careful assessment for MT following human stem cell-derived RGC transplantation into mice, we identified RGC xenografts occasionally giving rise to labeling of donor-derived cytoplasmic, nuclear, and mitochondrial proteins within recipient Müller glia. Critically, nuclear organization is distinct between human and murine retinal neurons, which enables unequivocal discrimination of donor from host cells. MT was greatly facilitated by internal limiting membrane disruption, which also augments retinal engraftment following transplantation. Our findings demonstrate that retinal MT is not unique to photoreceptors and challenge the isolated use of species-specific immunofluorescent markers for xenotransplant identification. Assessment for MT is critical when analyzing neuronal replacement interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Neurovascular dysfunction is a preclinical manifestation of diabetic complications, including diabetic retinopathy (DR). Herein, we report that a transfer RNA-derived RNA fragment, tRF-3001a, is significantly upregulated under diabetic conditions. tRF-3001a downregulation inhibits Müller cell activation, suppresses endothelial angiogenic effects, and protects against high-glucose-induced retinal ganglion cell injury in vitro. Furthermore, tRF-3001a downregulation alleviates retinal vascular dysfunction, inhibits retinal reactive gliosis, facilitates retinal ganglion cell survival, and preserves visual function and visually guided behaviors in STZ-induced diabetic mice and db/db diabetic mice. Mechanistically, tRF-3001a regulates neurovascular dysfunction in a microRNA-like mechanism by targeting GSK3B. Clinically, tRF-3001a is upregulated in aqueous humor (AH) samples of DR patients. tRF-3001a downregulation inhibits DR-induced human retinal vascular endothelial cell and Müller cell dysfunction in vitro and DR-induced retinal neurovascular dysfunction in C57BL/6J mice. Thus, targeting tRF-3001a-mediated signaling is a promising strategy for the concurrent treatment of vasculopathy and neuropathy in diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: Summary
The interleukin 6 (IL6) signaling pathway plays pleiotropic roles in regulating the inflammatory milieu that contributes to arthritis development. Here, we show that activation of IL6 trans-signaling induces phenotypic transitions in tissue-resident cells toward an inflammatory state. The establishment of arthritis increases the serum number of extracellular vesicles (EVs), while these EVs express more IL6 signal transducer (IL6ST, also known as gp130) on their surface. Transferring these EVs can block IL6 trans-signaling in vitro by acting as decoys that trap hyper IL6 and prevent inflammatory amplification in recipient arthritic mice. By genetically fusing EV-sorting domains with extracellular domains of receptors, we engineered EVs that harbor a higher quantity of signaling-incompetent decoy receptors. These exogenous decoy EVs exhibit significant potential in eliciting efficient anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Our findings suggest an inherent resistance of decoy EVs against inflammation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of efficient decoy EVs in treating inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) is an alcohol-oxidizing enzyme with poorlydefined biology. Here we report that ADH1 is highly expressed in kidneys of mice with lethal endotoxemia and is transcriptionally upregulated in tubular cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimuli through TLR4/NF-κB cascade. The Adh1 knockout (Adh1KO) mice with lethal endotoxemia displayed increased susceptibility to acute kidney injury (AKI) but not systemic inflammatory response. Adh1KO mice develop more severe tubular cell apoptosis in comparison to Adh1 wild-type (Adh1WT) mice during course of lethal endotoxemia. ADH1 deficiency facilitates the LPS-induced tubular cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ADH1 deficiency dampens tubular mitophagy that relies on PINK1-Parkin pathway characterized by the reduced membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of fragmented mtDNA to cytosol. Kidney-specific overexpression of PINK1 and Parkin by adeno-associated viral vector 9 (AAV9) delivery ameliorates AKI exacerbation in Adh1KO mice with lethal endotoxemia. Our study supports the notion that ADH1 is critical for blockade of tubular apoptosis mediated by mitophagy, allowing the rapid identification and targeting of alcohol-metabolic route applicable to septic AKI.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been associated with immune evasion and tumor progression. We show that the RNA-sensing receptor RIG-I within tumor cells governs biogenesis and immunomodulatory function of EVs. Cancer-intrinsic RIG-I activation releases EVs, which mediate dendritic cell maturation and T cell antitumor immunity, synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade. Intact RIG-I, autocrine interferon signaling, and the GTPase Rab27a in tumor cells are required for biogenesis of immunostimulatory EVs. Active intrinsic RIG-I signaling governs composition of the tumor EV RNA cargo including small non-coding stimulatory RNAs. High transcriptional activity of EV pathway genes and RIG-I in melanoma samples associate with prolonged patient survival and beneficial response to immunotherapy. EVs generated from human melanoma after RIG-I stimulation induce potent antigen-specific T cell responses. We thus define a molecular pathway that can be targeted in tumors to favorably alter EV immunomodulatory function. We propose “reprogramming” of tumor EVs as a personalized strategy for T cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
To construct a urine extracellular vesicle long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) classifier that can detect high-grade prostate cancer (PCa) of grade group 2 or greater and estimate the risk of progression during active surveillance, we identify high-grade PCa-specific lncRNAs by combined analyses of cohorts from TAHSY, TCGA, and the GEO database. We develop and validate a 3-lncRNA diagnostic model (Clnc, being made of AC015987.1, CTD-2589M5.4, RP11-363E6.3) that can detect high-grade PCa. Clnc shows higher accuracy than prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and two risk calculators (Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial [PCPT]-RC 2.0 and European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ERSPC]-RC) in the training cohort (n = 350), two independent cohorts (n = 232; n = 251), and TCGA cohort (n = 499). In the prospective active surveillance cohort (n = 182), Clnc at diagnosis remains a powerful independent predictor for overall active surveillance progression. Thus, Clnc is a potential biomarker for high-grade PCa and can also serve as a biomarker for improved selection of candidates for active surveillance.

Abstract: Summary
Fungal infections are a global threat; yet, there are no licensed vaccines to any fungal pathogens. Th17 cells mediate immunity to Candida albicans, particularly oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), but essential downstream mechanisms remain unclear. In the murine model of OPC, IκBζ (Nfkbiz, a non-canonical NF-κB transcription factor) was upregulated in an interleukin (IL)-17-dependent manner and was essential to prevent candidiasis. Deletion of Nfkbiz rendered mice highly susceptible to OPC. IκBζ was dispensable in hematopoietic cells and acted partially in the suprabasal oral epithelium to control OPC. One prominent IκBζ-dependent gene target was β-defensin 3 (BD3) (Defb3), an essential antimicrobial peptide. Human oral epithelial cells required IκBζ for IL-17-mediated induction of BD2 (DEFB4A, human ortholog of mouse Defb3) through binding to the DEFB4A promoter. Unexpectedly, IκBζ regulated the transcription factor Egr3, which was essential for C. albicans induction of BD2/DEFB4A. Accordingly, IκBζ and Egr3 comprise an antifungal signaling hub mediating mucosal defense against oral candidiasis.

Abstract: Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (HH) environment causes stress to the body, especially the oxygen-consuming organs. Chronic HH conditions have adverse effects on the myocardium. Thus, we conducted this experiment and aim to evaluate such adverse effects and explore the therapeutic role of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in rats’ heart under chronic HH conditions. For that purpose, we transported rats from plain to a real HH environment at high altitude for establishing the HH model. At high altitude, animals were treated with EGCG while the salidroside was used as the positive control. General physiological data were collected, and routine blood test results were analyzed. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was examined to assess the structural and functional changes of the heart. Serum levels of cardiac enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined. Oxidative markers in the left ventricle (LV) were detected. Additionally, ultrastructural and histopathological changes and apoptosis of the LV were assessed. Furthermore, the antioxidant stress-relevant proteins nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were detected. The experiment revealed that EGCG treatment decreased HH-induced elevation of cardiac enzymes and relieved mitochondrial damage of the LV. Notably, EGCG treatment significantly alleviated oxidative stress in the LV and inflammatory response in the blood. Western blot confirmed that EGCG significantly upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1. Therefore, EGCG may be considered a promising natural compound for treating the HH-induced myocardial injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Three-dimensional (3D) stem cell models of the ovary have the potential to benefit women’s reproductive health research. One such model, the reconstituted ovary (rOvary) self-assembles with pluripotent stem cell-derived germ cells creating a 3D ovarian mimic competent to support the differentiation of functional oocytes inside follicles. In this study, we evaluated the cellular composition of the rOvary revealing the capacity to generate multiple follicles surrounded by NR2F2+ stroma cells. However, the rOvary does not develop a surface epithelium, the source of second-wave pre-granulosa cells, or steroidogenic theca. Therefore, the rOvary models represent the self-assembly of activated follicles in a pre-pubertal ovary poised but not yet competent for hormone production.

Abstract: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with a strong correlation to intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Inflammation-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation plays a major role in IDD's progression. Emodin, known for its anti-inflammatory effects and ability to inhibit ECM degradation in osteoarthritis, but its role in IDD is unclear. Our study aimed to explore emodin's role and mechanisms on IDD both in vivo and in vitro. We discovered that emodin positively regulated anabolic markers (COL2A1, aggrecan) and negatively impacted catabolic markers (MMP3, MMP13) in nucleus pulposus cells, while also inhibiting cell apoptosis under inflammation environment. We revealed that emodin inhibits inflammation-induced NF-ĸB activation by suppressing the degradation of LRP1 via the proteasome pathway. Additionally, LRP1 was validated as essential to emodin's regulation of ECM metabolism and apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo. Ultimately, we demonstrated that emodin effectively alleviates IDD in a rat model. Our findings uncover the novel pathway of emodin inhibiting ECM degradation and apoptosis through the inhibition of NF-κB via LRP1, thus alleviating IDD. This study not only broadens our understanding of emodin's role and mechanism in IDD treatment but also guides future therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Communication between adipocytes and endothelial cells (EC) is suggested to play an important role in the metabolic function of white adipose tissue. In order to generate tools to investigate in detail the physiology and communication of EC and adipocytes, a method for isolation of adipose microvascular EC from visceral adipose tissue (VAT) biopsies of subjects with obesity was developed. Moreover, mature white adipocytes were isolated from the VAT biopsies by a method adapted from a previously published Membrane aggregate adipocytes culture (MAAC) protocol. The identity and functionality of the cultivated and isolated adipose microvascular EC (AMvEC) was validated by imaging their morphology, analyses of mRNA expression, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), immunostaining, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, and in vitro angiogenesis assays. Finally, we established a new trans filter co-culture system (membrane aggregate adipocyte and endothelial co-culture, MAAECC) for the analysis of communication between the two cell types. EC-adipocyte communication in this system was validated by omics analyses, revealing several altered proteins belonging to pathways such as metabolism, intracellular transport and signal transduction in adipocytes co-cultured with AMvEC. In reverse experiments, induction of several pathways including endothelial development and functions was found in AMvEC co-cultured with adipocytes. In conclusion, we developed a robust method to isolate EC from small quantities of human VAT. Furthermore, the MAAECC system established during the study enables one to study the communication between primary white adipocytes and EC or vice-versa and could also be employed for drug screening.

Abstract: Summary
Our understanding of how STAG proteins contribute to cell identity and disease have largely been studied from the perspective of chromosome topology and protein-coding gene expression. Here, we show that STAG1 is the dominant paralog in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and is required for pluripotency. mESCs express a wide diversity of naturally occurring Stag1 isoforms, resulting in complex regulation of both the levels of STAG paralogs and the proportion of their unique terminal ends. Skewing the balance of these isoforms impacts cell identity. We define a novel role for STAG1, in particular its N-terminus, in regulating repeat expression, nucleolar integrity, and repression of the two-cell (2C) state to maintain mESC identity. Our results move beyond protein-coding gene regulation via chromatin loops to new roles for STAG1 in nucleolar structure and function, and offer fresh perspectives on how STAG proteins, known to be cancer targets, contribute to cell identity and disease.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Dysregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HF. The present study aims to investigate the role of lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) in cardiomyocyte pyroptosis in a murine HF model. A murine HF model was established through transverse aortic contraction surgery, and an in vitro HF cell model was developed by treating HL-1 cells with H2O2. HOTAIR was overexpressed in TAC mice and HL-1 cells via pcDNA3.1-HOTAIR transfection. Cardiac function was assessed in TAC mice, and myocardial changes were evaluated using HE staining. The expression of NLRP3 was examined by immunohistochemistry. Myocardial injury markers and pyroptosis-related inflammatory cytokines were quantified using ELISA. Protein levels of NLRP3, cleaved-caspase-1, and GSDMD-N were analyzed by Western blot. Dual-luciferase assays and RNA immunoprecipitation were employed to confirm the binding interactions between HOTAIR and miR-17-5p, miR-17-5p and RORA. Functional rescue experiments were conducted by overexpressing miR-17-5p or silencing RORA in HL-1 cells. HOTAIR exhibited reduced expression in TAC mice and H2O2-induced cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of HOTAIR ameliorated cardiac dysfunction, reduced myocardial pathological injury, enhanced cardiomyocyte viability, and decreased myocardial injury and pyroptosis. HOTAIR interacted with miR-17-5p to repress RORA transcription. Overexpression of miR-17-5p or silencing of RORA abolished the inhibitory effect of HOTAIR overexpression on cardiomyocyte pyroptosis. In conclusion, HOTAIR competitively bound to miR-17-5p, relieving its inhibition of RORA transcription and leading to increased RORA expression and suppressed cardiomyocyte pyroptosis in HF models.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of vascular structures is fundamental for in vitro tissue engineering. Vascularization can enable the nutrient supply within larger structures and increase transplantation efficiency. We differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells toward endothelial cells in 3D suspension culture. To investigate in vitro neovascularization and various 3D microenvironmental approaches, we designed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic study. Time-resolved single-cell transcriptomics of the endothelial and co-evolving mural cells gave insights into cell type development, stability, and plasticity. Transfer to a 3D hydrogel microenvironment induced neovascularization and facilitated tracing of migrating, coalescing, and tubulogenic endothelial cell states. During maturation, we monitored two pericyte subtypes evolving mural cells. Profiling cell-cell interactions between pericytes and endothelial cells revealed angiogenic signals during tubulogenesis. In silico discovered ligands were tested for their capability to attract endothelial cells. Our data, analyses, and results provide an in vitro roadmap to guide vascularization in future tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Dyskinesia is involuntary movement caused by long-term medication with dopamine-related agents: the dopamine agonist 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) to treat Parkinson’s disease (L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia [LID]) or dopamine antagonists to treat schizophrenia (tardive dyskinesia [TD]). However, it remains unknown why distinct types of medications for distinct neuropsychiatric disorders induce similar involuntary movements. Here, we search for a shared structural footprint using magnetic resonance imaging-based macroscopic screening and super-resolution microscopy-based microscopic identification. We identify the enlarged axon terminals of striatal medium spiny neurons in LID and TD model mice. Striatal overexpression of the vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT) is necessary and sufficient for modeling these structural changes; VGAT levels gate the functional and behavioral alterations in dyskinesia models. Our findings indicate that lowered type 2 dopamine receptor signaling with repetitive dopamine fluctuations is a common cause of VGAT overexpression and late-onset dyskinesia formation and that reducing dopamine fluctuation rescues dyskinesia pathology via VGAT downregulation.

Serratia bacteria, commonly found in Anopheles mosquitoes, potentially mediate mosquito resistance to Plasmodium. Using S. ureilytica Su_YN1 as a model, we show that a quorum sensing (QS) circuit is crucial for stable colonization. After blood ingestion, the QS synthase SueI generates the signaling molecule N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL). Once C6-HSL binds to the QS receptor SueR, repression of the phenylalanine-to-acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) conversion pathway is lifted. This pathway regulates outer membrane vesicle (OMV) biogenesis and promotes Serratia biofilm-like aggregate formation, facilitating gut adaptation and colonization. Notably, exposing Serratia Su_YN1-carrying Anopheles mosquitoes to C6-HSL increases Serratia gut colonization and enhances Plasmodium transmission-blocking efficacy. These findings provide insights into OMV biogenesis and commensal gut colonization and identify a powerful strategy for enhancing commensal resistance to pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Mpox is caused by a zoonotic virus belonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus and the Poxviridae family. In this study, we develop a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-coupled CRISPR-Cas12a detection assay for the mpox virus. We design and test a series of CRISPR-derived RNAs(crRNAs) targeting the conserved D6R and E9L genes for orthopoxvirus and the unique N3R and N4R genes for mpox viruses. D6R crRNA-1 exhibits the most robust activity in detecting orthopoxviruses, and N4R crRNA-2 is able to distinguish the mpox virus from other orthopoxviruses. The Cas12a/crRNA assay alone presents a detection limit of 108 copies of viral DNA, whereas coupling RPA increases the detection limit to 1–10 copies. The one-tube RPA-Cas12a assay can, therefore, detect viral DNA as low as 1 copy within 30 min and holds the promise of providing point-of-care detection for mpox viral infection.
