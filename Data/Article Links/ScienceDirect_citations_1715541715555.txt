Abstract: Tungsten oxide films that have larger effective surface area or extensive grain boundaries tend to be more suitable for use in electrochromic devices. We propose in this paper a simple methodology for increasing the roughness and thus the effective surface area of WO3 films. This method is based on the tendency of the peroxytungstate precursor to form large aggregates within its solution with time. To this aim, a systematic study of the precursor aging effect on the resulting WO3 film properties was conducted. It was established that with increasing aging time of the precursor solution, more and larger aggregates are formed, which are then deposited on the film surface. The deposition of the aggregates causes the formation of large cracks on the film surface, thereby increasing its effective area. An optimum of the precursor aging time was found to be around 80h. Films prepared with such an aged solution were found to have the highest Li+ diffusion coefficient and voltammetrically intercalated charge density per unit film thickness. It was also observed that the coloration efficiency of films prepared using the aforementioned method was higher than that of equivalent electron-gun deposited films throughout the visible spectrum and especially in the near infrared. The enhanced properties of these films indicate their improved electrochromic performance, which is mainly due to their increased surface area.

Abstract: Ribosomal proteins (RPs), structural components of the ribosome involved in protein synthesis, are of significant importance in all organisms. Previous studies have suggested that some RPs may have other functions in addition to assembly of the ribosome. The small ribosomal subunits RPS7, has been reported to modulate the mdm2–p53 interaction. To further investigate the biological functions of RPS7, we used morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO) to specifically knockdown RPS7 in zebrafish. In RPS7-deficient embryos, p53 was activated, and its downstream target genes and biological events were induced, including apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Hematopoiesis was also impaired seriously in RPS7-deficient embryos, which was confirmed by the hemoglobin O-dianisidine staining of blood cells, and the expression of scl, gata1 and α-E1 globin were abnormal. The matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) family genes were also activated in RPS7 morphants, indicating that improper cell migration might also cause development defects. Furthermore, simultaneously knockdown of the p53 protein by co-injecting a p53 MO could partially reverse the abnormal phenotype in the morphants. These results strengthen the hypothesis that specific ribosomal proteins regulate p53 and that their deficiency affects hematopoiesis. Moreover, our data implicate that RPS7 is a regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) family in zebrafish system. These specific functions of RPS7 may provide helpful clues to study the roles of RPs in human disease.

Abstract: An interesting procedure to optimize organic solar cells is to lower the band gap of the polymer layer by introducing alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) units in the backbone. However, many aspects of the fundamental physics involved in this low band gap design and their relation with the solar cell performance are still unknown. In this work we address those aspects by studying electro-optical properties of the poly(9,9′-dioctyl-2,7-fluorenediylvinylene-co-2,5-thiophene) (PFTBT) copolymer, which consists of a fluorene linked by a vinylene to a donor–acceptor–donor segment (benzothiadiazole unit between 2 thiophenes groups). Using density functional theory we have performed a detailed analysis of the geometric structure, ground state electronic structure and excited state vertical transitions of the PFTBT. By comparing the results of this theoretical analysis with the solution and thin film UV–vis absorption spectra we were able to identify the main chemical units involved in the two strong transitions responsible for the PFTBT dual absorption. We have found that the absence of alkyl substitutions on the thiophene units increases the planarity of the polymer backbone leading to a thin film with a higher absorption at low wavelengths and larger hole mobility compared to an analogous copolymer. Improved photovoltaic properties of PFTBT were demonstrated by fabricating bilayer devices using C60 as acceptor. The power conversion efficiency reached 1% which is comparable to those obtained using optimized alternating copolymers in the bulk heterojunction architecture. Finally we found that the light absorption around the “blue” band has a higher efficiency on photocarrier generation because it involves the transition from a delocalized occupied state to a more localized excited state in the polymer backbone. This lower initial electron–hole spatial overlap facilitates the exciton dissociation which increases the photocurrent yield.

Abstract: Two novel trivalent metal porphyrin dyes, PMn-HT-SCN and PGa-HT-SCN, were designed, synthesized and firstly applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These two dyes possess porphyrin donor modified with manganese (III) and gallium (III) as coordination metal and NCS as the second ligand, cyanoacrylic acid as electron-accepting moiety and 4-hexylthiophene as π-spacers. Each of the porphyrin showed different adsorption behavior and saturated coverage on the TiO2 surface. Between the two dyes, the PMn-HT-SCN-based DSSCs afforded the best photovoltaic performance: a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 4.32mA/cm2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.61V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.58, corresponding to a solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 1.53% under 100mW/cm2 irradiation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the integration of an absorbing photonic crystal within a thin-film photovoltaic solar cell. Optical simulations performed on a complete solar cell revealed that patterning the hydrogenated amorphous silicon active layer as a 2D photonic crystal membrane enabled to increase its integrated absorption by 28 % between 300 and 720nm, comparing to a similar but unpatterned stack. In order to fabricate such promising cells, we developed a high throughput process based on holographic lithography and reactive ion etching. The influences of the parameters taking part in those processes on the obtained patterns are discussed. Optical measurements performed on the resulting “photonized” solar cell structures underline the regularity of the 2D pattern and a significant absorption increase above 550nm, similarly to what is observed on the simulated absorption spectra. Moreover, our patterned cells are found to be robust with regards to the angle of incidence of the light.

Abstract: Well suited and reliable values of the optical and electrical properties of thin indium tin oxide (ITO) films are needed in order to choose the optimal deposition parameters and to perform reliable modeling for solar cells design. In this work, a new method will be presented to evaluate the ITO transparency directly on silicon substrates. The effects of each deposition parameter that influences the ITO transparency and conductivity force a trade-off in the frame of values useful for SHJ solar cells. The deposition of our optimized ITO film on a textured wafer yields a weighted average reflectance as low as 4.4±0.2%. The deposition of an MgF2/ITO double-layer anti-reflection coating (DL-ARC) on textured cells increases the efficiency from 17.9%, measured immediately after contacts have been added to the ITO, to 18.4% after the MgF2 deposition. An annealing step at 200°C for 10min proved to further increase the efficiency up to 18.9%, for a total gain of 1%.

Abstract: We demonstrate semitransparent inverted polymer solar cells with highly transparent anodes. The structure of the anode is made up of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/silver (Ag)/tungsten oxide (WO3). The inner MoO3 layer is introduced as a buffer layer to improve hole collection, while the outer WO3 layer serves as a light coupling layer to enhance optical transmittance of the photovoltaic device. The dependence of device performances on thickness of the outer WO3 layer was investigated, and the transmittance and reflectance of MoO3 (1nm)/Ag(10nm)/WO3(x=0, 20, 40, 60, and 80nm) electrode are compared. A high transmission of 90% was achieved for semitransparent inverted polymer solar cells with a 40nm thick outer WO3 layer.

Abstract: Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a lymphoproliferative disorder of incompletely understood etiology and with various clinical presentations. The best therapeutic option for this disease is not well established. MCD is known to be associated with autoimmune phenomena. A 70-year-old female patient of MCD with progressive nodal disease associated with autoimmune thrombocytopenia failed steroid treatment and showed a transient response to intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient achieved complete recovery of her platelet count and a very good response in nodal disease after 3 weekly doses of anti-CD-20 antibody (rituximab). Anti-CD20 antibody treatment could be a good therapeutic option for MCD, mainly when associated with immune-related disorders.

A single lysine of the two-lysine recognition motif of the D3 domain of receptor-associated protein is sufficient to mediate endocytosis by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein,

Abstract: Ligand binding of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family is mediated by complement-type repeats (CR) each comprising a binding pocket for a single basic amino acid residue. It has been proposed that at least two CRs are required for high-affinity interaction by utilising two spatially distinct lysine residues on the ligand surface. LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) mediates the cellular uptake of a multitude of ligands, some of which bind LRP with a relatively low affinity suggesting a suboptimal positioning of the two critical lysines. We now addressed the role of the two critical lysines not only in LRP binding but also in LRP-dependent endocytosis. Variants of the third domain (D3) of receptor-associated protein (RAP) were created carrying lysine to alanine or arginine replacements at the putative contact residues K253, K256 and K270. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that replacement of K253 did not affect high-affinity LRP binding at all, whereas replacement of either K256 or K270 markedly reduced the affinity by approximately 10-fold. Binding was abolished when both lysines were replaced. Substitution by either alanine or arginine exerted an almost identical effect on LRP binding. This suggests that despite their positive charge, arginine residues do not support receptor binding at all. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry studies surprisingly revealed that the single mutants were still taken up and still competed for the uptake of full length RAP despite their receptor binding defect. We therefore propose that the presence of only one of the two critical lysines is sufficient to drive endocytosis.

Abstract: Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They share a common environmental risk factor in cigarette smoke exposure and a genetic predisposition represented by the incidence of these diseases in only a fraction of smokers. COPD is also a major independent risk factor for lung carcinoma, among long-term smokers. Smokers with COPD also have a higher risk of developing a specific histological subtype of non-small cell lung cancer termed squamous cell carcinoma. For these reasons the focus of this review is on the potential pathogenic molecular links between tobacco smoking-related COPD and squamous cell carcinoma. We believe that we need to promote more studies on the molecular and cellular pathobiology of smokers with premalignant bronchial lesions of the squamous cell lung carcinoma compared with a control group of smokers with and without COPD to unravel the complex molecular interactions between COPD and early squamous cell lung carcinoma. These studies should also look at younger healthy smokers in combination with risk models of lung cancer and COPD. Overall these studies may allow the discovery of new molecular targets of the early carcinogenesis process that in the foreseeable future may render the early diagnosis and treatment, and may be even the prevention, of invasive squamous cell lung carcinoma a reality.

Abstract: The experimental CISSY setup was constructed for the surface and interface analysis of chalcopyrite Cu(In1−xGax)(SySe1−y)2 “CIGSSe” thin-film solar cells operable as laboratory surface analysis system using commercial X-ray and UV sources or as end station at the BESSY synchrotron facility. It houses an X-ray spectrometer for X-ray emission (XES) and an electron analyzer for photoemission (PES) spectroscopy measurements. The techniques deliver information about the chemical and electronic sample structure on a complementary depth scale. With probing depths up to half a micrometer, XES provides information of the near-surface sample bulk. PES in contrast only probes the first monolayers of a sample and hence, is very surface sensitive. The special feature of the CISSY setup is the unique combination of these spectroscopies with in-system sputter and wet-chemical preparation capabilities. Furthermore, a programmable sample manipulator enables laterally resolved measurements or measurements while the sample is constantly moved, reducing damage of radiation sensitive material, as e.g. organics. This arrangement allows for the characterization of real-world sample surfaces and interfaces prepared under controlled conditions such as vacuum or inert gas. The main focus of the CISSY experiments is a better understanding of the solar cell functioning mechanisms by combining the knowledge of the chemical and electronic structures gained by spectroscopic investigation of involved components and the physical device properties. The paper will give an overview of important results from eight years of CISSY research. In that period of time CISSY has tackled three main research areas: (i) the CIGSSe absorber layer; (ii) the buffer/absorber interface; and (iii) laterally resolved and time-resolved measurements, particularly of chalcopyrite thin-film solar cell components and structures. This review will focus on some examples out of these topics including results which could only be obtained by the combination of in-system preparation and analysis capabilities as realized by the CISSY setup.

Abstract: Thin film chalcopyrite solar cells grown on light-weight, flexible substrates are an appealing product. An insulating barrier layer is a requisite for flexible steel substrates to protect the chalcopyrite absorber layer from in-diffusion of iron and also to isolate the solar module, electrically, from the metal substrate. Spray pyrolysis is presented here as a means to deposit an aluminium oxide barrier layer. Optimised spray deposition conditions are investigated and subsequent solar cell results are presented. Resistivity measurements in conjunction with thermography allow assessment of the barrier layer’s insulating properties and occurrence of pin-holes in the layer. Resulting Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells, with a barrier layer, reach an efficiency of 14.4%.

Abstract: We present the material 2,3,10,11-tetrabutyl-1,4,9,12-tetraphenyl-diindeno[1,2,3-cd:1′,2′,3′-lm] perylene (Bu4-Ph4-DIP) as alternative green donor for bulk heterojunction small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSC). It is shown that Bu4-Ph4-DIP exhibits suitable absorption characteristics to be a potential material to fill the absorption gap between the commonly used standard absorbers ZnPc and C60. Devices with bulk heterojunctions of Bu4-Ph4-DIP:C60 display very high open circuit voltages of 0.99V, high fill factors of up to 57%, and experiments yield promising efficiencies of η>2%. Such green-blue absorbing SMOSC are characterized by current voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements, and material properties are studied. It is shown that the devices are responsive to substrate heating, and that different donor–acceptor mixing ratios can increase device performance. Possible influences of mixing ratio and heating on device morphology and electrical properties are discussed.

Abstract: The performance and light-soaking behavior of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells with absorber layers deposited under non-constant silane concentration (SC) – a measure of silane dilution in hydrogen – using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are investigated. Constant SC values during deposition close to the amorphous to microcrystalline phase transition lead to the formation of crystallites after a certain thickness. To prevent this transition, SC is adjusted during growth to produce an amorphous material that is close to the microcrystalline phase transition without the inclusion of a detectable microcrystalline phase. By adjusting SC during deposition it was possible to achieve an increased open-circuit voltage that is up to 40mV higher than that for a conventional amorphous silicon solar cell at initial efficiencies above 9%. The best solar cells produced with non-constant SC show improved stability against light induced degradation, which leads to a relative loss in fill factor of only 11.4%, resulting in a stabilized fill factor of 62.5%.

Abstract: Pax3, a member of the paired class homeodomain family of transcription factors, is essential for early skeletal muscle development and is key in the development of the childhood solid muscle tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS). ARMS is primarily characterized by a t(2;13)(q35;q14) chromosomal translocation, which fuses the 5′-coding sequences of Pax3 with the 3′-coding sequence of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 generating the oncogenic fusion protein Pax3-FOXO1. We previously demonstrated that Pax3 and Pax3-FOXO1 are phosphorylated by the protein kinase CK2 at serine 205 in proliferating primary myoblasts and that this phosphorylation event is rapidly lost from Pax3, but not Pax3-FOXO1 upon the induction of differentiation. However, reports suggested that additional sites of phosphorylation might be present on Pax3. In this report we use in vitro and in vivo analyses to identify serines 201 and 209 as additional sites of phosphorylation and along with serine 205 are the only sites of phosphorylation on Pax3. We provide solid evidence supporting the role of the protein kinase GSK3β as phosphorylating Pax3 at serine 201. Using phospho-specific antibodies we demonstrate a changing pattern of phosphorylation at serines 201, 205, and 209 throughout early myogenic differentiation and that this pattern of phosphorylation is different for Pax3-FOXO1 in primary myoblasts and in several ARMS cell lines. Taken together, our results allow us to propose a molecular model to describe the changing pattern of phosphorylation for Pax3 and the altered phosphorylation for Pax3-FOXO1 during early myogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Tetraspanin CD151 mainly associates with laminin-binding integrins and forms CD151–integrin complex. We previously reported that CD151 could be a potential target for angiogenesis, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. This study investigated the role of CD151–integrin complex in angiogenesis and the signaling mechanisms involved. Here we showed that CD151 and CD151-AAA mutant were both well expressed at the protein level. CD151 gene transfer promoted angiogenesis and improved skin temperature of the lateral ischemic hindlimb, whereas CD151-AAA mutant abrogated the increase in capillary density and skin temperature. Further, CD151-AAA mutant failed to activate the FAK, ERK, PI3K/Akt/eNOS, and Rac1/Cdc42 signaling pathways. Moreover, CD151-AAA mutant was unavailable to promote bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) proliferation and migration, in contrast to the effects of CD151. The results suggested that formation of CD151–integrin complex was likely to be a prerequisite for CD151-induced angiogenesis and signaling pathways.

Abstract: We report on RISE-EWT (Rear Interdigitated Single Evaporation-Emitter Wrap-Through) solar cells on full area (12.5×12.5cm2) pseudo square boron doped Czochralski-grown silicon wafers. We investigate the main efficiency optimisation factors of these cells by investigating the dependence of RISE-EWT cell parameters on the base dopant concentration NA. We furthermore detail the effects of large feature sizes in base and emitter regions at the rear of the solar cell and investigate these effects with particular attention to the edge regions. EWT solar cells typically exhibit rather low fill factors. However, our results show that the improved fill factors can be achieved by increasing NA, which in return leads to optimised efficiency values. For our RISE-EWT solar cells made from boron doped Cz-Si wafers, this benefit is maintained even after light-induced degradation. Our investigation of edge area related effects shows the importance of proper cell design in these areas, leading to a further 2.8% absolute improvement in the fill factor. Combining increased base dopant concentration with optimised edge design, we achieve 19.0% efficiency on (12.5×12.5cm2) boron doped Cz silicon wafers before light-induced degradation, resulting in 18.1% efficiency in the light-degraded state.

Abstract: The importance of mitochondrial biogenesis in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases has been widely recognised but little is known about it with regard to NARP (Neuropathy, Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa) syndrome. Since such knowledge would contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, we designed a study to provide comprehensive overview of mitochondrial biogenesis in cybrid cells harboring NARP mutation (8993T>G). We also used Rho0 cells with the same nuclear background to show that distinct mtDNA defects lead to distinct cellular responses irrespective of nuclear genome. Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by mitochondria-to-nucleus (retrograde) communication which depends on intracellular signaling pathways sensitive to ROS. Since we previously found that selenite lowered ROS in NARP cybrids, we hypothesised that selenite could also modulate mitochondrial biogenesis in these cells. Although the mitochondrial mass was not changed in NARP cybrids, we showed the compensatory upregulation of respiratory chain subunits which prompted us to investigate the transcription factors that regulate their expression such as PGC-1α, NRFs, and TFAM. Selenite supplementation increased the level of NRF1 and nuclear accumulation of NRF2, but we did not detect any major changes in the levels of investigated respiratory chain proteins. These subtle changes in mitochondrial biogenesis in response to selenite treatment support the hypothesis that selenite could be considered as a potential therapeutic agent of NARP syndrome due to its antioxidant properties. Moreover, it could also be tested with regard to other mitochondrial disorders associated with ROS overproduction.

Abstract: We study the degradation of photovoltaic cells with poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) and (6,6)-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends under long-term continuous illumination as well as in shelf-life conditions, both in inert N2 atmosphere. Degradation of the illuminated solar cells mainly occurs by a rapid decrease of the fill factor (FF) after 300h, while short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage follow a linear decay after the initial burn-in. The sudden drop of the FF is correlated with an increase of the series resistance and proves irreversible upon annealing. Electrical measurements indicate that it stems from reduced charge extraction due to the photodegradation of the organic-electrode interfaces. Furthermore, as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum is evenly lowered over the entire wavelength range, we could exclude major changes in the blend morphology or significant changes to optical properties of the active layer. Introducing a thin C60 layer leads to complete suppression of the FF decay over 1000h, further proving that interface degradation dominates. Interestingly, similar improved lifetime over 1000h was achieved by separate substitution of MoO3 for PEDOT:PSS.

Abstract: Treatment for most patients with head and neck cancers includes ionizing radiation. A consequence of this treatment is irreversible damage to salivary glands (SGs), which is accompanied by a loss of fluid-secreting acinar-cells and a considerable decrease of saliva output. While there are currently no adequate conventional treatments for this condition, cell-based therapies are receiving increasing attention to regenerate SGs. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can differentiate into salivary epithelial cells and restore SG function in head and neck irradiated mice. BMDCs from male mice were transplanted into the tail-vein of 18Gy-irradiated female mice. Salivary output was increased in mice that received BMDCs transplantation at week 8 and 24 post-irradiation. At 24 weeks after irradiation (IR), harvested SGs (submandibular and parotid glands) of BMDC-treated mice had greater weights than those of non-treated mice. Histological analysis shows that SGs of treated mice demonstrated an increased level of tissue regenerative activity such as blood vessel formation and cell proliferation, while apoptotic activity was increased in non-transplanted mice. The expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 or c-kit) was detected in BMDC-treated SGs. Finally, we detected an increased ratio of acinar-cell area and approximately 9% of Y-chromosome-positive (donor-derived) salivary epithelial cells in BMDC-treated mice. We propose here that cell therapy using BMDCs can rescue the functional damage of irradiated SGs by direct differentiation of donor BMDCs into salivary epithelial cells.

Abstract: Te-doped CdS semiconductor films were fabricated on indium–tin–oxide (ITO) substrates by chemical bath deposition. The chemical composition, morphology, crystalline, and optical properties of the Te-doped CdS films were characterized by XPS, SEM, XRD, UV–vis, and Ellipsometer. Additionally, the carrier density and flat-band potential of the semiconductor electrodes were measured by Hall and potentiostat. Results show that the electrical property of Te-doped CdS films was changed from n-type to p-type semiconductors, when the molar ratios of Te in the bath solution were higher than 0.4. Besides, energy band-gap and carrier densities of the Te-doped samples were found in the range of 1.85–2.33eV and 9.68×1015–1.56×1017cm−3, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum photocurrent density of the samples was found to be −0.81mA/cm2 (under the external potential of −1.0V) with the largest hydrogen production capability of 1.29ml/cm2, when illuminated under a 150W Xe lamp.

A critical role for the protein phosphatase 2A B′α regulatory subunit in dephosphorylation of sphingosine kinase 1,

Abstract: Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is an important regulator of cellular signalling that has gained recent attention as a potential target for anti-cancer therapies. SK1 activity, subcellular localization and oncogenic function are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser225. ERK1/2 have been identified as the protein kinases responsible for phosphorylation and activation of SK1. Conversely, dephosphorylation and deactivation of SK1 occurs by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Active PP2A, however, is a heterotrimer, composed of tightly associated catalytic and structural subunits that can interact with an array of regulatory subunits, which are critical for determining holoenzyme substrate specificity and subcellular localization. Thus, PP2A represents a large family of holoenzyme complexes with different activities and diverse substrate specificities. To date the regulatory subunit essential for targeting PP2A to SK1 has remained undefined. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for the B′α (B56α/PR61α/PPP2R5A) regulatory subunit of PP2A in SK1 dephosphorylation. B′α was found to interact with the c-terminus of SK1, and reduce SK1 phosphorylation when overexpressed, while having no effect on upstream ERK1/2 activation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of B′α increased SK1 phosphorylation, activity and membrane localization of endogenous SK1. Furthermore, overexpression of B′α blocked agonist-induced translocation of SK1 to the plasma membrane and abrogated SK1-induced neoplastic transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Thus, the PP2A-B′α holoenzyme appears to function as an important endogenous regulator of SK1.

Abstract: The experimental U–I characteristics of a single GaSb cell, a single Si cell and their modules in a TPV system using a SiC radiator were investigated. The influence of the radiator temperature and the radiator–cell distance on the output performances of a single cell and its module was analyzed. The results demonstrate that increasing the radiator temperature or decreasing the radiator–cell distance both lead to the increasing the short-circuit current density and the output power density, but the open-circuit voltage decreases because of the rise of the cell temperature. The maximum output power densities of a single GaSb cell and the corresponding module are 0.26 and 0.28W/cm2, respectively, which are approximately 4.3 and 6.0 times that of a single Si cell and its module for a combustion power of 4.2kW and a radiator–cell distance of 1.1cm. Furthermore, a mathematical physical model was constructed to analyze the influence of the cell temperature on the output performance of the cells. For a given radiator temperature and radiator–cell distance, the theoretical results indicate that the output power density decreases with cell temperature because of attenuation of the open-circuit voltage.

Abstract: Inverted tandem organic solar cells, consisting of two bulk heterojunction sub-cells with identical poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61 (PCBM) active layer and a MoO3/Ag/Al/Ca intermediate layer, have been presented and optimized. Indium tin oxide (ITO) modified by Ca acts as a cathode for electron collection and Ag is used as the anode for hole collection for the tandem device. A proper thickness of Ca (3nm) forms a continuous layer, working as a cathode for the top sub-cell. MoO3 as the anode buffer layer prevents exciton quenching and charge loss at the anode side, which could result in increase in interfacial resistance. The variance of sub-cell thickness adjusts the optical field distribution in the entire device, facilitating light absorption and good current matching in both sub-cells. The optimal inverted tandem device achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.89% with a short-circuit current density of 4.19mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.17V, and a fill factor of 59.0% under simulated 100mW/cm2 (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation.

Abstract: 3,6-Dithiophen-2-yl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) based organic molecules and polymers have received strong attention as the donor materials of efficient organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). This paper reports the synthesis and characterization of two DPP-based organic molecules functionalized with phenanthrene and ethynylphenanthrene and their application as the donor materials of solution-processed OPVs. They have band gaps of 1.6–1.8eV and appropriate energy levels, and they can be soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran. The C≡C triple bond in ethynylphenanthrene has a strong effect on the structure and properties of molecules. It increases the rigidity of molecule, decreases the solubility in organic solvents, and increases the crystallinity of the active layer and photovoltaic performance of the OPVs. The optimal photovoltaic efficiency of OPVs with ethynylphenanthrene-functionalized DPP is 1.71% under AM 1.5G illumination (100mWcm−2), more than double of that of the OPVs with phenanthrene-functionalized DPP.

Abstract: Mammalian Ste20-like protein kinase 3 (Mst3) is a key player in inducing apoptosis in a variety of cell types and has recently been shown to participate in the signaling pathway of hypoxia-induced apoptosis of human trophoblast cell line 3A-sub-E (3A). It is believed that oxidative stress may occur during hypoxia and induce the expression of Mst3 in 3A cells via the activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1). This hypothesis was demonstrated by the suppressive effect of dl-α-lipoic acid, a reactive oxygen species scavenger, in hypoxia-induced responses of 3A cells such as Mst3 expression, nitrotyrosine formation, JNK1 activation and apoptosis. Similar results were also observed in trophoblasts of human placental explants in both immunohistochemical studies and immunoblot analyses. These suggested that the activation of Mst3 might trigger the apoptotic process in trophoblasts by activating caspase 3 and possibly other apoptotic pathways. The role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) in hypoxia-induced Mst3 up-regulation was also demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of NG-nitro-l-arginine and apocynin, which inhibits NOS and NOX, respectively. Oxidative stress was postulated to be induced by NOS and NOX in 3A cells during hypoxia. In conclusion, hypoxia induces oxidative stress in human trophoblasts by activating NOS and NOX. Subsequently, Mst3 is up-regulated and plays an important role in hypoxia-induced apoptosis of human trophoblasts.

Abstract: The durability of Fresnel lenses used in the concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) application is reviewed from the literature. The examination here primarily concerns monolithic lenses constructed of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), with supplemental examination of silicone-on-glass (SOG) composite lenses. For PMMA, the review includes the topics of: optical durability (loss of transmittance with age); discoloration (the wavelength-specific loss of transmittance); microcrazing and hazing; fracture and mechanical fatigue; physical aging, creep, shape change, buckling, and warping; and solid erosion. Soiling, or the accumulation of particulate matter, is examined in the following contexts: its magnitude of reduction in transmittance; variation with time, module tilt, and wavelength; the processes of adhesion and accumulation; particle size, distribution, composition, and morphology; and its prevention. Photodegradation and thermal decomposition, mechanisms enabling aging, are examined relative to the CPV-specific environment. Aspects specific to SOG lenses include: solarization of the glass superstrate; corrosion of glass; delamination of the silicone/glass interface; change in focus due to thermal misfit between the laminate layers; and the chemical stability of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Recommendations for future research are provided, based on the most important and the least explored topics.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The presentation time of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are not well described because of the limited number of cases occurring at each center and lack of a reliable and unequivocal classification together with the absence of multi-institutional prospective studies. We gathered information on the histopathological and clinical features and prognosis of the disease in a very large number of heart and lung transplant recipients, with data from 27 previous reports, with an emphasis of time of presentation.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective analysis of data for individual patients from published studies, entered into a database and reanalyzed.
METHODS
A comprehensive review of the literature by PubMed and Google Scholar was performed to find all data available reports on PTLD after heart and lung transplantation.
RESULTS
Data from 288 PTLD patients after heart or lung transplantation from 27 reports were entered into analysis. Heart and lung recipients with early-onset PTLD compared with late-onset PTLD were significantly more likely to be of the B cell type (100% vs. 89.8%, respectively; P=.05). PTLD in patients with early onset was less likely to involve the skin (P=.05) and spleen (P=.015), but more frequently complications of the respiratory tract (P=.002). Morphology of PTLD lesions was significantly different between the two groups with a priority for late-onset PTLD to represent non-Hodgkin lesions (P=.009). No difference was found between the two groups in survival (P=.237). One and five-year survival rates for early-onset PTLD patients were 65% and 46%, respectively; compared to 53% and 41%, respectively, for the late-onset PTLD.
CONCLUSION
Due to a higher incidence of respiratory tract involvement in the early-onset PTLD patients and skin and spleen involvement in late-onset PTLD, we suggest that all heart/lung graft recipients should be evaluated for potential multiorgan disease based early or late presentation. Further multi-institutional prospective studies are needed to confirm our results.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the electronic surface properties of polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin films by locally resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). From current imaging tunneling spectroscopy (CITS) maps of an area of (2×2)μm2 we observe distinct granular inhomogeneities, where current–voltage (I(U)) spectra differ from grain to grain and vary between metallic and semiconducting characteristics. Due to the high density of defect states at the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface, the metallic I(U) characteristics is not surprising. In the case of the semiconducting I(U) characteristics, we suggest a preferential oxidation of particular grains, which passivates defect levels at the surface. This is supported by the presence of gallium and indium oxides detected by global X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, we recorded I(U) spectra from different grains under supra band gap laser illumination, which always show semiconducting characteristics. This behavior can be explained by a saturated occupation of defect states by photoexcited charge carriers. By evaluating differential conductance (dI/dU) spectra under illumination from various grains, we estimate the average surface band gap to (1.4±0.2)eV and compare the valence band onset with results from macroscopic ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The high lateral resolution of our CITS data allows also to study electronic properties at grain boundaries, which are discussed with regard to a recent STS study on a non-oxidized sample.

Abstract: Autophagy, a major degradative pathway of the lysosomal system, has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. During autophagic process, organelles and proteins are encapsulated in double-membrane vacuoles called autophagosomes, which finally fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes where incorporated materials are degraded. Despite extensive investigations in identifying the molecular components that participate in autophagy, little is known about routes and dynamics of autophagosomes/autolysosomes in the neurites of live cells. Hence, in the present study, we aim to investigate the biophysical characteristics of neuritic transport of autolysosomes in PC12 cells. Our study demonstrated that monomeric red fluorescence protein-light chain 3 (mRFP-LC3)-labeled autolysosomes were motile and moved along PC12 neurites in both anterograde and retrograde directions with a bias towards the nucleus during starvation. By using image processing, quantitative analysis was made to show the dynamic biophysical characteristics of these vesicles. The average velocity of anterograde and retrograde transport was 0.33±0.04μm/s and 0.39±0.05μm/s, respectively. Disruption of microtubules by nocodazole completely abolished their movements, suggesting the neuritic transport of autolysosomes depends on microtubules. The directional transport of autolysosomes was also affected by blockage of motor protein activity. Altogether, our study documents many aspects of the highly dynamic movement of autolysosome in PC12 neurites. Autolysosomes transported in a bi-directional manner along microtubules by dynein and kinesin motor proteins. These findings provide valuable insight into understanding the mechanism and control of autophagy in neurites under physiological and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Si doped zinc oxide (SZO, Si 3%) thin films are grown at low substrate temperature (T≤150°C) under oxygen atmosphere, using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Si addition leads to film amorphization and higher densification. Hall effect measurements indicate a resistivity of 7.9×10−4Ωcm for SZO thin films deposited at 100°C under optimized 1.0Pa oxygen pressure. This value is in good agreement with optical resistivity simulated from the transmittance spectra. XPS measurements suggest more than one oxygen environment, and a Si oxidation state lying in between 2 and 3 only. As a matter of fact, the values of both measured and simulated carrier numbers are smaller than the ones expected, assuming that all Si cations in the ZnO matrix are at the 4+ oxidation state. Finally, the differences in the electrical and optical properties of SZO thin films deposited both on glass and PET substrates confirm the strong dependency of the electronic properties to the film crystallinity and stoichiometry in relationship with the substrate nature.

Abstract: A simple analytical model is presented describing the quantum efficiency of cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells. This model is based on a consistent set of parameters that were extracted from electrical and optical measurements. These measurements also reveal the CdTe solar cells to mainly rely on carrier generation as well as carrier collection within the space-charge region. Recombination in this part of the cell is hence taken into account. As a result, quantum efficiency spectra can be closely fitted by an expression that includes the lifetime of the minority carriers and the width of the space-charge region as free variables. The comparison of the calculated quantum efficiency curves with the experimental ones gives fundamental insight into the specific operation of CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: The properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films deposited by sol–gel sulfurization were investigated as a function of the chemical composition of the sol–gel solutions used. The chemical composition ratio Cu/(Zn+Sn) of the sol–gel solution was varied from 0.73 to 1.00, while the ratio Zn/Sn was kept constant at 1.15. CZTS films deposited using sol–gel solutions with Cu/(Zn+Sn)<0.80 exhibited large grains. In addition, the band gaps of these Cu-poor CZTS thin films were blue shifted. Solar cells with the structure Al/ZnO:Al/CdS/CZTS/Mo/soda lime glass were fabricated under non-vacuum conditions. The solar cell with the CZTS layer deposited using the sol–gel solution with Cu/(Zn+Sn)=0.80 exhibited the highest conversion efficiency of 2.03%.

Abstract: The composition and the microstructure evolutions of CuInSe2 thin films under single-bath electrodeposition processes were investigated. It was found that the film composition was mainly determined by the [Se4+]/[Cu2+] ratios in solution, but the film microstructure is strongly dependent on the initial concentrations of Se4+, Cu2+, and In3+ precursors. Higher initial concentrations of Cu2+ and In3+ in solution are beneficial for the fabrication of compact CuInSe2 thin films with highly crystallized and large grain sized chalcopyrite phase. The microstructure evolution suggests that prior adsorption and reduction of Cu2+ ions and the formation of Cu2Se compound on the substrate can promote the nucleation, growth, and coarsening of CuInSe2 crystal to form a high quality thin film during the electrodeposition processes.

Abstract: Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), an intracellular serine/threonine kinase, is implicated in cell growth and survival, cell-cycle progression, tumor angiogenesis, and cell apoptosis. Recent studies showed that the expression and activity of ILK increased significantly in many types of solid tumors. However, the exact molecular mechanism of ILK underlie tumor has not been fully ascertained. The purpose of our study was to determine whether knockdown of ILK would inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in bladder cancer cells using a plasmid vector based small interfering RNA (siRNA). The experiments showed that knockdown of ILK could remarkably inhibit cell proliferation and growth, regulate cell cycle and induce apoptosis of bladder cancer BIU-87 and EJ cells. We demonstrated that knockdown of ILK inhibited phosphorylation of downstream signaling targets protein kinase B/Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β), and reduced expression of β-catenin in BIU-87 as well as EJ cells by Western blot and Immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, down-regulation of ILK also could increase expression of Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), an important acidic cytoplasmic protein with many functions. BALB/C nude mice injected with the BIU-87 cells transfected ILK siRNA showed a significant inhibition of the tumor growth with lighter tumor weight, lower microvessels density and higher apoptosis rate than those in the other two control groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that ILK might be involved in the development of bladder cancer, and could be served as a novel potential therapy target for human bladder cancer. Our study may be of biological and clinical importance.

Abstract: Polymer solar cells made from poly(2,6-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-N-alkyl-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole) (PDTPBT) with different side chain lengths as donors and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor were investigated. After optimization with thermal treatments, the device made from PDTPBT with a longer alkyl side chain (P1) delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.06%, which is much higher than that made from PDTPBT with a shorter side chain (0.26%). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and modeling results show that the polymer with longer side chain produces much better uniform nanostructure with less pinhole than the polymer with a short side chain, resulting in lower interfacial resistance for higher short circuit current and reduced cathode penetration into the active layer for lower charge recombination rate, and further leading to higher power conversion efficiency.

An acidic pH environment increases cell death and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in osteoblasts: The involvement of BAX Inhibitor-1,

Abstract: BAX Inhibitor-1 (BI-1), a transmembrane protein on the endoplasmic reticulum, has been studied previously in various physio/pathological conditions, but not in bone cells. In this study, using the MG63 osteoblast cell line and osteoblasts differentiated from stem cells, the role of BI-1 was studied. First, expression of BI-1 was confirmed in osteoblasts, as well as osteoclasts, in mouse tibiae bone immunohistochemistry. For evaluation of a recently published property of BI-1, an acidic pH-dependent Ca2+ channel-like effect in osteoblasts, acidic pH-associated cell death, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release were examined. In MG63 osteoblasts, acidic pH induced a pH-dependent increase in cell death and ER stress, as determined by elevated expression of GRP78, CHOP, phospho-eIF2α, IRE-1α, spliced XBP-1, and phospho-JNK. In osteoblasts, mitochondrial Ca2+ also showed a strong pH-dependent increase. BI-1 knock-down using siRNA protected cells against acidic pH, regulating mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, possibly via the acidic pH-dependent Ca2+ channel-like effect of BI-1. BI-1 knock-down also resulted in inhibition of acidic pH-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. In addition, bone marrow stem cells were differentiated into human osteoblasts, which showed increased expression of BI-1 mRNA and protein. In differentiated primary human osteoblasts, acidic pH-associated cell death, mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release were more significant than in non-differentiated stem cells. In summary, endogenous expression of BI-1 is associated with acidic pH-induced Ca2+ release, cell death, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in human osteoblasts.

Abstract: An ink-jet method for fabrication of fine and smooth front side highly conductive silver lines on crystalline Silicon substrate is described. The fabricated conductive silver lines on different substrates are characterized by means optical microscope, optical profilometers, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and electrical measurements. The coffee-ring effect is controlled by increasing the solid loading of the ink from 20W% to 40W% and printing at optimum substrate temperature (90–100°C) and optimum printing parameters. Smooth printed conductive silver lines, with line thickness ranges from 0.8∼0.9μm for single pass, are obtained. When increased substrate temperature, a significant reduction of spreading of ink was observed. And conductive silver lines obtained at optimum substrate temperature (90–100°C), free of periodic wrinkles and line bleeding, are produced. The influence of annealing temperature on line resistance, the morphology and functionality of the printed conductive silver lines is optically and electrically analyzed. To deposit thicker lines multiple passes of ink-jet printing were done on polished single crystalline silicon (sc-Si) and standard alkaline (NaOH) textured n+/p single crystalline silicon (n+/p sc-Si). Moreover, the printed conductive silver lines are characterized optically and electrically. And, promising results in terms of printed line thickness and electrical property are achieved.

Abstract: Although polymer and organic photovoltaic modules represent a promising alternative to technologies based on inorganic semiconductors in terms of versatility and cost, reliable methods to test and improve their long-term stability in end-use environments still need to be developed. To be compatible with product development cycles and time-to-market constraints, the testing should provide data quickly enough to allow for changes in formulation and/or design. Over the last decades, various established large-scale industries have been refining approaches to estimate the service life of polymer-based materials and products. State-of-the-art methodologies rely on outdoor and laboratory accelerated aging techniques that combine factors of stress in a similar way as seen in the end-use environment, though at increased levels. However, testing procedures developed by the organic electronics industry in general and OPV in particular do not systematically apply the basic principles of accelerated testing that would ensure the reproduction of failure modes seen in real life. This paper takes a close look at the crucial components of a comprehensive test program aimed at estimating the long-term durability of OPV products.

Abstract: Raman Probe Spectroscopy as a powerful tool for analyzing the degradation behavior of encapsulants in c-Si based PV modules is reported. A non-destructive and quick testing method is needed in order to follow material changes during the aging of PV modules. Two types of c-Si PV modules with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulation have been aged indoors under damp-heat conditions (85% r.h./85°C) and under combined UV/moisture conditions, respectively. The aged modules as well as a non-aged reference module for each type were analyzed by Raman Spectroscopy. The degradation of the encapsulant was observed, resulting in an increasing fluorescence background, as well as changing intensities of EVA Raman peaks. A lateral non-uniformity of the fluorescence intensity of and the EVA CH stretching vibration intensity ratios, depending on the position above the cell as well as from the aging condition, could be observed and it might be an indicator for the diffusion of water in the encapsulant.

Abstract: A lens based sunlight concentration setup was used to accelerate the degradation of semiconducting polymers. Sunlight was collected outdoor and focused into an optical fiber bundle allowing for indoor experimental work. Photo-degradation of several polymers was studied by UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy and infra-red spectroscopy. This showed that the degradation rate is significantly increased by increasing illumination intensity. Acceleration factors exceeding 100 compared to standard 1 sun illumination were observed for solar concentration of 200 suns in the case of P3HT. A comparison between infra-red spectra of MEH-PPV degraded at 1 sun intensity and at high solar concentration only showed minor deviations in degradation mechanisms. The acceleration factor was found to vary linearly with the solar concentration. Finally, a comparison of the degradation rates at 1 sun and 100 suns was carried out in a materials study employing five different conjugated polymers relevant to polymer solar cells for which acceleration factors in the range 19–55 were obtained.

Abstract: Three copolymers, PFTpBt, PFbCNTpBt, and PFC6TpBt, which are based on dioctylfluorene, dithienylbenzothiadiazole, and thiophene derivatives with different functional groups, were synthesized via a Suzuki reaction. The copolymers were characterized by NMR, GPC, TGA, UV–vis absorption, and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the copolymers exhibited good thermal stability. The optical, electrochemical, photovoltaic properties, and hole mobility of the copolymers were investigated and discussed. The polymer solar cell based on PFTpBt had the best performance, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.17% under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: We found that the efficiency of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells can be enhanced by incorporating a small amount of semiconductor FeS2 nanocrystals (NCs) into the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and (6,6)-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) based active layer. Through optical and nanoscale structure measurements, it is evident that low-cost and non-toxic FeS2 NCs in such devices can efficiently improve charge carrier transport and exciton dissociation. This simple approach for increasing the photocurrent by NCs will be useful for accelerating the development of practical applications using organic solar cells.

Abstract: We successfully synthesized a series of novel solution processible small molecules (2TAPM, 4TAPM and 2BTAPM) consisting of electron-accepting unit (2-pyran-4-ylidenemalononitrile) (PM) and electron-donating unit (Triphenylamine and different thiophene units). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement indicates that these small molecules are amorphous. UV–vis absorption spectra show that the combination of PM with moieties having gradually increased electron-donating ability results in an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, leading to an extension of the absorption spectral range and a reduction of the band gap of the molecules. Both cyclic voltammetry measurement and theoretical calculations show that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the molecules could be fine-tuned by changing the electron-donating ability of the electron-donating moieties. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecules:PC71BM/LiF/Al were fabricated by using the small molecules as donors and (6,6)-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptor. Power conversion efficiencies of 1.76% and 2.47% were achieved for the photovoltaic devices based on 2TAPM:PC71BM and 4TAPM:PC71BM under simulated air mass 1.5 global irradiation (100mW/cm2), respectively.

Abstract: Highly transparent and conducting fluorine-doped ZnO (FZO) thin films were deposited on glass substrates by pulsed laser deposition. Structural, electrical, and optical properties of the films were investigated as a function of oxygen pressure ranging from 0.01 to 0.5Pa. All the films had a highly preferential c-axis orientation. The films obtained were dense and very smooth with a typical columnar structure. A minimum resistivity of 4.83×10−4Ωcm, with a carrier concentration of 5.43×1020cm−3 and a Hall mobility of 23.8cm2V−1s−1, was obtained for FZO film prepared at the optimal oxygen pressure of 0.1Pa. The average optical transmittance in the entire visible wavelength region was higher than 90%.

Abstract: Despite the promise of thin-film Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) chalcopyrite and CdTe photovoltaic technologies with respect to reducing cost per watt of solar energy conversion, these approaches rely on elements that are either costly and/or rare in the earth's crust (e.g., In, Ga, Te) or that present toxicity issues (e.g., Cd), thereby potentially limiting these technologies in terms of future cost reduction and production growth. In order to develop a photovoltaic technology that is truly compatible with terawatt deployment, it is desirable to consider material systems that employ less toxic and lower cost elements, while maintaining the advantages of the chalcopyrite and CdTe materials with respect to appropriate direct band gap tunability over the solar spectrum, high device performance (e.g., >10% power conversion efficiency) and compatibility with low-cost manufacturing. In this review, the development of kesterite-based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells, in which the indium and gallium from CIGSSe are replaced by the readily available elements zinc and tin, will be reviewed. While vacuum-deposited devices have enabled optimization within the compositional phase space and yielded selenium-free CZTS device efficiencies of as high as 6.8%, more recently a liquid-based approach has been described that has enabled deposition of CZTSSe devices with power conversion efficiency of 9.7%, bringing the kesterite-based technology into a range of potential commercial interest. Electrical characterization studies on these high-performance CZTSSe cells reveal some of the key loss mechanisms (e.g., dominant interface recombination, high series resistance and low minority carrier lifetime) that limit the cell performance. Further elucidation of these mechanisms, as well as building an understanding of long-term device stability, are required to help propel this relatively new technology forward.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation (CYTBI) and oral busulfan plus cyclophosphamide (BUCY) are commonly used conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with leukemia. However, there is conflicting data on the superiority of one regimen over the other. Our aim was to critically appraise and synthesize available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of CYTBI compared to BUCY as a conditioning regimen.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BUCY with CYTBI.
METHODS
We did a systematic search of the indexed medical literature using appropriate keywords to identify potentially relevant articles. The primary outcome of interest was efficacy measured by overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Acute and late toxicity were secondary endpoints. Meta-analysis was attempted only on RCTs. A relative risk or risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each outcome in the meta-analysis.
RESULTS
Fifteen non-randomized comparative studies involving 6280 patients were included in a narrative review without attempting a pooled analysis, in view of the potential for significant bias. Outcome data from seven RCTs involving 730 patients randomly assigned to either CYTBI or BUCY was pooled using meta-analytic methods. CYTBI was associated with a modest but non-significant reduction in all cause mortality (RR=0.82, 95%CL: 0.64–1.05; P=.12) and relapse of leukemia (RR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.72–1.10; P=.28). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly lesser with CYTBI compared to oral BUCY (RR-0.53, 95%CI: 0.31-0.90; P=.02). The cumulative incidence of major complications was not significantly different between the two regimens, but specific complications varied according to the conditioning regimen. TBi-based regimens were associated with more severe late effects on growth and development in children.
CONCLUSION
This analysis represents the largest comparative analyses of CYTBI with BUCY as a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in the indexed medical literature. Conditioning regimen and disease (type and setting) can significantly affect outcomes. TRM is significantly lesser with CYTBI, but this does not translate into a significant survival benefit. There remain valid concerns regarding the late effects of TBI, particularly in children. Although not overly superior, the weight of evidence favors CYTBI over BUCY as a first choice-conditioning regimen in patients with leukemia.

Abstract: Hypoxia inevitably develops in rapidly growing tumors and acts as an important microenvironment that forces changes in tumor behavior. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is activated during hypoxia and promotes the progression of malignancy by stimulating angiogenesis and by augmenting the ability of tumors to survive. In aerobic conditions, HIF-1α is destabilized by the PHD prolyl-hydroxylases that target HIF-1α for proteolysis via the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) and further inactivated by the FIH asparaginyl-hydroxylase that precludes the recruitment of transcription coactivators. Although HIF-1α degradation is well understood, little is known about how its transcriptional activity increases gradually in response to decreasing oxygen. In particular, it has been questioned how FIH having a high affinity for oxygen regulates the HIF-1α activity in moderate hypoxia. We here found that the HIF-1α-FIH interaction is disrupted in 1–5% oxygen. Both in vitro and in vivo binding analyses revealed that pVHL acts as an adaptor for FIH to bind HIF-1α. Furthermore, because the pVHL–FIH interaction depends on oxygen tension, the FIH-mediated inactivation of HIF-1α can be exquisitely regulated according to the severity of hypoxia. Based on these findings, we propose that pVHL fine-tunes the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in graded oxygen tensions.

Abstract: We present an investigation into the electronic, photophysical and photovoltaic properties of a π-conjugated “double-cable” polymer based on regioregular head to tail poly(3-functionalized thiophene) with pendant anthraquinone acceptor groups (PT-AQ). This material was compared with model blends composed of a mixture of regioregular head to tail poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the polymer donor and anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid octyl ester (AQ) as a small-molecule acceptor. We find that PT-AQ shows complete quenching of fluorescence whilst the donor/acceptor blend shows residual fluorescence emission and both phase separation and crystallization of the acceptor component. The operation of the double-cable based devices is however, dominated by geminate recombination and poor charge transport and extraction. Nevertheless, we show that the PT-AQ devices have a higher efficiency than devices based on representative bulk-heterojunction AQ:P3HT blends as the very coarse phase separation and crystallization is suppressed.

Abstract: In recent years, increased attention has been focused on the use of lasers in different fabrication steps of solar cells, in particular laser doping to form emitter and/or selective emitter. In this method the laser energy is used to melt silicon, allowing the diffusion of dopant atoms to occur in the liquid phase. The main advantage of this method is the localised nature of the laser beam, which melts and diffuses a limited area without heating the bulk, therefore reducing the possible degradation associated with high temperature processes. At the University of New South Wales a novel laser doping method was developed, which combines the formation of the selective emitter with a self-aligned metallisation pattern. Despite achieving high efficiencies, concerns arose regarding the adhesion of the metal to the shallow laser doped areas. This issue may be alleviated by increasing the roughness of the surface or even more so by creating holes/grooves in the laser doped areas. One simple way of achieving this is by carrying out the laser doping at higher laser energies to deliberately create some ablation. This paper examines the influence of the laser power on the solar cell electrical parameters to ascertain the relationship and the tradeoff between surface roughness and electrical performance. Efficiencies above 18% on a large area commercial grade p-type CZ substrate were achieved despite some ablation, confirming the potential for using this method to improve adhesion. Efficiency of 18.7% on the same substrate, using lower laser power, demonstrates the capability of the laser doping method.

Abstract: A new accepter unit, dihexyl-2H-benzimidazole, was prepared and utilized for the synthesis of the conjugated polymers containing electron donor–acceptor pair for OPVs. Dihexyl-2H-benzimidazole unit was designed to substitute the BT unit of PCDTBT. A new series of copolymers with carbazole as the electron-rich unit and dihexyl-2H-benzimidazole as the electron-deficient unit are synthesized. To obtain absorption in the longer wavelength region, bithiophene units without any alkyl group are incorporated as one of the monomers, which may result in low solubility of the polymers. In dihexyl-2H-benzimidazole, sulfur at 2-position of BT unit was replaced with dialkyl substituted carbon, while keeping the 1,2-quinoid form, to improve the solubility of the polymers. The spectra of the solid films show absorption bands with maximum peaks at 446–457nm and the absorption onsets at 527–539nm, corresponding to bandgaps of 2.30–2.35eV. Under white light illumination (AM 1.5G, 100mW/cm2), the devices with PCBBTHBIs:PCBM layers showed open-circuit voltages (VOC) of 0.13–0.23V, short-circuit current densities (JSC) of 3.52–5.69mA/cm2, and fill factors (FF) of 0.36–0.40, giving power-conversion efficiencies of 0.21–0.47%.

Abstract: Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a neurodegenerative mycotoxin produced by Fusarium verticiloides mould that contaminates maize worldwide. FB1 toxicity has been connected with deregulation of sphingolipid metabolism, but the mechanism of cytotoxicity remains controversial. In cell cultures of rat primary astrocytes and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), we found that FB1 inhibits mitochondrial complex I, which leads to a decrease in the rate of mitochondrial and cellular respiration, depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria and deregulation of calcium signalling. Despite the increase in ROS production, the intracellular level of glutathione (GSH) was significantly increased. After 24h of FB1 exposure, no cell death was observed. Thus, mitochondria appear to be the primary target of FB1, which leads to sustained deregulation of calcium homeostasis and presumably to cell death.

Abstract: We described previously a novel role for cyclin A2/Cdk2 as a progesterone receptor (PR) coactivator. In reporter gene assays, cyclin A2 overexpression enhanced PR activity while inhibition of Cdk2 activity using the chemical inhibitor roscovitine or Cdk2 siRNA strongly inhibited PR activity. We demonstrate here that both Cdk1 and Cdk2 contribute to maximal induction of endogenous progestin responsive genes in T47D breast cancer cells. Our earlier studies suggested that the mechanism by which cyclin A2/Cdk2 enhances PR activity is via phosphorylation of steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), which increases PR-SRC-1 interactions. To assess the importance of SRC-1 phosphorylation in the regulation of PR activity, SRC-1 was phosphorylated by cyclin A2/Cdk2 in vitro and seventeen phosphorylation sites were identified using biochemical techniques. We show that one of these sites, T1426 (adjacent to the C-terminal LXXLL nuclear receptor interaction motif), is an in vivo target of Cdks in mammalian cells and an in vitro target of Cdk1 and Cdk2. Phosphorylation of T1426 also contributes to SRC-1 coactivation potential, as mutation of the threonine target site to alanine results in reduced stimulation of PR activity by SRC-1. Together, these results suggest a role for Cdk1 and Cdk2 in the regulation of endogenous PR activity in part through phosphorylation of SRC-1.

Abstract: Oxygen precipitation creates centers of recombination of carriers. Therefore, oxygen concentration and its chemical configuration must be controlled. In this study, the oxygen distribution on a multicrystalline silicon ingot produced by directional solidification of upgraded metallurgical silicon is investigated. The highest amount of oxygen was detected close to the bottom of the ingot. Most of the oxygen present was interstitial but there were approximately 5–10ppma oxygen present as precipitates. FT-IR and TEM confirmed the presence of many oxygen precipitates, mainly segregated at grain boundaries and dislocations. Lifetime measurements by QSSPC were performed on as grown- and passivated wafers, and after P-gettering. A correlation between the lifetime values and the presence of oxygen precipitates has been found and it has been shown that the electrical properties could be improved if an appropriate annealing step would be applied. Oxygen content may dramatically reduce the solar cell performances and efficiencies (estimated reduction of 1–3% absolute values).

Abstract: This article reports on the study of the oxidation of ZrC–20vol% MoSi2 in the temperature range 1800–2400K in air, in order to partially reproduce the operating conditions of a high-temperature receiver for concentrated solar radiation. Such receivers are used in solar tower power plants, this technology being likely to grow in scale in the future due to environmental concerns. A thermodynamic calculation showed the existence of a limit temperature at about 1600K, above which CO formation is significantly increased. During oxidation experiments carried out in a solar furnace, Bubble Burst Events appeared around 2000K. The formation of these bubbles was accompanied by an increase in oxidation damage for the material. It was assumed that these bubbles formed because of the surface melting of samples in addition to an increased release of CO. However ZrC was found to undergo less oxidation damage than SiC under same conditions, as demonstrated in this study. Two different ZrC surface states were studied, but no major differences were observed in terms of oxidation behavior. Results of the thermodynamic calculation and characterization of the oxide layer let us think that the addition of such a high amount of MoSi2 was detrimental to the oxidation behavior above 1800K, because of its dissociation and its role in the surface melting.

Abstract: We report on the fabrication of inverted ITO-free P3HT:PCBM solar cell modules on glass and PET foil as substrate where the organic functional layers are deposited with slot die coating, a reel to reel compatible coating technique. The active layers have been processed in ambient atmosphere, which will be of advantage in a future production and is especially remarkable as the metallic cathode is already deposited on the substrate at this stage of fabrication. The modules comprise two busses of 11 cell elements connected in series each. The series connection leads to an open circuit voltage of up to 6.88V on glass substrate, which translates to 625mV per cell element, a very competitive value for P3HT:PCBM based solar cells on glass. Although the designated area is as large as 41cm2 and the active area 26.4cm2, we obtain fill factors of up to 65% for these modules, which again is a typical value for small area laboratory cells. Remarkably the values for PET foil as substrate with an open circuit voltage of 6.5V and a fill factor of 64% are very close to the results on glass and to our knowledge the highest fill factors for flexible organic solar cells, even if compared to small area devices. The short circuit current densities and therefore efficiencies are also comparable to small area devices, if only the photoactive area is accounted for. Therefore we have demonstrated that the scale up of organic solar cells can be achieved with a suited circuitry scheme.

Abstract: Nanostructured ZnO has been synthesized by thermal decomposition of zinc oxalate without using any additives or solvents and characterized by XRD, TGA, BET, FE-SEM and HR-TEM techniques. XRD analysis showed that the synthesized catalyst has a hexagonal wurtzite-type polycrystalline structure. HR-TEM analysis revealed the formation of ZnO nanostructures and the increase in size of ZnO nanoparticle from 40 to 100nm during the formation. Nano-ZnO is found to be more efficient than commercial ZnO for mineralization of Reactive Red 120 under solar irradiation. Addition of oxone influences the photodegradation efficiency. The recyclability of ZnO nanocrystals is found to be higher than the commercial ZnO. The promoting effects of ZnO nanocatalyst for the sensitized degradation of colorants in aqueous phase have been investigated. Mineralization of RR 120 was confirmed by gas chromatography and COD values.

Abstract: The performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells based on copper phthalocyanine (CuPc)/C60 heterojunction was investigated by focusing on the role of 1,3,5-tris(2-N-phenylbenzimidazolyl) benzene (TPBi) as a cathode buffer layer. The effect of the film thickness of TPBi layer on the electrical characteristics of the device was systematically studied. The interface between the acceptor and cathode was studied with the characterization of atomic force microscope. Optical field distribution inside the OPV cell was also simulated to gain insight into the mechanism responsible for TPBi used as an optical spacer. The results indicated that at an optimal film thickness, TPBi cathode buffer layer is essential to enhance device performance by forming improved interfacial contact without introducing more series resistance and current loss.

Abstract: In this paper the simulation model of an artificial neural network (ANN) based maximum power point tracking controller has been developed. The controller consists of an ANN tracker and the optimal control unit. The ANN tracker estimates the voltages and currents corresponding to a maximum power delivered by solar PV (photovoltaic) array for variable cell temperature and solar radiation. The cell temperature is considered as a function of ambient air temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. The tracker is trained employing a set of 124 patterns using the back propagation algorithm. The mean square error of tracker output and target values is set to be of the order of 10−5 and the successful convergent of learning process takes 1281 epochs. The accuracy of the ANN tracker has been validated by employing different test data sets. The control unit uses the estimates of the ANN tracker to adjust the duty cycle of the chopper to optimum value needed for maximum power transfer to the specified load.

Abstract: Nanostructured hematite thin films were electrochemically cycled in an aqueous solution of LiOH. Through optical, structural, morphological, and magnetic measurements, the coloration mechanism of electrochromic iron oxide thin films was elucidated. The conditions for double or single electrochromic behavior are given in this work. During the electrochemical cycling, it was found that topotactic transformations of hexagonal crystal structures are favored; i.e. α-Fe2O3 to Fe(OH)2 and subsequently to δ-FeOOH. These topotactic redox reactions are responsible for color changes of iron oxide films.

Abstract: In this work, a multilayer structure, PEDOT:PSS/insulator/PEDOT:PSS (CIC), was designed and used as the anode in a polymer solar cell (PSC) to enhance the efficiency at low annealing temperature. The efficiency for PSC with CIC multilayers could increase around 22% as compared to the reference cell. The internal electrical field enhancement due to the effective work function increase by CIC multilayer was assumed and responded to efficiency enhancement. The work function of the multilayer anode structure was explored by an electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) analysis. The EFM result shows that the surface potential of PEDPT:PSS in CIC structure is around 0.6V higher than PEDOT:PSS in reference structure, indicating a higher work function for PEDOT:PSS in multilayer structure. By the input photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) study, the major enhancement in photocurrent occurred at solar spectrum range of 400–650nm. Further applied to plastic substrate, the PSC exhibits 9.2% enhancement in efficiency.

Abstract: BACKGROUND
The Eastern mediterranean Bone marrow Transplantation (EMBMT) Group has accumulated over 25 years of data and experience in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), most particularly in hemoglobinopathies, severe aplastic anemia (SAA), and inherited metabolic and immune disorders, in addition to hematologic malignancies peculiar to the region and where recent updates in trends in activities are warranted.
OBJECTIVES
To study trends in HSCT activities in the World health Organization-Eastern Mediterranean (EM) region surveyed by EMBMT between 2008 and 2009. STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective analysis of the survey data, mainly of the cumulative number of transplants, types of transplants (autologous vs. allogeneic), types of conditioning as myeloablative (MAC) vs. reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and trends in leukemias, hemoglobinopathies, SAA, inherited bone marrow failure syndromes amongst others.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fourteen teams from ten Eastern Mediterranean Region Organization (EMRO) countries reported their data (100% return rate) to the EMBMT for the years 2008-2009 with a total of 2608 first HSCT (1286 in 2008; 1322 in 2009). Allogeneic HSCT represented the majority (63%) in both years. The main indications for allogeneic HSCT were acute leukemias (732; 44%), bone marrow failure syndromes (331, 20%), hemoglobinopathies (255; 15%) and immune deficiencies (90; 5%). There was a progressive increase in the proportions of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases transplanted beyond the first chronic phase (3; 7% of all CML cases in 2008 vs 13; 29% in 2009). The main indications for autologous transplants were plasma cell disorders (345; 36%) Hodgkin disease (256; 27%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (207; 22%) and solid tumors (83; 9%). RIC continued to show a progressive increase over the years (7% in 2007, 11% in 2008 and 13% in 2009), yet remained relatively low compared to contemporary practices in Europe published by EBMT. The vast majority (95%) of allo-HSCT sources were from sibling donors with a continued dominance of peripheral blood (PB) (1076; 63%), while cord blood transplant (CBT) increased to 83 (5% of allo-HSCT), matched unrelated donor (MUD) remained underutilized (1; 0%) and there were no haploidentical transplants reported. Large centers with >50 HSCT/year showed a plateau of the total number of allo-HSCT over the last 5 years that may be related to capacity issues and needs further study.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
There is an overall increased rate of HSCT in the EMRO region with a significant increase in utilization of CBT and allogeneic PB-HSCT as a valuable source. However, further research on outcome data and development of regional donor banks (CB and MUD) may help facilitate future planning to satisfy the regional needs and increase collaboration within the group and globally.

Abstract: Antireflective (AR) coatings with high transmittance and enhanced abrasion-resistance were prepared by a base/acid two-step catalyzed sol–gel process using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as precursor. These AR coatings exhibit both high transmittance and enhanced abrasion-resistance when the mole ratio of acid-catalyzed silica to base-catalyzed silica was 0.5. The experimental results revealed that the acid-catalyzed silica was covalently bonded to base-catalyzed silica particles, which greatly increased the abrasion-resistance. Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) treatment was further used to improve the hydrophobicity of the AR coatings. The water contact angles of pure silica AR coatings and AR coatings treated with 16% HMDS were 21.3° and 72.5°, respectively, indicating a significant increase in hydrophobicity. FTIR spectra revealed the existence of –Si (CH3)3 after HMDS treatment, showing that the hydroxyl groups of AR coatings were replaced by –OSi (CH3)3, affording the AR coatings treated with HMDS excellent environmental resistance.

Abstract: Non-ultraviolet (UV) photoexposure of luminescent solar concentrators (LSC's) can produce photoproducts that cause additional extinction at wavelengths somewhat longer than the main dye absorption peak. This photo-induced ‘tails’ extinction is deleterious to luminous output in collectors of useful lengths. An experimental method that enables the subdivision of tails extinction in an LSC into absorbed and scattered components is described. The relevant theory is outlined, and experimental results are presented for a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) LSC containing Lumogen F083 dye. For this sample, tails absorption increased significantly with outdoor exposure, while tails scattering remained constant. Further measurements indicate that LSC luminous output is around five times more sensitive to tails absorption than to fluorescence quenching. This work also indicates that merely checking for dye quenching, as is often done, can be a misleading indicator of long-term LSC output.

Abstract: The potential of using distilled water in environmental friendly and non-toxic ultrasonic cleaning step in crystalline Si wafer preparation is addressed. It is found that organic particle contaminants are effectively removed during the kHz-frequency sonication of wafers over the first 40–60min, as evidenced by the disappearance of organic-related optical absorption peaks. Subsidiary effects of the sonication on electrical and photoelectrical behaviour of Si wafers are discussed. It is observed that, when treating the wafers less than 60min, the dangling bonds at the air/oxide and oxide/wafer interface can be activated. That causes a decrease in the subsurface resistance against dislocation displacements (observed micro-hardness decrease). It affects barriers of the free carrier migration at the interfaces (revealed in the current–voltage characteristics), and acts as recombination centers, accelerating photovoltage decays. A healing of the bonds may occur at longer cleaning times (≈60–120min), which partially recover the interfaces, thus reversing the observed changes. Although an exact mechanism is not yet clarified, the likely scenario behind the observed changes is proposed to involve oxygen and hydrogen molecules, which are decomposed in water and subsequently trapped at the silicon surface.

Abstract: Stainless steel (SS) mesh was used to fabricate anodes for flexible dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) in order to evaluate them as replacements for more expensive Transparent Conductor Oxides (TCO's). SS mesh performance was analyzed and it was determined that oxidation of SS during the sintering of titania particles affects the transport and interface resistance of the device. Thus a thin layer of non-porous titania coating was added onto the mesh to protect the electrode from oxidation. Comparing with Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO), SS mesh was found to have higher interface resistance but the overall series resistance was lower due to higher conductivity of metals. The effects of SS mesh opening size and microstructure on the performance of the device was analyzed and design strategies to obtain high efficiency flexible SS mesh DSSC are provided.

Abstract: Near-infrared (NIR) downconversion (DC) has been observed in a Dy3+-doped GdVO4 phosphor, where one ultraviolet-blue photon can be split efficiently into two NIR photons. Underlying mechanism for the process of NIR-DC is analyzed in terms of absorption spectrum, static and dynamic photoemission and monitored excitation spectra. Internal quantum efficiency is obtained up to 111% on the basis of experimental and theoretical calculation results. This enables the phosphor promising in significant enhancement of spectral response of silicon solar cells, particularly in the range of 200–500nm.

Abstract: Macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha (MIP-3α) is known to be upregulated early in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, the transcriptional regulation of MIP-3α is unknown. We previously demonstrated that the transcription factors KLF6 and PPAR-γ play key roles in regulating renal fibrotic and inflammatory responses to factors inherent in diabetes mellitus. Hence we determined the role of these transcription factors in regulating MIP-3α expression. HK-2 cells and STZ-induced diabetic rats were used. siRNAs, over-expressing constructs and CHIP promoter binding assays were used to determine the role of KLF6 and PPAR-γ in MIP-3α transcriptional regulation. KLF6 overexpression increased MIP-3α which was inhibited by concurrent exposure to PPAR-γ agonists. PPAR-γ agonists attenuated high glucose-induced MIP-3α secretion. Furthermore, MIP-3α secretion was up-regulated in PPAR-γ silenced cells, suggesting both KLF6 and PPAR-γ antagonistically regulate high glucose-induced MIP-3α secretion. The CHIP promoter binding assay confirmed that PPAR-γ binds to the MIP-3α promoter and negatively regulates MIP-3α expression. PPAR-γ agonists increased the binding activity of the PPAR-γ-MIP-3α promoter. In contrast, promoter binding activity decreased in KLF6 over-expressing cells. PPAR-γ decreased in KLF6 over-expressing cells and increased in KLF6 silenced cells, while PPAR-γ siRNA had no effect on KLF6 expression, suggesting that KLF6 acted upstream of PPAR-γ in the regulation of MIP-3α. In diabetic rats, renal MIP-3α and the macrophage marker ED-1 expression increased, which was inhibited by exposure to PPAR-γ agonists. The recognition of MIP-3α as a significant pathogenic mediator in diabetic nephropathy reaffirms the increasingly recognized role of inflammation in the progression of DN. Targeting pro-inflammatory chemokine MIP-3α and its signaling pathways will provide novel strategy to treat diabetic kidney disease.

Abstract: A three amino acid sequence, Ser/Thr-Pro-Ser/Thr, was recently identified and characterized as a novel nuclear localization signal (Chuderland et al., 2008). The immediate-early gene product, early growth response-1 is a three zinc finger containing transcription factor implicated in a wide variety of pathologies, and has a bipartite nuclear localization domain identified two decades ago. Efficient nuclear localization of Egr-1 is vital to its function as a transcription factor. Interestingly, Egr-1 also contains a C-terminal SPS domain (residues 482-484 in murine Egr-1). We hypothesized that 482SPS484 may also serve as a novel nuclear localization signal in Egr-1. We found that this sequence directs Egr-1 to the nucleus in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and show by co-immunoprecipitation analysis that Egr-1 forms a complex with importin-7. 482SPS484 is required for Egr-1's interaction with importin-7. Moreover, importin-7 knockdown with RNAi showed that Egr-1 nuclear translocation is importin-7-dependent. This study demonstrates that the nuclear translocation of Egr-1 is partially dependent on 482SPS484 and involves importin-7, and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms regulating the cellular localization of this pathophysiologically important transcription factor.

Abstract: Electrochromic TiO2 anatase thin films on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were prepared by doctor blade method using a colloidal solution of titanium oxide with particles of 15nm in size. The films were transparent in the visible range and well colored in a solution of 1M LiClO4 in propylene carbonate. The transmittances of the colored films were found to be strongly dependent on the Li+ inserted charges. The response time of the electrochromic device coloration was found to be as small as 2s for a 1cm2 sample and the coloration efficiency at a wavelength of 550nm reached a value as high as 33.7cm2C−1 for a 600nm thick nanocrystalline-TiO2 on a FTO-coated glass substrate. Combining the experimental data obtained from in situ transmittance spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction analysis with the data from chronoamperometric measurements, it was clearly demonstrated that Li+ insertion (extraction) into (out of) the TiO2 anatase films resulted in the formation (disappearance) of the Li0.5TiO2 compound. Potential application of nanocrystalline porous TiO2 films in large-area electrochromic windows may be considered.

Abstract: We reported the synthesis of novel polymeric semiconductor materials based on [poly(4-(5-(1,5-bis(alkoxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole)] (PANTBT) and the fabrication of solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 4.2% using the synthesized polymers blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) in bulk heterojunction geometry. By varying the side chains, three polymers were synthesized [poly(4-(5-(1,5-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PENTBT), [poly(4-(5-(1,5-bis(decyloxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PDNTBT), and [poly(4-(5-(1,5-bis(tetradecyloxy)naphthalen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PTDNTBT), maintaining a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and relatively low band gap, which lead to a high open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the resulting devices. Due to the superior miscibility of PANTBT derivatives with PC70BM, favorable phase separation with a domain size of 10–20nm was achieved regardless of the crystalline nature of the pristine polymers. PDNTBT with alkyl side chain C10 and PTDNTBT with alkyl side chain C14 showed higher photovoltaic performances. In addition, the effects of the crystalline nature of polymers on the thermal stability of the resulting solar cell devices were discussed in terms of the influence of side chains.

Abstract: In this contribution we present an in situ method for the preparation of CuInS2–poly(3-(ethyl-4-butanoate)thiophene) (P3EBT) nanocomposite layers and their application in nanocomposite solar cells. A precursor solution containing copper and indium salts, thiourea and the conjugated polymer was prepared in pyridine, which was coated onto glass/ITO substrates followed by a heating step at 180°C. The heating step induced the formation of the CuInS2 nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed in the conjugated polymer matrix. The formation of the nanocomposite was investigated in situ by X-ray scattering techniques and TEM methods showing that nano-scaled CuInS2 was formed. By addition of small amounts of zinc salt to the precursor solution, zinc containing CuInS2 (ZCIS) was formed. ZCIS–P3EBT active layers exhibited higher VOC than CuInS2–P3EBT layers and showed efficiencies of about 0.4%. Additionally the stability of the solar cells was tested over a time scale of 172h.

Abstract: This work describes the use of quasi-resonant Raman scattering measurements for the assessment of chemical composition and nanocrystalline phases in CuInS2 based photovoltaic technologies. Raman spectra measured in S-rich CuIn(S,Se)2 layers at a fixed wavelength of 785nm show a strong increase in the intensity of the peaks that are related to the quasi-resonant excitation of the corresponding vibrational modes. The spectra measured at these conditions are characterised by the presence of seven bands that have been identified with four first order peaks in the 200–400cm−1 spectral region and three second order peaks in the 550–750cm−1 spectral region. These spectra are strongly sensitive to changes in the composition of S-rich CuIn(Se,S)2 alloys. On the other hand, the strong increase in the intensity of the peaks allows the development of in-situ measurements for real time process monitoring. As an example of this application, Raman spectra have been measured at real time conditions during the growth of colloidal CuInS2 nanocrystals that are being developed for the fabrication of low cost solar cells. The data obtained corroborate the potential of quasi-resonant Raman scattering measurements for the development of ex-situ and in-situ quality control and process monitoring tools in thin film chalcopyrite photovoltaic technologies.

Abstract: Liquid phthalocyanine and fullerene derivative monomers were synthesized, which can be cationically polymerized either thermally or by light and are suitable for preparing complex solar cell structures, obtainable only by organic vacuum deposition till now. A sandwich solar cell with a bulk heterojunction layer between single layers was shown to produce higher currents and voltages than either pure bilayer or pure bulk heterojunction. The proposed in situ polymerization method can be applied to a variety of active layers for preparation of solution-processed solar cells.

A novel PKC-ι inhibitor abrogates cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma,

Abstract: Protein Kinase C-iota (PKC-ι), an atypical protein kinase C isoform manifests its potential as an oncogene by targeting various aspects of cancer cells such as growth, invasion and survival. PKC-ι confers resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. The acquisition of drug resistance is a major obstacle to good prognosis in neuroblastoma. The focus of this research was to identify the efficacy of [4-(5-amino-4-carbamoylimidazol-1-yl)-2,3-dihydroxycyclopentyl] methyl dihydrogen phosphate (ICA-1) as a novel PKC-ι inhibitor in neuroblastoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. ICA-1 specifically inhibits the activity of PKC-ι but not that of PKC-zeta (PKC-ζ), the closely related atypical PKC family member. The IC50 for the kinase activity assay was approximately 0.1μM which is 1000 times less than that of aurothiomalate, a known PKC-ι inhibitor. Cyclin dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) phosphorylates cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and promotes cell proliferation. Our data shows that PKC-ι is an in vitro Cdk7 kinase and the phosphorylation of Cdk7 by PKC-ι was potently inhibited by ICA-1. Furthermore, our data shows that neuroblastoma cells proliferate via a PKC-ι/Cdk7/cdk2 cell signaling pathway and ICA-1 mediates its antiproliferative effects by inhibiting this pathway. ICA-1 (0.1μM) inhibited the in vitro proliferation of BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells by 58% (P=0.01). Additionally, ICA-1 also induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Interestingly, ICA-1 did not affect the proliferation of normal neuronal cells suggesting its potential as chemotherapeutic with low toxicity. Hence, our results emphasize the potential of ICA-1 as a novel PKC-ι inhibitor and chemotherapeutic agent for neuroblastoma.

Abstract: Inverted organic photovoltaic devices have been fabricated by gravure printing on a flexible substrate. In order to enable printing of multiple layers sequentially, a systematic study of wetting behaviour of each layer in the device is performed. Successful wetting of a hydrophobic P3HT:PCBM surface by a hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS ink is achieved with the addition of a surfactant/alcohol to the PEDOT:PSS ink and with oxygen plasma treatment. We are therefore able to print titanium oxide, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrene sulphonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS). As result we get for three printed layers a 0.6% power conversion efficiency.

Abstract: Band gap grading is able to improve the performance of CIGS solar cells. In order to get a better understanding of the parameters influencing the effect of a grading, a closed form analytical expression of the current density is derived. The advantages and drawbacks of this analytical expression with respect to numerical simulation results are assessed. The analytical analysis has limited validity due to restrictions on the absorption characteristic and on the recombination in the space charge layer. Nevertheless it leads to good results, it has the advantage of being faster than numerical simulations and it clarifies the interrelation of the meaningful parameters.

The relationship between the chemical purity of the polymers and the performance of the devices was examined and by using a combination of OFET, OPV and hole-only devices, the best polymer purification technique identified. The purified polymers were used to optimise the fabrication of solar cells by varying the donor–acceptor blend ratio, the film thickness, the drying conditions and the concentration of the dithiol process additive.

Abstract: Passivation plays a critical role in silicon photovoltaics, yet how a passivation layer affects the optical characteristics of nano-patterned surfaces has rarely been discussed. In this paper, we demonstrate conical-frustum nanostructures fabricated on silicon solar cells using polystyrene colloidal lithography with various silicon–nitride (SiNx) passivation thicknesses. The omnidirectional and broadband antireflective characteristics were determined by utilizing angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy. The conical-frustum arrays with a height of 550nm and a SiNx thickness of 80nm effectively suppressed the Fresnel reflection in the wavelength range from 400 to 1000nm, up to an incidence angle of 60°. As a result, the power conversion efficiency achieved was 13.39%, which showed a 9.13% enhancement compared to that of a conventional KOH-textured silicon cell. The external quantum efficiency measurements confirmed that the photocurrent was mostly contributed by the increased optical absorption in the near-infrared. The angular cell efficiencies were estimated and showed improvements over large angles of incidence.

Abstract: Recently identified fundamental classes of dual-mirror double-tailored nonimaging optics have the potential to satisfy the pragmatic exigencies of concentrator photovoltaics. Via a comprehensive survey of their parameter space, including raytrace verification, we identify champion high-concentration high-efficiency designs that offer unprecedented optical tolerance (i.e., sensitivity to off-axis orientation) – a pivotal figure-of-merit with a basic bound that depends on concentration, exit angle, and effective solar angular radius. For comparison, results for the best corresponding dual-mirror aplanatic concentrators are also presented.

Abstract: An ultrathin iridium layer was treated with O2-plasma to form an iridium oxide (IrOx), employed as a hole extraction layer in order to replace poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells with poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM). The IrOx layer affects the self-organization of the P3HT:PCBM photo-active layer due to its hydrophobic nature, inducing a well-organized intraplane structure with lamellae oriented normal to the substrate. Synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that the work function increased by 0.57eV as the Ir layer on ITO changed to IrOx by the O2-plasma treatment. The OPV cell with IrOx (2.0nm) exhibits increased power conversion efficiency as high as 3.5% under 100mWcm−2 illumination with an air mass (AM 1.5G) condition, higher than that of 3.3% with PEDOT:PSS.

Abstract: Nowadays, gasochromic Pd/WO3 coatings as optically switchable materials have become more applicable for hydrogen sensors and smart windows. In this study, WO3 films were prepared by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and spin-coating sol–gel techniques. For deposition of Pd, first a layer of PdCl2 was obtained via a simple drop-drying process by dropping PdCl2 solution onto WO3 substrates and drying them at room temperature. Then Pd nanoparticles were synthesized via hydrogen gas exposure that causes reduction of the PdCl2 layer. According to Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observations before hydrogen reduction, many individual nanoparticles or fractal-like constructions of palladium were formed in the PdCl2 layer in which the fractal branches were distorted after hydrogen treatment. Surface chemistry of the observed Pd nanoparticles was studied using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) at different stages of the reduction process. The results showed that after hydrogen treatment, the chlorine atoms were desorbed from the PdCl2 layer and a metallic Pd layer remained on the surface of WO3. Gasochromic properties in the presence of H2 or O2 gases for different PdCl2 amounts revealed that the rate and saturated level of coloring depends on the PdCl2 amounts as well as on the preparation method of the WO3 substrates due to different porosities.

Abstract: We fabricated P3HT:PCBM bulk hetero-junction solar cells, where a 5nm layer of NiO sputtered on top of ITO is used as an effective electron blocking layer. All the steps involving the processing of the organic materials were performed in ambient air. Under 1 sun of AM1.5G illumination such NiO cells exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 3.3% compared to 3.1% exhibited by a PEDOT:PSS cell fabricated under similar conditions. We observed that for the NiO cell processing in air was not detrimental to the ulterior performance of the cell, which in ambient air degraded with a time constant of 303h. On the contrary, the PEDOT:PSS cell degraded very rapidly and the loss in efficiency was shown to be 29 times faster when compared to that of the NiO cell.

Abstract: Polo-like kinases (Plks) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are involved in the regulation of the various stages of the cell cycle. Plk2 and Plk3, two members of this family, are known to interact with calcium- and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1). Activity of both Plk2 and Plk3 is inhibited by CIB1 in a calcium-dependent manner. However, the physiological consequences of this inhibition are not known. Here, we show that overexpression of CIB1 inhibits T47D cell proliferation. Overexpression of CIB1 or knockdown of Plk3 using shRNA produced a multinucleated phenotype in T47D cells. This phenotype was not cancer cell specific, since it also occurred in normal cells. The cells overexpressing CIB1 appear to undergo proper nuclear division, but are unable to complete the process of cytokinesis, thus forming large multinucleated cells. Both CIB1 overexpression and Plk3 knockdown disrupted microtubule organization and centrosomal segregation, which may have led to incomplete cytokinesis. The observed effect of CIB1 overexpression is not due to the inhibition of Plk2 by CIB1. Plk3 and CIB1 both colocalize at the centrosomes, however, localization of CIB1 is dependent on the expression of Plk3. Furthermore, expression of Plk3 blocks the multinucleated phenotype induced by expression of CIB1 in these cells. These results suggest that CIB1 tightly regulates Plk3 activity during cell division and that either over- or underexpression results in a multinucleated phenotype.

Transgenic overexpression of HSP56 does not result in cardiac hypertrophy nor protect from ischaemia/reperfusion injury,

Abstract: Heat shock proteins are known to be induced during and following different forms of cardiac stress. It has previously been shown that their expression is beneficial for the heart following trauma such as ischaemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. Heat shock protein 56 (HSP56) belongs to the family of FK506-binding immunophilin proteins and is found in steroid receptor complexes, notably the glucocorticoid receptor. We have previously shown that HSP56 and other HSPs are induced in cardiac myocytes treated with cardiotrophin-1, a cytokine with potent hypertrophic and protective properties on cardiac cells. The hypertrophic action of cardiotrophin-1 on cardiac cells is dependent on HSP56 induction and overexpression of HSP56 is sufficient for inducing hypertrophy in cardiac cells. To investigate this phenomenon in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing HSP56 and assessed them for the development cardiac hypertrophy and resistance of their hearts to I/R-injury by Langendorff perfusion. Mice generated demonstrated stable, yet varying expression levels of HSP56. Initial characterisation identified a sex-specific phenotype where male overexpressing mice exhibited a moderate, but significant, reduced body weight compared to wild-type controls. In ex vivo stress analyses we found, unexpectedly, that significant overexpression of HSP56 does not induce myocardial hypertrophy and nor does it protect the intact heart from I/R-injury. These observations now suggest a more intricate HSP56-Sp. Cardiophenotype that requires further studies to determine if HSP56 is necessary in mediating hypertrophy induced by other myocardial stimuli.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence that p38 MAPK, which is classified as a stress-activated kinase, also participates in cell cycle regulation, functioning as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We conducted a study of p38 MAPK phosphorylation during liver regeneration in mice to determine whether p38 MAPK activation or inactivation may correlate with events that lead to DNA replication after partial hepatectomy (PH), and whether p38 MAPK activation may be required for hepatocyte DNA replication in vivo and in culture. We report that active p38 (Pi-p38 MAPK) is present in normal liver, is rapidly inactivated starting 30min after PH, and is re-activated by 12h. Although levels of Pi-MKK 3/6, the upstream kinases that activate p38 MAPK increase after PH, the expression of the dual protein phosphatase 1 is also elevated, and may be responsible for Pi-p38 MAPK dephosphorylation after PH. Inactivation and re-activation of p38 MAPK inversely correlates with the stimulation of protein synthesis and translation pathways, as indicated by activation of p70S6 kinase, increases in the phosphorylation of initiation factor elF-4E and translational repressor, 4E-BP. The activity of a p38 MAPK downstream substrate, MAPKAPK2 (MK2), did not reflect the changing levels of Pi-p38 MAPK during liver regeneration. Pi-p38 MAPK may be involved in TNF-stimulated DNA replication of murine hepatocytes in culture, but is not necessary for hepatocyte DNA replication after PH. Our results suggest that p38 MAPK inactivation plays a permissible role in DNA replication during liver regeneration and is consistent with a role for p38 MAPK in the maintenance of hepatocyte cell cycle arrest in adult liver.

Abstract: A bilayer polymer solar cell is demonstrated with the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly(3-hexylthiophene)/C70/Al. In this article, we highlight the importance of polymer surface morphology, its crystallinity and mobility on device output parameters. The solvent used for polymer processing plays a major role in deciding these parameters and it was observed that high boiling point solvents are desirable for achieving large surface roughness of the polymer layer, which in turn provide more interface area in the bilayer device structure. Due to the increased interface area for exciton dissociation, these bilayer devices resulted in a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.65% under one sun radiation.

Abstract: This paper deals with the preparation, characterization, and determination of thermal energy storage properties of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/diatomite composite as a novel form-stable composite phase change material (PCM). The composite PCM was prepared by incorporating PEG in the pores of diatomite. The PEG could be retained by 50wt% into pores of the diatomite without the leakage of melted PEG from the composite. The composite PCM was characterized by using SEM and FT-IR analysis technique. Thermal properties of the composite PCM were determined by DSC analysis. DSC results showed that the melting temperature and latent heat of the composite PCM are 27.70°C and 87.09J/g, respectively. Thermal cycling test was conducted to determine the thermal reliability of the composite PCM and the results showed that the composite PCM had good thermal reliability and chemical stability. TG analysis showed that the impregnated PEG into the diatomite had good thermal stability. Thermal conductivity of the composite PCM was improved by adding expanded graphite in different mass fractions. Thermal energy storage performance of the composite PCM was also tested.

Abstract: Two C60 derivatives, biindene-C60 monoadduct (BC60MA) and biindene-C60 bisadduct (BC60BA), were synthesized by an one-pot reaction of 1, 1′-biindene and C60, for the application as acceptor materials in Polymer Solar Cells (PSCs). The two C60 derivatives possess good solubility in toluene and o-dichlorobenzene, and the solubility of BC60BA is even better than that of BC60MA. The electrochemical properties and the LUMO energy levels of the two fullerene derivatives were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The LUMO energy levels of BC60MA and BC60BA were 0.06 and 0.17eV higher (up-shifted) than that of PCBM, respectively. The PSCs based on P3HT as donor and BC60MA or BC60BA as acceptor exhibited higher Voc of 0.68 and 0.82V, respectively, which is benefited from the higher LUMO energy levels of the C60 derivatives. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC based on P3HT/BC60MA was 2.21% after annealing at 140°C for 5min.

Abstract: In this paper, silicon nitride thin films with different silane and ammonia gas ratios were deposited and characterized for the antireflection and passivation layer of high efficiency single crystalline silicon solar cells. An increase in the transmittance and a recombination decrease using an effective antireflection and passivation layer can be enhanced by an optimized SiNx film in order to attain higher solar cell efficiencies. As the flow rate of the ammonia gas increased, the refractive index decreased and the band gap increased. Consequently, the transmittance increased due to the higher band gap and the decrease of the defect states, which existed for the 1.68 and 1.80eV in the SiNx films. The interface trap density found in silicon can be reduced down to 1.0×1010cm−2eV−1 for the SiNx layer deposited under the optimized silane to ammonia gas ratio. Reduction in the carrier lifetime of the SiNx films deposited using a higher NH3/SiH4 flow ratio was caused by the increase of the interface traps and the defect states in/on the interface between the SiNx and the silicon wafer. Silicon and nitrogen rich films are not suitable for generating both higher carrier lifetimes and transmittance. An improvement in the single c-Si solar cell parameters was observed for the cells with an optimal SiNx layer, as compared to those with non-optimal SiNx layers. These results indicate that the band gap and the defect states of the SiNx films should be carefully controlled in order to obtain the maximum efficiency for c-Si solar cells.

Abstract: Tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO) thin films have been investigated as an alternative to indium tin oxide (ITO) anodes in organic solar cells (OSCs). The surface morphology, electrical, and optical properties of the IWO films grown by electron beam deposition were studied as a function of oxygen flow rate. For 120nm thick IWO films deposited on float glass substrates at 350°C and oxygen flow rate of 35sccm, an electrical resistivity of 4.78×10−4Ωcm and average transmittance of over 78% between 400 and 2000nm were obtained. OSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butlyric acid methyl ester were prepared on glass/IWO electrodes and the device performance was investigated as a function of IWO films with different oxygen flow rates. OSCs fabricated on the optimum IWO anode (oxygen flow rate of 30–35sccm) exhibited a power conversion efficiency of ∼3.5%, which is comparable with the same device made on commercial glass/ITO electrodes (3.75%).

Abstract: We synthesized oleic acid capped tetrapod nanocrystals of CdSe, CdTe and type II heterostructured CdTe/CdSe to investigate the effects of nanocrystal compositions and type II heterojunction on the photovoltaic properties of hybrid solar cells. The hybrid solar cell based on the blend of CdSe tetrapod nanocrystals and P3HT with a weight ratio of 6:1 showed the maximum power conversion efficiency of 1.03% under AM 1.5G condition, and the maximum incident photon to current conversion efficiency of the solar cell was 43% at 415nm. Although CdTe and CdTe/CdSe tetrapod nanocrystals showed relatively poor performance, the power conversion efficiency and the short circuit current density of the hybrid solar cell based on type II heterostructured CdTe/CdSe tetrapod nanocrystals was 4.4 and 3.9 times higher than that of the solar cell based on CdTe tetrapod nanocrystals, respectively. These results can be explained by the effects of nanocrystal compositions and type II heterojunction on the photovoltaic properties of hybrid solar cells.

Abstract: RAB25 plays an important role in tumor progression and aggressiveness; altered RAB25 expression may cause human cancer. As the underlying mechanism of RAB25-mediated carcinogenesis in various tumor types progressively comes to light, RAB25 is expected to represent a novel therapeutic target. However, the regulation of RAB25 expression per se has not yet been described. Here we have firstly identified and characterized the human RAB25 promoter. Using PCR-based chromatin accessibility and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, an open chromatin conformation (−173/+17) was detected around the transcription start site of the RAB25 gene. Deletion constructs of the 5′ flanking region were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. After transient transfection in gastric cancer cell line AGS, a CRE (−67/−58) binding CREB was identified in the core promoter region. Electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and ChIP assays demonstrated that CREB binds to the core promoter. Deletion of CREB consensus sequence resulted in the total loss of the promoter activity. Moreover, we have also found forskolin, PKA activator, could enhance open chromatin accessibility, by which to expose the CRE and facilitate phosphorylation of CREB, which in turn recruits co-factor CBP and Brg I and then results in a more open chromatin configuration associated with local histone modification, finally heightening RAB25 expression and strengthening its promoter activity. Therefore, the present study delineates the fundamental elements of a core promoter structure that will be helpful for future studies regarding the regulation of RAB25 gene.

Abstract: Latent heat storage (LHS) can theoretically provide large heat storage density and significantly reduce the storage material volume by using the material’s fusion heat, Δhm. Phase change materials (PCMs) commonly suffer from low thermal conductivities, being around 0.4Wm−1K−1 for inorganic salts, which prolong the charging and discharging period. The problem of low thermal conductivity is a major issue that needs to be addressed for high temperature thermal energy storage systems. Since porous materials have high thermal conductivities and high surface areas, they can be used to form composites with PCMs to significantly enhance heat transfer. In this paper, the feasibility of using metal foams and expanded graphite to enhance the heat transfer capability of PCMs in high temperature thermal energy storage systems is investigated. The results show that heat transfer can be significantly enhanced by both metal foams and expanded graphite, thereby reducing the charging and discharging period. Furthermore, the overall performance of metal foams is superior to that of expanded graphite.

Abstract: The presence of a transparent conductive electrode such as indium tin oxide (ITO) limits the reliability and cost price of organic photovoltaic devices as it is brittle and expensive. Moreover, the relative high sheet resistance of an ITO electrode on flexible substrates limits the maximum width of a single cell. We have developed an alternative ITO-free transparent anode, based on solution processed high conductive PEDOT:PSS in combination with a printed current collecting grid. The screen printed silver grid demonstrates a typical sheet resistance of 1Ω/□ with 6.4–8% surface coverage. The efficiency of a flexible device with an active area of 4cm2 with such a grid is much higher than a similar device based on ITO. Furthermore, as this composite anode is solution-processed, it is a step forward towards low-cost large area processing.

Abstract: CuInS2-based solar cells have a strong potential of achieving high efficiencies due to their ideal band gap of 1.5eV. A further increase in the efficiency is expected from doping the absorber film with gallium due to enlargement of the band gap (Eg) and correspondingly the open-circuit voltage (VOC). We investigated Cu(In,Ga)S2 solar cells obtained from stacked metal layers sputtered from In and (Cu,Ga) targets followed by rapid thermal processing (RTP) in sulfur vapor. Depending on the actual RTP temperature profile, the films might exhibit CuInS2/CuGaS2 (top/bottom) segregation, which is rather detrimental for a large VOC. We found that only precursors sulfurized at sufficiently high temperatures exhibit the desired interdiffusion of the segregated CuInS2/CuGaS2 layers resulting in an increased VOC. Moreover, temperature dependent current–voltage profiling (suns-VOC-analysis) yielded strong indications for improved current collection and reduced losses for devices with proper interdiffusion of the CuInS2/CuGaS2 layers. A more fundamental question is related to the variation and formation of defect states in differently processed absorber films. The studied samples were thus further investigated by means of admittance spectroscopy, which allowed us to confirm the presence of three individual defect states in both absorber configurations. Two defects exhibit activation energies, which remain unchanged upon varying the RTP temperature whereas a third state exhibits significantly increased activation energy in devices showing interdiffusion of CuInS2/CuGaS2 layers. According to the characteristic shift of the conduction band edge upon Ga-doping we conclude that the latter defect level corresponds with the minority carriers in the p-type absorbers.

Abstract: The glycoprotein erythropoietin (Epo) is a hematopoietic cytokine necessary for the survival of erythrocytes from immature erythroid cells. The mitogen-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) plays an important role in the proliferation and survival of erythroid cells in response to Epo. However, the precise mechanism of JNK1 activation promoting erythroid cell survival is incompletely understood. Here, we reported that JNK1 is required for Epo-mediated cell survival through phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic, Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only Bcl-associated death protein (Bad). Upon Epo withdrawal, HCD57 cells, a murine Epo-dependent cell line, displayed increased apoptotic cell death that was associated with decreased JNK1 activity. Epo withdrawal-induced apoptosis was promoted by inhibition of JNK1 activity but suppressed by expression of a constitutively active JNK1. Furthermore, Epo-activated JNK1 phosphorylated Bad at threonine 201, thereby inhibiting the association of Bad with the anti-apoptotic molecule B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL). Replacement of threonine 201 by alanine in Bad promoted Epo withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Thus, our results provide a molecular mechanism by which JNK1 contributes to the survival of erythroid cells.
