Abstract: Laser-doped boron selective emitters are an ideal candidate for enabling less emitter recombination, lower contact resistance and better blue response of efficient n-type silicon solar cells. However, the low boron concentration of the borosilicate glasses formed during boron diffusion processes and the implementation of ultraviolet lasers have hindered the commercialization of laser-doped boron selective emitters. In this contribution, separate BBr3 diffusion processes for green-laser-doped selective emitters are demonstrated. Laser doping processes were conducted between (1) borosilicate glass deposition and boron driving in and (2) post-oxidation, achieving the optimized laser doped selective emitter with the Rsheet,p+/Rsheet,p++ of 95.0 Ω/□/54.3 Ω/□, accompanying with the p+ profile of Nmax < 1.4× 1019 cm−3. By comparison to the homogeneous emitter with sheet resistance of 88.9 Ω/□, J0e, total of 45.3 fA/cm2 and ρc, metal of 2.9 mΩ/cm2, the employment of the optimum laser doped selective emitter has resulted in the J0e, total of 31.1 fA/cm2 and the ρc, metal of 1.0 mΩ/cm2. Finally, the improvement of simulated VOC (699.6 mV), FF (81.38%) and efficiency (23.13%) were obtained by using the optimized laser doped SEs, compared with the simulated VOC (694.5 mV), FF (81.14%) and efficiency (22.89%) of the reference. Separate BBr3 diffusion processes for green-laser-doped selective emitters demonstrate the employment of industrial green laser and boron diffusion furnace, instead of expensive ultraviolet laser and other complex boron resources, indicating a promising potential for industrial feasibility.

Abstract: Magnesium zinc oxide (MZO) is a promising front contact material for CdTe solar cells. Due to its higher band gap than traditional CdS, MZO can reduce parasitic absorption to significantly increase short-circuit current density while also providing a benefit of conduction band offset tuning through Mg:Zn ratio optimization. MZO has been successfully implemented into CdTe devices, however its stability has been of concern. The MZO stability issue has been attributed to the presence of oxygen in the CdTe device processing ambient, leading to double-diode behavior (S-kink) in the current density-voltage curves. Here we report on MZO thin films deposited by reactive co-sputtering. The reactively co-sputtered MZO thin films have encouraging stability, show no significant variation in work function of the surface over a period of 6 months, as measured by Kelvin probe. Energy conversion efficiencies of around 16% have been achieved both with and without presence of oxygen in device processing ambients across multiple research facilities. These efficiencies should be possible to increase further by tuning of the thin film deposition and device processing parameters, especially through optimization of the back contact.

Abstract: Cadmium (Cd), a heavy metal pollutant, contributes to neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, we have demonstrated that Cd induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes apoptosis in neuronal cells. Whether X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is involved in Cd-induced ROS-dependent neuronal apoptosis remains unclear. Here, we show that Cd-induced ROS reduced the expression of XIAP, which resulted in up-regulation of murine double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and down-regulation of p53, leading to apoptosis in PC12 cells and primary neurons. Inhibition of MDM2 with Nutlin-3a reversed Cd-induced reduction of p53 and substantially rescued cells from excess ROS-dependent death. Overexpression of XIAP protected against Cd induction of ROS-dependent neuronal apoptosis. Inhibition of XIAP by Embelin strengthened Cd-induced ROS and apoptosis in the cells. Furthermore, we found that Cd inactivation of XIAP pathway was attributed to Cd induction of mitochondrial ROS, as evidenced by using a mitochondrial superoxide indicator MitoSOX and a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant Mito-TEMPO. Taken together, these results indicate that Cd induces mitochondrial ROS inactivation of XIAP-MDM2-p53 pathway leading to apoptosis in neuronal cells. Our findings suggest that activators of XIAP or modulation of XIAP-MDM2-p53 pathway by antioxidants may be exploited for the prevention of Cd-induced oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: New electrochromic devices based on six extended viologen derivatives with various aromatic substituents were manufactured and systematically investigated. With the introduction of various substituents, six extended viologen derivatives exhibit an unprecedented electrochromic property among previous researches on viologens. Electrochromic devices containing these derivatives as the working electrode present vivid color changes, high optical contrast, fast response and excellent durability. Additionally, the extended skeletal pyridine π-system endows these viologens derivatives with unanticipated electrofluorochromic behavior, which provides the devices of these extended viologens multifunction. To sum up, preeminent optical and electrical performances indicate that these extended viologen derivatives are promising for new-generation electrochromic applications.

Abstract: By strongly reflecting solar radiation and being highly emissive within the atmospheric window, daytime radiative coolers can achieve sub-ambient temperature under direct sunlight. Radiative cooling performance is strongly coupled to specific climatic conditions since cooling efficiency is strongly affected by ambient air temperature, wind speed, and solar and ambient radiation intensity. In this paper, using a well-validated thermal model, the cooling performance of three radiative cooling materials with varying optical properties was evaluated under three distinct and representative climates. This analysis permits us to better understand the sensitivity of daytime radiative cooling materials to different climatic conditions, present strategies for selecting the ideal spectral properties of materials and investigate how to enhance cooling performance under adverse climatic conditions. It is shown that radiative cooling materials have better performance in hot and arid climates. Most radiative cooling materials exhibit the greatest response to changes in ambient radiation. Higher ambient air temperatures correspond to larger sub-ambient temperature of the surfaces, but this change is lower than that of the corresponding air temperature. Furthermore, by coupling a special optical grating window onto the surface of a radiative cooler, cooling performance can be significantly enhanced by asymmetrically reflecting incoming radiation but permitting outgoing emission. While an ideal material that only emits in the atmospheric window wavelengths presents the best performance under a large range of solar radiation, ambient radiation, and air temperature, the broadband ideal emitter exhibits higher cooling potential when coupled with the optical grating window.

Abstract: The structural, optical and excitonic characteristics of MAxCs1-xPb(IxBr1-x)3 crystal thin films were investigated by using the X-ray diffraction patterns, scanning electron microscopic images, absorbance spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The time-dependent PL spectra shows that the MA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 crystal thin film is a photo-stable light absorbing material, which results in an efficient and stable perovskite solar cell without the additional encapsulation. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 solar cells is 10.02%. In addition, the PCE decreases slowly toward a stable value (5.71%) for more than 120 days under moderate environment conditions (55–60 RH%).

Abstract: MiR-222 and miR-126 are associated with asbestos exposure and the ensuing malignancy, but the mechanism(s) of their regulation remain unclear. We evaluated the mechanism by which asbestos regulates miR-222 and miR-126 expression in the context of cancer etiology. An ‘in vitro’ model of carcinogen-induced cell transformation was used based on exposing bronchial epithelium BEAS-2B cells to three different carcinogens including asbestos. Involvement of the EGFR pathway and the role of epigenetics have been investigated in carcinogen-transformed cells and in malignant mesothelioma, a neoplastic disease associated with asbestos exposure. Increased expression of miR-222 and miR-126 were found in asbestos-transformed cells, but not in cells exposed to arsenic and chrome. Asbestos-mediated activation of the EGFR pathway and macrophages-induced inflammation resulted in miR-222 upregulation, which was reversed by EGFR inhibition. Conversely, asbestos-induced miR-126 expression was affected neither by EGFR modulation nor inflammation. Rather than methylation of the miR-126 host gene EGFL7, epigenetic mechanism involving DNMT1- and PARP1-mediated chromatin remodeling was found to upregulate of miR-126 in asbestos-exposed cells, while miR-126 was downregulated in malignant cells. Analysis of MM tissue supported the role of PARP1 in miR-126 regulation. Therefore, activation of the EGFR pathway and the PARP1-mediated epigenetic regulation both play a role in asbestos-induced miRNA expression, associated with in asbestos-induced carcinogenesis and tumor progression.

Abstract: Functions of electrochromism and energy exchange can be achieved by redox reactions, which indicate designing a bi-functional electrochromic energy storage device (EESD) is feasible. In this paper, a NiO/PB composite nanosheet electrode was prepared via loading Prussian blue (iron (Ⅲ) hexacyanoferrate (Ⅱ), PB) nanoparticles on the surface of NiO nanosheets, meanwhile, a high-performance WO3 negative electrode was also prepared via novel erythritol-assisted hydrothermal method with NH4Cl used as capping agent. The designed EESD exhibited properties of large optical modulation (67.6% at 630 nm), high coloration efficiency (109.6 cm2 C-1), fast switching speed (2.8/7.9 s for bleaching/coloration) and long cycle life (ΔT remaining was 84.1% after 4000 cycles). Meanwhile, the EESD also obtained attractive energy storage properties at a potential window from 0 to +1.3 V. Impressively, the EESD exhibited a high areal capacitance of 11.50 mF cm-2 at current density of 0.05 mA cm-2 and the process of charging/discharging can be repeated at least 4000 cycles with a little decay. Therefore, the bi-functional EESD exhibits high promising application prospect.

Abstract: Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) has for decades been the material of choice for photovoltaic (PV) module encapsulation. However, while it is relatively inexpensive and initially adheres well to module components, EVA discolors with age and—as interfacial adhesion degrades—becomes susceptible to delamination, ultimately resulting in reduced module efficiency and shortened service lifetimes. As potential replacements for EVA, ionomer thermoplastic materials cure faster, are more resistant to discoloration and potential induced degradation, and do not evolve corrosive acetic acid, making them compatible with new device materials such as perovskites. Since there is limited information on ionomer durability for PV module applications, a series of field and accelerated laboratory aging studies were conducted to assess ionomer interface stability in the presence of terrestrial environmental stressors. It is shown that adhesion to the glass and cell interfaces of PV modules is inferior to EVA, both before and after aging, rendering ionomers particularly susceptible to delamination after short timeframes. Potential solutions to improve ionomer adhesion are discussed.

Abstract: The current loss is mainly due to the reflection and the parasitic absorption in the indium tin oxide (ITO) and amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in the front side of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. In this paper, we implemented n-type hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxide (n-μc-SiOx:H) as the front surface field (FSF) to improve the short-circuit current density (JSC) of SHJ solar cells. The advantage of employing n-μc-SiOx:H layer is due to its low optical absorption coefficient and tunable refractive index. However, the introduction of carbon dioxide increases light transmission but reduces the crystallinity of n-μc-SiOx:H layer. Meanwhile, inhibiting the incubation layer and increasing microcrystalline/amorphous mixture phase during the growth are critical to the solar cell performance. Therefore, we implemented a high phosphorus-doping seed layer to form a nucleation layer to improve the crystallinity of n-μc-SiOx:H layer. In addition, the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process parameters of each layer were optimized to obtain good optical and electrical properties of n-μc-SiOx:H layer. Finally, a 242.5 cm2 solar cell had been fabricated with conversion efficiency of 23.87%, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 739.8 mV, fill factor (FF) of 82.33% and JSC of 39.19 mA/cm2, which was 0.31 mA/cm2 higher than that of the conventional n type a-Si:H SHJ solar cells.

Abstract: The corrosion behaviours of Fe-Cr-Al alloy in four types of molten eutectic salts-chlorinated salt, carbonate salt, mixture of carbonate salt and MgO and nitrate salt-have been investigated in this paper. The experimental temperatures were chosen to be near the melting points of various eutectic salts and the longest holding time was sustained to 30 days in the isothermal experiments. The microstructures of the samples before and after corrosion tests were detected by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope techniques. The research indicates, among the three eutectic salts, the corrosion of Fe-Cr-Al alloys in the molten chlorinated eutectic salt is the strongest with the thickness of corrosion scales between 40 and 180 μm. The corrosion in molten carbonate eutectic salt is relatively moderate, and the corrosive thickness is between 2 and 8 μm. For the molten nitrate eutectic salt, no obvious corrosion with special morphology was observed. The corrosion strength of the four eutectic salts should be in the order of chlorine eutectic salt > (carbonate eutectic salt + MgO) > carbonate eutectic salt > nitrate eutectic salt.

Abstract: The indulgent success of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in the induction of complete remission in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients has accommodated this agent into the therapeutic protocols. However, the intrusion of unfavorable side effects had put an unanswered question on the way of the application of this agent; whether the benefits of ATO may outweigh its drawbacks. In this study, we found that when ATO is accompanied by an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARγ), even the lower concentrations could induce significant inhibitory effects on the survival of NB4 through diminishing the ability of the cells to replicate DNA in the S phase of cell cycle. We also found that through suppression of the PI3K pathway, the combination of pioglitazone and ATO provided a signal through which the induction of apoptotic cell death was enhanced probably via the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). With respect to the tight connection between PI3K pathway and autophagy system and given to the inhibitory effect of pioglitazone-plus-ATO on PI3K, we found that the combination of these agents not only suppressed the expression of autophagy-related genes, but also their efficacy was augmented when autophagy was inhibited in NB4; clarifying the encouraging role of autophagy in the survival maintenance of APL cells. In conclusion, given the significant efficacy as well as the safety profile of pioglitazone in potentiating the anticancer effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, the present study suggests it as a promising agent to be used in adjuvant strategy for the treatment of APL.

Abstract: PbS colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) are promising photovoltaic devices with a broad spectral response, solution processability and long-term air stability. Recently, major progresses have been achieved in the performance enhancement of CQDSCs through the chemical surface passivation of CQDs and the device engineering. However, the p-type PbS-EDT hole extraction layer presents high surface-trap density, which induces charge recombination risk and blocks the hole extraction at the PbS-EDT/Au interface. Herein, we demonstrated a method to passivate the surface traps of PbS-EDT film by post-depositing an aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer using atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology. The ALD progress was carefully controlled to ensure that ALD Al2O3 could overcoat and infill the PbS-EDT film at the same time. This ALD Al2O3 treatment efficiently passivated the surface traps of PbS-EDT and successfully kept the proper band alignment at PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT interface for the fast hole extraction of CQDSCs. Consequently, this method allowed the efficient carrier extraction at the PbS-EDT/Au interface through suppressing trap-induced reverse Schottky barrier. A power conversion efficiency of 7.07% was finally obtained in the PbS CQDSCs with ALD Al2O3.

Abstract: As one of the major global health issues, allergic disease represents a considerable burden both on individual patients and public health. (-)-Asarinin (Asa), a lignan isolated from the roots of Asiasari radix, was reported to be associated with anti-allergic effect, but its efficacy and mechanism of action remain unclear. This study investigated the inhibitory effect of Asa on allergic reaction and its mechanism of action. Asa significantly suppressed Ag-sensitized human mast cell line LAD2 calcium mobilization, degranulation, and secretion. It also could reduce OVA-induced local and system anaphylaxis of mice in vivo. Further experiments revealed that Asa inhibit the mast cell activation by preventing the phosphorylation of Src family kinases. Moreover, after the IgE-dependent murine model of allergic rhinitis was treated with Asa, not only the concentration of histamine, total IgE, and IL-4 decreased, but also the inflammatory infiltrates and nasal mucosa incrassation were attenuated significantly. Meanwhile, Asa also inhibited the activation of mast cells induced by Compound48/80 in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, Asa may serve as a potential novel Src family kinase inhibitor to inhibit IgE-dependent andIgE-independent allergic reaction and treat anaphylactic disease.

Abstract: Gallium phosphide is an important material in terms of III-V semiconductors integration on Si. In this work we study photovoltaic properties of GaP:Be/GaNP (Eg ~ 2.0eV)/GaP:Si p-i-n heterostructure grown on Si (100) with GaP buffer by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Correlation between the structural and optoelectronic properties of the fabricated device was studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron beam induced current (EBIC) and deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) techniques. The I–V characteristic of the fabricated mesa diode demonstrates short circuit current of 2.2 mA/cm2 and open circuit voltage of 0.8 V. TEM studies of the epilayer structural properties demonstrate high density of antiphase domains in the n-doped GaP buffer layer; however, they found to be annihilated in dilute nitride layer, where mainly threading dislocations were formed. EBIC investigation shows that crystalline imperfections of the heterostructure leads to poor carriers transport affecting the energy conversion efficiency. We performed numerical modeling concerning presence of the structural defects and discuss their influence on the diode performance. The carried out study is the initial step on the way to development of the growth technique of the GaP-based dilute nitride direct bandgap materials on Si for photonic and photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: Drug resistance and recurrence are significant contributors to the poor prognosis of serous ovarian cancer (SOC). Radiotherapy is primarily used for the treatment of cancer recurrence; however, it is rarely applied in cases of SOC. Ku86, also known as XRCC5(X-ray repair cross complementing 5), has rarely been reported in the radiotherapy of SOC. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of Ku86 in the development of SOC and in radiotherapy sensitivity induced by X-ray. In vitro experiments and database analysis showed significantly elevated expression of Ku86 in SOC. Further, after down-regulating Ku86 using RNAi technology, cell proliferation was inhibited. Further, the cell cycle was blocked in the G2 phase, and G2/G1 was increased since X-ray irradiation led to an increase in γ-H2AX. Down-regulation of Ku86 in the case of X-ray irradiation will promote the above biological effects, with more γ-H2AX and higher G2/G1. Here, we further deduce that Ku86 promotes the X-ray induced effect is most likely to activate the ATR pathway to block the cell cycle while inhibiting the NHEJ pathway to inhibit DNA damage response(DDR). Together these ﬁndings suggest that the down-regulation of Ku86 can improve X-ray-induced radiotherapy by affecting ATR and NHEJ pathways, and provide a new strategy for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Synergistic effects as a result of combining different photoactive materials provide a promising pathway to improve the photoelectrochemical performance in heterojunction devices for solar water splitting. The photoelectrochemical characteristics of tungsten trioxide (WO3) and bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) have been studied, comparing the single-phase materials with two heterojunction systems based on a WO3 underlayer and a thin, spin-coated BiVO4 top layer, using two types of underlayer: (i) a nanorod-based WO3 substrate prepared by hydrothermal methods (nr-WO3/BiVO4); and (ii) a spin-coated thin, compact WO3 substrate (pl-WO3/BiVO4). Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was used to determine the charge separation efficiency, internal and external quantum efficiencies, and process time constants for the four systems in a phosphate buffer at pH 7, both without and with an added hole scavenger, Na2SO3. The heterojunction systems show excellent performance, which is ascribed to the superior capability of WO3 to extract photogenerated electrons from the BiVO4 film that acts as the main absorber. IMPS convincingly shows that the heterojunction configuration prevents surface recombination at the BiVO4 /electrolyte interface, as well as the detrimental surface modification generally observed for WO3 photoelectrodes. The improved electron transport properties of the nr-WO3 substrate and the large area of the heterojunction interface result in better performance for nr-WO3/BiVO4, where at 455 nm water photo-oxidation is quantitative. For the single-phase BiVO4 photoelectrodes, an interesting photocurrent switching phenomenon is observed in the presence of the hole scavenger, indicating the intricate interplay between electron trapping and hole charge transfer; this phenomenon is prevented by the heterojunction structure because of the rapid electron extraction by WO3. These results show that IMPS gives detailed information on the reasons for the excellent performance of heterojunction systems, providing opportunities to design new, more efficient solar water splitting systems.

Abstract: Direct reprogramming of non-neural lineages to functional neurons holds great potential for neural development, neurological disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. Recent work has shown that single transcription factor Ascl1 can directly reprogram fibroblasts into neuronal cells under co-culture system with glial cells. It is confirmed that Ascl1 is the key driver in the reprogramming of induced neuronal cells (iNCs). However, most reprogramming methods use genetic materials and/or potentially mutagenic molecules to generate iNCs. Herein, we used 30Kc19 protein as a novel fusion partner of transcription factor Ascl1 to induce direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to neuronal cells. We demonstrated soluble expression and stability of Ascl1 protein was increased and maintained by co-expression with 30Kc19 protein, respectively. We confirmed that intracellular delivery of the fusion protein resulted in iNC generation. Protein-induced neuronal cells (p-iNCs) expressed neuronal protein markers (MAP2, Tuj1) and transcriptional genes (Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l). Protein-based direct reprogramming system eliminates the potential risk associated with the use of genetic materials. This method is anticipated to be useful for safe generation of patient-specific human neuronal cells for future applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: The activation of the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) regulates the human ether a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channel via protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn induces lethal arrhythmia in patients with long QT syndromes (LQTS). However, the role of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) in PKA’s regulation of the HERG channel and its molecular mechanism are not clear. Here, HEK293 cells were transfected with the HERG gene alone or co-transfected with HERG and AKAP5 using Lipofectamine 2000. Western blotting was performed to determine HERG protein expression, and immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation were used to assess the binding and cellular colocalization of HERG, AKAP5, and PKA. The HEK293-HERG and HEK293-HERG + AKAP5 cells were treated with forskolin at different concentrations and different time. HERG protein expression significantly increased under all treatment conditions (P < 0.001). The level of HERG protein expression in HEK293-HERG + AKAP5 cells was higher than that observed in HEK293-HERG cells (P < 0.001). Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation indicated that HERG bound to PKA and AKAP5 and was colocalized at the cell membrane. The HERG channel protein, AKAP5, and PKA interacted with each other and appeared to form intracellular complexes. These results provide evidence for a novel mechanism which AKAP5 anchors PKA to up-regulate the HERG channel protein.

Abstract: Molten binary chloride salts are considered as promising heat transfer and storage mediums in a Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) Station. The properties of them over the entire operating temperature are required to be calculated, since they are difficult to be measured under high-temperature conditions. Reliable numerical method is an alternative tool to accurately predict thermal properties of molten salts from the viewpoint of micro-structure. Based on the effective Born-Mayer-Huggins (BMH) pair potential model, the local structures and thermodynamic properties of lithium-potassium chloride were computed by using Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) and the results are consistent with available experimental literature data. The simulation results prove that BMH force field is reasonable to be adopted to predict the properties of various molten chloride salts and their mixtures. The minimum errors of thermal properties above are all within 11.1%, which is accurate and reliable. The results show that Li+ promotes the diffusion of the system efficiently. In addition, the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity are significantly improved with the increase of Li+. The database of thermal properties and structures of this work are significant for accurate design of material structure and regulation of thermal storage system performance.

Abstract: In this study, we used computational and experimental studies to understand a halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) reactor for growing Gallium Antimonide Phosphide (GaSbyP1-y) films. The computational model is developed for an HVPE reactor having one heating zone for precursor formation and a second zone for film deposition. The first zone is assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. The deposition is modeled using a chemistry set describing various gas phase and gas-solid kinetics. As a case study, the growth of the novel GaSbyP1-y alloy was modeled and the effect of different variables i.e. substrate temperature and system pressure were evaluated. The predicted values for the growth rate are in good agreement with the ones obtained experimentally and other important features such as the crystalline quality and degree of Sb incorporation were correlated with the deposition temperature. The type of photoelectrochemical activity confirms the GaSbyP1-y alloys can be used as photoanodes for water splitting and at low applied biases over-perform a sulfur-doped commercial GaP, however, surface charge transfer kinetics need to be optimized.

Abstract: High-entropy alloys films with the composition of MoNbHfZrTiN and MoNbHfZrTiON are fabricated by a reactive RF magnetron sputtering, which have a good solar spectral selectivity and are used for solar thermal absorption coatings. By changing the flow rate of Ar/N2/O2, the metallic content of each layer of the coatings can be controlled, which forms the MoNbHfZrTiN layer with high metallic content and the MoNbHfZrTiON layer with low metallic content. By tailoring the deposition parameters, a novel Al/MoNbHfZrTiN/MoNbHfZrTiON/SiO2 coating has been successfully deposited on SS substrate for the purpose of shifting the absorption edge to the higher wavelength. The coating exhibits a high absorptance of 0.935 and a low emittance of 0.09. The colors and optical properties of layer-added coatings are studied, and the color coordinates are drawn in the chromaticity diagram. By controlling the thickness of MoNbHfZrTiON and SiO2 layers, the colored Al/MoNbHfZrTiN/MoNbHfZrTiON/SiO2 coatings are fabricated.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) can be transformed into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). This phenomenon represents a potential method for rescuing damaged myocardia after myocardial infarction. The mechanism underlying cardiac reprogramming regulation must be clarified to improve the induction efficiency of iCMs. In this study, we treated CFs with 5-aza for 24 h and added TGF-β inhibitor A83-01 for 2 weeks in vitro to investigate the effect of inhibiting fibrosis on myocardial differentiation. Inhibition of TGF-β1 activity with A83-01 significantly decreased the expressions of collagen III and α-SMA and increased the expression of myocardial specific marker cTnT and gap junction protein Cx43 in CFs, enhanced cardiac reprogramming as opposed to 2 weeks with 5-aza alone. Transcriptome and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis at the 14th day postinduction of A83-01 revealed that the expression of genes involved in cardiac development increased in the presence of 5-aza. These findings suggest that the addition of A83-01 remarkably inhibits profibrotic signalling and improved the efficiency of iCMs, provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cardiac reprogramming and promote the use of iCMs in clinical applications.

Abstract: Satellites in lower earth orbits have been primarily powered by photovoltaic modules. With growing power demand for new satellite concepts, solar cells are required to be flexible and ultra-lightweight to decrease launch costs. CIGS thin film solar technology is a promising candidate, since it can be manufactured on flexible substrates and possesses high radiation hardness. Poor radiative properties of CIGS on the other hand, lead to high temperatures and therefore power loss. High emissivity coatings on CIGS have already been reported but the influence on thermal and electrical aspects have not been addressed. Here we present the optical properties of silicon-oxycarbonitride coatings and their effect on electrical parameters on CIGS cells to be used for the DLR's GoSolAr power sail mission. We show that the single layer coating can significantly increase emissivity from 0.3 to 0.72, with minimal spectral losses and negligible impact on the functioning of the underlying CIGS cell. We simulated the thermal impact of the coating on solar cells in orbit and can predict that the maximum temperature of the cells is reduced by 30 °C, resulting in a significant power gain. Additionally, the coating has an emissivity of 0.87 in the atmospheric window of 8–13 μm making it a very good passive radiative cooler for terrestrial solar cells. The low-cost coating can replace glass and the process can be scaled up for large CIGS modules. The coating can also significantly increase the power to mass ratio of solar modules, reducing costs for space applications.

Abstract: Photoelectrochemical water splitting has been considered one of the most promising alternatives for the substitution of fossil fuels with a clean and renewable fuel, such as H2. Two of the most studied photocatalysts for such application are titanium dioxide and strontium titanate due to their favourable photoactivity, robustness and availability; although specific limitations have hindered their large-scale implementations. In this investigation, we produced photoanodes comprising heterojunctions of TiO2 nanotubes and lanthanum-doped SrTiO3 for the photoelectrochemical split of water, under simulated solar irradiation. A thin layer of SrTiO3 formed on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes through a hydrothermal route was effective in promoting the electron-hole separation at the interface, leading to a photocurrent density enhancement from 58.9 to 109.4 μA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs RHE). The charge transfer resistance at the solid/liquid interface was substantially reduced, according to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Further photoactivity increase was achieved by doping the SrTiO3 overlayer with La3+. This is the first time the application of such La:SrTiO3/TiO2 nanocomposite in sustainable energy production is reported. The doping with 10 mol% of La3+ into the Sr2+ sites enhanced the photoelectrochemical response to 144.2 μA cm−2 (1.23 V vs RHE) due to the suppression of deep trapping states related to formed SrO species.

Abstract: Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is a widely accepted part of the conditioning regimen applied in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to prevent graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Although weight-based dosing of ATG has been introduced to optimize ATG dosing, substantial variance in clearance of active ATG, the actual lymphocyte binding component, remains a challenge. Therefore, further research regarding ATG pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in different HSCT settings and in patients with different types of underlying diseases is required.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease are common infectious complications after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related gene A (MICA) is a ligand of the natural killer (NKG2D) receptor on immune effector cells that helps mediate NK cell alloreactivity. We hypothesized that MICA polymorphisms may influence CMV infection and disease incidence after alloHCT.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 423 adults at the Cleveland Clinic with hematologic malignancies treated with a matched related or unrelated donor alloHCT. CMV cases analyzed included a compositive of instances of viral copy replication above detection limits as well as any biopsy-proven tissue invasive disease episodes. Genotypes at the MICA-129 position have been categorized as weak (valine/valine; V/V), intermediate (methionine/valine; M/V), or strong (methionine/methionine; M/M) receptor affinity.
Results
In multivariable analysis, V/V donor MICA-129 genotype was associated with CMV infection and disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.96; p = .05), but not MICA mismatch (HR = 1.38; 95% CI, 0.83–2.29; p = .22). There was no association of acute or chronic GVHD with MICA donor–recipient mismatch (HR = 1.05; 95% 95% CI, 0.66–1.68; p = .83 and HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.51–1.76; p = .85, respectively) or V/V donor MICA-129 genotypes (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.79–1.31; p = .89 and HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.65–1.22; p = .47, respectively).
Conclusion
These findings suggest that the donor MICA-129 V/V genotype with weak NKG2D receptor binding affinity is associated with an increased risk of CMV infection and disease after alloHCT.

Abstract: Interfacial solar steam generation is an eco-friend and energy-efficient way of harvesting solar energy for desalination and wastewater treatment. For the solar steam generation, the primary focus is to design new materials that are fully sunlight absorption, fast photothermal conversion and low heat emissivity. Here, a novel hollow copper sulfide (CuS) nanocubes with concave surface is used for rapid and efficient solar steam generation through the micro thermal management. Interestingly, the emissivity of CuS foam is as low as 0.64, whose absorption is more than 97% and strongly dependents on the structure and morphology. The unique concave structure of hollow CuS can trap the sunlight by reabsorption as well as recover radiative and convective heat loss. As a result, the CuS based generator exhibits a high evaporation efficiency of 91.5% under one sun illumination. Furthermore, the device can maintain a stable performance of solar steam generation during the cyclic seawater desalination. The novel structure design based on the micro thermal management offers a new insight into the future development of highly efficient solar steam generation.

Abstract: Saharan silver ants can inhabit one of the hottest areas, the Sahara Desert, which benefits from their thermoregulatory functionality, thanks to a sophisticated photonic structure of hairs. Mimicking the photonic structure, we fabricated the flexible hair-like photonic structures on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Attaching them to glass bottles for a proof-of-concept demonstration, the considerably enhanced optical reflection was observed as well as the slightly improved mid-infrared emission. These extraordinary properties enabled the temperature of the glass bottles to be reduced by around 5.6 °C in the hot daytime and keep relatively warm in the cold nighttime. On the basis of optical and thermal properties of the silver ants-inspired photonic structures, potential applications could be further found in wearable devices and personal thermal management.

Abstract: The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively well established, but much less is known about the role(s) of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) mediates inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling in CKD via the transcription factor Smad3; however, the extent of lncRNAs-based regulation of TGF-β1 signaling in CKD remains unknown. Herein, we identified np_4334, a lncRNA we named Ptprd-IR, whose promoter contains a highly-conserved site for Smad3 binding. Smad3 knockout (KO) eliminated Ptprd-IR upregulation in a murine model of obstructive nephropathy. Furthermore, Ptprd-IR KO in renal tubular epithelial cell cultures blocked TGF-β1- and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-mediated NF-κB inflammatory signaling but did not impact TGF-β1-triggered Smad3 pathway activity and fibrosis. Accordingly, Ptprd-IR overexpression (OE) upregulated TGF-β1- and IL-1β-mediated NF-κB pathway activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines but did not influence TGF-β1-mediated fibrogenic signaling. Additionally, transfection of obstructed kidneys with Ptprd-IR-directed shRNA attenuated the inflammatory response via NF-κB but did not impact TGF-β1/Smad3-mediated fibrogenesis. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the lncRNA Ptprd-IR stimulates the inflammatory response in kidneys and advocate Ptprd-IR as a possible therapeutic target for CKD.

Abstract: Herein, we report the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol as a model chlorinated phenolic compound on exfoliated graphite-cerium(IV) oxide (EG-CeO2) photoelectrode. The EG-CeO2 nanocomposites with and without trimethoxymethylsilane (TMOMS) were synthesized using impregnation ultrasonic agitation and comprehensively characterized by XRD, FTIR, Raman, TGA, DSC, FESEM, TEM, EDS, UV–Vis DRS, BET, XPS, and AFM. The SEM results revealed that the CeO2 material was entrapped within the cavities and on the surface of EG sheets. Electrochemical studies were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol dissolved in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte was performed with chronoamperometric technique. The EG-CeO2 (TMOMS) displayed higher removal efficiency under simulated light compared to EG and EG-CeO2, respectively. The degradation efficiency of 98.7% was attained with EG-CeO2 (TMOMS) under optimum conditions of pH 6.2 and current density of 8 mA cm−2. Total organic carbon removal of about 92.6% was recorded during the degradation of 2,4-DCP under optimum conditions for 180 min. Based on the results obtained, the low-cost EG-CeO2 (TMOMS) photoelectrode has lent itself into possibility of photoelectrocatalytic degradation of organic water pollutants and can be extended to environmental samples application.

Abstract: As a promising photocatalytic material, g-C3N4 has drawn tremendous research interest. However, the fast charge recombination and narrow range of solar absorption restrain its practical application. Herein, for the first time, based on extensive hybrid functional calculations, graphyne (Gyne), a new two dimensional material, is used to form a layered vdW-nanohybrid with g-C3N4 to enhance the photoelectrocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. A comprehensive theoretical study of interfacial properties of g-C3N4/Gyne heterostructure including the band structure, partial density of state, optical absorption, wave functions, charge density difference, band alignment and photocurrent density is acquired to provide deep insight into the photocatalytic performance. The calculated results show that g-C3N4/Gyne heterostructure exhibits tremendous photocatalytic performance as that of recently experimentally synthesized Gyne family based nanocomposite, g-C3N4/graphdiyne (g-C3N4/GDyne). The designed g-C3N4/Gyne heterostructure has a fourfold increase in photocurrent density (0.937 μA/mm2) compared with that of g-C3N4 (0.233 μA/mm2). More importantly, the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4/Gyne can be further improved by doping 2BN-pairs into Gyne layer. Theoretical prediction indicates that g-C3N4/2BN-Gyne even realizes a sevenfold increase in photocurrent density (1.669 μA/mm2) due to the type II band alignment, broadened light absorption range and much smaller effective mass, providing helpful physical mechanism information for further optimizing the optoelectronic properties of g-C3N4/GDyne and g-C3N4/Gyne. Our theoretical work provides stepping stone into the design of highly efficient g–C3N4–based photocatalysts and a fully coherent picture about the interfaces of g-C3N4/GDyne and g-C3N4/Gyne heterostructures can also be obtained.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) store or release thermal energy during phase-changing processes, but their practical applications are limited by inherent deficiencies such as leakage over melting point, low thermal conductivity, and single driving way. We propose a novel strategy to prepare a shape-stabilized PCM with enhanced thermal conductivity and efficient electric-thermal/light-thermal energy conversion by encapsulating polyethylene glycol (PEG) in composite scaffolds of boron nitride (BN) and graphene oxide in situ reduced by microwave irradiation (rGO). The resulting composite PCM exhibited high thermal conductivity (1.06 W m−1 K−1 at 14.4 wt% of BN an enhancement of 240% compared with pure PEG), high energy storage density, excellent shape stability and reusability. Furthermore, rGO also endows the PCM with high electric-thermal conversion efficiency (up to 87.9%) and light-thermal conversion efficiency (up to 87.4%), granting it great potential in thermal storage and management fields.

Abstract: A scalable photoelectrochromic (PEC) glass which can be darkened on exposure to sunlight and return to its original clear state in the absence of sunlight without any expensive materials like ruthenium dye or transparent conductive oxide was fabricated. The PEC glass is composed of light absorbing layer of ligand attached titanium oxide, color changing layer of tungsten oxide and the electrolyte containing redox mediator. This work reports, for the first time, on an application of salicylic acid attached TiO2 photoactive layer for PEC devices. The applicability of various salicylic acid derivatives attached TiO2 films in PEC device is individually investigated in dye solar cells. Among various salicylic acid derivatives studied, 5-methylsalicylic acid showed the best performance in terms of charge generation for coloration of WO3. By using 5-methylsalicylic acid instead of ruthenium dye, lower cost, higher stability, and simpler electrolyte composition have been realized. The changes in transmittance for coloration (ΔTC) depend on the thickness of WO3 and TiO2 in this device. Thus, we changed the thickness of WO3 and TiO2 to get the highest variation of transmittance for coloration. The preliminary optimization of PEC device exhibits ΔTC of 40.8% at 550 nm, the wavelength most sensitive to the human eye, and of 64.3% at 700 nm.

Abstract: The development of a textile that cools skin both in sunshine and in room can not only protect the human body from a severely hot working environment but also save energy by lowering air conditioner load. Herein, we have developed a concept that combines solar energy reflection and “passive radiative cooling” for strengthening both solar energy blocking and heat dissipation through long-wave infrared (LWIR) radiation at wavelengths of 8–13 μm. The current technique is achieved by coating a textile with an Al2O3 dispersed-cellulose acetate. Cellulose acetate possesses high emissivity in the LWIR region, which can promote effective LWIR radiation (2.5–25 μm). Al2O3 has a high thermal conductivity (30–40 W m−1 K−1) and can enhance solar energy reflectivity. By coating Al2O3-cellulose acetate, solar energy reflectivity of the textile significantly increases from 62.6% to 80.1% (0.3–2.6 μm). A cooling performance experiment reveals that this modified textile can reduce the temperature of simulated skin by 2.3–8 °C compared to that of an unmodified reference. Furthermore, in a real-life cooling performance experiment, a modified T-shirt can avoid the overheating of actual human skin by 0.6–1.0 °C, corresponding to a temperature decrease by 1.9–3.3 °C for the internal surface of the textile. This work provides a method for the design and synthesis of radiative cooling textiles for personal thermal management.

Abstract: We report nanometer-scale hole-density imaging in As-doped CdTe films by scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM). The hole-density profiling is validated by contrasting a CdTe cross-section sample made by molecular-beam epitaxy with systematically increased As doping in a staircase pattern over the range of 1015–1018/cm3 within a single film. In polycrystalline films, the carrier distribution is significantly nonuniform, with inhomogeneity ranging from several hundred nm to several μm and hole density varying by one order of magnitude (low 1016 to low 1017/cm3). This nonuniformity is distributed randomly, independent of the grain structure and grain boundaries (GBs). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) maps the surface potential and is correlated to cathodoluminescence (CL) and SCM by imaging over identical areas. Higher potential and lower CL intensity are found on GBs but not by SCM contrast; this indicates positive GB charging and recombination, but not GB-specific hole-density changes. The overall KPFM potential image is in rough agreement with the SCM carrier distribution and indicates band-edge potential fluctuations. Nonuniform carrier concentration, potential fluctuations, and defect recombination can all cause voltage and performance loss in As-doped CdTe solar technology.

Abstract: Polysulphide has proven to be an efficient electrolyte for QDSSC, but at the cost of corroding the counter electrode and degrading the sensitizer due to its high redox potential. In this view for the first time, we have used oxide nanoceramics as low cost, easily processable and highly porous solid-state electrolytes for QDSSCs. High residual porosity and formation of liquid phase nanodomains across grain boundaries have added advantages for adsorption and diffusion in these hole transport layer. Yttria stabilized zirconia and ceria co doped yttria stabilized zirconia are the two solid state electrolytes designed in place of polysulphide. Dopants namely Y3+ and Ce4+ in ZrO2 induces defects, oxygen vacancies and band shifts resulting in good charge transport. The interfaces and charge transfer kinetics suggests, recombination resistance offered by these ceramics avoid the back electron transfers via the downward shift of valence band (VB) much closer to that of sensitizer and also act as barriers (or passivation layer) to effectively suppress electron recombinations, resulting in high stability and Voc of the device. Devices designed with these new HTLs show efficiencies on par with polysulphide; they are extremely stable for almost up to 60 days (in ambient conditions), while cells fabricated with polysulphide electrolyte tend to degrade the device within 5 days.

Abstract: Latent thermal energy storage plays an indispensable role in exhaust heat recycles in various industries which is useful for reducing energy consumption. Different phase change temperatures and high thermal conductivities of composite phase change materials were required for various domains. In the present work, Alum as phase change material and Ala as melting point modifier, a series of phase change materials with adjustable melting temperatures were prepared by physical mixing method. Moreover, EG as porous skeleton and thermal conductive enhancer, composite with high thermal conductivity was obtained with simple physical adsorption method. The XRD and SEM were applied to characterize the phase crystal and microstructure of the composite phase change material. DSC results revealed that phase change temperatures of Alum-Ala mixtures could be adjustable from 91.11 °C to 74.61 °C and thermal conductivity of the composite was improved to 10.93 W·m−1·K−1, which is 21.9 times of pristine Alum-Ala mixture. The infrared thermography and temperature-time curves were obtained to represent the heat transfer performance and the subcooling degree intuitively. The subcooling degree was decreased from 2.238 K to 1.866 K. The result of TGA indicated that the composite possessed favorable thermal stability during the operating temperature. From the result, the composite obtained in the present work is a prospective candidate for exhaust heat recycles.

Abstract: Recent photoluminescence and admittance spectroscopy measurements point towards the defect responsible for Light-Induced Degradation (LID) being a shallow level. Dopant dependent lifetime spectroscopy and temperature dependent lifetime spectroscopy on the other hand reveal the existence of a deep level driving the recombination activity of the LID defects. There is an apparent disagreement between admittance spectroscopy results and lifetime spectroscopy results. Here we overcome this apparent disagreement and we show that a negative-U defect with one shallow level can explain both the doping dependent lifetime data and injection dependent data. The critical consequence of this model is that it readily explains the dependence of the LID defect on the hole concentration rather than the Boron concentration.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Cisplatin is an essential drug treating patients with BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations. Whether other genetic determinants of cisplatin sensitivity exist and their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine METTL14 expression in pancreatic cancer tissues and non-tumoural tissues. Cell proliferation was detected with CCK-8 assays. Apoptosis was analysed via Western blotting and flow cytometry, and autophagy was analysed via Western blotting and immunofluorescence. In this work, we found higher METTL14 expression in pancreatic cancer tissues than in non-tumoural tissues, and METTL14 expression was associated with pathological characteristics. Downregulation of METTL14 with siRNA sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to cisplatin. Specifically, apoptosis and autophagy were significantly enhanced in METT14 knockdown cells compared with control cells after treatment with cisplatin. Mechanistically, the AMPKα, ERK1/2 and mTOR signalling pathways were disturbed by downregulation of METTL14. We further found that METTL14 knockdown-mediated autophagy was dependent on mTOR signalling and that mTOR activation decreased autophagy to the level observed in the control group. Collectively, our results indicate that METTL14 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer, downregulation of METTL14 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to cisplatin by enhancing apoptosis, and autophagy is improved via an mTOR signalling-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Efficient energy band alignment of heterojunction layers in colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based solar cells is a crucial factor to govern the charge transport characteristics and device performance. In this work, we develop novel cascaded-junctions of lead sulfide (PbS) CQD triple layers consisting of an alkylammonium iodide (AMI)-treated PbS bilayer and a 1,3-propanedithiol (PDT)-treated single layer. The two AMIs, i.e. triethylamine hydroiodide (tri-EAHI) and tetraethylammonium iodide (TEAI), are less hindered and have superior passivation performance compared to tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), the most commonly used AMI. In addition, the band positions of the PbS-TEAI and PbS-tri-EAHI layers are deeper by 0.26 and 0.46 eV, respectively, than those of the PbS-PDT layer, and hence the sequential stacking of these three layers enable an effective cascaded band alignment. The various benefits of the improved band alignment such as increased built-in potential, reduced trap states, widened depletion region, enhanced charge transport and suppressed charge recombination lead to a significant improvement in the device parameters, and the best power conversion efficiency of 10.46% is obtained for the cascaded PbS-tri-EAHI/PbS-TEAI/PbS-PDT-based device.

Abstract: The surface passivation strategy is one of the effective ways to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of quantum dots-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). In this work, a novel ZnS/SiO2 coating serves as the passivation layers for the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells based on zinc titanium mixed metal oxides (MMOs) obtained from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursor. The incorporation of passivation layers effectively improved the performance of the corresponding CdS/CdSe quantum dots co-sensitized solar cells and the best PCE of 4.91% has been achieved, which represents an over 55% improvement than that of devices without passivation. The effects of ZnS/SiO2 double passivation layers were systematically investigated, especially by 2D time-resolved fluorescence imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique. It was revealed that the existence of ZnS/SiO2 outer layers caused the suppression of charge recombination, higher electrons collection efficiency, and superior surface quality.

Abstract: ETS domain-containing protein-1 (ELK1) is a transcription factor important in regulating αvβ6 integrin expression. αvβ6 integrins activate the profibrotic cytokine Transforming Growth Factor β1 (TGFβ1) and are increased in the alveolar epithelium in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a disease associated with aging and therefore we hypothesised that aged animals lacking Elk1 globally would develop spontaneous fibrosis in organs where αvβ6 mediated TGFβ activation has been implicated. Here we identify that Elk1-knockout (Elk1−/0) mice aged to one year developed spontaneous fibrosis in the absence of injury in both the lung and the liver but not in the heart or kidneys. The lungs of Elk1−/0 aged mice demonstrated increased collagen deposition, in particular collagen 3α1, located in small fibrotic foci and thickened alveolar walls. Despite the liver having relatively low global levels of ELK1 expression, Elk1−/0 animals developed hepatosteatosis and fibrosis. The loss of Elk1 also had differential effects on Itgb1, Itgb5 and Itgb6 expression in the four organs potentially explaining the phenotypic differences in these organs. To understand the potential causes of reduced ELK1 in human disease we exposed human lung epithelial cells and murine lung slices to cigarette smoke extract, which lead to reduced ELK1 expression andmay explain the loss of ELK1 in human disease. These data support a fundamental role for ELK1 in protecting against the development of progressive fibrosis via transcriptional regulation of beta integrin subunit genes, and demonstrate that loss of ELK1 can be caused by cigarette smoke.

Abstract: Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder, the pathogenic factors of which include the decreased ability of osteogenesis and enhanced osteolysis. Human-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) possess the differential capacity to osteoblasts and chondrocytes, so the application of hMSCs in bone tissue is promising to be effective. A group of RNAs which lack of 5′ and 3′ends called circular RNAs (circRNAs) were discovered. In this study, we described a previously found circular RNA, circ_0076906, to bind miR-1305 and regulate its target gene, Osteoglycin (OGN), thus regulate osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and alleviate the progression of osteoporosis. Osteogenic differentiation induced in hMSCs; qRT-PCR and western blot to examine the expressions of mRNAs and proteins; Alkaline phosphatase activity and Alizarin red staining to examine bone formation; luciferase report experiments to detect the interaction between molecules; and the nuclear/cytoplasm separation of cells. 1. Circ_0076906 was induced in osteogenic differentiation; 2. Circ_0076906 silencing inhibited osteogenesis-related genes in hMSCs; 3. Circ_0076906 acted as a sponge for miR-1305; 4. MiR-1305 regulated OGN expression; 5. Circ_0076906 induced-osteogenic differentiation depended on miR-1305/ OGN pathway. Circ_0076906 relieved osteoporosis and promoted osteogenic differentiation through the miR-1305/ OGN pathway.

Abstract: Objectives/background
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a heterogeneous disease in terms of clinical course and response to therapy. Epigenetic changes are the primary mechanism of MDS pathogenesis. FOXO3 and CHEK2 genes play significant roles in normal cellular mechanisms and are also known as tumor suppressor genes. We aimed to clarify the correlation of epigenetic changes in these genes with clinicopathologic findings in MDS.
Methods
A total of 54 newly diagnosed MDS patients referred to Shariati and Firouzgar Hospitals (Tehran, Iran) were included in the study from 2013 to 2015, comprising the following cases: 26 with refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, 10 with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, four refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1), 11 refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2), and three MDS associated with isolated deletion (5q-). Risk groups were determined according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). The methylation status of CHEK2 and FOXO3 promoters were determined by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting analysis of sodium bisulfite-converted DNA. Expressions of CHEK2, FOXO3, and GAPDH were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and fold changes were calculated using the ΔΔCT method.
Results
Statistical analysis revealed no promoter methylation of CHEK2 and FOXO3 in healthy control specimens. FOXO3 promoter methylation was associated with high-risk World Health Organization subgroups (p = .017), high-risk IPSS-R (p = .007), high-risk cytogenetics (p = .045), and more than 5% blasts in bone marrow (p = .001). CHEK2 promoter methylation was correlated with more than 5% blasts in bone marrow (p = .009).
Conclusions
Promoter methylation of CHEK2 and especially FOXO3 is associated with adverse clinicopathological findings and disease progression in MDS.

Abstract: Discarded solution of graphene oxide's fabrication via Hummers' method was recycled for the synthesis of TiO2 photocatalyst on carbon fiber cloth. The composite photocatalyst exhibited a high surface area of 497 m2 g−1, and a production rate of 83.88 μmol g−1 h−1 in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4. The acidity, oxidability and complicated cation specimen of the discarded solution, which was meant to be hazardous to the environment, have been made full use of to facilitate such highly dense, 1D and anatase TiO2 nanorods on carbon fiber.

Abstract: Light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) can have a severe impact on the carrier lifetime of silicon substrates used in solar cell production and thus remains a crucial challenge for manufacturers. In this work, we introduce a two-step annealing process to mitigate LeTID in multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) solar cells. We demonstrate that the first annealing step (450 °C) with a slow belt speed (0.5 m/min) plays a primary role in mitigating LeTID in the cells, but also results in an increase in contact resistance. The application of a second annealing step at a similar temperature (400–500 °C) with a faster belt speed (1.4 m/min) recovers the contact resistance whilst maintaining the stability of the cell. Applying this approach to the p-type mc-Si PERC solar cells resulted in a reduction of efficiency loss during light soaking from ~6%rel (control) to ~1%rel (treated sample). This finding is significant for p-type mc-Si solar cell manufacturers, as the process can be applied to finished cells using a standard belt firing furnace to stabilise cell efficiency for long term operation in the field.

Abstract: Generally, TiO2-based perovskite solar cell (PSC) is beneficial to high efficiency but poor ultraviolet (UV) light stability. Here, we report that a highly efficient MgxZn1-xO-based (MZO-based) PSC with excellent UV light stability. MZO has a higher electron mobility and deeper conduction band than traditional TiO2, which can reduce the charge accumulation at the MZO/perovskite interface and enhance the charge transfer from perovskite to MZO. Furthermore, the reduced interface loss and energy barrier are beneficial to obtain high open-circuit voltage (Voc). By optimizing, the MZO-based device shows a high Voc of 1.11 V, yielding a promising efficiency of 19.57%. The MZO-based device (unencapsulated) retains 76% of its initial short-circuit current density (Jsc) after 1 year air aging (room temperature, relative humidity: 40–80%) and 8 h UV irradiation (365 nm, 35 W), versus only 12% under the same condition for TiO2-based device. The good UV light stability of MZO-based device can be attributed to the reduced electron trap-state density in MZO electron-transporting layer (ETL). Specifically, zinc interstitial and oxygen vacancy mediated defect sites of MZO ETL are effectively passivated, which tightly protects the perovskite layer from degradation under UV light. Our results show a great potential for MZO ETL application in UV-stable PSC.

Abstract: A simple yet effective method based on hot-pressing a free-standing carbon film onto adjacent hole transport layer (HTL) is used to fabricate carbon electrode for planar perovskite solar cells (C–PSCs). Due to the thermoplasticity of as-prepared carbon film, the conductivity of the carbon electrode is enhanced by over ten-fold and the adhesion to adjacent layer is dramatically strengthened via this hot-pressing process. By optimizing the pressing temperature, 15.3% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) is obtained for CuSCN based C–PSCs, which is 70% high than the device without heating at the same pressing pressure. The device demonstrates 93% performance retention after being stored in a humid environment (55–70%) without encapsulation over 80 days. This facile fabrication process of PSCs paves a way to facilitate commercialization of the new PV technology.

Abstract: Direct-absorption solar collectors (DASCs) that employ plasmonic nanofluids with engineered optical properties have drawn much attention for solar thermal applications. One of the major issues limiting further development of DASCs is the long-term dispersion of nanoparticles within the plasmonic nanofluids, which should be sustainable at high-temperature conditions. In this research, we propose surface-modified metal@SiO2 core/shell nanoparticles (CSNPs) to improve the dispersion stability and tune the absorption coefficient of nanofluids. The Au@SiO2 and Ag@SiO2 CSNPs are synthesized using a low-temperature two-step solution process. The plasmonic nanofluids with the synthesized metal@SiO2 CSNPs exhibit excellent dispersion stability of 93.7% for Au@SiO2 and 100% for Ag@SiO2 in 6 months without using any surfactants, and they also present a good thermal stability after thermal exposure at 150 ∘C for an hour. The absorption and scattering coefficients of a plasmonic nanofluid should be known precisely to properly analyze its photothermal conversion. Here, we also develop a new measurement system to separately determine the absorption and scattering coefficients of nanofluid. The Au@SiO2 CSNPs-dispersed nanofluid is observed to exhibit an extremely low scattering albedo (i.e., ω=0.011) in comparison with that of the Ag@SiO2 CSNPs-dispersed nanofluid (ω=0.3).

Abstract: We report on the effect of electron and proton irradiation on effective minority carrier lifetimes (τeff) in p-type Ge wafers. Minority carrier lifetimes are assessed using the microwave-detected photoconductance decay (μW-PCD) method. We examine the dependence of τeff on the p-type doping level and on electron and proton radiation fluences at 1 MeV. The measured τeff before and after irradiation are used to estimate the minority carriers’ diffusion lengths, which is an important parameter for solar cell operation. We observe τeff ranging from ≈ 50 to 230 μs for Ge doping levels between 1 × 1017 and 1 × 1016 at.cm−3, corresponding to diffusion lengths of ≈ 500–1400 μm. A separation of τeff in Ge bulk lifetime and surface recombination velocity is conducted by irradiating Ge lifetime samples of different thicknesses. The possible radiation-induced defects are discussed on the basis of literature.

Abstract: Elaboration of VO2 films with good thermochromic properties remains a challenge because it is mandatory to avoid other intermediate phases belonging to the vanadium-oxygen system. In this work, we propose vanadium nitride (VN) as a new precursor to obtain thermochromic VO2. VN films were reactively sputter-deposited on Si substrates by using an in-line semi-industrial machine. The films of 175 nm thickness were submitted to an annealing process implemented at different durations at 450 °C. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectrometry were performed for structural characterizations of the oxidized films showing the presence of monoclinic VO2 in a wide range of oxidation time. As the annealing time increased, V2O5 appeared to affect the performance of the oxidized films. The TEM analysis carried out on the oxidized sample for 25 min showed that there is an abrupt interface between VN and VO2. The thermal-induced properties of the studied films were analyzed in terms of their electrical resistance employing a four-point probe method and their emissivity modulation properties by infrared camera. The results showed a thermochromic behavior for the samples oxidized in the range of 15–35 min. On the contrary, the presence of residual VN layers in samples oxidized for less than 15 min and V2O5 in the ones annealed for more than 35 min hindered the thermochromic behavior of these films. Bringing together all the characterization techniques used a phase diagram of VN oxidation was plotted. The results of this work suggest that VN is an interesting new precursor to synthesize thermochromic VO2 films.

Abstract: The inorganic carrier transport layers are robust and stable to the environment compared to the organic hole transport layer (HTL). Here, we report on the fabrication of the halide perovskite solar cells (HaPSCs) employing CuI deposited with ammoniated aqueous solution ink as HTL and explored the material properties and device characteristics. The film morphology of CuI is found to have an influence on the HaP film growth and hence effects on the device parameters. The HaPSC with CuI has demonstrated the power conversion efficiency of ~14.21% with high reproducibility. The capacitance spectra analysis shows that the deep trap states are induced in the perovskite absorber layer. The results obtained from the temperature-dependent open circuit voltage implicates that the recombination activities in the perovskite bulk are dominant. Furthermore, the HaPSC with CuI has revealed better air stability compared to the device with PEDOT:PSS. This work suggests that the CuI processed with aqueous precursor is a promising alternative HTL to PEDOT:PSS for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells as well as in a tandem device.

Abstract: Cation substitution has an important impact on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells. Herein, a significant PCE enhancement of flexible indium-doped CZTSSe solar cells has been achieved by partially substituting Sn4+ with In3+. Systematic measurements indicate that In doping in CZTSSe film effectively improves the crystallinity and carrier concentration of the absorber layer. Meanwhile, the treatment reduces interface recombination and band tailing by passivating deep defects and increases the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cells. By physical analysis, the key parameters for the solar cell diode such as A, J0, Rs and Rsh are significantly improved after In-doping, indicating better PN junction quality. Under the optimal In-doping (x = In/(Sn + In) = 9%), the flexible Cu2ZnSn1-xInx(S,Se)4 solar cell has been successfully obtained with the best efficiency of 7.19% and the Voc enhancement of 62 mV due to reduced Voc deficit and band tailing.

Abstract: Cisplatin is one of the most widely used anticancer agents for patients with tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), but its efficacy is limited by chemoresistance. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a critical role in multiple tumor chemotherapy resistance. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of ROS in cisplatin resistance of TSCC and explore its underlying molecular mechanism in vitro. Our results showed that pre-treatment with ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine reduced cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, autophagy, and apoptosis in TSCC cells. Down-regulation of intracellular ROS attenuated apoptosis and autophagy of TSCC cisplatin-resistant CAL27/CDDP cells by reversing the inhibition of p38MAPK/mTOR pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that down-regulation of intracellular ROS reduces the cytotoxicity of cisplatin by inhibiting apoptosis and autophagy in TSCC cells involving p38MAPK/mTOR mediated pathway. Low intracellular ROS levels may be one of the main mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in TSCC.

Abstract: Objective/background
Retinoblastoma (RB), the most common intraocular malignancy in children, is caused by biallelic inactivation of the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1). We are evaluating the impact of the type of RB1 gene mutation on clinical presentation and management outcome.
Methods
A retrospective case series of 50 patients with RB. Main outcomes were clinical and pathologic features and types of RB1 gene mutations detected using quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allele-specific PCR, next-generation sequencing analysis, and Sanger sequencing.
Results
Twenty (40%) patients had unilateral RB and 30 (60%) had bilateral RB. Overall, 36 (72%) patients had germline disease, 17 (47%) of whom inherited the disease. Of these 17 inherited cases, paternal origin of the RB1 mutation was seen in 15 (88%). The overall eye salvage rate was 74% (n = 49/66; 100% for Groups A + B + C, and 79% for Group D eyes). The most frequent type of mutation was a nonsense mutation generating a stop codon (15/36, 42%). Other mutations that result in a premature stop codon due to deletions or insertions with donor splice site or receptor splice site mutations were detected in 7/36 (19%), 10/36 (28%), and 2/26 (6%) patients, respectively. The remaining two (6%) patients had frameshift mutation. Patients with deletion, acceptor splice site, and frameshift mutations presented with more advanced ICRB (International Classification of Retinoblastoma) stage (75% diagnosed with Group D or E), even though there was no significant difference in eye salvage rate or tumor invasiveness between patients with different types of mutations.
Conclusion
Despite the heterogeneous nature of RB1 gene mutations, tumor stage remains the most important predictive factor for clinical presentation and outcome. Furthermore, acceptor splice site and frameshift mutations are associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis.

Abstract: How to achieve high visible-light transmission meanwhile maintain satisfying solar modulation (ΔTsol) remains a challenge for VO2-based thermochromic smart windows. In this study, Sn dopants exhibit the ability of enhancing the visible transmittance (Tlum) of VO2 films, as a result, endowing the films with excellent thermochromic properties. Sn-doped VO2 films with different Sn contents (0at%, 0.43at%, 0.74at%, 1.73at%, 1.86at%) are prepared via hydrothermal method. The 0.74at% Sn-doped film has a Tlum value about twice that of the undoped film. The improvement of the visible transmittance is rationalized by ellipsometry and optical absorption measurements, in which it is revealed that the Sn dopants reduce the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of VO2 in the VIS-NIR wavelength range, and widen the band gap (Eg). The 0.74at% Sn-doped VO2 film realizes excellent thermochromic performance with the ΔTsol up to ~15.4% and the Tlum reaching ~51.8%. This work demonstrates the unique characteristic of Sn dopants to improve the visible transmittance of VO2 films, suggesting a rational way in optimizing the thermochromic property of VO2.

Abstract: This report aims to explore how Bcl-xL, a Bcl-2 family protein, regulates PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Compared with the Hela cells expressing Parkin alone, co-expression of Bcl-xL significantly inhibited CCCP (Carbonyl cyanide 3- chlorophenylhydrazone)-induced mitochondrial Parkin accumulation and mitophagy. Western blotting analysis illustrated that over-expressed Bcl-xL inhibited CCCP-induced decrease of mitochondrial proteins in Parkin over-expressed cells. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) analyses demonstrated that Bcl-xL inhibited the CCCP-induced translocation of Parkin into mitochondria not by retrotranslocating Parkin from mitochondria to cytoplasm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging revealed in Hela cells that Bcl-xL physically bound with Parkin to form oligomer in cytoplasm, and that Bcl-xL also directly interacted with PINK1 on mitochondria. analysis for HEK293 T cells verified that endogenous Bcl-xL interacted with both endogenous Parkin and PINK1. Collectively, Bcl-xL inhibits PINK1/Parkin- dependent mitophagy by preventing the accumulation of Parkin on mitochondria via two regulation ways: directly binds to Parkin in cytoplasm to prevent the translocation of Parkin from cytoplasm to mitochondria and directly binds to PINK1 on mitochondria to inhibit the Parkin from cytoplasm to mitochondria by PINK1.

Abstract: Slurry iron-aluminide coatings deposited by spraying on 9 wt% Cr P91 alloy as well as uncoated P91 were exposed isothermally at 650 °C to a ternary molten salt mixture based on a Na, K and Li carbonate eutectic, under static and dynamic conditions. Uncoated P91 evidenced considerable mass gains and extensive spallation in both conditions. Indeed, P91 developed a very thick fast growing multilayered oxide scale which included LiFeO2, LiFe5O8 and (Fe,Cr)3O4. Under dynamic conditions, the metal loss was higher that when the test was carried out statically but this was not reflected in the gravimetric measurements likely due to spallation of the scales in both cases. The coated systems performed better than the uncoated material up to at least 1000 h according to metallographic inspection. However, the aluminide coating showed non-uniform attack and on the corresponding zones, a thick layer likely consisting of LiFeO2 developed over an internal oxidation zone corresponding to all of the coating initial thickness. K was also detected within the internal oxidation zone suggesting that the coating was internally attacked at least by K containing species (Li cannot be detected by EDS). K and perhaps Li seem to diffuse along the grain boundaries of the coating, leading to internal oxidation responsible for the degradation. On the non-degraded zones, the coating maintained the initial microstructure as very low coating/substrate interdiffusion occurred. A 20 wt% average Al content at the surface does not seem to be high enough to sustain a protective oxide.

Abstract: Bovine mammary fibrosis represents a considerable health problem of cows, primarily indicated by lactation failure. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can cause mammary damage, this multifactorial disease necessitates to identify how and to what extent molecular pathogen defense mechanisms prevent bacterial infections in bovine mammary gland. In this study, we have aimed to determine the transcriptional responses in bovine mammary fibroblasts (BMFBs) induced by S. aureus using bioinformatics analysis to determine whether mRNA expression profile changes between BMFBs activation and quiescence. Established primary BMFBs obtained from healthy Holstein bovine were induced 106 CFU/mL heat-inactivated S. aureus and total RNA was isolated 6 h after treatment. The 574 DEGs were involved in gene ontology (GO) that were immune response, apoptotic process, extracellular region, receptor binding, endopeptidase activity and protein kinase activity et al. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, distinct pathway contained signaling molecules common to various inflammatory and fibrotic pathways were Pathways in cancer, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The BMFBs was treated with heat-inactivated S. aureus (106 CFU/mL) and also with pharmacological inhibitors of ERK1/2, P38 MAPK and JNK. The MMP-2 activity were examined gelatin zymography, MMP-2, TIMP-1, -2 and PLAU/PAI-1 protein expression were examined in vitro by western blot. The MMP-2 activity was significantly inhibited by simultaneous inhibition of ERK1/2, P38 MAPK and JNK, and MMP-2, TIMP-1,-2 and PLAU/PAI-1 protein expression were significantly decreased by inhibiting ERK1/2, P38 MAPK or JNK. This suggested a crosstalk between the ERK1/2, P38 MAPK or JNK signaling pathways in regulating extracellular matrix metabolism in the BMFBs with S. aureus. Our study complement our initial study on S. aureus-induced responses by fibrosis-associated genes in BMFBs. This may lead to development of novel therapeutic targets to control bovine mammary fibrosis induced by S. aureus.

Abstract: We demonstrate type-II GaAsSb/GaAsN superlattices (SL) as a suitable structure to form the lattice-matched 1.0–1.15 eV subcell that would allow the implementation of the optimum monolithic multi-junction solar cell design. The separation of Sb and N atoms during growth leads to an improved composition homogeneity and a lower defect density than in the bulk GaAsSbN counterparts. The type-II band alignment SLs provide long radiative lifetimes that facilitate carrier collection as compared to equivalent type-I SLs. Moreover, the radiative lifetime can be controllably tuned through the period thickness, which is not possible in type-I SLs. A reduced period thickness results in enhanced absorption due to increased wavefunction overlap, as well as in a change in the transport regime from diffusive to quasiballistic, providing improved carrier extraction efficiency. As a result, the short period SL single-junction solar cells show an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 134% over the equivalent bulk devices.

Abstract: Heterojunction Cu2O solar cells are an important class of Earth-abundant photovoltaics that can be synthesized by a variety of techniques, including electrochemical deposition (ECD) and thermal oxidation (TO). The latter gives the most efficient solar cells of up to 8.1% reported in the literature, but is limited by low external quantum efficiencies (EQE) in the long wavelength range (490–600 nm). By contrast, ECD Cu2O gives higher short wavelength EQEs of up to 90%. We elucidate the cause of this difference by characterizing and comparing ECD and TO films using impedance spectroscopy and fitting with a lumped circuit model to determine the trap density, followed by simulations. The data indicates that TO Cu2O has a higher density of interface defects, located approximately 0.5 eV above the valence band maximum (NV), and lower bulk defect density thus explaining the lower short wavelength EQEs and higher long wavelength EQEs. This work shows that a route to further efficiency increases of TO Cu2O is to reduce the density of interface defect states.

Abstract: In this work, ultra-thin n-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide [(nc-SiOx:H (n)] film was used to replace amorphous silicon [a-Si:H (n)] as electron transport layer (ETL) in rear-junction silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell to reduce front parasitic absorption. The contact resistivity between the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and ultra-thin ETL interface plays an important role on the cell performance. A nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) contact or seed layer was introduced in the solar cell with ultra-thin nc-SiOx:H and the impact of the nc-Si:H thickness on the cell performance was investigated. To demonstrate scalability, bifacial solar cells with 10 nm ETL were fabricated on the M2 (244 cm2) wafer. The best cell performance is obtained by the solar cell with 5 nm nc-SiOx:H (n) and 5 nm nc-Si:H (n) contact layer and it exhibits open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 738 mV, fill factor (FF) of 80.4%, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.0 mA/cm2 and power conversion efficiency (η) of 23.1% on M2 wafer. Compared to the one with nc-SiOx:H (n), an increase of 3%abs of FF and 0.5%abs of η and lower front contact resistivity is demonstrated for the solar cells with nc-Si:H (n) / nc-SiOx:H (n) double layer, which is caused by the lower energy barrier for electrons, according to the band diagram calculated by the AFORS-HET simulator. A simulation on the solar cell optical and electrical losses was done by the Quokka 3 simulator and shows much lower electrical transport loss and a bit higher front surface transmission loss for the one with double layer than nc-SiOx:H (n) single layer.

During GERD episodes, the lower esophageal epithelium is repeatedly exposed to stomach acid, which often contains duodenal bile salts that prompt malignant transformation. TRAIL is one of the cytokines produced in response to such insults and targets the transformed cells exclusively. In this study, we simulated GERD episodes in vitro by exposing the cancer cells to acid or acid/bile combination and found that the cancer cells lived through acid attacks by expression of the decoy receptors and c-FLIPR but died of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis when bile salts were present. Further investigation revealed that acid/bile exposure downregulated the decoy receptors and thereby facilitated TRAIL signaling; meantime, it inhibited protein kinase C activity and thus expedited c-FLIPR degradation, allowing apoptosis to take place.

Abstract: Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems coupled to thermodynamic power cycles capable of generating electrical work are becoming strategic technologies of the future. The efficiency of TES fluids is a function of several thermodynamic and physical properties such as their heat capacity, latent enthalpy of melting and thermal conductivity. The stored thermal energy in these materials can be delivered to heat transfer fluids either by sensible heat or latent heat interactions. Challenges in the design of TES-based technologies are linked to the thermal stability and corrosivity of the selected heat storage fluid that needs to be encapsulated in metallic tubes/containers as well as the heat transfer efficiency. Latent heat storage materials, also known as Phase Change Materials (PCMs) offer high specific heat storage capacity and can operate at a constant temperature if their chemistry is adjusted so that they represent minima on liquidus surfaces. Working at a constant and minimal temperature is highly desirable from an engineering perspective as it limits corrosion degradation and temperature cycling stresses experienced by the container materials. Up to now, the identification of optimal PCMs has been mostly done via experimental trial-and-error based on limited amounts of thermodynamic data. Being able to theoretically identify PCM candidates and fine-tune their thermo-physical behavior would drastically improve their design. We present here an efficient tool specifically developed for the design of PCMs. This tool was used to identify 30 PCM candidates found in high-order anhydrous chloride-based salt systems that can operate at a temperature of 390±10∘ C.

Abstract: In this research work, MXene with a chemical formula of Ti3C2 is used for the first time with silicone oil to improve thermo-physical properties of MXene based silicone oil. This paper focuses on preparation, characterization, thermal properties, thermal stability and performance investigation of new class of silicone oil nanofluids induced with MXene in three different concentrations for a Concentrated Solar Photovoltaic Thermal (CPVT) collector. The thermal conductivity of the silicone oil-based MXene nanofluids is measured using a Transient Hot Bridge (THB) 500. Viscosity is measured using a Rheometer at various temperatures including 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 °C. PerkinElmer Lambda 750 is used to measure optical absorbance. The highest thermal conductivity enhancement is found to be 64% for 0.1 wt% concentration of silicone oil-MXene nanofluid compared to pure silicone oil at 150 °C. The viscosity of MXene with silicone oil nanofluids is found to be independent of addition of MXene nanoparticles in the silicone oil base fluid. Viscosity is reduced by 37% when temperature is raised from 25 °C to 50 °C for different concentrations of MXene with silicone oil. Silicone oil-based MXene nanofluid with 0.1 wt% concentration is thermally stable up to ~380 °C. Introducing more MXene nanoparticles into silicone oil improves electrical efficiency of PV module due to better cooling of MXene based nanofluids. Higher solar concentration is resulted in higher average temperature of the PV module. This consequently raises thermal energy gain which is useful for different applications.

Abstract: With advances in design and manufacturing, the cooling performance of daytime radiative cooling materials has progressively improved. However, there has not been an effective method for comparing the cooling performance of the materials tested in different geographical locations and laboratories. Here, we present a simulation-based method, consisting of the basic radiation theory, the standard solar spectrum, and six standard model atmospheres, for comparing the cooling performance of different daytime radiative cooling materials. The proposed simulation-based comparison method was then used to compare four representative daytime radiative cooling materials selected from the literature. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparing the cooling performance of different radiative cooling materials tested under different environmental conditions. With the proposed comparison method, the engineers can choose the most suitable daytime radiative cooling material for a specific environment.

Abstract: A rapid thermal anneal (RTA) is used to crystallize the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) deposited hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film to form the phosphorus-doped polysilicon passivated contact in tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells. The effects of annealing temperature, annealing time, cooling time, and the polysilicon thickness on the surface passivation are investigated. The primary advantage of the RTA is reducing the whole crystallization period to ~15 min, shorter than the conventional tube-furnace annealing period of >60 min. We find that the RTA is a robust method to prepare high-quality polysilicon passivated contact without introducing blistering when the thickness of the a-Si:H is less than 40 nm. The optimized RTA process leads to an implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 712 mV and a single-sided dark saturation current density (J0,s) of 12.5 fA/cm2 in the as-annealed state, which is inferior to the surface passivation of the controlled one prepared by a tube furnace annealing. Fortunately, a subsequent Al2O3 capping hydrogenation improves the iVoc and J0,s to 727 mV and 4.7 fA/cm2, respectively. The champion conversion efficiency of 23.04% (Voc = 679.0 mV, Jsc = 41.97 mA/cm2 and FF = 80.86%) is achieved, which demonstrates the effectiveness of RTA for preparing a high-efficiency polysilicon passivated-contact solar cell.

Abstract: We focus on utilizing sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) as a recombination layer, having low junction damage to an n-type silicon solar cell with a front-side tunnel oxide passivating electron contact, thereby enabling the development of a high efficiency monolithic perovskite/Si tandem device. High transparency and low resistivity ITO films are deposited via low power DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature onto a front-side thin SiOx/n+ poly-Si contact in a complete Cz n-Si cell with a back-side Al2O3/SiNx passivating boron-diffused p+-emitter on a random pyramid textured surface. We report the cell characteristics before and after ITO sputtering, and we find a cure at 250 °C in air is highly effective at mitigating any sputtering induced damage. Our ITO coated sample resulted in an implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 684.7 ± 11.3 mV with the total saturation current density of 49.2 ± 14.8 fA/cm2, an implied fill factor (iFF) of 81.9 ± 0.8%, and a contact resistivity in the range of 60 mΩ-cm2 to 90 mΩ-cm2. After formation of a local Ag contact to the rear emitter and sputtered ITO film as the front-side contact without grid fingers, the pseudo-efficiency of 20.2 ± 0.5% was obtained with the Voc of 670.4 ± 7 mV and pseudo FF of 77.3 ± 1.3% under simulated one sun with the calculated short-circuit current density of 30.9 mA/cm2 from the measured external quantum efficiency. Our modelling result shows that efficiency exceeding 25% under one sun is practically achievable in perovskite/Si tandem configuration using the ITO recombination layer connecting a perovskite top cell and a poly-Si bottom cell.

Abstract: In this work, modified BET model was applied to obtain phase diagrams and to design new eutectic mixtures. As a result, the eutectic composition and the melting point of two mixtures based on salt hydrates: LiNO3·3H2O–NaNO3–Mn(NO3)2·6H2O and LiNO3·3H2O–Mn(NO3)2·6H2O–Mg(NO3)2·6H2O were predicted. Both mixtures present the same predicted melting temperature of 10.8 °C. Experimental verifications by T-history method showed satisfactory accordance of the predicted temperatures values with a difference of 0 °C and +2.3 °C for the mixtures, with sodium nitrate and magnesium nitrate, respectively. It is added that the thermal and physical properties such as density, the heat capacity for solid and liquid phases, as well as viscosity and volume change during the fusion of the new PCMs were evaluated. The results of the characterization, the energy storage density (about 300 MJ m−3) and material cost estimation show that both mixtures are promising candidates for use in low temperature energy storage systems.

Abstract: Correlation between Urbach energy (EU) and open-circuit voltage deficit (VOC,def) among conventional as well as emerging thin-film solar cells, i.e. Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe), Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe), Cu2SnS3 (CTS), Cu2Sn1-xGexS3 (CTGS), SnS, Cu2ZnSnSxSe4-x (CZTSSe), perovskite (PVK), Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS), and CdTe thin-film solar cells, is examined. The EU is estimated from an exponential tail in a long-wavelength edge of an external quantum efficiency. It is determined that the relation between short-circuit current density (JSC) and EU is not clearly shown because the JSC is primarily influenced by the bandgap of the thin-film absorbers. On the other hand, EU demonstrates a close relation with VOC,def, where the reduction of the EU leads to the decrease in the VOC,def, implying that the EU can be used as an indicator of the absorber quality. The EU of over 20 meV, observed in the CIGS, CTS, CTGS, SnS, and CZTSSe solar cells, gives rise to the high VOC,def and the low conversion efficiency (η) values. The EU of below 20 meV, seen in the CIGSe, CIGSSe, PVK, and CdTe solar cells, leads to the low VOC,def and high η values. Ultimately, the thin-film absorbers with the EU values of below 20 meV, which is lower than thermal energy under room temperature, is of vital to realize high photovoltaic performances.

Abstract: High-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have experienced rapid development and attracted significant attention in recent years. The PSCs based on doctor bladed or slot-die coated perovskite films usually have lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) than that based on spin-coated perovskite films. In this work, we have developed an effective method, called glass rod-sliding and low pressure assisted solution processing composition engineering (GRS-LPASP), to manufacture high quality perovskite film in air. GRS-LPASP composition engineering effectively increases the grain size and thickness of perovskite films and reduces the defect density by increasing the contact area between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer, thus leading an increased current density (Jsc) of perovskite solar cells. The device with GRS-LPASP composition engineering achieves a maximum PCE of 19.78%. The experimental results demonstrates that GRS-LPASP composition engineering is a feasible method to prepare high-efficiency PSCs. Moreover, GRS-LPASP composition engineering also provides a potential approach for the commercial production of PSCs.

Abstract: Background
Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo‐SCT) is an option for patients without human leukocyte antigen‐matched related or unrelated donor. Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is an effective method of graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and permits the use of T‐cell replete grafts in settings were ex vivo manipulation is not feasible.
Methods
A retrospective study among patients younger than 18 years, with a history of hematologic malignancies who underwent haplo-SCT between 2012 and 2016. All patients received a preparative regimen of fludarabine, busulfan, and 400 cGy total body irradiation or melphalan. Post-transplant GvHD prophylaxis consisted either of PTCy (50 mg/kg on Days + 3 and + 4) and cyclosporine (CSA) plus mycophenolate (MMF) (15 mg/kg/dose, thrice daily, per os), or mini-dose methotrexate (MTX; 5 mg/m2 dose) on Days + 5, +7, +10, and + 15.
Results
A total of 52 children were included, whose median age was 9 years (interquartile range, 4.9–14; range, 1.2–17 years), and 63% were males. The most common complications were cytomegalovirus reactivation (57%) and hemorrhagic cystitis (36%). The acute GVHD prophylaxis was PTCy, CSA, and mini-dose MTX in 42 (81%) patients, and 10 (19%) patients received PTCy, CSA, and MMF. The cumulative incidence of acute GvHD II–IV, acute GvHD III–IV, and chronic GvHD were 42%, 8.5%, and 19%, respectively. Grades I–IV acute GvHD occurred in 100% of the patients who received prophylaxis with CSA and MMF, and 62% who received CSA and mini-dose MTX (p = .055). The transplant-related mortality at 100 days was 18%. The 5-year overall and event-free survival were 59% and 57%, respectively.
Conclusions
Haplo‐SCT with PT/Cy can be an available, safe, and feasible option for children with hematologic malignancies; meanwhile, the use of mini-dose of MTX was associated with lower rates of acute GVHD. However, our results require further support from prospective randomized studies to improve the efficacy of this prophylactic strategy.

Abstract: Properties of the electron transport layer (ETL) are known to influence the performance of lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). But so far very little emphasis has been given on the increased impact of this layer at low light. In this work we compare the effect of thickness and coverage of a TiO2 compact layer on the performance and hysteresis of methyl ammonium lead iodide planar devices tested under 200 lux vs. 1 sun illumination. Standard TiO2 layers are produced with incremental thickness and coverage using sequential spray pyrolysis of a Ti-acetylacetonate precursor (0–50 sprays, 1 spray ~ 1 nm TiO2). Thorough materials characterisation combining FEG-SEM, XPS, and cyclic voltammetry shows that a crystalline, nearly pin-hole free TiO2 layer is achieved by deposition of ≥15 sprays over small to large areas (0.2 mm2–1 cm2). Device performance is affected by two main parameters, namely the coverage yield and thickness of the TiO2 layer, especially under 200 lux illumination. A 25 vs. 50 sprays-TiO2 layer is found to provide the best compromise between coverage and thickness and avoid charge recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface whilst minimizing resistive losses with 11.7% average PCE at 200 lux vs 7.8% under 1 sun. Finally, the analysis of I/V forward vs. reverse scans and open circuit voltage decay data suggests that hysteresis is greatly affected by the capacitive properties of the ETL at low light, whilst other phenomena such as ion migrations may dominate under 1 sun.

Abstract: Herein, for the first time, we demonstrated the potential practicability of VO2 (M) as a low cost and stable photoabsorber coated on a piece of poplar wood (W/S8-M) in solar steam generation of Caspian Sea water. The evaporation rate of 3.63 kg m−2 h−1 and the solar steam generation efficiency of 75.60% for W/S8-M were obtained under 3 sun (3 kW m−2) irradiation within 40 min. The concentration of sodium ions in the seawater decreased from 3138.19 to 6.61 mg L−1 for W/S8-M which is far below the drinking water standards. The pH and electrical conductivity of seawater was decreased after desalination by W/S8-M to a large extent. A surfactant-mediated method using different amounts of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used to prepare VO2 (M). It was revealed that the sample prepared by addition of 0.08 g CTAB using hydrothermal method has the smallest particle size of 230 nm, the largest specific surface area of 14.542 m2 g-1, the greatest mean pore size of 43.53 nm, narrow thermal hysteresis width of 4.12 °C, and the lowest semiconductor–metal phase transition temperature of 65.23 °C. For the first time, the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the SMT of VO2 (M) at different temperatures. We found that the samples have the same unique ATR-FTIR spectra below Tc with the characteristic band at 835 and a shoulder at 1020 cm−1 while at T > Tc, the fairly linear curves without any meaningful band are appeared.

Abstract: Carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been a promising candidate in the field of photovoltaics due to its simple preparation process and excellent stability in air with high humidity. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of such cells is still unsatisfactory to this day because of the large energy offset and poor hole extraction at the interface of CsPbBr3/carbon. Here, a MoO2/N-doped carbon nanospheres (NC) composite with high hole mobility and matched energy level is prepared by a facile one-step pyrolysis process and introduced into carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC as a hole-transporting material (HTM) to enhance energy level alignment, interface contact and charge extraction as well as to passivate CsPbBr3 surface defects, realizing the reduction of energy loss and charge recombination. The optimal PSC based on MoO2/NC composite without encapsulation achieves a maximum PCE as high as 9.40% in comparison with 6.68% efficiency for the reference device and exhibits an outstanding long-term stability over 800 h in air atmosphere with 80% relative humidity. This work provides an effective approach to build high-performance and stable all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs by introducing simple synthetic and efficient MoO2/NC composite inorganic HTM.

Abstract: Electron transport layer (ETL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays an important role on transferring electrons from perovskite layer to transparent conductive oxide layer, strongly affecting PSC performance. In the present study, effects of adding graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as a dopant to the mesoscopic TiO2 (mp-TiO2) ETL on performance of a PSC were investigated. Different amounts (1.25, 2.5 and 5 vol%) of GQDs were directly added to the TiO2 precursor solution which was subsequently applied as the doped ETL by spin coating. The results showed that Jsc, Voc and FF of the 2.5 vol% GQDs-doped cell were 21.92 mA/cm2, 0.97 V and 0.63, respectively, corresponding to a PCE of 14.36% (champion cell), approximately 50% improvement compared to the un-doped cells (best PCE 9.55%). The perovskite film in the GQDs-doped cell was dense with fewer pinholes which facilitated electron extraction, and accelerated charge mobility in TiO2 layer, consequently promoting Jsc and Voc. Based on EIS results, GQDs doping into the TiO2 ETL significantly suppressed the recombination processes, resulting in a higher FF. Interestingly, the PSC based on 2.5 vol% GQDs-doped TiO2 ETL maintained ~88% of its initial PCE (champion cell), after 500 h under ambient conditions; whereas, the conventional PSC based on pure TiO2 ETL maintained only 61% of its initial PCE under the same conditions, suggesting a dramatic improvement in the device stability. The findings clearly showed that GQDs doping to TiO2 ETL could be a potential and confident approach for improving performance and stability of the mesoscopic PSCs.

Abstract: The optical modelling for optimizing high-efficiency c-Si solar cells endowed with poly-SiOx or poly-SiCx carrier-selective passivating contacts (CSPCs) demands a thorough understanding of their optical properties, especially their absorption coefficient. Due to the mixed phase nature of these CSPCs, spectroscopic ellipsometry is unable to accurately detect the weak free carrier absorption (FCA) at long wavelengths. In this work, the absorption coefficient of doped poly-SiOx and poly-SiCx layers as function of oxygen and carbon content, respectively, was obtained for wavelengths (300–2000 nm) by means of two alternative techniques. The first approach, photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS), was used for layers grown on quartz substrates and is appealing from the point of view of sample fabrication. The second, a novel inverse modelling (IM) approach based on reflectance and transmittance measurements, was instead used for layers grown on textured c-Si wafer substrates to mimic symmetrical samples. Although the absorption coefficients obtained from these two techniques slightly differ due to the different used substrates, we could successfully measure weak FCA in our CSPCs layers. Using an in-house developed multi-optical regime simulator and comparing modelled reflectance and transmittance with measured counterparts from symmetrical samples, we confirmed that with increasing doping concentration FCA increases; and found that the absorption coefficients obtained from IM can now be used to perform optical simulations of these CSPCs in solar cells.

Abstract: The capabilities of soft x-ray absorption (XAS), soft x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), resonant inelastic soft x-ray scattering (RIXS), and their application to characterization of solar energy materials are presented. We have discussed some recent developments of in-situ soft x-ray spectroscopy cells, which enable the investigation of critical solid/liquid or solid/gas interfaces in chemical and electrochemical processes under real-world practical conditions. In particular, in-situ soft x-ray spectroscopies can be utilized to probe the formation of intermediate species, charge separation upon illumination of sunlight and electron transfer to the interfacial reactions. A number of examples using soft x-ray spectroscopies to study these solar energy and catalytic materials are discussed to demonstrate how these powerful characterization tools could be helpful to further understand the energy conversion and energy storage systems.

Abstract: To enhance the reliability of the thin-film solar cell technologies, it is required to analyze and understand the moisture-induced degradation. In this study, the moisture induced degradation of glass-to-glass CIGS module are comprehensively analyzed. CIGS modules are fabricated and tested under damp-heat conditions with periodical measurement of the electrical characteristics. Individual layers of the module are also investigated experimentally and the moisture induced degradation is discussed. A modified method to extract the diode model parameters from degraded I–V curves is proposed and applied to the degraded data. Finally, the degradation rates are modelled and the effect of model parameters degradation on the power of module are quantitatively compared. It suggests that the power degradation of CIGS module under the damp-heat environment is more affected by the enhanced recombination of the absorber layer than the degradation of the metal layer or the leakage over layers.

Abstract: For screen-printed silicon solar cells, optimization of the contact characteristics between the front metal electrode and silicon is very significant for realizing high efficiency. As technology advances, the solar cell efficiency has been steadily increased. Especially, as surface recombination becomes more important in high efficiency solar cells, understanding and controlling recombination in the metal contact area are necessary. Recombination at the metal-silicon interface is a major cause of the drop in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of a solar cell. Thus far, the study of electrodes in silicon solar cells has been largely aimed at reducing the series resistance, and few studies on recombination due to electrodes have been performed. Quantitatively evaluating the recombination in electrodes to assess the effect on the efficiency is expected to become more important in the near future. In this paper, the contact characteristics of a screen-printed silver electrode and silicon interface were analyzed using saturation current density (Jo) measurements according to the surface doping concentration and firing temperature. The effects of the contact characteristics on Voc and recombination were also investigated. Experimental results showed that Jo.pass decreased with decreasing surface doping concentration and Jo.metal increased with increasing surface doping concentration and firing temperature. For quantitative analysis of Jo.metal, the size and distribution of Ag crystallites were observed using SEM and TEM, and the Ag concentration was analyzed by ICP-OES measurements. The larger Jo.metal was, the higher the Ag crystallite concentration, indicating that the Ag crystallites under the electrode increased Jo.metal. The effect of Jo.metal on the electrical characteristics of the solar cell was analyzed by calculating the change in the surface recombination velocity and the decreased width of Voc. Through this study, the recombination in the metallized area, which is expected to become increasingly important, and particularly the effects of the doping profile of the emitter region and silver crystallites on the surface recombination were quantitatively assessed. The amount of silver crystallites on the silicon wafer was quantitatively analyzed.

Abstract: Titanium oxide (TiO2) is the most commonly employed electron transport layer (ETL) in planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) structure (FTO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag). However, it suffers from defects such as oxygen vacancies and structural defects due to the formation of Ti3+ ions. While defects in TiO2 could play a role in determining the device performance, perovskite layer in PSCs also exhibits traps at interfaces and grain boundaries causing increased recombination losses lowering the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of the devices. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the use of a thin interlayer of [6, 6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) as a passivation layer between TiO2 and perovskite layer in planar PSC structure, as analysed using aging and stability studies. The study reveals that the quality of the interface between the constituent layers improves after introduction of PC60BM as passivation layer thus causing an enhancement in the performance of devices. The performance of the devices showed a peculiar behaviour when measured at different times with ~40% enhancement in PCE after 50 h followed by a drop when measured after 150 h. The initial improvement in the device performance was studied using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy which showed a blue shift in the emission while impedance spectroscopy measurements showed a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance after 50 h, aided by an improved band alignment as suggested by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Further, we show that initiation of degradation in perovskite starts from interface instead of degradation in the bulk of perovskite layer.

Abstract: Aluminium, first surface, plastic mirrors have been developed to be used as heliostats in concentrated solar power stations. The Al reflective layer, the adhesion of the reflective layer to the polycarbonate (PC) substrate and the protective over-coat have all been optimized in order to achieve a highly reflective, robust and durable light-weight mirror. The Al layers were deposited by means of magnetron sputtering and the change in reflectance was investigated as a result of variations in the sputtering conditions. The influence of the substrate cleaning process and the addition of an interfacial seed layer on the adhesion of the reflective layer were also systematically studied. A thick sputtered SiO2 film and a dip-coated transparent hard-coat resin were examined as protective coatings against weathering tests. All prepared samples were characterised using, adhesion and abrasion tests, spectrophotometry, nano-scratch, salt-spray tests and both accelerated and outdoor weathering. The optimal three-layer stack was found to be 15 nm of SiO2 as an adhesive layer, 80 nm of Al as the reflector and 4.5 μm dip-coated, hard-coat resin as the protective layer. The three-layer stack plastic mirror gave an overall total solar weighted specular reflectance of ≈88% which was maintained even after aggressive abrasion tests such as Bayer and Steel Wool, 40 days within a salt-spray chamber and after 5 months under accelerated weathering.

Abstract: Building energy consumption is influenced evidently by solar radiation. To achieve a stable indoor temperature by minimizing the heat fluctuations resulted from solar radiation, latent heat thermal energy storage systems with phase change materials (PCMs) in building envelope have been studied. Though inorganic PCMs have promising potential applications among all kinds of PCMs, the supercooling and segregation are the major issues which have restricted their practical applications. The purpose of this study is to lessen the supercooling degree of an industrial grade PCM (CaCl2·6H2O) by using a nucleating agent - flake graphite. A super absorbent polymer (SAP) was also used as a thickener to prevent segregation of CaCl2·6H2O during phase transition. The combined method of thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA) was firstly proposed to evaluate the segregation of inorganic PCM innovatively. The results showed that using 0.5 wt% flake graphite not only eliminated the supercooling of CaCl2·6H2O, but also improved its thermal conductivity for better thermal performance. The results of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) demonstrated that the flake graphite did play an important role on the crystallization of CaCl2·6H2O. Numerical simulation demonstrated that using modified CaCl2·6H2O within walls of buildings in Hong Kong and Changsha are economically feasible with the payback periods of 18.3 years and 8.4 years respectively.

Abstract: This work describes an approach to direct evaluate the role of selected modifier added over hematite photoanode interfaces for light assisted water splitting. Hematite photoanodes with thickness varying from 25 up to 130 nm were designed via spin coating deposition of polymeric precursor that provides mesoporous planar morphology. The photoelectrochemical data analyzed in terms of global efficiency parameter (ηglobal) revealed a close dependence with hematite thickness for unmodified photoanode, which large number of interfaces associated with high charge recombination rate led to drop the electrode performance. To address this issue and manipulate the large number of interfaces due to the planar morphology, Sn4+ ions (1 and 3% molar ratio) were deposited over the hematite surface leading to enhance the electronic transport with a cost of creation of surface states at the solid-liquid interface. Then, a second modification process was done by photoelectrodeposition of Ni/Fe based material to suppress or minimizing the effect of surface state created by the Sn4+ ions addition. The results show that the interfacial traps were mitigated for the thinner hematite photoanodes, where the presence of Sn4+ and Ni/Fe significantly increases the ηglobal. The present find, highlights the importance of morphology design that allows a combination of modifier insertion to work in synergy for enhancing the overall photoanode performance.

Abstract: Conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) demonstrates potential applications in developing integrated smart energy devices based on the bi-functional electrochromic optical modulation and electrochemical energy storage. One challenge is to improve the structural stability of PANI films in response to repeating doping and dedoping of anions during the electrochemical redox process. Herein, a facile and effective approach is developed for improving the electrochemical performance of PANI by coating onto the carbon nanotube (CNT) conductive networks. The introduction of CNT firstly provides multiple directions for electron transfer and thus enhances the charge capacity of PANI. Then, the polymerization of PANI onto the CNT (PANI@CNT) contributes to the formation of a 3D network film, which effectively reduces the structural failure caused by anions intercalation and extraction. Compared with compact PANI film, a substantial promotion of bi-function achieves in the porous PANI@CNT one, whose optical transmittance modulation increases to over 40% and the specific capacitance of the initial cycle is almost tripled. On the basis of reversible and stable chromatic transitions between different charged states, the PANI@CNT electrode is further developed to be a smart electrochromic supercapacitor exhibiting visual energy storage level. We expect that this work may lead to new designs of robust smart energy storage devices.

Abstract: In this study, we synthesized molten salt nanofluids by dispersing spherical SiO2 nanoparticles at a minute concentration (1 wt%) into a binary mixture of NaNO3-KNO3. The results showed that the heat capacity was enhanced by 15% and the viscosity was enhanced by 41–429%. Moreover, the nanofluids have shown significant non-Newtonian behavior (shear thinning). Nanofluids are known to show non-Newtonian behavior when particles have high aspect ratio (e.g., nanotube, rod-like structure) at high concentrations; however, only spherical nanoparticles were dispersed in molten salt at an extremely low concentration (1 wt%). The observed enhancement in heat capacity and the shear thinning behavior could result from the formation of dendritic salt nanostructures. Hence, we added hydroxide at an extremely low concentration (0.03 wt%) to disrupt the formation of such dendritic nanostructures to confirm their effects on the heat capacity and shear thinning behavior. The result showed that the heat capacity enhancement diminished from 15% to 3%. Moreover, the viscosity enhancement decreased from 429% to 148% at low shear rate (10/s) and from 41% to 10% at high shear rate (240/s). Furthermore, the enhanced viscosity of 10% at the highest shear rate (240/s), where the effect of the dendritic nanostructures is minimal, agreed well with a theoretical model developed for the viscosity of a simple liquid doped with nanoparticles. It supports that the dendritic salt nanostructures are primarily responsible for the enhanced heat capacity and the shear-thinning behavior of molten salt nanofluids. Material characterization using an electron microscope confirmed the presence of the dendritic salt nanostructures.

Abstract: The utilization of boron-doped Si solar cells based on the structure of a passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) in the solar industry has increased recently. However, this type of high efficiency solar cell is exposed to a so-called light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID). A suppressing of mc-Si LeTID has been studied through a regeneration treatment at high temperature under illumination or in the dark, but most was about the lifetime samples. In this work, to evaluate the applicability of regeneration and annealing at industrial relevant conditions, industrially made B–Ga co-doped cast-mono Si PERC solar cells were treated in a light soaking tool in which the intensity of light and substrate temperature could be adjusted separately and a rapid thermal process (RTP) system. This treatment was evaluated during a subsequent intentional degradation under conditions of 75 °C with an LED white light source at an intensity of 1 kW/m2. The results showed that properly regenerated samples by high intensity illumination at elevated temperatures suffered from the least degradation, while untreated solar cells had most severe degradation. The RTP method could improve the performance of the solar cells but the RTP-treated samples were less stable than the regenerated samples. It demonstrates the application of a fast (around 20 min) regeneration method could be coupled in mass production. Further, RTP treatment combining with an accelerated regeneration step may be a potential method to provide both the improved performance and high anti-LeTID properties in Si PERC solar cells.

Abstract: In this work, one triple cascade structure is proposed as the electron transporting layer (ETL) for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By combining TiO2, SnO2, and PC61BM simultaneously, the triple cascade ETL is introduced in PSCs to give full play to their respective advantages so that the electron extraction ability could be enhanced and the recombination could be suppressed. In order to investigate the influence of this novel electron transport layer structure on the performance of PSCs, the optical, chemical, and electrical properties of device performance are investigated. The experimental results show that by adopting the triple cascade structure of TiO2/SnO2/PC61BM, devices exhibit an excellent charge extraction ability and recombination suppressing ability. As a result, the devices based on the TiO2/SnO2/PCBM cascade ETL exhibit much higher device performance and better reproducibility than those based on single-layered ETLs or the double-layered ETLs. This study demonstrates that the triple cascade TiO2/SnO2/PCBM film is a promising candidate of ETLs.

Abstract: The gallium gradient of the CIGS film plays a key role for device performance of solar cells. However, a three-stage co-evaporation deposition process at low substrate temperature often produces a pronounced steeper gallium (Ga) gradient, which is detrimental to the transport of carriers and leads to lower conversion efficiency. In this work, we propose a modified low-temperature deposition process by introducing an overlapping process between the 1st stage and the 2nd stage. This modified low-temperature process mitigates the diffusion of In and Ga and facilitates the formation of ideal back gradient. Meanwhile, we have demonstrated the phase transition process of the back gradient during the overlapping process by characterization techniques. With the design of new reaction models during the overlapping process, growth mechanisms of the CIGS film in the modified low-temperature process could be visually displayed. This modified low-temperature process has improved the device efficiency of CIGS solar cells from 14.1% to 16.7%.

Abstract: In this study, a temperature self-regulating solar reactor based on VO2 thermochromic coating is demonstrated. The temperature of solar reactor can be stabilized at 68.8 °C, which is corresponded to the critical point of metal-to-insulator transition of VO2. By employing the solar reactor, the orthorhombic phase CsPbI3 microwires have been synthesized through solution phase reaction route. Strong emission peaks at 490 nm and 470 nm have been observed in CsPbI3 microwires under ultraviolet and soft X-ray excitation, respectively. The high performance photodetector based on CsPbI3 microwire show a detectivity of 1.09 × 1014 Jones, responsivity of 4.72 A/W, rapid rise and decay time of 0.96 and 0.93 s at 325 nm. Our results demonstrate that the temperature self-regulating solar reactor can be applied for energy-saving solution phase reactor for synthesizing high quality inorganic materials.

Abstract: Multiphasic crystallite complex of the most popular photocatalyst – TiO2 has consistently shown better UV and/or visible photoactivity than its pristine monophasic counterparts. An identical behaviour is reported in the studies conducted on ZnO as well. This motivated the present study i) to explore the possibility to establish this as generic behavior for all such materials, and ii) to look for a better material with high photocatalytic activity. The choice of niobium pentoxide for the purpose lies in its uniqueness in terms of its existence in different oxidation states and crystalline phases. Additionally it offers a novel and promising alternative to the existing photoactive nanomaterials due to its apposite band gap, band edge location, stability, sorption characteristics and recyclability. Herein, an attempt has been made to prepare niobium pentoxide with different crystalline phases, including mixed, and analyze their photoactivity in UV and visible ranges. The results show that niobium pentoxide, calcined between 500-800°C, crystallizes predominantly in orthorhombic and 900°C and above in monoclinic phase. The results reveal that under both UV and visible radiation the monophasic (monoclinic phase) niobia has high photoactivity as compared to the other phases in degradation of aqueous probe pollutant. This result is contrary to the expected result. The samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), UV-VIS spectroscopy (UV-VIS DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), photoluminescence(PL) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy(TEM), and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) to arrive at a conclusive explanation of the results. The sorption characteristics of the hydrocolloid system, among others, have been found to be responsible for this behavior.

Abstract: In recent times, solar steam generation has proven to be an efficient method for seawater desalination. Herein, we report a novel solar evaporator designed with plant-derived carbon nanospheres obtained from Cinnamomum camphora incorporated in a polyvinyl alcohol sponge (C@CPVA). The fabricated evaporation device produced steam at a rate of 1.53 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun illumination which was 3.25 times the bare water system. The device further exhibited an outstanding photothermal efficiency of 92.38%, owing to its indirect capillary water pathway design. Furthermore, the C@CPVA array, when integrated in a facile laboratory solar still, generated clean water with an excellent salt removal efficiency of 99.99%. The C@CPVA solar still had exceptional performance even at low, non-concentrated solar intensities, thus enabling its application in practical solar desalination. Finally, the distinct merits of C@CPVA solar still such as excellent low solar intensity performance, facile fabrication and low cost advocate its rapid scaling up to large scale desalination systems. This work should inspire further development of photothermal membrane-incorporated solar stills for non-concentrated, low-intensity solar desalination.

Abstract: According to investigation, the isolated metal particles with special dimension could trigger Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) effect, which would significantly promote the solar modulation ability of VO2 thermochromic films. Nevertheless, there are few research reports about these kinds of structure and derived LSPR effect in VO2 films fabricated by physical vapor deposition. In this work, we employed acid etching approach to modify the surface morphology of sputtered VO2 films, and successfully prepared karst landform-like VO2 films. Besides, LSPR effect was acquired through controllable etching process, which induced excellent optical performance of luminous transmittance (Tlum-L = 61.3%) and solar modulation ability (ΔTsol = 11.9%). Inspired by karst landform, the etching mechanism was speculated, and ideal models based on Maxwell-Garnett theory were proposed for optimal optical performance in nanothermochromics. This kind of facile method may provide a universal idea to modify the surface structure of sputtered films.

Abstract: Sugar alcohols with high latent heat have great potential for medium temperature thermal energy storage. Micro/nano-encapsulation can effectively improve the performance of phase change materials (PCMs), such as avoiding leakage and enhancing thermophysical properties. However, only a few work have been reported on the microencapsulation of sugar alcohol, and the reported methods showed some drawbacks such as requiring strictly controlled reactions or resulting in disability for the capsules to solidify. This paper reports for the first time the synthesis and properties of nanocapsules of a sugar alcohol D-mannitol (DM) by a facile sol-gel method. The nanoencapsulation was confirmed by various characterization using Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Uniform size distribution of the nanoencapsulated DM (NEDM) in 100–200 nm was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The phase change performance of the NEDMs were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The results show that the NEDMs with a melting temperature of 166.2 °C, a melting enthalpy of 220.3 J/g, and an encapsulation ratio of 76.5% were obtained. The thermal reliability of the NEDMs was demonstrated by thermal cycling experiments. The thermal stability of the NEDMs was enhanced compared to DM as investigated by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The NEDMs exhibited great potential for applications in medium temperature thermal energy storage and transfer.

Abstract: In this paper, silicon rich polycrystalline silicon carbide (poly-SiCx) thin films were prepared for passivating contact of silicon solar cells. The effect of different carbon doping ratios R [methane flow (sccm)/silane flow (sccm)] and the annealing temperatures on the passivation quality was investigated. The lifetime test showed that, given a lower annealing temperature, the passivation quality of poly-SiCx thin films was very poor at R over 0.2, and it can be improved by elevating the annealing temperature. The effective lifetime of over 1.8 ms can be obtained with implied open-circuit voltages (iVoc) of 715 mV and saturated dark current (J0) of 18 fA/cm2. The microstructure and optical property of poly-SiCx films was studied by Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The results showed that the incorporation of carbon lowered the crystalline fraction of poly-SiCx and a higher annealing temperature was needed to achieve high crystallinity. The optical band gap of poly-SiCx was widened with increase in R, and got up to 2.3eV when R was 0.4. A proof-of-concept top/rear TOPCon solar cells, featuring a N+-poly-SiCx (R = 0.2) front contact, was fabricated to demonstrate the potential of this SiCx passivation contact. The decrease in the parasitic absorption of light at the front side resulted in higher photogenerated current. And the conversion efficiency of 20.17% was achieved.

Abstract: The first principle molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations in combination with experimental measurements are applied to investigate the thermophysical properties and structural evolution of MgCl2–NaCl–KCl (MNK) eutectic. The densities, melting point, and enthalpy of fusion simulated by FPMD within NPT ensemble are consistent with experimental results. Besides, the thermal conductivity of molten MNK eutectic evaluated from FPMD simulations with NVT ensemble gives satisfactory result. Furthermore, the shear viscosities of MNK eutectic are deduced based on ion self-diffusion coefficients and solvodynamic radius, similar to the data estimated by additive contribution method. Eventually, the change rules of radial and angular distribution functions and structural factor of MNK eutectic during melting are revealed, and the melting mechanism is proposed from the evolution of polyhedral coordination structures. These results are heuristic in structure-activity relationship of MNK eutectic, which sheds insight for further development of efficient heat transfer and storage media through microstructure engineering.

Abstract: The renin-angiotensin system contributes to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, but that the mechanism is unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on osteogenic differentiation of synoviocytes and the underlying mechanism. Ang II was showed to inhibite osteogenic differentiation of synoviocytes, which was mitigated by a Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) inhibitor. DKK-1 was upregulated by Ang II, which was weakened by the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, and p38 inhibitor. Ang II increased the levels of AT1R, ROS, and NADPH oxidase (NOX), and the upregulations were mitigated by the AT1R blocker or NOX inhibitor. Furthermore, Ang II activated the p38 pathway, which was blocked by the AT1R blocker, ROS scavenger, or siRNA-MKK3. In brief, these results indicate that Ang II upregulates NOX expression and ROS production via AT1R, activates the MKK3/p38 signaling, and in turn upregulates DKK-1 expression, participating in the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of synoviocytes.

Abstract: This study examined the effects of the thermal deformation of a silicone-on-glass (SOG) micro aspheric lens on the optical performance of a concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) module. Thermal deformation of the lens induced by temperature variation causes defocalization of the spot of concentrated light on the solar cell, resulting in a change in the optical efficiency and irradiance uniformity in the solar cell area. The irradiance uniformity affects the fill factor of the solar cell. The effects of the thermal deformation of the lens on the optical efficiency and irradiance uniformity in the solar cell area were evaluated through a three-dimensional thermal deformation simulation and ray-tracing simulation. The simulation methods were validated by indoor heating tests using a prototype SOG lens and III–V triple-junction solar cell. The simulation results for optical systems with geometric concentration ratios of 200 × and 500 × revealed that the temperature dependences of the optical performances of a system with SOG micro aspheric lenses showed similar trends to those of a system with SOG Fresnel lenses designed with the same lens surface profiles as aspheric lenses.

Abstract: Backgrounds/Aims
Pancreatic cancer is a digestive system tumour disease with a notably poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of less than 10 %. In recent years, peptide drugs have shown great clinical value in antitumour applications. We aim to identify differentially expressed peptides by using peptidomics techniques to explore the mechanisms involved in the development and pathology of pancreatic cancer.
Methods
We performed peptidomic analysis of pancreatic cancer and paired paracancerous tissues by using ITRAQ labelling technology and conducted in-depth bioinformatics analysis and functional studies on differentially expressed peptides.
Results
A total of 2,881 peptides were identified, of which 133 were differentially expressed (116 were upregulated and 17 were downregulated). By using GO analysis, the differentially expressed peptides were found to be closely related to the tumour microenvironment and extracellular matrix. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that precursor proteins were closely related to the T2DM and RAS signalling pathways. The endogenous peptide P1DG can significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.
Conclusion
P1DG and its precursor GAPDH may be closely related to the proliferation, migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer. Peptidomics can aid in understanding the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer more comprehensively.
