Abstract: Autophagy has a pivotal role in the in-vitro monocyte differentiation into macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), the most powerful antigen presenting cells (APC) with the unique capacity to initiate an adaptive immune response. Autophagy is also a mechanism by which these cells of innate immunity may degrade intracellular pathogens and mediate the antigen processing and presentation, essential to clear an infection. For these reasons, pathogens have learned how to manipulate autophagy for their own survival. In this study we found that hepatitis C virus (HCV), derived from sera of infected patients, blocked the autophagic process in differentiating monocytes, seen as LC3 II and p62 expression levels. The suppression of autophagy correlated with a reduction of cathepsins D, B and proteolytic activity, and resulted in impairment of monocyte differentiation into DCs, as indicated by the reduction of CD1a acquirement. These data suggest that the block of autophagy might be one of the underlying mechanisms of the HCV-mediated immune subversion that frequently leads to viral persistence and chronic hepatitis.

Abstract: We demonstrate a method for the preparation of multijunction polymer solar cells without the use of vacuum evaporation methods or indium tin oxide (ITO). The entire layer stack is prepared by printing or coating of each layer. The number of layers typically employed in complete devices exceeds ten and to efficiently identify layers and interfaces that are not robust we developed a double sided illumination method and demonstrate how layer thicknesses can be optimized with respect to the roll processing in the aim of achieving functional tandem devices. The devices were prepared directly on barrier foil and were later encapsulated. In this study the same active material comprising poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) was employed using nanoparticle based zinc oxide for electron selectivity and several different PEDOT:PSS formulations for hole selectivity, electrode- and recombination layer formation. A novel slanted comb silver grid electrode structure was employed to enable efficient double sided illumination and minimize shunts. The operational stability of the tandem devices evaluated under ISOS-D-2 conditions demonstrated less variation in stability between devices than similar single junctions prepared in the same manner for reference. We demonstrate lifetime studies for 480h without any sign of degradation and estimate that the tandem or multijunction polymer solar cells are as stable as single junctions.

Soluble components of the flagellar export apparatus, FliI, FliJ, and FliH, do not deliver flagellin, the major filament protein, from the cytosol to the export gate,

Abstract: Flagella, the locomotion organelles of bacteria, extend from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior. External flagellar proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and exported by the flagellar type III secretion system. Soluble components of the flagellar export apparatus, FliI, FliH, and FliJ, have been implicated to carry late export substrates in complex with their cognate chaperones from the cytoplasm to the export gate. The importance of the soluble components in the delivery of the three minor late substrates FlgK, FlgL (hook–filament junction) and FliD (filament-cap) has been convincingly demonstrated, but their role in the transport of the major filament component flagellin (FliC) is still unclear. We have used continuous ATPase activity measurements and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies to characterize interactions between the soluble export components and flagellin or the FliC:FliS substrate–chaperone complex. As controls, interactions between soluble export component pairs were characterized providing Kd values. FliC or FliC:FliS did not influence the ATPase activity of FliI alone or in complex with FliH and/or FliJ suggesting lack of interaction in solution. Immobilized FliI, FliH, or FliJ did not interact with FliC or FliC:FliS detected by QCM. The lack of interaction in the fluid phase between FliC or FliC:FliS and the soluble export components, in particular with the ATPase FliI, suggests that cells use different mechanisms for the export of late minor substrates, and the major substrate, FliC. It seems that the abundantly produced flagellin does not require the assistance of the soluble export components to efficiently reach the export gate.

Abstract: Our previous study indicated that specificity protein-1 (Sp1) is accumulated during hypoxia in an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent manner. Herein, we found that the Sp1 was induced strongly at the protein level, but not in the mRNA level, in lung tumor tissue, indicating that translational regulation might contribute to the Sp1 accumulation during tumorigenesis. A further study showed that the translation of Sp1 was dramatically induced through an IRES-dependent pathway. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis of proteins bound to the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of Sp1 identified interacting protein — nucleolin. Knockdown of nucleolin significantly inhibited IRES-mediated translation of Sp1, suggesting that nucleolin positively facilitates Sp1 IRES activation. Further analysis of the interaction between nucleolin and the 5′-UTR of Sp1 mRNA revealed that the GAR domain was important for IRES-mediated translation of Sp1. Moreover, gefitinib, and LY294002 and MK2206 compounds inhibited IRES-mediated Sp1 translation, implying that activation of the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway via Akt activation triggers the IRES pathway. In conclusion, EGFR activation-mediated nucleolin phosphorylated at Thr641 and Thr707 was recruited to the 5′-UTR of Sp1 as an IRES trans-acting factor to modulate Sp1 translation during lung cancer formation.

Abstract: The role of the T-box transcription factor Tbx5 in heart and limb development has been well documented; however, how posttranslational modification is involved in mediating its activity is unknown. Here we report that Tbx5 is a novel target by SUMO conjugation, a posttranslational modification that is involved in a variety of cellular events. Sumoylation potentiated the transcriptional activity of Tbx5, and PIAS family members, a group of SUMO E3 ligase, differentially mediated sumoylation and function of Tbx5. PIAS1 potently stimulated SUMO conjugation to Tbx5, and the physical association of Tbx5 with PIAS1 was required for its full sumoylation. PIAS1 also enhanced the functional cooperation between Tbx5 and its interaction partners. Overlapping expression pattern and colocalization of PIAS1 and Tbx5 in the mouse embryonic hearts and on the native target gene promoter were observed, pointing to a potential functional interaction of these two factors in vivo. These findings provide novel insights into how the transcriptional activity of a cardiac-specific factor, Tbx5, is regulated both directly and indirectly via posttranslational modification by a non-tissue-specific factor, PIAS1.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a method to predict hot spot temperatures in crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules operating under critical shading conditions prior to module fabrication. We developed a unique tool to evaluate the damage risk potential for an individual solar cell. We show that shading conditions leading to the most critical hot spot temperature do not necessarily coincide with the shading conditions for the maximum total power dissipation in the shaded cell. In fact, for an adequate prediction of temperature fields and the worst case shading scenario, spatially resolved information of the power dissipation on cell level and a thermal simulation of the module system are indispensable. Our approach is divided into three steps, starting with an electric network simulation of cell operating points for different shading scenarios. For these operating points we perform spatially resolved lock-in thermography measurements of the power dissipation on cell level. On that basis we compute three-dimensional temperature fields inside the module with a finite-element analysis for different realistic module operating conditions. The model is validated with experimental data on a module of industrial cells.

Abstract: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a major role in the maintenance of photoreceptors, and degeneration of RPE results in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates, increased oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation are all factors damaging the functionality of aged RPE cells. Here, we report that inhibition of proteasomal degradation with MG-132 and autophagy with bafilomycin A1 resulted in the release of IL-1β but not that of IL-18 in human ARPE-19 cells. NLRP3 receptor became upregulated, and caspase-1, the functional component of an inflammasome complex, was activated. In addition to accumulating intracellular protein aggregates, inhibition of degradation systems induced oxidative stress which was demonstrated by elevated amounts of intracellular 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-protein adducts. Along with IL-1β, exposure to MG-132 and bafilomycin A1 resulted in the secretion of IL-8. A low concentration (1pg/ml) of IL-1β was capable of triggering significant IL-8 production which also became attenuated by treatment with a specific caspase-1 inhibitor. These results suggest that decline in intracellular degradation systems results not only in increased amounts of intracellular protein aggregates and oxidative stress but also in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, arisen as a result of elevated production of biologically active IL-1β.

Abstract: Complex organisms may coordinate molecular responses to hypoxia by specialized avenues of communication across multiple tissues, but these mechanisms are poorly understood. Plasma-based, extracellular microRNAs have been described, yet their regulation and biological functions in hypoxia remain enigmatic. We found a unique pattern of release of the hypoxia-inducible microRNA-210 (miR-210) from hypoxic and reoxygenated cells. This microRNA is also elevated in human plasma in physiologic and pathologic conditions of altered oxygen demand and delivery. Released miR-210 can be delivered to recipient cells, and the suppression of its direct target ISCU and mitochondrial metabolism is primarily evident in hypoxia. To regulate these hypoxia-specific actions, prolyl-hydroxylation of Argonaute 2 acts as a molecular switch that reciprocally modulates miR-210 release and intracellular activity in source cells as well as regulates intracellular activity in recipient cells after miR-210 delivery. Therefore, Argonaute 2-dependent control of released miR-210 represents a unique communication system that integrates the hypoxic response across anatomically distinct cells, preventing unnecessary activity of delivered miR-210 in normoxia while still preparing recipient tissues for incipient hypoxic stress and accelerating adaptation.

Abstract: CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) induces plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) expression in macrophages, leading to enhanced migration through vitronectin. However, the precise role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in PAI-1 induced migration of macrophages in the inflammatory environment is not known. In this study, we elucidated a novel mechanism describing the altered role of LRP1 in macrophage migration depending on the activation state of the cells. Experimental evidence clearly shows that the blocking of LRP1 function inhibited the PAI-induced migration of resting RAW 264.7 cells through vitronectin but exerted a pro-migratory effect on CpG-ODN-activated cells. We also demonstrate that CpG-ODN downregulates the protein and mRNA levels of LRP1 both in vivo and in vitro, a function that depends on the NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in reduced internalization of PAI-1. This work illustrates the distinct mechanism that PAI-1-induced migration of CpG-ODN-activated cells through vitronectin depends on the interaction of PAI-1 with vitronectin but not LRP1 unlike in the resting cells, where the migration is LRP1 dependent and vitronectin independent. In conclusion, our experimental results demonstrate the altered function of LRP1 in the migration of resting and activated macrophages in the context of microenvironmental extracellular matrix components.

Abstract: With the help of the Langmuir space charge theory, the performance of a photon-enhanced thermionic solar cell (PETSC) limited by space charge is discussed. It is found that space charge effects become important for the PETSC when the gap width between two electrodes is a few microns or more. At these distances, near-field heat transfer effects are negligible because the gaps are larger than the characteristic wavelength of the thermal radiation, as given by Wien's displacement law. The effects of the energy band gap, electron affinity and temperature of the cathode on the efficiency of the PETSC are analyzed in detail. The maximum efficiency of the PETSC limited by the space charge is calculated under different constraint conditions. Although the maximum efficiency obtained here is much smaller than that calculated theoretically by Schwede et al., Nature Materials 9 (2010) 762, it may be higher than those of traditional solar cells and thermionic devices as long as the gap width of two electrodes is rationally designed.

Abstract: The members of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family of Ser/Thr kinases are downstream effectors of MAPK/ERK pathway that regulate diverse cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation and survival. In carcinogenesis, RSKs are thought to modulate cell motility, invasion and metastasis. Herein, we have studied an involvement of RSKs in FGF2/FGFR2-driven behaviours of mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells. We found that both silencing and inhibiting of FGFR2 attenuated phosphorylation of RSKs, whereas FGFR2 overexpression and/or its stimulation with FGF2 enhanced RSKs activity. Moreover, treatment with ERK, Src and p38 inhibitors revealed that p38 kinase acts as an upstream RSK2 regulator. We demonstrate for the first time that in FGF2/FGFR2 signalling, p38 but not MEK/ERK, indirectly activated RSK2 at Tyr529, which facilitated phosphorylation of its other residues (Thr359/Ser363, Thr573 and Ser380). In contrast to FGF2-triggered signalling, inhibition of p38 in the EGF pathway affected only RSK2-Tyr529, without any impact on the remaining RSK phosphorylation sites. p38-mediated phosphorylation of RSK2-Tyr529 was crucial for the transactivation of residues located at kinase C-terminal domain and linker-region, specifically, in the FGF2/FGFR2 signalling pathway. Furthermore, we show that FGF2 promoted anchorage-independent cell proliferation, formation of focal adhesions and cell migration, which was effectively abolished by treatment with RSKs inhibitor (FMK). These indicate that RSK2 activity is indispensable for FGF2/FGFR2-mediated cellular effects. Our findings identified a new FGF2/FGFR2-p38-RSK2 pathway, which may play a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer and, hence, may present a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of FGFR2-expressing tumours.

Abstract: To determine the energy transfer through a plastic net-covered structure, the temperature of the net (Tn) is an essential parameter. The perforated nature of nets and the effects of solar and thermal radiation, during the daytimes, make it is impossible to measure Tn correctly by using most types of thermometer. Therefore, Tn has never been theoretically estimated or experimentally measured in the presence of solar and thermal radiation. In this study, Tn was simulated by determining the emissive power of the net (En) and the net emittance (εn). To determine En and εn, the net was tacked onto a wooden frame; thermal radiation balance was applied below and above the net surfaces and above the substrate underneath the frame. The downward and upward thermal radiation fluxes were measured below and above the net to be used in the simulation. A simple measuring method was proposed to predict Tn using a thermocouple junction of 0.3mm in diameter (copper constantan, type-T) inserted into the net texture. The measured values of Tn were in agreement with those predicted by the simulation. The mean absolute difference between the measured and the simulated values of Tn ranged from 0.75°C to 1.9°C for all the nets tested. For nets with low porosity, the inserted junction should keep exposing to the surrounding environment. However, for nets with high porosity, the inserted junction should be shielded from radiation to improve measurements in the correct direction.

Abstract: Dysequilibrium syndrome (DES, OMIM 224050) is a genetically heterogeneous condition that combines autosomal recessive non-progressive cerebellar ataxia with mental retardation. The subclass dysequilibrium syndrome type 1 (CAMRQ1) has been attributed to mutations in the VLDLR gene encoding the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR). This receptor is involved in the Reelin signaling pathway that guides neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Three missense mutations (c.1459G>T; p.D487Y, c.1561G>C; p.D521H and c.2117G>T; p.C706F) have been previously identified in VLDLR gene in patients with DES. However, the functional implications of those mutations are not known and therefore we undertook detailed functional analysis to elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying their pathogenicity. The mutations have been generated by site-directed mutagenesis and then expressed in cultured cell lines. Confocal microscopy and biochemical analysis have been employed to examine the subcellular localization and functional activities of the mutated proteins relative to wild type. Our results indicate that the three missense mutations lead to defective intracellular trafficking and ER retention of the mutant VLDLR protein. This trafficking impairment prevents the mutants from reaching the plasma membrane and binding exogenous Reelin, the initiating event in Reelin signaling. Collectively, our results provide evidence that ER quality control is involved in the functional inactivation and underlying pathogenicity of these DES-associated mutations in the VLDLR.

Abstract: DNA damage, which perturbs genomic stability, has been linked to cognitive decline in the aging human brain, and mutations in DNA repair genes have neurological implications. Several studies have suggested that DNA damage is also increased in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the precise mechanisms connecting DNA damage with neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. CDK5, a critical enzyme in the development of the central nervous system, phosphorylates a number of synaptic proteins and regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity and learning. In addition to these physiological roles, CDK5 has been involved in the neuronal death initiated by DNA damage. We hypothesized that p19INK4d, a member of the cell cycle inhibitor family INK4, is involved in a neuroprotective mechanism activated in response to DNA damage. We found that in response to genotoxic injury or increased levels of intracellular calcium, p19INK4d is transcriptionally induced and phosphorylated by CDK5 which provides it with greater stability in postmitotic neurons. p19INK4d expression improves DNA repair, decreases apoptosis and increases neuronal survival under conditions of genotoxic stress. Our in vivo experiments showed that decreased levels of p19INK4d rendered hippocampal neurons more sensitive to genotoxic insult resulting in the loss of cognitive abilities that rely on the integrity of this brain structure. We propose a feedback mechanism by which the neurotoxic effects of CDK5-p25 activated by genotoxic stress or abnormal intracellular calcium levels are counteracted by the induction and stabilization of p19INK4d protein reducing the adverse consequences on brain functions.

Abstract: Cell adhesion and migration play important roles in physiological and pathological states, including embryonic development and cancer invasion and metastasis. The type I transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor and two follistatin motifs 2 (TMEFF2) is expressed mainly in brain and prostate and its expression is deregulated in prostate cancer. We have previously shown that TMEFF2 can function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell migration and invasion of prostate cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this inhibition are not clear. In this study we demonstrate that TMEFF2 affects cell adhesion and migration of prostate cancer cells and that this effect correlates with changes in integrin expression and RhoA activation. Deletion of a 13 basic-rich amino acid region in the cytoplasmic domain of TMEFF2 prevented these effects. Overexpression of TMEFF2 reduced cell attachment and migration on vitronectin and caused a concomitant decrease in RhoA activation, stress fiber formation and expression of αv, β1 and β3 integrin subunits. Conversely, TMEFF2 interference in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells resulted in an increased integrin expression. Results obtained with a double TRAMP/TMEFF2 transgenic mouse also indicated that TMEFF2 expression reduced integrin expression in the mouse prostate. In summary, the data presented here indicate an important role of TMEFF2 in regulating cell adhesion and migration that involves integrin signaling and is mediated by its cytoplasmic domain.

Abstract: Among the large number of variants belonging to the pancreatic-type secretory ribonuclease (RNase) superfamily, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A) is the proto-type and bovine seminal RNase (BS-RNase) represents the unique natively dimeric member. In the present manuscript, we evaluate the anti-tumoral property of these RNases in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines and in nontumorigenic cells as normal control. We demonstrate that BS-RNase stimulates a strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect in cancer cells, while RNase A is largely ineffective. Notably, we reveal for the first time that BS-RNase triggers Beclin1-mediated autophagic cancer cell death, providing evidences that high proliferation rate of cancer cells may render them more susceptible to autophagy by BS-RNase treatment. Notably, to improve the autophagic response of cancer cells to BS-RNase we used two different strategies: the more basic (as compared to WT enzyme) G38K mutant of BS-RNase, known to interact more strongly than wt with the acidic membrane of cancer cells, or BS-RNase oligomerization (tetramerization or formation of larger oligomers). Both mutant BS-RNase and BS-RNase oligomers potentiated autophagic cell death as compared to WT native dimer of BS-RNase, while the various RNase A oligomers remained completely ineffective. Altogether, our results shed more light on the mechanisms lying at the basis of BS-RNase antiproliferative effect in cancer cells, and support its potential use to develop new anti-cancer strategies.

Abstract: In back-contact solar cells, both external polarities are located at the back surface of the device, which allows for higher photocurrent generation on cell level and reduced series resistance on module level, leading to higher energy conversion efficiencies compared to conventional solar cells and modules. However, the majority charge carriers, which are generated near the back emitter, have to flow laterally e.g. through the base in order to reach the external majority carrier contact. In the present work, we analyse the lateral series resistance by means of measurement and simulation for high-performance metal wrap through (HIP-MWT) solar cells. We compare theoretical models and experimental methods to extract the effective series resistance from simulated and measured current–voltage characteristics and show that lateral voltage variations significantly increase the local recombination current. If the width of the gap between the external majority carrier contacts is reduced from the typical value of 3.5mm to ideally 0mm, we expect an increase of the energy conversion efficiency of approximately 0.1%abs. for cells with three continuous rear emitter contacts on 125mm×125mm large silicon wafers. In a simulation study, the bulk doping concentration NA and the bulk lifetime are varied yielding an optimal base resistivity of 0.6Ωcm–1.5Ωcm for HIP-MWT solar cells based on Czochralski-grown silicon in the degraded state of the boron–oxygen defect and an optimal resistivity of less than 1.0Ωcm for the case of bulk lifetimes larger than ~300µs.

Abstract: Thermographic methods are widely established to detect shunts in photovoltaic technologies. In all methods the cell has to be directly accessible to determine quantitative shunt values. In this manuscript a precise method is presented to determine shunt values in solar modules consisting of series connected bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells without the need to access the single cells separately. It will be shown that, although parallel resistances in organic solar cells show a strong dependence on the illumination intensity, the shunts that are detected using illuminated lock-in-thermography are strongly ohmic and therefore can be assigned a distinct ohm value.

Abstract: Electrospray (ES) as a thin film deposition method that is uniquely suited for manufacturing organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) with desired characteristics of atmospheric pressure fabrication, roll-to-roll compatibility, less material loss, and possible self-organized nanostructures. The additional solvent with high electrical conductivity plays an important role in ES deposition process to fabricate OPVs with active layer composed of polymer mixture poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM). Here we introduced acetic acid, which possesses high electrical conductivity, as additive solvent in ES process. The dependence of device performance on the concentration of acetic acid was investigated, and optimal ratio was obtained. To further demonstrate the influence of additive solvents with different electrical conductivity, OPV devices with active layer deposited by ES method using solutions containing acetic acid, acetone or acetonitrile were fabricated. The characteristics of active layers were revealed by optical microscope, atomic force microscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Compared with additive solvents of acetone and acetonitrile, the active layer formed by electrospraying solvent containing acetic acid demonstrated enhanced vertical segregation distribution and improved P3HT crystallinity, which resulted in better device performance. OPV device using acetic acid as additive achieved power convention efficiency (PCE) of 2.99±0.08% under AM 1.5 solar simulation, which is on par with that of the spin coated device (PCE 3.12±0.07%).

Involvement of store-operated Ca2+ entry in activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and stimulation of glucose uptake by M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human neuroblastoma cells,

Abstract: Gq/11-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) belonging to M1, M3 and M5 subtypes have been shown to activate the metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β (CaMKKβ)-mediated phosphorylation at Thr172. However, the source of Ca2+ required for this response has not been yet elucidated. Here, we investigated the involvement of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in AMPK activation by pharmacologically defined M3 mAChRs in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. In Ca2+-free medium the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) caused a transient increase of phospho-Thr172 AMPK that rapidly ceased within 2min. Conversely, in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ CCh-induced AMPK phosphorylation lasted for at least 180min. The SOCE modulator 2-aminoethoxydiphephenyl borate (2-APB), at a concentration (50μM) that suppressed CCh-induced intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) plateau, inhibited CCh-induced AMPK phosphorylation. CCh triggered the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1, as indicated by redistribution of STIM1 immunofluorescence into puncta, and promoted the association of STIM1 with the SOCE channel component Orai1. Cell depletion of STIM1 by siRNA treatment reduced both CCh-induced [Ca2+]i plateau and AMPK activation. M3 mAChRs increased glucose uptake and this response required extracellular Ca2+ and was inhibited by 2-APB, STIM1 knockdown, CaMKKβ and AMPK inhibitors, and adenovirus infection with dominant negative AMPK. Thus, the study provides evidence that SOCE is required for sustained activation of AMPK and stimulation of downstream glucose uptake by M3 mAChRs and suggests that SOCE is a critical process connecting M3 mAChRs to the control of neuronal energy metabolism.

Abstract: ITO/ZnO/CdS/CdTe/Mo solar cells have been grown in the substrate configuration by a combination of close-space sublimation and RF sputtering. A peak efficiency of 8.01% was achieved. A two stage CdCl2 annealing process was developed, with the first stage contributing to CdTe doping and the second being linked to CdTe/CdS interdiffusion by secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis. The inclusion of a ZnO layer between CdS and ITO layers improved performance significantly (from η=6% to η=8%) by increasing the shunt resistance, RSH, from 563Ωcm2 to 881Ωcm2. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy highlighted the importance of the resistive ZnO layer as numerous pinholes and voids exist in the CdS film. Solar cell performance was also investigated as a function of CdTe thickness, with optimal thicknesses being in the range 3–6μm. All devices were deemed to be limited principally by a non-Ohmic back contact, the Schottky barrier height being determined to be 0.51eV by temperature dependent J–V measurements. Modelling of device performance using SCAPS predicted efficiencies as high as 11.3% may be obtainable upon formation of an Ohmic back-contact. SCAPS modelling also demonstrated that a quasi-Ohmic back-contact may be achievable via inclusion of a highly p-doped (~1018cm−3) buffer layer, between CdTe and Mo, which also has an optimal electron affinity (4.2eV). The evaluation of device processing and the in-depth characterisation presented here provides a number of insights towards the continued improvement of substrate cell performance.

Abstract: The behavior of solar cells under reverse bias conditions is of crucial importance for solar module design and stability. For flexible, low temperature deposited Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) solar cells indications for tunnel breakdown at operation temperatures around 300K are found using temperature and net carrier concentration dependent measurements of the breakdown voltage VBR. For temperatures below 200K, the temperature coefficient of the breakdown voltage becomes positive, indicating a change of the breakdown mechanism to avalanche breakdown. A reduction of VBR caused by the illumination with blue photons is demonstrated, which coincides well with results and models for high temperature deposited CIGSe on glass. Furthermore, spectrally resolved measurements of light emission during breakdown indicate a first ReBEL (reverse bias electroluminescence) signature for CIGSe solar cells.

Abstract: We have previously established a yeast model of mitochondrial (mt) diseases. We showed that defective respiratory phenotypes due to point-mutations in mt tRNALeu(UUR), tRNAIle and tRNAVal could be relieved by overexpression of both cognate and non-cognate nuclearly encoded mt aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) LeuRS, IleRS and ValRS. More recently, we showed that the isolated carboxy-terminal domain (Cterm) of yeast mt LeuRS, and even short peptides derived from the human Cterm, have the same suppressing abilities as the whole enzymes. In this work, we extend these results by investigating the activity of a number of mt aaRS from either class I or II towards a panel of mt tRNAs. The Cterm of both human and yeast mt LeuRS has the same spectrum of activity as mt aaRS belonging to class I and subclass a, which is the most extensive among the whole enzymes. Yeast Cterm is demonstrated to be endowed with mt targeting activity. Importantly, peptide fragments β30_31 and β32_33, derived from the human Cterm, have even higher efficiency as well as wider spectrum of activity, thus opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Bind-shifting experiments show that the β30_31 peptide directly interacts with human mt tRNALeu(UUR) and tRNAIle, suggesting that the rescuing activity of isolated peptide fragments is mediated by a chaperone-like mechanism. Wide-range suppression appears to be idiosyncratic of LeuRS and its fragments, since it is not shared by Cterminal regions derived from human mt IleRS or ValRS, which are expected to have very different structures and interactions with tRNAs.

Abstract: Under general working conditions, organic solar cells are exposed to a multitude of degradative stresses, including light, oxygen, temperature and humidity. We selectively exposed the layer stacks of three different material systems, P3HT, PCDTBT and AnE-PVcc in bulk heterojunction with fullerene, to different combinations of stresses, starting from one single stress and then iteratively adding a new stress to the combination. This allowed us to determine how harshly different polymers get affected by individual stress factors. P3HT based devices show an overall higher stability compared to PCDTBT or AnE-PVcc. All of the devices are affected the most by combined influences of light, oxygen, humidity and temperature, and they cease functioning within a couple of hours of exposure. A thermodynamically driven formation of a thin PCBM layer at the anode is observed with the prolonged storage, which causes an increase in the current densities for the large reverse voltages. We explain this phenomenon by tunneling from the fullerene HOMO to the LUMO, as a result of a large gradient in the electric potential over this layer. The increase of open circuit voltage of the pre-annealed P3HT devices upon UV photolysis was investigated, and attributed to the UV irradiation facilitated destruction of the face-on P3HT layer grown on the surface of the active layer. The effect of the sequence in which the annealing step is performed with respect to evaporation and degradation on the performance upon degradation is discussed.

Abstract: Upregulation of Pin1 was shown to advance the functioning of several oncogenic pathways. It was recently shown that Pin1 is potentially an excellent prognostic marker and can also serve as a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of Pin1 overexpression in prostate cancer is still unclear. In the present study, we showed that the mRNA expression levels of Pin1 were not correlated with Pin1 protein levels in prostate cell lines which indicated that Pin1 may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. A key player in post-transcriptional regulation is represented by microRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively regulate expressions of protein-coding genes at the post-transcriptional level. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-296-5p has a conserved binding site in the Pin1 3′-untranslated region (UTR). A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the seed region of miR-296-5p directly interacts with the 3′-UTR of Pin1 mRNA. Moreover, miR-296-5p expression was found to be inversely correlated with Pin1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, restoration of miR-296-5p or the knockdown of Pin1 had the same effect on the inhibition of the ability of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cell lines. Our results support miR-296-5p playing a tumor-suppressive role by targeting Pin1 and implicate potential effects of miR-296-5p on the prognosis and clinical application to prostate cancer therapy.

Abstract: We synthesized organic photovoltaic materials that have high molecular weight and good solubility. A new random copolymer named poly[carbazole-co-dithienylbenzothiadiazole-co-dithienylquinoxaline] (PC-TBT-TQ) was polymerized through the Suzuki coupling reaction. PC-TBT-TQ was dissolved in a common organic solvent, and its Mn indicates a high molecular weight of 216.2kg/mol. According to the result of thermal analysis, very high thermal stability was observed, with an approximately 5wt% weight loss at 440°C. The optical band gap of PC-TBT-TQ (1.89eV) is slightly higher than that of PCDTBT (1.87eV). The HOMO and LUMO levels of PC-TBT-TQ (HOMO level: 5.45eV, LUMO level: 3.56eV) are similar to those of PCDTBT (HOMO level: 5.45eV, LUMO level: 3.58eV). The OPV properties of the polymer were assessed by fabricating bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells in the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active-layer/BaF2/Ba/Al structure. When PC-TBT-TQ and PC71BM were fabricated in a 1:4 ratio, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were 0.83V, 9.5mA/cm2, 43.3% and 3.5%, respectively.

Abstract: The oncofetal H19 gene transcribes a long non-coding RNA(lncRNA) that is essential for tumor growth. Here we found that numerous established inducers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition(EMT) also induced H19/miR-675 expression. Both TGF-β and hypoxia concomitantly induced H19 and miR-675 with the induction of EMT markers. We identified the PI3K/AKT pathway mediating the inductions of Slug, H19 RNA and miR-675 in response to TGF-β treatment, while Slug induction depended on H19 RNA. In the EMT induced multidrug resistance model, H19 level was also induced. In a mouse breast cancer model, H19 expression was tightly correlated with metastatic potential. In patients, we detected high H19 expression in all common metastatic sites tested, regardless of tumor primary origin. H19 RNA suppressed the expression of E-cadherin protein. H19 up-regulated Slug expression concomitant with the suppression of E-cadherin protein through a mechanism that involved miR-675. Slug also up-regulated H19 expression and activated its promoter. Altogether, these results may support the existence of a positive feedback loop between Slug and H19/miR-675, that regulates E-cadherin expression. H19 RNA enhanced the invasive potential of cancer cells in vitro and enhanced tumor metastasis in vivo. Additionally, H19 knockdown attenuated the scattering and tumorigenic effects of HGF/SF. Our results present novel mechanistic insights into a critical role for H19 RNA in tumor progression and indicate a previously unknown link between H19/miR-675, Slug and E-cadherin in the regulation of cancer cell EMT programs.

Abstract: Intramuscular creatine plays a crucial role in maintaining skeletal muscle energy homeostasis, and its entry into the cell is dependent upon the sodium chloride dependent Creatine Transporter (CrT; Slc6a8). CrT activity is regulated by a number of factors including extra- and intracellular creatine concentrations, hormones, changes in sodium concentration, and kinase activity, however very little is known about the regulation of CrT gene expression. The present study aimed to investigate how Creatine Transporter (CrT) gene expression is regulated in skeletal muscle. Within the first intron of the CrT gene, we identified a conserved sequence that includes the motif recognized by the Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), also known as an Estrogen-related receptor response element (ERRE). Additional ERREs confirming to the known consensus sequence were also identified in the region upstream of the promoter. When partnered with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha (PGC-1α) or beta (PGC-1β), ERRα induces the expression of many genes important for cellular bioenergetics. We therefore hypothesized that PGC-1 and ERRα could also regulate CrT gene expression and creatine uptake in skeletal muscle. Here we show that adenoviral overexpression of PGC-1α or PGC-1β in L6 myotubes increased CrT mRNA (2.1 and 1.7-fold, P<0.0125) and creatine uptake (1.8 and 1.6-fold, P<0.0125), and this effect was inhibited with co-expression of shRNA for ERRα. Overexpression of a constitutively active ERRα (VP16-ERRα) increased CrT mRNA approximately 8-fold (P<0.05), resulting in a 2.2-fold (P<0.05) increase in creatine uptake. Lastly, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PGC-1α and ERRα directly interact with the CrT gene and increase CrT gene expression.

Abstract: In breast cancer the presence of cells undergoing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is indicative of metastasis progression. Since metabolic features of breast tumour cells are critical in cancer progression and drug resistance, we hypothesized that the lipid content of malignant cells might be a useful indirect measure of cancer progression. In this study Multivariate Curve Resolution was applied to cellular Raman spectra to assess the metabolic composition of breast cancer cells undergoing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Multivariate Curve Resolution analysis led to the conclusion that this transition affects the lipid profile of cells, increasing tryptophan but maintaining a low fatty acid content in comparison with highly metastatic cells. Supporting those results, a Partial Least Square-Discriminant analysis was performed to test the ability of Raman spectroscopy to discriminate the initial steps of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells. We achieved a high level of sensitivity and specificity, 94% and 100%, respectively. In conclusion, Raman microspectroscopy coupled with Multivariate Curve Resolution enables deconvolution and tracking of the molecular content of cancer cells during a biochemical process, being a powerful, rapid, reagent-free and non-invasive tool for identifying metabolic features of breast cancer cell aggressiveness at first stages of malignancy.

Abstract: The human c10orf10 gene product, also known as decidual protein induced by progesterone (DEPP), is known to be differentially regulated in mouse tissues in response to hypoxia and oxidative stress, however its biological function remains unknown. We found that mice lacking extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) show attenuated expression of DEPP in response to acute hypoxia. DEPP mRNA levels, as well as the activity of a reporter gene expressed under the control of the DEPP 5′-flanking region, were significantly upregulated in Hep3B and Vero cells overexpressing EC-SOD. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that overexpressed DEPP is co-localized with both protein aggregates and aggresomes. Further biochemical characterization indicates that DEPP protein is unstable and undergoes rapid degradation. Inhibition of proteasome activities significantly increases DEPP protein levels in soluble and insoluble cytosolic fractions. Attenuation of autophagosomal activity by 3-methyladenine increases DEPP protein levels while activation of autophagy by rapamycin reduced DEPP protein levels. In addition, ectopic overexpression of DEPP leads to autophagy activation, while silencing of DEPP attenuates autophagy. Collectively, these results indicate that DEPP is a major hypoxia-inducible gene involved in the activation of autophagy and whose expression is regulated by oxidative stress.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle formation is a multistep process involving proliferation, differentiation, alignment and fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes which fuse with additional myoblast to form myofibers. Toca-1 (Transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly), is an adaptor protein which activates N-WASP in conjunction with Cdc42 to facilitate membrane invagination, endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Expression of Toca-1 in mouse primary myoblasts and C2C12 myoblasts was up-regulated on day 1 of differentiation and subsequently down-regulated during differentiation. Knocking down Toca-1 expression in C2C12 cells (Toca-1KD cells) resulted in a significant decrease in myotube formation and expression of shRNA-resistant Toca-1 in Toca-1KD cells rescued the myogenic defect, suggesting that the knockdown was specific and Toca-1 is essential for myotube formation. Toca-1KD cells exhibited elongated spindle-like morphology, expressed myogenic markers (MyoD and MyHC) and localized N-Cadherin at cell periphery similar to control cells suggesting that Toca-1 is not essential for morphological changes or expression of proteins critical for differentiation. Toca-1KD cells displayed prominent actin fibers suggesting a defect in actin cytoskeleton turnover necessary for cell–cell fusion. Toca-1KD cells migrated faster than control cells and had a reduced number of vinculin patches similar to N-WASPKO MEF cells. Transfection of N-WASP-expressing plasmid into Toca-1KD cells restored myotube formation of Toca-1KD cells. Thus, our results suggest that Toca-1KD cells have defects in formation of myotubes probably due to reduced activity of actin cytoskeleton regulators such as N-WASP. This is the first study to identify and characterize the role of Toca-1 in myogenesis.

Abstract: Endothelial cells in the vascular system are constantly subjected to the frictional force of shear stress due to the pulsatile nature of blood flow. Although several proteins form part of the shear stress mechano-sensing pathway, the identification of mechano-transducing pathways is largely unknown. Given the increasing evidence for a signaling function of mitochondria in endothelial cells, the aim of this study was to investigate their role as mechano-sensor organelles during laminar shear stress (LSS). We demonstrated that LSS activates intracellular signaling pathways that modulate not only mitochondrial dynamics but also mitochondrial function. At early time points of LSS, the fission-related protein Drp1 was recruited from the cytosol to mitochondria and activated mitochondrial fission. LSS-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was indispensable for mitochondrial fission. As alterations in mitochondrial dynamics have been related to changes in bioenergetics profiles, we studied mitochondrial function after LSS. We found that LSS decreased respiration rate, increased mitochondrial membrane potential and promoted the mitochondrial generation of ROS with the subsequent oxidation and activation of the antioxidant enzyme PRX3. Our data support a novel and active role for mitochondria in endothelial cells as active players, able to transduce the mechanical force of shear stress in the vascular endothelium into a biological response.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an apparatus capable of measuring electrical resistance and light transmission through a flexible transparent conductor (TC) as it is actively deformed. The measurements are performed in situ with time resolution on the order of ~100ms, and the resistance/transmission data is further used to calculate TC figures-of-merit in real-time. With this instrument, we are able to track and compare the evolution of figures-of-merit for different TCs as they are actively deformed. To demonstrate the tool, we evaluate several common TCs including indium tin oxide, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and silver nanowires, as well as a more unconventional nanowire/PEDOT:PSS hybrid. As expected, indium tin oxide degrades rapidly with strain, while the more flexible PEDOT:PSS is far more strain tolerant. The nanowire/PEDOT:PSS composite is found to produce an advantageous effect, as the silver nanowires generate large figures-of-merit at low strain, and the addition of a PEDOT:PSS component vastly improves strain tolerance.

Abstract: Transient photocapacitance (TPC) and photocurrent (TPI) spectroscopy were used to characterize defects in CdTe/CdS solar cells. A broad defect band is observed at an optical energy of 1.28eV above the valence band, and such a defect is not indicated by admittance spectroscopy and drive-level capacitance profiling. Temperature-dependent TPC measurements of the defect band follow a thermal quenching model in which the defect׳s energy, 0.22eV below the conduction band, is consistent with the optical response. We provide a theoretical basis for the use of a thermal quenching model in TPC.

Abstract: The G protein-coupled receptor GPR30/GPER has been shown to mediate rapid effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) in diverse types of cancer cells. Here, we provide evidence for a novel crosstalk between GPER and the Notch signaling pathway in breast cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We show that E2 and the GPER selective ligand G-1 induce both the γ-secretase-dependent activation of Notch-1 and the expression of the Notch target gene Hes-1. These inductions are prevented by knocking down GPER or by using a dominant-negative mutant of the Notch transcriptional co-activator Master-mind like-1 (DN-MAML-1), hence suggesting the involvement of GPER in the Notch-dependent transcription. By performing chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments and luciferase assays, we also demonstrate that E2 and G-1 induce the recruitment of the intracellular domain of Notch-1 (N1ICD) to the Hes-1 promoter and the transactivation of a Hes-1-reporter gene, respectively. Functionally, the E2 and G-1-induced migration of breast cancer cells and CAFs is abolished in presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor GSI or DN-MAML-1, which both inhibit the Notch signaling pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that E2 and G-1 prevent the expression of VE-Cadherin, while both compounds induce the expression of Snail, a Notch target gene acting as a repressor of cadherins expression. Notably, both GSI and DN-MAML-1 abolish the up-regulation of Snail-1 by E2 and G-1, whereas the use of GSI rescues VE-Cadherin expression. Taken together, our results prove the involvement of the Notch signaling pathway in mediating the effects of estrogenic GPER signaling in breast cancer cells and CAFs.

Abstract: The backsheets used in photovoltaic modules are exposed to aggressive field environments that may include combined temperature cycles, moisture, and mechanical loads. The effects of the field environment on backsheet debonding, which can lead to module degradation (corrosion) and loss of function, are still not well understood or quantified. Employing a newly developed quantitative mechanics technique, we report the effect of aging on backsheet debond energy, including the separate effect of temperature, mechanical stress and relative humidity on debond growth rate. The debond energy of the backsheet decreased dramatically from 1000 to 27J/m2 within the first 750h of exposure to hot (85°C) and humid (85% RH) aging treatments. The debond growth rate increased up to 500-fold with small changes of temperature (10°C) and relative humidity (20%). To elucidate the mechanisms of environmental debonding, we developed a fracture-kinetics model, where the molecular relaxation processes at the debond front are used to predict debond growth. The model and techniques form the fundamental basis to develop accelerated aging tests and long-term reliability predictions for photovoltaic backsheets.

Abstract: The advanced stages of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) are characterized not only by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in high susceptibility to infections, but also by high constitutive activity of NFκB, which promotes cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. The increased expression of the proto-oncogene Bcl3 belonging to IκB family is associated with the pathogenesis of the different types of human cancer, yet, the function and regulation of Bcl3 in CTCL have not been studied. Here, we show that Bcl3 is highly expressed in CTCL Hut-78 and HH cells. The suppression of Bcl3 levels decreases the expression of the pro-survival genes cIAP1 and cIAP2, reduces cell viability, and increases CTCL apoptosis. Interestingly, Bcl3 suppression concomitantly increases expression and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-17 in CTCL cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that Bcl3 regulates cIAP1, cIAP2, IL-8 and IL-17 gene expression through direct binding to their promoters. Bcl3 expression is regulated by bortezomib (BZ)-mediated proteasome inhibition, and BZ inhibits Bcl3 recruitment to its target promoters, resulting in decreased expression of cIAP1 and cIAP2, but increased expression of IL-8 and IL-17. The Bcl3 expression is regulated through NFκB subunit exchange on Bcl3 promoter. In untreated cells, the Bcl3 promoter is occupied predominantly by p65/p50 heterodimers, inducing Bcl3 expression; however, in BZ-treated cells, the p65/50 heterodimers are replaced by p52 subunits, resulting in Bcl3 transcriptional repression. These data provide the first insights into the function and regulation of Bcl3 in CTCL, and indicate that Bcl3 has an important pro-survival and immunosuppressive role in these cells.

Abstract: Numerous studies have shown that the NALP3 inflammasome plays an important role in various immune and inflammatory diseases. However, whether the NALP3 inflammasome is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is unclear. In our study, we confirmed that high glucose (HG) concentrations induced NALP3 inflammasome activation both in vivo and in vitro. Blocking NALP3 inflammasome activation by NALP3/ASC shRNA and caspase-1 inhibition prevented IL-1β production and eventually attenuated podocyte and glomerular injury under HG conditions. We also found that thioredoxin (TRX)-interacting protein (TXNIP), which is a pro-oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory factor, activated NALP3 inflammasome by interacting with NALP3 in HG-exposed podocytes. Knocking down TXNIP impeded NALP3 inflammasome activation and alleviated podocyte injury caused by HG. In summary, the NALP3 inflammasome mediates podocyte and glomerular injury in DN, moreover, TXNIP participates in the formation and activation of the NALP3 inflammasome in podocytes during DN, which represents a novel mechanism of podocyte and glomerular injury under diabetic conditions.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes by inhibiting translation or inducing degradation of target mRNAs. miR-145 is a candidate tumor suppressor in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Colorectal carcinogenesis involves deregulation of cellular processes controlled by a number of intertwined chief transcription factors, such as PPARγ and SOX9. Since PPAR family members are able to modulate complex miRNAs networks, we hypothesized a role of miRNA-145 in the interaction between PPARγ and SOX9 in colorectal carcinogenesis. To address this issue, we evaluated gene expression in tissue specimens of CRC patients and we took advantage of invitro models represented by CRC derived cell lines (CaCo2, SW480, HCT116, and HT-29), employing PPARγ activation and/or miRNA-145 ectopic overexpression to analyze how their interplay impact the expression of SOX9 and the development of a malignant phenotype.
Results
PPARγ regulates the expression of miR-145 by directly binding to a PPAR response element (PPRE) in its promoter at −1207/−1194bp from the transcription start site. The binding is essential for miR-145 upregulation by PPARγ upon rosiglitazone treatment. Ectopic expression of miR-145, in turn, regulates SOX9 expression through the binding to specific seed motifs. The PPARγ-miR-145-SOX9 axis overarches cell cycle progression, invasiveness and differentiation of CRC derived cell lines. Together, these results suggest that miR-145 is a novel target of PPARγ, acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC cell lines and is a key regulator of intestinal cell differentiation by directly targeting SOX9, a marker of undifferentiated progenitors in the colonic crypts.

Abstract: The Type III Secretion System (T3SS) is a multi-mega Dalton apparatus assembled from more than twenty components and is found in many species of animal and plant bacterial pathogens. The T3SS creates a contiguous channel through the bacterial and host membranes, allowing injection of specialized bacterial effector proteins directly to the host cell. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of T3SS assembly and structure, as well as highlight structurally characterized Salmonella effectors.

Abstract: An evolutionary approach to increase the cell efficiency of the industrially widely used Al-BSF Si solar cell design is the implementation of a lightly doped emitter and plated Ni–Ag front side contacts. This work shows that this approach can give a significant advantage to fully screen printed solar cells with cell efficiencies up to 19%. However, the adhesion of the plated contacts strongly depends on the tempering induced silicidation of the Ni layer. The application of macroscopic and microscopic characterization techniques indicates that the tempering induces local non-ohmic shunts due to a silicide spiking in the space charge region. The application of an additional selective emitter doping in this experiment could decrease the shunting probability but could not prevent it completely due to inhomogeneous doping depths on the textured surface.

Abstract: Helicobacter pylori colonises the gastric epithelial cells of half of the world's population and represents a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. In gastric epithelial cells H. pylori induces the immediate early response transcription factor nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NF-κB) and the innate immune response. We show that H. pylori induces in a type IV secretion system-dependent (T4SS) and cytotoxin associated gene A protein (CagA)-independent manner a transient activation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) kinase (IKK)-complex. IKKα and IKKβ expression stabilises the regulatory IKK complex subunit NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). We provide evidence for an intimate mutual control of the IKK complex by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) and transforming growth factor β activated kinase 1 (TAK1). TAK1 interacts transiently with the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Protein modifications in the TAK1 molecule, e.g. TAK1 autophosphorylation and K63-linked ubiquitinylation, administer NF-κB signalling including transient recruitment of the IKK-complex. Overall, our data uncover H. pylori-induced interactions and protein modifications of the IKK complex, and its upstream regulatory factors involved in NF-κB activation.

Abstract: Enhanced lithium electrochromic performance of flexible tungsten oxide films by the addition of tantalum with an atmospheric pressure plasma jet in a rapid synthesis onto flexible 40Ω/□ polyethylene terephthalate/indium tin oxide substrates was investigated. The flexible organic–inorganic hybrid composites WOyCz, WTaxOyCz and TaOyCz films were synthesized by injecting the precursors tungsten carbonyl [W(CO)6] and/or tantalum ethoxide [Ta(OC2H5)] into an air plasma jet under an atmospheric pressure and the ambient temperature (~23°C). The addition of tantalum into tungsten oxide films improves the optical modulation (ΔT) from 62.3% to 74.8% (at a wavelength of 800nm, even after 200 cycles of reversible Li+ ion intercalation/de-intercalation in a 1M LiClO4-propylene carbonate electrolyte), reduces the coloration time from 13s to 8s, and increases the diffusion coefficient of the lithium ion from 0.4×10−10cm2/s to 1.2×10−10cm2/s.

Abstract: Yeast Fba1 (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase) is a glycolytic enzyme essential for viability. The overproduction of Fba1 enables overcoming of a severe growth defect caused by a missense mutation rpc128-1007 in a gene encoding the C128 protein, the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase III complex. The suppression of the growth phenotype by Fba1 is accompanied by enhanced de novo tRNA transcription in rpc128-1007 cells. We inactivated residues critical for the catalytic activity of Fba1. Overproduction of inactive aldolase still suppressed the rpc128-1007 phenotype, indicating that the function of this glycolytic enzyme in RNA polymerase III transcription is independent of its catalytic activity. Yeast Fba1 was determined to interact with the RNA polymerase III complex by coimmunoprecipitation. Additionally, a role of aldolase in control of tRNA transcription was confirmed by ChIP experiments. The results indicate a novel direct relationship between RNA polymerase III transcription and aldolase.

Abstract: Orexin-A and Orexin-B play important roles in many physiological processes in which Orexins orchestrate diverse downstream effects via two G-protein coupled receptors: Orexin1R and Orexin2R. Two alternative C-terminus splice variants of the mouse Orexin receptors mOX2αR and mOX2βR have recently been identified. This study explored the possibility of heterodimerization between mOX2αR and mOX2βR, and investigated novel signal transduction characteristics after stimulation. The dimerization of mOX2αR and mOX2βR was confirmed by BRET and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Meanwhile, in HEK293 cells, co-expression of mOX2αR and mOX2βR resulted in a strengthened increase in activation of ERK1/2, with maximal activation at 5min and 100nM. Furthermore, heterodimerization also elicits stronger intracellular Ca2+ elevation after Orexin(s) stimulation, followed by a slower decline in intracellular Ca2+ to a steady endpoint. Protein Kinase C Inhibitor significantly inhibited these downstream effects. In addition, the cAMP response element reporter activities were significantly reduced, whereas the serum response element luciferase and the T-lymphocyte activation of nuclear factor-responsive element reporter activity were significantly up-regulated after Orexin(s) stimulation. Besides, Orexin-A/-B induced a significantly higher rate of HEK293 cell proliferation in cells co-expressing mOX2αR/mOX2βR compared to the control group. Taken together, we provide conclusive evidence that mOX2αR can form a functional heterodimer with mOX2βR and this leads to increased PKC and decreased protein kinase A activity by ERK signal pathway leading to a significant increase in cell proliferation. The nature of this signaling pathway has significant implications for the role of Orexin in the regulation of physiological processes including the homeostasis of feeding.

Abstract: Development of thermal energy storage (TES) systems for concentrated solar power (CSP) is essential in order to match a variable electricity demand with an intermittent energy source supply, enhancing energy generation dispatchability. The high energy storage densities and the possibility of working at higher temperature ranges make thermochemical heat storage (TCS) via reduction–oxidation (redox) cycles of metal oxides a promising concept for energy storage. For this purpose, manganese and cobalt oxides have been selected as feasible candidates due to their favourable thermodynamic properties. In order to explore the potential of these materials, the capacity of both pure (Mn2O3 and Co3O4) and mixed oxides (Mn3−xCoxO4) to withstand several charge–discharge cycles was evaluated by thermogravimetrical analysis. Results showed better cyclability for the mixed oxides with low Mn content (x≥2.94) and, specially, for the corresponding pure oxides, confirming that these materials may be a viable option for TCS.

Abstract: We investigate the photodegradation in inert atmosphere of (poly 3-hexylthiophene:[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) (P3HT:PCBM) heterojunction solar cells under continuous illumination using advanced electrical characterization and a device modeling tool. Our results indicate that different failure mechanisms contribute to the performance loss. The first 250h of illumination induced p-type doping and recombination related to traps in the blend which mainly decreases the short-circuit current and the efficiency of the cells. Device modeling and simulation allowed us to prove that increased p-type doping of the blend provoke the loss in the short-circuit current and the quantum efficiency by simultaneous reduction of charge carrier mobility and the electric field together with a shrink of the space charge region. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements reveal a change in the blend morphology upon long illumination times manifested by phase segregation in the blend. The reduction in the open-circuit voltage is reported to be related to a slight reduction of the charge transfer energy (CT) upon 700h of illumination aging. The final failure mechanism was a rapid drop in the fill factor which occurs upon 1000h of illumination and manifested by the appearance of an S-shape J–V characteristic. This failure mechanism is linked to the reduction of charge extraction caused by a reduced surface recombination velocity at the contacts.

Abstract: Although δ-catenin was first considered as a brain specific protein, strong evidence of δ-catenin overexpression in various cancers, including prostate cancer, has been accumulated. Phosphorylation of δ-catenin by Akt and GSK3β has been studied in various cell lines. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of δ-catenin in prostate cancer cells remains unknown. In the current study, we demonstrated that Src kinase itself phosphorylates δ-catenin on its tyrosine residues in prostate cancer cells and further illustrated that Y1073, Y1112 and Y1176 of δ-catenin are predominant sites responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by c-Src. Apart from c-Src, other Src family kinases, including Fgr, Fyn and Lyn, can also phosphorylate δ-catenin. We also found that c-Src-mediated Tyr-phosphorylation of δ-catenin increases its stability via decreasing its affinity to GSK3β and enhances its ability of inducing nuclear distribution of β-catenin through interrupting the integrity of the E-cadherin. Taken together, these results indicate that c-Src can enhance the oncogenic function of δ-catenin in prostate cancer cells.

Abstract: p300 is a transcription cofactor for a number of nuclear proteins. Most studies of p300 have focused on the regulation of its function, which primarily includes its role as a transcription co-factor for a number of nuclear proteins. In this study, we found that p300 was highly phosphorylated and its level was decreased during mitosis and tumorigenesis. In vitro and in vivo experiments aimed showed that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and ERK1/2 phosphorylated p300 on Ser1038 and Ser2039. Mutations of Ser1038 and Ser2039 increased p300 protein stability and levels. Inhibition of p300 degradation by blocking its phosphorylation decreased the proliferation and metastasis activity of lung cancer cells, indicating that p300 acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer tumorigenesis. Investigation of the molecular mechanism showed that blocking p300 phosphorylation disrupted chromatin condensation and the increased the acetylation of histone H3. Analysis of cell cycle progression in HA-p300-S2A-expressing cells by flow cytometry showed that the p300 mutants arrested the cells at S-phase or delayed the mitotic entry and exit. The expression of several important oncogenes, MMP-9, vimentin, β-catenin, N-cadherin and c-myc, was negatively regulated by p300. In conclusion, during lung tumorigenesis, a phosphorylation-mediated decrease in p300 level enhanced oncogene expression during interphase and decreased histone H3 acetylation during mitosis, which promoted lung cancer progression.

Abstract: Modeling of multi-crystalline silicon solar cells has been recently widely used for fast and cost-effective performance improvements. The optimization of device performance requires deep understanding of the opto-electrical losses in a fabricated solar cell. To carry out trustworthy simulations for performance analysis and optimization, the simulation program has to be calibrated to the performance of the fabricated device. In this article an accurate opto-electrical modeling of multi-crystalline silicon solar cells is presented. Specific issues that arose during the calibration process were addressed, such as the optical model describing light scattering due to wafer texturing, the electrical modeling of heavily doped emitter and the opto-electrical modeling of the back surface field. Calibrated model parameters, obtained from theory or measurements, led to an excellent simultaneous matching between simulated and measured reflectance spectrum, internal and external quantum efficiencies and dark and illuminated current–voltage characteristics of the multi-crystalline silicon solar cells. In addition, opto-electrical losses in the investigated solar cells were determined and quantified.

Abstract: An encapsulant in a Photovoltiac (PV) module is a polymer used for binding all the components together. It also provides protection of cells and interconnects from moisture, foreign impurities and mechanical damage. In addition to this, the encapsulant must possess certain desirable characteristics such as low cost, high transmittance of light, good thermal conduction and long operating range. The provision of such properties makes it a vital component on which the performance of a PV module depends. Currently, the PV industry is dominated with Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) as an encapsulant, mostly due to its low cost. Other polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyvinyl butyral (PVB), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and Ionomer have gained interest and are being tested for better encapsulation of PV modules. The current work deals with the comparison of the mentioned encapsulants and selecting the optimum one based on its properties such as light transmittance, UV durability, electrical insulation, water vapor transmission rate and cost. The structural life of PV module is also compared by using these encapsulants. For this purpose, previously developed structural and thermal models are coupled with electrical and life-prediction models to determine efficiency and life of PV module for each encapsulant case. Life prediction of PV module encapsulant is based on a year's data of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia where the interconnect crack initiation defines failure. Under these assumptions, a detailed structural analysis has been carried out. Finally, the results of simulation combined with the other outcomes of literature are used in a decision matrix to give Ionomer to be an optimum encapsulant for PV module.

Abstract: Despite genetic variation has the potential to arise new protein functions, spontaneous mutations usually destabilize the native fold. Misfolded proteins tend to form cytotoxic intracellular aggregates, decreasing cell fitness and leading to degenerative disorders in humans. Therefore, it is thought that selection against protein misfolding and aggregation constrains the evolution of protein sequences. However, obtaining experimental data to validate this hypothesis has been traditionally difficult. Here we exploit bacteria as a model organism to address this question. Using variants of the Alzheimer's related Aβ42 peptide designed to exhibit different in vivo aggregation propensities we show here that, in cell competition experiments, the most aggregation-prone variants are always purged out from the growing population. Flow cytometry analysis of cellular metabolism and viability demonstrates that this purifying effect responds to a clear correlation between physiological burden and intrinsic aggregation propensity. Interestingly, the fitness cost of aggregation appears to be associated with aggregation rates rather than with overall protein solubility. Accordingly, we show that, by reducing in vivo aggregation rates, the model osmolyte proline is able to buffer the metabolic impact of protein aggregation. Overall, our data provide experimental support for the role of toxic protein aggregation on the cell fitness landscape and the evolution of natural protein sequences.

Abstract: Embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which are considered to be malignant counterparts of embryonic stem cells, comprise the pluripotent stem cell component of teratocarcinomas, a form of testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs). Nevertheless, many established human EC cell lines are nullipotent with limited or no capacity to differentiate under normal circumstances. In this study, we tested whether an over-expression of Yamanaka's reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4 might enable differentiation of the human nullipotent EC cells N2102Ep. Using OCT4 knockdown differentiated N2102Ep cells, we are able to derive reprogrammed N2102Ep cell lines. The induced pluripotency of N2102Ep allows the cells to differentiate toward neural lineage by retinoic acid; the expression of SSEA3 and SSEA4 is down-regulated, whereas that of neural surface markers is up-regulated. Consistent with the up-regulation of neural surface markers, the expression of the master neuroectodermal transcription factor PAX6 is also induced in reprogrammed N2102Ep. We next investigated whether PAX6 might induce spontaneous differentiation of nullipotent stem cells N2102Ep. However, while an ectopic expression of PAX6 promotes differentiation of NTERA2, it induces cell death in N2102Ep. We nevertheless find that upon induction of retinoic acid, the reprogrammed N2102Ep cells form mature neuronal morphology similar to differentiated pluripotent stem cells NTERA2 as determined by TUJ1 expression, which is absent in N2102Ep parental cells. Altogether, we conclude that the nullipotent state of human EC cells can be reprogrammed to acquire a more relaxed state of differentiation potential by Yamanaka's factors.

Characterization of novel store-operated calcium entry effectors,

Abstract: 2-Aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) is a well-known effector of the store-operated Ca2+ entry of several cell types such as immune cells, platelets and smooth muscle cells. 2-APB has a dual effect: potentiation at 1–5μM and inhibition at >30μM. Unfortunately, it is also able to modify the activity of other Ca2+ transporters and, thus, cannot be used as a therapeutic tool to control the leukocyte activity in diseases like inflammation. Previously, we have shown that SOCE potentiation by 2-APB depends on the presence of the central boron-oxygen core (BOC) and that the phenyl groups determine the sensitivity of the molecule to inhibit and/or potentiate the SOCE. We hypothesized that by modifying the two phenyl groups of 2-APB, we could identify more efficient and specific analogues. In fact, the addition of methoxyl groups to one phenyl group greatly decreased the potentiation ability without any significant effect on the inhibition. Surprisingly, when the free rotation of the two phenyl groups was blocked by a new hydrocarbon bridge, the BOC was no longer able to potentiate. Furthermore, larger aryl groups than phenyl also impaired the activity of the BOC. Thus, the potentiation site in the Ca2+ channel is not accessible by the BOC when the lateral groups are too large or unable to freely rotate. However, these molecules are potent inhibitors of store-operated calcium entry with affinities below 1μM, and they can block the activation of the Jurkat T cells. Thus, it is possible to characterize 2-APB analogues with different properties that could be the first step in the discovery of new immunomodulators. This article is part of a special issue entitled “Calcium Signaling in Health and Disease. Guest Editors: Geert Bultynck, Jacques Haiech, Claus W. Heizmann, Joachim Krebs, and Marc Moreau.

Abstract: Cultured mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from different sources represent a heterogeneous population of proliferating non-differentiated cells that contains multipotent stem cells capable of originating a variety of mesenchymal cell lineages. Despite tremendous progress in MSC biology spurred by their therapeutic potential, current knowledge on receptor and signaling systems of MSCs is mediocre. Here we isolated MSCs from the human adipose tissue and assayed their responsivity to GPCR agonists with Ca2+ imaging. As a whole, a MSC population exhibited functional heterogeneity. Although a variety of first messengers was capable of stimulating Ca2+ signaling in MSCs, only a relatively small group of cells was specifically responsive to the particular GPCR agonist, including noradrenaline. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry revealed expression of α1B-, α2A-, and β2-adrenoreceptors in MSCs. Their sensitivity to subtype-specific adrenergic agonists/antagonists and certain inhibitors of Ca2+ signaling indicated that largely the α2A-isoform coupled to PLC endowed MSCs with sensitivity to noradrenaline. The all-or-nothing dose-dependence was characteristic of responsivity of robust adrenergic MSCs. Noradrenaline never elicited small or intermediate responses but initiated large and quite similar Ca2+ transients at all concentrations above the threshold. The inhibitory analysis and Ca2+ uncaging implicated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in shaping Ca2+ signals elicited by noradrenaline. Evidence favored IP3 receptors as predominantly responsible for CICR. Based on the overall findings, we inferred that adrenergic transduction in MSCs includes two fundamentally different stages: noradrenaline initially triggers a local and relatively small Ca2+ signal, which next stimulates CICR, thereby being converted into a global Ca2+ signal.

Identification of NuRSERY, a new functional HDAC complex composed by HDAC5, GATA1, EKLF and pERK present in human erythroid cells,

Abstract: To clarify the role of HDACs in erythropoiesis, expression, activity and function of class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3) and class IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5) HDACs during in vitro maturation of human erythroblasts were compared. During erythroid maturation, expression of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 remained constant and activity and GATA1 association (its partner of the NuRD complex), of HDAC1 increased. By contrast, HDAC4 content drastically decreased and HDAC5 remained constant in content but decreased in activity. In erythroid cells, pull down experiments identified the presence of a novel complex formed by HDAC5, GATA1, EKLF and pERK which was instead undetectable in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage. With erythroid maturation, association among HDAC5, GATA1 and EKLF persisted but levels of pERK sharply decreased. Treatment of erythroleukemic cells with inhibitors of ERK phosphorylation reduced by >90% the total and nuclear content of HDAC5, GATA1 and EKLF, suggesting that ERK phosphorylation is required for the formation of this complex. Based on the function of class IIa HDACs as chaperones of other proteins to the nucleus and the erythroid-specificity of HDAC5 localization, this novel HDAC complex was named nuclear remodeling shuttle erythroid (NuRSERY). Exposure of erythroid cells to the class II-selective HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) APHA9 increased γ/(γ+β) globin expression ratios (Mai et al., 2007), suggesting that NuRSERY may regulate globin gene expression. In agreement with this hypothesis, exposure of erythroid cells to APHA9 greatly reduced the association among HDAC5, GATA1 and EKLF. Since exposure to APHA9 did not affect survival rates or p21 activation, NuRSERY may represent a novel, possibly less toxic, target for epigenetic therapies of hemoglobinopaties and other disorders.

Abstract: A scenario for future silicon photovoltaics is to use wafer-based solar cells with a thickness below 100μm. A way to realize this scenario is the merging of cell and module processing, with thin wafers processed while attached to the superstrate glass. One of the challenges for this type of processing is the achievement of high performing surface passivation, i.e., with surface recombination velocities below 10cm/s. In this paper, a detailed explanation for lifetime degradation on wafers bonded to glass by means of silicone is proposed. The degradation is due to cyclic silicone molecules outgassing during a-Si:H deposition from the adhesive used to bond the wafers. The cyclic molecules are incorporated in the a-Si:H layer and modify the amorphous silicon network. By the application of specific outgassing conditions before a-Si:H deposition, a significant amount of cyclic molecules is removed from the adhesive. Non-degraded a-Si:H layers and surface passivation comparable to standalone wafers are obtained, as shown with measures of lifetime and solar cell open circuit voltage.

Abstract: To fabricate long lifetime polymer solar cells, understanding the fundamental aspects controlling the performances, stability and degradation of the devices is essential. In this study, we compare the chemical and electrical degradation behaviors of polymer solar cells based on active layers of semi-crystalline p-type polymer poly(3hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and different fullerene derivatives as acceptors. Photodegradation study by UV–visible and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and photovoltaic performance study by current–voltage measurement were done to understand and compare air stability of P3HT blended with different fullerenes. The used acceptors are indene-C(60) bisadduct (ICBA) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The obtained results show that solar cells fabricated from PCBM as acceptor are more stable than those based on ICBA. Based on the spectroscopic and electrical measurement results, it is safe to conclude that PCBM contributes more to stability of P3HT than ICBA, and that the degradation behavior is compatible with recently proposed mechanisms. Chemical properties of ICBA such as the low electron affinity could be responsible for the relative low stability of the device.

Abstract: Podosomes are integrin-based adhesions fundamental for stabilisation of the leading lamellae in migrating dendritic cells (DCs) and for extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. We have previously shown that soluble factors and chemokines such as SDF 1-a trigger podosome initiation whereas integrin ligands promote podosome maturation and stability in DCs. The exact intracellular signalling pathways that regulate the sequential organisation of podosomal components in response to extracellular cues remain largely undetermined. The Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) mediates actin polymerisation and the initial recruitment of integrins and associated proteins in a circular configuration surrounding the core of filamentous actin (F-actin) during podosome initiation. We have now identified integrin linked kinase (ILK) surrounding the podosomal actin core. We report that DC polarisation in response to chemokines and the assembly of actin cores during podosome initiation require PI3K-dependent clustering of the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) in puncta independently of ILK. ILK is essential for the clustering of integrins and associated proteins leading to podosome maturation and stability that are required for degradation of the subjacent extracellular matrix and the invasive motility of DCs across connective tissue barriers. We conclude that WASP regulates DCs polarisation for migration and initiation of actin polymerisation downstream of PI3K in nascent podosomes. Subsequently, ILK mediates the accumulation of integrin-associated proteins during podosome maturation and stability for efficient degradation of the subjacent ECM during the invasive migration of DCs.

Abstract: Wnt signaling determines human stromal (mesenchymal) stem cell (hMSC) differentiation fate into the osteoblast or adipocyte lineage. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules of 21–25 nucleotides that regulate many aspects of osteoblast biology. Thus, we examined miRNAs regulated by Wnt signaling in hMSC. We identified miRNA (miR)-141-3p as a Wnt target which in turn inhibited Wnt signaling. Moreover, miR-141-3p inhibited hMSC proliferation by arresting cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. miR-141-3p inhibited osteoblast differentiation of hMSC as evidenced by reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, gene expression and in vitro mineralized matrix formation. Bioinformatic studies, Western blot analysis and 3’UTR reporter assay demonstrated that cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) is a direct target of miR-141-3p. siRNA-mediated knock-down of CDC25A inhibited hMSC proliferation and osteoblast differentiation. In summary, miR-141-3p acts as a negative regulator of hMSC proliferation and osteoblast differentiation. Targeting miR-141-3p could be used as an anabolic therapy of low bone mass diseases, e.g. osteoporosis.

Abstract: Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates several physiological processes such as the cell cycle, cell growth, apoptosis, and signal transduction. In this study, we examined the expression and role of PP2A Cα in adipocyte differentiation. PP2A Cα expression and PP2A activity decreased during adipocyte differentiation in C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells and the expression of adipocyte marker genes such as PPARγ and adiponectin increased. To further clarify the role of PP2A Cα in adipocyte differentiation, we constructed PP2A knockdown cells by infecting C3H10T1/2 cells with a lentivirus expressing a shRNA specific for the PP2A Cα (shPP2A cells). Silencing of PP2A Cα in C3H10T1/2 cells dramatically stimulated adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, which were accompanied by expression of adipocyte marker genes. Silencing of PP2A Cα suppressed Wnt10b expression and reduced the levels of the inactivated form of GSK-3β (phospho-GSK-3β), leading to the reduction of β-catenin levels in the nucleus and its transcriptional activity. Treatment with LiCl, a GSK-3β inhibitor, and inhibition of PPARγ expression suppressed the accelerated adipogenesis of shPP2A cells. Our data indicate that PP2A Cα plays an important role in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation by regulating the Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway and PPARγ expression.

A homolog of the MC (membrane-coating) proteins of eukaryotes has been proposed to be involved in the mechanism of this process, but its relationship to eukaryote proteins is controversial. However, a number of other proteins of G. obscuriglobus with domains homologous to those involved in endocytosis in eukaryotes can also be identified. Here we critically evaluate current bioinformatic knowledge, and suggest practical experimental steps to overcome the limits of bioinformatics in elucidating the molecular mechanism of endocytosis in bacteria. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Protein trafficking and secretion in bacteria. Guest Editors: Anastassios Economou and Ross Dalbey.

Abstract: NK cell is an innate immune system lymphocyte lineage with natural cytotoxicity. Its optimal use in the clinic requires in vitro expansion and activation. Cytokines and encounter with target cells activate NK cells and induce proliferation, and this could depend on the presence of other immune cells. Here we activated PBMCs during 5 days with IL-2, with IL-2 plus the tumor cell line K562 and with the lymphoblastoid cell line R69 and perform integrated analyses of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles of purified NK cells. The samples cluster depending on the stimuli and not on the donor, indicating that the pattern of NK cell stimulation is acutely well conserved between individuals. Regulation of mRNA expression is tighter than that of miRNA expression. All stimuli induce a common preserved genetic remodeling. In addition, encounter with target cells mainly activates pathways related to metabolism. Different target cells induce different NK cell remodeling which affects cytokine response and cytotoxicity, supporting the notion that encounter with different target cells significantly changing the activation pattern. We validate our analysis by showing that activation down regulates miR-23a, which is a negative regulator of cathepsin C (CTSC) mRNA, a gene up regulated by all stimuli. The peptidase CTSC activates the granzymes, the main effector proteases involved in NK cell cytotoxicity. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which induces miR-23a expression, decreases CTSC expression and granzyme B activity leading to impaired NK cell cytotoxicity in an in vivo mouse model.

Abstract: Aurora A kinase regulates early mitotic events through phosphorylation and activation of a variety of proteins. Specifically, Aur-A is involved in centrosomal separation and formation of mitotic spindles in early prophase. The effect of Aur-A on mitotic spindles is mediated by the modulation of microtubule dynamics and association with microtubule binding proteins. In this study we show that Aur-A exerts its effects on spindle organization through the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Aurora A phosphorylates Cofilin at multiple sites including S3 resulting in the inactivation of its actin depolymerizing function. Aur-A interacts with Cofilin in early mitotic phases and regulates its phosphorylation status. Cofilin phosphorylation follows a dynamic pattern during the progression of prophase to metaphase. Inhibition of Aur-A activity induced a delay in the progression of prophase to metaphase. Aur-A inhibitor also disturbed the pattern of Cofilin phosphorylation, which correlated with the mitotic delay. Our results establish a novel function of Aur-A in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, through Cofilin phosphorylation during early mitotic stages.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 enhances ligand-dependent and -independent activity of estrogen receptor α via distinct mechanisms,

Abstract: Recent studies reported that protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) enhances estrogen-induced activity of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and dysfunction of PRMT6 is associated with overall better survival for ERα-positive breast cancer patients. However, it is unclear how PRMT6 promotes ERα activity. Here we report that PRMT6 specifically interacts with ERα at its ligand-binding domain. PRMT6 also methylates ERα both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to enhancing estrogen-induced ERα activity, PRMT6 over-expression up-regulates estrogen-independent activity of ERα and PRMT6 gene silencing in MCF7 cells inhibits ligand-independent ERα activation. More interestingly, the effect of PRMT6 on the ligand-independent ERα activity does not require its methyltransferase activity. Instead, PRMT6 competes with Hsp90 for ERα binding: PRMT6 and Hsp90 bindings to ERα are mutually exclusive and PRMT6 over-expression reduces ERα interaction with Hsp90. In conclusion, PRMT6 requires its methyltransferase activity to enhance ERα's ligand-induced activity, but its effect on ligand-independent activity is likely mediated through competing with Hsp90 for binding to the C-terminal domain of ERα. PRMT6-ERα interaction would prevent ERα-Hsp90 association. Since Hsp90 and associated chaperones serve to maintain ERα conformation for ligand-binding yet functionally inactive, inhibition of ERα-Hsp90 interaction would relieve ERα from the constraint of chaperone complex.

Abstract: This work reports on indium tin oxide (ITO)-free organic solar cells with roll to roll (R2R) processed organic functional layers. The device stack comprises a chromium–aluminum–chromium (Cr–Al–Cr) electron contact layer on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, a photoactive layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): (6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a hole transport layer of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and a silver (Ag) grid for current collection. For the photoactive layer the non-halogenated solvent o-Xylene was used in order to reduce the impact on health and environment for R2R coating on ambient atmospheric conditions. The Cr–Al–Cr layers were sputtered onto the PET rolls in a batch process while the photoactive layer as well as the hole transport layer were applied in a continuous R2R process by slot die coating. The Ag grid was either thermally evaporated through a shadow mask as reference process or deposited by aerosol printing as a more production compatible process. Device efficiencies up to 2.9% on an active area of 1.1cm2 were obtained with no difference for the method of grid processing. These experimental results demonstrate that R2R coated organic functional layers in ITO-free devices obtain the same device performance as compared to spin coated laboratory cells.

Abstract: Single-crystal Czochralski silicon used for photovoltaics is typically supersaturated with interstitial oxygen at temperatures just below the melting point. Oxide precipitates therefore can form during ingot cooling and cell processing, and nucleation sites are typically vacancy-rich regions. Oxygen precipitation gives rise to recombination centres, which can reduce cell efficiencies by as much as 4% (absolute). We have studied the recombination behaviour in p-type and n-type monocrystalline silicon with a range of doping levels intentionally processed to contain oxide precipitates with a range of densities, sizes and morphologies. We analyse injection-dependent minority carrier lifetime measurements to give a full parameterisation of the recombination activity in terms of Shockley–Read–Hall statistics. We intentionally contaminate specimens with iron, and show recombination activity arises from iron segregated to oxide precipitates and surrounding defects. We find that phosphorus diffusion gettering reduces the recombination activity of the precipitates to some extent. We also find that bulk iron is preferentially gettered to the phosphorus diffused layer rather than to oxide precipitates.

Heparanase is a key player in renal fibrosis by regulating TGF-β expression and activity,

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tubular cells is one of the mechanisms which contribute to renal fibrosis and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is one of the main triggers. Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-β-D-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan-sulfate thus regulating the bioavailability of growth factors (FGF-2, TGF-β). HPSE controls FGF-2-induced EMT in tubular cells and is necessary for the development of diabetic nephropathy in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HPSE can modulate the expression and the effects of TGF-β in tubular cells. First we proved that the lack of HPSE or its inhibition prevents the increased synthesis of TGF-β by tubular cells in response to pro-fibrotic stimuli such as FGF-2, advanced glycosylation end products (AGE) and albumin overload. Second, since TGF-β may derive from sources different from tubular cells, we investigated whether HPSE modulates tubular cell response to exogenous TGF-β. HPSE does not prevent EMT induced by TGF-β although it slows its onset; indeed in HPSE-silenced cells the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype does not develop as quickly as in wt cells. Additionally, TGF-β induces an autocrine loop to sustain its signal, whereas the lack of HPSE partially interferes with this autocrine loop. Overall these data confirm that HPSE is a key player in renal fibrosis since it interacts with the regulation and the effects of TGF-β. HPSE is needed for pathological TGF-β overexpression in response to pro-fibrotic factors. Furthermore, HPSE modulates TGF-β-induced EMT: the lack of HPSE delays tubular cell transdifferentiation, and impairs the TGF-β autocrine loop.

Abstract: In this work, we design and compare two intermediate layers (IMLs) for solution-processed tandem organic solar cells. The IMLs are made of PEDOT as the hole transport layer (HTL) coupled with either TiOx or ZnO nanoparticles as the electron transport layer (ETL). The IMLs are characterized with regard to the requirements usually found in the literature: process robustness, work function compatibilities, good optical transparency, good electrical conductivity, and finally, the effective presence of an ohmic contact between the ETL and the HTL. Specifically designed single and tandem cells are then made to compare the performances of the two IMLs. We show that the ohmic contact is the most important criterion, which has to be carefully probed in order to design a functional IML. We offer recommendations on how to properly investigate this property. We also show that the nature of the ETL/HTL contact cannot be predicted from the results of the materials characterization, particularly not from the work functions and neither from the conductivities. Finally, XPS and work function experiments suggest that the nature of the contact depends on phenomena arising at the interface between the HTL and the ETL. Specifically, a chemical interaction is observed between ZnO and PEDOT within the IML. We conclude that a ZnO-based IML is a better choice than a TiOx-based IML.

Abstract: Plasmonics is an emerging area of study for photovoltaic applications. The last decade has seen an increasing interest in the application of metal nanoparticles (MNP) on the surface of solar cells to scatter light and subsequently achieve light trapping. In this study we investigate the optical effects of single and double layer rear light trapping reflectors – planar or scattering; direct or detached, which are fabricated on the 400μm front-planar silicon solar cells. As a single layer reflecting scheme, we find that Ag metal nanoparticles (Ag MNP) as a scattering reflector outperforms all other single layer reflectors with a maximum current enhancement of 11% (calculated from 900nm to 1200nm) compared to metal back reflectors. However over time we notice that the scattering properties are dampened due to tarnishing of the silver nanoparticles. A double layer reflecting scheme using optimised Ag nanoparticles as the first layer and the second layer of evaporated Ag (E Ag) separated via MgF2 is introduced to overcome this issue together with additional light trapping. We find that no EQE or current degradation is observed over time. More importantly, after optimising the over-coating MgF2 thickness, the best-performing double layer reflector structure improves EQE by 4.5-fold at 1160nm and enhances photocurrent by 25.6% (calculated from 900nm to 1200nm), compared to cells with metal back reflectors. We also conclude that the optimum thickness of the over-coating layer is dependent on the wavelength to be optimised, the angular distribution of the plasmonic nanoparticles scattering within the layer, and the type of adjacent metal reflector used. It performs best when condition for constructive interference or enhanced electric field at the rear Si interface is satisfied. An enhancement of effective optical path length factor Z of around 9-fold compared to an Al reflector is achieved by using the optimised double layer reflector, higher than the 6-fold enhancement reported previously.

Abstract: Acrolein, a highly reactive α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, is a product of endogenous lipid peroxidation. It is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant that is generated mainly by smoke, overheated cooking oil and vehicle exhaust. Acrolein damages cellular proteins, which could lead to accumulation of aberrantly-folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This study determines the mechanisms involved in acrolein-induced apoptosis mediated by the ER and possible links with the ER stress response in human A549 lung cells. The exposure of cells to acrolein (15–50μM) for shorter times of 15 to 30min activated several ER stress markers. These included the ER chaperone protein BiP and the three ER sensors: (i) the survival/rescue molecules protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) were phosphorylated; (ii) cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) occurred, and (iii) inositol-requiring protein-1 alpha (IRE1α) was phosphorylated. Acrolein (25–50μM) caused apoptotic cell death mediated by the ER after 2h, which was characterised by the induction of CHOP and activation of ER proteases calpain and caspase-4. Calpain and caspase-7 were the initiating factors for caspase-4 activation in acrolein-induced apoptosis. These results increase our knowledge about cellular responses to acrolein in lung cells, which have implications for human health.

Abstract: It is well known that TGF-β1 plays a central role in renal fibrosis due in large part to stimulation of inflammatory responses. KCa3.1, a potassium channel protein, has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for diseases such as sickle cell anemia, autoimmunity, atherosclerosis and more recently, kidney fibrosis. Blockade of KCa3.1 has been shown to ameliorate renal fibrosis in diabetic mice in association with reduced TGF-β1 signaling. However, the centrality of KCa3.1 activation to TGF-β1 induced inflammation remains unknown. In this study, human proximal tubular cells (HK2 cells) were incubated with TGF-β1 (2ng/ml) for 48h in the presence or absence of KCa3.1 siRNA or the KCa3.1 inhibitor TRAM34. HK2 cells overexpressing KCa3.1 were studied in parallel. The mRNA and protein expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Downstream TGF-β1 signaling molecules Smad3, p38 and ERK1/2 were measured by Western blot analysis. Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques we found that TGFβ-1 induced a large KCa3.1 K-current that was inhibited by TRAM34. TGF-β1 also increased MCP-1 mRNA and protein expression in HK2 cells compared to control, an effect that was reversed by in the presence of KCa3.1 siRNA. Similarly, TRAM34 significantly reduced the TGF-β1-mediated increase in MCP-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Inhibition of KCa3.1 with KCa3.1 siRNA or TRAM34 also reduced TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad3, p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways. Conversely overexpression of KCa3.1 induced TGF-β1 signaling cascades and expression of MCP-1. The present study is consistent with a key role for KCa3.1 renal proximal tubular cells in mediating the TGF-β1 induction of MCP-1 expression in HK2 cells via Smad3, p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways.

Abstract: A novel selective coating material based on Mo–Si3N4 has been investigated for the first time. Accurate combination of the individual component layers based on optical simulations and precise control of layers thickness and composition leads to high solar absorptivity (αSol=0.926) and low thermal emissivity (ε25°C=0.017) on a silver film, resulting in a high solar thermal energy conversion efficiency. The tandem absorber is stable in moderate vacuum at temperatures above 600°C showing low emissivity (estimated value at 600°C is ε600°C=0.109) evidencing its relevance for high temperature solar selective applications. A full optical and thermal analysis of a parabolic trough concentrator (PTC) system confirmed the potential of the novel coating material to be used for CSP technology.

Abstract: Increased expression of miR-128a is often observed in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) compared with its expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The objective of this study was to investigate the role of miR-128a, especially that in the Fas-signalling pathway, in T-cell leukaemia cells. The role of miR-128a in Fas-mediated apoptosis was examined by using Fas-activating antibody (CH-11)-susceptible Jurkat cells and -resistant Jurkat/R cells. Whereas ectopic expression of miR-128a conferred Fas-resistance on Jurkat cells by directly targeting Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), antagonizing miR-128a expression sensitized Jurkat/R cells to the Fas-mediated apoptosis through derepression of FADD expression. Myeloid leukaemia HL60 and K562 cells were also CH-11-resistant, sharing a similar resistant mechanism with Jurkat/R cells. Furthermore, CH-11 induced demethylation of the promoter region of miR-128a with resultant up-regulation of miR-128a expression in Jurkat/R cells, which was shown to be a mechanism for the resistance of Jurkat/R cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Our results indicate that the induction of miR-128a expression by DNA demethylation is a novel mechanism of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis.

Abstract: W-doped In2O3 transparent conductive film was developed at a low substrate temperature of 200°C by reactive plasma deposition technique for the applications to silicon heterojunction solar cell. The maximum Hall mobility of 89cm2/Vs with a corresponding carrier concentration of 1.6×1020cm−3 was achieved at a relatively high oxygen partial pressure of 7.2×10−4Torr without any special treatment. According to the Hall effect measurements at variable temperature from 80K to 300K, high Hall mobility was mainly attributed to the ionized impurity scattering, neutral impurity scattering and phonon scattering, grain boundary scattering only plays the minor role in the carrier transportation of IWO film in this work. Additionally, XRD results show the samples have a cubic phase of bixbyite-type In2O3 polycrystalline structure with a preferential orientation of (222) plane. The plasma wavelength of larger than 2.3μm is very beneficial for sunlight transparency. Consequently, IWO is applied to a-Si/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, 20.8% of conversion efficiency has been obtained under the optimized experimental conditions.

Abstract: A map of local short-circuit current density (JSC) of a solar cell at standard irradiance spectra is a desirable source of information for current-loss analysis and device optimization. In this work, we present a new and easily implementable method to obtain such JSC maps as well as local external quantum efficiency graphs with a spatial resolution of about 100µm, exemplified for silicon solar cells. The method is based on a pixel by pixel interpolation of external quantum efficiency maps obtained by spectrally resolved light-beam induced current measurements (SR-LBIC). The local data is integrated with an AM1.5G spectrum to obtain a JSC map with no additional measurement time beyond SR-LBIC image acquisition. The averaged currents over a map are in good agreement with global current–voltage measurements. Some of the possible applications of this method are presented and exemplified, including local quantum efficiency of a cast-mono solar cell, separation of JSC contributions from front side and bulk, quantitative determination of the electrical shading effect in IBC cells, the impact of the irradiance spectrum on local JSC for indoor photovoltaic applications and also the separation of optical and electrical current losses with newly introduced Pseudo-JSC maps based on internal quantum efficiency maps. Finally, the resulting JSC maps also present valuable information for several existing local cell-parameter imaging methods. This basic approach leads to an easily accessible, spatially resolved short-circuit current loss-analysis, which is in principle applicable to any solar cell structure.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate DBC2 mutations in breast cancer patients and evaluate the relationship between gene mutations and breast cancer susceptibility in an Eastern China population.
Methods
Mutation analyses of 285bp promoter sequence, coding exon 7 and its exon/intron boundaries of DBC2 were performed in 32 breast cancer specimens by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Eighteen benign breast tumor specimens were also analyzed as control.
Results
No mutation in the promoter or exon 7 was found in either group. An intronic alteration (IVS7+53C>G) was detected in 13 specimens. There was no significant difference in the rate of IVS7+53C>G alteration between the study and control groups (8/32 vs 5/18, respectively, P>0.05). The G allele of IVS7+53 was correlated with HER2 and p53 expression (P<0.05), but not with age, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, ER or PR expression (P>0.05).
Conclusion
Mutation in the promoter and exon 7 of DBC2 gene is not common in the Chinese population and may not contribute to the susceptibility for breast cancer in China. The intronic alteration IVS7+53C>G is a common polymorphism in the Chinese Han ethnic group. Further research is warranted to evaluate the relationship between IVS7+53C>G and the susceptibility for breast cancer.

Abstract: It is a fact that the fill factor (FF) decreases with decreasing μτ product, increasing illumination intensity, increasing absorber thickness, and long wavelength illumination in well-engineered hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells. The FF issues in the a-Si:H solar cell are not just a contact issue as in crystalline Si solar cell, but are more interesting and complicated issues that relate to the quality of materials and solar cell operating conditions. In past, a simple parameter of “collection length” or drift length, which is defined as μτE, was quite successful to explain the fact. In this article, we extensively study the collection length in terms of the internal electric field, which changes with the quality of material and operating condition. The Analysis of Microelectronic and Photonic Structures (AMPS) simulation shows that the decrease in fill factor is caused by photogenerated space charge trapped in the band-tail states rather than in defects when the defects are relatively small. This charge screens the applied field, reducing the internal field and the collection length, which reduce the FF. A voltage Vs from the photogenerated space charge was introduced to describe the behavior. This voltage varies with light intensity for large valance band-tail width and low hole mobility a-Si:H absorbers. The simulation also found that the space charge in mid-gap states is small compared with that in the tails and can be ignored under normal solar-cell operating conditions. Experimentally, the photocapacitance measurement was used as a means to probe the space charge. The decrease of FF with the increasing light intensity can be qualitatively explained by the light intensity dependence of photocapacitance, the declining electric field, and the decreasing collection length.

Abstract: CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) thin film solar modules, despite their high efficiency, may contain three different kinds of macroscopic defects referred to as bulk defects, interface defects and interconnect defects. This occurs due to film's sensitivity to inhomogeneities during the manufacturing process. The result is a decrease of electrical power output from a cell or module. In this paper, we present the influence of macroscopic defects on the electrical behavior of CIGS thin film solar cells. To accomplish this, we investigated the relation between the IR-signal emitted of a defect in a cell (measured using illuminated lock-in thermography ILIT) and the respective open circuit cell voltage (Voc,cell) under low light conditions (< 100W/m²). Furthermore, we developed a modified masking method of measuring Voc,cell of a single cell within a thin film solar module.

Abstract: Surface sulfurization of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin films was carried out using liquid ditertiarybutylsulfide [(t-C4H9)2S: DTBS] to improve the performances of CIGS-based solar cells. The initial CIGS thin films were prepared by using the conventional three-stage co-evaporation process. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scan, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence showed that the electrical and optical properties of the absorber layers were improved after sulfurization. The performances of the solar cells incorporating the CIGS films were remarkably improved when films sulfurized with DTBS were used. The efficiency of the solar cells fabricated with CIGS films increased significantly from 12.4% to 13.6% with an open-circuit voltage of 642mV, short-circuit current density of 30.95mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 68.2%. The improved cell performances can be attributed to the formation of a very thin sulfide layer on the CIGS layer and/or surface passivation by S atoms.

Abstract: We present our development of a ZnO:B back reflector (BR) with high haze and low absorption for highly efficient triple-junction thin film Si solar modules over a large area (1.1×1.3m2). We try to maximize light trapping by the evaluation of the use of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and BR for high efficiency. It was verified that the configuration of SnO2:F front TCO and ZnO:B BR shows better optical properties than typical configurations for light trapping due to its high transparency at the front and high haze at the back. In addition, we noticed that the absorption of the BR has a strong influence on the solar modules. We obtained a superior ZnO:B BR with high haze and low absorption by controlling the doping gas ratio (B2H6/DEZ). As the doping gas ratio of ZnO:B BR decreases, the haze increases due to a rougher surface morphology, and the absorption decreases due to reduced free carrier absorption. The solar modules with a ZnO:B BR in a lower doping gas ratio show relatively higher Pmax for the same i-μc-Si layer thickness. This results from an increased Isc due to higher haze and lower absorption. In addition, the ZnO:B BR with a low doping gas ratio was found to be effective in reducing the i-μc-Si layer thickness because there are more chances for trapping the light at the i-μc-Si layer. We could reduce the i-μc-Si layer thickness by about 28% for the equivalent Pmax level by lowering the doping gas ratio. We successfully applied the ZnO:B BR with high haze and low absorption into a triple-junction thin film silicon solar cell and achieved a new record, improving on our previous world record.

Abstract: We report on a novel approach including: 1. the design of an efficient intermediate layer, which facilitates the use of most high performance active materials in tandem structure and the compatibility of the tandem concept with large-scale production; 2. the concept of ternary composites based on commercially available materials, which enhances the absorption of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and as a result increase the PCE of the P3HT-based large-scale OPV devices; 3. laser-based module processing, which provides an excellent processing resolution and as a result can bring the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of mass-produced organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices close to the highest PCE values achieved for lab-scale solar cells through a significant increase in the geometrical fill factor. We believe that the combination of the above mentioned concepts provides a clear roadmap to push OPV towards large-scale production and commercial applications.

Abstract: In this work we report the role of thickness on electrochromic behavior of nickel oxide (NiO) films deposited by e-beam evaporation at room temperature on ITO-coated glass. The structure and morphology of films with thicknesses between 100 and 500nm were analyzed and then correlated with electrochemical response and transmittance modulation when immersed in 0.5M LiClO4–PC electrolyte. The NiO exhibits an anodic coloration, reaching for the thickest film a transmittance modulation of 66% between colored and bleached state, at 630nm, with a color efficiency of 55cm2C−1. Very fast switch between states was obtained, where coloration and bleaching times are 3.6scm−2 and 1.4scm−2, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the use of low-temperature-solution-processable bismuth iodide (BiI3) nanosheets as hole transport layers in organic photovoltaics with an active layer comprising poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) mixed with a fullerene derivative. The performance of the resulting devices was comparable with that of corresponding conventionally used systems incorporating polyethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). UV–vis spectroscopy revealed that the transparency of a BiI3 layer in the visible (>620nm) and near-infrared range is greater than that of a PEDOT:PSS layer. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy of a BiI3 film revealed signals at 158.8, 164, 618.6, and 630eV—characteristic of Bi 4f7/2, Bi 4f5/2, I 3d5/2, and I 3d3/2, respectively—that indicated a stoichiometric BiI3 film. Wet milling of BiI3 crystals resulted in the formation of nanosheets, the presence of which we confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. The resultant power conversion efficiency of the device was approximately 3.5%, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.56V, a short-circuit current density of 10.4mAcm–2, and a fill factor of 60.1% under AM1.5G irradiation (100mWcm−2).

Abstract: Excessive levels of the glycolysis metabolite methylglyoxal (MG) elicit enhanced expression of adhesion molecules which foster leukocyte–endothelial cell interactions. The signaling mechanisms involved remain elusive. To address this, we investigated the signal transduction of leukocyte- and endothelial-expressed phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) effector kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) in the regulation of MG-elicited leukocyte recruitment. Using intravital microscopy of mouse cremasteric microvasculature, we demonstrate that GSK3 inhibitors lithium and SB216763 mitigate MG-elicited leukocyte recruitment and microvascular hyperpermeability. In SVEC4-10EE2 endothelial cells, but not in neutrophils, MG transiently activates GSK3 by reducing inhibitory phospho-GSK3α/β (Ser21/9) which parallels decrease of phospho-Akt at early time points (<30min). At later time points (≥1h), MG induces GSK3 deactivation which is dissipated by siRNA silencing of SGK. MG treatment potentiates endothelial SGK1 mRNA, total SGK1, phospho-SGK1 and phospho-NDRG1. The SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394 attenuates MG-elicited leukocyte recruitment. Pharmacological inhibition or silencing endothelial GSK3 or SGK attenuates MG-triggered nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity. Furthermore, silencing SGK blunts MG-triggered redox-sensitive phosphorylation of endothelial transcription factor CREB. Inhibition of SGK1 or GSK3 mitigates the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules P- and E-selectins and ICAM-1. Moreover, SGK1-dependent CREB activation participates in MG-elicited ICAM-1 upregulation. We conclude that temporal activation of endothelial SGK1 and GSK3 is decisive in MG-elicited upregulation of transcription factors, adhesion molecule expression, and leukocyte-vascular endothelium interactions. This novel signaling pathway may link excessive MG levels in vivo to inflammation, thus, unraveling potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA), a widely used immunosuppressant shows cytotoxic effects by either inducing apoptosis or redirecting the cell towards non-apoptotic cell death. However, there still remains a lacuna in understanding the mechanism of CsA induced non-apoptotic cell death. In the present study we investigated calcineurin dependent or independent cytotoxic effects of CsA, a calcineurin inhibitor, in cervical cancerous SiHa cells. Decreased cell viability and massive cytoplasmic vacuolations were observed in CsA treated SiHa cells, having increased calcineurin activity. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), accompanied by a decrease in cyclophilin B (ER resident PPIase), preceded the formation of the vacuoles. These vacuoles stained positive for many ER resident markers confirming their ER origin; but the absence of autophagosomal marker, LC3II, ruled out autophagy. Extensively vacuolated cells eventually undergo cell death which lacked the typical apoptotic features, but showed significant decrease in AIP (ALG2 interacting protein) as seen in paraptosis. ER-vacuolation was prevented by cycloheximide and salubrinal thereby indicating requirement of active protein synthesis. Inhibiting calcineurin activity by either Tacrolimus (FK506) or by knockdown of calcineurin B subunit did not result in either ER-stress or cellular vacuolation. However, knockdown of cyclophilin B by siRNA resulted in increased expression of Bip and IRE1α, together with cytoplasmic vacuolation. In conclusion, we report that persistent ER stress due to cyclophilin B inhibition in CsA treated cervical cancer cells caused cellular vacuolation which culminated in a non-apoptotic cell death response similar to paraptosis. Additionally, the paraptotic effects of CsA are independent of calcineurin inhibition.

Abstract: Even though the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene product Dystrophin Dp71d is involved in various key cellular processes through its role as a scaffold for structural and signalling proteins at the plasma membrane as well as the nuclear envelope, its subcellular trafficking is poorly understood. Here we map the nuclear import and export signals of Dp71d by truncation and point mutant analysis, showing for the first time that Dp71d shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm mediated by the conventional nuclear transporters, importin (IMP) α/β and the exportin CRM1. Binding was confirmed in cells using pull-downs, while in vitro binding assays showed direct, high affinity (apparent dissociation coefficient of c. 0.25nM) binding of Dp71d to IMPα/β. Interestingly, treatment of cells with the microtubule depolymerizing reagent nocodazole or the dynein inhibitor EHNA both decreased Dp71d nuclear localization, implying that Dp71d nuclear import may be facilitated by microtubules and the motor protein dynein. The role of Dp71d in the nucleus appears to relate in part to interaction with the nuclear envelope protein emerin, and maintenance of the integrity of the nuclear architecture. The clear implication is that Dp71d's previously unrecognised nuclear transport properties likely contribute to various, important physiological roles.

Abstract: Solar thermophotovoltaic (STPV) systems convert solar energy into electricity via thermally radiated photons at tailored wavelengths to increase energy conversion efficiency. In this work, we report the design and analysis of a STPV system with 2D photonic crystals (PhCs) using a high-fidelity thermal-electrical hybrid model that includes the thermal coupling between the absorber/emitter/PV cell and accounts for non-idealities such as temperature gradients and parasitic thermal losses. The desired radiative spectra of the absorber and emitter were achieved by utilizing an optimized two-dimensional periodic square array of cylindrical cavities on a tantalum (Ta) substrate. Various energy loss mechanisms including re-emission at the absorber, low energy emission at the emitter, and a decrease in the emittance due to the angular dependence of PhCs were investigated with varying irradiation flux onto the absorber and resulting operating temperature. The modeling results suggest that the absorber-to-electrical efficiency of a realistic planar STPV consisting of a 2D Ta PhC absorber/emitter and current state of the art InGaAsSb PV cell (whose efficiency is only ~50% of the thermodynamic limit) with a tandem filter can be as high as ~10% at an irradiation flux of ~130kW/m2 and emitter temperature ~1400K. The absorber-to-electrical STPV efficiency can be improved up to ~16% by eliminating optical and electrical non-idealities in the PV cell. The high spectral performance of the optimized 2D Ta PhCs allows a compact system design and operation of STPVs at a significantly lower optical concentration level compared with previous STPVs using macro-scale metallic cavity receivers. This work demonstrates the importance of photon engineering for the development of high efficiency STPVs and offers a framework to improve the performance of both PhC absorbers/emitters and overall STPV systems.

Osteoblast differentiation and survival: A role for A2B adenosine receptor allosteric modulators,

Abstract: The A2B adenosine receptor (A2B AR), activated in response to high levels of endogenous adenosine, is the major AR subtype involved in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation to osteoblasts and bone formation. For this reason, targeting of A2B AR with selective allosteric modulators may represent a promising pharmacological approach to the treatment of bone diseases. Herein, we report the characterization of a 3-keto-indole derivative, 2-(1-benzyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-oxo-N-phenylacetamide (KI-7), as A2B AR positive allosteric modulator in MSCs, demonstrating that this compound is able to potentiate the effects of either adenosine and synthetic orthosteric A2B AR agonists in mediating osteoblast differentiation in vitro. In detail, we observed that MSC treatment with KI-7 determined an increase in the expression of osteoblast-related genes (Runx2 and osterix) and osteoblast marker proteins (phosphatase alkaline and osteocalcin), associated with a stimulation of osteoblast mineralization. In the early phase of differentiation programme, KI-7 significantly potentiated physiological and A2B AR agonist-mediated down-regulation of IL-6 release. Conversely, during the late stage of differentiation, when most of the cells have an osteoblast phenotype, KI-7 caused a sustained raise in IL-6 levels and an improvement in osteoblast viability. These data suggest that a positive allosteric modulation of A2B AR not only favours MSC commitment to osteoblasts, but also ensures a greater survival of mature osteoblasts. Our study paves the way for a therapeutic use of selective positive allosteric modulators of A2B AR in the control of osteoblast differentiation, bone formation and fracture repair.

Abstract: Schlafen 3 (Slfn3) mediates rodent enterocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo, required for intestinal function. Little is known about Schlafen protein structure–function relationships. To define the Slfn3 domain that promotes differentiation, we studied villin and sucrase isomaltase (SI) promoter activity in Slfn3-null human Caco-2BBE cells transfected with full-length rat Slfn3 DNA or truncated constructs. Confocal microscopy and Western blots showed that Slfn3 is predominantly cytosolic. Villin promoter activity, increased by wild type Slfn3, was further enhanced by adding a nuclear exclusion sequence, suggesting that Slfn3 does not affect transcription by direct nuclear action. We therefore sought to dissect the region in Slfn3 stimulating promoter activity. Since examination of the Slfn3 N-terminal region revealed sequences similar to both an aminopeptidase (App) and a divergent P-loop resembling those in NTPases, we initially divided Slfn3 into an N-terminal domain containing the App and P-loop regions, and a C-terminal region. Only the N-terminal construct stimulated promoter activity. Further truncation indicated that both the App and the smaller P-loop constructs enhanced promoter activity similarly to the N-terminal sequence. Point mutations within the N-terminal region (R128L, altering a critical active site residue in the App domain, and L212D, conserved in Schlafens but variable in P-loop proteins) did not affect activity. These results show that Slfn3 acts in the cytosol to trigger a secondary signal cascade that elicits differentiation marker expression and narrows the active domain to the third of the Slfn3 sequence homologous to P-loop NTPases, a first step in understanding its mechanism of action.

Abstract: We report the design and fabrication of an optimized antireflecting structure with the maximum transmittance (Tmax) and minimum reflectivity (Rmin), based on a porous silicon dielectric multilayer (PS-DM). The structures consist of 50 layers of equal thicknesses with an increasing refractive index profile, n(z)~zk. Numerical results based on the transfer matrix method, along with an average spectral analysis, were used to compute a certain range of thicknesses (with the optimal thickness of 235nm) to obtain similar optical response (Tmax and Rmin). The average reflectivity spectrum of a PS-DM structure in the proposed optimal range was experimentally measured to be 1.3% from 300 to 1100nm. Such structures can be used to enhance the efficiency of silicon solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Immunoproteasomes are alternative forms of proteasomes specialized in the generation of MHC class I antigenic peptides and important for efficient cytokine production. We have identified a new biochemical property of 26S immunoproteasomes, namely the ability to hydrolyze basic proteins at greatly increased rates compared to constitutive proteasomes. This enhanced degradative capacity is specific for basic polypeptides, since substrates with a lower content in lysine and arginine residues are hydrolyzed at comparable rates by constitutive and immunoproteasomes. Crucially, selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome tryptic subunit β2i strongly reduces degradation of basic proteins. Therefore, our data demonstrate the rate limiting function of the proteasomal trypsin-like activity in controlling turnover rates of basic protein substrates and suggest new biological roles for immunoproteasomes in maintaining cellular homeostasis by rapidly removing a potentially harmful excess of free histones that can build up under different pathophysiological conditions.

Abstract: Ferritin light chain (FTL) reduces the free iron concentration by forming ferritin complexes with ferritin heavy chain (FTH). Thus, FTL competes with the Fenton reaction by acting as an antioxidant. In the present study, we determined that FTL influences the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response. FTL protein expression was regulated by LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 cells. To investigate the role of FTL in LPS-activated murine macrophages, we established stable FTL-expressing cells and used shRNA to silence FTL expression in RAW264.7 cells. Overexpression of FTL significantly decreased the LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Additionally, overexpression of FTL decreased the LPS-induced increase of the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, FTL overexpression suppressed the LPS-induced activation of MAPKs and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In contrast, knockdown of FTL by shRNA showed the reverse effects. Therefore, our results indicate that FTL plays an anti-inflammatory role in response to LPS in murine macrophages and may have therapeutic potential for treating inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: We developed high throughput, high efficiency 1.43m2 hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) single-junction photovoltaic (PV) modules using a two-step deposition for the intrinsic a-Si:H absorber with the high deposition rate of 0.41nm/s. The developed module using the two-step deposition method leads to higher initial maximum power (Pmax) due to the reduced recombination loss at the p/i interface, compared to the a-Si:H single-junction PV module fabricated by the conventional one-step deposition with the low deposition rate of 0.20nm/s. In addition, the developed module exhibits moderate light-induced degradation ratio of 26.1% in an outdoor exposure test with accumulated solar irradiance >380kWh/m2. Thus, the comparable energy output gain is confirmed via a long-term outdoor field test. Consequently, superior throughput of the developed module over the conventional module is possible with comparable stabilized performance.

Abstract: We recently discovered that the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) B55α subunit (PPP2R2A) is under-expressed in primary blast cells and is unfavorable for remission duration in AML patients. In this study, reverse phase protein analysis (RPPA) of 230 proteins in 511 AML patient samples revealed a strong correlation of B55α with a number of proteins including MYC, PKC α, and SRC. B55α suppression in OCI-AML3 cells by shRNA demonstrated that the B subunit is a PKCα phosphatase. B55α does not target SRC, but rather the kinase suppresses protein expression of the B subunit. Finally, the correlation between B55α and MYC levels reflected a complex stoichiometric competition between B subunits. Loss of B55α in OCI-AML3 cells did not change global PP2A activity and the only isoform that is induced is the one containing B56α. In cells containing B55α shRNA, MYC was suppressed with concomitant induction of the competing B subunit B56α (PPP2R5A). A recent study determined that FTY-720, a drug whose action involves the activation of PP2A, resulted in the induction of B55α In AML cells, and a reduction of the B subunit rendered these cells resistant to FTY-720. Finally, reduction of the B subunit resulted in an increase in the expression of miR-191-5p and a suppression of miR-142-3p. B55α regulation of these miRs was intriguing as high levels of miR-191 portend poor survival in AML, and miR-142-3p is mutated in 2% of AML patient samples. In summary, the suppression of B55α activates signaling pathways that could support leukemia cell survival.

Quantitative evaluation of the cell penetrating properties of an iodinated Tyr-l-maurocalcine analog,

Abstract: L-Maurocalcine (L-MCa) is the first reported animal cell-penetrating toxin. Characterizing its cell penetration properties is crucial considering its potential as a vector for the intracellular delivery of drugs. Radiolabeling is a sensitive and quantitative method to follow the cell accumulation of a molecule of interest. An L-MCa analog containing an additional N-terminal tyrosine residue (Tyr-L-MCa) was synthesized, shown to fold and oxidize properly, and successfully radioiodinated to 125I-Tyr-L-MCa. Using various microscopy techniques, the average volume of the rat line F98 glioma cells was evaluated at 8.9 to 18.9×10−7μl. 125I-Tyr-L-MCa accumulates within cells with a dose-dependency similar to the one previously published using 5,6-carboxyfluorescein-L-MCa. According to subcellular fractionation of F98 cells, plasma membranes keep less than 3% of the peptide, regardless of the extracellular concentration, while the nucleus accumulates over 75% and the cytosol around 20% of the radioactive material. Taking into account both nuclear and cytosolic fractions, cells accumulate intracellular concentrations of the peptide that are equal to the extracellular concentrations. Estimation of 125I-Tyr-L-MCa cell entry kinetics indicate a first rapid phase with a 5min time constant for the plasma membrane followed by slower processes for the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Once inside cells, the labeled material no longer escapes from the intracellular environment since 90% of the radioactivity remains 24h after washout. Dead cells were found to have a lower uptake than live ones. The quantitative information gained herein will be useful for better framing the use of L-MCa in biotechnological applications.

Abstract: Temperature is one of the most specific external parameters that can accelerate the degradation rate in polymer:fullerene solar cells. To detect modifications of the active layer materials, electric noise spectroscopy is a sensitive experimental technique. A detailed characterization of the dc electric transport and voltage–noise properties shows how thermal ageing is detrimental for the investigated bulk heterojunction photovoltaic system. In particular, an increase of the energy barrier height at the interface between the metal contact and the blend, and a simultaneous decrease of the charge carrier zero-field mobility, evaluated through the analysis of the flicker noise component, are observed as a consequence of a thermal treatment. These effects can be related to morphological changes of the solar cell active layer and interface, and are revealed by monitoring the noise level.

Alpha-crystallin-mediated protection of lens cells against heat and oxidative stress-induced cell death,

Abstract: In addition to their key role as structural lens proteins, α-crystallins also appear to confer protection against many eye diseases, including cataract, retinitis pigmentosa, and macular degeneration. Exogenous recombinant α-crystallin proteins were examined for their ability to prevent cell death induced by heat or oxidative stress in a human lens epithelial cell line (HLE-B3). Wild type αA- or αB-crystallin (WT-αA and WT-αB) and αA- or αB-crystallins, modified by the addition of a cell penetration peptide (CPP) designed to enhance the uptake of proteins into cells (gC-αB, TAT-αB, gC-αA), were produced by recombinant methods. In vitro chaperone-like assays were used to assay the ability of α-crystallins to protect client proteins from chemical or heat induced aggregation. In vivo viability assays were performed in HLE-B3 to determine whether pre-treatment with α-crystallins reduced death after exposure to oxidative or heat stress. Most of the five recombinant α-crystallin proteins tested conferred some in vitro protection from protein aggregation, with the greatest effect seen with WT-αB and gC-αB. All α-crystallins displayed significant protection to oxidative stress induced cell death, while only the αB-crystallins reduced cell death induced by thermal stress. Our findings indicate that the addition of the gC tag enhanced the protective effect of αB-crystallin against oxidative but not thermally-induced cell death. In conclusion, modifications that increase the uptake of α-crystallin proteins into cells, without destroying their chaperone-like activity and anti-apoptotic functions, create the potential to use these proteins therapeutically.

Cholesterol-induced activation of TRPM7 regulates cell proliferation, migration, and viability of human prostate cells,

Abstract: Cholesterol has been shown to promote cell proliferation/migration in many cells; however the mechanism(s) have not yet been fully identified. Here we demonstrate that cholesterol increases Ca2+ entry via the TRPM7 channel, which promoted proliferation of prostate cells by inducing the activation of the AKT and/or the ERK pathway. Additionally, cholesterol mediated Ca2+ entry induced calpain activity that showed a decrease in E-cadherin expression, which together could lead to migration of prostate cancer cells. An overexpression of TRPM7 significantly facilitated cholesterol dependent Ca2+ entry, cell proliferation and tumor growth. Whereas, TRPM7 silencing or inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statin showed a significant decrease in cholesterol-mediated activation of TRPM7, cell proliferation, and migration of prostate cancer cells. Consistent with these results, statin intake was inversely correlated with prostate cancer patients and increase in TRPM7 expression was observed in samples obtained from prostate cancer patients. Altogether, we provide evidence that cholesterol-mediated activation of TRPM7 is important for prostate cancer and have identified that TRPM7 could be essential for initiation and/or progression of prostate cancer.
