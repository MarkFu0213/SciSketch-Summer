Abstract: Summary
Influx of eosinophils into the lungs is typically associated with type II responses during allergy and fungal and parasitic infections. However, we previously reported that eosinophils accumulate in lung lesions during type I inflammatory responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in humans, macaques, and mice, in which they support host resistance. Here we show eosinophils migrate into the lungs of macaques and mice as early as one week after Mtb exposure. In mice this influx is CCR3 independent and instead requires cell-intrinsic expression of the oxysterol receptor GPR183, which is highly expressed on human and macaque eosinophils. Murine eosinophils interact directly with bacilli-laden alveolar macrophages, which upregulate the oxysterol-synthesizing enzyme Ch25h, and eosinophil recruitment is impaired in Ch25h-deficient mice. Our findings show that eosinophils are among the earliest cells from circulation to sense and respond to Mtb infection of alveolar macrophages and reveal a role for GPR183 in the migration of eosinophils into lung tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Social behaviors are among the most important motivated behaviors. How dopamine (DA), a “reward” signal, releases during social behaviors has been a topic of interest for decades. Here, we use a genetically encoded DA sensor, GRABDA2m, to record DA activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core during various social behaviors in male and female mice. We find that DA releases during approach, investigation and consummation phases of social behaviors signal animals’ motivation, familiarity of the social target, and valence of the experience, respectively. Positive and negative social experiences evoke opposite DA patterns. Furthermore, DA releases during mating and fighting are sexually dimorphic with a higher level in males than in females. At the functional level, increasing DA in NAc enhances social interest toward a familiar conspecific and alleviates defeat-induced social avoidance. Altogether, our results reveal complex information encoded by NAc DA activity during social behaviors and their multistage functional roles.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the fundamental roles of TGF-β family signaling in cell fate determination in all metazoans, the mechanism by which these signals are spatially and temporally interpreted remains elusive. The cell-context-dependent function of TGF-β signaling largely relies on transcriptional regulation by SMAD proteins. Here, we discover that the DNA repair-related protein, HMCES, contributes to early development by maintaining nodal/activin- or BMP-signaling-regulated transcriptional network. HMCES binds with R-SMAD proteins, co-localizing at active histone marks. However, HMCES chromatin occupancy is independent on nodal/activin or BMP signaling. Mechanistically, HMCES competitively binds chromatin to limit binding by R-SMAD proteins, thereby forcing their dissociation and resulting in repression of their regulatory effects. In Xenopus laevis embryo, hmces KD causes dramatic development defects with abnormal left-right axis asymmetry along with increasing expression of lefty1. These findings reveal HMCES transcriptional regulatory function in the context of TGF-β family signaling.

Abstract: Summary
An essential first step in the post-translational modification of proteins with UFM1, UFMylation, is the proteolytic cleavage of pro-UFM1 to expose a C-terminal glycine. Of the two UFM1-specific proteases (UFSPs) identified in humans, only UFSP2 is reported to be active, since the annotated sequence of UFSP1 lacks critical catalytic residues. Nonetheless, efficient UFM1 maturation occurs in cells lacking UFSP2, suggesting the presence of another active protease. We herein identify UFSP1 translated from a non-canonical start site to be this protease. Cells lacking both UFSPs show complete loss of UFMylation resulting from an absence of mature UFM1. While UFSP2, but not UFSP1, removes UFM1 from the ribosomal subunit RPL26, UFSP1 acts earlier in the pathway to mature UFM1 and cleave a potential autoinhibitory modification on UFC1, thereby controlling activation of UFMylation. In summary, our studies reveal important distinctions in substrate specificity and localization-dependent functions for the two proteases in regulating UFMylation.

Abstract: Summary
Which cell types constitute brain circuits is a fundamental question, but establishing the correspondence across cellular data modalities is challenging. Bio-realistic models allow probing cause-and-effect and linking seemingly disparate modalities. Here, we introduce a computational optimization workflow to generate 9,200 single-neuron models with active conductances. These models are based on 230 in vitro electrophysiological experiments followed by morphological reconstruction from the mouse visual cortex. We show that, in contrast to current belief, the generated models are robust representations of individual experiments and cortical cell types as defined via cellular electrophysiology or transcriptomics. Next, we show that differences in specific conductances predicted from the models reflect differences in gene expression supported by single-cell transcriptomics. The differences in model conductances, in turn, explain electrophysiological differences observed between the cortical subclasses. Our computational effort reconciles single-cell modalities that define cell types and enables causal relationships to be examined.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most common form of RNA modification, controls CD4+ T cell homeostasis by targeting the IL-7/STAT5/SOCS signaling pathways. The role of m6A modification in unconventional T cell development remains unknown. Using mice with T cell-specific deletion of RNA methyltransferase METTL14 (T-Mettl14−/−), we demonstrate that m6A modification is indispensable for iNKT cell homeostasis. Loss of METTL14-dependent m6A modification leads to the upregulation of apoptosis in double-positive thymocytes, which in turn decreases Vα14-Jα18 gene rearrangements, resulting in drastic reduction of iNKT numbers in the thymus and periphery. Residual T-Mettl14−/− iNKT cells exhibit increased apoptosis, impaired maturation, and decreased responsiveness to IL-2/IL-15 and TCR stimulation. Furthermore, METTL14 knockdown in mature iNKT cells diminishes their cytokine production, correlating with increased Cish expression and decreased TCR signaling. Collectively, our study highlights a critical role for METTL14-dependent-m6A modification in iNKT cell development and function.

Abstract: Summary
Lassa virus (LASV) is recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the top five pathogens likely to cause a severe outbreak. A recent unprecedented resurgence of LASV in Nigeria caused by genetically diverse strains underscores the need for licensed medical countermeasures. Single-injection vaccines that can rapidly control outbreaks and confer long-term immunity are needed. Vaccination of cynomolgus monkeys with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing the glycoprotein precursor of LASV lineage IV strain Josiah (rVSVΔG-LASV-GPC) induces fast-acting protection in monkeys challenged 3 or 7 days later with a genetically heterologous lineage II isolate of LASV from Nigeria, while nonspecifically vaccinated control animals succumb to challenge. The rVSVΔG-LASV-GPC vaccine induces rapid activation of adaptive immunity and the transcription of natural killer (NK) cell-affiliated mRNAs. This study demonstrates that rVSVΔG-LASV-GPC may provide rapid protection in humans against LASV infections in cases where immediate public-health intervention is required.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence is an irreversible growth arrest with a dynamic secretome, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescence is a cell-intrinsic barrier for reprogramming, whereas the SASP facilitates cell fate conversion in non-senescent cells. However, the mechanisms by which reprogramming-induced senescence regulates cell plasticity are not well understood. Here, we investigate how the heterogeneity of paracrine senescence impacts reprogramming. We show that senescence promotes in vitro reprogramming in a stress-dependent manner. Unbiased proteomics identifies a catalog of SASP factors involved in the cell fate conversion. Amphiregulin (AREG), frequently secreted by senescent cells, promotes in vitro reprogramming by accelerating proliferation and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition via EGFR signaling. AREG treatment diminishes the negative effect of donor age on reprogramming. Finally, AREG enhances in vivo reprogramming in skeletal muscle. Hence, various SASP factors can facilitate cellular plasticity to promote reprogramming and tissue repair.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of myeloid-lineage cells with limited therapeutic options. We previously combined ex vivo drug sensitivity with genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical annotations for a large cohort of AML patients, which facilitated discovery of functional genomic correlates. Here, we present a dataset that has been harmonized with our initial report to yield a cumulative cohort of 805 patients (942 specimens). We show strong cross-cohort concordance and identify features of drug response. Further, deconvoluting transcriptomic data shows that drug sensitivity is governed broadly by AML cell differentiation state, sometimes conditionally affecting other correlates of response. Finally, modeling of clinical outcome reveals a single gene, PEAR1, to be among the strongest predictors of patient survival, especially for young patients. Collectively, this report expands a large functional genomic resource, offers avenues for mechanistic exploration and drug development, and reveals tools for predicting outcome in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing (AS) is a critical regulatory layer; yet, factors controlling functionally coordinated splicing programs during developmental transitions are poorly understood. Here, we employ a screening strategy to identify factors controlling dynamic splicing events important for mammalian neurogenesis. Among previously unknown regulators, Rbm38 acts widely to negatively control neural AS, in part through interactions mediated by the established repressor of splicing, Ptbp1. Puf60, a ubiquitous factor, is surprisingly found to promote neural splicing patterns. This activity requires a conserved, neural-differential exon that remodels Puf60 co-factor interactions. Ablation of this exon rewires distinct AS networks in embryonic stem cells and at different stages of mouse neurogenesis. Single-cell transcriptome analyses further reveal distinct roles for Rbm38 and Puf60 isoforms in establishing neuronal identity. Our results describe important roles for previously unknown regulators of neurogenesis and establish how an alternative exon in a widely expressed splicing factor orchestrates temporal control over cell differentiation.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive and incurable cancer. Although understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC has greatly advanced, therapeutic options for the disease remain limited. In this study, we demonstrated that SETD5 expression is positively associated with poor prognosis of HCC and that SETD5 depletion decreased HCC cell proliferation and invasion while inducing cell death. Transcriptome analysis revealed that SETD5 loss downregulated the interferon-mediated inflammatory response in HCC cells. In addition, SETD5 depletion downregulated the expression of a critical glycolysis gene, PKM (pyruvate kinase M1/2), and decreased glycolysis activity in HCC cells. Finally, SETD5 knockdown inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. These results collectively suggest that SETD5 is involved in the tumorigenic features of HCC cells and that targeting SETD5 may suppress HCC progression.

Abstract: Summary
Under adverse conditions such as shade or elevated temperatures, cotyledon expansion is reduced and hypocotyl growth is promoted to optimize plant architecture. The mechanisms underlying the repression of cotyledon cell expansion remain unknown. Here, we report that the nuclear abundance of the BES1 transcription factor decreased in the cotyledons and increased in the hypocotyl in Arabidopsis thaliana under shade or warmth. Brassinosteroid levels did not follow the same trend. PIF4 and COP1 increased their nuclear abundance in both organs under shade or warmth. PIF4 directly bound the BES1 promoter to enhance its activity but indirectly reduced BES1 expression. COP1 physically interacted with the BES1 protein, promoting its proteasome degradation in the cotyledons. COP1 had the opposite effect in the hypocotyl, demonstrating organ-specific regulatory networks. Our work indicates that shade or warmth reduces BES1 activity by transcriptional and post-translational regulation to inhibit cotyledon cell expansion.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike N-terminal domain (NTD) remains poorly characterized despite enrichment of mutations in this region across variants of concern (VOCs). Here, we examine the contribution of the NTD to infection and cell-cell fusion by constructing chimeric spikes bearing B.1.617 lineage (Delta and Kappa variants) NTDs and generating spike pseudotyped lentivirus. We find that the Delta NTD on a Kappa or wild-type (WT) background increases S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and virus entry, specifically in lung cells and airway organoids, through use of TMPRSS2. Delta exhibits increased cell-cell fusogenicity that could be conferred to WT and Kappa spikes by Delta NTD transfer. However, chimeras of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 spikes with a Delta NTD do not show more efficient TMPRSS2 use or fusogenicity. We conclude that the NTD allosterically modulates S1/S2 cleavage and spike-mediated functions in a spike context-dependent manner, and allosteric interactions may be lost when combining regions from more distantly related VOCs.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the seventh-leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and is associated with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. The extracellular matrix (ECM) represents the main component of the tumor microenvironment. Studies have found controversial roles of osteoglycin (OGN), a classical small leucine-rich proteoglycan found in the ECM in human malignancies; however, the significance of OGN in PC has not been determined. Here, the expression profiles of OGN in PC tissues and cell lines were evaluated by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and quantitative PCR. OGN was found to be significantly upregulated in PC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, the expression of OGN was observed to be closely associated with TNM stage, stage III showed a higher OGN expression than that of stages I and II. Survival analysis showed that patients with PC showing high levels of OGN had low survival rates. The effects of OGN on cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed using MTT, CCK8, EdU and TUNEL assays. Wound-healing and invasion assays were conducted to test migratory and invasive abilities. Overexpression of OGN was demonstrated to promote proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibit apoptosis of PC cells. Further experiments revealed that inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) was upregulated by OGN. Silencing ID4 by small interfering RNA was shown to partially reverse the tumor-promoting effect of OGN. Collectively, our preliminary results indicate that the elevated expression of OGN may be associated with PC progression and may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of PC. Targeting of OGN/ID4 axis may be a promising strategy in PC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The mTOR-dependent nutrient-sensing and response machinery is the central hub for animals to regulate their cellular and developmental programs. However, equivalently pivotal nutrient and metabolite signals upstream of mTOR and developmental-regulatory signals downstream of mTOR are not clear, especially at the organism level. We previously showed glucosylceramide (GlcCer) acts as a critical nutrient and metabolite signal for overall amino acid levels to promote development by activating the intestinal mTORC1 signaling pathway. Here, through a large-scale genetic screen, we find that the intestinal peroxisome is critical for antagonizing the GlcCer-mTORC1-mediated nutrient signal. Mechanistically, GlcCer deficiency, inactive mTORC1, or prolonged starvation relocates intestinal peroxisomes closer to the apical region in a kinesin- and microtubule-dependent manner. Those apical accumulated peroxisomes further release peroxisomal-β-oxidation-derived glycolipid hormones that target chemosensory neurons and downstream nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12 to arrest the animal development. Our data illustrate a sophisticated gut-brain axis that predominantly orchestrates nutrient-sensing-dependent development in animals.

Abstract: Summary
Restoring sensation after injury or disease requires a reproducible method for generating large quantities of bona fide somatosensory interneurons. Toward this goal, we assess the mechanisms by which dorsal spinal interneurons (dIs; dI1–dI6) can be derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Using two developmentally relevant growth factors, retinoic acid (RA) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, we recapitulate the complete in vivo program of dI differentiation through a neuromesodermal intermediate. Transcriptional profiling reveals that mESC-derived dIs strikingly resemble endogenous dIs, with the correct molecular and functional signatures. We further demonstrate that RA specifies dI4–dI6 fates through a default multipotential state, while the addition of BMP4 induces dI1–dI3 fates and activates Wnt signaling to enhance progenitor proliferation. Constitutively activating Wnt signaling permits the dramatic expansion of neural progenitor cultures. These cultures retain the capacity to differentiate into diverse populations of dIs, thereby providing a method of increasing neuronal yield.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical modifications of mRNA, the so-called epitranscriptome, represent an additional layer of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The most common epitranscriptomic modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is generated by a multi-subunit methyltransferase complex. We show that alphaherpesvirus kinases trigger phosphorylation of several components of the m6A methyltransferase complex, including METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP, which correlates with inhibition of the complex and a near complete loss of m6A levels in mRNA of virus-infected cells. Expression of the viral US3 protein is necessary and sufficient for phosphorylation and inhibition of the m6A methyltransferase complex. Although m6A methyltransferase complex inactivation is not essential for virus replication in cell culture, the consensus m6A methylation motif is under-represented in alphaherpesvirus genomes, suggesting evolutionary pressure against methylation of viral transcripts. Together, these findings reveal that phosphorylation can be associated with inactivation of the m6A methyltransferase complex, in this case mediated by the viral US3 protein.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome alignment at the spindle equator promotes proper chromosome segregation and depends on pulling forces exerted at kinetochore fiber tips together with polar ejection forces. However, kinetochore fibers are also subjected to forces driving their poleward flux. Here we introduce a flux-driven centering model that relies on flux generated by forces within the overlaps of bridging and kinetochore fibers. This centering mechanism works so that the longer kinetochore fiber fluxes faster than the shorter one, moving the kinetochores toward the center. We develop speckle microscopy in human spindles and confirm the key prediction that kinetochore fiber flux is length dependent. Kinetochores are better centered when overlaps are shorter and the kinetochore fiber flux slower than the bridging fiber flux. We identify Kif18A and Kif4A as overlap and flux regulators and NuMA as a fiber coupler. Thus, length-dependent sliding forces exerted by the bridging fiber onto kinetochore fibers support chromosome alignment.

Abstract: Summary
Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a disease associated with a mitochondrial DNA mutation, is characterized by blindness due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, which form the optic nerve. We show that a sustained pathological autophagy and compartment-specific mitophagy activity affects LHON patient-derived cells and cybrids, as well as induced pluripotent-stem-cell-derived neurons. This is variably counterbalanced by compensatory mitobiogenesis. The aberrant quality control disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis as reflected by defective bioenergetics and excessive reactive oxygen species production, a stress phenotype that ultimately challenges cell viability by increasing the rate of apoptosis. We counteract this pathological mechanism by using autophagy regulators (clozapine and chloroquine) and redox modulators (idebenone), as well as genetically activating mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1-α overexpression). This study substantially advances our understanding of LHON pathophysiology, providing an integrated paradigm for pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and druggable targets for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Hair follicle stem cells are regulated by dermal papilla fibroblasts, their principal signaling niche. Overactivation of Hedgehog signaling in the niche dramatically accelerates hair growth and induces follicle multiplication in mice. On single-cell RNA sequencing, dermal papilla fibroblasts increase heterogeneity to include new Wnt5ahigh states. Transcriptionally, mutant fibroblasts activate regulatory networks for Gli1, Alx3, Ebf1, Hoxc8, Sox18, and Zfp239. These networks jointly upregulate secreted factors for multiple hair morphogenesis and hair-growth-related pathways. Among these is non-conventional TGF-β ligand Scube3. We show that in normal mouse skin, Scube3 is expressed only in dermal papillae of growing, but not in resting follicles. SCUBE3 protein microinjection is sufficient to induce new hair growth, and pharmacological TGF-β inhibition rescues mutant hair hyper-activation phenotype. Moreover, dermal-papilla-enriched expression of SCUBE3 and its growth-activating effect are partially conserved in human scalp hair follicles. Thus, Hedgehog regulates mesenchymal niche function in the hair follicle via SCUBE3/TGF-β mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue engineering offers a promising treatment strategy for ureteral strictures, but its success requires an in-depth understanding of the architecture, cellular heterogeneity, and signaling pathways underlying tissue regeneration. Here, we define and spatially map cell populations within the human ureter using single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial gene expression, and immunofluorescence approaches. We focus on the stromal and urothelial cell populations to enumerate the distinct cell types composing the human ureter and infer potential cell-cell communication networks underpinning the bi-directional crosstalk between these compartments. Furthermore, we analyze and experimentally validate the importance of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway in adult progenitor cell maintenance. The SHH-expressing basal cells support organoid generation in vitro and accurately predict the differentiation trajectory from basal progenitor cells to terminally differentiated umbrella cells. Our results highlight the essential processes involved in adult ureter tissue homeostasis and provide a blueprint for guiding ureter tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidative stress conditions can cause ATP depletion, oxidative protein unfolding, and potentially toxic protein aggregation. To alleviate this proteotoxic stress, the highly conserved yeast protein, Get3, switches from its guiding function as an ATP-dependent targeting factor for tail-anchored proteins to its guarding function as an ATP-independent molecular chaperone that prevents irreversible protein aggregation. Here, we demonstrate that activation of Get3’s chaperone function follows a tightly orchestrated multi-step process, centered around the redox status of two conserved cysteines, whose reactivity is directly controlled by Get3’s nucleotide-binding state. Thiol oxidation causes local unfolding and the transition into chaperone-active oligomers. Vice versa, inactivation requires the reduction of Get3’s cysteines followed by ATP-binding, which allows the transfer of bound client proteins to ATP-dependent chaperone systems for their effective refolding. Manipulating this fine-tuned cycle of activation and inactivation in yeast impairs oxidative stress resistance and growth, illustrating the necessity to tightly control Get3’s intrinsic chaperone function.

Abstract: Objectives
To observe the changes in the bladder of fetal rats with myelomeningocele (MMC) induced by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) during the embryonic development stages.
Methods
The fetal rat model of MMC was induced by intragastric administration of atRA to pregnant rats on embryonic day 10 (E10). Fetal rats were harvested at E16, E18, E20, and E21 for observation and further testing. Those with MMC were classified as the MMC group, while those without MMC as the RA group. The areas of MMC skin defect, the crown-rump length (CRL), and body weight in different groups were compared. The histopathological changes in the bladder were compared. The expression levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), connexin 43 (Cx43), desmin, β3 tubulin, and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the bladder were investigated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Pregnant rats given intragastric administration with olive oil (OIL group) at E10 were set as the blank control group.
Results
A total of 415 fetal rats of different gestational ages were harvested with an MMC incidence of 56.05 % (139/248). The incidence rate increased with embryonic days (p < 0.001). Compared with the other two control groups, the CRL and bodyweight of MMC fetal rats were significantly delayed at E21 (p < 0.001). The expression levels of αSMA, SMMHC, Cx43, desmin, β3 tubulin and VAChT in the bladder of MMC fetal rats were significantly decreased at E21 (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
In atRA-induced MMC fetal rats, there is neural, muscular, and stromal dysplasia in the bladder at an early gestational age. Further investigations on neurogenic bladder secondary to MMC are applicable using this animal model.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) exhibit a unique feature that requires S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for the maintenance of their pluripotency. Methionine deprivation in the medium causes a reduction in intracellular SAM, thus rendering PSCs in a state potentiated for differentiation. In this study, we find that methionine deprivation triggers a reduction in intracellular protein-bound Zn content and upregulation of Zn exporter SLC30A1 in PSCs. Culturing PSCs in Zn-deprived medium results in decreased intracellular protein-bound Zn content, reduced cell growth, and potentiated differentiation, which partially mimics methionine deprivation. PSCs cultured under Zn deprivation exhibit an altered methionine metabolism-related metabolite profile. We conclude that methionine deprivation potentiates differentiation partly by lowering cellular Zn content. We establish a protocol to generate functional pancreatic β cells by applying methionine and Zn deprivation. Our results reveal a link between Zn signaling and methionine metabolism in the regulation of cell fate in PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Within the hair follicle (HF) niche, dermal papilla (DP) cells are well known for the hair induction capacity; however, DP cell signaling also regulates HF pigmentation. Here we describe how Sox2 in the DP is a key regulator of melanocyte signaling. To study the largely unknown regulatory role the DP has on hair pigmentation, we characterize leptin receptor (Lepr) expression in the skin and as a genetic tool to target the DP. Sox2 ablation in the DP results in a phenotypic switch from eumelanin to pheomelanin. Mechanistically, we describe a temporal upregulation of Agouti and downregulation of Corin, directly by Sox2 in the DP. We also show that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling regulation by Sox2 is responsible for downregulating MC1R, Dct, and Tyr in melanocytes of Sox2 cKO mice. Thus, we demonstrate that Sox2 in the DP regulates not only the choice of hair pigment but also the overall HF pigment production.

Abstract: Segments are repeated anatomical units forming the body of insects. In Drosophila, the specification of the body takes place during the blastoderm through the segmentation cascade. Pair-rule genes such as hairy (h), even-skipped (eve), runt (run), and fushi-tarazu (ftz) are of the intermediate level of the cascade and each pair-rule gene is expressed in seven transversal stripes along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo. Stripes are formed by independent cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) under the regulation of transcription factors of maternal source and of gap proteins of the first level of the cascade. The initial blastoderm of Drosophila is a syncytium and it also coincides with the mid-blastula transition when thousands of zygotic genes are transcribed and their products are able to diffuse in the cytoplasm. Thus, we anticipated a complex regulation of the CRMs of the pair-rule stripes. The CRMs of h 1, eve 1, run 1, ftz 1 are able to be activated by bicoid (bcd) throughout the anterior blastoderm and several lines of evidence indicate that they are repressed by the anterior gap genes slp1 (sloppy-paired 1), tll (tailless) and hkb (huckebein). The modest activity of these repressors led to the premise of a combinatorial mechanism regulating the expression of the CRMs of h 1, eve 1, run 1, ftz 1 in more anterior regions of the embryo. We tested this possibility by progressively removing the repression activities of slp1, tll and hkb. In doing so, we were able to expose a mechanism of additive repression limiting the anterior borders of stripes 1. Stripes 1 respond depending on their distance from the anterior end and repressors operating at different levels.

Abstract: Epithin/PRSS14 is a membrane serine protease that plays a key role in tumor progression. The protease exists on the cell surface until its ectodomain shedding, which releases most of the extracellular domain. Previously, we showed that the remaining portion on the membrane undergoes intramembrane proteolysis, which results in the liberation of the intracellular domain and the intracellular domain-mediated gene expression. In this study, we investigated how the intramembrane proteolysis for the nuclear function is initiated. We observed that ectodomain shedding of epithin/PRSS14 in mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells increased depending on environmental conditions and was positively correlated with invasiveness of the cells and their pro-invasive cytokine production. We identified selenite as an environmental factor that can induce ectodomain shedding of the protease and increase C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secretion in an epithin/PRSS14-dependent manner. Additionally, by demonstrating that the expression of the intracellular domain of epithin/PRSS14 is sufficient to induce CCL2 secretion, we established that epithin/PRSS14-dependent shedding and its subsequent intramembrane proteolysis are responsible for the metastatic conversion of 4T1 cells under these conditions. Consequently, we propose that epithin/PRSS14 can act as an environment-sensing receptor that promotes cancer metastasis by liberating the intracellular domain bearing transcriptional activity under conditions promoting ectodomain shedding.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the prevalence of Down syndrome (DS), little is known regarding the specific cell pathologies that underlie this multi-system disorder. To understand which cell types and pathways are more directly affected by trisomy 21 (T21), we used an inducible-XIST system to silence one chromosome 21 in vitro. T21 caused the dysregulation of Notch signaling in iPSCs, potentially affecting cell-type programming. Further analyses identified dysregulation of pathways important for two cell types: neurogenesis and angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is essential to many bodily systems, yet is understudied in DS; therefore, we focused next on whether T21 affects endothelial cells. An in vitro assay for microvasculature formation revealed a cellular pathology involving delayed tube formation in response to angiogenic signals. Parallel transcriptomic analysis of endothelia further showed deficits in angiogenesis regulators. Results indicate a direct cell-autonomous impact of T21 on endothelial function, highlighting the importance of angiogenesis, with wide-reaching implications for development and disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular heterogeneity is a hallmark of multicellular organisms. During shoot regeneration from undifferentiated callus, only a select few cells, called progenitors, develop into shoot. How these cells are selected and what governs their subsequent progression to a patterned organ system is unknown. Using Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that it is not just the abundance of stem cell regulators but rather the localization pattern of polarity proteins that predicts the progenitor’s fate. A shoot-promoting factor, CUC2, activated the expression of the cell-wall-loosening enzyme, XTH9, solely in a shell of cells surrounding the progenitor, causing different mechanical stresses in these cells. This mechanical conflict then activates cell polarity in progenitors to promote meristem formation. Interestingly, genetic or physical perturbations to cells surrounding the progenitor impaired the progenitor and vice versa. These suggest a feedback loop between progenitors and their neighbors for shoot regeneration in the absence of tissue-patterning cues.

Abstract: Summary
The integrated stress response (ISR) plays a pivotal role in adaptation of translation machinery to cellular stress. Here, we demonstrate an ISR-independent osmoadaptation mechanism involving reprogramming of translation via coordinated but independent actions of mTOR and plasma membrane amino acid transporter SNAT2. This biphasic response entails reduced global protein synthesis and mTOR signaling followed by translation of SNAT2. Induction of SNAT2 leads to accumulation of amino acids and reactivation of mTOR and global protein synthesis, paralleled by partial reversal of the early-phase, stress-induced translatome. We propose SNAT2 functions as a molecular switch between inhibition of protein synthesis and establishment of an osmoadaptive translation program involving the formation of cytoplasmic condensates of SNAT2-regulated RNA-binding proteins DDX3X and FUS. In summary, we define key roles of SNAT2 in osmotolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons (PNs) coordinates cortical network activity during sensory processing, and this role is mainly attributed to parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (BCs). However, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1)-expressing interneurons are also BCs, but the connectivity and function of these elusive but prominent neocortical inhibitory neurons are unclear. We find that their connectivity pattern is visual area specific. Persistently active CB1 signaling suppresses GABA release from CB1 BCs in the medial secondary visual cortex (V2M), but not in the primary visual cortex (V1). Accordingly, in vivo, tonic CB1 signaling is responsible for higher but less coordinated PN activity in the V2M than in the V1. These differential firing dynamics in the V1 and V2M can be captured by a computational network model that incorporates visual-area-specific properties. Our results indicate a differential CB1-mediated mechanism controlling PN activity, suggesting an alternative connectivity scheme of a specific GABAergic circuit in different cortical areas.

Abstract: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is considered a fatal complication of cyclophosphamide (CP). Down-regulation of Nrf2 and induction of pro-inflammatory mediators are the main pathological factors. Recently, ameliorative potential of the angiotensin II (AII) type-1 (AT1) receptor blocker olmesartan (OLM) on oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines was reported. The current study aims to investigate the possible protective effect of OLM on CP-induced HC in Wistar rats. The animals were divided into the control group (0.5% W/V carboxymethylcellulose, p.o.); OLM group (20 mg/kg, p.o., for 21 days); CP group (a single dose of 100 mg/kg, i.p.); and the remaining groups that received CP i.p. with oral OLM 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg for 21 days, respectively. The bladder tissue was collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, Western blot, and oxidative stress assay. The OLM at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg attenuated increase in TNF-α, IL-6, NF-kB, iNOS, and COX-2 induced by CP. Additionally, it up-regulated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, bladder GSH content, and CAT and SOD activities. The data indicated that OLM inhibited ROS-induced NF-kB, which caused inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Hence, OLM holds great promise for preventing CP-induced HC.

Abstract: Summary
Synapse formation is locally determined by transmembrane proteins, yet synaptic material is synthesized remotely and undergoes processive transport in axons. How local synaptogenic signals intercept synaptic cargo in transport to promote its delivery and synapse formation is unknown. We found that the control of synaptic cargo delivery at microtubule (MT) minus ends mediates pro- and anti-synaptogenic activities of presynaptic neurexin and frizzled in C. elegans and identified the atypical kinesin VAB-8/KIF26 as a key molecule in this process. VAB-8/KIF26 levels at synaptic MT minus ends are controlled by frizzled and neurexin; loss of VAB-8 mimics neurexin mutants or frizzled hyperactivation, and its overexpression can rescue synapse loss in these backgrounds. VAB-8/KIF26 is required for the synaptic localization of other minus-end proteins and promotes the pausing of retrograde transport to allow delivery to synapses. Consistently, reducing retrograde transport rescues synapse loss in vab-8 and neurexin mutants. These results uncover a mechanistic link between synaptogenic signaling and axonal transport.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent chronic joint disease that involves extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and articular cartilage inflammation. Polydatin (PD) can alleviate inflammatory reactions in numerous diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of PD on interleukin (IL)− 1β-treated chondrocytes in vitro and anterior cruciate ligament transection-induced rat OA models in vivo. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from SD rats and cultured. Only second-passage cells were used for subsequent experiments. Counting kit-8, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence were used to detect relevant indices. Rat OA models were established to obtain in vivo data. PD treatment decreased the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-6 during IL-1β-stimulated chondrocyte inflammation. Moreover, PD upregulated aggrecan and collagen II expression, whereas downregulated a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) expression on IL-1β-mediated chondrocytes. Additionally, PD reduced IL-1β-stimulated NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin activation and nuclear translocation. The results of histological analysis and scoring revealed that OA in the rat models was effectively ameliorated by the intra-articular injection of PD. PD suppressed IL-1β-stimulated iNOS, COX-2, NO, and PGE2 production, TNF-α, IL-6, collagen X, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 expression, collagen II and aggrecan degeneration by inhibiting NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro. PD also mitigated OA progression in the rat models, thereby providing reliable data that PD could serve as a promising candidate for OA therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular deconvolution algorithms virtually reconstruct tissue composition by analyzing the gene expression of complex tissues. We present the decision tree machine learning algorithm, Kassandra, trained on a broad collection of >9,400 tissue and blood sorted cell RNA profiles incorporated into millions of artificial transcriptomes to accurately reconstruct the tumor microenvironment (TME). Bioinformatics correction for technical and biological variability, aberrant cancer cell expression inclusion, and accurate quantification and normalization of transcript expression increased Kassandra stability and robustness. Performance was validated on 4,000 H&E slides and 1,000 tissues by comparison with cytometric, immunohistochemical, or single-cell RNA-seq measurements. Kassandra accurately deconvolved TME elements, showing the role of these populations in tumor pathogenesis and other biological processes. Digital TME reconstruction revealed that the presence of PD-1-positive CD8+ T cells strongly correlated with immunotherapy response and increased the predictive potential of established biomarkers, indicating that Kassandra could potentially be utilized in future clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal myogenesis is dynamic, and it involves cell-shape changes together with cell fusion and rearrangements. However, the final muscle arrangement is highly organized with striated fibers. By combining live imaging with quantitative analyses, we dissected fast-twitch myocyte fusion within the zebrafish myotome in toto. We found a strong mediolateral bias in fusion timing; however, at a cellular scale, there was heterogeneity in cell shape and the relationship between initial position of fast myocytes and resulting fusion partners. We show that the expression of the fusogen myomaker is permissive, but not instructive, in determining the spatiotemporal fusion pattern. Rather, we observed a close coordination between slow muscle rearrangements and fast myocyte fusion. In mutants that lack slow fibers, the spatiotemporal fusion pattern is substantially noisier. We propose a model in which slow muscles guide fast myocytes by funneling them close together, enhancing fusion probability. Thus, despite fusion being highly stochastic, a robust myotome structure emerges at the tissue scale.

Abstract: Amongst the superfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are specialized members that mediate Ca2+-selective transport across epithelial membranes. Intriguingly, fluorescent fusion proteins of TRPV5 or TRPV6 are hardly discernible within the plasma membrane of living cells. Instead, TRPV6 is mostly found in vesicular membrane compartments, indicating either a rapid degradation or cycling of channel-bearing vesicles between endomembrane compartments and the plasma membrane. In TRPV6-expressing cells, brefeldin A, a toxin that blocks the transit between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, caused a drop in [Ca2+]i with a half time in the range of 0.5–1 h. Upon wash-out of the toxin, the [Ca2+]i rose to a steady-state level within 2–3 h. Consistently, the synchronized forward trafficking of TRPV6VL-eGFP after brefeldin A wash-out led to a visible accumulation of the protein within the plasma membrane, as shown by confocal and total internal reflection microscopy. Analysis of the internalization route and differentiation of vesicle populations provided evidence for a clathrin-dependent internalization pathway. Most TRPV6VL-bearing vesicles co-stained with Rab5a, a marker protein for early endosomes. Fewer vesicles were co-localized with Rab7a (late endosomes) or with Rab11 (recycling endosomes). From these data, we propose that the lack of plasma membrane visibility of the channel results from a rapid internalization, which in addition to transcriptional regulation, adds a layer of functional channel regulation to modulate transepithelial Ca2+ transport.

Abstract: Myoblast differentiation and fusion are vital for muscle development and repair in mammals. We previously showed that necrostatin-1(Nec-1) protects C2C12 myotubes from cobalt chloride (CoCl2)-induced pseudo-hypoxia. However, the function of Nec-1 in mouse C2C12 myoblast differentiation and fusion was still unknown. In this study, we found that CoCl2 substantially impaired C2C12 myoblast differentiation and fusion, and reduced the expression of Myh1, Myh2, Myh4, Myh7, myomaker, and myomerger. Nec-1 treatment rescued C2C12 myoblast differentiation and fusion and promoted the expression of myomaker and myomerger. Mechanistically, Nec-1 promoted C2C12 myoblast differentiation and fusion by inhibiting mTOR-mediated autophagy. Rapamycin abolished the increases in expression of muscle fusion-related genes, indicating that the upregulation of differentiation and fusion is mTOR-dependent. These results suggest that Nec-1 inhibited autophagy in an mTOR-dependent mechanism that is crucial for mTOR-induced C2C12 myoblast differentiation and fusion.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typically fatal malignancy exhibiting genetic heterogeneity and limited therapy responses. We demonstrate here that HCCs consistently repress urea cycle gene expression and thereby become auxotrophic for exogenous arginine. Surprisingly, arginine import is uniquely dependent on the cationic amino acid transporter SLC7A1, whose inhibition slows HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, arginine deprivation engages an integrated stress response that promotes HCC cell-cycle arrest and quiescence, dependent on the general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase. Inhibiting GCN2 in arginine-deprived HCC cells promotes a senescent phenotype instead, rendering these cells vulnerable to senolytic compounds. Preclinical models confirm that combined dietary arginine deprivation, GCN2 inhibition, and senotherapy promote HCC cell apoptosis and tumor regression. These data suggest novel strategies to treat human liver cancers through targeting SLC7A1 and/or a combination of arginine restriction, inhibition of GCN2, and senolytic agents.

Abstract: The bifunctional cation channel/kinase TrpM7 is ubiquitously expressed and regulates embryonic development and pathogenesis of several common diseases. The TrpM7 integral membrane ion channel domain regulates transmembrane movement of divalent cations, and its kinase domain controls gene expression via histone phosphorylation. Mechanisms regulating TrpM7 are elusive. It exists in two populations in the cell: at the cell surface where it controls divalent cation fluxes, and in intracellular vesicles where it controls zinc uptake and release. Here we report that TrpM7 is palmitoylated at a cluster of cysteines at the C terminal end of its Trp domain. Palmitoylation controls the exit of TrpM7 from the endoplasmic reticulum and the distribution of TrpM7 between cell surface and intracellular pools. Using the Retention Using Selective Hooks (RUSH) system, we demonstrate that palmitoylated TrpM7 traffics from the Golgi to the surface membrane whereas non-palmitoylated TrpM7 is sequestered in intracellular vesicles. We identify the Golgi-resident enzyme zDHHC17 and surface membrane-resident enzyme zDHHC5 as responsible for palmitoylating TrpM7 and find that TrpM7-mediated transmembrane calcium uptake is significantly reduced when TrpM7 is not palmitoylated. The closely related channel/kinase TrpM6 is also palmitoylated on the C terminal side of its Trp domain. Our findings demonstrate that palmitoylation controls ion channel activity of TrpM7 and that TrpM7 trafficking is dependant on its palmitoylation. We define a new mechanism for post translational modification and regulation of TrpM7 and other Trps.

Abstract: Summary
NAD+ kinases (NADKs) are metabolite kinases that phosphorylate NAD+ molecules to make NADP+, a limiting substrate for the generation of reducing power NADPH. NADK2 sustains mitochondrial NADPH production that enables proline biosynthesis and antioxidant defense. However, its molecular architecture and mechanistic regulation remain undescribed. Here, we report the crystal structure of human NADK2, revealing a substrate-driven mode of activation. We find that NADK2 presents an unexpected dimeric organization instead of the typical tetrameric assemblage observed for other NADKs. A specific extended segment (aa 325–365) is crucial for NADK2 dimerization and activity. Moreover, we characterize numerous acetylation events, including those on Lys76 and Lys304, which reside near the active site and inhibit NADK2 activity without disrupting dimerization, thereby reducing mitochondrial NADP(H) production, proline synthesis, and cell growth. These findings reveal important molecular insight into the structure and regulation of a vital enzyme in mitochondrial NADPH and proline metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene activation during tumorigenesis promotes DNA replication stress (RS), which subsequently drives the formation of cancer-associated chromosomal rearrangements. Many episodes of physiological RS likely arise due to conflicts between the DNA replication and transcription machineries operating simultaneously at the same loci. One role of the RAD51 recombinase in human cells is to protect replication forks undergoing RS. Here, we have identified a key role for RAD51 in preventing transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) from triggering replication fork breakage. The genomic regions most affected by RAD51 deficiency are characterized by being replicated and transcribed in early S-phase and show significant overlap with loci prone to cancer-associated amplification. Consistent with a role for RAD51 in protecting against transcription-replication conflicts, many of the adverse effects of RAD51 depletion are ameliorated by inhibiting early S-phase transcription. We propose a model whereby RAD51 suppresses fork breakage and subsequent inadvertent amplification of genomic loci prone to experiencing TRCs.

Abstract: Summary
Pathobionts employ unique metabolic adaptation mechanisms to maximize their growth in disease conditions. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a pathobiont enriched in the gut mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), utilizes diet-derived L-serine to adapt to the inflamed gut. Therefore, the restriction of dietary L-serine starves AIEC and limits its fitness advantage. Here, we find that AIEC can overcome this nutrient limitation by switching the nutrient source from the diet to the host cells in the presence of mucolytic bacteria. During diet-derived L-serine restriction, the mucolytic symbiont Akkermansia muciniphila promotes the encroachment of AIEC to the epithelial niche by degrading the mucus layer. In the epithelial niche, AIEC acquires L-serine from the colonic epithelium and thus proliferates. Our work suggests that the indirect metabolic network between pathobionts and commensal symbionts enables pathobionts to overcome nutritional restriction and thrive in the gut.

Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal lung disease characterized by progressive fibroblast proliferation and extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Although great efforts have been placed to understand the pathogenesis and explore therapeutic strategies, the treatment options for pulmonary fibrosis are very limited and the prognosis of pulmonary fibrosis patients remains poor. Sinensetin is a polymethoxylated flavone derived from citrus fruits, and has been characterized with anti-fibrotic property. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In present study, combining in vitro and in vivo models, we revealed for the first time that sinensetin can protect against pulmonary fibrosis via inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-mediated Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. According to our results, the activation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway in pulmonary fibrosis is responsible for fibroblast proliferation and differentiation to form ECM-producing myofibroblasts. Sinensetin treatment dephosphorylates and activates GSK-3β, a component of β-Catenin destruction complex, which induces β-Catenin degradation and deactivates Wnt/β-Catenin-mediated fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. As a result, myofibroblasts formation and ECM production are reduced and the progression of pulmonary fibrosis is suppressed. These results not only advance our knowledge on the pharmacological activities of sinensetin, but also provide novel insights on pulmonary fibrosis treatment.

Abstract: Summary
A functional electron transport chain (ETC) is crucial for supporting bioenergetics and biosynthesis. Accordingly, ETC inhibition decreases proliferation in cancer cells but does not seem to impair stem cell proliferation. However, it remains unclear how stem cells metabolically adapt. In this study, we show that pharmacological inhibition of complex III of the ETC in skeletal stem and progenitor cells induces glycolysis side pathways and reroutes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to regenerate NAD+ and preserve cell proliferation. These metabolic changes also culminate in increased succinate and 2-hydroxyglutarate levels that inhibit Ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA demethylase activity, thereby preserving self-renewal and multilineage potential. Mechanistically, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase and reverse succinate dehydrogenase activity proved to be essential for the metabolic rewiring in response to ETC inhibition. Together, these data show that the metabolic plasticity of skeletal stem and progenitor cells allows them to bypass ETC blockade and preserve their self-renewal.

Abstract: The accumulation of unfolded proteins within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) activates a signal transduction pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to restore ER homoeostasis. If this cannot be done, UPR signalling ultimately induces apoptosis. Ca2+ depletion in the ER is a potent inducer of ER stress. Despite the ubiquity of Ca2+ as an intracellular messenger, the precise mechanism(s) by which Ca2+ release affects the UPR remains unknown. Tethering a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCamP6) to the ER membrane revealed novel Ca2+ signalling events initiated by Ca2+ microdomains in human astrocytes under ER stress, induced by tunicamycin (Tm), an N-glycosylation inhibitor, as well as in a cell model deficient in all three inositol triphosphate receptor isoforms. Pharmacological and molecular studies indicate that these local events are mediated by translocons and that the Ca2+ microdomains impact (PKR)-like-ER kinase (PERK), an UPR sensor, activation. These findings reveal the existence of a Ca2+ signal mechanism by which stressor-mediated Ca2+ release regulates ER stress.

Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is closely associated with dysregulation of genetic factors and microbial environment. Here, we report a susceptible role of ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) in experimental colitis and bacterial infections. USP2 is upregulated in the inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and in the colon of mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS). Knockout or pharmacologic inhibition of USP2 promotes the proliferation of myeloid cells to activate IL-22 and IFNγ production of T cells. In addition, knockout of USP2 in myeloid cells inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines to relieve the dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) network and promote the gut epithelial integrity after DSS treatment. Consistently, Lyz2-Cre;Usp2fl/fl mice exhibit hyper-resistance to DSS-induced colitis and Citrobacter rodentium infections compared to Usp2fl/fl mice. These findings highlight an indispensable role of USP2 in myeloid cells to modulate T cell activation and epithelial ECM network and repair, indicating USP2 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention of IBD and bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal system.

Abstract: Summary
The importance of defining cell-type-specific genes is well acknowledged. Technological advances facilitate high-resolution sequencing of single cells, but practical challenges remain. Adipose tissue is composed primarily of adipocytes, large buoyant cells requiring extensive, artefact-generating processing for separation and analysis. Thus, adipocyte data are frequently absent from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, despite being the primary functional cell type. Here, we decipher cell-type-enriched transcriptomes from unfractionated human adipose tissue RNA-seq data. We profile all major constituent cell types, using 527 visceral adipose tissue (VAT) or 646 subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples, identifying over 2,300 cell-type-enriched transcripts. Sex-subset analysis uncovers a panel of male-only cell-type-enriched genes. By resolving expression profiles of genes differentially expressed between SAT and VAT, we identify mesothelial cells as the primary driver of this variation.

Abstract: Summary
Growth factors in tumor environments are regulators of cell survival and metastasis. Here, we reveal the dichotomy between TGF-β superfamily growth factors BMP and TGF-β/activin and their downstream SMAD effectors. Gene expression profiling uncovers SOX2 as a key contextual signaling node regulated in an opposing manner by BMP2, -4, and -9 and TGF-β and activin A to impact anchorage-independent cell survival. We find that SOX2 is repressed by BMPs, leading to a reduction in intraperitoneal tumor burden and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice. Repression of SOX2 is driven by SMAD1-dependent histone H3K27me3 recruitment and DNA methylation at SOX2’s promoter. Conversely, TGF-β, which is elevated in patient ascites, and activin A can promote SOX2 expression and anchorage-independent survival by SMAD3-dependent histone H3K4me3 recruitment. Our findings identify SOX2 as a contextual and contrastingly regulated node downstream of TGF-β members controlling anchorage-independent survival and metastasis in ovarian cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike is the target for neutralizing antibodies elicited following both infection and vaccination. While extensive research has shown that the receptor binding domain (RBD) and, to a lesser extent, the N-terminal domain (NTD) are the predominant targets for neutralizing antibodies, identification of neutralizing epitopes beyond these regions is important for informing vaccine development and understanding antibody-mediated immune escape. Here, we identify a class of broadly neutralizing antibodies that bind an epitope on the spike subdomain 1 (SD1) and that have arisen from infection or vaccination. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we show that SD1-specific antibody P008_60 binds an epitope that is not accessible within the canonical prefusion states of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, suggesting a transient conformation of the viral glycoprotein that is vulnerable to neutralization.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms governing regional human adipose tissue (AT) development remain undefined. Here, we show that the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense RNA) is exclusively expressed in gluteofemoral AT, where it is essential for adipocyte development. We find that HOTAIR interacts with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and we identify core HOTAIR-PRC2 target genes involved in adipocyte lineage determination. Repression of target genes coincides with PRC2 promoter occupancy and H3K27 trimethylation. HOTAIR is also involved in modifying the gluteal adipocyte transcriptome through alternative splicing. Gluteal-specific expression of HOTAIR is maintained by defined regions of open chromatin across the HOTAIR promoter. HOTAIR expression levels can be modified by hormonal (estrogen, glucocorticoids) and genetic variation (rs1443512 is a HOTAIR eQTL associated with reduced gynoid fat mass). These data identify HOTAIR as a dynamic regulator of the gluteal adipocyte transcriptome and epigenome with functional importance for human regional AT development.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoglycemia is a clinical hallmark of severe malaria, the often-lethal outcome of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Here, we report that malaria-associated hypoglycemia emerges from a non-canonical resistance mechanism, whereby the infected host reduces glycemia to starve Plasmodium. This hypometabolic response is elicited by labile heme, a byproduct of hemolysis that induces illness-induced anorexia and represses hepatic glucose production. While transient repression of hepatic glucose production prevents unfettered immune-mediated inflammation, organ damage, and anemia, when sustained over time it leads to hypoglycemia, compromising host energy expenditure and adaptive thermoregulation. The latter arrests the development of asexual stages of Plasmodium via a mechanism associated with parasite mitochondrial dysfunction. In response, Plasmodium activates a transcriptional program associated with the reduction of virulence and sexual differentiation toward the generation of transmissible gametocytes. In conclusion, malaria-associated hypoglycemia represents a trade-off of a hypometabolic-based defense strategy that balances parasite virulence versus transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-SCNC) is associated with an epithelial lineage switch from an androgen receptor (AR)-positive to neuroendocrine (NE)-marker-positive status. Understanding the potential for reversibility of this aggressive disease state has been hampered by the paucity of models suitable for studying rate-limiting, transitional, or intermediate tumor cell subpopulations. We define a dual reporter model that measures acute transcriptional changes in response to castration or AR targeting agents. We identify steady-state transcriptional heterogeneity in AR and NE biomarkers, including intermediate subpopulations that are coordinately high for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and neuron-specific enoclase (NSE) promoter activity. In the presence of castration or AR inhibitors, intermediate cells were necessary and sufficient for therapy-induced conversion of human PC cells to an NSE-high transcriptional status. Using hormone add-back studies, treatment-induced PSA-NSE transcriptional plasticity was reversible in PTEN-deficient PC cells but not in the presence of secondary genetic driver genes, including MYCN.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to normal type I collagen (Col1) heterotrimer (α1/α2/α1) produced by fibroblasts, pancreatic cancer cells specifically produce unique Col1 homotrimer (α1/α1/α1). Col1 homotrimer results from epigenetic suppression of the Col1a2 gene and promotes oncogenic signaling, cancer cell proliferation, tumor organoid formation, and growth via α3β1 integrin on cancer cells, associated with tumor microbiome enriched in anaerobic Bacteroidales in hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumors. Deletion of Col1 homotrimers increases overall survival of mice with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), associated with reprograming of the tumor microbiome with increased microaerophilic Campylobacterales, which can be reversed with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Deletion of Col1 homotrimers enhances T cell infiltration and enables efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. This study identifies the functional impact of Col1 homotrimers on tumor microbiome and tumor immunity, implicating Col1 homotrimer-α3β1 integrin signaling axis as a cancer-specific therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
We present the transcriptomic changes underlying the development of an extreme neuroanatomical sex difference. The robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) is a key component of the songbird vocal motor system. In zebra finch, the RA is initially monomorphic and then atrophies in females but grows up to 7-fold larger in males. Mirroring this divergence, we show here that sex-differential gene expression in the RA expands from hundreds of predominantly sex chromosome Z genes in early development to thousands of predominantly autosomal genes by the time sexual dimorphism asymptotes. Male-specific developmental processes include cell and axonal growth, synapse assembly and activity, and energy metabolism; female-specific processes include cell polarity and differentiation, transcriptional repression, and steroid hormone and immune signaling. Transcription factor binding site analyses support female-biased activation of pro-apoptotic regulatory networks. The extensive and sex-specific transcriptomic reorganization of RA provides insights into potential drivers of sexually dimorphic neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Introduction
Suprabasin is a newly discovered protein linked to various human diseases including cancer. It may does have an effect on the development and expression of some non-melanoma skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). BCC is the most common non-melanoma skin cancers worldwide, while SCC comes as the second in terms of prevalence. In certain cases, it is very important to distinguish between these two carcinomas from each other and from normal skin samples. This study was aimed at investigating the characteristics of suprabasin expression in squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma and whether it can be used as a biomarker.
Materials and methods
Thirty control, ninety SCC and thirty BCC cases obtained from the archives of the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Fırat University, were examined by immunohistochemical staining for suprabasin.
Results
Increased suprabasin expression was observed in tumour tissues and normal skin samples in SCC. As the grade increased in SCC, suprabasin expression decreased. No suprabasin expression was observed in the lesion area in BCC.
Conclusion
Suprabasin can be reported as a biomarker for SCC and used to differentiate SCC from BCC. Expression of suprabasin in SCC can be used to determine grade. Absence of suprabasin expression in BCC can be used for differential diagnosis

Abstract: Summary
p53 genes are conserved transcriptional activators that respond to stress. These proteins can also downregulate genes, but the mechanisms are not understood and are generally assumed to be indirect. Here, we investigate synthetic and native cis-regulatory elements in Drosophila to examine opposing features of p53-mediated transcriptional control in vivo. We show that transcriptional repression by p53 operates continuously through canonical DNA binding sites that confer p53-dependent transactivation at earlier developmental stages. p53 transrepression is correlated with local H3K9me3 chromatin marks and occurs without the need for stress or Chk2. In sufficiency tests, two p53 isoforms qualify as transrepressors and a third qualifies as a transcriptional activator. Targeted isoform-specific knockouts dissociate these opposing transcriptional activities, highlighting features that are dispensable for transactivation but critical for repression and for proper germ cell formation. Together, these results demonstrate that certain p53 isoforms function as constitutive tissue-specific repressors, raising important implications for tumor suppression by the human counterpart.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrosis is the major risk factor associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-driven chronic liver disease. Although numerous efforts have been made to identify the mediators of the initiation of liver fibrosis, the molecular underpinnings of fibrosis progression remain poorly understood, and therapies to arrest liver fibrosis progression are elusive. Here, we identify a pathway involving WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) and myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) as a central mechanism driving liver fibrosis progression through the integrin-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of myofibroblast cytoskeleton and motility. In mice, WISP1 deficiency protects against fibrosis progression, but not fibrosis onset. Moreover, the therapeutic administration of a novel antibody blocking WISP1 halted the progression of existing liver fibrosis in NASH models. These findings implicate the WISP1-MRTF axis as a crucial determinant of liver fibrosis progression and support targeting this pathway by antibody-based therapy for the treatment of NASH fibrosis.

Abstract: The ER-resident proteins STIM1 together with the plasma membrane (PM)-localized Orai1 channels constitute the molecular components of the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway. Prepositioning of STIM1 to the peripheral ER close to the PM ensures its efficient interaction with Orai1 upon a decrease in the ER luminal Ca2+ concentration. The C-terminal polybasic domain of STIM1 has been identified as mediating the interaction with PM phosphoinositides and hence positions the molecule to ER-PM contact sites. Here we show that STIM1 requires PM phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) for efficient PM interaction. Accordingly, oxysterol binding protein related proteins (ORPs) that work at ER-PM junctions and consume PI4P gradients exert important control over the Ca2+ entry process. These studies reveal an important connection between non-vesicular lipid transport at ER-PM contact sites and regulation of ER Ca2+store refilling.

Abstract: Summary
Red blood cells (RBCs) (erythrocytes) are the simplest primary human cells, lacking nuclei and major organelles and instead employing about a thousand proteins to dynamically control cellular function and morphology in response to physiological cues. In this study, we define a canonical RBC proteome and interactome using quantitative mass spectrometry and machine learning. Our data reveal an RBC interactome dominated by protein homeostasis, redox biology, cytoskeletal dynamics, and carbon metabolism. We validate protein complexes through electron microscopy and chemical crosslinking and, with these data, build 3D structural models of the ankyrin/Band 3/Band 4.2 complex that bridges the spectrin cytoskeleton to the RBC membrane. The model suggests spring-like compression of ankyrin may contribute to the characteristic RBC cell shape and flexibility. Taken together, our study provides an in-depth view of the global protein organization of human RBCs and serves as a comprehensive resource for future research.

Abstract: Summary
Both Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) EVADR are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but their relationship with CRC metastasis and the mechanisms by which EVADR promotes CRC metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we report that F. nucleatum promotes colorectal cancer cell metastasis to the liver and lung and that it can be detected in CRC-metastasis colonization in mouse models. Furthermore, F. nucleatum upregulates the expression of EVADR, which can increase the metastatic ability of CRC cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, elevated EVADR serves as a modular scaffold for the Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) to directly enhance the translation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors, such as Snail, Slug, and Zeb1. These findings suggest that EVADR induced by F. nucleatum promotes colorectal cancer metastasis through YBX1-dependent translation. The EVADR-YBX1 axis may be useful for the prevention and treatment of patients with F. nucleatum-associated CRC metastasis.

Abstract: Objective
Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the common gynecological malignant tumors. Cell division cycle-associated protein-3 (CDCA3) is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. The role of CDCA3 in OC was explored in this study.
Methods
The expression of CDCA3 in OC was evaluated in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and further verified by qRT-PCR and Western blot (WB). Subsequently, we established lentivirus-mediated CDCA3 knockdown in OC cell lines HO-8910 and A2780. The biological roles of CDCA3 on proliferation, sensitivity to cisplatin, apoptosis, migration and tumor formation of OC were investigated using loss-of-function assays.
Results
CDCA3 was frequently up-regulated in OC. Knockdown of CDAC3 inhibited proliferation and migration, and enhanced apoptosis as well as sensitivity of OC cells to cisplatin. In vivo results further confirmed the inhibitory effect of CDCA3 knockdown on tumor growth.
Conclusions
Our findings indicated that CDCA3 may play an important role in OC progression, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the OC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and sustained activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes in obesity. UPR signaling is a complex signaling pathway, which is still being explored in many different cellular processes. Here, we demonstrate that FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11), which is transcriptionally regulated by XBP1s, is severely reduced in the livers of obese mice. Restoring hepatic FKBP11 expression in obese mice initiates an atypical UPR signaling pathway marked by rewiring of PERK signaling toward NRF2, away from the eIF2α-ATF4 axis of the UPR. This alteration in UPR signaling establishes glucose homeostasis without changing hepatic ER stress, food consumption, or body weight. We conclude that ER stress during obesity can be beneficially rewired to promote glucose homeostasis. These findings may uncover possible new avenues in the development of novel approaches to treat diseases marked by ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a random, permanent, and developmentally early epigenetic event that occurs during mammalian embryogenesis. We harness these features to investigate characteristics of early lineage specification events during human development. We initially assess the consistency of X-inactivation and establish a robust set of XCI-escape genes. By analyzing variance in XCI ratios across tissues and individuals, we find that XCI is shared across all tissues, suggesting that XCI is completed in the epiblast (in at least 6–16 cells) prior to specification of the germ layers. Additionally, we exploit tissue-specific variability to characterize the number of cells present during tissue-lineage commitment, ranging from approximately 20 cells in liver and whole blood tissues to 80 cells in brain tissues. By investigating the variability of XCI ratios using adult tissue, we characterize embryonic features of human XCI and lineage specification that are otherwise difficult to ascertain experimentally.

Abstract: Summary
Cadherins and integrins are intrinsically linked through the actin cytoskeleton and are largely responsible for the mechanical integrity and organization of tissues. We show that cadherin clustering stimulates and spatially guides integrin activation. Adherens junction (AJ)-associated integrin activation depends on locally generated tension and does not require extracellular matrix ligands. It leads to the creation of primed integrin clusters, which spatially determine where focal adhesions will form if ligands are present and where ligands will be deposited. AJs that display integrin activation are targeted by microtubules facilitating their disassembly via caveolin-based endocytosis, showing that integrin activation impacts the stability of the core cadherin complex. Thus, the interplay between cadherins and integrins is more intimate than what was once believed and is rooted in the capacity of active integrins to be stabilized via AJ-generated tension. Altogether, our data establish a mechanism of cross-regulation between cadherins and integrins.

Abstract: Summary
Although COVID-19 vaccines have been developed, multiple pathogenic coronavirus species exist, urging on development of multispecies coronavirus vaccines. Here we develop prototype lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 Delta, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, and we test how multiplexing LNP-mRNAs can induce effective immune responses in animal models. Triplex and duplex LNP-mRNA vaccinations induce antigen-specific antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiles the global systemic immune repertoires and respective transcriptome signatures of vaccinated animals, revealing a systemic increase in activated B cells and differential gene expression across major adaptive immune cells. Sequential vaccination shows potent antibody responses against all three species, significantly stronger than simultaneous vaccination in mixture. These data demonstrate the feasibility, antibody responses, and single-cell immune profiles of multispecies coronavirus vaccination. The direct comparison between simultaneous and sequential vaccination offers insights into optimization of vaccination schedules to provide broad and potent antibody immunity against three major pathogenic coronavirus species.

Abstract: Summary
Bungarus multicinctus is a widely distributed and medically important elapid snake that produces lethal neurotoxic venom. To study and enhance existing antivenom, we explore the complete repertoire of its toxin genes based on de novo chromosome-level assembly and multi-tissue transcriptome data. Comparative genomic analyses suggest that the three-finger toxin family (3FTX) may evolve through the neofunctionalization of flanking LY6E. A long-neglected 3FTX subfamily (i.e., MKA-3FTX) is also investigated. Only one MKA-3FTX gene, which evolves a different protein conformation, is under positive selection and actively transcribed in the venom gland, functioning as a major toxin effector together with MKT-3FTX subfamily homologs. Furthermore, this lethal snake may acquire self-resistance to its β-bungarotoxin via amino acid replacements on fast-evolving KCNA2. This study provides valuable resources for further evolutionary and structure-function studies of snake toxins, which are fundamental for the development of effective antivenoms and drug candidates.

Abstract: To verify whether propofol alleviates liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in mice by regulating Cyp2b10/ Cyp3a25 pathway. The liver I/R injury in vivo and in vitro model was constructed. The serum level of AST, ALT, ALP and ALB was detected using ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression of Cyp2b10 and Cyp3a25 were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The liver cell activity was assessed by MTT assay. The binding between Cyp2b10 and Cyp3a25 was evaluated by online website prediction, CoIP, and cell transfection with Cyp2b10 siRNA and pcDNA3.1-Cyp3a25. The hepatocyte apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry assay. The serum level of AST, ALT, ALP was increased and that of ALB was decreased in liver I/R injury in vivo model. Also, the mRNA and protein expression of Cyp2b10 and Cyp3a25 were enhanced and reduced in liver I/R injury in vivo and vitro model respectively. The liver cell activity was markedly reduced in H/R cell model. However, these changes were all reversed with propofol treatment. Furthermore, Cyp2b10 could directly bind to Cyp3a25 to regulate the H/R-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. Propofol plays an effect of on liver I/R injury by regulating Cyp2b10/ Cyp3a25 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental processes are intrinsically robust so as to preserve a normal-like state in response to genetic and environmental fluctuations. However, the robustness and potential phenotypic plasticity of individual developing cells under genetic perturbations remain to be systematically evaluated. Using large-scale gene perturbation, live imaging, lineage tracing, and single-cell phenomics, we quantified the phenotypic landscape of C. elegans embryogenesis in >2,000 embryos following individual knockdown of over 750 conserved genes. We observed that cellular genetic systems are not sufficiently robust to single-gene perturbations across all cells; rather, gene knockdowns frequently induced cellular defects. Dynamic phenotypic analyses revealed many cellular defects to be transient, with cells exhibiting phenotypic plasticity that serves to alleviate, correct, and accommodate the defects. Moreover, potential developmentally related cell modules may buffer the phenotypic effects of individual cell position changes. Our findings reveal non-negligible contributions of cellular plasticity and multicellularity as compensatory strategies to increase developmental robustness.

Abstract: Summary
The present study demonstrates how TOP3B is involved in resolving R-loops. We observed elevated R-loops in TOP3B knockout cells (TOP3BKO), which are suppressed by TOP3B transfection. R-loop-inducing agents, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, and the splicing inhibitor pladienolide-B also induce higher R-loops in TOP3BKO cells. Camptothecin- and pladienolide-B-induced R-loops are concurrent with the induction of TOP3B cleavage complexes (TOP3Bccs). RNA/DNA hybrid IP-western blotting show that TOP3B is physically associated with R-loops. Biochemical assays using recombinant TOP3B and oligonucleotides mimicking R-loops show that TOP3B cleaves the single-stranded DNA displaced by the R-loop RNA-DNA duplex. IP-mass spectrometry and IP-western experiments reveal that TOP3B interacts with the R-loop helicase DDX5 independently of TDRD3. Finally, we demonstrate that DDX5 and TOP3B are epistatic in resolving R-loops in a pathway parallel with senataxin. We propose a decatenation model for R-loop resolution by TOP3B-DDX5 protecting cells from R-loop-induced damage.

Abstract: Summary
Lactate accumulates to a significant amount in glioblastomas (GBMs), the most common primary malignant brain tumor with an unfavorable prognosis. However, it remains unclear whether lactate is metabolized by GBMs. Here, we demonstrated that lactate rescued patient-derived xenograft (PDX) GBM cells from nutrient-deprivation-mediated cell death. Transcriptome analysis, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq showed that lactate entertained a signature of oxidative energy metabolism. LC/MS analysis demonstrated that U-13C-lactate elicited substantial labeling of TCA-cycle metabolites, acetyl-CoA, and histone protein acetyl-residues in GBM cells. Lactate enhanced chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation in a manner dependent on oxidative energy metabolism and the ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Utilizing orthotopic PDX models of GBM, a combined tracer experiment unraveled that lactate carbons were substantially labeling the TCA-cycle metabolites. Finally, pharmacological blockage of oxidative energy metabolism extended overall survival in two orthotopic PDX models in mice. These results establish lactate metabolism as a novel druggable pathway for GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Stochastic mechanisms diversify cell fates during development. How cells randomly choose between two or more fates remains poorly understood. In the Drosophila eye, the random mosaic of two R7 photoreceptor subtypes is determined by expression of the transcription factor Spineless (Ss). We investigated how cis-regulatory elements and trans factors regulate nascent transcriptional activity and chromatin compaction at the ss gene locus during R7 development. The ss locus is in a compact state in undifferentiated cells. An early enhancer drives transcription in all R7 precursors, and the locus opens. In differentiating cells, transcription ceases and the ss locus stochastically remains open or compacts. In SsON R7s, ss is open and competent for activation by a late enhancer, whereas in SsOFF R7s, ss is compact, and repression prevents expression. Our results suggest that a temporally dynamic antagonism, in which transcription drives large-scale decompaction and then compaction represses transcription, controls stochastic fate specification.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane protein clients of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation must be retrotranslocated from the ER membrane by the AAA-ATPase p97 for proteasomal degradation. Before direct engagement with p97, client transmembrane domains (TMDs) that have partially or fully crossed the membrane must be constantly shielded to avoid non-native interactions. How client TMDs are seamlessly escorted from the membrane to p97 is unknown. Here, we identified ER-anchored TMUB1 as a TMD-specific escortase. TMUB1 interacts with the TMD of clients within the membrane and holds ∼10–14 residues of a hydrophobic sequence that is exposed out of membrane, using its transmembrane and cytosolic regions, respectively. The ubiquitin-like domain of TMUB1 recruits p97, which can pull client TMDs from bound TMUB1 into the cytosol. The disruption of TMUB1 escortase activity impairs retrotranslocation and stabilizes retrotranslocating intermediates of client proteins within the ER membrane. Thus, TMUB1 promotes TMD segregation by safeguarding the TMD movement from the membrane to p97.

Abstract: CD133, also known as prominin-1, was first identified as a biomarker of mammalian cancer and neural stem cells. Previous studies have shown that the prominin-like (promL) gene, an orthologue of mammalian CD133 in Drosophila, plays a role in glucose and lipid metabolism, body growth, and longevity. Because locomotion is required for food sourcing and ultimately the regulation of metabolism, we examined the function of promL in Drosophila locomotion. Both promL mutants and pan-neuronal promL inhibition flies displayed reduced spontaneous locomotor activity. As dopamine is known to modulate locomotion, we also examined the effects of promL inhibition on the dopamine concentration and mRNA expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DOPA decarboxylase (Ddc), the enzymes responsible for dopamine biosynthesis, in the heads of flies. Compared with those in control flies, the levels of dopamine and the mRNAs encoding TH and Ddc were lower in promL mutant and pan-neuronal promL inhibition flies. In addition, an immunostaining analysis revealed that, compared with control flies, promL mutant and pan-neuronal promL inhibition flies had lower levels of the TH protein in protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) neurons, a subset of dopaminergic neurons. Inhibition of promL in these PAM neurons reduced the locomotor activity of the flies. Overall, these findings indicate that promL expressed in PAM dopaminergic neurons regulates locomotion by controlling dopamine synthesis in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Organoid-based models of murine and human innate lymphoid cell precursor (ILCP) maturation are presented. First, murine intestinal and pulmonary organoids are harnessed to demonstrate that the epithelial niche is sufficient to drive tissue-specific maturation of all innate lymphoid cell (ILC) groups in parallel, without requiring subset-specific cytokine supplementation. Then, more complex human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based gut and lung organoid models are used to demonstrate that human epithelial cells recapitulate maturation of ILC from a stringent systemic human ILCP population, but only when the organoid-associated stromal cells are depleted. These systems offer versatile and reductionist models to dissect the impact of environmental and mucosal niche cues on ILC maturation. In the future, these could provide insight into how ILC activity and development might become dysregulated in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR; Clec4a2), a member of the C-type lectin receptor family, plays important roles in homeostasis of the immune and bone systems. However, the intestinal role of this molecule is unclear. Here, we show that dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and azoxymethane-DSS-induced intestinal tumors are reduced in Clec4a2−/− mice independently of intestinal microbiota. STAT5 phosphorylation and expression of Csf2 and tight junction genes are enhanced, while Il17a and Cxcl2 are suppressed in the Clec4a2−/− mouse colon, which exhibits reduced infiltration of neutrophils and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) administration ameliorates DSS colitis associated with reduced Il17a and enhanced tight junction gene expression, whereas anti-GM-CSF exacerbates symptoms. Furthermore, anti-NA2, a ligand for DCIR, ameliorates colitis and prevents colorectal tumors. These observations indicate that blocking DCIR signaling ameliorates colitis and suppresses colonic tumors, suggesting DCIR as a possible target for the treatment of these diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence suggests that the hippocampus conveys memory-related neural patterns across distributed cortical circuits during high-frequency oscillations called sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). We investigate how circuit activity in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a primary hippocampal target, could aid in processing SWR-related input. Using patch-clamp recordings from awake mice, we find that SWR-aligned membrane potential modulation is widespread but weak, and that spiking responses are sparse. However, using cell-type-specific two-photon Ca2+ imaging and optogenetics, we show that, 1–2 s before SWRs, superficial inhibition and thalamocortical input in RSC is reduced. We propose that pyramidal dendrites experience decreased local inhibition and subcortical interference in a seconds-long time window preceding SWRs. This may aid communication of weak and sparse SWR-aligned excitation between the hippocampus and neocortex and promote the strengthening of memory-related connections.

Abstract: Human ABCB6 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that regulates heme biosynthesis by translocating various porphyrins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human ABCB6 with its substrates, coproporphyrin III (CPIII) and hemin, at 3.5 and 3.7 Å resolution, respectively. Metal-free porphyrin CPIII binds to ABCB6 within the central cavity, where its propionic acids form hydrogen bonds with the highly conserved Y550. The resulting structure has an overall fold similar to the inward-facing apo structure, but the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are slightly closer to each other. In contrast, when ABCB6 binds a metal-centered porphyrin hemin in complex with two glutathione molecules (1 hemin: 2 glutathione), the two NBDs end up much closer together, aligning them to bind and hydrolyze ATP more efficiently. In our structures, a glycine-rich and highly flexible “bulge” loop on TM helix 7 undergoes significant conformational changes associated with substrate binding. Our findings suggest that ABCB6 utilizes at least two distinct mechanisms to fine-tune substrate specificity and transport efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
The genomic positions of nucleosomes are a defining feature of the cell’s epigenomic state, but signal-dependent transcription factors (SDTFs), upon activation, bind to specific genomic locations and modify nucleosome positioning. Here we leverage SDTFs as perturbation probes to learn about nucleosome dynamics in living cells. We develop Markov models of nucleosome dynamics and fit them to time course sequencing data of DNA accessibility. We find that (1) the dynamics of DNA unwrapping are significantly slower in cells than reported from cell-free experiments, (2) only models with cooperativity in wrapping and unwrapping fit the available data, (3) SDTF activity produces the highest eviction probability when its binding site is adjacent to but not on the nucleosome dyad, and (4) oscillatory SDTF activity results in high location variability. Our work uncovers the regulatory rules governing SDTF-induced nucleosome dynamics in live cells, which can predict chromatin accessibility alterations during inflammation at single-nucleosome resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Reoccurring/high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) tumors have the enrichment of non-RAS/RAF mutations along the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, suggesting that activation of MEK/ERK is critical for their survival. However, based on preclinical data, MEK inhibitors are unlikely to be active in NB and have demonstrated dose-limiting toxicities that limit their use. Here, we explore an alternative way to target the MAPK pathway in high-risk NB. We find that NB models are among the most sensitive among over 900 tumor-derived cell lines to the allosteric SHP2 inhibitor SHP099. Sensitivity to SHP099 in NB is greater in models with loss or low expression of the RAS GTPase activation protein (GAP) neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Furthermore, NF1 is lower in advanced and relapsed NB and NF1 loss is enriched in high-risk NB tumors regardless of MYCN status. SHP2 inhibition consistently blocks tumor growth in high-risk NB mouse models, revealing a new drug target in relapsed NB.

Abstract: Summary
Sequence variants in cis-acting enhancers are important for polygenic disease, but their role in Mendelian disease is poorly understood. Redundancy between enhancers that regulate the same gene is thought to mitigate the pathogenic impact of enhancer mutations. Recent findings, however, have shown that loss-of-function mutations in a single enhancer near PTF1A cause pancreas agenesis and neonatal diabetes. Using mouse and human genetic models, we show that this enhancer activates an entire PTF1A enhancer cluster in early pancreatic multipotent progenitors. This leading role, therefore, precludes functional redundancy. We further demonstrate that transient expression of PTF1A in multipotent progenitors sets in motion an epigenetic cascade that is required for duct and endocrine differentiation. These findings shed insights into the genome regulatory mechanisms that drive pancreas differentiation. Furthermore, they reveal an enhancer that acts as a regulatory master key and is thus vulnerable to pathogenic loss-of-function mutations.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of target messenger RNA (mRNA) complementary to the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) at the post-transcriptional level. Hsa-miR-422a, which is commonly known as miRNA derived from transposable element (MDTE), was derived from short interspersed nuclear element (SINE). Through expression analysis, hsa-miR-422a was found to be highly expressed in both the small intestine and liver of crab-eating monkey. AT-Rich Interaction Domain 5 B (ARID5B) was selected as the target gene of hsa-miR-422a, which has two binding sites in both the exon and 3’UTR of ARID5B. To identify the interaction between hsa-miR-422a and ARID5B, a dual luciferase assay was conducted in HepG2 cell line. The luciferase activity of cells treated with the hsa-miR-422a mimic was upregulated and inversely downregulated when both the hsa-miR-422a mimic and inhibitor were administered. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 (NF-E2) was selected as the core transcription factor (TF) via feed forward loop analysis. The luciferase expression was downregulated when both the hsa-miR-422a mimic and siRNA of NF-E2 were treated, compared to the treatment of the hsa-miR-422a mimic alone. The present study suggests that hsa-miR-422a derived from SINE could bind to the exon region as well as the 3’UTR of ARID5B. Additionally, hsa-miR-422a was found to share binding sites in ARID5B with several TFs, including NF-E2. The hsa-miR-422a might thus interact with TF to regulate the expression of ARID5B, as demonstrated experimentally. Altogether, hsa-miR-422a acts as a super enhancer miRNA of ARID5B by collaborating with TF and NF-E2.

We show that glioma cells can sustain growth independent of immune system constraint by reducing Notch signaling. Loss of Notch activity in a mouse model of glioma impairs MHC-I and cytokine expression and curtails the recruitment of anti-tumor immune cell populations in favor of immunosuppressive tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs). Depletion of T cells simulates Notch inhibition and facilitates tumor initiation. Furthermore, Notch-depleted glioma cells acquire resistance to interferon-γ and TAMs re-educating therapy. Decreased interferon response and cytokine expression by human and mouse glioma cells correlate with low Notch activity. These effects are paralleled by upregulation of oncogenes and downregulation of quiescence genes. Hence, suppression of Notch signaling enables gliomas to evade immune surveillance and increases aggressiveness. Our findings provide insights into how brain tumor cells shape their microenvironment to evade immune niche control.

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) bind to the parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTH1R) and activate the stimulatory G-protein (Gs) signaling pathway. Intriguingly, the two ligands have distinct signaling and physiological properties: PTH evokes prolonged Gs activation, whereas PTHrP evokes transient Gs activation with reduced bone-resorption effects. The distinct molecular actions are ascribed to the differences in ligand recognition and dissociation kinetics. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopic structures of six forms of the human PTH1R-Gs complex in the presence of PTH or PTHrP at resolutions of 2.8 –4.1 Å. A comparison of the PTH-bound and PTHrP-bound structures reveals distinct ligand-receptor interactions underlying the ligand affinity and selectivity. Furthermore, five distinct PTH-bound structures, combined with computational analyses, provide insights into the unique and complex process of ligand dissociation from the receptor and shed light on the distinct durations of signaling induced by PTH and PTHrP.

Abstract: Summary
Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) is a severe complication for some respiratory infections. To investigate the potential for VAERD induction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we evaluate two vaccine leads utilizing a severe hamster infection model: a T helper type 1 (TH1)-biased measles vaccine-derived candidate and a TH2-biased alum-adjuvanted, non-stabilized spike protein. The measles virus (MeV)-derived vaccine protects the animals, but the protein lead induces VAERD, which can be alleviated by dexamethasone treatment. Bulk transcriptomic analysis reveals that our protein vaccine prepares enhanced host gene dysregulation in the lung, exclusively up-regulating mRNAs encoding the eosinophil attractant CCL-11, TH2-driving interleukin (IL)-19, or TH2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identifies lung macrophages or lymphoid cells as sources, respectively. Our findings imply that VAERD is caused by the concerted action of hyperstimulated macrophages and TH2 cytokine-secreting lymphoid cells and potentially links VAERD to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In summary, we identify the cytokine drivers and cellular contributors that mediate VAERD after TH2-biased vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomes readily unlink and segregate to daughter cells during cell division, highlighting a remarkable ability of cells to organize long DNA molecules. SMC complexes promote DNA organization by loop extrusion. In most bacteria, chromosome folding initiates at dedicated start sites marked by the ParB/parS partition complexes. Whether SMC complexes recognize a specific DNA structure in the partition complex or a protein component is unclear. By replacing genes in Bacillus subtilis with orthologous sequences from Streptococcus pneumoniae, we show that the three subunits of the bacterial Smc complex together with the ParB protein form a functional module that can organize and segregate foreign chromosomes. Using chimeric proteins and chemical cross-linking, we find that ParB directly binds the Smc subunit. We map an interface to the Smc joint and the ParB CTP-binding domain. Structure prediction indicates how the ParB clamp presents DNA to the Smc complex, presumably to initiate DNA loop extrusion.

Abstract: Summary
The vast potential of human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in preclinical models of cardiac pathologies, precision medicine, and drug screening remains to be fully realized because hiPSC-CMs are immature without adult-like characteristics. Here, we present a method to accelerate hiPSC-CM maturation on a substrate, cardiac mimetic matrix (CMM), mimicking adult human heart matrix ligand chemistry, rigidity, and submicron ultrastructure, which synergistically mature hiPSC-CMs rapidly within 30 days. hiPSC-CMs matured on CMM exhibit systemic transcriptomic maturation toward an adult heart state, are aligned with high strain energy, metabolically rely on oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, and display enhanced redox handling capability, efficient calcium handling, and electrophysiological features of ventricular myocytes. Endothelin-1-induced pathological hypertrophy is mitigated on CMM, highlighting the role of a native cardiac microenvironment in withstanding hypertrophy progression. CMM is a convenient model for accelerated development of ventricular myocytes manifesting highly specialized cardiac-specific functions.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a developmental disorder associated with epilepsy, autism, and cognitive impairment. Despite inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and hyperactive mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, the mechanisms underlying TSC-associated neurological symptoms remain incompletely understood. Here we generate a Tsc1 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse model in which Tsc1 inactivation in late embryonic radial glia causes social and cognitive impairment and spontaneous seizures. Tsc1 depletion occurs in a subset of layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons, leading to development of cytomegalic pyramidal neurons (CPNs) that mimic dysplastic neurons in human TSC, featuring abnormal dendritic and axonal overgrowth, enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and increased susceptibility to seizure-like activities. We provide evidence that enhanced synaptic excitation in CPNs contributes to cortical hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis. In contrast, astrocytic regulation of synapse formation and synaptic transmission remains unchanged after late embryonic radial glial Tsc1 inactivation, and astrogliosis evolves secondary to seizures.

Abstract: Summary
In animal germlines, transposons are silenced at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level to prevent deleterious expression. Ciliates employ a more direct approach by physically eliminating transposons from their soma, utilizing piRNAs to recognize transposons and imprecisely excise them. Ancient, mutated transposons often do not require piRNAs and are precisely eliminated. Here, we characterize the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in Paramecium and demonstrate its involvement in the removal of transposons and transposon-derived DNA. Our results reveal a striking difference between the elimination of new and ancient transposons at the chromatin level and show that the complex may be guided by Piwi-bound small RNAs (sRNAs). We propose that imprecise elimination in ciliates originates from an ancient transposon silencing mechanism, much like in plants and metazoans, through sRNAs, repressive methylation marks, and heterochromatin formation. However, it is taken a step further by eliminating DNA as an extreme form of transposon silencing.

Abstract: Summary
Cells with latent stem ability can contribute to mammalian tissue regeneration after damage. Whether the central nervous system (CNS) harbors such cells remains controversial. Here, we report that DNGR-1 lineage tracing in mice identifies an ependymal cell subset, wherein resides latent regenerative potential. We demonstrate that DNGR-1-lineage-traced ependymal cells arise early in embryogenesis (E11.5) and subsequently spread across the lining of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled compartments to form a contiguous sheet from the brain to the end of the spinal cord. In the steady state, these DNGR-1-traced cells are quiescent, committed to their ependymal cell fate, and do not contribute to neuronal or glial lineages. However, trans-differentiation can be induced in adult mice by CNS injury or in vitro by culture with suitable factors. Our findings highlight previously unappreciated ependymal cell heterogeneity and identify across the entire CNS an ependymal cell subset wherein resides damage-responsive neural stem cell potential.

Abstract: Summary
The proteome provides unique insights into disease biology beyond the genome and transcriptome. A lack of large proteomic datasets has restricted the identification of new cancer biomarkers. Here, proteomes of 949 cancer cell lines across 28 tissue types are analyzed by mass spectrometry. Deploying a workflow to quantify 8,498 proteins, these data capture evidence of cell-type and post-transcriptional modifications. Integrating multi-omics, drug response, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality screens with a deep learning-based pipeline reveals thousands of protein biomarkers of cancer vulnerabilities that are not significant at the transcript level. The power of the proteome to predict drug response is very similar to that of the transcriptome. Further, random downsampling to only 1,500 proteins has limited impact on predictive power, consistent with protein networks being highly connected and co-regulated. This pan-cancer proteomic map (ProCan-DepMapSanger) is a comprehensive resource available at https://cellmodelpassports.sanger.ac.uk.

Abstract: Summary
Type VI CRISPR-Cas13 effector enzymes catalyze RNA-guided RNA cleavage and have been harnessed for various technologies, such as RNA detection, targeting, and editing. Recent studies identified Cas13bt3 (also known as Cas13X.1) as a miniature Cas13 enzyme, which can be used for knockdown and editing of target transcripts in mammalian cells. However, the action mechanism of the compact Cas13bt3 remains unknown. Here, we report the structures of the Cas13bt3-guide RNA complex and the Cas13bt3-guide RNA-target RNA complex. The structures revealed how Cas13bt3 recognizes the guide RNA and its target RNA and provided insights into the activation mechanism of Cas13bt3, which is distinct from those of the other Cas13a/d enzymes. Furthermore, we rationally engineered enhanced Cas13bt3 variants and ultracompact RNA base editors. Overall, this study improves our mechanistic understanding of the CRISPR-Cas13 enzymes and paves the way for the development of efficient Cas13-mediated transcriptome modulation technologies.

Abstract: Summary
Alveolar epithelial cell fate decisions drive lung development and regeneration. Using transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling coupled with genetic mouse and organoid models, we identified the transcription factor Klf5 as an essential determinant of alveolar epithelial cell fate across the lifespan. We show that although dispensable for both adult alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cell homeostasis, Klf5 enforces AT1 cell lineage fidelity during development. Using infectious and non-infectious models of acute respiratory distress syndrome, we demonstrate that Klf5 represses AT2 cell proliferation and enhances AT2-AT1 cell differentiation in a spatially restricted manner during lung regeneration. Moreover, ex vivo organoid assays identify that Klf5 reduces AT2 cell sensitivity to inflammatory signaling to drive AT2-AT1 cell differentiation. These data define the roll of a major transcriptional regulator of AT1 cell lineage commitment and of the AT2 cell response to inflammatory crosstalk during lung regeneration.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the 4th leading cause of cancer-related deaths, although with a dismal prognosis. The SIAH E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 2 (SIAH2) regulates the expression of multiple proteins via ubiquitination and proteasome. However, the biological role of SIAH2 in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis remains controversial. In this work, we found that SIAH2 is an oncogene in colorectal cancer. Moreover, SIAH2 promoted colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation. Mechanistically, SIAH2 promoted the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, we discovered that PTEN loss regulates SIAH2-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation. In summary, these findings highlight the role of SIAH2 in colorectal cancer progression and provide novel insights for treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of eye disorders have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with ocular disease. However, the vast majority of these variants are noncoding, making it challenging to interpret their function. Here we present a joint single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility of the adult human retina with more than 50,000 cells, which we used to analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated by GWASs of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, myopia, and type 2 macular telangiectasia. We integrate this atlas with a HiChIP enhancer connectome, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data, and base-resolution deep learning models to predict noncoding SNPs with causal roles in eye disease, assess SNP impact on transcription factor binding, and define their known and novel target genes. Our efforts nominate pathogenic SNP-target gene interactions for multiple vision disorders and provide a potentially powerful resource for interpreting noncoding variation in the eye.

Abstract: Summary
Focal adhesions are multifunctional organelles that couple cell-matrix adhesion to cytoskeletal force transmission and signaling and to steer cell migration and collective cell behavior. Whereas proteomic changes at focal adhesions are well understood, little is known about signaling lipids in focal adhesion dynamics. Through the characterization of cells from mice with a kinase-inactivating point mutation in the class II PI3K-C2β, we find that generation of the phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) membrane lipid promotes focal adhesion disassembly in response to changing environmental conditions. We show that reduced growth factor signaling sensed by protein kinase N, an mTORC2 target and effector of RhoA, synergizes with the adhesion disassembly factor DEPDC1B to induce local synthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P2 by PI3K-C2β. PtdIns(3,4)P2 then promotes turnover of RhoA-dependent stress fibers by recruiting the PtdIns(3,4)P2-dependent RhoA-GTPase-activating protein ARAP3. Our findings uncover a pathway by which cessation of growth factor signaling facilitates cell-matrix adhesion disassembly via a phosphoinositide lipid switch.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells and can be isolated from many tissues of the body. Due to their potentials to treat various diseases and be applied in animal breeding, MSCs have been isolated and identified regarding their biological properties. Common hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) are a vulnerable species and yet the cryopreservation of their genetic materials is scare. In this study, we successfully established two MSC cultures (UC-MSCs and AT-MSCs) from the umbilical cord and adipose tissue of a neonatal common hippo and comparatively described their features. Both UC-MSCs and AT-MSCs showed fibroblastoid morphology and could be continuously passaged for over 17 passages without dramatic signs of senescence. The cell cultures had normal chromosome composition, say, 17 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of X chromosomes. UC-MSCs and AT-MSCs displayed similar gene expression profiles. They were positive for CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90 and CD105 and negative for HLA-DR. They demonstrated stemness maintenance by expression of classical stem cell markers. UC-MSCs and AT-MSCs manifested different differentiation potentials into other cell lineages. In summary, these two cell cultures demonstrated the essential properties of mesenchymal stem cells and might play a role in the future research.

Abstract: Human adipose stem cells (ASCs) hold great potential for regenerative medicine approaches, including osteogenic regeneration of bone defects, that fail to heal autonomously. Osteogenic differentiation of stem cells is dependent on the stimulation of biophysical factors. In the present study, the effects of hypergravity, hypoxia, and hyperbaric treatment were investigated on adipose stem cell (ASC) metabolic activity, quantified by PrestoBlue conversion, and cell numbers, evaluated by crystal violet staining. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and cresolphthalein staining of calcium deposition. Differentiation was performed for 12 days, which was accompanied by periodical stimulation. Increasing gravity forces up to 50x g did not affect ASC viability, but it enhanced osteogenic markers with a strongest effect between 20 and 30x g. Hyperbaric stimulation at 3 bar decreased ASC cell numbers but increased ALP activity and calcium deposition. Hypoxia at 8 % atmospheric oxygen did not affect ASC proliferation, while cell numbers were reduced at 3 % oxygen. Furthermore, hypoxic conditions produced opposing results on osteogenic markers, as ALP activity increased whereas cresolphthalein staining decreased upon stimulation. These data demonstrated that intermittent short duration of basal physical or chemical impulses interfere with the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs. Our findings could be of specific relevance in ASC based therapies for regenerative medicine and bone tissue engineering approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence suggests that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) are associated with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, GRKs have not been directly implicated in regulation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) pathogenic cascade in AD. Here, we determine that GRKs phosphorylate a non-canonical substrate, anterior pharynx-defective 1A (APH1A), an integral component of the γ-secretase complex. Significantly, we show that GRKs generate distinct phosphorylation barcodes in intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) and the C terminus of APH1A, which differentially regulate recruitment of the scaffolding protein β-arrestin 2 (βarr2) to APH1A and γ-secretase-mediated Aβ generation. Further molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal an interaction between the βarr2 finger loop domain and ICL2 and ICL3 of APH1A, similar to a GPCR-β-arrestin complex, which regulates γ-secretase activity. Collectively, these studies provide insight into the molecular and structural determinants of the APH1A-βarr2 interaction that critically regulate Aβ generation.

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) derived from genotype data and family history (FH) of disease provide valuable information for predicting disease risk, but PRSs perform poorly when applied to diverse populations. Here, we explore methods for combining both types of information (PRS-FH) in UK Biobank data. PRSs were trained using all British individuals (n = 409,000), and target samples consisted of unrelated non-British Europeans (n = 42,000), South Asians (n = 7,000), or Africans (n = 7,000). We evaluated PRS, FH, and PRS-FH using liability-scale R2, primarily focusing on 3 well-powered diseases (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression). PRS attained average prediction R2s of 5.8%, 4.0%, and 0.53% in non-British Europeans, South Asians, and Africans, confirming poor cross-population transferability. In contrast, PRS-FH attained average prediction R2s of 13%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, representing a large improvement in Europeans and an extremely large improvement in Africans. In conclusion, including family history improves the accuracy of polygenic risk scores, particularly in diverse populations.
