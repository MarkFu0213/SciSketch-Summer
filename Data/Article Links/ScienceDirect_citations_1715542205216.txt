Abstract: The surface photovoltage (SPV) and carrier accumulation in open circuit conditions are sensitive indicators of the contact quality and band bending. However, these are not accessible directly in experiments. We analyze the capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics in P3HT:PCBM based bulk heterojunction to investigate SPV for both conventional (transparent anode) and inverted (transparent cathode) architectures. The C-V characteristics under dark conditions are analyzed using drift-diffusion model to extract built-in voltage, while under white light illumination it yields SPV. The SPV and the corresponding carrier density at the anode are quantified as a function of light intensity for conventional structure and compared with those of inverted structure to distinguish between the mechanisms in the two cases. The inverted structure with higher open circuit voltage is marked with less SPV compared to the conventional one. The technique of obtaining SPV as described here and the underlying mechanism can be used to suggest modifications in device architecture.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence that the presence of mobile ions in perovskite solar cells can cause a current-voltage curve hysteresis. However, it is still subject of ongoing debates how exactly mobile ions influence the device operation. We use drift-diffusion simulations incorporating mobile ions to describe IV-curves of preconditioned methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cells and compare them with experimental results. Our simulation results show that the hysteresis depends on the extent of surface recombination and on the diffusion length of charge carriers. We provide a detailed explanation for the reduced hysteresis of perovskite solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies. We find that in high-efficiency solar cells ion migration is still present, but does not cause a hysteresis effect. In these devices charge extraction is mainly driven by diffusion of free electrons and holes.

Abstract: Dexpramipexole, an orally bioavailable small molecule previously under clinical development in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was observed during routine safety hematology monitoring to demonstrate pronounced, dose- and time-dependent eosinophil-lowering effects, with minor reductions on other leukocyte counts. Analysis of hematology lab values across two double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials at total daily doses ranging from 50mg to 300mg demonstrated that dexpramipexole consistently and markedly lowered peripheral blood eosinophils. This effect developed after 1month on treatment, required 3–4months to reach its maximum, remained constant throughout treatment, and partially recovered to baseline levels upon drug withdrawal. All doses tested were well tolerated. The overall adverse event rate was similar for dexpramipexole and placebo, and notably with no increase in infection-related adverse events associated with eosinophil-lowering effects. Given the reliance on and insufficiency of off-label chronic corticosteroid therapy for hypereosinophilic syndromes and other eosinophilic-associated diseases (EADs), a need exists for less toxic, more effective, targeted therapeutic alternatives. Further clinical studies are underway to assess the eosinophil-lowering effect of dexpramipexole in the peripheral blood and target tissues of EAD patients and whether such reductions, if observed, produce clinically important benefits.

Abstract: Telomerase activity is regulated by alternative splicing of its catalytic subunit human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA. Induction of a non-active spliced hTERT leads to inhibition of telomerase activity. However, very little is known about the mechanism of hTERT mRNA alternative splicing. The aim of this study was to determine the role of the apoptotic endonuclease EndoG in alternative splicing of hTERT and telomerase activity. A strong correlation was identified between EndoG expression levels and hTERT splice variants in human CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Overexpression of EndoG in CD4+ T cells down-regulated the expression of the active full-length hTERT variant and up-regulated expression of the non-active spliced variant. A reduction in full-length hTERT transcripts down-regulated telomerase activity. Long-term in vitro cultivation of EndoG-overexpressing CD4+ T cells led to dramatically shortened telomeres, conversion of cells into a replicative senescence state, and activation of the BCL2/BAX-associated apoptotic pathway finally leading to cell death. These data indicated the participation of EndoG in alternative mRNA splicing of the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT, regulation of telomerase activity and determination of cell fate.

Identification of syntaxin 4 as an essential factor for the hepatitis C virus life cycle,

Abstract: Although there is evidence that multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are involved in the release of hepatitis C virus (HCV), many aspects of HCV release are still not fully understood. The amount of α-taxilin that prevents SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex formation by binding to free syntaxin 4 is reduced in HCV-positive cells. Therefore, it was analyzed whether the t-SNARE protein syntaxin 4 which mediates vesicles fusion is involved in the HCV life cycle. HCV-positive cells possess an increased amount of syntaxin 4 protein, although the amount of syntaxin 4-specific transcripts is decreased in HCV-positive Huh7.5 cells and in HCV-infected primary human hepatocytes. In HCV-positive cells a significant longer half-life of syntaxin 4 was found that overcompensates for the decreased expression and leads to the elevated level of syntaxin 4. Overexpression of syntaxin 4 reduces the intracellular amount of infectious viral particles by facilitating viral release, while silencing of syntaxin 4 expression using specific siRNAs inhibits the release of HCV particles and so leads to an increase in the intracellular amount of infectious viral particles. This indicates that HCV uses a SNARE-dependent pathway for viral release. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a colocalization of syntaxin 4 with a MVB-specific marker, exosomes and HCV core, which suggests a fraction of syntaxin 4 is associated with exosomes loaded with HCV. Altogether, it is assumed that syntaxin 4 is a novel essential cellular factor for the release of HCV.

Abstract: Giardia intestinalis (G.I), is an anaerobic protozoan and the aetiological agent of giardiasis, a diarrhoea present worldwide and associated with poverty. G.I has a simple life cycle alternating between cyst and trophozoite. Cysts are transmitted orally to the stomach and transform to trophozoites in the intestine by a multifactorial process. Recently, microvesicles (MVs) have been found to be released from a wide range of eukaryotic cells. We have observed a release of MVs during the life cycle of G.I., identifying MVs from active trophozoites and from trophozoites differentiating to the cyst form. The aim of the current work was to investigate the role of MVs from G.I in the pathogenesis of giardiasis. MVs from log phase were able to increase the attachment of G. intestinalis trophozoites to Caco-2 cells. Moreover, MVs from G. intestinalis could be captured by human immature dendritic cells, resulting in increased activation and allostimulation of human dendritic cells. Lipid rafts participate in the MV biogenesis and in the attachment to Caco-2 cells. Nevertheless, proteomic analysis from two types of MVs has shown slight differences at the protein levels. An understanding of biogenesis and content of MVs derived from trophozoites might have important implications in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Abstract: Precise genome editing with desired point mutations can be generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) and is of great significance for gene function study, gene therapy and animal breeding. However, HDR efficiency is inherently low and improvements are necessitated. Herein, we determined that the HDR efficiency could be enhanced by expressing Rad52, a gene that is involved in the homologous recombination process. Both the Rad52 co-expression and Rad52-Cas9 fusion strategies yielded approximately 3-fold increase in HDR during the surrogate reporter assays in human HEK293T cells, as well as in the genome editing assays. Moreover, the enhancement effects of the Rad52-Cas9 fusion on HDR mediated by different (plasmid, PCR and ssDNA) donor templates were confirmed. We found that the HDR efficiency could be significantly improved to about 40% by the combined usage of Rad52 and Scr7. In addition, we also applied the fusion strategy for modifying the IGF2 gene of porcine PK15 cells, which further demonstrated a 2.2-fold increase in HDR frequency. In conclusion, our data suggests that Rad52-Cas9 fusion is a good option for enhancing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR, which may be of use in future studies involving precise genome editing.

Abstract: Deoxy-hemoglobin S polymerization into rigid fibers is the direct cause of the clinical sequelae observed in sickle cell disease (SCD). The rate of polymerization of sickle hemoglobin is determined primarily by intracellular hemoglobin concentration, itself dependent on the amount of sickle hemoglobin and on red blood cell (RBC) volume. Dense, dehydrated RBC (DRBC) are observed in SCD patients, and their number correlates with hemolytic parameters and complications such as renal dysfunction, leg ulcers and priapism. To identify new genes involved in RBC hydration in SCD, we performed the first genome-wide association study for DRBC in 374 sickle cell anemia (HbSS) patients. We did not find genome-wide significant results, indicating that variants that modulate DRBC have modest-to-weak effects. A secondary analysis demonstrated a nominal association (P=0.003) between DRBC in SCD patients and a variant associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in non-anemic individuals. This intronic variant controls the expression of ATP2B4, the main calcium pump in erythrocytes. Our study highlights ATP2B4 as a promising target for modulation of RBC hydration in SCD patients.

Abstract: Recent studies have reported that polyamines in the colonic lumen might affect animal health and these polyamines are thought to be produced by gut bacteria. In the present study, we measured the concentrations of three polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) in cells and culture supernatants of 32 dominant human gut bacterial species in their growing and stationary phases. Combining polyamine concentration analysis in culture supernatant and cells with available genomic information showed that novel polyamine biosynthetic proteins and transporters were present in dominant human gut bacteria. Based on these findings, we suggested strategies for optimizing polyamine concentrations in the human colonic lumen via regulation of genes responsible for polyamine biosynthesis and transport in the dominant human gut bacteria.

Abstract: The objective of this research was to develop a high emissivity coating on the low thermal conductive insulation for reusable thermal protection system. The design principles including high emissivity, match of the coefficients of thermal expansion and excellent high temperature stability were proposed for the first time. A novel WSi2-Si-glass hybrid coating with optimized composition was successfully prepared on fibrous ZrO2 ceramic insulation by slurry dipping and subsequent high temperature rapid sintering method. The total emissivity of the as-prepared coating is up to 0.92 in wavelength of 0.3–2.5µm. After oxidation at 1673K for 100h and 1773K for 20h, the total emissivity values of the coatings are still as high as 0.89 and 0.87. A competitive mechanism between the “defects formation” caused by aging stress, the CTE mismatch stress and the volatilization of low melting point oxides and the “defects healing” resulted from self–healing phases during the different oxidizing conditions was discussed.

Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of major obstacles to effective chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. This study showed that DHPAC, 2-(6-ethoxy-3-(3-ethoxyphenylamino) −1-methyl-1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazol-7-yloxy) acetamide, a novel compound that binds to the same site on microtubules as colchicine, has high anti-tumour activity in vincristine-resistant oral epidermoid carcinoma (KB/V) cells. It found that the presence of DHPAC strongly inhibited KB/V cell growth in vivo and in mice xenograft. The inhibitory effect of DHPAC is much stronger than that by colchicine in these KB/V cells (IC50: 64.4nM and 458.0nM respectively). Treatment of the cells with DHPAC induced cell apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential and altered the expression of several apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-9, Cytochrome c and PARP. DHPAC treatment also caused cell rest in G2/M phase by regulating of the expression of a number of cell cycle-related proteins (e.g. Cyclin B1, Cdc2, Cdc25b, Cdc25c, RSK2). Furthermore, DHPAC presence inhibits PTEN phosphorylation and PTEN/Akt/NF-κB signalling. Thus, DHPAC has potent anti-cancer activity in MDR tumuors and may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of vincristine-resistant human oral epidermoid carcinoma.

Abstract: We present a detailed optimization of a hole selective rear contact for p–type crystalline silicon solar cells which relies on full-area processes and provides full-area passivation. The passivating hole-contact is based on a layer stack comprising a chemically grown thin silicon oxide, an intrinsic silicon interlayer, and an in-situ boron-doped non-stoichiometric silicon-rich silicon-carbide layer on top. After deposition, the structure is annealed at 775–900°C to diffuse dopant impurities to the c-Si wafer and a hydrogenation step is carried out. It is shown that hydrogenation is essential to obtain high quality surface passivation. In particular, we compare the effect of annealing in forming gas and annealing with a silicon-nitride overlayer as hydrogen source. We present a systematic optimization of the hole-selective contact, for which we varied the doping concentration, annealing parameters and report the implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) and combined specific contact resistivity (ρc). It is observed that for highly doped layers the optimum annealing temperature for high quality surface passivation is 800°C while for lowly doped layers the optimum annealing condition shifts to 850°C. Excellent surface passivation and efficient current transport is evidenced by an iVoc value of 718mV which corresponds to a saturation current density (J0) of 11.5fA/cm2 and a ρc of 17mΩcm2 on p−type wafers. Moreover, the evolution of the boron diffusion profiles with different annealing conditions is investigated. Finally, we demonstrate proof-of-concept p−type hybrid solar cells employing the full-area hole-selective rear contact presented here and standard heterojunction front electron contact. The excellent efficiency potential of our passivating rear contact is highlighted by conversion efficiencies up to of 21.9%, enabling Voc of 708mV, FF of 79.9% and Jsc of 38.7mA/cm2.

Abstract: Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare (1:1million), hereditary bleeding disorder caused by defects of the platelet GPIb-IX-V complex. Patients suffer from mucocutaneous bleedings. Typical are thrombocytopenia, giant platelets and impaired agglutination after stimulation with ristocetin. In populations in which consanguineous marriages are common the frequency of the disorder is increased because Bernard-Soulier syndrome is mostly inherited autosomal recessively. Genetic analyses of the disease-related genes may help to gain more insights regarding the phenotype/genotype correlation. Here, we investigated several patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome from different families. We analyzed two patients with severe bleeding symptoms from one family of middle east origin and confirmed the diagnosis by identifying a pathogenic variant in GP1BB. We compared phenotype/genotype correlation of this GP1BB mutation with the GP9 (p.Asn61Ser) European founder mutation present in 9 patients out of 4 families for whom we also performed molecular genetic analysis.

Abstract: For application in space environments, the effect of 1-MeV electron irradiation on wafer-bonded GaInP/GaAs//InGaAsP/InGaAs four-junction solar cell grown by all solid state molecular beam epitaxy was studied. After exposure to 1-MeV electron irradiation at 1×15 e/cm2, an end of life remaining factor of approximately 85% was obtained. The wafer bonding interface was studied by spectral response and transmission electron microscopy. 1-MeV electron irradiation was conducted on the individual InGaAsP and InGaAs single junction cell, respectively. The degradation of the four-junction cell was mainly due to damage on the InGaAsP and InGaAs subcells rather than the bonding interface.

Impact of high cholesterol in a Parkinson’s disease model: Prevention of lysosomal leakage versus stimulation of α-synuclein aggregation,

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease is characterized by accumulation of intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, Lewy bodies, which mainly consist of aggregated α-synuclein. Controversies exist as to whether high blood cholesterol is a risk factor for the development of the disease and whether statin treatment could have a protective effect. Using a model system of BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), we found that MPP+-induced cell death was accompanied by cholesterol accumulation in a lysosomal-like pattern in pre-apoptotic cells. To study the effects of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, we increased lysosomal cholesterol through pre-treatment with U18666A and found delayed leakage of lysosomal contents into the cytosol, which reduced cell death. This suggests that increased lysosomal cholesterol is a stress response mechanism to protect lysosomal membrane integrity in response to early apoptotic stress. However, high cholesterol also stimulated the accumulation of α-synuclein. Treatment with the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin reduced MPP+-induced cell death by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species, but did not prevent lysosomal cholesterol increase nor affect α-synuclein accumulation. Our study indicates a dual role of high cholesterol in Parkinson’s disease, in which it acts both as a protector against lysosomal membrane permeabilization and as a stimulator of α-synuclein accumulation.

Abstract: Stainless steel 316, duplex steel 2205 and carbon steel 1008 were examined for compatibility with the eutectic mixtures of NaCl+Na2CO3 at 700°C and Li2CO3 + K2CO3 + Na2CO3 at 450°C in air for thermal energy storage. Electrochemical measurements combined with advanced microscopy and microanalysis techniques were employed. Oxidation was found as the primary attack in both molten salt environments. However, the availability of O2 controlled the degree of oxidation. Alloy 316 showed the lowest corrosion current densities in each molten salt owing to the formation of films on the surface. The attack morphology on the surface of all materials was uniform corrosion with no localized degradation at 450°C. Microscopy observations showed grain boundary oxidative attack as the primary corrosion mechanism for all studied alloys at 700°C with depletion of alloying elements from grain boundaries in alloys 316 and 2205. The protective nature of austenite phase reduced selective oxidation of the underlying ferrite layers of alloy 2205 in chloride carbonate at 700°C.

Abstract: Background
GNPAT p.D519G positivity is significantly increased in HFE p.C282Y homozygotes with markedly increased iron stores. We sought to determine associations of p.D519G and iron-related variables with iron stores in p.C282Y homozygotes.
Methods
We defined markedly increased iron stores as serum ferritin >2247pmol/L (>1000μg/L) and either hepatic iron >236μmol/g dry weight or iron >10g by induction phlebotomy (men and women). We defined normal or mildly elevated iron stores as serum ferritin <674.1pmol/L (<300μg/L) or either age≥40y with iron ≤2.5g iron by induction phlebotomy or age≥50y with ≤3.0g iron by induction phlebotomy (men only). We compared participant subgroups using univariate methods. Using multivariable logistic regression, we evaluated associations of markedly increased iron stores with these variables: age; iron supplement use (dichotomous); whole blood units donated; erythrocyte units received as transfusion; daily alcohol consumption, g; and p.D519G positivity (heterozygosity or homozygosity).
Results
The mean age of 56 participants (94.6% men) was 55±10 (SD) y; 41 had markedly increased iron stores. Prevalences of swollen/tender 2nd/3rd metacarpophalangeal joints and elevated aspartate or alanine aminotransferase were significantly greater in participants with markedly increased iron stores. Only participants with markedly increased iron stores had cirrhosis. In multivariable analyses, p.D519G positivity was the only exposure variable significantly associated with markedly increased iron stores (odds ratio 9.9, 95% CI [1.6, 60.3], p=0.0126).
Conclusions
GNPAT p.D519G is strongly associated with markedly increased iron stores in p.C282Y homozygotes after correction for age, iron-related variables, and alcohol consumption.

Abstract: Proprotein convertases (PCs) are involved in various physiological and pathological processes ranging from embryogenesis to carcinogenesis. Here, using the zebrafish fin regeneration model, we report induced expression of furin and PC5 but not PACE4 and PC7 during fin regeneration that is associated with increased PC activity. Stabilization of HIF by cobalt chloride (CoCl2) further increases these processes. The use of the general PC-inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-cholromethyl ketone (CMK) inhibited control and CoCl2-induced PC activity. CoCl2 inhibits embryonic zebrafish ZF4 cell proliferation and caudal fin regeneration that is associated with the expression of the anti-proliferative genes P21, P16, PC3 and P53 in ZF4 cells and in non-regenerating stump tissues. In contrast, during fin regeneration, HIF stabilization failed to promote the expression of these anti-proliferative genes and maintained high expression of cyclin D. Further analysis revealed that CoCl2 maintained the formation of immature regenerating vasculature that was associated with amplified expression of OCT4 and various angiogenic factors reported to be PC substrates and/or downstream effectors. These findings revealed that while furin and PC5 expression/activity and their substrates/effectors are regulated during fin regeneration, HIF stabilization by CoCl2 has the potential to modulate these processes and impact on the regenerative process and vessels organization.

Abstract: The graft processing facility forms one of the core components of a clinical haematopoietic stem cell transplant program. The quality of a graft is instrumental in leading to consistent and reproducible outcomes of engraftment and other parameters. As such, meticulous planning and consideration is required and will include core elements including physical design and clinical correlates. The successful running of such a facility depends on an overarching quality program and adherence to local and international regulatory guidelines.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest expanded graphite (EG) can significantly enhance the thermal conductivity, stability, efficiency of phase change material (PCM). This study aims to investigate the thermal-physical properties of the LiNO3-KCl-NaNO3/expanded graphite composite PCM. The testing PCM samples were prepared using the Capillary Method with 5wt%, 10wt%, 15wt%, 20wt%, 25wt% EG. When EG mass fraction is 25wt%, no leakage was observed in the leakage test. The SEM image shows that the EG had intense absorption ability to the LiNO3-KCl-NaNO3 composites. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) comparison between the pure salt and the composite PCM suggests that no new substance produced after adding the EG into the eutectic LiNO3-KCl-NaNO3. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of the composite PCM indicate that the latent heat was reduced dramatically when the EG and the eutectic LiNO3-KCl-NaNO3 were blended together. In the experiment, thermal conductivity and the compress density of the composite PCM show a strongly linear relationship. Also, the thermal conductivity of the PCM can be enhanced after adding the EG into the pure salt. Finally, the thermal performance of the latent heat system using the eutectic LiNO3-KCl-NaNO3 and the composite PCM were compared. Due to the high thermal conductivity, the charging rate of the system utilizing the composite PCM is much faster than the pure salt.

Ccdc181 is a microtubule-binding protein that interacts with Hook1 in haploid male germ cells and localizes to the sperm tail and motile cilia,

Abstract: Disruption of murine Hook1 results in a disturbed spermatogenesis and consequently leads to male infertility in mice. Within these mice abnormal sperm development starts with a disorganization of the microtubular manchette in elongating spermatids that leads to an abnormal head shape as well as to distinctive structural changes in the flagella of the sperm. To elucidate Hook1 function in male germ cell differentiation a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a murine testicular library, which leads to the identification of several putative Hook1 interacting proteins. One of the isolated cDNA fragments encodes for the coiled-coil domain containing protein 181 (Ccdc181). The putative interaction of Ccdc181 with Hook1 was verified by FRET analysis and interacting regions were identified using yeast two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, Ccdc181 seems to interact directly with microtubules and localizes to the microtubular manchette of elongating spermatids, resembling the previously reported localization of Hook1. According to the observed immunostaining pattern the RNA expression of Ccdc181 is less prominent in pre-meiotic stages of sperm development but increases in the haploid phase of spermatogenesis and seems to be restricted to male germ cells. However, Ccdc181 expression is also observed to a lower extent in somatic tissues, particularly, in tissues containing ciliated epithelia. Additionally, Ccdc181 protein is found to localize to the sperm flagella and to the basal half of motile cilia, whereas Ccdc181 was not detected in primary non-motile cilia. Furthermore, we showed that Ccdc181 is a putative interacting partner of the different catalytic subunits of Pp1, raising the hypothesis that Ccdc181 plays a role in mediating ciliary motility.

Abstract: Directed migration of leukocytes towards a chemotactic source is largely dependent on coordinated actin cytoskeleton functions that provide the driving forces at the cell front and enable contractility at the rear. In contrast to the force-generating properties of the actin cytoskeleton, the microtubule network assumes a regulatory function in balancing front-to-back polarity. In migrating neutrophils, microtubules are mostly concentrated at the cell rear, and previously published work suggested that microtubules are stabilized and kept in place by a mechanism involving Cdc42, WASP, CD11b, and the end-binding protein 1 (EB1). EB1, as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein (+TIP), is a potential candidate to bridge the gap between microtubule and actomyosin dynamics. After knockdown of EB1 in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, both directionality and straightness of migration while moving through 3D collagen gels are impaired. An increased number of lateral protrusions are observed in EB1-knockdown cells, indicating an inability to balance cell polarity in the absence of EB1. Moreover, in EB1-deficient cells, substrate adhesion on fibrinogen-coated surfaces is significantly reduced. EB1-knockdown cells show significant changes in levels of GEF-H1, a microtubule-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor that links microtubule integrity to RhoA-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that GEF-H1 might constitute one element of the microtubule-actin crosstalk in migrating leukocytes.

Abstract: The JAK2V617F mutation that results in a hyper-activation of the JAK2 kinase in the erythropoietin pathway is a molecular marker for myeloproliferative neoplasms. Using allele-specific Real-Time PCR, we detected the mutation in the blood of 17.3% (17/98) of normal donors; the mutant allele burden was, however, very low (<0.01% compared to >1% in polycythemia vera). It was much higher in differentiated blood cells in the peripheral blood than in undifferentiated CD34+ cells. Erythropoietin-stimulated differentiation of normal CD34+ cells in liquid culture increased the mutation frequency by 3.34-fold. When progenitors from 9 normal donors were grown in erythropoietin-stimulated semi-solid cultures, the mutation was found in 8.69% of the colonies, but only in <3% of the JAK2 alleles in each positive colony, suggesting that the mutation occurred only in a few cells per colony. In mouse erythroleukemia cells carrying human JAK2 DNA, wild-type or JAK2V617F, the frequencies of mutations from JAK2 wild-type to JAK2V617F and vice versa increased following erythroid differentiation. These results suggest that the mutation occurs and accumulates during differentiation. We hypothesize that genetic stability, which relies on DNA repair, is efficient in normal hematopoietic stem cells but is downgraded in differentiating cells, rendering them susceptible to mutations, including JAK2V617F.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia is accompanied by an accelerated formation rate of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetic neuronal deficits. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) belongs to a family of ligand-activated nuclear receptors and its ligands are known to control many physiological, pathological and inflammatory pathways. Weinvestigated the hypothesis that the PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone) would abrogate AGEs-mediated neurotoxic effects on human neural stem cells (hNSCs), by whichAGEs may play a role in diabetic-related neuronal impairment. Here, we show that rosiglitazone treatment increases cell viability of hNSCs via downregulation of caspase 3 activity. These rescue effects were extended in our studies showingrosiglitazone-mediated activation of PPARγ reversed the expression levels of two neuroprotective factors (Bcl-2 and PGC1α) that were downregulated in hNSCs exposed to AGEs alone. The stimulation of mitochondrial function and anti-oxidative stress by rosiglitazone was associated with activation of the PGC1α pathway by up-regulation of mitochondrial (NRF-1 and Tfam) and oxidative defense (SOD1, SOD2 and Gpx1) genes. Moreover, rosiglitazone significantly normalized the inflammatory responses (TNF-α and IL-1β), NF-κB (p65), and inflammatory genes (iNOS and COX-2) in the hNSCs treated with AGEs. This neuroprotective effect of rosiglitazone was effectively blocked by PPARγ-specific antagonist (GW9662), demonstrating that the action of rosiglitazone was mediated by at PPARγ-dependent pathway. Collectively, these novel findings show AGEs induce neurotoxic effects in hNSCs, and provide important mechanistic insights that may explain the increased risk of neuronal impairment deficits in diabetic patients. More importantly, these data show rosiglitazone-mediated activation of PPARγ-dependent signaling is neuroprotective in AGE-treated hNSCs, and suggests PPARγ ligands may be useful in the therapeutic management of patients with neurodegenerative diseases

Abstract: Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) has been implicated in human cancers, but its role and clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. Here, we show that HMGCS2 is downregulated and exhibits antimetastatic potential in HCC. Low expression of HMGCS2 was associated with poor tumor differentiation, vascular invasion and worse overall and disease-free survivals in two independent cohorts consisting of 743 cases. In vitro data demonstrated HMGCS2 overexpression suppressed, whereas HMGCS2 silence promoted HCC cell migration via Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process and the activation of ERK/c-Jun signaling pathway. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PD098059 markedly attenuated the malignant phenotypes mediated by HMGCS2 siRNA. Furthermore, miR-107 was identified as an upstream regulator of HMGCS2 via directly targeting the 3′-UTR of HMGCS2 mRNA. Collectively, our findings suggest HMGCS2 serve as a promising prognostic biomarker and exert anti-tumor activity towards HCC, and therefore provide a potential target for HCC clinical intervention.

Abstract: Protecting from solar radiation remains a very stimulating field of research and development. Improvement of performances of UV/IR radiation shielding devices is thus constantly pursued. With increase of computer strength and code efficiency, simulation becomes a real asset in this investigation. In this study, we report an efficient multiscale simulation protocol to design and optimize such photonic devices based on polymers. The simulation approach combines atomistic-level techniques, i.e. classical molecular mechanics, and linear scaling-DFT in order to get full description of the optical properties of polymers over a large wavelength range. At each step of the procedure, validation with experimental data is carried out, confirming the accuracy of the approach. The resulting optical constants enable designing of a multilayer photonic heterostructure purposely optimized for UV/NIR-radiations protection. The ensuing simulated device reveals very promising optical performance. It exhibits a transparency higher than 90% in the visible range and shows high UV absorptance. Moreover, a strong NIR-shielding ability of 96% is achieved.

Compared to our previous record efficiency (26.3%), the 0.3% absolute improvement can be regarded as ~10% reduction of remaining losses to the theoretical limit (~ 29%). We discuss the analyzed cell properties together with our recent progress to predict how far we can go in reducing the remaining losses in silicon photovoltaic.

Abstract: The major histocompatibility complex is linked to white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts in subjects unselected for HFE genotypes. We compared age, sex, body mass index, total WBC and subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) (Beckman Coulter® Gen-S), transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin of HFE p.C282Y and wild-type (p.C282Y, p.H63D negative) homozygotes without acquired conditions that influence WBC counts. We performed regressions on WBC and subtypes. There were 161 p.C282Y homozygotes (45.3% men) and 221 wild-type homozygotes (40.3% men). Mean WBC of men and women and between HFE genotypes were similar. Mean lymphocytes were higher in male p.C282Y homozygotes: 1.6×109/L [95% confidence interval: 1.5,1.7] vs. 1.4 [1.3,1.5], p=0.0002. Mean lymphocytes and basophils were higher in female p.C282Y homozygotes: 1.6 [1.5,1.7] vs. 1.4 [1.3,1.5], p=0.0002; and 0.065 [0.059,0.071] vs. 0.052 [0.051,0.054], p=0.0001, respectively. Transferrin saturation was associated with neutrophils (negative; p=0.0163). Age was associated with lymphocytes (negative; p=0.0003) and monocytes (positive; p<0.0001). Regressions on lymphocytes and basophils revealed positive associations with p.C282Y homozygosity (p=0.0043 and 0.0003, respectively). There were significant positive associations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. We conclude that HFE p.C282Y homozygosity is significantly associated with lymphocyte and basophil counts.

Abstract: Bifacial semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are highly attractive for improving the efficiency of tandem solar cells and extending bifacial photovoltaic applications. However, the further improvement of bifacial performance has always been limited by the semitransparent electrode. Here we report an efficient triple-layer cathode of polyethyleneimine ethoxylate/silver/molybdenum oxide (PEIE/Ag/MoOx) for hysteresis-free planar PSCs with an inverted device configuration. Firstly, the optimal thickness of Ag electrode (11nm) is achieved by theoretical calculation, and the fabricated PSC achieves the PCE of 8.04% at indium-tin-oxide (ITO) side and 5.24% at Ag film side. Then, by introducing the MoOx (10nm) optical coupling layer and PEIE (10nm) interfacial modifying layer, the resulted PSC shows an obviously increased PCEs of 13.55% (ITO side) and 8.41% (Ag side), which is 60% higher than that of Ag only PSCs. The optimized PSCs has a structure of Glass/ITO/Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/Methylammonium-Lead-Iodide (about 300nm)/Phenyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester/PEIE/Ag/MoOx. It is thought that the enhanced Ag film transmittance by high-refractive-index MoOx and electron extraction ability by low-work-function PEIE contribute to the improved cathode property and bifacial PSC performance. Moreover, when a back-reflector is employed, the PCE of device could be further improved to 14.50% (ITO side) and 11.37% (Ag side).

Abstract: Thrombotic complications are increasing at a steady and significant rate in children resulting in the more widespread use of anticoagulation in this population. Anticoagulant drugs in children can be divided into the standard agents (heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists) and alternative agents (argatroban, bivalirudin, and fondaparinux). This review will compare and contrast the standard and alternative anticoagulants and suggest situations in which it may be appropriate to use argatroban, bivalirudin, and fondaparinux. Clearly, the standard anticoagulants all have significant shortcomings including variable pharmacokinetics, issues with therapeutic drug monitoring, frequency of administration, efficacy, and adverse effects. The alternative anticoagulants have properties which overcome these shortcomings and prospective clinical trial data are presented supporting the current and future use of these agents in place of the standard anticoagulants.

Abstract: Background
To better understand self-reported health-related quality-of-life (HrQoL) in children and adults with chronic hemostatic conditions compared with healthy controls.
Methods/patients/results
Group 1 consisted of 74 children/adolescents aged 8–18years with hereditary bleeding disorders (H-BD), 12 siblings and 34 peers. Group 2 consisted of 82 adult patients with hereditary/acquired bleeding disorders (H/A-BD), and group 3 of 198 patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) on anticoagulant therapy. Adult patients were compared to 1011 healthy blood donors. HrQoL was assessed with a ‘revised KINDer Lebensqualitaetsfragebogen’ (KINDL-R)-questionnaire adapted to adolescents and adults. No differences were found in multivariate analyses of self-reported HrQoL in children with H-BD. In contrast, apart from family and school-/work-related wellbeing in female patients with DVT the adult patients showed significantly lower HrQoL sub-dimensions compared to heathy control subjects. Furthermore, adults with H/A-BD disorders reported better friend-related HrQoL compared to patients with DVT, mainly due to a decreased HrQoL subscale in women on anticoagulation.
Conclusion
In children with H-BD, HrQoL was comparable to siblings and peers. In adults with H/A-BD HrQoL was comparable to patients with DVT while healthy blood donors showed better HrQoL. The friend-related HrQoL subscale was significantly reduced in female compared to male patients.

Abstract: Previously, we demonstrated that P-3F, a podophyllum derivative, exhibits a 297-fold enhancement in antitumor activity than VP-16, used as anticancer agent in clinical. The purpose of our present study was to investigate the precise antitumor mechanism action of P-3F. It showed that P-3F inhibited microtubule polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner. The results were in overall agreement with modeling and docking studies performed on P-3F and tubulin. In addition, P-3F increased the levels of P53, this in turn prolonged P53 half-life. Note as well that levels of P21 protein were increased along with P53 in a concentration dependent change. It suggested that enhancement in stabilization of P53 induced by P-3F may be critical for P53/P21 signaling pathway, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G2/M. Furthermore, release of RPS27a from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm led to decrease phosphorylation of Mdm2 at serine residue 166 and inhibit Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of P53 in (P-3F)-treated HeLa cells. Together, these data suggest that P-3F, a microtubule polymerization inhibitor, causes P53 accumulation via P53 stability enhancement, due to blockage of the P53-Mdm2 network through the change in localization of RPS27a.

Abstract: Background
Coumarins occurs naturally across plant kingdoms exhibits significant pharmacological properties and pharmacokinetic activity. The conventional, therapeutic agents are often associated with poor stability, absorption and increased side effects. Therefore, identification of a drug that has little or no-side effect on humans is consequential. Here, we investigated the antiproliferative activity of styrene substituted biscoumarin against various human breast cancer cell lines, such as MCF-7, (ER-) MDA-MB-231 and (AR+) MDA-MB-453. Styrene substituted biscoumarin induced cell death by apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cell line was analyzed.
Methods
Antiproliferative activity of Styrene substituted biscoumarin was performed by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Styrene substituted biscoumarin induced apoptosis was assessed by Hoechst staining, Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (Annexin V-FITC/PI) staining and flow cytometric analysis. Migratory and proliferating characteristic of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was also analyzed by wound healing and colony formation assay. Furthermore, mRNA expression of BAX and BCL-2 were quantified using qRT-PCR and protein expression level analyzed by Western blot.
Results
The inhibition concentration (IC50) of styrene substituted biscoumarin was assayed against three breast cancer cell lines. The inhibition concentration (IC50) value of styrene substituted biscoumarin toward MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cell lines was 5.63, 7.30 and 10.84μg/ml respectively. Styrene substituted biscoumarin induced apoptosis was detected by Hoechst staining, DAPI/PI analysis and flow-cytometric analysis. The migration and proliferative efficiency of MDA-MB-231 cells were completely arrested upon styrene substituted biscoumarin treatment. Also, mRNA gene expression and protein expression of pro-apoptotic (BAX) and anti-apoptotic (BCL-2) genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis upon styrene substituted biscoumarin treatment to MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results showed that styrene substituted biscoumarin downregulated BCL-2 gene expression and upregulated BAX gene expression to trigger apoptotic process.
Conclusion
Styrene substituted biscoumarin could induce apoptosis through intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in breast cancer cell lines, particularly in MDA-MB-231. Our data suggest that styrene substituted biscoumarin may act as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against breast cancer.

Abstract: Glutathione (gamma-glutamylcysteinylglycine) has diverse functions including free radicals scavenging and modulating many critical cellular processes. Glutathione is synthesized by the consecutive action of the enzymes glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthetase. GCL is composed of a catalytic subunit encoded by the GCLC gene and a regulatory subunit encoded by the GCLM gene. GCL deficiency due to homozygous mutations in GCLC has been reported in 6 individuals from 4 independent families. All presented with hemolytic anemia and 4 had additional neurological manifestations including cognitive impairment, neuropathy, ataxia, and myopathy. In this report, we present additional 6 children from 2 independent consanguineous families with GCL deficiency. All the children presented with neonatal hemolytic anemia. Beyond the neonatal period, they did not have jaundice or hemolysis, but continued to have mild anemia. They all had normal development and neurological examination. The affected children from the first family had the homozygous mutation c.1772G>A (p.S591N) and the second family had the homozygous mutation c.514T>A (p.S172T) in GCLC. GCL deficiency can have a mild non-neurological phenotype or a more severe phenotype with neurological manifestations. GCL deficiency can be an underdiagnosed cause of hemolytic anemia, thus awareness may aid in early diagnosis, appropriate genetic counseling, and management.

Abstract: We have introduced centrifugally-cast thin-film formation technique to 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) formed through a liquid based exfoliation method. The film-formation technique has evidenced a growth of uniform and homogeneous thin-films of single or a-few-layered MoS2; the thin-films have been introduced as a charge-transport layer in perovskite solar cells. From scanning tunneling spectroscopy and thereof the density of states of the 2D semiconductor, we have observed that the band-edges of MoS2 formed a type-II band-alignment with the commonly-used organic-inorganic lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite when the 2D material was subjected to an ozone-treatment. We thereafter formed p–i–n heterojunction planar perovskite solar cells with the thin-film of 2H-MoS2 so that charge separation can occur at the MoS2|perovskite interface. In this work, we also report device characteristics and impedance spectroscopy of the heterojunctions, which were optimized for a small series-resistance and a large shunt-resistance.

Selectivity of coronaridine congeners at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inhibitory activity on mouse medial habenula,

Abstract: The inhibitory activity of coronaridine congeners on human (h) α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) is determined by Ca2+ influx assays, whereas their effects on neurons in the ventral inferior (VI) aspect of the mouse medial habenula (MHb) are determined by patch-clamp recordings. The Ca2+ influx results clearly establish that coronaridine congeners inhibit hα3β4 AChRs with higher selectivity compared to hα4β2 and hα7 subtypes, and with the following potency sequence, for hα4β2: (±)-18-methoxycoronaridine [(±)-18-MC]>(+)-catharanthine>(±)-18-methylaminocoronaridine [(±)-18-MAC] ∼ (±)-18-hydroxycoronaridine [(±)-18-HC]; and for hα7: (+)-catharanthine>(±)-18-MC>(±)-18-HC>(±)-18-MAC. Interestingly, the inhibitory potency of (+)-catharanthine (27±4μM) and (±)-18-MC (28±6μM) on MHb (VI) neurons was lower than that observed on hα3β4 AChRs, suggesting that these compounds inhibit a variety of endogenous α3β4* AChRs. In addition, the interaction of bupropion with (−)-ibogaine sites on hα3β4 AChRs is tested by [3H]ibogaine competition binding experiments. The results indicate that bupropion binds to ibogaine sites at desensitized hα3β4 AChRs with 2-fold higher affinity than at resting receptors, suggesting that these compounds share the same binding sites. In conclusion, coronaridine congeners inhibit hα3β4 AChRs with higher selectivity compared to other AChRs, by interacting with the bupropion (luminal) site. Coronaridine congeners also inhibit α3β4*AChRs expressed in MHb (VI) neurons, supporting the notion that these receptors are important endogenous targets for their anti-addictive activities.

Abstract: Muscle atrophy occurs when there is a net loss of muscle mass, leading to a change in the balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation. Igf1 is important for protein synthesis in muscle cells and can induce local skeletal muscle hypertrophy and attenuate age-related skeletal muscle atrophy via the PI3K/Akt pathway in mice, consequently restoring and improving muscle mass and strength. In this study, we show that miR-18a expression is down-regulated during C2C12 myoblast differentiation and mouse tibialis anterior muscle postnatal development. Functional studies show that forced expression of miR-18a induces myotubes atrophy and increases the expression of MuRF1, Atrogin-1 and CTSL. miR-18a also decreases the phosphorylation of both Akt and FoxO3, and an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway blocks the function of miR-18a. An analysis of miR-18a targets reveals that Igf1 is regulated by miR-18a. miR-18a suppresses the expression of Igf1 in a 3′UTR-dependent manner. These findings strongly support the idea that miR-18a has a functional role in muscle physiology and suggest that miR-18a is a potential novel therapeutic target for skeletal muscle atrophy.

Abstract: Decreased erythrocyte deformability, as measured by ektacytometry, may be associated with disease severity in sickle cell anemia (SCA). Heterogeneous populations of rigid and deformable cells in SCA blood result in distortions of diffraction pattern measurements that correlate with the concentration of hemoglobin S (HbS) and the percentage of irreversibly sickled cells. We hypothesize that red cell heterogeneity, as well as deformability, will also be influenced by the concentration of alternative hemoglobins such as fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and the adult variant, HbA2. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the relationship between diffraction pattern distortion, osmotic gradient ektacytometry parameters, and the hemoglobin composition of SCA blood. We observe a correlation between the extent of diffraction pattern distortions and percentage of HbF and HbA2. Osmotic gradient ektacytometry data indicate that minimum elongation in the hypotonic region is positively correlated with HbF, as is the osmolality at which it occurs. The osmolality at both minimum and maximum elongation is inversely correlated with HbS and HbA2. These data suggest that HbF may effectively improve surface-to-volume ratio and osmotic fragility in SCA erythrocytes. HbA2 may be relatively ineffective in improving these characteristics or cellular hydration at the levels found in this patient cohort.

Abstract: Paraffin wax-graphite foam (P-wax/G-foam) composite was fabricated by using low cost small scale process aiming to produce a stable phase change material with enhanced thermal transport. Its thermophysical properties such as thermal diffusivity, specific heat and thermal conductivity were examined as a function of temperature. The thermal conductivity of the P-wax/G-foam composite in both solid (2.6W/mK) and liquid (1.8W/mK) phases is by a factor of ≈ 11 (980%) higher than that of pristine paraffin wax in solid (0.24W/mK) and by a factor of ≈ 16 (1530%) in liquid (0.11W/mK) phases, respectively. This is due to both the G-foam morphology and graphitic content, allowing a rapid heat transfer to the P-wax. The thermal conductivity behaviour of the composite is also discussed in term of a theoretical model in which the G-foam is described by a 3D interpenetrating matrix for the P-wax. The model shows the self-consistency of all the measured data. The obtained results demonstrated that the stable P-wax/G-foam composite is a promising material for various thermal energy storage applications such as building and vehicle heating and cooling, solar thermal harvesting, and thermal management of electrochemical energy storage and electronic devices.

Abstract: Invasive procedures in children are in most cases elective and are carried out in otherwise healthy children. While many surgeries are still performed in a hospital, more and more procedures are defined as “outpatient procedures,” leading to increased discussion about safety and risks. This review will examine common practices, review the sparse literature and provide recommendations regarding the identification of children with increased bleeding risk, planning for children with known bleeding disorders and strategies for perioperative management. In conclusion, after careful planning, surgeries can be performed safely even in children with known bleeding disorders.

Abstract: Recent studies on erythrocyte membrane fluctuations revealed that the erythrocyte cytoskeleton actively modulates its membrane association thereby regulating crucial membrane properties. Cationic amphiphilic drugs like chlorpromazine are known to induce a cup-like cell shape and vesicle formation into the cell interior, effectors of this process, however, are largely unknown. Using flow cytometry, this study explored conditions that influence endovesiculation induced by chlorpromazine. We found that inhibitors of membrane fluctuations, like ATP depletion, vanadate or fluoride, also inhibited endovesiculation whereas activation of PKC, known to decrease cytoskeleton association and increase membrane fluctuations, also enhanced endovesicle formation. This indicates that endovesicle formation and membrane fluctuations are modulated by the same cytoskeleton-regulated membrane properties. Further, acanthocytic erythrocytes of chorea acanthocytosis (ChAc) patients that lack the VPS13A/chorein protein - likely a crucial organizer at the erythrocyte cytoskeleton/membrane interface - showed a strong decrease in chlorpromazine-induced endovesiculation. The responses of ChAc erythrocytes to effectors of endovesiculation were similar to that of control erythrocytes, yet at drastically reduced levels. This suggests a more rigid and less dynamic interaction at the membrane-cytoskeleton interphase of ChAc erythrocytes.

Abstract: The folding of tRNA fragments (tRFs) into G-quadruplex structures and the implications of G-quadruplexes in translational inhibition have been studied mainly in mammalian systems. To increase our knowledge of these phenomena, we determined the influence of human and plant tRFs and model G-quadruplexes on translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and wheat germ extract. The efficiency of translational inhibition in the mammalian system was strongly associated with the type of G-quadruplex topology. In the plant system, the ability of a small RNA to adopt the G-quadruplex conformation was not sufficient to repress translation, indicating the importance of other structural determinants.

Abstract: α-thalassemia is a common disease characterized mainly by deletion mutants. We identified two new α-thalassemia pointform mutants: α1cod22 GGC>GGT Gly>Gly creating a 5′ splicing sequence and α1cod23 GAG>TAG Glu>stop. We performed qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of the mRNA molecules, from carriers’ blood, to define the molecular mechanisms giving rise to the thalassemia phenotype. In vitro analysis using α-globin constructs and cycloheximide was performed to evaluate if the mutants are substrates of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In the α1cod22 GGC>GGT the new 5′ splicing site in exon 1 completely substitutes the normal one. We demonstrated the presence of mRNA decay as the abnormally spliced mRNA was consistent in the nucleus, partially degraded in the cytoplasm of cultured cells, but only 2.8% in the reticulocytes. The analysis of the αcod23 transcript showed an escape from the NMD as for the human β-globin transcript with nonsense mutations in the first exon: the anomalous mRNA was reduced in the nucleus, followed by only a slight lowering from 32% to 27% of the normal α1 mRNA in the reticulocytes. In both the mutants we showed a moderate sensitivity to the NMD assay and we speculate the activation of other RNA surveillance mechanisms for the αcod22 mutant. No activation of cryptic splice sites was detected and no role could be assigned to the nonsense-associated altered splicing. Studies on transcripts from patient cells represent a very useful approach providing considerable information about the processes occuring in vivo.

Abstract: The field of single-cell sequencing is fleetly expanding, and many techniques have been developed in the past decade. With this technology, biologists can study not only the heterogeneity between two adjacent cells in the same tissue or organ, but also the evolutionary relationships and degenerative processes in a single cell. Calling variants is the main purpose in analyzing single cell sequencing (SCS) data. Currently, some popular methods used for bulk-cell-sequencing data analysis are tailored directly to be applied in dealing with SCS data. However, SCS requires an extra step of genome amplification to accumulate enough quantity for satisfying sequencing needs. The amplification yields large biases and thus raises challenge for using the bulk-cell-sequencing methods. In order to provide guidance for the development of specialized analyzed methods as well as using currently developed tools for SNS, this paper aims to bridge the gap. In this paper, we firstly introduced two popular genome amplification methods and compared their capabilities. Then we introduced a few popular models for calling single-nucleotide polymorphisms and copy-number variations. Finally, break-through applications of SNS were summarized to demonstrate its potential in researching cell evolution.

Abstract: All patients with HbSS (SCA) share the same genetic mutation but the clinical phenotype is variable and difficult to predict early in life. A reliable severity predictor would be invaluable toward directing therapeutic decisions in those patients at highest risk of SCA complications. A search of PubMed, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, and Scopus was performed to determine which SCA severity predictors have been validated in pediatric patients. The full text of 94 of the 590 references identified was reviewed based on the title/abstract. Fifty-four articles were included in the analysis. Alpha globin gene number was the most commonly studied severity predictor, followed by fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and reticulocyte count. Alpha thalassemia trait was protective against overt stroke and abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) in all but one study, but not frequency of painful crisis or silent cerebral infarct. Two thirds of the HbF studies reported beneficial effects with increasing HbF levels; however, increased HbF levels were not associated with lower hospitalization or stroke rates in others. The ability to predict SCA complications was mixed for all variables, except TCD and absolute reticulocyte count. More reliable predictors are urgently needed to guide therapeutic decisions in children with SCA.

Abstract: Owing to its excellent optical, electronic properties, good chemical and thermal stability, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been applied in promising energy technologies including new dye-sensitized solar cells, rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, photocatalysts and gas sensors in recent years. However, wide band gap and poor electron transporting ability of TiO2 has largely limited its application in some aspects like photocatalytic hydrogen generation and lithium ion batteries. Therefore, the modification of TiO2 is essential for improving its optical and electrical properties. Graphene (GR), a two dimensional carbon nanostructure, is an ideal material to modify TiO2 owing to its excellent electronic transport properties, exceptional thermal, and electrical conductivity. Compared to a pure TiO2 nanostructure, the conjugation of GR leads to the increase of its adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity, and improve the electrical conductivity and Li-ion diffusion pathways. In this review, we have firstly discussed pure TiO2 nanostructures and introduced different methods for the preparation of TiO2-graphene nanohybrids (TiO2-GRNHs), and then discussed the practical applications of the TiO2-GRNHs in different energy technologies. It is expected that the continuous breakthroughs in the synthesis and modifications of TiO2-GRNHs will bring new high-performance materials with exotic properties and potential applications in emerging energy technologies.

Abstract: A single junction gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cell on silicon (Si) substrate with energy conversion efficiency of 11.88% under the AM1.5G spectrum at 1 sun intensity without an anti-reflection coating (ARC) has been developed. This development was enabled by utilizing an intermediate, thin arsenic-doped germanium (As-doped Ge) buffer layer. The thin epitaxial Ge layer (< 2µm) grown on the Si substrate created a virtual Ge-on-Si (Ge/Si) substrate for subsequent growth of the GaAs solar cell, providing low threading dislocation density (TDD) of < 5 × 106cm−2. The energy conversion efficiency could be further improved to 16% upon optimizing the ARC and metal coverage. Hence, a manufacturable III-V photovoltaic on a large-area Si substrate has become possible.

Abstract: Several developing solar cell technologies—including perovskite cells, thin-film cells, epitaxially grown cells, and many tandem cells on silicon—have fabrication constraints that require a planar front surface. However, flat front surfaces result in large reflection losses and poor light trapping within the cell. We investigate scattering layers made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer carrying a random-pyramid texture to reduce such losses. The layers are first tested on a model system consisting of silicon heterojunction solar cells that have zero, one, or two surfaces textured with the same random pyramids (the other surfaces being planar) in order to elucidate the potential and limitations of employing a textured transparent layer instead of a textured absorber. PDMS layers result in short-circuit current density enhancements of 3.0mA/cm2 and 1.7mA/cm2 when applied to the front of a cell with flat front and rear surfaces, and a cell with a flat front surface and textured rear surface, respectively. Optical simulations reveal that the majority of the gain is due to a reduction in front-surface reflection and that the layers contribute only marginally to trapping weakly absorbed infrared light; nevertheless, a cell with a textured rear surface and a PDMS layer at its flat front surface can come to within 0.7mA/cm2 of the performance of a double-side-textured cell. Finally, a PDMS scattering layer is implemented in a planar perovskite solar cell, boosting its short-circuit current density by 1.9mA/cm2 and thus its efficiency by 10.6% relative.

Abstract: RNAi-based gene therapy has been recently considered as a promising approach against cancer. Targeted delivery of drug, gene or therapeutic RNAi-based systems to tumor cells is one of the important issues in order to reduce side effects on normal cells. Several strategies have been developed to improve the safety and selectivity of cancer treatments including antibodies, peptides and recently aptamers with various attractive characteristics including higher target specificity, affinity and reduced toxicity. Here we described a novel targeted delivery platform comprising modified PAMAM with 10-bromodecanoic acid (10C) and 10C-PEG for improvement of transfection efficiency, AS1411 aptamer for targeting nucleolin ligand on target cancer cells and shRNA plasmid for specific knockdown of Bcl-xL protein. Modified vector could significantly improve the transfection efficiency even after covalent or non-covalent aptamer binding compared to the non-targeted vector in A549 cells. The results of gene silencing and apoptosis assay indicated that our targeted shRNA delivery system could efficiently down-regulate the Bcl-xL expression up to 25% and induce 14% late apoptosis in target cancer cells with strong cell selectivity. This study proposed a novel targeted non-viral system for shRNA-mediated gene-silencing in cancer cells.

Abstract: Ternary carbonates with a relative low melting point and a high operating temperature is one of the promising heat transfer fluids for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). In the present work, ternary carbonates nanofluids of K2CO3-Li2CO3-Na2CO3 (4:4:2, mass ratio) with nanoparticles were prepared by using a two step solution method. The specific heat capacity of ternary carbonates nanofluids with different nanoparticles (SiO2, CuO, TiO2, Al2O3) or SiO2 with different size (5, 20, 30, 60nm) were investigated. The results show that SiO2 nanoparticles are the most effective additive among of the chosen nanoparticles in enhancing the specific heat capacity of ternary carbonates. The enhancement of specific heat capacity of ternary carbonates is 78.0–116.8% in the range of 500–540°C when adding SiO2 in the range of 5–30nm. The enhancement of specific heat capacity of ternary carbonates nanofluids with CuO, TiO2 and Al2O3 are 50.6–73.9%, 31.1–56.5% and 50.6–66.5% in the range of 500–540°C, respectively. It is proved that there is no chemical reactions between ternary carbonates and the added nanoparticles. The difference in the enhanced specific heat capacity is mainly depended on the dispersive state of nanoparticles and the resulting amount of needle-like nanostructures in ternary carbonates nanofluids.

Abstract: Solar selective absorber coatings, consisting in a TiAlNx / TiAlNy tandem absorber with low (metallic-like) and high (semiconductor-like) nitrogen content, and an Al2O3 antireflective coating, were deposited on stainless steel. A full optical characterization was carried out on these coatings. Reflectance spectra were measured by spectrophotometry in the UV to mid-IR range (0.25−25µm), allowing for the calculation of total solar absorptance and thermal emittance. An absorptance of 0.93 and an emittance of 0.22 at 550°C were obtained for the best coating. The temperature dependence of reflectance was investigated in the infrared region and results demonstrated the validity of the classical room temperature measurement approximation to calculate thermal emittance at high temperature for these coatings. The total hemispherical emittance of the coatings was calculated from hemispherical directional reflectance spectra measured at different angles, showing that the near normal hemispherical emittance is a good approximation of the total hemispherical emittance. The total solar absorptance was also directly measured under natural solar irradiation using a unique solar facility.

Abstract: Background
Most metastatic spinal cord lesions are located either in the intradural, extramedullary, or in the epidural compartments. Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM) is a rare central nervous system spread of cancer. The aim of this report was to evaluate ISCM in the published literature.
Methods
A literature review of PubMed from 1960 to 2016 was undertaken for the publications having demographic, clinical, histological, and outcome data.
Results
A total of 59 relevant papers were identified, showing 128 cases of intramedullary metastasis from lung cancer. The incidence of lung cancer as the primary malignancy with intramedullary metastasis was 56%. The median time from diagnosis of primary to intramedullary metastasis was 6months. Survival improved with multimodality therapy compared to monotherapy (4monthsvs. 6.3months) (hazard ratio=0.501; 95% confidence interval, 0.293–0.857).
Conclusion
Lung cancer is the predominant cause of intramedullary involvement of the spinal cord. Overall prognosis is poor, although a multimodality approach was associated with improved survival.

Abstract: An accurate electrical device characterization of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is an important prerequisite for further improvement and industrial transfer of this promising photovoltaic technology. In this work, we study the nonlinearity of current versus irradiance as well as the temperature dependence of PSCs in a spectrally resolved manner by highly accurate differential external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. We investigate three different types of PSCs fabricated by different research groups. The nonlinearity of all samples is found to be spectrally invariant, which significantly simplifies spectral mismatch corrections. We demonstrate that misinterpretation of EQE measurements can result in a more than 10% relative error in efficiency measurements, if solar simulators are adjusted to photocurrents determined from differential EQEs. For obtaining an accurate integrated photocurrent from EQEs, we introduce a new, convenient approach that accounts for cell nonlinearities but avoids the time-consuming full analysis of spectrally resolved nonlinearity. Moreover, for the samples investigated here, it is shown that the differential EQE measured at 0.35 suns bias irradiance represents a reasonably good estimate of the actual EQE at 1 sun. Furthermore, we determine spectrally resolved temperature coefficients (TCs) and show how the band gap blue shift varies with perovskite absorber and temperature.

Abstract: Absolute values of reference ranges for coagulation assays in humans vary within the entire lifespan and confirm the concept of developmental hemostasis. It is known that physiologic concentrations of coagulation factors (F) gradually increase over age: they are lower in premature infants as compared to full-term babies, healthy children or adults. Here we demonstrate in a cohort of 1011 blood donors and in a group of 193 healthy pregnant women, that the process of developmental hemostasis proceeds in adults. During the course of pregnancy F and activation markers steadily increase until delivery with a parallel decrease noticed for protein S. From adolescents, young adults to the elderly there is a further increase of F, reaching significance starting between 35 and 50years of age compared to younger subjects. Covering the entire lifespan FVIII and von-Willebrand-factor showed the lowest values in carriers of blood group “O”. Apart from pregnancy differences related to gender, pill users, smoking habits or the presence of thrombophilic variants were reported. Laboratory test results should be compared to age-related reference intervals when hemostatic defects are suspected to avoid misclassifications as being “healthy”, prone to “bleeding” or vice versa to “thrombosis”.

Abstract: Severe congenital factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder. Prophylaxis with replacement therapy has been suggested to patients, yet the most beneficial dosing regimens and therapy intervals are still to be defined. Due to the lack of evidence-based data, we hereby present our experience with long-term administration and monitoring primary prophylaxis in children with severe FVII deficiency and an extremely high bleeding risk. Four children with familial FVII deficiency, treated by prophylactic recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), 15–30μg/kg/dose, given 2–3 times weekly since infancy, are discussed. Clinical follow up and monitoring laboratory assays, including thrombin generation, measured at various time points after prophylactic rFVIIa administration are presented. Among our treated patients neither FVII activity nor thrombin generation parameters (both already declined 24h post rFVIIa administration) were able to predict the impact of prophylaxis, and could not be used as surrogate markers in order to assess the most beneficial treatment frequency. However, the long clinical follow-up and comprehensive laboratory assessment performed, have shown that early primary prophylaxis as administered in our cohort was safe and effective.

Abstract: Objective
The level of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4GalT1) is up-regulated in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. It is reported that CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) can enhance the invasiveness of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aims to investigate the specific mechanism of β4GalT1 and relationship between β4GalT1 and CXCR3 in RA.
Methods
The model of CIA mice was established to explore the role of β4GalT1. The N-glycosylation of CXCR3 was detected by mass spectrometry and western-blot. The interaction between β4GalT1 and CXCR3 was tested by immunoprecipitation. The truncted MMP-1 was detected by ELISA. Flow cytometry analysis was applied to measure ligand-receptor interaction between CXCR3 and CXCL10.
Results
β4GalT1 can promote the inflammatory process of arthritis. CXCR3 was N-glycosylated and its glycosylation regulated by β4GalT1. β4GalT1 can enhance the invasiveness of FLS by modifying CXCR3. N-glycosylation of CXCR3 influences the ligand-receptor interaction between CXCR3 and CXCL10.
Conclusions
β4GalT1 can regulate N-glycans of CXCR3 in RA. N-glycans of CXCR3 affects CXCL10/CXCR3 ligand-binding which enhancing FLS invasion.

Abstract: Gap junctions are transmembrane structures that directly connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, making intercellular communications possible. It has been shown that the behaviour of several tumours – such as bone tumours – is related to gap junction intercellular communications (GJIC). Several methodologies are available for studying GJIC, based on measuring different parameters that are useful for multiple applications, such as the study of carcinogenesis for example. These methods nevertheless have several limitations. The present manuscript describes the setting up of a dielectrophoresis (DEP)-based lab-on-a-chip platform for the real-time study of Gap Junctional Intercellular Communication between osteosarcoma cells and the main cells accessible to their microenvironment. We conclude that using the DEParray technology for the GJIC assessment has several advantages comparing to current techniques. This methodology is less harmful for cells integrity; cells can be recovered after interaction to make further molecular analysis; it is possible to study GJIC in real time; we can promote cell interactions using up to five different populations. The setting up of this new methodology overcomes several difficulties to perform experiments for solving questions about GJIC process that we are not able to do with current technics.

Abstract: The trimeric AMP-activated kinase complex (AMPK) is conserved from yeast to humans and is best known for its role in balancing energy metabolism. Additional functions, including the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis, have been proposed for the SNF1 complex, the baker’s yeast homolog of AMPK. We here demonstrate that this function is conserved in the Crabtree-negative milk yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. Deletion mutants in the genes encoding the subunits of the trimeric complex (Klsnf1, Klgal83, Klsnf4) displayed increased sensitivities towards cell wall stress agents and a mutant lacking the kinase subunit had a thinner cell wall in transmission electron micrographs as compared to wild type. Epistasis analyses demonstrated that the KlSNF1 complex acts in parallel to cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling and stress sensitivities of Klsnf1 deletions can be suppressed by additional deletions in glycolytic genes (KlPFK1, KlPFK2, KlPGI1) or by a Klmig1 mutant. Western blot analyses of an HA-tagged KlMig1p revealed its phosphorylation on ethanol medium similar to its S. cerevisiae ortholog, but a substantial amount of protein remained phosphorylated even with high glucose concentrations. Application of cell wall stress shifted this equilibrium towards the non-phosphorylated fraction of KlMig1p. We conclude that KlMig1p may exert a negative regulatory function on cell wall biosynthesis.

Abstract: Ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain-containing proteins constitute a family of proteins and are substrate adaptors of AAA ATPase Cdc48. UBX proteins can bind to the N-terminal region of Cdc48 to perform endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD). In this study, we identified two UBX domain-containing proteins, Ubx1 and Ubx2, in Pichia pastoris and found that the two proteins could recover the growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in ubx2Δ. Our results revealed that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play critical roles in synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids by affecting Spt23. In addition, the results demonstrated that both Ubx1 and Ubx2 are involved in lipid droplet formation and protein degradation. Deletion of UBX1 led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and disruption of UBX2 impaired cell viability under osmotic stress. The phenotypes of ubx1Δ+UBX2, ubx2Δ+UBX1 and ubx1Δubx2Δ and RNA-seq data suggested that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play different roles in cell functions, and the roles of Ubx1 may be more numerous than Ubx2. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the relationship between lipid homeostasis and cell functions in the oil-producing organism P. pastoris.

Abstract: The PV modules are inevitably installed outdoors and receive direct sunlight. Therefore, protective glass or film is required to protect the surface of the PV module from the wind, rain, snow and dust, and other environments. However, the incident light is reflected from the surfaces of these protective layers, resulting in a considerable efficiency loss. In this study, we developed a moth-eye structure with HSQ using a direct-transfer printing process to fabricate anti-reflective coatings on the protective glass. In addition, we also conducted long-term field tests to monitor and measure the impact of the fabricated anti-reflective structures and durability against environmental factors. The transmittance of the glass substrate increased to 95.0% as a result of the fabricated SiOx-based moth-eye patterns. In addition, the PV module with the moth-eye-patterned protective glass generated 7.88% more electricity compared to that without the moth-eye-patterned glass during 1-year field test.

Abstract: While progress has been made in understanding the behaviour of the recently identified carrier-induced degradation mechanism in p-type multicrystalline silicon solar cells, little is currently known about the root cause of the defect or its possible existence in other materials. In this work, we present evidence suggesting that the defect also exists in Czochralski grown monocrystalline silicon wafers. For both mono- and multicrystalline silicon we demonstrate: 1) the presence of a degradation and recovery of bulk minority carrier lifetime induced by either illuminated or dark annealing; 2) a modulation in the magnitude of degradation by varying the firing conditions; and 3) capture cross-section ratios of 39.4 ± 4.9 and 33.4 ± 1.5 in monocrystalline and multicrystalline silicon, respectively. The results indicate that the recently identified degradation mechanism does not only occur in multicrystalline silicon from illuminated annealing at elevated temperatures, but it is also induced by dark annealing at elevated temperatures, and that the degradation can occur in Czochralski grown silicon.

Abstract: Methylglyoxal regulates cell division and differentiation through its interaction with polyamines. Loss of their biosynthesizing enzyme causes physiological impairment and cell elongation in eukaryotes. However, the reciprocal effects of methylglyoxal and polyamine production and its regulatory metabolic switches on morphological changes in prokaryotes have not been addressed. Here, Bacillus subtilis methylglyoxal synthase (mgsA) and polyamine biosynthesizing genes encoding arginine decarboxylase (SpeA), agmatinase (SpeB), and spermidine synthase (SpeE), were disrupted or overexpressed. Treatment of 0.2mM methylglyoxal and 1mM spermidine led to the elongation and shortening of B. subtilis wild-type cells to 12.38±3.21μm (P<0.05) and 3.24±0.73μm (P<0.01), respectively, compared to untreated cells (5.72±0.68μm). mgsA-deficient (mgsA−) and -overexpressing (mgsAOE) mutants also demonstrated cell shortening and elongation, similar to speB- and speE-deficient (speB− and speE−) and -overexpressing (speBOE and speEOE) mutants. Importantly, both mgsA-depleted speBOE and speEOE mutants (speBOE/mgsA− and speEOE/mgsA−) were drastically shortened to 24.5% and 23.8% of parental speBOE and speEOE mutants, respectively. These phenotypes were associated with reciprocal alterations of mgsA and polyamine transcripts governed by the contents of methylglyoxal and spermidine, which are involved in enzymatic or genetic metabolite-control mechanisms. Additionally, biophysically detected methylglyoxal-spermidine Schiff bases did not affect morphogenesis. Taken together, the findings indicate that methylglyoxal triggers cell elongation. Furthermore, cells with methylglyoxal accumulation commonly exhibit an elongated rod-shaped morphology through upregulation of mgsA, polyamine genes, and the global regulator spx, as well as repression of the cell division and shape regulator, FtsZ.

Abstract: A closed-surface silica antireflection thin film was prepared in single dipping process by growing branched silica chain from modified acid catalyzed sol-gel in hollow silica sphere sol-gel. The refractive index and thickness of thin film could be fine-tuned via acid catalyzed sol-gel content and withdrawing speed. Transmittance of this closed-surface AR thin film was as high as 97.1% with refractive index around 1.25–1.27. 2.5% gain in short circuit current was measured from both external quantum efficiency and flashing test on mini photovoltaic modules. The closed-surface structure was with a 5H pencil hardness, and approximately 2.0GPa indent hardness in nanoindenter test. It was resistant to high moisture and high temperature, mainly due to absence of voids on surface. The closed-surface AR thin film had potential to be applied in photovoltaic module, architecture windows in severe climate conditions.

Abstract: There is scarce information regarding the concentration of cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and their clinical association with CNS status. A prospective analysis of 40 patients <18years with newly diagnosed ALL was performed. Human cytokine magnetic bead panel assay values of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, TNF-α in CSF at diagnosis, end of induction to remission, and 6months after diagnosis were determined. IL-6 and MCP-1 values showed a significant increment at the end of induction. From the whole group 4 (10.0%), patients relapsed to the CNS at a median of 11.48months. A significantly higher value of TNF-α at third determination in these CNS-relapsed patients was documented, 7.48 vs. 2.86pg/mL in 36 children without relapse (p=0.024). TNF-α concentration increased at a median 5.48months before CNS relapse. By receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, the best cut-off point of TNF-α concentration that better predicted CNS relapse was ≥1.79pg/mL. In conclusion an increase in TNF-α concentration on CSF preceded CNS relapse in children with ALL. An increase in MCP-1 and IL-6 was not associated to CNS relapse and appears to result from an inflammatory response after IT injection of chemotherapy.

Abstract: An oral therapeutic which reduces duration of cytopenias and is active following accidental radiation exposures is an unmet need in radiation countermeasures. Alpha methylhydrocinnamate (ST7) prolongs STAT-5 phosphorylation, reduces growth-factor dependency of multi-lineage cell lines, and stimulates erythropoiesis. Here, ST7 and its isomers were studied for their effects on myeloid progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) following radiation, in nonhuman primates, and murine irradiation models. Addition of ST7 or ST7-S increased CFU-GM production by 1.7-fold (p<0.001), reduced neutrophil apoptosis comparable to G-CSF, and enhanced HSC survival post-radiation by 2-fold, (p=0.028). ST7 and ST7-S administered in normal baboons increased ANC and platelet counts by 50–400%. In sub-lethally-irradiated mice, ANC nadir remained >200/mm3 and neutropenia recovered in 6days with ST7 treatment and 18days in controls (p<0.05). In lethally-irradiated mice, marrow pathology at 15days was hypocellular (10% cellularity) in controls, but normal (55–75% cellularity) with complete neutrophil maturation with ST7-S treatment. Following lethal irradiation, ST7, given orally for 4days, reduced mortality, with 30% survival in ST7-animals vs 8% in controls, (p<0.05). Collectively, the studies indicate that ST7 and ST7-S enhance myeloid recovery post-radiation and merit further evaluation to accelerate hematologic recovery in conditions of radiation-related and other marrow hypoplasias.

Abstract: Regeneration of skeletal muscle relies on the presence of satellite cells. Satellite cells deficiency accompanying some degenerative diseases is the reason for the search for the “replacement cells” that can be used in the muscle therapies. Due to their unique properties embryonic stem cells (ESCs), as well as myogenic cells derived from them, are considered as a promising source of therapeutic cells. Among the factors crucial for the specification of myogenic precursor cells is Pax7 that sustains proper function of satellite cells. In our previous studies we showed that ESCs lacking functional Pax7 are able to form myoblasts in vitro when differentiated within embryoid bodies and their outgrowths. In the current study we showed that ESCs lacking functional Pax7, cultured in vitro in monolayer in the medium supplemented with horse serum and 5azaC, expressed higher levels of factors associated with myogenesis, such as Pdgfra, Pax3, Myf5, and MyoD. Importantly, skeletal myosin immunolocalization confirmed that myogenic differentiation of ESCs was more effective in case of cells lacking Pax7. Our in vivo studies showed that ESCs transplanted into regenerating skeletal muscles were detectable at day 7 of regeneration and the number of Pax7-/- ESCs detected was significantly higher than of control cells. Our results support the concept that lack of functional Pax7 promotes proliferation of differentiating ESCs and for this reason more of them can turn into myogenic lineage.

Abstract: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder causing oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding disorder and ceroid lipofuscinosis. Platelets from HPS patients are characterized by impaired secretion of dense (δ)-bodies (CD63). Meanwhile, there are ten known human HPS genes, each leading to a particular clinical HPS subtype (HPS1-HPS10). We report on two Turkish brothers showing typical HPS phenotype comprising oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding symptoms. Pathological bleeding time as well as platelet aggregometry analyses revealed impaired platelet function. The brothers demonstrated absence of platelet δ-granule secretion as measured by flow cytometry. Using molecular genetic analyses, a novel homozygous 1bp-deletion in the HPS3 gene was identified in both brothers. In addition, the younger brother with HPS3 demonstrated psychomotoric retardation and cranial gliosis (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). Array-CGH analysis revealed a de novo 0.482Mb deletion on chromosome 17 which is not present in his brother and parents. In this study, we identified a novel 1bp-deletion in the HPS3 gene causing HPS3 phenotype in two brothers. In patients with oculocutaneous albinism and increased bleeding symptoms platelet function should be analyzed. The identification of the molecular genetic defect allows the classification to a particular HPS subtype and is important for therapy and prognosis.

Abstract: Yeast dynamin, Vacuolar Protein Sorting 1 (Vps1), has been implicated in recycling traffic from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Previous research showed a genetic interaction of Vps1 with all components of the GARP tethering complex, which anchors vesicles at the late Golgi membrane. We used the yeast two-hybrid system and have identified a 33 amino acid segment of Vps51, a GARP subunit, that interacts with Vps1. Based on sequence homology between Vps51 and its mammalian homolog Ang2 in the 33 amino acids stretch, we identified two key residues of Vps51, E127 and Y129, that bind Vps1. The replacement of these residues led to severe defects in endosome-to-TGN transport of Snc1, providing evidence of the physiological relevance of the interaction of Vps51 with Vps1 for the traffic. Furthermore, our functional analysis revealed that Vps1 acts upstream of Vps51 and that the absence of Vps1 resulted in reduced localization levels of Vps51 and its binding partner Tlg1 to the late Golgi. Taken together, we propose that Vps1 functions with the GARP tethering machinery for efficient tethering/fusion at the TGN.

Abstract: Prevalence of cardiac and liver iron overload in patients with thalassemia in real-world practice may vary among different regions especially in the era of widely-used iron chelation therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of cardiac and liver iron overload in and the management patterns of patients with thalassemia in real-world practice in Thailand. We established a multicenter registry for patients with thalassemia who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of their clinical evaluation. All enrolled patients underwent cardiac and liver MRI for assessment of iron overload. There were a total of 405 patients enrolled in this study. The mean age of patients was 18.8±12.5years and 46.7% were male. Two hundred ninety-six (73.1%) of patients received regular blood transfusion. Prevalence of cardiac iron overload (CIO) and liver iron overload (LIO) was 5.2% and 56.8%, respectively. Independent predictors for iron overload from laboratory information were serum ferritin and transaminase for both CIO and LIO. Serum ferritin can be used as a screening tool to rule-out CIO and to diagnose LIO. Iron chelation therapy was given in 74.6%; 15.3% as a combination therapy.

Abstract: Cisplatin (DDP) is the first line chemotherapeutic drug for several cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). Unfortunately, the rapid development of drug resistance remains a significant challenge for the clinical application of cisplatin. There is an urgent need to develop new strategies to overcome DDP resistance for cancer treatment. In this study, four types of human GC cells have been divided into naturally sensitive or naturally resistant categories according to their responses to cisplatin. PARP1 activity (poly (ADP-ribose), PAR) was found to be greatly increased in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. PARP1 inhibitors significantly enhanced cisplatin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in the resistant GC cells via the inhibition of PAR. Mechanistically, PARP1 inhibitors suppress DNA-PKcs stability and reduce the capability of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via the NHEJ pathway. This was also verified in BGC823/DDP GC cells with acquired cisplatin resistance. In conclusion, we identified that PARP1 is a useful interceptive target in cisplatin-resistant GC cells. Our data provide a promising therapeutic strategy against cisplatin resistance in GC cells that has potential translational significance.

Abstract: The addition of Ag to Cu-Ga-In precursors for reaction to form (AgCu)(InGa)Se2 has shown benefits including improved adhesion, greater process tolerance and potential for improved device performance. In this study, metal precursors were sputtered with a Cu-Ga/In/Ag-Ga sequence with Ag/(Cu+Ag) = 0.25 and (Ag+Cu)/(Ga+In) = 0.90. These precursor layers are shown to be unstable, with a phase evolution during storage at room temperature revealed by x-ray diffraction (XRD). This behavior was studied in samples annealed in the temperature range of 60–150°C or stored for up to 90 days. XRD analyses indicated the formation of (Ag1−xCux)In2 with Cu content of 28% and 36% for samples annealed at 100°C and 150°C, respectively. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and XRD analyses on selenized samples showed a uniform distribution of Ag and Cu through the films and a Ga accumulation near the back interface. Solar cells fabricated from the selenized films showed improved device performance in VOC and FF as a result of the precursor anneal.

Abstract: Background
Investigating the biological functions of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is limited by the interference of vast numbers of putative sources and causes of DNA release into circulation. Utilization of three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cell cultures, models with characteristics closer to the in vivo state, may be of significant benefit for cfDNA research.
Methods
CfDNA was isolated from the growth medium of C3A spheroid cultures in rotating bioreactors during both normal growth and treatment with acetaminophen. Spheroid growth was monitored via planimetry, lactate dehydrogenase activity and glucose consumption and was related to isolated cfDNA characteristics.
Results
Changes in spheroid growth and stability were effectively mirrored by cfDNA characteristics. CfDNA characteristics correlated with that of previous two-dimensional (2D) cell culture and human plasma research.
Conclusions
3D spheroid cultures can serve as effective, simplified in vivo-simulating “closed-circuit” models since putative sources of cfDNA are limited to only the targeted cells. In addition, cfDNA can also serve as an alternative or auxiliary marker for tracking spheroid growth, development and culture stability.
Biological significance
3D cell cultures can be used to translate “closed-circuit” in vitro model research into data that is relevant for in vivo studies and clinical applications. In turn, the utilization of cfDNA during 3D culture research can optimize sample collection without affecting the stability of the growth environment. Combining 3D culture and cfDNA research could, therefore, optimize both research fields.

Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles represent a new paradigm for molecular targeting therapy in cancer. However, the transformative targeting potential of magnetic nanoparticles has been stymied by a key obstacle-safe delivery to specified target cells in vivo. As cancer cells grow under nutrient deprivation and hypoxic conditions and decorate cell surface with excessive sialoglycans, sialic acid binding lectins might be suitable for targeting cancer cells in vivo. Here we explore the potential of magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with wheat germ lectin (WGA) conjugate, so-called nanomagnetolectin, as apoptotic targetable agents for prostate cancer. In the presence of magnetic field (magnetofection) for 15min, 2.46nM nanomagnetolectin significantly promoted apoptosis (∼12-fold, p value <0.01) of prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145) compared to normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC, PNT2, PZ-HPV-7), when supplemented with 10mM sialic acid under nutrient deprived condition. Nanomagnetolectin targets cell-surface glycosylation, particularly sialic acid as nanomagnetolectin induced apoptosis of cancer cells largely diminished (only 2 to 2.5-fold) compared to normal cells. The efficacy of magnetofected nanomagnetolectin was demonstrated in orthotopically xenografted (DU-145) mice, where tumor was not only completely arrested, but also reduced significantly (p value <0.001). This was further corroborated in subcutaneous xenograft model, where nanomagnetolectin in the presence of magnetic field and photothermal heating at ∼42°C induced apoptosis of tumor by ∼4-fold compared to tumor section heated at ∼42°C, but without magnetic field. Taken all together, the study demonstrates, for the first time, the utility of nanomagnetolectin as a potential cancer therapeutic.

Abstract: Novel optically-rough and physically-flat transparent conductive oxides (TCO) substrates were developed by spin-coating Al doped Zn1−xMgxO (AZMO) transparent conductive thin film on roughened glass substrates treated by a reactive-ion etching (RIE) process, for enhancing the light-absorption in superstrate-type solar cells without deteriorating growth of photoactive layers. These substrates possess features of high transmittance, low surface roughness and strong light-scattering behavior. A surface morphology of randomly distributed irregular cones was formed on the Corning 7059 glass substrate through the overlapping of several lens-shaped cavities etched by the carbon tetrafluoride-oxygen plasma during the RIE process. This rough interface morphology not only has light-scattering ability, but also shows an antireflection effect at the interface between the AZMO and RIE etched glass substrate. One prototype with 40 cycles AZMO coating on a RIE etched substrate showed a root-mean-square surface roughness of 4.6nm, a sheet resistance of 75.1Ω/sq, and a haze ratio in transmission of 12.2% at the wavelength of 700nm. These TCO substrates were applied to the front electrode of superstrate-type hydrogenated amorphous Si single junction solar cells. The solar cells exhibited a current gain of 11% and an efficiency gain of 14% as well as similar open-circuit voltage and fill factor with respect to the ones deposited on the AZMO coated flat glass substrate. These substrates would enable an efficient light management and the growth of high quality photoactive materials simultaneously for superstrate-type thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Pediatric arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is an uncommon but important cause of neurologic morbidity in neonates and children, with consequences including hemiparesis, intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy. The causes of pediatric AIS are unique to those typically associated with stroke in adults. Familiarity with the risk factors for AIS in children will help with efficient diagnosis, which is unfortunately frequently delayed. Here we review the epidemiology and risk factors for AIS in neonates and children. We also outline consensus-based practices in the evaluation and management of pediatric AIS. Finally we discuss the outcomes observed in this population. While much has been learned in recent decades, many uncertainties sill persist in regard to pediatric AIS. The ongoing development of specialized centers and investigators dedicated to pediatric stroke will continue to answer such questions and improve our ability to effectively care for these patients.

Abstract: The miniaturization of finger electrodes is an area of active research in the crystalline silicon solar cell industry, and diverse trials have been conducted with various printing techniques, including stencil, laser, aerosol jet, inkjet, electrohydrodynamic jet, and dispensing printing. Among these techniques, dispensing printing is regarded as promising due to its superior capability to construct fine finger electrodes with a high aspect ratio and homogeneity by single-pass printing without direct contact with the solar cell wafer. However, its requirements of a small nozzle, short stand-off distance between the nozzle and the solar cell, and specially formulated highly viscous silver paste with a high yield stress raise the issues of nozzle clogging, nozzle breakage by colliding with the solar cell, and the challenges of developing a dispensing printer that can accommodate high pneumatic pressures. In this study, a robust resolution of the aforementioned issues is proposed using graphite nanofibres. The small addition of graphite nanofibres to conventional silver paste greatly enhances the elongational property of silver paste. By stretching the silver paste filament with the enhanced elongational property, the diameter of the silver paste filament is reduced and a finger width of 47.7µm was achieved, which is finer by 21.4µm than the finger width achieved using paste without the graphite nanofibres. Moreover, the stable construction of finger electrodes is enabled with graphite nanofibres at a stand-off distance as far as 1mm and a printing speed as fast as 100mm/s. The resulting cell efficiency with graphite nanofibres is higher by +0.22%p (average) and +0.30%p (median) than those obtained without graphite nanofibres.

Abstract: GAEC1 (Gene amplified in esophageal cancer 1) alterations have oncogenic properties in oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas and frequent amplifications of the gene were noted in colorectal adenocarcinomas. However, the subcellular localization and expression of GAEC1 at the protein level have never been reported in human cancer cells. The present study aimed to investigate whether GAEC1 is differentially expressed in different stages of colon cancer and to elucidate its underlying cellular and molecular mechanism in colon cancer progression. We found differential expression of GAEC1 protein and mRNA in different pathological stages of colon cancer cells (SW480-Stage II, SW48-Stage III and HCT116-Stage IV) when compared to non-neoplastic colon cells (FHC cells) by immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. GAEC1 protein was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of colon cancer cells (SW480, SW48, and HCT116) and in the nucleus of non-neoplastic colon epithelial cells (FHC cells). The transient knockdown of GAEC1 using siRNA induced apoptosis in SW480 and SW48 cells, which was associated with G2/M phase arrest and decreased expression of bcl-2 and K-ras proteins and increased expression of p53. In addition, down-regulation of GAEC1 significantly inhibited (p<0.05) cell proliferation, reduced migration capacity and decreased clonogenic potentiality of colon cancer cells (SW480 and SW48 cells). Furthermore, a xenotransplantation model showed that stable knockdown of GAEC1 using shRNA constructs in colon cancer cells fully suppressed xenograft tumour growth in mice. Collectively, the expression analysis, in vitro and in vivo data indicated that GAEC1 is differentially expressed in cancer cells and act as an oncogene in colon cancer progression.

Abstract: Background
Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by an increased incidence of thromboembolic events, especially when immunomodulatory drugs are used. Currently, our ability to predict these thrombotic events is limited. We hypothesized that global coagulation tests may be predictive of thrombotic events in MM patients.
Methods
Blood samples were taken from 36 MM patients before and during routine treatment. Thrombin generation (TG) tests including endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and peak height were analyzed.
Results
Patients were followed for a median of 2.5years. Those who developed thrombotic events were characterized by significantly higher ETP and peak height values compared to those who did not (P=0.001). In these patients, we identified a gradual increase in TG parameters that preceded the thrombotic event. Anticoagulation therapy was associated with a significant decrease in ETP and peak height values (P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in TG parameters between newly diagnosed MM patients and healthy subjects, as well as between MM patients prior to and during chemotherapy.
Conclusions
TG tests might predict thrombotic events in MM patients. Thus, TG tests may be incorporated into decision-making protocols of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in MM patients.

To explore whether these SNPs modulate HbF expression in Chinese Zhuang population, 436 Chinese Zhuang β-thalassemia intermedia (β-TI) patients were divided into high HbF level group (mean HbF=25.5%, n=218) and low group (mean HbF=6.51%, n=218) for genotyping using PCR-HRM method. Results demonstrated that there was a significantly higher minor allele frequency (MAF=34.2%) of rs4895441 (G) in HMIP in high HbF level group than that in low group (MAF=19.8%) (P=0.001, OR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.24–2.57). The cumulative effects of risk genotypes of these loci for patients carrying any combination of 1, 2 or 3 risk genotype had a gradually increased risk of high HbF level phenotype compared to those without the risk genotypes (OR=1.50–9.06, P=0.0008); Gene-gene interaction of rs7842144 and rs4895441 showed the best model with the smallest prediction error (0.4259) and the greatest consistency of coefficient of variation (P=0.01). We concluded that rs4895441, G on HMIP might be a high-risk modifier variant for high HbF level expression, and HBG2, BCL11A and HMIP genes, as HbF quantitative trait loci (QTL) could have a synergistic effect on increasing the HbF level in Chinese Zhuang β-TI patients.

Abstract: We have previously reported that the basal RasG activity is aberrantly high in cells lacking Superoxide dismutase C (SodC). Here we report that other Ras proteins such as RasC and RasD activities are not affected in sodC− cells and mutagenesis studies showed that the presence of the Cys118 in the Ras proteins is essential for the superoxide-mediated activation of Ras proteins in Dictyostelium. In addition to the loss of SodC, lack of extracellular magnesium ions increased the level of intracellular superoxide and active RasG proteins. Aberrantly active Ras proteins in sodC− cells persistently localized at the plasma membrane, but those in wild type cells under magnesium deficient medium exhibited intracellular vesicular localization. Interestingly, the aberrantly activated Ras proteins in wild type cells were largely insulated from their normal downstream events such as Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-P3 (PIP3) accumulation, Protein Kinase B (PKB) activation, and PKBs substrates phosphorylation. Intriguingly, however, aberrantly activated Ras proteins in sodC− cells were still engaged in signaling to their downstream targets, and thus excessive PKBs substrates phosphorylation persisted. In summary, we suggest that SodC and RasG proteins are essential part of a novel inhibitory mechanism that discourages oxidatively stressed cells from chemotaxis and thus inhibits the delivery of potentially damaged genome to the next generation.

Abstract: Many studies demonstrated that there are several type bands of prion protein in cells. However, the formation of different prion protein bands is elusive. After several low molecular weight bands of prion protein appeared in SMB-S15 cells infected with scrapie agent Chandler, we think that IRES-dependent translation mechanism induced by prion is involved in the formation of prion protein bands. Then we designed a series of pPrP-GFP fusing plasmids and bicistronic plasmids to identify the IRES sites of prion protein gene and found 3 IRES sites inside of PrP mRNA. We also demonstrated that cap-independent translation of PrP was associated with the ER stress through Tunicamycin treatment. We still found that only IRE1 and PERK pathway regulated the IRES-dependent translation of PrP in this study. Our results indicated, we found that PrP gene had an IRES-dependent translation initiation mechanism and we successfully identified the IRESs inside of the prion protein gene.

Abstract: Studies within the last decade have localized the functional expression of olfactory receptors (ORs) to cells outside of the olfactory epithelium. In human hepatocarcinoma and prostate cancer cells, the activation of ORs by odors modulates elementary physiological processes and leads to an inhibitory effect on proliferation. Cells of the respiratory tract are in direct contact with the surrounding air, in which a myriad of volatile molecules, especially odors, are present. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a high prevalence, a high mortality rate and is difficult to treat. NSCLC cells are nearly resistant to common chemotherapeutic approaches, and surgical resection provides the only possible chance of a cure for most patients. New approaches for the treatment of NSCLC are the focus of many current studies. Thus, it is of interest to characterize the functional expression of ORs in cancer cells of the lung and to investigate the impact of ORs on pathophysiological processes. In the present study, we demonstrate that the expression of OR2J3 and cytosolic Ca2+ increase via the activation of the agonist helional in the NSCLC cell line A549. We further investigated the underlying pathway. Helional triggers phoshoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), signaling the release of intracellular Ca2+ and phosphorylation of ERK. We observed that OR2J3 activation induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and migration in long-term stimulus experiments with helional. Our study provides the first evidence of the functional expression of an OR in NSCLC cells and its putative therapeutic impact.

Abstract: Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is highly expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, where it catalyzes one of the final steps in the biosynthesis of bioactive peptides. PAM is also expressed in unicellular organisms such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which do not store peptides in secretory granules. As for other granule membrane proteins, PAM is retrieved from the cell surface and returned to the trans-Golgi network. This pathway involves regulated entry of PAM into multivesicular body intralumenal vesicles (ILVs). The aim of this study was defining the endocytic pathways utilized by PAM in cells that do not store secretory products in granules. Using stably transfected HEK293 cells, endocytic trafficking of PAM was compared to that of the mannose 6-phosphate (MPR) and EGF (EGFR) receptors, established markers for the endosome to trans-Golgi network and degradative pathways, respectively. As in neuroendocrine cells, PAM internalized by HEK293 cells accumulated in the trans-Golgi network. Based on surface biotinylation, >70% of the PAM on the cell surface was recovered intact after a 4h chase and soluble, bifunctional PAM was produced. Endosomes containing PAM generally contained both EGFR and MPR and ultrastructural analysis confirmed that all three cargos accumulated in ILVs. PAM containing multivesicular bodies made frequent dynamic tubular contacts with younger and older multivesicular bodies. Frequent dynamic contacts were observed between lysosomes and PAM containing early endosomes and multivesicular bodies. The ancient ability of PAM to localize to ciliary membranes, which release bioactive ectosomes, may be related to its ability to accumulate in ILVs and exosomes.

Abstract: Human hair follicle (HF) growth and hair shaft formation require terminal differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest of highly proliferative matrix keratinocytes. However, the regulation of this complex event remains unknown. CIP/KIP family member proteins (p21CIP1, p27KIP1 and p57KIP2) regulate cell cycle progression/arrest, endoreplication, differentiation and apoptosis. Since they have not yet been adequately characterized in the human HF, we asked whether and where CIP/KIP proteins localise in the human hair matrix and pre-cortex in relation to cell cycle activity and HF-specific epithelial cell differentiation that is marked by keratin 85 (K85) protein expression. K85 expression coincided with loss or reduction in cell cycle activity markers, including in situ DNA synthesis (EdU incorporation), Ki-67, phospho-histone H3 and cyclins A and B1, affirming a post-mitotic state of pre-cortical HF keratinocytes. Expression of CIP/KIP proteins was found abundantly within the proliferative hair matrix, concomitant with a role in cell cycle checkpoint control. p21CIP1, p27KIP1 and cyclin E persisted within post-mitotic keratinocytes of the pre-cortex, whereas p57KIP2 protein decreased but became nuclear. These data imply a supportive role for CIP/KIP proteins in maintaining proliferative arrest, differentiation and anti-apoptotic pathways, promoting continuous hair bulb growth and hair shaft formation in anagen VI. Moreover, post-mitotic hair matrix regions contained cells with enlarged nuclei, and DNA in situ hybridisation showed cells that were >2N in the pre-cortex. This suggests that CIP/KIP proteins might counterbalance cyclin E to control further rounds of DNA replication in a cell population that has a propensity to become tetraploid. These data shed new light on the in situ-biography of human hair matrix keratinocytes on their path of active cell cycling, arrest and terminal differentiation, and showcase the human HF as an excellent, clinically relevant model system for cell cycle physiology research of human epithelial cells within their natural tissue habitat.

Yeast dynamin Vps1 associates with clathrin to facilitate vesicular trafficking and controls Golgi homeostasis,

Abstract: The yeast dynamin Vps1 acts cooperatively with many proteins at diverse cellular locations for endocytosis, protein sorting, and membrane fusion and fission. It has been proposed that Vps1 is functionally linked to clathrin heavy chain 1 (Chc1), but the question of how, where, and when they function together remains unknown. Here we report that Vps1 arrives at the Golgi after clathrin, and that loss of Vps1 leads to a shift in the cellular localization of clathrin to the late endosome and vacuole, not vice versa. Our two-hybrid-based approach provides evidence that full-length Vps1 and its truncated versions bind to the C-terminal region of the Chc1. Cells lacking both Vps1 and Chc1 displayed more severe defects in carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) sorting at the Golgi than those in Vps1-deficient cells. Further, these Vps1 fragments became dominant-negative for CPY sorting upon overexpression. These results suggest that Vps1 binds to Chc1 and functions together at the Golgi for efficient Golgi-to-endosome membrane trafficking. In addition, we found that Vps1, without the aid of clathrin, plays a role in controlling the number and turnover of late Golgi.

Abstract: In recent years the thermal energy storage applications with phase change materials have attracted wide interest. This has motivated a number of R&D efforts to develop novel materials and design new applications based on PCM. The efficient design of the new applications majorly depends on the quality of PCM employed. Numbers of reviews, reports have been written to compile the wide range of PCMs made available for different applications. This paper focuses on the development of next generation PCMs through the enhancement of thermophysical properties namely thermal conductivity, latent heat of fusion and sensible heat. The paper presents a detailed review of the research updates in this direction so as to produce PCMs with enhanced efficiency in terms of thermal energy storage and efficient heat transfer.

Abstract: Macrophages play crucial role in tissue homeostasis and the innate and adaptive immune response. Depending on the state of activation macrophages acquire distinct phenotypes that depend on actin, which is regulated by small GTPase RhoA. The naive M0 macrophages are slightly elongated, pro-inflammatory M1 are round and M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages are elongated. We showed previously that interference with RhoA pathway (RhoA deletion or RhoA/ROCK kinase inhibition) disrupted actin, produced extremely elongated (hummingbird) macrophage phenotype and inhibited macrophage movement toward transplanted hearts. The RhoA function depends on the family of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP and activate RhoA that reorganizes actin cytoskeleton. Using actin staining, immunostaining, Western blotting, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy we studied how a direct inhibition of Rho-GEFs with Rhosin (Rho GEF-binding domain blocker) and Y16 (Rho GEF DH-PH domain blocker) affects M0, M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes. We also studied how Rho-GEFs inhibition and RhoA deletion affects organization of Golgi complex that is crucial for normal macrophage functions such as phagocytosis, antigen presentation and receptor recycling. We found that GEFs inhibition differently affected M0, M1 and M2 macrophages phenotype and that GEFs inhibition and RhoA deletion both caused changes in the ultrastructure of the Golgi complex. These results suggest that actin/RhoA- dependent shaping of macrophage phenotype has different requirements for activity of RhoA/GEFs pathway in M0, M1 and M2 macrophages, and that RhoA and Rho-GEFs functions are necessary for the maintenance of actin-dependent organization of Golgi complex.

Abstract: The production of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is elevated in human breast cancer cells. The abnormal expression of COX-2, which is involved in the synthesis of PGE2, was recently reported as a critical determinant for invasiveness of human breast cancer cells. Autocrine and paracrine PGE2-mediated stimulation of the PGE2 receptor EP4 transduces multiple signaling pathways leading to diverse patho-physiological effects, including tumor cell invasion and metastasis. It is known that PGE2-induced EP4 activation can transactivate the intracellular signaling pathway of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In malignant cancer cells, EGFR pathway activation promotes invadopodia protrusions, which further leads to degradation of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Despite the known influence of EP4 on the EGFR signaling pathway, the effect of EP4 stimulation on invadopodia formation in human breast cancer was never tested directly. Here we demonstrate the involvement of EP4 in invasion and its effect on invadopodia in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells using 2D invadopodia and 3D invasion in vitro assays as well as intravital microscopy. The results show that stimulation with the selective EP4 agonist CAY10598 or PGE2 promotes invadopodia-mediated degradation of the ECM, as well as the invasion of breast cancer cells in in vitro models. The effect on matrix degradation can be abrogated via direct inhibition of EP4 signaling as well as via inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase, indicating that EP4-mediated effects on invadopodia-driven degradation are EGFR dependent. Finally, using xenograft mouse models, we show that short-term systemic treatment with CAY10598 results in a >9-fold increase in the number of invadopodia. These findings highlight the importance of further investigation on the role of EP4-EGFR crosstalk in invadopodia formation.

Abstract: Low plasma TFPI levels have been associated with an increased risk of DVT; however its association with TFPI gene polymorphisms is controversial and not yet studied in India. The aim of our study was to analyze prevalence of TFPI gene polymorphisms, evaluate their effects on its plasma levels and determine its association with DVT. Plasma level and genetic polymorphisms (33T>C, 399C>T and 536C>T) of TFPI were screened in subjects (100 DVT patients and 100 controls). Mean TFPI level in patients was significantly lower than controls (Patients: 33.55±11.72ng/ml, Controls: 48.05±13.68ng/ml, p<0.001). DVT patients had significantly higher prevalence of 399C>T (p=0.001, ORa: 5.69, CI: 1.14–28.46) and lower prevalence of 33T>C polymorphism (p<0.001, ORa: 0.239, CI: 0.065–0.871). The wild type (TT genotype) of 33T>C and variant form (CT and TT genotype) of 399C>T polymorphism was significantly associated with low TFPI levels. TFPI 536C>T polymorphism was absent in all subjects. In conclusion, dual nature of TFPI gene polymorphisms were established in our association study; 33T>C being protective and 399C>T as an important risk factor in Indian DVT patients, probably mediated by alteration in TFPI levels. These findings may prove a vital role in risk stratification and treatment of DVT.

Abstract: Cathepsins B and X are lysosomal cysteine carboxypeptidases suggested as having a redundant role in cancer. They are involved in a number of processes leading to tumor progression but their role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unknown. We have investigated the contribution of both cathepsins B and X in EMT using tumor cell lines differing in their expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers and cell morphology. Higher levels of both cathepsins are shown to promote EMT and are associated with the mesenchymal-like cell phenotype. Moreover, simultaneous knockdown of the two peptidases triggers a reverse, mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Of the two cathepsins, cathepsin B appears to be the stronger promotor of EMT. Furthermore, we evaluated the involvement of cathepsin B and X in the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling pathway, one of the key signaling mechanisms triggering EMT in cancer. In MCF-7 cells the expression of cathepsin B was shown to depend on their activation with TGF-β1 while, for cathepsin X, a TGF-β1 independent mechanism of induction during EMT is indicated. EMT is thus shown to be another mechanism linking cathepsins B and X with tumor progression. With silencing of their expression or inhibition of enzymatic activity, the tumor cells could be reverted to less aggressive epithelial-like phenotype.

Abstract: As a Ca2+ binding protein, calreticulin (CRT) has many functions and plays an important role in a variety of tumors. The role of CRT in TGF-β1-induced EMT is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated in vitro that TGF-β1-induced EMT elevated the expression of CRT in A549 lung cancer cells. Subsequently, we confirmed that overexpression CRT had no capacity to induce A549 cells EMT alone, but successfully enhanced TGF-β1-induced-EMT. Furthermore, knockdown of CRT in A549 cells significantly suppressed changes of EMT marks expression induced by TGF-β1. On treatment with TGF-β1, overexpression of CRT could enhance the phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3. Consistently, the knockdown of CRT by siRNA-CRT could inhibit Smad signaling pathway activated by TGF-β1. These results indicated that CRT regulates EMT induced by TGF-β1 through Smad signaling pathway. Finally, TGF-β1-induced-EMT enhanced store-operated Ca2+ influx in A549 cells. CRT knockdown was able to abolish the effect of TGF-β1 on thapsigargin (TG) −induced Ca2+ release, but had failed to reduce store-operated Ca2+ influx. The alteration of intracellular Ca2+ concentration by TG or BAPTA-AM was able to regulate EMT induced by TGF-β1 through Smad signaling pathway. Together, these data identify that CRT regulates TGF-β1-induced-EMT through modulating Smad signaling. Furthermore, TGF-β1-induced-EMT is highly calcium-dependent, CRT was partly involved in it.

Abstract: Autophagy has been implicated in delayed aging and extended longevity. Here, we aimed to study the possible effects of autophagy during the progression of replicative senescence, which is one of the major features of aging. Human foreskin fibroblasts, Hs68 cells, at an initial passage of 15 were serially cultured for several months until they reached cellular senescence. A decrease in cell proliferation was observed during the progression of senescence. Induction of replicative senescence in aged cells (at passage 40) was confirmed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity that represents a sensitive and reliable marker for quantifying senescent cells. We detected a significantly increased percentage (%) of SA-β-gal-positive cells at passage 40 (63%) when compared with the younger SA-β-gal-positive cells at passage 15 (0.5%). Notably, the gradual decrease in basal autophagy coincided with replicative senescence induction. However, despite decreased basal autophagic activity in senescent cells, autophagy inducers could induce autophagy in senescent cells. RT-PCR analysis of 11 autophagy-related genes revealed that the decreased basal autophagy in senescent cells might be due to the downregulation of autophagy-regulatory proteins, but not autophagy machinery components. Moreover, the senescence phenotype was not induced in the cells in which rapamycin was added to the culture to continuously induce autophagy from passage 29 until passage 40. Together, our findings suggest that reduced basal autophagy levels due to downregulation of autophagy-regulatory proteins may be the mechanism underlying replicative senescence in Hs68 cells.

Abstract: Background and objective
Pulmonary Hypertension (pH) is a chronic progressive disease. Endothelial cells (EC) play a central and critical role in the initiation and progression of pH. The NF-κB family (NF-κB1 (p50/p105), NF-κB2 (p52/p100), RelA (p65), RelB, and C-Rel) regulates a wide array of genes involved in inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and survival. The involvement of specific NF-κB family members in the pathogenesis of hypoxia-induced pH remains to be determined. The objective of this study was to assess the specific role of individual NF-κB family members in mediating endothelial cell responses to hypoxia and its downstream effect on smooth muscle cell proliferation.
Methods and results
NF-κB family members’ expression were selectively reduced by siRNA in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Cells were then exposed to hypoxia (1%) for 24h. Endothelin1, ICAM1 gene expression and Stat1 and Stat3 phosphorylation were assessed. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) proliferation was assessed by culturing them with EC conditioned media. Reduction of either NF-κB2 or RelA in EC, led to a significant decrease in Endothelin1 and ICAM1 gene expression. C-Rel knockdown resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylated STAT1; both C-Rel and RelA knockdown significantly decreased phosphorylated STAT3 in EC. There was a significant reduction in SMC proliferation, and AKT/ERK phosphorylation in SMC, when cultured in RelA knockdown, EC conditioned media.
Conclusion
RelA in EC plays crucial role in hypoxia induced vascular remodeling and development of pH. Targeting RelA in EC alleviates SMC proliferation as well as inflammation related processes.

Abstract: In this paper we have presented a power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhanced Pb-chalcogenide/CdS quantum dots (QDs) solar cells with novel tandem absorption layers synthesized by using chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The tandem absorption layer is assembled by orderly stacking PbS-QDs layer, PbS-QDiM layer and PbSe-QDiM layer. Compared to single layer PbS-QDs/CdS solar cells, the solar cell with double-tandem layers (PbS-QDiM/QDs) shows the highest short current density (Jsc) of 47.5mA/cm2 due to smoothing of the photo-generated carrier transportation and enhancing the absorption in the visible region 530–800nm. However, the decreased open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.14eV results in a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.2%. The triple-tandem absorber (PbSe-QDiM/PbS-QDiM/QDs) enhances the spectra absorption both in the visible (500–800nm) and near-infrared (1000–1700nm) regions, resulting in a higher short current density (Jsc) of 40mA/cm2, while keeping a relatively large open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.28eV. Through an architectural modification, an enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.2% has been achieved.

Abstract: The acentriolar Dictyostelium centrosome is a nucleus-associated body consisting of a core structure with three plaque-like layers, which are surrounded by a microtubule-nucleating corona. The core duplicates once per cell cycle at the G2/M transition, whereby its central layer disappears and the two outer layers form the mitotic spindle poles. Through proteomic analysis of isolated centrosomes, we have identified CP39 and CP75, two essential components of the core structure. Both proteins can be assigned to the central core layer as their centrosomal presence is correlated to the disappearance and reappearance of the central core layer in the course of centrosome duplication. Both proteins contain domains with centrosome-binding activity in their N- and C-terminal halves, whereby the respective N-terminal half is required for cell cycle-dependent regulation. CP39 is capable of self-interaction and GFP-CP39 overexpression elicited supernumerary microtubule-organizing centers and pre-centrosomal cytosolic clusters. Underexpression stopped cell growth and reversed the MTOC amplification phenotype. In contrast, in case of CP75 underexpression of the protein by RNAi treatment elicited supernumerary MTOCs. In addition, CP75RNAi affects correct chromosome segregation and causes co-depletion of CP39 and CP91, another central core layer component. CP39 and CP75 interact with each other directly in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, CP39, CP75 and CP91 mutually interact in a proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) assay. Our data indicate that these three proteins are all required for proper centrosome biogenesis and make up the major structural components of core structure's central layer.

Abstract: During last years, evidence has been provided on the involvement of overweight and obesity in the pathogenesis and aggravation of several life-threatening diseases. Here, we demonstrate that, under appropriate administration conditions, polyhedral iron oxide nanoparticles are efficiently and safely taken up by 3T3 cell line-derived adipocytes (3T3 adipocytes) in vitro. Since these nanoparticles proved to effectively produce heat when subjected to alternating magnetic field, 3T3 adipocytes were submitted to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles-mediated hyperthermia treatment (SMHT), with the aim of modulating their lipid content. Notably, the treatment resulted in a significant delipidation persisting for at least 24h, and in the absence of cell death, damage or dedifferentiation. Interestingly, transcript expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a key gene involved in canonical lipolysis, was not modulated upon SMHT, suggesting the involvement of a novel/alternative mechanism in the effective lipolysis observed. By applying the same experimental conditions successfully used for 3T3 adipocytes, SMHT was able to induce delipidation also in primary cultures of human adipose-derived adult stem cells. The success of this pioneering approach in vitro opens promising perspectives for the application of SMHT in vivo as an innovative safe and physiologically mild strategy against obesity, potentially useful in association with balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.

Abstract: Effect of geometrical and structural parameters on the efficiency of the tandem solar cell based on the III-V nanowire array on silicon is studied by the means of coupled opto-electrical simulations. A close to realistic structure, consisting of AlGaAs core-shell nanowire array, connected through a tunnel diode to a Si subcell is modelled, revealing the impact of top contact layer, growth mask and tunnel junction. Optical simulation of the tandem structure under current matching condition determine optimal geometrical parameters of the nanowire array. They are then used in the extensive electrical optimization of the radial junction in the nanowire subcell. Device simulations show the necessity of high doping of the junction in order to avoid full shell depletion. The influence of bulk and surface recombination on the performance of the top subcell is studied, exposing the importance of the good surface passivation near the depleted region of the radial p−n junction. Finally, simulations of the fully optimized tandem structure show that a promising efficiency of η=27.6% with the short-circuit current of JSC=17.1mA/cm2 can be achieved with reasonable bulk and surface carrier lifetime.
