Abstract: Summary
Leber congenital amaurosis type 4 (LCA4), caused by AIPL1 mutations, is characterized by severe sight impairment in infancy and rapidly progressing degeneration of photoreceptor cells. We generated retinal organoids using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from renal epithelial cells obtained from four children with AIPL1 nonsense mutations. iPSC-derived photoreceptors exhibited the molecular hallmarks of LCA4, including undetectable AIPL1 and rod cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase (PDE6) compared with control or CRISPR-corrected organoids. Increased levels of cGMP were detected. The translational readthrough-inducing drug (TRID) PTC124 was investigated as a potential therapeutic agent. LCA4 retinal organoids exhibited low levels of rescue of full-length AIPL1. However, this was insufficient to fully restore PDE6 in photoreceptors and reduce cGMP. LCA4 retinal organoids are a valuable platform for in vitro investigation of novel therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Background
Progranulin (PGRN) is an important survival factor in the progression of multiple cancers.
Purpose
To explore the effects and mechanisms of PGRN on malignant biological behavior of osteosarcoma (OS) cells and the effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the hypoxic microenvironment on PGRN alteration.
Material and methods
The expression pattern of PGRN in OS were evaluated in OS tissues and cell lines. Next, a loss-of-function assay investigated the function of PGRN on the proliferation, migration and cell death of OS cells. The activation of MAPK signaling in the process was examined by western blot and functional experiments accompanied by skatole. Additionally, we internally silenced hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in MSCs along with exogenously added HIF-1α (exo-HIF-1α) to explore how MSCs affect PGRN alteration and the malignant behavior of OS cells.
Results
An aberrantly high expression of PGRN was observed in OS and associated with the poor prognosis of OS patients. PGRN knockdown repressed the proliferation, migration and induced cell death of OS cells, and activating MAPK pathway reversed these effects. Further evidence showed that MSCs regulated PGRN to mediate the malignant biological behavior of OS cells. Hypoxia enhanced HIF-1α expression in MSCs. HIF-1α silencing in MSCs under hypoxia suppressed the oncogenic effects of MSCs and reduced PGRN expression in OS cells, while the treatment of exo-HIF-1α reversed the depressive effects of HIF1α silencing on OS progression.
Conclusion
Overall, we concluded that PGRN, which was activated by the increase of hypoxic-MSCs-derived HIF-1α, promoted OS progression through the activation of MAPK signaling.

Abstract: CD93 is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the Group XIV C-Type lectin family. It is expressed in a variety of cellular types such as monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, microglia, and endothelial cells. CD93 has been reported to play important roles in cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor angiogenesis. Here, we show CD93 is highly expressed in M4 and M5 subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and highly expressed in leukemia stem cells, AML progenitor cells, as well as more differentiated AML cells. We found that CD93 promotes AML cell proliferation, while CD93 deficient AML cells commit to differentiation. We further show that CD93 exerts its proliferative function through downstream SHP-2/Syk/CREB cascade in AML cells. Moreover, human AML cells treated with CD93 mAb combined with αMFc–NC–DM1 (an IgG Fc specific antibody conjugated to maytansinoid DM1), showed a striking reduction of proliferation. Our study revealed that CD93 is a critical participator of AML development and provides a potential therapeutic cell surface target. (160 words).

Abstract: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by the abundance of lipid droplets and the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway. However, the lipid reprogramming induced by HIF signaling in ccRCC is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the fatty acid receptor CD36 was highly expressed in human ccRCC tissues and ccRCC cell lines. CD36 overexpression increased fatty acid uptake and lipid droplet formation, and enhanced the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells in a DGAT1-dependent manner. In contrast, the disruption of endogenous CD36 showed the opposite effects. The upregulated expression of CD36 in ccRCC was associated with hypoxia and HIF-2α activation. Furthermore, we identified CD36 as a new target of the transcription factor HIF-2α. The knockdown of CD36 in ccRCC cells reduced lipid accumulation and also blocked the tumor-promoting effects induced by HIF-2α under hypoxia. Our findings suggest that hypoxia-dependent HIF-2α promotes the remodeling of lipid metabolism and the malignant phenotype of ccRCC via CD36, providing a certain theoretical basis for clarifying the mechanism of ccRCC.

Abstract: CTP synthase (CTPS), a metabolic enzyme responsible for the de novo synthesis of CTP, can form filamentous structures termed cytoophidia, which are evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans. Here we used Schizosaccharomyces pombe to study the cytoophidium assembly regulation by ubiquitination. We tested the CTP synthase's capacity to be post-translationally modified by ubiquitin or be affected by the ubiquitination state of the cell and showed that ubiquitination is important for the maintenance of the CTPS filamentous structure in fission yeast. We have identified proteins which are in complex with CTPS, including specific ubiquitination regulators which significantly affect CTPS filamentation, and mapped probable ubiquitination targets on CTPS. Furthermore, we discovered that a cohort of deubiquitinating enzymes is important for the regulation of cytoophidium's filamentous morphology. Our study provides a framework for the analysis of the effects that ubiquitination and deubiquitination have on the formation of cytoophidia.

Abstract: Summary
Super-resolution imaging can generate thousands of single-particle trajectories. These data can potentially reconstruct subcellular organization and dynamics, as well as measure disease-linked changes. However, computational methods that can derive quantitative information from such massive datasets are currently lacking. We present data analysis and algorithms that are broadly applicable to reveal local binding and trafficking interactions and organization of dynamic subcellular sites. We applied this analysis to the endoplasmic reticulum and neuronal membrane. The method is based on spatiotemporal segmentation that explores data at multiple levels and detects the architecture and boundaries of high-density regions in areas measuring hundreds of nanometers. By connecting dense regions, we reconstructed the network topology of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as molecular flow redistribution and the local space explored by trajectories. The presented methods are available as an ImageJ plugin that can be applied to large datasets of overlapping trajectories offering a standard of single-particle trajectory (SPT) metrics.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is driven by vascular remodelling due to inflammation and cellular stress, including endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). The main ER-stress chaperone, glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78), is known to have protective effects in inflammatory diseases through extracellular signalling. The aim of this study is to investigate its significance in PAH. Human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) were stimulated with compounds that induce ER stress, after which the secretion of GRP78 into the cell medium was analysed by western blot. We found that when ER stress was induced in PASMC, there was also a time-dependent secretion of GRP78. Next, naïve PASMC were treated with conditioned medium (CM) from the ER-stressed donor PASMC. Incubation with CM from ER-stressed PASMC reduced the viability, oxidative stress, and expression of inflammatory and ER-stress markers in target cells. These effects were abrogated when the donor cells were co-treated with Brefeldin A to inhibit active secretion of GRP78. Direct treatment of PASMC with recombinant GRP78 modulated the expression of key inflammatory markers. Additionally, we measured GRP78 plasma levels in 19 PAH patients (Nice Group I) and correlated the levels to risk stratification according to ESC guidelines. Here, elevated plasma levels of GRP78 were associated with a favourable risk stratification. In conclusion, GRP78 is secreted by PASMC under ER stress and exhibits protective effects from the hallmarks of PAH in vitro. Circulating GRP78 may serve as biomarker for risk adjudication of patients with PAH.

Conditioned medium from ER-stressed PASMC reduces extensive viability, ROS formation, inflammation, and ER stress in target cells. These effects can be abolished by blocking protein secretion in donor cells by using Brefeldin A.Unlabelled Image

Abstract: Summary
Neuroeconomics studies how decision-making is guided by the value of rewards and punishments. But to date, little is known about how noxious experiences impact decisions. A challenge is the lack of an aversive stimulus that is dynamically adjustable in intensity and location, readily usable over many trials in a single experimental session, and compatible with multiple ways to measure neuronal activity. We show that skin laser stimulation used in human studies of aversion can be used for this purpose in several key animal models. We then use laser stimulation to study how neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), an area whose many roles include guiding decisions among different rewards, encode the value of rewards and punishments. We show that some OFC neurons integrated the positive value of rewards with the negative value of aversive laser stimulation, suggesting that the OFC can play a role in more complex choices than previously appreciated.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding who is at risk of progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is key to clinical decision making and effective treatment. We study correlates of disease severity in the COMET-ICE clinical trial that randomized 1:1 to placebo or to sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (ClinicalTrials.gov 04545060). Laboratory parameters identify study participants at greater risk of severe disease, including a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a negative SARS-CoV-2 serologic test, and whole-blood transcriptome profiles. Sotrovimab treatment is associated with normalization of NLR and the transcriptomic profile and with a decrease of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples. Transcriptomics provides the most sensitive detection of participants who would go on to be hospitalized or die. To facilitate timely measurement, we identify a 10-gene signature with similar predictive accuracy. We identify markers of risk for disease progression and demonstrate that normalization of these parameters occurs with antibody treatment of established infection.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron BA.2 was a dominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide. Recent reports hint that BA.2 is similarly potent regarding antibody evasion but may be more transmissible than BA.1. The pathogenicity of BA.2 remains unclear and is of critical public health significance. Here we investigated the virological features and pathogenicity of BA.2 with in vitro and in vivo models. We show that BA.2 is less dependent on transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for virus entry in comparison with BA.1 in vitro. In K18-hACE2 mice, BA.2 replicates more efficiently than BA.1 in the nasal turbinates and replicates marginally less efficiently in the lungs, leading to decreased body weight loss and improved survival. Our study indicates that BA.2 is similarly attenuated in lungs compared with BA.1 but is potentially more transmissible because of its better replication at the nasal turbinates.

Abstract: Summary
Imaging calcium signals in neurons of animals using single- or multi-photon microscopy facilitates the study of coding in large neural populations. Such experiments produce massive datasets requiring powerful methods to extract responses from hundreds of neurons. We present SpecSeg, an open-source toolbox for (1) segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) representing neuronal structures, (2) inspection and manual editing of ROIs, (3) neuropil correction and signal extraction, and (4) matching of ROIs in sequential recordings. ROI segmentation in SpecSeg is based on temporal cross-correlations of low-frequency components derived by Fourier analysis of each pixel with its neighbors. The approach is user-friendly, intuitive, and insightful and enables ROI detection around neurons or neurites. It works for single- (miniscope) and multi-photon microscopy data, eliminating the need for separate toolboxes. SpecSeg thus provides an efficient and versatile approach for analyzing calcium responses in neuronal structures imaged over prolonged periods of time.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the MAPT gene that encodes tau lead to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with pathology evident in both cerebral neurons and glia. Human cerebral organoids (hCOs) from individuals harboring pathogenic tau mutations can reveal the earliest downstream effects on molecular pathways within a developmental context, generating interacting neurons and glia. We found that in hCOs carrying the V337M and R406W tau mutations, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in astrocytes was the top upregulated gene set compared with isogenic controls by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The 15 upregulated genes included HMGCR, ACAT2, STARD4, LDLR, and SREBF2. This result was confirmed in a homozygous R406W mutant cell line by immunostaining and sterol measurements. Cholesterol abundance in the brain is tightly regulated by efflux and cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme levels in astrocytes, and dysregulation can cause aberrant phosphorylation of tau. Our findings suggest that cholesterol dyshomeostasis is an early event in the etiology of neurodegeneration caused by tau mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes are vital support cells that ensure proper brain function. In brain disease, astrocytes reprogram into a reactive state that alters many of their cellular roles. A long-standing question in the field is whether downregulation of reactive astrocyte (RA) markers during resolution of inflammation is because these astrocytes revert back to a non-reactive state or die and are replaced. This has proven difficult to answer mainly because existing genetic tools cannot distinguish between healthy versus RAs. Here we describe the generation of an inducible genetic tool that can be used to specifically target and label a subset of RAs. Longitudinal analysis of an acute inflammation model using this tool revealed that the previously observed downregulation of RA markers after inflammation is likely due to changes in gene expression and not because of cell death. Our findings suggest that cellular changes associated with astrogliosis after acute inflammation are largely reversible.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental pathogens move from ecological niches to mammalian hosts, requiring adaptation to dramatically different environments. Microbes that disseminate farther, including the fungal meningitis pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, require additional adaptation to diverse tissues. We demonstrate that the formation of a small C. neoformans morphotype—called “seed” cells due to their colonizing ability—is critical for extrapulmonary organ entry. Seed cells exhibit changes in fungal cell size and surface expression that result in an enhanced macrophage update. Seed cell formation is triggered by environmental factors, including C. neoformans’ environmental niche, and pigeon guano with phosphate plays a central role. Seed cells show the enhanced expression of phosphate acquisition genes, and mutants unable to acquire phosphate fail to adopt the seed cell morphotype. Additionally, phosphate can be released by tissue damage, potentially establishing a feed-forward loop of seed cell formation and dissemination. Thus, C. neoformans’ size variation represent inducible morphotypes that change host interactions to facilitate microbe spread.

Abstract: Summary
Diets rich in added sugars are associated with metabolic diseases, and studies have shown a link between these pathologies and changes in the microbiome. Given the reported associations in animal models between the microbiome and brown adipose tissue (BAT) function, and the alterations in the microbiome induced by high-glucose or high-fructose diets, we investigated the potential causal link between high-glucose or -fructose diets and BAT dysfunction in humans. Primary outcomes are changes in BAT cold-induced thermogenesis and the fecal microbiome (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03188835). We show that BAT glucose uptake, but not thermogenesis, is impaired by a high-fructose but not high-glucose diet, in the absence of changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome. We conclude that decreased BAT glucose metabolism occurs earlier than other pathophysiological abnormalities during fructose overconsumption in humans. This is a potential confounding factor for studies relying on 18F-FDG to assess BAT thermogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer, but only a small subset of patients benefits from this new treatment regime. Imaging tools are useful for early detection of tumor response to immunotherapy and probing the dynamic and complex immune system. Here, we report a bioluminescence probe (GBLI-2) for non-invasive, real-time, longitudinal imaging of granzyme B activity in tumors receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. GBLI-2 is made of the mouse granzyme B tetrapeptide IEFD substrate conjugated to D-luciferin through a self-immolative group. GBLI-2 was evaluated for imaging the dynamics of the granzyme B activity and predicting therapeutic efficacy in a syngeneic mouse model of CT26 murine colorectal carcinoma. The GBLI-2 signal correlated with the change in the population of PD-1- and granzyme B-expressing CD8+ T cells in tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota is crucial in the regulation of bile acid (BA) metabolism. However, not much is known about the regulation of BAs during progression to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we analyzed serum and stool BAs in longitudinal samples collected at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age from children who developed a single islet autoantibody (AAb) (P1Ab; n = 23) or multiple islet AAbs (P2Ab; n = 13) and controls (CTRs; n = 38) who remained AAb negative. We also analyzed the stool microbiome in a subgroup of these children. Factor analysis showed that age had the strongest impact on both BA and microbiome profiles. We found that at an early age, systemic BAs and microbial secondary BA pathways were altered in the P2Ab group compared with the P1Ab and CTR groups. Our findings thus suggest that dysregulated BA metabolism in early life may contribute to the risk and pathogenesis of T1D.

Abstract: Background
Oxygen deprivation is a key hallmark within solid tumours that contributes to breast-tumour pathophysiology. Under these conditions, neoplastic cells activate several genes, regulated by the HIF-1 transcription factor, which alters the tumour microenvironment to promote survival – including resistance to cell death in therapeutic attempts such as doxorubicin (Dox) treatment.
Methods
We investigated HIF-1ɑ as a therapeutic target to sensitize breast cancer cells to Dox treatment. Under both normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (∼0.1% O2) conditions, the HIF-1 inhibitor, 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), was investigated as an adjuvant for its ability to alter MCF-7 cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy and molecular pathways which are often associated with increased cell survival.
Results
Here we observed that an inverse relationship between HIF-1ɑ and apoptosis exists and that Dox promotes autophagy under hypoxic conditions. Although adjuvant therapy with 2-ME induced an antagonistic effect in breast cancer cells, upregulated HIF-1ɑ expression in a hypoxic environment promotes treatment resistance and this was attenuated once HIF-1ɑ gene expression was silenced.
Conclusion
Therefore, highlighting the identification of possible hypoxia-targeting therapies for breast cancer patients can be beneficial by promoting more favourable treatment responses.

Abstract: Seven in absentia homolog 1 (Siah1) has been shown plays important roles in the pathogenesis and development of multiple cancers. However, the functions and mechanisms of Siah1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. In our study, we found that knock down of Siah1 could inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells, while over-expression of Siah1 had the opposite effects. Molecularly, the bioinformatics analysis determined that notch receptor 1 (Notch1) might be the potential target of Siah1. Subsequently, we identified that Siah1 acted as an E3 ligase to promote the ubiquitination and stabilization of Notch1 through the proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the results showed that the Siah1 expression was directly correlated with CTR9 in human NSCLC tissues. Finally, Siah1 could promote Akt phosphorylation through regulating Notch1, thus promoting the proliferation of NSCLC cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Siah1 acts as an oncogene, can ubiquitinate and stabilize Notch1 by proteasome pathway, which promotes Akt phosphorylation and ultimately leads to NSCLC cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the IQ calmodulin-binding motif containing B1 (IQCB1)/NPHP5 gene encoding the ciliary protein nephrocystin 5 cause early-onset blinding disease Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), together with kidney dysfunction in Senior-Løken syndrome. For in vitro disease modeling, we obtained dermal fibroblasts from patients with NPHP5-LCA that were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated into retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retinal organoids. Patient fibroblasts and RPE demonstrated aberrantly elongated ciliary axonemes. Organoids revealed impaired development of outer segment structures, which are modified primary cilia, and mislocalization of visual pigments to photoreceptor cell soma. All patient-derived cells showed reduced levels of CEP290 protein, a critical cilia transition zone component interacting with NPHP5, providing a plausible mechanism for aberrant ciliary gating and cargo transport. Disease phenotype in NPHP5-LCA retinal organoids could be rescued by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated IQCB1/NPHP5 gene augmentation therapy. Our studies thus establish a human disease model and a path for treatment of NPHP5-LCA.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms of neutrophil involvement in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain incompletely understood. Here, we collect longitudinal blood samples from 306 hospitalized COVID-19+ patients and 86 controls and perform bulk RNA sequencing of enriched neutrophils, plasma proteomics, and high-throughput antibody profiling to investigate relationships between neutrophil states and disease severity. We identify dynamic switches between six distinct neutrophil subtypes. At days 3 and 7 post-hospitalization, patients with severe disease display a granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like gene expression signature, while patients with resolving disease show a neutrophil progenitor-like signature. Humoral responses are identified as potential drivers of neutrophil effector functions, with elevated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)-to-IgA1 ratios in plasma of severe patients who survived. In vitro experiments confirm that while patient-derived IgG antibodies induce phagocytosis in healthy donor neutrophils, IgA antibodies predominantly induce neutrophil cell death. Overall, our study demonstrates a dysregulated myelopoietic response in severe COVID-19 and a potential role for IgA-dominant responses contributing to mortality.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is a major gynecological tumor worldwide. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms involved in cervical cancer tumorigenesis still requires more clarification. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1), an enzyme involved in phosphatidylcholine metabolism, has been reported to regulate the proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and recurrence of malignancies. Here in our study, we found that LPAT1 was over-expressed in clinical cervical cancer tissues, and its high expression was closely correlated with poor outcomes of patients. We further showed that LPCAT1 knockdown remarkably restrained the proliferation, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells, while it significantly induced apoptosis. RNA-seq and bioinformatics assays initially showed that interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/STAT3) pathway was a key mechanism for LPCAT1 to regulate cervical cancer progression. LPCAT1 silence strongly decreased IL-6, p-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and p-STAT3 expression levels in cervical cancer cells. Similarly, the expression levels of IL-6/STAT3 target genes were also highly down-regulated in cervical cancer cells with LPCAT1 deletion. Importantly, we found that human recombinant IL-6 addition considerably abolished the function of LPCAT1-knockdown to suppress the proliferation and EMT process in cervical cancer cells, accompanied with mitigated apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, our animal experiment results validated that stable LPCAT1 deletion efficiently reduced the tumor growth rates of xenograft mouse models and lung metastasis in vivo. Collectively, all our findings revealed that LPCAT1 may be a promising alternative prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cervical cancer through regulating JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Cigarette smoke exposure increases the production of free radicals leading to initiation of several pathological conditions by triggering the oxidative stress and inflammatory cascade. Olive fruit owing to its unique phytochemical composition possesses antioxidant, immune modulatory, and anti-inflammatory potential. Considering the compositional alterations in olive fruits during ripening, the current experimental trail was designed to investigate the prophylactic role of green and black olives against the oxidative stress induced by cigarette smoke exposure in rats. Purposely, rats were divided into five different groups: NC (negative control; normal diet), PC [positive control; normal diet + smoke exposure (SE)], drug (normal diet + SE + citalopram), GO (normal diet + SE + green olive extract), and BO (normal diet + SE + black olive extract). Rats of all groups were exposed to cigarette smoke except “NC” and were sacrificed for collection of blood and organs after 28 days of experimental trial. The percent reduction in total oxidative stress by citalopram and green and black olive extracts in serum was 29.72, 58.69, and 57.97%, respectively, while the total antioxidant capacity increased by 30.78, 53.94, and 43.98%, accordingly in comparison to PC. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced by 29.63, 42.59, and 45.70% in drug, GO, and BO groups, respectively. Likewise, green and black olive extracts reduced the leakage of hepatic enzymes in sera, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) by 23.44 and 25.80% and 35.62 and 37.61%, alanine transaminase (ALT) by 42.68 and 24.39% and 51.04 and 35.41%, and aspartate transaminase (AST) by 31.51 and 16.07% and 40.50 and 27.09% from PC and drug group, respectively. Additionally, olive extracts also maintained the antioxidant pool, i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione in serum. Furthermore, histological examination revealed that olive extracts prevented the cigarette smoke–induced necrosis, pyknotic alterations, and congestion in the lung, hepatic, and renal parenchyma. Besides, gene expression analysis revealed that olive extracts and citalopram decreased the brain and lung damage caused by stress-induced upregulation of NRF-2 and MAPK signaling pathways. Hence, it can be concluded that olives (both green and black) can act as promising antioxidant in alleviating the cigarette smoke–induced oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Organoids are carrying the promise of modeling complex disease phenotypes and serving as a powerful basis for unbiased drug screens, potentially offering a more efficient drug-discovery route. However, unsolved technical bottlenecks of reproducibility and scalability have prevented the use of current organoids for high-throughput screening. Here, we present a method that overcomes these limitations by using deep-learning-driven analysis for phenotypic drug screens based on highly standardized micropattern-based neural organoids. This allows us to distinguish between disease and wild-type phenotypes in complex tissues with extremely high accuracy as well as quantify two predictors of drug success: efficacy and adverse effects. We applied our approach to Huntington’s disease (HD) and discovered that bromodomain inhibitors revert complex phenotypes induced by the HD mutation. This work demonstrates the power of combining machine learning with phenotypic drug screening and its successful application to reveal a potentially new druggable target for HD.

Abstract: Summary
Plasma cell responses are associated with anti-tumor immunity and favorable response to immunotherapy. B cells can amplify anti-tumor immune responses through antibody production; yet B cells in patients and tumor-bearing mice often fail to support this effector function. We identify dysregulated transcriptional program in B cells that disrupts differentiation of naive B cells into anti-tumor plasma cells. The signaling network contributing to this dysfunction is driven by interleukin (IL) 35 stimulation of a STAT3-PAX5 complex that upregulates the transcriptional regulator BCL6 in naive B cells. Transient inhibition of BCL6 in tumor-educated naive B cells is sufficient to reverse the dysfunction in B cell differentiation, stimulating the intra-tumoral accumulation of plasma cells and effector T cells and rendering pancreatic tumors sensitive to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade. Our findings argue that B cell effector dysfunction in cancer can be due to an active systemic suppression program that can be targeted to synergize with T cell-directed immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The gastrointestinal tract facilitates food digestion, with the gut microbiota playing pivotal roles in nutrient breakdown and absorption. However, the microbial molecules and downstream signaling pathways that activate food digestion remain unexplored. Here, by establishing a food digestion system in C. elegans, we discover that food breakdown is regulated by the interaction between bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and a neural-immune pathway. E. coli OmpF/A activate digestion by increasing the neuropeptide NLP-12 that acts on the receptor CCKR. NLP-12 is homologous to mammalian cholecystokinin, known to stimulate dopamine, and we found that loss of dopamine receptors or addition of a dopamine antagonist inhibited OMP-mediated digestion. Dopamine and NLP-12-CKR-1 converge to inhibit PMK-1/p38 innate immune signaling. Moreover, directly inhibiting PMK-1/p38 boosts food digestion. This study uncovers a role of bacterial OMPs in regulating animal nutrient uptake and supports a key role for innate immunity in digestion.

Abstract: Summary
Inserting large DNA payloads (>10 kb) into specific genomic sites of mammalian cells remains challenging. Applications ranging from synthetic biology to evaluating the pathogenicity of disease-associated variants for precision medicine initiatives would greatly benefit from tools that facilitate this process. Here, we merge the strengths of different classes of site-specific recombinases and combine these with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homologous recombination to develop a strategy for stringent site-specific replacement of genomic fragments at least 50 kb in size in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We demonstrate the versatility of STRAIGHT-IN (serine and tyrosine recombinase-assisted integration of genes for high-throughput investigation) by (1) inserting various combinations of fluorescent reporters into hiPSCs to assess the excitation-contraction coupling cascade in derivative cardiomyocytes and (2) simultaneously targeting multiple variants associated with inherited cardiac arrhythmic disorders into a pool of hiPSCs. STRAIGHT-IN offers a precise approach to generate genetically matched panels of hiPSC lines efficiently and cost effectively.

Abstract: Summary
Large-scale studies of human proteomes have revealed only a moderate correlation between mRNA and protein abundances. It is unclear to what extent this moderate correlation reflects post-transcriptional regulation and to what extent it reflects measurement error. Here, by analyzing replicate profiles of tumors and cell lines, we show that there is considerable variation in the reproducibility of measurements of transcripts and proteins from individual genes. Proteins with more reproducible measurements tend to have a higher mRNA-protein correlation, suggesting that measurement reproducibility accounts for a substantial fraction of the unexplained variation between mRNA and protein abundances. The reproducibility of individual proteins is somewhat consistent across studies, and we exploit this to develop an aggregate reproducibility score that explains a substantial amount of the variation in mRNA-protein correlations across multiple studies. Finally, we show that pathways previously reported to have a higher-than-average mRNA-protein correlation may simply contain members that can be more reproducibly quantified.

Abstract: Summary
Therapies that promote neuroprotection and axonal survival by enhancing myelin regeneration are an unmet need to prevent disability progression in multiple sclerosis. Numerous potentially beneficial compounds have originated from phenotypic screenings but failed in clinical trials. It is apparent that current cell- and animal-based disease models are poor predictors of positive treatment options, arguing for novel experimental approaches. Here we explore the experimental power of humanized zebrafish to foster the identification of pro-remyelination compounds via specific inhibition of GPR17. Using biochemical and imaging techniques, we visualize the expression of zebrafish (zf)-gpr17 during the distinct stages of oligodendrocyte development, thereby demonstrating species-conserved expression between zebrafish and mammals. We also demonstrate species-conserved function of zf-Gpr17 using genetic loss-of-function and rescue techniques. Finally, using GPR17-humanized zebrafish, we provide proof of principle for in vivo analysis of compounds acting via targeted inhibition of human GPR17. We anticipate that GPR17-humanized zebrafish will markedly improve the search for effective pro-myelinating pharmacotherapies.

Abstract: Recently, selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), which bind to AR and act in a tissue/effect-specific manner, have been developed, but the selective mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the selective mechanism using the synthetic steroid YK11, which showed AR-mediated gene-selective transactivation. In the AR-positive human breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells, different patterns of AR-mediated target gene expression and AR recruitment to their enhancer regions were observed between DHT and YK11. A docking study suggested the helices 11 and 12 was moved by the sterically hindered C17-group of YK11. Furthermore, the mutational studies of AR Gln902 and mammalian two-hybrid assays suggested different cofactor recruitment between DHT and YK11. The results of this study suggest that gene selective regulation by SARMs results from differential DNA-binding and/or cofactor recruitment by ligands. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of SARMs.

Abstract: The CCAAT motif-binding factor NF-Y consists of three different subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC. Although it is suggested that NF-Y activity is essential for normal tissue homeostasis, survival, and metabolic function, its precise role in lipid metabolism is not clarified yet. In Drosophila, eye disc specific knockdown of Drosophila NF-YA (dNF-YA) induced aberrant morphology of the compound eye, the rough eye phenotype in adults and mutation of the lipase 4 (lip4) gene suppressed the rough eye phenotype. RNA-seq analyses with dNF-YA knockdown third instar larvae identified the lip4 gene as one of the genes that are up-regulated by the dNF-YA knockdown. We identified three dNF-Y-binding consensuses in the 5′flanking region of the lip4 gene, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with the specific anti-dNF-YA IgG demonstrated dNF-Y binding to this genomic region. The luciferase transient expression assay with cultured Drosophila S2 cells and the lip4 promoter-luciferase fusion genes with and without mutations in the dNF-Y-binding consensuses showed that each of the three dNF-Y consensus sequences negatively regulated lip4 gene promoter activity. Consistent with these results, qRT-PCR analysis with the dNF-YA knockdown third instar larvae revealed that endogenous lip4 mRNA levels were increased by the knockdown of dNF-YA in vivo. The specific knockdown of dNF-YA in the fat body with the collagen-GAL4 driver resulted in smaller oil droplets in the fat body cells. Collectively, these results suggest that dNF-Y is involved in lipid storage through its negative regulation of lip4 gene transcription.

HSP70 protects H9C2 cells from hypoxia and reoxygenation injury through STIM1/IP3R,

Abstract: Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) is used as an in vivo model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia can lead to heart disease. Calcium overload is an important factor in myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury and can lead to apoptosis of myocardial cells. Therefore, it is of great clinical importance to find ways to regulate calcium overload and reduce apoptosis of myocardial cells, and thus alleviate myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. There is evidence that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has a protective effect on the myocardium, but the exact mechanism of this effect is not completely understood. Stromal interaction molecule 1 and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (STIM/1IP3R) play an important role in myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether HSP70 plays an anti-apoptotic role in H9C2 cardiomyocytes by regulating the calcium overload pathway through STIM1/IP3R. Rat H9C2 cells were subjected to transient oxygen and glucose deprivation (incubated in glucose-free medium and hypoxia for 6 h) followed by re-exposure to glucose and reoxygenation (incubated in high glucose medium and reoxygenation for 4 h) to simulate myocardial ischemia reperfusion-induced cell injury. H9C2 cell viability was significantly decreased, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and apoptosis were significantly increased after oxygen and glucose deprivation. Transfection of HSP70 into H9C2 cells could reduce the corresponding effect, increase cell viability and anti-apoptotic signal pathway, and reduce the apoptotic rate and pro-apoptotic signal pathway. After hypoxia and reoxygenation, the expression of STIM1/IP3R and intracellular calcium concentration of HSP70-overexpressed H9C2 cells were significantly lower than those of hypoxia cells. Similarly, direct silencing of STIM1 by siRNA significantly increased cell viability and expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased apoptosis rate and expression of pro-apoptotic protein BAX. These data are consistent with HSP70 overexpression. These results suggest that HSP70 abrogates intracellular calcium overload by inhibiting upregulation of STIM1/IP3R expression, thus reducing apoptosis in H9C2 cells and playing a protective role in cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Effective drugs for atrial fibrillation (AF) are lacking, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This study demonstrates that network proximity analysis of differentially expressed genes from atrial tissue to drug targets can help prioritize repurposed drugs for AF. Using enrichment analysis of drug-gene signatures and functional testing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived atrial-like cardiomyocytes, we identify metformin as a top repurposed drug candidate for AF. Using the active compactor, a new design analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data, we determine that metformin use is significantly associated with a reduced risk of AF (odds ratio = 0.48, 95%, confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.64, p < 0.001) compared with standard treatments for diabetes. This study utilizes network medicine methodologies to identify repurposed drugs for AF treatment and identifies metformin as a candidate drug.

Abstract: Summary
Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) bring a protein of interest (POI) into spatial proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting POI ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. PROTACs rely on endogenous cellular machinery to mediate POI degradation, therefore the subcellular location of the POI and access to the E3 ligase being recruited potentially impacts PROTAC efficacy. To interrogate whether the subcellular context of the POI influences PROTAC-mediated degradation, we expressed either Halo or FKBP12F36V (dTAG) constructs consisting of varying localization signals and tested the efficacy of their degradation by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)- or cereblon (CRBN)-recruiting PROTACs targeting either Halo or dTAG. POIs were localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, outer mitochondrial membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, peroxisome or lysosome. Differentially localized Halo or FKBP12F36V proteins displayed varying levels of degradation using the same respective PROTACs, suggesting therefore that the subcellular context of the POI can influence the efficacy of PROTAC-mediated POI degradation.

Abstract: Summary
A challenge in tuberculosis treatment regimen design is the necessity to combine three or more antibiotics. We narrow the prohibitively large search space by breaking down high-order drug combinations into drug pair units. Using pairwise in vitro measurements, we train machine learning models to predict higher-order combination treatment outcomes in the relapsing BALB/c mouse model. Classifiers perform well and predict many of the >500 possible combinations among 12 antibiotics to be improved over bedaquiline + pretomanid + linezolid, a treatment-shortening regimen compared with the standard of care in mice. We reformulate classifiers as simple rulesets to reveal guiding principles of constructing combination therapies for both preclinical and clinical outcomes. One example ruleset combines a drug pair that is synergistic in a dormancy model with a pair that is potent in a cholesterol-rich growth environment. These rulesets are predictive, intuitive, and practical, thus enabling rational construction of drug combinations.

Abstract: Summary
Image reconstruction by integrating exchangeable single-molecule localization (IRIS) achieves multiplexed super-resolution imaging by high-density labeling with fast exchangeable fluorescent probes. However, previous methods to develop probes for individual targets required a great amount of time and effort. Here, we introduce a method for generating recombinant IRIS probes with a new mutagenesis strategy that can be widely applied to existing antibody sequences. Several conserved tyrosine residues at the base of complementarity-determining regions were identified as candidate sites for site-directed mutagenesis. With a high probability, mutations at candidate sites accelerated the off rate of recombinant antibody-based probes without compromising specific binding. We were able to develop IRIS probes from five monoclonal antibodies and three single-domain antibodies. We demonstrate multiplexed localization of endogenous proteins in primary neurons that visualizes small synaptic connections with high binding density. It is now practically feasible to generate fast-dissociating fluorescent probes for multitarget super-resolution imaging.

Abstract: Actin has important functions in both cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell, with active nuclear transport mechanisms maintaining the cellular actin balance. Nuclear actin levels are subject to regulation during many cellular processes from cell differentiation to cancer. Here we show that nuclear actin levels increase upon differentiation of PC6.3 cells towards neuron-like cells. Photobleaching experiments demonstrate that this increase is due to decreased nuclear export of actin during cell differentiation. Increased nuclear actin levels lead to decreased nuclear localization of MRTF-A, a well-established transcription cofactor of SRF. In line with MRTF-A localization, transcriptomics analysis reveals that MRTF/SRF target gene expression is first transiently activated, but then substantially downregulated during PC6.3 cell differentiation. This study therefore describes a novel cellular context, where regulation of nuclear actin is utilized to tune MRTF/SRF target gene expression during cell differentiation.

Abstract: Acute renal damage presents a significant danger to kidney health. Previous research has found that acute kidney injury shows high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation caused by sepsis. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can repair acute kidney injury. However, involvement of MSCs exosomes generated from adipose tissue and bone marrow in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute kidney damage is not clear. LPS (7.5 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injection was used to produce AKI, and 30 min before the LPS administration, adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs) exosomes (1 × 105 and 5 × 105) and bone marrow-derived MSCs(BMSCs) exosomes (1 × 105 and 5 × 105) were delivered individually. The function of the rat kidney was explored. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy levels were further investigated. Both adipose-derived and bone marrow-derived MSCs can enhance renal function and structural damage, such as BUN, Creatinine, and cystatin C levels, as well as tubular damage scores. These findings indicate that both adipose-derived MSCs exosomes and bone marrow-derived MSCs exosomes decrease oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as make a substantial influence on kidney tissue in autophagy levels. Furthermore, compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs exosomes, adipose-derived MSCs exosomes improved kidney function and structure more significantly. We discovered that adipose-derived MSCs exosomes protect against LPS-induced AKI by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid antigen tests in the form of lateral flow devices (LFDs) allow testing of a large population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To reduce the variability in device interpretation, we show the design and testing of an artifical intelligence (AI) algorithm based on machine learning. The machine learning (ML) algorithm is trained on a combination of artificially hybridized LFDs and LFD data linked to quantitative real-time PCR results. Participants are recruited from assisted test sites (ATSs) and health care workers undertaking self-testing, and images are analyzed using the ML algorithm. A panel of trained clinicians is used to resolve discrepancies. In total, 115,316 images are returned. In the ATS substudy, sensitivity increased from 92.08% to 97.6% and specificity from 99.85% to 99.99%. In the self-read substudy, sensitivity increased from 16.00% to 100% and specificity from 99.15% to 99.40%. An ML-based classifier of LFD results outperforms human reads in assisted testing sites and self-reading.

Abstract: The diabetic cognitive impairments are associated with high-glucose (HG)-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in the brain. Our previous studies demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-MEG3 alleviates diabetic cognitive impairments. However, the underlying mechanism has still remained elusive. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate whether the mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A and its phosphorylation are involved in lncRNA-MEG3-mediated neuroprotective effects of mitochondrial functions in HG-treated primary hippocampal neurons and diabetic rats. The primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 75 mM glucose for 72 h to establish a HG model in vitro. Firstly, the RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays clearly indicated that lncRNA-MEG3-associated mitochondrial proteins were Annexin A2, HSP90A, and Plectin. Although HG promoted the mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A and Annexin A2, lncRNA-MEG3 over-expression only enhanced the mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A, rather than Annexin A2, in the primary hippocampal neurons treated with or without HG. Meanwhile, Plectin mediated the mitochondrial localization of lncRNA-MEG3 and HSP90A. Furthermore, HSP90A threonine phosphorylation participated in regulating mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A, and lncRNA-MEG3 also enhanced mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A through suppressing HSP90A threonine phosphorylation. Finally, the anti-apoptotic role of mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A was found to be associated with inhibiting death receptor 5 (DR5) in HG-treated primary hippocampal neurons and diabetic rats. Taken together, lncRNA-MEG3 could improve mitochondrial functions in HG-exposed primary hippocampal neurons, and the underlying mechanisms were involved in enhanced mitochondrial translocation of HSP90A via suppressing HSP90A threonine phosphorylation, which may reveal a potential therapeutic target for diabetic cognitive impairments.

Abstract: Summary
As COVID-19 cases exceed hundreds of millions globally, many survivors face cognitive challenges and prolonged symptoms. However, important questions about the cognitive effects of COVID-19 remain unresolved. In this cross-sectional online study, 478 adult volunteers who self-reported a positive test for COVID-19 (mean = 30 days since most recent test) perform significantly worse than pre-pandemic norms on cognitive measures of processing speed, reasoning, verbal, and overall performance, but not short-term memory, suggesting domain-specific deficits. Cognitive differences are even observed in participants who did not require hospitalization. Factor analysis of health- and COVID-related questionnaires reveals two clusters of symptoms—one that varies mostly with physical symptoms and illness severity, and one with mental health. Cognitive performance is positively correlated with the global measure encompassing physical symptoms, but not the one that broadly describes mental health, suggesting that the subjective experience of “long COVID” relates to physical symptoms and cognitive deficits, especially executive dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Emergency hematopoiesis involves the activation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in response to systemic inflammation by a combination of cell-autonomous and stroma-dependent signals and leads to their release from bone marrow and migration to periphery. We have previously shown that FZD6 plays a pivotal role in regulating HSPC expansion and long-term maintenance. Now we sought to better understand the underlying mechanisms. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced emergency granulopoiesis as a model, we show that failed expansion was intrinsic to FZD6-deficient HSPCs but also required a FZD6-deficient environment. FZD6-deficient HSPCs became more strongly activated, but their mobilization to peripheral blood was impaired and they were more susceptible to inflammatory cell death, leading to enhanced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the marrow. These studies indicate that FZD6 has a protective effect in the bone marrow to prevent an overactive inflammatory response and further suggest that mobilization improves HSPC survival during bone marrow inflammation.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common intracranial primary tumor of the central nervous system with high malignancy, poor prognosis, and short survival. Studies have shown that mitochondrial energy metabolism plays an important role in GBM chemotherapy resistance, suggesting that interrupting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) may improve GBM treatment. Human peptide deformylase (HsPDF) is a mitochondrial deformylase that removes the formylated methionine from the N-terminus of proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), thereby contributing to correct protein folding and participating in the assembly of the electron respiratory chain complex. In this study, we found that the expression of mtDNA-encoded proteins was significantly downregulated after treatment of GBM cells U87MG and LN229 with the HsPDF inhibitor, actinonin. In combination with temozolomide, a preferred chemotherapeutic medicine for GBM, the OXPHOS level decreased, mitochondrial protein homeostasis was unbalanced, mitochondrial fission increased, and the integrated stress response was activated to promote mitochondrial apoptosis. These findings suggest that HsPDF inhibition is an important strategy for overcoming chemoresistance of GBM cells.

Abstract: Decreased estrogen levels in menopause are associated with anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory impairments, predisposing women to cardiometabolic risk factors such as diabetes. Menopause and type two diabetes (DM2) are marked by altered heat shock response (HSR), shown by decreased expression of the 70-kDa heat shock protein in the intracellular milieu (iHSP70). While iHSP70 plays an anti-inflammatory role, extracellular HSP70 (eHSP70) may mediate pro-inflammatory pathways and has been associated with insulin resistance in DM2. Considering the roles of these proteins according to localization, the eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio (H-index) has been proposed as a biomarker for HSR. We, therefore, evaluated whether this biomarker is associated with glycemic and inflammatory status in postmenopausal women. In this transversal study, 36 postmenopausal women were grouped according to fasting glycemia status as either the control group (normoglycemic, ≤ 99 mg/dL) or DM2 (prediabetic and diabetic, glycemia ≥ 100 mg/dL). DM2 group showed higher triglyceride/glucose (TyG) index and plasma atherogenic index (PAI), both of which are indicators of cardiometabolic risk. In addition, we found that the eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio (plasma/peripheral blood mononuclear cells–PBMC ratio) was higher in the DM2 group, compared with the control group. Furthermore, blood leukocyte and glycemia levels were positively correlated with the eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio in women that presented H-index values above 1.0 (a.u.). Taken together, our results highlight the eHSP70-to-iHSP70 ratio as a biomarker of altered HSR in DM2 postmenopausal women.

Abstract: Summary
Interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2 (IMPG2) mutations cause a severe form of early-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP) with macular involvement. IMPG2 is expressed by photoreceptors and incorporated into the matrix that surrounds the inner and outer segments (OS) of rods and cones, but the mechanism of IMPG2-RP remains unclear. Loss of Impg2 function in mice produces a mild, late-onset photoreceptor phenotype without the characteristic OS loss that occurs in human patients. We generated retinal organoids (ROs) from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and gene-edited embryonic stem cells to model human IMPG2-RP in vitro. All ROs harboring IMPG2 mutations lacked an OS layer, in contrast to isogenic controls. Subsequent protein analyses revealed that this phenotype arises due to a loss of IMPG2 expression or its inability to undergo normal post-translational modifications. We hypothesized that loss of IMPG2 function destabilizes the interphotoreceptor matrix and renders the OS vulnerable to physical stressors, which is accentuated in the tissue culture environment. In support of this mechanism, transplantation of IMPG2 mutant ROs into the protected subretinal space of immunocompromised rodents restored OS production. Beyond providing a robust platform to study IMPG2-RP, this human RO model system may serve a broader role in honing strategies to treat advanced photoreceptor-based diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The development of a chemically attenuated, replication-incompetent virus vaccine can provide protection against diseases caused by DNA viruses. In this study, we have developed a method to produce live-attenuated, replication-defective viruses using centanamycin (CM), a chemical compound that alkylates the A-T-rich minor groove of the DNA and thereby blocks DNA replication. We tested the efficacy of CM to produce live-attenuated, replication-defective human cytomegalovirus, mouse cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), suggesting a broad application for generating live-attenuated, replication-defective DNA viruses. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that CM alkylate viral DNA at the adenine-N3 position. Moreover, mice immunization with CM-attenuated mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) produced a robust immune response and reduced the viral load in immunized animals against challenges with live, wild-type MCMV. Our study offers a unifying and attractive therapeutic opportunity that chemically attenuated live DNA viruses can be readily developed as new frontline vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an insidious and lethal vascular disease that lacks effective nonsurgical interventions. Gut microbiota dysbiosis plays key roles in many diseases, but its relationship with AAA has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we reveal significant abnormalities in the gut microbe composition of AAA patients and confirm that gut microbiota dysbiosis is an important cause of AAA. Specifically, R. intestinalis was significantly reduced in AAA patients. Using AAA mice, we show that R. intestinalis and its metabolite butyrate significantly reduce neutrophil infiltration and NOX2-dependent neutrophil extracellular trap formation, inflammation, and abnormal phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells in the aortic wall, thereby markedly alleviating AAA development. Our research uncovers the role and mechanism of the gut microbiota in AAA development and provides insights into AAA prophylaxis from a microecological perspective.

Abstract: Summary
Liver damage and an exacerbated inflammatory response are hallmarks of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Little is known about the intrinsic response to infection in human hepatocytes and their contribution to inflammation. Here, we present an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cell (HLC) platform to define the hepato-intrinsic response to EBOV infection. We used this platform to show robust EBOV infection, with characteristic ultrastructural changes and evidence for viral replication. Transcriptomics analysis revealed a delayed response with minimal early transcriptomic changes, followed by a general downregulation of hepatic function and upregulation of interferon signaling, providing a potential mechanism by which hepatocytes participate in disease severity and liver damage. Using RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we showed that IFNB1 and CXCL10 were mainly expressed in non-infected bystander cells. We did not observe an inflammatory signature during infection. In conclusion, iPSC-HLCs are an immune competent platform to study responses to EBOV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) is a common feature of many pre-clinical models of neurological disorders; however, studies in humans are limited by the inaccessibility of the brain. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a unique opportunity to study LTP in disease-specific genetic backgrounds. Here we describe a multi-electrode array (MEA)-based assay to investigate chemically induced LTP (cLTP) across entire networks of hiPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic (DA) and cortical neuronal populations that lasts for days, allowing studies of the late phases of LTP and enabling detection of associated molecular changes. We show that cLTP on midbrain DA neuronal networks is largely independent of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and partially dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Finally, we describe activity-regulated gene expression induced by cLTP. This cLTP-MEA assay platform will enable phenotype discovery and higher-throughput analyses of synaptic plasticity on hiPSC-derived neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Endometrial cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed gynecological cancers worldwide, and its prevalence has increased by more than 50% over the last two decades. Despite the understanding of the major signaling pathways driving the growth and metastasis of endometrial cancer, clinical trials targeting these signals have reported poor outcomes. The heterogeneous nature of endometrial cancer is suspected to be one of the key reasons for the failure of targeted therapies. In this study, we perform a sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH)-based comparative proteomic analysis of 63 tumor biopsies collected from 20 patients and define differences in protein signature in multiple regions of the same tumor. We develop organoids from multiple biopsies collected from the same tumor and show that organoids capture heterogeneity in endometrial cancer growth. Overall, using quantitative proteomics and patient-derived organoids, we define the heterogeneous nature of endometrial cancer within a patient’s tumor.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-like modifier 1 ligating enzyme 1 (UFL1) is a unique E3 ligase of the UFMylation system. Recent studies have shown that this enzyme plays a crucial role in the processes of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and apoptosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can cause injury to ovarian granule cells and hinder follicular development by triggering ER stress and apoptosis. Our study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which UFL1 alleviates ER stress and apoptosis caused by LPS in human granulosa-like cells (KGNs). In this study, we found that the protein levels of UFL1 were increased obviously under LPS stimulation in KGNs and that ER stress and apoptosis were further aggravated when UFL1 was knocked down; in contrast, these events were rescued when UFL1 was overexpressed. Next, we showed that the levels of ferroptosis-related proteins were relatively altered, accompanied by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Fe2+, following the inhibition of UFL1 expression. In contrast, the overexpression of UFL1 reversed the ferroptosis process by regulating the P53/SLC7A11 (solute carrier family 7, member 11, SLC7A11) system and autophagy in response to LPS stimulation. Furthermore, apoptosis and ER stress in KGNs are rescued by the administration of the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Collectively, our research demonstrated a new mechanism for UFL1 that can alleviate ER stress and apoptosis stimulated by LPS; this occurred via the regulation of the ferroptosis pathway in KGNs and may provide a new strategy for research in the field of reproduction.

Abstract: Summary
Although the MAPK pathway is aberrantly activated in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), the clinical outcome of MEK-targeted therapy is still poor. Through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 library screening, we find that inhibition of PSMG2 sensitizes TNBC cells BT549 and MB468 to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244. Mechanistically, PSMG2 knockdown impairs proteasome function, which in turn activates autophagy-mediated PDPK1 degradation. The PDPK1 degradation significantly enhances AZD6244-induced tumor cell growth inhibition by interrupting the negative feedback signals toward the AKT pathway. Consistently, co-targeting proteasomes and MEK with inhibitors synergistically suppresses tumor cell growth. The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine partially relieves the PDPK1 degradation and reverses the growth inhibition induced by combinatorial inhibition of MEK and proteasome. The combination regimen with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 plus AZD6244 synergistically inhibits tumor growth in a 4T1 xenograft mouse model. In summary, our study not only unravels the mechanism of MEK inhibitor resistance but also provides a combinatorial therapeutic strategy for TNBC in clinics.

Abstract: Summary
The high number of mutations in the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes its immune escape. We report a longitudinal analysis of 111 vaccinated individuals for their antibody levels up to 6 months after the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. After the third dose, the antibody levels decline but less than after the second dose. The booster dose remarkably increases the serum ability to block wild-type or Omicron variant spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and these protective antibodies persist 3 months later. Three months after the booster dose, memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the wild-type and Omicron variant are detectable in the majority of vaccinated individuals. Our data show that the third dose restores the high levels of blocking antibodies and enhances T cell responses to Omicron.

Abstract: Introduction
The role of different isoforms of Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) in tubular epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in diabetic nephropathy remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the role of FGF2 isoforms in the pathogenesis of EMT.
Materials and methods
Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to assess the expression of FGF2 isoforms in db/db mice and high glucose-stimulated HK2 cells. The effects of specific FGF2 isoforms on EMT were explored via overexpression or knockdown of the corresponding isoform in HK2 cells cultivated in high glucose.
Results
Expression of low molecular weight (LMW) FGF2 was up-regulated while high molecular weight (HMW) FGF2 was down-regulated in the kidney of db/db mice and HK2 cells cultured in high glucose that underwent EMT. Overexpression of the LMW FGF2 enhanced EMT changes, while overexpression of the HMW FGF2 attenuated EMT. Knockdown of HMW FGF2 in HK2 cells promoted the EMT process.
Conclusions
The expression and function of LMW and HMW FGF2 differed in the process of EMT in tubular cells. LMW FGF2 contributed to EMT, while HMW FGF2 played a protective role in the EMT process.

Abstract: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a common and unavoidable pathophysiological process during liver transplantation or resection operation, may impede postoperative liver function recovery, and its mechanism and targeted therapy remain largely unknown. SIRT5 is a well-known deacetylase and participates in the regulation of many physiological and pathological processes, including I/R. The role of SIRT5 in I/R is controversial or tissue-specific, restricting I/R progression in the heart while deteriorating injury in the kidney and brain, while its effect on hepatic I/R remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the function of SIRT5 in hepatic I/R using AAV8 and lentivirus to overexpress SIRT5 in vivo and in vitro. The data showed that SIRT5 overexpression alleviated liver I/R injury in mice and hypoxia/reoxygenation treated AML-12 cells. Moreover, gain- and loss-of-function of SIRT5, SOD1 and IDH2 experiments in AML-12 were performed. Our results demonstrated that SOD1 and IDH2 knockdown abolished the effect of SIRT5 on restraining oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, our work revealed that SIRT5 may alleviates hepatic I/R injury by diminishing oxidative stress and inflammation via up-regulating the SOD1 and IDH2 expression, which enriches the theory and therapeutic strategies of hepatic I/R injury.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular quiescence facilitates maintenance of neural stem cells (NSCs) and their subsequent regenerative functions in response to brain injury and aging. However, the specification and maintenance of NSCs in quiescence from embryo to adulthood remain largely unclear. Here, using Set domain-containing protein 4 (SETD4), an epigenetic determinant of cellular quiescence, we mark a small but long-lived NSC population in deep quiescence in the subventricular zone of adult murine brain. Genetic lineage tracing shows that SETD4+ cells appear before neuroectoderm formation and contribute to brain development. In the adult, conditional knockout of Setd4 resulted in quiescence exit of NSCs, generating newborn neurons in the olfactory bulb and contributing to damage repair. However, long period deletion of SETD4 lead to exhaustion of NSC reservoir or SETD4 overexpression caused quiescence entry of NSCs, leading to suppressed neurogenesis. This study reveals the existence of long-lived deep quiescent NSCs and their neurogenetic capacities beyond activation.

Abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant and well-studied internal modification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Although m6A mRNA modification has been frequently observed in osteosarcoma, the roles and underlying mechanisms of m6A modification are not yet fully elucidated. In this study, an m6A regulator, METTL3, showed to be dramatically up-regulated within osteosarcoma tissues and cells than non-cancerous healthy samples and human normal osteoblasts, respectively. In vitro, knockdown of METTL3 suppressed the viability of osteosarcomas, and their abilities to migrate and invade; in vivo, knockdown of METTL3 repressed tumor growth within xenotransplant tumor model. METTL3 upregulates COPS5 expression may be through promoting COPS5 methylation to stabilize COPS5 mRNA. The expression level of COPS5 also showed to be up-regulated within osteosarcoma tissue samples and cells. COPS5 knockdown caused no changes in METTL3 effects on METTL3 expression but partially eliminated METTL3 effects on COPS5 expression. METTL3 overexpression promoted, whereas COPS5 knockdown inhibited the malignant behaviors of osteosarcoma cells; COPS5 knockdown partially eliminated the effects of METTL3 overexpression on osteosarcoma cells. Conclusively, METTL3 and COPS5 serve as oncogenic regulators in osteosarcoma. METTL3 upregulates COPS5 expression in osteosarcoma in an m6A-related manner.

Abstract: Delivery of exogenous heat shock protein 90α (Hsp90α) and/or its induced expression in neural tissues has been suggested as a potential strategy to combat neurodegenerative disease. However, within a neurodegenerative context, a pro-inflammatory response to extracellular Hsp90α (eHsp90α) could undermine strategies to use it for therapeutic intervention. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological effects of eHsp90α on microglial cells, the primary mediators of inflammatory responses in the brain. Transcriptomic profiling by RNA-seq of primary microglia and the cultured EOC2 microglial cell line treated with eHsp90α showed the chaperone to stimulate activation of innate immune responses in microglia that were characterized by an increase in NF-kB-regulated genes. Further characterization showed this response to be substantially lower in amplitude than the effects of other inflammatory stimuli such as fibrillar amyloid-β (fAβ) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Additionally, the toxicity of conditioned media obtained from microglia treated with fAβ was attenuated by addition of eHsp90α. Using a co-culture system of microglia and hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 cells separated by a chamber insert, the neurotoxicity of medium conditioned by microglia treated with fAβ was reduced when eHsp90α was also added. Mechanistically, eHsp90α was shown to activate Nrf2, a response which attenuated fAβ-induced nitric oxide production. The data thus suggested that eHsp90α protects against fAβ-induced oxidative stress. We also report eHsp90α to induce expression of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (Marco), which would permit receptor-mediated endocytosis of fAβ.

Abstract: Summary
Telencephalic organoids generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a promising system for studying the distinct features of the developing human brain and the underlying causes of many neurological disorders. While organoid technology is steadily advancing, many challenges remain, including potential batch-to-batch and cell-line-to-cell-line variability, and structural inconsistency. Here, we demonstrate that a major contributor to cortical organoid quality is the way hPSCs are maintained prior to differentiation. Optimal results were achieved using particular fibroblast-feeder-supported hPSCs rather than feeder-independent cells, differences that were reflected in their transcriptomic states at the outset. Feeder-supported hPSCs displayed activation of diverse transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily signaling pathways and increased expression of genes connected to naive pluripotency. We further identified combinations of TGFβ-related growth factors that are necessary and together sufficient to impart broad telencephalic organoid competency to feeder-free hPSCs and enhance the formation of well-structured brain tissues suitable for disease modeling.

Abstract: Summary
Local or metastatic relapse following surgery, radiotherapy, and cisplatin is the leading cause of death in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Our study shows overexpression of c-MET and AXL in HNSCC cells and patients resistant to radiotherapy and cisplatin. We demonstrate that cabozantinib, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), c-MET, and AXL, decreases migration, invasion, and proliferation and induces mitotic catastrophe and apoptotic cell death of naive and radiotherapy- and cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells. Cabozantinib inhibits the growth and metastatic spread of experimental HNSCC in zebrafish and the growth of experimental HNSCC in mice by blocking tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The efficacy of cabozantinib is also confirmed on viable sections of surgically removed specimens of human HNSCC and on a patient who relapses after five lines of treatment. These results suggest that cabozantinib is relevant for the treatment of patients with HNSCC after relapse under radiotherapy and cisplatin.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining corneal health and transparency are necessary pre-requisites for exquisite vision, a function ascribed to stem cells (SCs) nestled within the limbus. Perturbations to this site or depletion of its SCs results in limbal SC deficiency. While characterizing a murine model of this disease, we discovered unusual transformation phenomena on the corneal surface including goblet cell metaplasia (GCM), conjunctival transdifferentiation, and squamous metaplasia (SQM). GCM arose from K8+ differentiated conjunctival epithelial cells when the limbus was breached and was exacerbated by neovascularization. Regions within the cornea that harbored newly transformed K12+ epithelia were void of blood vessels and GCs, suggesting that the cornea also initiated a self-repair program. Knowledge of the intrinsic circuits that contribute to cell identity change in lineage-restricted epithelia will be invaluable for designing new therapeutics for patients with blinding corneal disease.

Abstract: Background
Small Extracellular vesicles (EV) are emerging as crucial intercellular messengers that contribute to the physiological processes. EVs contain numerous functional proteins and nucleic acids derived from their parent cells and have different roles depending on their origin. Functionally, EVs transfer these biological materials from the parent cell to the recipient and thus exhibits a novel therapeutic platform for delivering therapeutics molecules to the target tissue. In this regard, EVs derived from stem cells such as Mesenchymal Stem Cells and iPSCs have demonstrated a higher ability to benefit regenerative medicine. Even though these stem cells share some common properties, due to the differences in their origin (cell sources, the hierarchy of potency, etc) the EVs cargo profiling and functionality may vary.
Method
We used iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis to conduct a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of EVs derived from iPSCs and various tissue-specific MSCs in this study. Additionally, the data was analyzed using a variety of bioinformatic tools, including ProteinPilot for peptide and protein identification and quantification; Funrich, GO, Reactome, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) for pathway enrichment; the STRING database, and the inBio Discover tool for identifying known and predicted Protein-Protein networks.
Results
Bioinformatics analysis revealed 223 differentially expressed proteins in these EVs; however, Wharton's jelly MSC-EV contained more exclusive proteins with higher protein expression levels. Additionally, 113 proteins were abundant in MSC-EVs, while others were shared between MSC-EVs and iPSC-EVs. Further, based on an in-depth examination of the proteins, their associated pathways, and their interactions with other proteins, it was determined that these proteins are involved in bone regeneration (9.3%), wound healing (4.4%), immune regulation (8.9%), cardiac regeneration (6.6%), neuro regeneration (8.9%), and hepatic regeneration (3.5%).
Conclusion
Overall, the results of our proteomic analysis indicate that EVs derived from MSCs have a more robust profile of proteins with higher expression levels than iPSCs. This is a significant finding, as it demonstrates the critical therapeutic role of EVs in a variety of diseases, as demonstrated by enrichment analysis, their versatility, and broad application potential.

Abstract: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common nerve disorder of diabetes. The aim of this study was to explore the protective effects of tropisetron in DPN. Type 1 diabetes was created by a single injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, ip). Tropisetron (3 mg/kg, ip) was administered daily for 2 weeks. Our analysis showed that nerve fibers and their myelin sheaths were thinned with decreased myelinated fiber number in diabetic animals. The intensity of Bcl-2 staining decreased and the intensity of Bax staining increased in the sciatic nerves of diabetic rats by using immunohistochemical staining. Furthermore, diabetes significantly increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1-β (TNFα and IL-1β) and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in sciatic nerves of rats. However, intraperitoneal injection of tropisetron significantly reversed these alterations induced by diabetes. These findings suggest that tropisetron attenuates diabetes-induced peripheral nerve injury through its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, and may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the process of peripheral neuropathy in diabetes.

Abstract: Bcl-rambo, also known as BCL2L13, has been reported to regulate apoptosis, mitochondrial fragmentation, and mitophagy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Bcl-rambo regulates these processes currently remain unclear. In the present study, we identified phosphoglycerate mutase member 5 (PGAM5) as an emerging partner interacting with Bcl-rambo through phenotypic Drosophila screening. The rough eye phenotype induced by human Bcl-rambo was partly rescued by the knockdown of pgam5-2, a mammalian ortholog of PGAM5. Bcl-rambo bound to PGAM5, and their interaction required the Bcl-rambo transmembrane domain. The co-expression of Bcl-rambo and PGAM5 promoted effector caspase activity in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. The transient overexpression of Bcl-rambo increased LC3B-II levels, which had been decreased by the co-expression of PGAM5. These results suggest that PGAM5 promotes Bcl-rambo-dependent apoptosis, but conversely interferes with Bcl-rambo-dependent mitophagy.

Abstract: Summary
In complex diseases, the phenotypic variability can be explained by genetic variation (G), environmental stimuli (E), and interaction of genetic and environmental factors (G-by-E effects), among which the contribution G-by-E remains largely unknown. In this study, we focus on ten major neuropsychiatric disorders using data for 138,383 United States families with 404,475 unique individuals. We show that, while gene-environment interactions account for only a small portion of the total phenotypic variance for a subset of disorders (depression, adjustment disorder, substance abuse), they explain a rather large portion of the phenotypic variation of the remaining disorders: over 20% for migraine and close to or over 30% for anxiety/phobic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, recurrent headaches, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In this study, we have incorporated—in the same analysis—clinical data, family pedigrees, the spatial distribution of individuals, their socioeconomic and demographic confounders, and a collection of environmental measurements.

Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus causes subclinical mastitis; lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from S. aureus causes mastitis-like adverse effects on milk production by mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Here, we investigated the early effects of LTA from S. aureus on mouse MECs using a culture model, in which MECs produced milk components and formed less permeable tight junctions (TJs). In MECs of this model, Toll-like receptor 2 (receptor for LTA), was localized on the apical membrane, similar to MECs in lactating mammary glands. LTA weakened the TJ barrier within 1 h, concurrently with localization changes of claudin 4. LTA treatment for 24 h increased αS1-casein and decreased β-casein levels. In MECs exposed to LTA, the activation level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (major transcriptional factor for milk production) was low. LTA activated signaling pathways related to cell survival (extracellular signal‐regulated kinase, heat shock protein 27, and Akt) and inflammation (p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and nuclear factor κB). Thus, LTA caused abnormalities in casein production and weakened the TJs by affecting multiple signaling pathways in MECs. LTA-induced changes in signaling pathways were not uniform in all MECs. Such complex and semi-negative actions of LTA may contribute to subclinical mastitis caused by S. aureus.

Abstract: Summary
Combining multiple Parkinson's disease (PD) relevant cellular phenotypes might increase the accuracy of midbrain dopaminergic neuron (mDAN) in vitro models. We differentiated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a LRRK2 G2019S mutation, isogenic control, and genetically unrelated iPSCs into mDANs. Using automated fluorescence microscopy in 384-well-plate format, we identified elevated levels of α-synuclein (αSyn) and serine 129 phosphorylation, reduced dendritic complexity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Next, we measured additional image-based phenotypes and used machine learning (ML) to accurately classify mDANs according to their genotype. Additionally, we show that chemical compound treatments, targeting LRRK2 kinase activity or αSyn levels, are detectable when using ML classification based on multiple image-based phenotypes. We validated our approach using a second isogenic patient-derived SNCA gene triplication mDAN model which overexpresses αSyn. This phenotyping and classification strategy improves the practical exploitability of mDANs for disease modeling and the identification of novel LRRK2-associated drug targets.

Abstract: Summary
Proteases are attractive targets for infectious disease diagnostics. Peptide-based sensors that are cleaved by pathogen proteases can provide a rapid readout of infection. However, identifying peptide substrates specific to a targeted pathogen is a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that a structured propeptide domain from a bacterial protease can be repurposed as a protease-activated biosensor of the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae. We found that the peptidase inhibitor I9 domain of the secreted V. cholerae protease IvaP is rapidly degraded by V. cholerae, but not by other intestinal bacteria. By conjugating the I9 domain to an environment-sensitive fluorophore, we developed a fluorescent probe that enables the species-specific detection of V. cholerae in mixed bacterial cultures without nonspecific cleavage by other bacteria or intestinal cells. Our findings demonstrate that the IvaP propeptide is sufficient to impart selectivity to a cleavage-based V. cholerae biosensor, suggesting I9 domains could potentially be harnessed for diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide opportunities for cell replacement therapy of insulin-dependent diabetes. Therapeutic quantities of human stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) can be produced by directed differentiation. However, preventing allo-rejection and recurring autoimmunity, without the use of encapsulation or systemic immunosuppressants, remains a challenge. An attractive approach is to transplant SC-islets, genetically modified to reduce the impact of immune rejection. To determine the underlying forces that drive immunogenicity of SC-islets in inflammatory environments, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and whole-genome CRISPR screen of SC-islets under immune interaction with allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Data analysis points to “alarmed” populations of SC-islets that upregulate genes in the interferon (IFN) pathway. The CRISPR screen in vivo confirms that targeting IFNγ-induced mediators has beneficial effects on SC-islet survival under immune attack. Manipulating the IFN response by depleting chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) in SC-islet grafts confers improved survival against allo-rejection compared with wild-type grafts in humanized mice. These results offer insights into the nature of immune destruction of SC-islets during allogeneic responses and provide targets for gene editing.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health concern. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions may be targeted to prevent the progress of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Sulforaphane (SFN), a sulfur-containing compound that is abundant in broccoli florets, seeds, and sprouts, has been reported to have beneficial effects on attenuating metabolic diseases. In light of this, the present study was designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which SFN ameliorated ER stress, inflammation, lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance — induced by a high-fat diet and ionizing radiation (IR) in rats. In our study, the rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, HFD, HFD + SFN, HFD + IR, and HFD + IR + SFN groups. After the last administration of SFN, liver and blood samples were taken. As a result, the lipid profile, liver enzymes, glucose, insulin, IL-1β, adipokines (leptin and resistin), and PI3K/AKT protein levels, as well as the mRNA gene expression of ER stress markers (IRE-1, sXBP-1, PERK, ATF4, and CHOP), fatty acid synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). Interestingly, SFN treatment modulated the levels of proinflammatory cytokine including IL-1β, metabolic indices (lipid profile, glucose, insulin, and adipokines), and ER stress markers in HFD and HFD + IR groups. SFN also increases the expression of PPAR-α and AMPK genes in the livers of HFD and HFD + IR groups. Meanwhile, the gene expression of FAS and CHOP was significantly attenuated in the SFN-treated groups. Our results clearly show that SFN inhibits liver toxicity induced by HFD and IR by ameliorating the ER stress events in the liver tissue through the upregulation of AMPK and PPAR-α accompanied by downregulation of FAS and CHOP gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Analogs of the incretin hormones Gip and Glp-1 are used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. Findings in experimental models suggest that manipulating several hormones simultaneously may be more effective. To identify small molecules that increase the number of incretin-expressing cells, we established a high-throughput in vivo chemical screen by using the gip promoter to drive the expression of luciferase in zebrafish. All hits increased the numbers of neurogenin 3-expressing enteroendocrine progenitors, Gip-expressing K-cells, and Glp-1-expressing L-cells. One of the hits, a dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) inhibitor, additionally decreased glucose levels in both larval and juvenile fish. Knock-down experiments indicated that nfatc4, a downstream mediator of DYRKs, regulates incretin+ cell number in zebrafish, and that Dyrk1b regulates Glp-1 expression in an enteroendocrine cell line. DYRK inhibition also increased the number of incretin-expressing cells in diabetic mice, suggesting a conserved reinforcement of the enteroendocrine system, with possible implications for diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of sexually transmitted bacterial infections and a major threat to women’s reproductive health in particular. This obligate intracellular pathogen resides and replicates within a cellular compartment termed an inclusion, where it is sheltered by unknown mechanisms from gamma-interferon (IFNγ)-induced cell-autonomous host immunity. Through a genetic screen, we uncovered the Chlamydia inclusion membrane protein gamma resistance determinant (GarD) as a bacterial factor protecting inclusions from cell-autonomous immunity. In IFNγ-primed human cells, inclusions formed by garD loss-of-function mutants become decorated with linear ubiquitin and are eliminated. Leveraging cellular genome-wide association data, we identified the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 as a candidate anti-Chlamydia protein. We demonstrate that IFNγ-inducible RNF213 facilitates the ubiquitylation and destruction of GarD-deficient inclusions. Furthermore, we show that GarD operates as a cis-acting stealth factor barring RNF213 from targeting inclusions, thus functionally defining GarD as an RNF213 antagonist essential for chlamydial growth during IFNγ-stimulated immunity.

Abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths. We have previously connected a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronic acid (HA), with a common hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor, 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiol-3-thione (ADT-OH), to reconstruct a novel conjugate, HA-ADT. In this study, we determined the effect of HA-ADT on the growth of ESCC. Our data suggested that HA-ADT exerted more potent effects than sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a fast H2S-releasing donor) and morpholin-4-ium (4-methoxyphenyl)-morpholin-4-ylsulfanylidenesulfido-λ5-phosphane (GYY4137, a slow H2S-releasing donor) on inhibiting the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of human ESCC cells. HA-ADT increased apoptosis by suppressing the protein expressions of phospho (p)-Ser473-protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), p-Tyr199/Tyr458-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and p-Ser2448-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), but suppressed autophagy through the inhibition of the protein levels of p-Ser552-β‐catenin, p‐Ser9-glycogen synthase kinase‐3β (GSK-3β), and Wnt3a in human ESCC cells. In addition, HA-ADT was more effective in terms of the growth inhibition of human ESCC xenograft tumor than NaHS and GYY4137. In conclusion, HA-ADT can suppress ESCC progression via apoptosis promotion and autophagy inhibition. HA-ADT might be efficacious for the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed an efficient approach to generate functional induced dopaminergic (DA) neurons from adult human dermal fibroblasts. When performing DA neuronal conversion of patient fibroblasts with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD), we could specifically detect disease-relevant pathology in these cells. We show that the patient-derived neurons maintain age-related properties of the donor and exhibit lower basal chaperone-mediated autophagy compared with healthy donors. Furthermore, stress-induced autophagy resulted in an age-dependent accumulation of macroautophagic structures. Finally, we show that these impairments in patient-derived DA neurons leads to an accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein, the classical hallmark of PD pathology. This pathological phenotype is absent in neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells from the same patients. Taken together, our results show that direct neural reprogramming can be used for obtaining patient-derived DA neurons, which uniquely function as a cellular model to study age-related pathology relevant to idiopathic PD.

Abstract: MRG domain binding protein (MRGBP) has been proposed to participate in the development of multiple tumors. However, the role of MRGBP in colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains largely unknown. Here, we found that MRGBP expression is significantly elevated in CRC, and that higher MRGBP expression correlates with poorer survival in CRC patients. Experiments in vivo and in vitro indicated that MRGBP promotes CRC cells proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and xenograft tumor growth. Mechanically, for one thing, we discovered that MRGBP suppresses DKK1 expression, thus further activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC cells. For another, MRGBP also enhances acetylation of NF-kB/p65 pathway. Treatment with Wnt/β-catenin and NF-kB pathways inhibitors further confirmed the mediation of these two pathways in MRGBP-promoted CRC cell processes. In conclusion, these findings together suggest that MRGBP promotes CRC progression via DKK1/Wnt/β-catenin and NF-kB/p65 pathways mediated EMT, identifying MRGBP as a promising prognostic and therapeutic target for CRC.

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for about 15% of diagnosed breast cancer patients, which has a poor survival outcome owing to a lack of effective therapies. This study aimed to explore the in vitro and in vivo efficiency of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat (PANO) in combination with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA) against TNBC. TNBC cells were treated with PANO, RAPA alone or the combination of drugs, then cell growth and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8, colony formation and flow cytometry. Cell migration and invasion were detected by wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. ROS production was detected by DCFH-DA staining. Western blotting was performed to detect protein levels. In vivo tumor growth was assessed in nude mice. The expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Ki-67 in tumor tissues was detected by immunofluorescence staining. H&E staining was conducted to observe the pathological changes in heart, liver, and kidney tissues. The combination of PANO and RAPA exerted a stronger role in repressing growth, migration, invasion, and inducing apoptosis of TNBC cells compared with monotherapy. Furthermore, this combination presented a more effective anti-cancer efficacy than a single treatment in the xenograft model without apparent toxic side effects. Importantly, mechanistic studies indicated that PANO and RAPA combination led to ROS overproduction, which subsequently activated endoplasmic reticulum stress. Conclusion: PANO in combination with RAPA exhibits enhanced efficacy against TNBC, which may be considered a promising therapeutic candidate.

Abstract: The molecular chaperone TNF-receptor-associated protein-1 (TRAP1) controls mitochondrial respiration through regulation of Krebs cycle and electron transport chain activity. Post-translational modification (PTM) of TRAP1 regulates its activity, thereby controlling global metabolic flux. O-GlcNAcylation is one PTM that is known to impact mitochondrial metabolism, however the major effectors of this regulatory PTM remain inadequately resolved. Here we demonstrate that TRAP1-O-GlcNAcylation decreases TRAP1 ATPase activity, leading to increased mitochondrial metabolism. O-GlcNAcylation of TRAP1 occurs following mitochondrial import and provides critical regulatory feedback, as the impact of O-GlcNAcylation on mitochondrial metabolism shows TRAP1-dependence. Mechanistically, loss of TRAP1-O-GlcNAcylation decreased TRAP1 binding to ATP, and interaction with its client protein succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB). Taken together, TRAP1-O-GlcNAcylation serves to regulate mitochondrial metabolism by the reversible attenuation of TRAP1 chaperone activity.

Abstract: Summary
In microgravity, cells undergo profound changes in their properties. However, how human cardiac progenitors respond to space microgravity is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of space microgravity on differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiac progenitors compared with 1G cultures on the International Space Station (ISS). Cryopreserved 3D cardiac progenitors were cultured for 3 weeks on the ISS. Compared with 1G cultures, the microgravity cultures had 3-fold larger sphere sizes, 20-fold higher counts of nuclei, and increased expression of proliferation markers. Highly enriched cardiomyocytes generated in space microgravity showed improved Ca2+ handling and increased expression of contraction-associated genes. Short-term exposure (3 days) of cardiac progenitors to space microgravity upregulated genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, cardiac differentiation, and contraction, consistent with improved microgravity cultures at the late stage. These results indicate that space microgravity increased proliferation of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes, which had appropriate structure and function.

Abstract: Summary
Protein nanoparticle scaffolds are increasingly used in next-generation vaccine designs, and several have established records of clinical safety and efficacy. Yet the rules for how immune responses specific to nanoparticle scaffolds affect the immunogenicity of displayed antigens have not been established. Here we define relationships between anti-scaffold and antigen-specific antibody responses elicited by protein nanoparticle immunogens. We report that dampening anti-scaffold responses by physical masking does not enhance antigen-specific antibody responses. In a series of immunogens that all use the same nanoparticle scaffold but display four different antigens, only HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is subdominant to the scaffold. However, we also demonstrate that scaffold-specific antibody responses can competitively inhibit antigen-specific responses when the scaffold is provided in excess. Overall, our results suggest that anti-scaffold antibody responses are unlikely to suppress antigen-specific antibody responses for protein nanoparticle immunogens in which the antigen is immunodominant over the scaffold.

Abstract: Lysine demethylase 1B (Kdm1b) is known as an epigenetic modifier with demethylase activity against H3K4 and H3K9 histones and plays an important role in tumor progression and tumor stem cell enrichment. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the role of Kdm1b in somatic cell reprogramming. We found that exogenous expression of Kdm1b in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) can influence the epigenetic modifications of histones. Subsequent analysis further suggests that the overexpression of Kdm1b can promote cell proliferation, reprogram metabolism and inhibit cell apoptosis. In addition, a series of multipotent factors including Sox2 and Nanog, and several epigenetic factors that may reduce epigenetic barriers were upregulated to varying degrees. More importantly, HDFs transfected with the combination of Oct4 (POU5F1), Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc and Kdm1b (OSKMK) achieved higher reprogramming efficiency. Therefore, we suggest that Kdm1b is an important epigenetic factor associated with pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
The pattern-recognition receptor NOD2 senses bacterial muropeptides to regulate host immunity and maintain homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations in NOD2 are associated with Crohn’s disease (CD), but how the variations in microbial factors influence NOD2 signaling and host pathology is elusive. We demonstrate that the Firmicutes peptidoglycan remodeling enzyme, DL-endopeptidase, increased the NOD2 ligand level in the gut and impacted colitis outcomes. Metagenomic analyses of global cohorts (n = 857) revealed that DL-endopeptidase gene abundance decreased globally in CD patients and negatively correlated with colitis. Fecal microbiota from CD patients with low DL-endopeptidase activity predisposed mice to colitis. Administering DL-endopeptidase, but not an active site mutant, alleviated colitis via the NOD2 pathway. Therapeutically restoring NOD2 ligands with a DL-endopeptidase-producing Lactobacillus salivarius strain or mifamurtide, a clinical analog of muramyl dipeptide, exerted potent anti-colitis effects.

Abstract: Summary
Although previous studies suggest that amino acids (AAs) and microbiota-related metabolites (MRMs) are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the results remain unclear among normoglycemic populations. We test 28 serum AAs and 22 MRMs in 3,414 subjects with incident diabetes and matched normoglycemic controls from the China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort (4C) Study. In fully adjusted logistic regression models, per SD increment of branched-chain AAs, aromatic AAs, asparagine, alanine, glutamic acid, homoserine, 2-aminoadipic acid, histidine, methionine, and proline are positively associated with incident T2DM. In the MRM panel, serum carnitines, N-acetyltryptophan, and uric acid are positively associated with incident T2DM. Causal mediation analyses indicate 34 significant causal mediation linkages, with 88.2% through obesity and lipids. Variances explained in the serum metabolites are modestly limited in the comprehensive catalog of risk factor–metabolite–diabetes associations. These findings reveal that systematic AAs and MRMs change profile before T2DM onset and support a potential role of metabolic alterations in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Planarians have long been studied for their regenerative abilities. Moving forward, tools for ectopic expression of non-native proteins will be of substantial value. Using a luminescent reporter to overcome the strong autofluorescence of planarian tissues, we demonstrate heterologous protein expression in planarian cells and live animals. Our approach is based on the introduction of mRNA through several nanotechnological and chemical transfection methods. We improve reporter expression by altering untranslated region (UTR) sequences and codon bias, facilitating the measurement of expression kinetics in both isolated cells and whole planarians using luminescence imaging. We also examine protein expression as a function of variations in the UTRs of delivered mRNA, demonstrating a framework to investigate gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. Together, these advances expand the toolbox for the mechanistic analysis of planarian biology and establish a foundation for the development and expansion of transgenic techniques in this unique model system.

Abstract: Summary
In the past decade it has become evident that neuroblasts continue to supply the human cortex with interneurons via unique migratory streams shortly following birth. Owing to the size of the human brain, these newborn neurons must migrate long distances through complex cellular landscapes to reach their final locations. This process is poorly understood, largely because of technical difficulties in acquiring and studying neurotypical postmortem human samples along with diverging developmental features of well-studied mouse models. We reasoned that migratory streams of neuroblasts utilize cellular substrates, such as blood vessels, to guide their trek from the subventricular zone to distant cortical targets. Here, we evaluate the association between young interneuronal migratory streams and their preferred cellular substrates in gyrencephalic piglets during the developmental equivalent of human birth, infancy, and toddlerhood.

Abstract: Osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) is limited in hypoxia, and HIF-1α is key to the response to hypoxia. However, its mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study discovered an osteogenesis-related gene sensitive to hypoxia in PDLSCs, and investigated the molecular mechanisms between HIF-1α and the gene. NOG, a gene that negatively regulates osteogenesis, was discovered by RNA-seq. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α overexpression led to enhanced expression of NOG/Noggin and inhibited the expression of osteogenesis-related genes, while inhibition of HIF-1α reversed this effect. The expression of HIF-1α, NOG/Noggin and the osteogenesis-related genes were detected by qRT-PCR or Western blot. Mechanistically, we verified that HIF-1α binds to the hypoxia response element (−1505 to −1502) in the promotor of NOG to enhance secretion of Noggin by chromatin immunoprecipitation and a dual-luciferase reporter assay. IHC staining findings in an animal model verified that Noggin-associated osteogenic differentiation was inhibited in hypoxia. NOG displayed a concordant relationship with HIF-1α, and secreted more with increasing of HIF-1α. Hypoxia stabilized HIF-1α, which bound to the HRE (−1505 to −1502) of the NOG promotor to enhance NOG transcription resulted in inhibiting osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. This study offers a promising therapy for periodontitis.

Abstract: Summary
Omicron has become the globally dominant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, creating additional challenges due to its ability to evade neutralization. Here, we report that neutralizing antibodies against Omicron variants are undetected following COVID-19 infection with ancestral or past SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses or after two-dose mRNA vaccination. Compared with two-dose vaccination, a three-dose vaccination course induces broad neutralizing antibody responses with improved durability against different SARS-CoV-2 variants, although neutralizing antibody titers against Omicron remain low. Intriguingly, among individuals with three-dose vaccination, Omicron breakthrough infection substantially augments serum neutralizing activity against a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron variants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5. Additionally, after Omicron breakthrough infection, memory T cells respond to the spike proteins of both ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 by producing cytokines with polyfunctionality. These results suggest that Omicron breakthrough infection following three-dose mRNA vaccination induces pan-SARS-CoV-2 immunity that may protect against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Abstract: Oxidative stress damage to the lens is a key factor in most cataracts. Forkhead box O 4 (FOXO4), a member of the forkhead box O family, plays a pivotal role in oxidative stress. FOXO4 is upregulated in lens of age-related cataract patients, but its role in cataract has not been elucidated. Herein, we investigated the role and mechanism of FOXO4 during oxidative stress damage in lens epithelial cells. H2O2 treatment enhanced FOXO4 expression in HLEpiC cells. Short hairpin RNAs mediated FOXO4 silence aggravated H2O2-induced cell apoptosis. In addition, upon H2O2 exposure, silencing of FOXO4 reduced SOD and CAT activities, as well as increased intracellular MDA and ROS levels. FOXO4 silencing also inhibited Nrf2 nuclear translocation, followed by reducing the expressions of Nrf2-governed antioxidant genes HO-1 and NOQ-1. Exogenous overexpression of FOXO4 was also involved in this study and exhibited opposite effects of FOXO4-silencing. Mechanistically, FOXO4 directly bound the promoter of TRIM25 and regulated its transcription, thereby activating the Nrf2 signaling. Taken together, in the condition of oxidative stress, the expression of FOXO4 showed a compensatory upregulation and it exhibited an anti-oxidative effect by modulating the transcription of TRIM25, thus activating the Nrf2 signaling. The FOXO4/TRIM25/Nrf2 axis may be associated with the pathological mechanisms of cataract.

Abstract: Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), leading to chronic inflammation, while bacterial components lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) are often present in airways of COPD patients, especially during exacerbations. We hypothesised that extracellular heat shock protein 70 (eHsp70), a damage-associated molecular pattern elevated in serum of COPD patients, induces inflammation and alters cigarette smoke and LPS/LTA-induced inflammatory effects in the airway epithelium. We used 16HBE cells exposed to recombinant human (rh)Hsp70 and its combinations with cigarette smoke extract (CSE), LPS or LTA to investigate those assumptions, and we determined pro-inflammatory cytokines’ secretion as well as TLR2 and TLR4 gene expression. rhHsp70 and CSE alone stimulated IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α secretion. CSE and rhHsp70 had antagonistic effect on IL-6 secretion, while combinations of LPS or LTA with rhHsp70 showed antagonistic effect on TNF-α release. By using specific inhibitors, we demonstrated that effects of rhHsp70 on cytokines’ secretion were mediated via NF-κB and/or MAPK signalling pathways. rhHsp70 increased, and CSE decreased TLR2 gene expression compared to untreated cells, but their combinations increased it compared to CSE alone. LPS and rhHsp70 combinations decreased TLR2 gene expression compared to untreated cells. TLR4 expression was not induced by any of the treatments. In conclusion, we demonstrated that extracellular Hsp70 modulates pro-inflammatory responses of human airway epithelial cells to cigarette smoke and bacterial components LPS and LTA. Simultaneous presence of those compounds and their interactions might lead to inappropriate immune responses and adverse consequences in COPD.

Abstract: Elevated hepatic gluconeogenesis is a major contributor of fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are tightly linked to glucose metabolism, but their role in hepatic gluconeogenesis remains largely unkown. In this current study, miR-34a-5p expression was significantly increased in liver tissues of db/db mice. Overexpression of miR-34a-5p promoted hepatic glucose production in mouse primary hepatocytes with increased expressions of gluconeogenic genes while miR-34a-5p inhibition displayed a contrary action. MiR-34a-5p overexpression in mouse primary hepatocytes repressed SIRT1 expression. SIRT1 inhibition by EX527 blocked phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) protein degradation and enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis. Treatment of A485 (a CBP/p300 inhibitor) decreased miR-34a-5p and PEPCK expressions in the livers of db/db mice, but elevated SIRT1 protein expression. In mouse primary hepatocytes, A485 exhibited a similar result. Overexpression of miR-34a-5p attenuated A485-inhibited gluconeogenic gene expressions and A485-induced SIRT1 protein expression. Finally, after miR-34a-5p was inhibited in the livers of db/db mice, hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expressions were markedly lowered. Our findings highlight a critical role of miR-34a-5p in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and miR-34a-5p may be a potential target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Renal fibrosis is a global health concern with limited curative treatment. Canonical transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6), a nonselective cation channel, has been shown to regulate the renal fibrosis in murine models. However, the molecular mechanism is unclear. Fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation is one of the critical steps in the progression of renal fibrosis. In the present study, we demonstrate that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 exposure significantly increases the TRPC6 expression in renal interstitial fibroblast NRK-49F cells. Pharmacological inhibition of TRPC6 and knockdown of Trpc6 by siRNA alleviate TGF-β1-increased expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen I, two key markers of myofibroblasts. Although direct activation of TRPC6 by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) does not affect the expression of α-SMA and collagen I, OAG potentiates TGF-β1-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Further study demonstrates that TGF-β1 exposure increases the phosphorylation level of p38 and Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation into the nuclei. Inhibition of p38 and YAP decreases TGF-β1-enhanced TRPC6 and α-SMA expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TRPC6 is a key regulator of TGF-β1-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation and provides the mechanism of how TGF-β1 exposure regulates TRPC6 expression in NRK-49F fibroblasts.

Abstract: Adult fibrosarcoma is an aggressive subtype of soft tissue sarcoma (STS), in which high expression of KIF20A indicates a poor prognosis. However, the precise role of KIF20A in fibrosarcoma progression remains unknown. In this study, we initially examined KIF20A expression and function in the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080. The results showed that KIF20A was highly expressed in HT-1080, knockdown of KIF20A impaired cell proliferation, migration, invasion and induced G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis. Transcriptome study suggested that PI3K-Akt signal pathway was involved in these biological changes. We confirmed that PI3K-Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways were impaired after the down-regulation of KIF20A, which can be reversed by the Akt activator SC79 in HT-1080 in vitro. In a xenograft mouse model, knockdown of KIF20A inhibited tumor growth, Ki67 expression and liver metastasis. Taken together, our results suggested that KIF20A promoted fibrosarcoma progression via PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and might be a potential therapeutic target for fibrosarcoma.

Abstract: Summary
Milk fortifiers help meet the nutritional needs of preterm infants receiving their mother’s own milk (MOM) or donor human milk. We conducted a randomized clinical trial (NCT03214822) in 30 very low birth weight premature neonates comparing bovine-derived human milk fortifier (BHMF) versus human-derived fortifier (H2MF). We found that fortifier type does not affect the overall microbiome, although H2MF infants were less often colonized by an unclassified member of Clostridiales Family XI. Secondary analyses show that MOM intake is strongly associated with weight gain and microbiota composition, including Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, and Propionibacterium enrichment. Finally, we show that while oxidative stress (urinary F2-isoprostanes) is not affected by fortifier type or MOM intake, fecal calprotectin is higher in H2MF infants and lower in those consuming more MOM. Overall, the source of human milk (mother versus donor) appears more important than the type of milk fortifier (human versus bovine) in shaping preterm infant gut microbiota.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors and have gradually become a hot topic in the field of glioma research in recent years. In this study, the role of lung cancer associated transcript 1 (lncRNA LUCAT 1) in glioma occurrence and development, as well as its possible regulatory mechanism, was explored. We utilized the gene chip technology in the preliminary experiment, and based on the experiment results, selected LUCAT1（NONHSAT102745）, which was significantly upregulated in glioma, and ATP-binding cassette Subfamily B member l (ABCB1), which was significantly down-regulated in co-expression analysis, for study. Next, the expression of LUCAT1 and ABCB1 in cells and tissues was immediately evaluated. Subsequently, the cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA, LUCAT1-siRNA/ABCB 1-siRNA, or overexpressed LUCAT1/ABCB1 plasmid + RAS signaling pathway inhibitor-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS). By comparing with the normal combination negative control group, the cell proliferation and invasion ability were evaluated. Finally, subcutaneous tumor formation experiments in the nude mice confirmed the association between LUCAT1 and ABCB1 and RAS signaling pathways. The expression of LUCAT 1 was up-regulated with an increase in WHO grade, and the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression analysis showed that the expression of ABCB1 was low. LUCAT 1 gene knockout reduced the mRNA and protein levels of Ras signaling pathway related factors (Ras, Raf-1, p-AKT, and p-ERK) as regulating ABCB1 expression and inhibiting the ability of tumor in proliferation and invasion no matter in vitro or in vivo. For overexpressing of LUCAT 1, the opposite was true. After we knocked out ABCB1, the LUCAT1 expression was reversely regulated while the level of RAS signaling pathway related factors increased, and the ability of tumors in proliferation and invasion was enhanced. The abnormal LUCAT1 expression affected the biological behaviors of glioma cells, such as proliferation, invasion, etc. by regulating ABCB1 and promoting the activation of the RAS signaling pathway. This provided a new drug target and therapeutic approach for gene therapy of glioma, which is expected to significantly improve the prognosis of relevant patients.

Abstract: Although sensitization of BRCA-mutated, homologous recombination (HR)-deficient breast cancer cells through PARP inhibitor is widely studied, not much is known about the treatment of BRCA-wild-type, HR-proficient breast cancer. Here, we aim to investigate whether a bioactive compound, Resveratrol (RES), can induce DNA double-strand breaks in HR-proficient breast cancer cells and Olaparib (OLA), a PARP inhibitor, can enhance the RES-mediated apoptosis by deregulating the HR repair pathway. The detailed mechanism of anti-cancer action of RES + OLA combination in breast cancer has been evaluated using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo preclinical model systems. OLA increased RES-mediated DNA damage, downregulated the HR pathway proteins, caused a late S/G2 cell cycle arrest, enhanced apoptosis and cell death in RES pre-treated breast cancer cells at much lower concentrations than their individual treatments. Direct measurement of HR pathway activity using a GFP plasmid-based assay demonstrated reduced HR efficiency in I-SceI endonuclease-transfected cells treated with OLA. Moreover, RES + OLA treatment also caused significant reduction in PARP1-mediated PARylation and efficiently trapped PARP1 at the DNA damage site. Upon RES treatment, PARylated PARP1 was found to interact with BRCA1, which then activated other HR pathway proteins. But after addition of OLA in RES pre-treated cells, PARP1 could not interact with BRCA1 due to inhibition of PARylation. This resulted in deregulation of HR pathway. To further confirm the role of BRCA1 in PARP1-mediated HR pathway activation, BRCA1 was knocked down that caused complete inhibition of HR pathway activity, and further enhanced apoptosis after RES + OLA treatment in BRCA1-silenced cells. In agreement with in vitro data, similar experimental results were obtained in ex vivo patient-derived breast cancer cells and in vivo xenograft mice. Thus, RES + OLA combination treatment enhanced breast cancer cell death by causing excessive DNA damage and also simultaneously inhibiting the HR pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) transplantation could enhance bone repair. However, the cell fate of transplanted MSCs, in terms of their local distribution and spatial associations with other types of cells were poorly understood. Here, we developed a single-cell 3D spatial correlation (sc3DSC) method to track transplanted MSCs based on deep tissue microscopy of fluorescent nanoparticles (fNPs) and immunofluorescence of key proteins. Locally delivered fNP-labeled MSCs enhanced tibial defect repair, increased the number of stem cells and vascular maturity in mice. fNP-MSCs persisted in the defect throughout repair. But only a small portion of transplanted cells underwent osteogenic differentiation (OSX+); a significant portion has maintained their expression of mesenchymal stem cell and skeletal stem cell markers (SCA-1 and PRRX1). Our results contribute to the optimization of MSC-based therapies. The sc3DSC method may be useful in studying cell-based therapies for the regeneration of other tissue types or disease models.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq) identifies genomic regions with DNA methylation, using a protocol adapted to work with low-input DNA samples and with cell-free DNA (cfDNA). We developed a set of synthetic spike-in DNA controls for cfMeDIP-seq to provide a simple and inexpensive reference for quantitative normalization. We designed 54 DNA fragments with combinations of methylation status (methylated and unmethylated), fragment length (80 bp, 160 bp, 320 bp), G + C content (35%, 50%, 65%), and fraction of CpG dinucleotides within the fragment (1/80 bp, 1/40 bp, 1/20 bp). Using 0.01 ng of spike-in controls enables training a generalized linear model that absolutely quantifies methylated cfDNA in MeDIP-seq experiments. It mitigates batch effects and corrects for biases in enrichment due to known biophysical properties of DNA fragments and other technical biases.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro tissue models hold great promise for modeling diseases and drug responses. Here, we used emulsion microfluidics to form micro-organospheres (MOSs), which are droplet-encapsulated miniature three-dimensional (3D) tissue models that can be established rapidly from patient tissues or cells. MOSs retain key biological features and responses to chemo-, targeted, and radiation therapies compared with organoids. The small size and large surface-to-volume ratio of MOSs enable various applications including quantitative assessment of nutrient dependence, pathogen-host interaction for anti-viral drug screening, and a rapid potency assay for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy. An automated MOS imaging pipeline combined with machine learning overcomes plating variation, distinguishes tumorspheres from stroma, differentiates cytostatic versus cytotoxic drug effects, and captures resistant clones and heterogeneity in drug response. This pipeline is capable of robust assessments of drug response at individual-tumorsphere resolution and provides a rapid and high-throughput therapeutic profiling platform for precision medicine.

Abstract: The incidence and mortality of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are increasing in Taiwan and worldwide. The prognosis of this disease has improved little in the last few decades due to insufficient knowledge of the etiology. Previous studies on the role of ovulation in the development of EOC have unveiled IGF2, HGF, and other carcinogens in ovulatory follicular fluid (FF) that exert transformation activities on the exposed fallopian tube fimbria epithelium. However, an orthotopic proof in an animal model is lacking. By using the murine ID8 EOC cells and the syngenic transplantation model, this study explored the effect of FF on the oncogenesis of mouse ovarian cancer. We found FF promoted clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth of ID8 cells, largely through the IGF-1R and cMET signaling. In contrast, FF modestly promoted cell proliferation independent of the two signals and did not affect cell migration and invasion. Transplantation of ID8 cells into the ovarian bursa of C57BL6/J mice orthotopically grew ovarian tumors and metastasized to the peritoneum with ascites formation. The tumorigenic rate and severity of the disease were positively correlated with the level of IGF-1R and cMET receptors on the cell surface. Our data demonstrated that ovulation, through the signaling of IGF/IGF-1R and HGF/cMET, promotes oncogenic phenotypes in a murine EOC model. The results provide further proof of the carcinogenic effect of ovulation in the development of EOC.

Abstract: Summary
Unlike mRNA vaccines based only on the spike protein, inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines should induce a diversified T cell response recognizing distinct structural proteins. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in healthy individuals following vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or mRNA vaccines. Relative to spike mRNA vaccination, inactivated vaccines elicit a lower magnitude of spike-specific T cells, but the combination of membrane, nucleoprotein, and spike-specific T cell response is quantitatively comparable with the sole spike T cell response induced by mRNA vaccine, and they efficiently tolerate the mutations characterizing the Omicron lineage. However, this multi-protein-specific T cell response is not mediated by a coordinated CD4 and CD8 T cell expansion but by selective priming of CD4 T cells. These findings can help in understanding the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the efficacy of the different vaccines to control severe COVID-19 after Omicron infection.

Abstract: Multitargeted kinase inhibitors (MKIs) including sorafenib and lenvatinib, are applied for first-line treatment for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, but the therapeutic effect is limited because of drug resistance. Therefore, we sought potential biomarkers to indicate sorafenib and lenvatinib resistance in HCC. In this article, we report a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), AC026401.3, in promoting sorafenib and lenvatinib resistance of HCC cells. AC026401.3 is upregulated in HCC tissues and is positively relevant to HCC patients with large tumor size, cancer recurrence, advanced TNM stage, and poor prognosis. AC026401.3 knockdown or knockout enhances the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib, respectively. Moreover, AC026401.3 upregulates the expression of the transcription factor E2F2. Mechanistically, AC026401.3 interacts with OCT1 and promotes the recruitment of OCT1 to the promoter region of E2F2, intensifying sorafenib and lenvatinib resistance in HCC by activating the transcription of E2F2. In conclusion, our results reveal that lncRNA AC026401.3 is a risk factor for HCC patients by enhancing sorafenib and lenvatinib resistance of HCC cells, and targeting the AC026401.3-OCT1-E2F2 signaling axis would be a promising strategy for HCC therapeutics.
