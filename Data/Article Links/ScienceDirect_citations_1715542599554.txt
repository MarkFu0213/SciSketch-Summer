Abstract: Summary
Rechargeable Li-CO2 batteries, an emerging battery technology to confront the environmental and energy crises, hold promise for CO2 fixation and energy storage. However, state-of-the-art Li-CO2 systems generally suffer from sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction kinetics, and powerful catalysts that can simultaneously facilitate both processes are much desired but largely unrealized. Here, we report a series of Ru, metal-chelated conjugated N4-macrocyclic metal complex (M-CPY) and carbon nanotube (CNT)-based hybrid materials (Ru/M-CPY@CNT) with the advantages of highly dispersed Ru and M-CPY, high-conductivity, and tunable loadings that can be applied as multi-functional cathode catalysts. Ru/Co-CPY@CNT-2-based cells deliver an ultra-low overpotential (0.84 V) and enable fully reversible discharge/charge with a high specific capacity of 24,740 mAh/g within 2.0–4.5 V at 200 mA/g. It can rapidly discharge/charge for 180 cycles at 500 mA/g, and the CO2 activation process is intensively investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Abstract: Summary
Fiber supercapacitors have attracted significant attention because of the relevance for textile electronics. However, the key challenge is to achieve high output voltage and performance of fiber supercapacitors while maintaining the high flexibility of the fibers. Here, we present a fiber supercapacitor, based on an overlaid tree topology configuration, by braiding sub-fiber supercapacitor units in an asymmetrical series connection. The tree-like topology-based asymmetric fiber supercapacitors (TTAFSCs) achieve a high energy density (0.022 Wh cm−3 at a power density of 0.444 W cm−3) with an extendable high voltage output (>9.6 V) while maintaining outstanding mechanical properties (>1,000 bending cycles, capable of loading an object of ∼200 g). TTAFSCs of ∼8 cm in length are capable of lighting light-emitting diodes, driving a watch, and powering a display, even in a bent and twisted state.

Abstract: Summary
New carbon forms that exhibit extraordinary physicochemical properties can be generated from nanostructured precursors under extreme pressure. Nevertheless, synthesis of such fascinating materials is often not well understood. That is the case of the C60 precursor, with irreproducible results that impede further progress in the materials design. Here, the semiconducting amorphous carbon, having band gaps of 0.1–0.3 eV and the advantages of isotropic superhardness and superior toughness over single-crystal diamond and inorganic glasses, is produced from fullerene at high pressure and moderate temperatures. A systematic investigation of the structure and bonding evolution is carried out with complementary characterization methods, which helps to build a model of the transformation that can be used in further high-pressure/high-temperature (high p,T) synthesis of novel nano-carbon systems for advanced applications. The amorphous carbon materials produced have the potential of accomplishing the demanding optoelectronic applications that diamond and graphene cannot achieve.

Abstract: Background
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by frequent, unpredictable pain episodes and other vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) leading to significant healthcare utilization. VOC frequency is often an endpoint in clinical trials investigating novel therapies for this devastating disease.
Procedure
The Consortium for the Advancement of Sickle Cell Research (CASiRe) is an international collaboration investigating clinical severity in SCD using a validated questionnaire and medical chart review standardized across four countries (United States, United Kingdom, Italy and Ghana).
Results
This study, focused on pain crisis incidence and healthcare utilization, included 868 patients, equally represented according to age and gender. HgbSS was the most common genotype. Patients from Ghana used the Emergency Room/Day Hospital for pain more frequently (annualized mean 2.01) than patients from other regions (annualized mean 1.56 U.S.; 1.09 U.K.; 0.02 Italy), while U.K. patients were hospitalized for pain more often (annualized mean: U.K. 2.98) than patients in other regions (annualized mean 1.98 U.S.; 1.18 Ghana; Italy 0.54). Italy's hospitalization rate for pain (annualized mean: 0.57) was nearly 20 times greater than its emergency room/day hospital only visits for pain (annualized mean: 0.03). When categorized by genotype and age, similar results were seen.
Conclusions
Geographic differences in pain crisis frequency and healthcare utilization may correlate with variable organization of healthcare systems among countries and should be considered regarding trial design, endpoints, and analysis of results when investigating novel agents for clinical benefit.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large, single-copy, membrane-bound organelle that comprises an elaborate 3D network of diverse structural subdomains, including highly curved tubules, flat sheets, and parts that form contacts with nearly every other organelle. The dynamic and complex organization of the ER poses a major challenge on understanding how its functioning – maintenance of the structure, distribution of its functions and communication with other organelles – is orchestrated. In this study, we resolved a unique localization profile within the ER network for several resident ER proteins representing a broad range of functions associated with the ER using immuno-electron microscopy and calculation of a relative labeling index (RLI). Our results demonstrated the effect of changing cellular environment on protein localization and highlighted the importance of correct protein expression level when analyzing its localization at subdomain resolution. We present new software tools for anonymization of images for blind analysis and for quantitative assessment of membrane contact sites (MCSs) from thin section transmission electron microscopy micrographs. The analysis of ER-mitochondria contacts suggested the presence of at least three different types of MCSs that responded differently to changes in cellular lipid loading status.

Abstract: Summary
Existing CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of ethane has yet to demonstrate >60% single-pass CO yield due to the intrinsic equilibrium limitations. We report a unique approach with mixed molten carbonates as a reaction medium for CO2-ODH, which strategically partitions the CO2-ODH reactions into gas and molten-salt phases and facilitates integrated CO2 capture from power plant flue gases. An 89% CO yield was achieved at 770°C, doubling the equilibrium limitation of conventional CO2-ODH. The high CO yield in turn enhances ethylene formation. Further characterizations confirmed that molten-salt mediated ODH (MM-ODH) proceeds through a gas-phase cracking and molten-salt mediated reverse water-gas-shift reaction pathway. Based on this understanding, thermodynamic analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to develop general principles to optimize the molten-salt reaction medium. Process analyses confirm that MM-ODH has the potential to be significantly more efficient for CO2 capture and utilization than conventional CO2-ODH.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochemical plating of Li metal on the graphite electrode is the key limitation behind slow charging times of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles (EVs). Currently, electrochemical methods to detect the onset of Li plating while a battery is fast charging are sparse. In this study, we use operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to reliably detect the onset of Li plating on graphite electrodes in three-electrode LIBs. An increase in the graphite solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) resistance indicates that Li plating has occurred. By cross-validating with a highly sensitive ex situ chemical titration, we determine that this technique can detect very small amounts of plated Li (<0.6% of the graphite electrode’s capacity). We also offer physical explanations for the observed impedance behavior. Finally, we show that this technique can be applied to standard two-electrode LIB systems, making the method an important step toward safely implementing fast charging protocols for LIBs in EVs.

Abstract: Summary
Agrochemical fungicidal leads have been prepared from photochemically derived 1-aminonorbornane building blocks. The unique 1-aminonorbornane core is generated via direct excitation of a Schiff base precursor, leveraging the N-centered radical character of the excited state species to facilitate a series of radical reactions that construct the norbornane core. This process requires no exogenous reagents, only solvent and photons; thus, it represents an exceptionally simple and efficient means of generating the key building blocks. These (hetero)arene-fused 1-aminonorbornanes are unprecedented in both the agrochemical and pharmaceutical discovery literature; therefore, photochemical advances have provided the unique opportunity to explore the functional utility of novel chemical space. Toward this end, the 1-aminonorbornanes were used to generate next-generation succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors. In vitro fungicidal activity is demonstrated against three fungal plant pathogens affecting field crops, specifically: Fusarium graminearum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Macrophomina phaseolina. The in vitro performance against F. graminearum was shown to translate into a greenhouse setting. The discovery of in planta fungicidal activity illustrates the interdisciplinary value available via photochemical innovation.

Abstract: Summary
Organometal compounds are an emerging environmental micropollutant. Their removal presents a challenge, while their typically low concentrations require capture materials with high affinities. Here, inspired by the natural phenomenon that the abundant hydrogen bonds of protein enhance their inorganic metal capture, we design a bio-inspired trap integrating a Zr coordination center on polyhydric nanocellulose (ZNC). ZNC shows an affinity (1.99 × 106 mg L−1) toward low-level organoarsenic, which is 10 times higher than reported materials, and thus exhibits excellent extraction efficiency (>99.9%). Similar enhancement is observed for other organometals (organotin and organophosphorus). This is attributed to the high-density H-bond network of ZNC, which enhances capture via modulating zirconium atom distance, changing coordination environment, and shortening coordination distance. This work explores potential applications of bio-inspired H-bonds for advanced removal of organometal micropollutants from wastewater.

Abstract: Summary
Radiation-processed strategy is compatible with scalable manufacturing of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we show such radiation-processed planar negative-intrinsic-positive (n-i-p) PSCs, which integrate radiation-processed electron/hole transporting layers (ETLs/HTLs) and light-absorbing layers (LALs). Infrared radiation annealing enables SnO2 ETLs with a conductivity comparable to those annealed by hot plates and renders perovskite LALs with pure perovskite phase and prominent (111) orientation. With the benefit of chlorofullerene C60Cl6 additives for LALs, PSCs based on Li/Co-bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (TFSI)-doped spiro-OMeTAD HTLs exhibit a champion efficiency of 22% and excellent photostability, retaining 82% of their efficiencies after 504 h of illumination. With the solar-radiation-treated gadolinium-endohedral fullerene Gd@C82-doped spiro-OMeTAD, the radiation-processed PSCs show stable efficiencies of more than 20% and decent shelf stability, maintaining 92% of their efficiencies after 1,008 h in air. Based on that prototype of radiation-processed PSCs, this work implies that cost-efficient fullerene additives/dopants are beneficial to the feasible radiation strategy for fabricating efficient and stable PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
State-of-the-art p-i-n-based 3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) use nickel oxide (NiOX) as an efficient hole transport layer (HTL), achieving efficiencies >22%. However, translating this to phase-pure 2D perovskites has been unsuccessful. Here, we report 2D phase-pure Ruddlesden-Popper BA2MA3Pb4I13 perovskites with 17.3% efficiency enabled by doping the NiOX with Li. Our results show that progressively increasing the doping concentration transforms the photoresistor behavior to a typical diode curve, with an increase in the average efficiency from 2.53% to 16.03% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.22 V. Analysis reveals that Li doping of NiOX significantly improves the morphology, crystallinity, and orientation of 2D perovskite films and also affords a superior band alignment, facilitating efficient charge extraction. Finally, we demonstrate that 2D PSCs with Li-doped NiOX exhibit excellent photostability, with T99 = 400 h at 1 sun and T90 of 100 h at 5 suns measured at relative humidity of 60% ± 5% without the need for external thermal management.

Abstract: The adherence to accreditation programs proves the institutions' voluntary effort to pursue the quality and safety of their products and services by meeting internationally accepted standards audited by experts in the field, external to the service. Meeting such standards often exceeds domestic legal requirements. However, service providers are not released from complying with the legal requirements, both local and international, pertinent to the field. Accreditation programs use the precepts of the quality management system to validate and standardize processes, monitor results through quality control, proficiency testing, and indicators, and perform risk management. For cellular therapy services, the assessing agencies available in our field are the AABB/ABHH (American Association of Blood Banks/Brazilian Association of Hematology, Hemotherapy and Cellular Therapy) and FACT-JACIE (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy-Joint Accreditation Committee, ISCT/EBMT). Both agencies require that the accredited organization meets all the standards defined in each program. Applying services also have to establish and comply with a quality management standard that demonstrates procedural interrelationship to ensure product and service quality. This paper aims to concisely outline the essential features of those two accreditation programs, along with a brief overview of the accreditation process under each of them.

Abstract: Summary
In the era of artificial intelligence, photonic artificial synapses that are capable of light detection and information storage are attracting much attention, although complex device configuration and high energy consumption are two remaining challenges. Here, a flexible polymer-based optical synapse for infrared light detection in the absence of applied voltage is fabricated to emulate human synaptic photoplasticity. Investigation into the mechanism of the self-powered properties demonstrates that both the localized electric field of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and the high dielectric constant of narrow-band conjugated polymer contribute to spontaneous exciton dissociation. Moreover, array imaging and data encryption are achieved by modulating light for the flexible devices, which exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility and long-term air stability. Thus, this work may provide a strategy to develop self-powered artificial synapses for infrared light detection.

Abstract: Summary
Biology is replete with soft mechanisms of potential use for robotics. Here, we report that a soft, toroidal hydrostat can be used to perform three functions found in both living and engineered systems: gripping, catching, and conveying. We demonstrate a gripping mechanism that uses a tubular inversion to encapsulate objects within a crumpled elastic membrane under hydrostatic pressure. This mechanism produces gripping forces that depend predictably upon the geometric and materials properties of the system. We next demonstrate a catching mechanism akin to that of a chameleon’s tongue: the elasticity of the membrane is used to power a catapulting inversion process (≈400 m/s2) to capture flying objects (e.g., a bouncing ball). Finally, we demonstrate a conveying mechanism that passes objects through the center of the toroidal tube (∼1 cm/s) using a continuous inversion-eversion process. The hybrid hard-soft mechanisms presented here can be applied toward the integration of soft functionality into robotic systems.

Abstract: Summary
Development of highly sensitive, stable, and repeatable surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates is crucial for analytical detection, which is a challenge for traditional metallic structures. Here, by exploiting the high surface activity of the 1T′ transition metal telluride, we fabricate high-density gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that are prepared spontaneously in situ on the 1T′ MoTe2 atomic layers, forming a plasmonic-2D material hybrid SERS substrate. This AuNP formation is unique to the 1T′ phase, which is repressed in 2H MoTe2 with lower surface activity. The hybrid structure generates coupling effects of electromagnetic and chemical enhancements, as well as excellent molecule adsorption, leading to ultrasensitive (4 × 10−17 M) and reproducible detection. Flexible SERS tapes are demonstrated in practical applications. Our approach facilitates ultrasensitive SERS detection by a facile method, as well as an enhanced mechanistic understanding of SERS beyond plasmonic effects.

Abstract: Summary
Protein transfer into nanoscale compartments is critical for many cellular/life processes, yet there are few reports on how compartment properties impact the protein orientation during a transfer. Such a knowledge gap limits a deeper understanding of the protein transfer mechanism, which could be bridged using nanoporous materials. Here, we use a mesoporous silica, a covalent organic framework, and a metal-organic framework with charged, hydrophobic, and neutral surfaces, respectively, to elucidate the impact of channel properties on the transfer of a model protein, lysozyme. Using site-directed spin labeling and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we reveal that the transfer can be a multi-step process depending on channel properties and depict the relative orientation changes of lysozyme upon transfer into each channel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structural insight into protein orientation upon transfer into different compartments, meaningful for the rational design of synthetic materials to host enzymes or mimic the cellular compartments.

Abstract: Patients with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or present mild to severe symptoms, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular complications and death. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity are considered risk factors for COVID-19 poor prognosis. In parallel, COVID-19 severe patients exhibit dyslipidemia and alterations in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) associated with disease severity and mortality. To investigate whether such alterations are caused by the infection or results from preexisting comorbidities, this work analyzed dyslipidemia and the hemogram profile of COVID-19 patients according to the severity and compared with patients without T2DM or obesity comorbidities. Dyslipidemia, with a marked decrease in HDL levels, and increased NLR accompanied the disease severity, even in non-T2DM and non-obese patients, indicating that COVID-19 causes the observed alterations. Because decreased hemoglobin is involved in COVID-19 severity, and hemoglobin concentration is associated with metabolic diseases, the erythrogram of patients was also evaluated. We verified a drop in hemoglobin and erythrocyte number in severe patients, independently of T2DM and obesity, which may explain in part the need for artificial ventilation in severe cases. Thus, the control of such parameters (especially HDL levels, NLR, and hemoglobin concentration) could be a good strategy to prevent COVID-19 complications and death.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroin monoliths, produced by compression molding starting from the protein powder, are known to achieve an impressive mechanical strength when tested in dry conditions. However, in the presence of water, the loss of structural integrity and mechanical performances is striking. Considering the bone scaffold applications for which this material is intended, this remarkable weakening after implantation strongly limits its usage to non-structural purposes. Here, we propose an approach that allows the recovery of mechanical properties and the retention of the shape in physiological conditions, due to a progressive chemical crosslinking triggered by genipin and humidity. Crosslinking does not hinder cell adhesion and proliferation, as suggested by a preliminary biological test, nor does it limit the machinability of the material, as demonstrated by producing complex-shaped objects through laser cutting. Overall, genipin-crosslinked solid fibroin is a reliable material that may be suitable for structural applications in physiological conditions.

Abstract: Abnormally high serum ferritin levels have been reported during pediatric ECMO, attributed to frequent red blood cell transfusion and suggestive of iron overload. However, the utility of ferritin for diagnosing iron overload is complicated by its response as an acute-phase reactant. In this study, we aimed to assess the utility of ferritin for diagnosing ECMO-related iron overload, with secondary aims of understanding its relationship with inflammation and erythropoiesis. Ferritin was elevated in all pediatric ECMO runs (median 459 ng/ml, IQR = 327.3–694.4). While intermittent elevations in serum iron were observed, all normalized prior to decannulation. Unreported previously, erythropoietin (EPO) remained well above normative values prior to and throughout ECMO runs, despite frequent transfusion and exposure to hyperoxia. Ferritin correlated poorly with serum iron [r(80) = 0.05, p = 0.65], but correlated well with IL-6 [r(76) = 0.48, p < 0.001] and EPO [r(81) = 0.55, p < 0.001]. We suggest that serum ferritin is a poor biomarker of iron overload in ECMO patients, and that future investigation into its relationship with EPO is warranted.

Abstract: Growing evidence places tissue-resident macrophages as essential gatekeepers of metabolic organ homeostasis, including the adipose tissue and the pancreatic islets. Therein, macrophages may adopt specific phenotypes and ensure local functions. Recent advances in single cell genomic analyses provide a comprehensive map of adipose tissue macrophage subsets and their potential roles are now better apprehended. Whether they are beneficial or detrimental, macrophages overall contribute to the proper adipose tissue expansion under steady state and during obesity. By contrast, macrophages residing inside pancreatic islets, which may exert fundamental functions to fine tune insulin secretion, have only started to attract attention and their cellular heterogeneity remains to be established. The present review will focus on the latest findings exploring the phenotype and the properties of macrophages in adipose tissue and pancreatic islets, questioning early beliefs and future perspectives in the field of immunometabolism.

Abstract: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) can occur as a hemolytic form or small PNH clone found in a patient with bone marrow failure.
Methods
Describe Brazilian retrospective PNH cohort and identify the impact of disease burden on long-term follow-up.
Results
167 patients, mean age at diagnosis 28.4 (7.1–71.2 years), four years mean interval between onset of cytopenia/aplasia diagnosis and PNH clone detection. Patients were divided into 15 Classic PNH, 55 Hemolytic PNH with bone marrow hypoplasia (PNH/AA), and 97 Subclinical PNH (sc-PNH). Hypocellular bone marrow was found in 89.2%; 55 had hemoglobinuria and 22 thrombosis during monitoring. WBC PNH clone correlated with RBC PNH clone, LDH and cytopenia. Subclinical patients had lower median lower RBC clone (2.0% vs 24.0% vs 57.8%) and WBC clone (11.7% vs 58.8% vs 81.2%) than PNH/AA and Classic PNH, respectively. PNH granulocyte clone was 89.1% in thrombotic patients. Ten-year overall survival 80.4% and mortality in transplanted patients 9.6%. Sepsis was mortality cause in subclinical PNH (16/18, 88.8%), and thrombosis in hemolytic PNH (11/13, 84.6%).
Conclusion
Large PNH clones and LDH burden were associated with increased hemolysis and thrombosis risks, while young patients were associated with small PNH clones and subclinical form of the disease. Knowledge of the patient profile, the low risk associated with HSCT, and the use of long-term IST may be instrumental in the clinical management of PNH in restricted-resources countries.

Abstract: Summary
Realizing photovoltaic devices that achieve the full potential of the metal halide perovskite material will require improved insight regarding the role of selective contacts and how key interfaces operate when mobile defects are present. However, measuring interface properties in typical device stacks where the perovskite layer is thin and sandwiched between two contacts has been a challenge. Here, we fabricate p-i-n and p-n lateral heterojunctions with nickel oxide/titanium oxide all back contacts, permitting us to employ a comprehensive analysis approach, including ultraviolet and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (UPS/XPS), angle-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), surface photovoltage (SPV), hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and time-resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (TR-FLIM) to discern the role of selective contacts. Specifically, we tune the selectivity of the contacts, changing the gradient in the carrier concentration across the surface of the active layer, which is connected to carrier extraction at the buried interface, and thus the device functionality.

Abstract: Summary
Electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface passivation is particularly challenging because of the use of polar solvents (e.g., DMF) for perovskite solution deposition, which usually destroy the bottom as-formed defect passivation layers. Herein, a novel multifunctional composite ETL, NH2-ZnO@SnO2, is prepared by mixing amino-capped ZnO (NH2-ZnO) nanocrystals (NCs) with SnO2 nanoparticles. The best-performing PSCs on the basis of NH2-ZnO@SnO2 achieve efficiency of 22.52%, which is significantly higher than that of the pristine SnO2 counterpart (18.45%). The enhanced performance of the NH2-ZnO@SnO2 ETL can be attributed to higher electron extraction capacity, better energy-level alignment with perovskite material, and more efficient carrier transport in device. Most important, the NH2 groups on the surface of ZnO NCs can effectively passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ ions from perovskite films, thus reducing charge recombination at ETL/perovskite interface. The results suggest that NH2-ZnO NCs@SnO2 composite is a promising ETL for improving the performance of PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Biological screens are plagued by false-positive hits resulting from aggregation. Methods to triage small colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs) are in high demand. Herein, we disclose a neural network to flag such entities. Our data demonstrate the utility of machine learning for predicting SCAMs, achieving 80% of correct predictions in an out-of-sample evaluation. The tool is competitive with a panel of expert chemists, who correctly predict 61% ± 7% of the same molecules in a Turing-like test. Our computational routine provides insight into features governing aggregation that had remained hidden to expert intuition. Further, we quantify that up to 15%–20% of ligands in publicly available chemogenomic databases have high potential to aggregate at a typical screening concentration (30 μM), imposing caution in systems biology and drug design programs. Our approach provides a means to augment human intuition and mitigate attrition and a pathway to accelerate future molecular medicine.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput manufacturing of hybrid halide perovskite solar cells is the next challenge before they enter the market. An anti-solvent bath is generally required to control the perovskite film assembly starting from precursors in solution. Although an anti-solvent bath has proven feasible for roll-to-roll deposition, it implies an undoubted increased complexity of the manufacturing line, meaning enhanced costs for the process itself and anti-solvent disposal. Here, we take advantage of the use of a starch polymer as a rheological modifier in perovskite precursor solutions to avoid the anti-solvent bath. Starch allows for control of the perovskite growth process in one step and reach of required viscosities for gravure-printing technique with ∼50% less of the raw precursor materials. This combined with simplified processing conditions are expected to drastically lower the costs of perovskite material production. We demonstrate that this approach can be upscaled to roll-to-roll gravure printing of flexible solar cells, reaching a maximum power conversion efficiency close to 10%.

Abstract: Summary
The strong but narrow-bandwidth absorption spectra of organic semiconductors make them excellent candidates for semi-transparent solar cell applications in which color specificity is important. In this study, using a hybrid heterojunction combining the transparent inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) with organic semiconductors (C70, PC70BM, C60, ITIC, IT-4F, or Y6), we show that simple color-tunable solar cells can be fabricated in which the transmission spectrum is determined solely by choice of the organic semiconductor. Using a joint electrical-optical model, we show that it is possible to combine the unique attributes of high photovoltage and color tunability to use these heterojunctions as photovoltaic windows in tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC)-photovoltaic (PV) cells. We demonstrate that this configuration can lead to a reduction in the parasitic absorption losses in the PEC-PV cells and, thus, to solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies (>3%) that are higher than that predicted using the traditionally used architecture in which the PV is placed behind the PEC.

Abstract: Summary
High-nickel layered oxide Li-ion batteries (LIBs) dominate the electric vehicle market, but their potentially poor safety and thermal stability remain a public concern. Here, we show that an ultrahigh-energy LIB (292 Wh kg−1) becomes intrinsically safer when a small amount of triallyl phosphate (TAP) is added to standard electrolytes. TAP passivates the electrode-electrolyte interfaces and limits the maximum cell temperature during nail penetration to 55°C versus complete cell destruction (>950°C) without TAP. The downside of this reliable safety solution is higher interfacial impedance and hence lower battery power; however, thermal modulation for battery operation around 60°C can restore power completely. When cycled at 60°C, the cell stabilized with TAP achieved 2,413 cycles at 76% capacity retention. Such an unconventional combination of interface-passivating electrolyte additive with cell thermal modulation renders the most energy-dense LIBs even safer than LiFePO4 chemistry, while enjoying high power and cycling stability concurrently.

Abstract: Summary
The necessity of ultrapure water and water-transport infrastructure pose grand challenges in renewable-energy-assisted water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. Directly accessing atmospheric water should offer a decisive solution because it provides ∼13 trillion kiloliters of pure water at any given instant. We show that the central challenge for atmospheric water electrolysis is related to the water-sorption kinetics of the proton-conducting membrane where state-of-the-art membranes critically fail. A proof-of-concept atmospheric water electrolyzer is demonstrated with a graphene oxide proton-conducting membrane, which has nearly three times higher water-sorption kinetics and ten times higher hydration number than a Nafion membrane due to capillary water condensation and the abundant presence of hydrophilic functionalities. At a wind velocity of ∼50 km/h, this electrolyzer delivers nearly 18 mL/h/cm2 of green hydrogen directly from the feedstock of atmospheric water. Because this electrolyzer does not require water-transport infrastructure, it can be placed almost anywhere, which offers opportunities for decentralized green hydrogen production.

Abstract: Summary
Irreversible structure evolution of electrode in the battery always leads to structure collapse and the lost activation of active material. To overcome this technical challenge, synchronous electrochemical reconstruction method is proposed. Herein, as a proof of concept, Bi2Se3 nanosheets are synthesized. It shows an outstanding electrochemical performance as the anode of sodium-ion battery, which is benefitted by structure evolution of Bi2Se3 electrode. More importantly, Cu element deriving from the current collector is detected, which plays a crucial role in this evolution, promoting the electrochemical reconstruction and stabilizing selenium element. The role of Cu is further verified by the Se powder anode. The reconstructed anode from Bi2Se3 nanosheet or pure selenium can not only provide a stable structure but also ensure a faster electronic and ionic diffusion channel, leading to an excellent cyclic and rate performance. Therefore, the reconstruction strategy will be a promising way for the design of electrode with high performance.

Abstract: Summary
Oxygen redox reactions (ORRs) are considered a new strategy in reaching a high-energy density for rechargeable batteries. Here, we propose the concept “band coherency” for identifying the origin of reversible ORRs in alkali-excess compounds, i.e., Na2RuO3 and Li2RuO3. Band coherency redox chemistry exhibits non-discrete transition metal (TM) nd–O 2p electron activity. This can be explained by the charge variations of O and Ru, including thermodynamic-phase stability. After the cation-based redox reaction (Ru4+/Ru5+), a dominant ORR, accompanied by the partial Ru-redox reaction, takes place in the band-coherency region. Subsequently, pure anion redox through oxygen occurs. This three-step redox mechanism is consistent with the electrochemical behavior of the oxygen-redox-tuned cathodes, until the band-coherency region shows great ORR reversibility. Triggering band coherency is a rational-design principle in using ORRs, excluding pure anionic activity and maintaining their high-energy-density properties upon cycling for the next generation of alkali-ion batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Garnet-type solid electrolytes have attracted extensive attention for solid-state lithium (Li) batteries. However, the high processing temperature of up to 1,200°C limits large-scale production. Here, we report a simple approach to reduce the sintering temperature by using a conformal nanoscale amorphous alumina coating. The ceramic sintered at 980°C shows a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 0.13 mS cm−1. It reveals that the second phases segregated at grain boundaries are ionically conductive but electronically blocking, which can block electronic conduction and improve mechanical property. The Li symmetry cells indicate a long-term 2,500-cycle life and a high critical current density of 0.52 mA cm−2. The garnet electrolyte enables the high-voltage cells using Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 to deliver a high specific capacity of 248 mAh g−1 at 0.05 C. This work provides a new clue for lowering sintering temperature for garnet electrolytes, which can extend to other ceramics toward practical applications.

Abstract: N-linked glycosylation is a post-translational modification crucial for membrane protein folding, stability and other cellular functions. Alteration of membrane protein N-glycans is implicated in wide range of pathological conditions including cancer metastasis, chronic inflammatory diseases, and viral pathogenesis. Even though the roles of N-glycans have been studied extensively, our knowledge of their mechanisms remains unclear due to the lack of detailed structural analysis of the N-glycome. Mapping the N-glycome landscape will open new avenues to explore disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. This review discusses the diverse structure of N-linked glycans, the function and regulation of N-glycosylation in health and disease, and ends with a focus on recent approaches to target N-glycans in rheumatoid arthritis and cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
The catalytic and stereoselective synthesis of P-stereogenic compounds has drawn a lot of attention, since these compounds possess widespread applications in organic synthesis. Thus, novel strategies for the construction of new complex P-chiral molecules still need to be developed. Here, we report a highly enantioselective synthesis of P-stereogenic N-vinylphosphonamides using an asymmetric allylic substitution-isomerization (AASI) strategy. The efficient catalytic approach provides rapid access to a wide range of enantioenriched N-vinylphosphonamides in up to 85% yields and 99:1 enantiomeric ratio. Computational studies demonstrate that the P-stereogenic center induces more favorable π-π stacking interactions in N-vinylphosphonamides.

Abstract: Summary
Bromine is attractive for next-generation energy-storage systems because of its high capacity and natural abundance. However, because of issues relating to self-discharging processes, prototypes involving bromide/bromine redox couples are largely limited to the design of flow cells. Here we propose a method to exploit bromine redox chemistry and demonstrate the feasibility of mitigating ion depletion in a stationary device. A cell using polyaniline vapor-grown carbon fiber (PANI-VGCF) as the electrode material exhibits close to 100% Coulombic efficiency at a low current density (50 mA/g). Electrochemical results, operando Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical analysis provide clues that the strong interaction between protonated PANI and Br−/ Br3− makes their decoupling unfavorable, thereby suppressing self-discharge processes. This strategy could be utilized for rational design of other conjugated materials/bromine systems without self-discharge issues.

Abstract: Summary
Naturally structural and chemical interface instability between solid-state electrolyte (SSE) and Li anode is still a bottleneck for the suppression of Li dendrites to date. Herein, we design the 3D in situ-fluorinated perovskite-type electrolyte hybridized with poly (ethylene oxide) fibers (F-LLTO@PEO) for the synergistically enhanced physicochemical-interface stability. The rapidly Li-ions-transporting and high shear modulus 3D skeleton-structured SSE can physically suppress Li dendrite growth, while the LiF-rich solid-state electrolyte interface (SEI) layer of the in situ fluoridated SSE can chemically eliminate the security risk of Li dendrites. This unique SSE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25°C. Based on the above, the as-developed solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) possess excellent rate-capability of 95 mAh g−1 @ 5 C and cycling stability over 80% after 100 cycles at 90°C. Evidently, this physicochemically dendrite-suppressed strategy will open a previously unexplored opportunity in developing safe, high-performance SSLMBs.

Abstract: Summary
Signal sequences are short peptides at the N terminus of proteins destined for the secretion pathway. Typically, after cleavage by peptidases, signal peptides are degraded by intra-membrane proteases. In some cases, however, signal peptides can be processed further and released into the endoplasmic reticulum, secretion pathways, or cytoplasm. The consequences of these processes remain unclear, in particular considering that dysregulated signal peptides could potentially aggregate and induce cytotoxicity. To investigate this problem, we study the signal peptide of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which originates the Alzheimer’s β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide. Our results show that this signal peptide (residues 1–17 of APP [APP1–17SP]) can form amyloid-like cytotoxic aggregates. We further demonstrate that APP1–17SP seeds promote aggregation of Aβ, which raises the intriguing possibility of an interplay between APP1–17SP and Aβ aggregation in disease processes.

Abstract: Summary
Although bismuth (Bi)-based halide perovskites have attracted profound attention in photocatalysis, the undesirable photophysical properties are not well modulated, and the effect of surface structure on adsorption and activation of reactant molecules is still unclear. Here, we report the structural design, via precise incorporation of antimony (Sb) atoms into the host lattice of Cs3Bi2Br9, of a series of B-site bimetallic perovskites (Cs3SbxBi2-xBr9, 0 ≤ x ≤ 2) with tunable band structures. The incorporation of Sb dramatically enhances the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges and prolongs their lifetimes. Considering these advantages, Cs3SbBiBr9 exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activities in challenging benzylic C–H activation while maintaining a high selectivity of 96%. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Sb breaks the symmetry of the local structure and leads to asymmetric charge distribution that not only increases the adsorption capacity for methylbenzene but also reduces the energy barriers for C–H bond activation.

Abstract: Summary
Ammonia occupies a significant standing in the global economy. As a promising alternative to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, electrochemical nitrogen reduction could achieve sustainable ammonia synthesis. However, the attractive alternative suffers from the bottleneck of insufficient activity and low electron selectivity. Here, we report an efficient electrocatalyst using phosphotungstic acid as platforms to anchor bismuth species on the 4-fold hollow site and anchor lithium species on the 3-fold hollow site, which reaches high ammonia yield rates of 61 ± 1 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and Faradaic efficiencies of 85% ± 2% at −0.1 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the Biδ+ species can promote the activation and hydrogenation of nitrogen at adjacent unsaturated tungsten active sites, and the incorporated lithium species reduce the hydrogen reduction rate in undesired water splitting. This synergistic functionalization of bismuth and lithium species contributes to the high-efficient catalyst.

Abstract: Summary
Mini- and micro-light-emitting diodes (mini/micro-LEDs) are an ideal technology platform for display and bioelectronic applications. For mini/micro-LEDs based on III-V semiconductors, the requirements for high-quality epitaxy and mass transfer are demanding, raising barriers for production yields and costs. Perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) are an emerging alternative to conventional LEDs. However, the options for creating non-epitaxial mini/micro-LEDs by miniaturizing the pixel areas of PeLEDs are limited. Here, we demonstrate efficient single-pixel PeLEDs with active areas from 500 × 200 μm2 to 100 × 200 μm2, showing external quantum efficiencies of up to 9.1%. Key to this demonstration is 2-fold. First, a nanometer-thin lithium fluoride (LiF) interlayer allows surface tension relief within the microscopic device structure, enabling robust integration of high-efficiency PeLED architectures with self-aligned photolithography. Second, preparing uniform and highly luminescent perovskite layers are critical as the active area enters the micrometer regime. Our work paves the way toward next-generation micro-PeLED applications.

Abstract: Summary
With numerous reports on protecting films for stable lithium (Li) metal electrodes, the key attributes for how to construct these efficient layers have rarely been fully investigated. Here, we report a rationally designed hybrid protective layer (HPL) with each component aligning with one key attribute; i.e., cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) enhances flexibility, polyethylene glycol (PEG) provides homogeneous ion-conducting channels, and glass fiber (GF) affords mechanical robustness. A significant improvement of the electrochemical performance of HPL-modified electrodes can be achieved in Li/HPL@Cu half cells, HPL@Li/HPL@Li symmetric cells, and HPL@Li/LiFePO4 full cells. Even with an industrial standard LiFePO4 cathode (96.8 wt % active material), the assembled cell still exhibits a capacity retention of 90% after 100 cycles at 1 C. More importantly, the functionality of each component has been studied comprehensively via electrochemical and physical experiments and simulations, which will provide useful guidance on how to construct efficient protective layers for next-generation energy storage devices.

Abstract: Summary
The production of fuels from lignocellulosic biomass is key to reduce our reliance on petroleum and to promote a sustainable bioeconomy. Butyric acid (BA) is a promising chemical precursor for the production of renewable diesel and jet fuels. BA can be biologically produced from lignocellulosic sugars. However, challenges associated with product selectivity and recovery must be overcome to achieve industrially relevant metrics. Here, we evaluate various fermentation configurations and demonstrate near-homo-butyrate production by using the biocatalyst Clostridium tyrobutyricum. We also develop an advanced in situ product recovery process based on hybrid extraction-distillation (HED-ISPR) and conduct techno-economic analyses and life cycle assessments. We demonstrate that the HED-ISPR process lowers the overall capital and operating expenses and environmental impact compared to other traditional fermentation processes. Overall, BA minimum product selling price from biomass is 55% of the current BA selling price from petroleum, a significant decrease toward viable renewable fuel production.

Abstract: Summary
The capability to build up stable, switchable catalysts for complex artificial systems that can mimic the responsiveness of biological systems to multiple triggers is highly desirable and challenging. Herein, we engineer such a system by physically locking catalytically active metal clusters (MCs) inside individual cationic molecular organic cages (I-Cages), where the responsive and task-specific counteranions of I-Cages impart MCs with a programmable gating effect. This allows for precise spatial and temporal control over chemical reactions by regulating accessibility of reagents to the MC sites. Following this strategy, we have successfully tailored catalytic activity of a series of model catalysis (e.g., methanolysis of ammonia borane, and the reduction of 4-nitroaniline) by employing light and pH stimuli, as well as their combination, for programmable-activity control.

Abstract: Summary
Protection from nerve agents is an important societal challenge requiring effective strategies for rapid degradation of these toxic chemicals. Here, we report a series of zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)—NU-912 and its derivatives—with a 4,8-connected scu topology. We explore their activity toward degradation of a nerve agent simulant, dimethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP), to illustrate the virtues of controlling functional group distribution and regulating the environment across the micropore in heterogeneous catalysis. The micropore environments of these MOFs tuned by functional groups (-Br, -CN, -I, and -NH2) have significant influence on catalytic activity. NU-912-I, NU-912-CN, and NU-912-NH2 have half-lives (t1/2) of less than 3 min using only 3 mol % catalyst loading, which places them among the best zirconium (Zr)-MOF-based heterogeneous catalysts for hydrolysis of DMNP.

Abstract: Summary
The air-stable layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se has recently attracted extensive interest because of its potential application in electronics, optoelectronics, ferroelectrics, and thermoelectrics. For many of these applications, thermal transport in Bi2O2Se is of great importance, but a complete understanding of the process remains elusive. Here, we perform a combined experimental and theoretical study of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of single-crystalline Bi2O2Se in comparison with Bi2Se3. Bi2O2Se exhibits relatively higher through-plane thermal conductivity but lower in-plane thermal conductivity, resulting in substantially smaller thermal anisotropy. This behavior originates from the stronger interlayer electrostatic interaction in Bi2O2Se compared with the typical van der Waals coupling in layered materials, making the phonon isoenergy surfaces less anisotropic and, thus, weakening phonon focusing in the in-plane directions. Our study advances the fundamental understanding of thermal anisotropy in layered materials with various interlayer interactions and will facilitate application of Bi2O2Se in electronics and thermoelectrics.

Abstract: The molecular identity of Psickle, the deoxygenation-activated cation conductance of the human sickle erythrocyte, remains unknown. We observed in human sickle red cells that inhibitors of TRPA1 and TRPV1 inhibited Psickle, whereas a TRPV1 agonist activated a Psickle-like cation current. These observations prompted us to test the roles of TRPV1 and TRPA1 in Psickle in red cells of the SAD mouse model of sickle cell disease. We generated SAD mice genetically deficient in either TRPV1 or TRPA1. SAD;Trpv1−/− and SAD;Trpa1−/− mice were indistinguishable in appearance, hematological indices, and osmotic fragility from SAD mice. We found that deoxygenation-activated cation currents remained robust in SAD;Trpa1−/− and SAD;Trpv1−/− mice. In addition, 45Ca2+ influx into SAD mouse red cells during prolonged deoxygenation was not reduced in red cells from SAD;Trpa1−/− and SAD;Trpv1−/− mice. We conclude that the nonspecific cation channels TRPA1 and TRPV1 are not required for deoxygenation to stimulate Psickle-like activity in red cells of the SAD mouse model of sickle cell disease.

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), especially against CD19 marker, present in lymphomas and acute B leukemia, enabled a revolution in the treatment of hematologic neoplastic diseases. The manufacture of CAR-T cells requires the adoption of GMP-compatible methods and it demands the collection of mononuclear cells from the patient (or from the donor), generally through the apheresis procedure, T cell selection, activation, transduction and expansion ex vivo, and finally storage, usually cryopreserved, until the moment of their use. An important aspect is the quality control testing of the final product, for example, the characterization of its identity and purity, tests to detect any contamination by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma) and its potency. The product thawing and intravenous infusion do not differ much from what is established for the hematopoietic progenitor cell product. After infusion, it is important to check for the presence and concentration of CAR-T cells in the patient's peripheral blood, as well as to monitor their clinical impact, for instance, the occurrence of short-term, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurological complications, and long-term complications, which require patient follow-up for many years.

Abstract: Summary
The growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has become a serious threat to human health. Loading single atoms onto carbon-based materials is a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly and stable photothermal antibacterial nanomaterials. We report the successful synthesis of carbon black nanomaterials doped with copper single atoms, nickel single atoms, and gold single atoms of similar mass concentration guided by theoretical calculations. The introduction of metal single atoms fundamentally changed the electronic structure of the original carbon black and resulted in high photothermal properties and antibacterial activity. Among these antimicrobial materials, the copper-doped material is more active than the other two, which is consistent with our theoretical calculations. Also, the combination of theoretical calculations and experimental validation suggests an intrinsic mechanism of bactericidal activity. This strategy has the potential to be extended to other single-atom doped systems with improved photothermal properties.

Abstract: Summary
Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is emerging as a burgeoning mode of medical treatment and is widely adopted in practical clinical operations. Here, we report a soft manipulator that can actively deform and navigate through a narrow and constrained environment. Stiffness tunability, tremor filtration, and motion scaling capabilities are incorporated to ensure the position and posture of the manipulator during operation. Based on teleoperation through a handle shank, we demonstrate the capability of navigating through a complex, constrained, and narrow space of the human skeleton. By attaching a camera and syringe needle at the front tip of the soft manipulator, the capability of acupuncture treatment and in vivo drug delivery in a medical mannequin is further demonstrated. Finally, autonomous recognition and tracking systems are developed to ensure the surgeon can effortlessly teleoperate the soft manipulator to enter the human body.

Abstract: Summary
Edward Teller was the first to show that it would be possible for self-propagating fission waves to form in fertile nuclear materials. It is typically assumed that these waves would be asymptotically stable. However, we show here that coupling of the neutron field to the 239U->239Np->239Pu decay chain can lead to a Hopf bifurcation. The fission reaction then ramps up and down, along with the wave velocity. Time-dependent results are obtained using a numerical implementation of a reaction-diffusion model for a fast neutron field. A linear stability analysis of the underlying equations and the full system isotopics confirms the results and shows the parameter space over which the Hopf occurs.

Abstract: Summary
Electrocatalysis-assisted entrapment of polysulfide while ensuring efficient nucleation of Na2S holds the key to addressing the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics of polysulfide in room-temperature (RT) Na/S batteries. The constrained active sites, however, dramatically limit the efficiency of electrocatalysts. Here, a strategy of electrochemically releasing nano-silver catalytic sites during the discharge process is presented, visualized, and implemented for accelerated Na2S nucleation. Because of the effective polysulfide immobilization and accelerated Na2S nucleation, the sulfur cathode, supported by a self-released silver electrocatalyst, exhibits a superior reversible capacity of 701 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and an ultra-stable cycling performance. Precise understanding of the electrochemically self-releasing mechanism and the catalysis in Na2S nucleation via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) would aid, however, in fundamentally optimizing the working mechanism and for further development of more stable high-power RT Na/S batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Electron transfer between solid and gas phases in saline is of vital importance to electricity supply, energy storage and conversion, and catalysis. In most cases, seawater does not contribute greatly to the electron transfer process. Here we report a strategy to generate porous fluid by dispersing nanoporous coordination polymer into the seawater. In situ ultraviolet-visible and electrochemical spectroscopy confirms that the porous seawater fluid mediates electron transfer between the solid donor and the dissolved oxygen. The key factors in accelerating electron transfer are found to be (1) the porous electrode, (2) the connection between the porous seawater and the environmental air, and (3) the dynamic condition of the fluid. Enhanced electron transfer between the alloy and the dissolved oxygen leads to an efficient ocean electricity supply strategy based on the porous seawater fluid.

Abstract: Summary
To meet the increasing demand for highly efficient heat dissipation in power electronics, a heat spreader that has significantly greater isotropic thermal conductivity than the commonly used copper (400 W/m·K) should be developed. Although graphite is a promising candidate because of its high basal-plane thermal conductivity, its application is restricted by its low c axis thermal conductivity. This issue can be resolved by transforming graphite into an isotropic thermal conductor by building a structure that can effectively route heat in all three dimensions. Herein, we develop a double-decker structure with differently oriented graphite layers to realize high heat dissipation from a local heat source. The critical issue of bonding the graphite layers is overcome by a high-temperature process using Cu as the binding layer. The graphite/Cu composite efficiently dissipates heat nearly isotropically and performs as well as an isotropic conductor with a thermal conductivity of 900 W/m·K.

Abstract: Summary
Thermal energy storage (TES) based on phase-change materials (PCMs) has many current and potential applications, such as climate control in buildings, thermal management for batteries and electronics, thermal textiles, and transportation of pharmaceuticals. Despite its promise, the adoption of TES has been limited, in part due to limited tunability of the transition temperature, which hinders TES performance for varying use temperatures. Transition temperature tuning of a material using an external stimulus, such as pressure or an electric field, typically requires very large stimuli. To circumvent this problem, here, we report on the dynamic transition temperature tunability of a PCM using ions. We achieve a transition temperature tunability up to 6°C in polyethylene glycol (PEG) by using the salt lithium oxalatodifluoroborate at a low voltage of 2.5 V, which may enable simpler and safer devices/system designs. We also explain the thermal properties of the salt/PCM solution using the Flory-Huggins theory.

Fluorescent anti-counterfeiting technology has been widely reported for its advantages, such as easy identification and multiple anti-counterfeiting functions. Most of the current fluorescent anti-counterfeiting materials focus on the innovation of anti-counterfeiting mode. However, stability is a prerequisite for applying anti-counterfeiting materials and determining whether a material can be widely used. Inspired by water stains, we report fluorescent nanoparticles that are easily prepared and inkjet printable and have multiple anti-counterfeiting functions and high stability. They are applied successfully to fluorescent anti-counterfeiting. 3D printed microreactors prepared the fluorescent nanoparticles with different emission wavelengths. The nanoparticles adhere firmly to the fibers of paper or cloth under the combined effect of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. The sample paper exhibits good tolerance to extreme environments, such as boiling water, liquid nitrogen, photobleaching, and strong acid. Finally, multiple anti-counterfeiting functions are realized by mobile phones and clustering algorithms.

Abstract: Summary
Concepts in sodium oxide cathode composite structures have captured widespread attention; however, the detailed monitoring and accurate control of composite structural evolution during charge and discharge process remain challenging, especially for complex triphases and other similar systems. Here, we report the accurate manipulation of multiphase structural evolution during high-voltage cycling with improved electrochemical performance and adjustable sodium ion intercalation/deintercalation electrochemical behavior via rational chemical element substitution using a series of Fd-3m spinel and layered P2/P3 heterostructures as proof-of-concept materials. Multiphase evolutions as a function of chemical substitution during high-voltage cycling are demonstrated. Meanwhile, we also monitor the dynamic formation process during calcination and observe the atomic arrangement of triphase heterostructure through various advanced characterization techniques. Overall, this study reveals controllable multiphase structural evolution in a model system and explores the related fundamental science required for future development of high-performance sodium-ion batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Due to the highly complex polyphenolic structure of lignin, depolymerization without a prior chemical treatment is challenging, and new catalysts are required. Atomically dispersed catalysts are able to maximize the atomic efficiency of noble metals, simultaneously providing an alternative strategy to tune the activity and selectivity by alloying with other abundant metal supports. Here, we report a highly active and selective catalyst comprising monodispersed (single) Pt atoms on Ni nanoparticles supported on carbon (denoted as Pt1Ni/C, where Pt1 represents single Pt atoms), designed for the reductive depolymerization of lignin. Selectivity toward 4-n-propylsyringol and 4-n-propylguaiacol exceeds 90%. The activity and selectivity of the Pt1Ni/C catalyst in the reductive depolymerization of lignin may be attributed to synergistic effects between the Ni nanoparticles and the single Pt atoms.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium (Li)-metal is considered as promising anode material for high-energy-density rechargeable batteries, although its application is hampered by inhomogeneous Li deposition and dendritic Li morphologies that could eventually result in contact losses of bulk and deposited Li as well as cell short circuits. Based on theoretical investigations, recent works on polymer electrolytes particularly focus on the design of single-ion conducting electrolytes and improvement of bulk Li+ transport properties, including enhanced Li+ transference numbers, ionic conductivity, and mechanical stability, thereby affording safer and potentially “dendrite-free” cycling of Li-metal batteries. In the present work, it is revealed that the spatial microstructures, localized chemistry, and corresponding distributions of properties within the electrolyte are also decisive for achieving superior cell performances. Thus, targeted modification of the electrolyte microstructures should be considered as further critical design parameters for future electrolyte development and to actually control Li deposition behavior and longevity of Li-metal batteries.

Abstract: Glucocorticoid treatment is the standard initial therapy for patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Despite a rate of 60–80% of initial remissions, only 30 to 50% of adults have a sustained response after discontinuation. Second line options are splenectomy, thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin. Third line treatments include a mix of immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. azathioprine, ciclosporin, etc.). Recently international guidelines have proposed a treatment algorithm formalizing TPO-RAs and splenectomy as second and third line respectively, confirming splenectomy as second line choice only in emergency. Here we present a single center observational retrospective study of eltrombopag as second line treatment. We evaluated 48 adult primary chronic ITP patients since 2003. Forty-four out of 48 patients received a first line treatment with glucocorticoids. Twenty-two (61%) patients needed a second line treatment: 18 received eltrombopag, 3 a second course of steroid and one patient underwent splenectomy. Every patient before starting eltrombopag or receiving splenectomy underwent bone marrow examination. Overall response rate to eltrombopag was 94% with a CR rate of 76% and a PR of 23%; only one patient was non responder, underwent splenectomy and received subsequent treatment with rituximab, romiplostim and cyclosporin obtaining CR. One patient developed an autoimmune pancytopenia about a month after starting TPO-RA and in addition to eltrombopag received steroid and rituximab with blood count improvement. After a median follow up of 21,1 months (range 0,4–64,7 months) 16 patients (89%) are still on therapy maintaining response. As regards safety, gastrointestinal side effects were rare and low grade; only one patient discontinued eltrombopag after few weeks, because of dizziness. One patient had a relapse of deep venous thrombosis while no major bleeding complications were observed. Our real-life single center experience confirms efficacy and safety of eltrombopag as second line treatment in chronic ITP patients.

Abstract: Summary
Magnetic skyrmions in heavy metal (HM)/CoFeB/MgO structures are of particular interest for skyrmion-based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices because of their reliable generation, stability, and readout through purely electrical methods. To optimize the properties, such as stability, a strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is required at room temperature. Here, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that huge DMI can be obtained in Ir/CoFe structures with an Fe-terminated configuration. Moreover, Brillouin light-scattering measurements show that indeed Ta/Ir/Co20Fe60B20/MgO thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy exhibit a large DMI value (1.13 mJ/m2) when the thickness of the CoFeB layer is 1.1 nm, which can be attributed to the smooth and Fe-rich interface between Ir and CoFeB layers. Furthermore, we observe stable sub-100 nm magnetic skyrmions at room temperature in the Ir/CoFeB/MgO systems by magnetic force microscope. This work paves the way for promoting the application of skyrmions in CoFeB/MgO-based perpendicular anisotropy MTJ structures.

Abstract: Summary
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has improved dramatically from 3.8% to 25.5% in only a decade. Gas quenching is a desirable method for fabricating high-efficiency cells as it does not consume antisolvents and is compatible with large-area deposition methods such as doctor blading and slot-die coating. To further improve PCEs for gas-quenched PSCs, here, we develop complementary bulk and surface passivation strategies by incorporating potassium iodide (KI) in the perovskite precursor and applying n-hexylammonium bromide (HABr) to the perovskite surface. We show that (1) KI induces a spatial-compositional change, improving grain boundary properties; (2) KI and HABr reduce traps, especially at levels close to the mid-gap; and (3) HABr greatly improves the built-in potential of the device, thereby improving voltage output. The champion device achieves a steady-state PCE of 23.6% with a VOC of 1.23V, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest for PSC by gas quenching to date.

Abstract: Summary
A prominent technology for green hydrogen generation is the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. However, the energy efficiency of PEM electrolyzers must improve dramatically to become economically competitive. Here, we engineer the wettability of commercial porous transport layers (PTLs) to make them superhydrophilic. We find that the superhydrophilic PTLs increase the efficiency of PEM electrolyzers by >11% at high current operation (up to 20%). We show via electrochemical analyses and in operando neutron imaging that the improved efficiency stems from reduced gas saturation in the anode PTL, which significantly decreases the mass transport overpotential. We conduct ex situ microfluidic experiments and demonstrate that capillary-driven corner flow is a key physical mechanism responsible for the reduced oxygen gas saturation and enhanced liquid water transport. Our findings illustrate the importance of PTL wettability on mass transport in PEM electrolyzers and enable the design of next-generation electrolyzers with much greater efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
In battery cycling, mechanical effects introduced by electrochemical reactions are commonly observed. In return, the mechanical deformations also have a large impact on the electrochemical process. However, such a coupling effect of electrochemical reaction and mechanical deformation has a complicated interplay on the atomic scale. Herein, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy to directly visualize the coupling process of two-dimensional Van der Waals MoS2 electrodes. A self-sustained cracking mechanism is identified, and the first crack is initiated by the defects originated from the strain accumulation at the edge of intercalation front. The formed defects, including dislocations and antiphase boundaries, can accelerate the Li-ion diffusion and promote the electrochemical reaction, giving rise to the formation of a second and following cracks that resemble the “avalanche effect.” The present work provides an atomistic insight into a cooperation from the mechanical and electrochemical effects toward the formation of the arrayed cracks.

Abstract: Summary
A redox dual-flow battery is distinct from a traditional redox flow battery (RFB) in that the former includes a secondary energy platform, in which the pre-charged electrolytes can be discharged in external catalytic reactors through decoupled redox-mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The concept offers several advantages over conventional electrolysis in terms of safety, durability, modularity, and purity. In this work, we demonstrate a vanadium-manganese redox-flow battery, in which Mn3+/Mn2+ and V3+/V2+ respectively mediate the OER and the HER in Mo2C-based and RuO2-based catalysts. The flow battery demonstrates an average energy efficiency of 68% at a current density of 50 mA ⋅ cm−2 (cell voltage = 1.92 V) and a relative energy density 45% higher than the conventional all-vanadium RFB. Both electrolytes are spontaneously discharged through redox-mediated HER and OER with a faradic efficiency close to 100%.

Abstract: Summary
High-performance white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) are regarded as a promising next-generation solid-state light source. However, a low-color-rendering index (CRI), consumption of rare-earth elements, and inevitable self-absorption remain the major challenges for high-performance WLEDs. Here, lead-doped Cs3Cu2Br5 nanocrystals (NCs) with a zero-dimensional structure are prepared to facilitate stable and intrinsic white-light emission (IWE) without phosphors and other compositions. The lead dopants are expected to be centers of isolated [PbBr6] octahedrons, in which self-trapped excitons originating from distorted octahedra can form. Subsequently, a broadband blue photoluminescence (PL) from the Cs3Cu2Br5 and a broadband red PL from the lead doping are observed, exhibiting intrinsic white-light emission overall. The doped Cs3Cu2Br5 NCs are then employed to fabricate WLEDs, which possess a high CRI of 98 and an excellent 200-h operating stability.

Abstract: Summary
Binary metal oxides have received sustained interest as anode materials due to their desirable capacities, exceeding theoretical values particularly in the first discharge. Although they have received increasing attention in recent years, topical debates persist regarding not only their lithiation mechanisms but also the origin of additional capacity. Aiming to resolve these disagreements, we perform a systematic study of a series of iron and manganese oxides to investigate their phase behavior during first discharge. Using a combination of in operando pair distribution function measurements and our recently developed Metropolis non-negative matrix factorization approach to address the analytical challenges concerning materials’ nanoscopic nature and phase heterogeneity, here we report unexpected observation of non-equilibrium FeOx solid-solution phases and pulverization of MnO. These processes are correlated with the extra capacities observed at different depths of discharge, pointing to a metal-dependent nature of this additional capacity and demonstrating the advantage of our approach with promising prospects for diverse applications.

Abstract: Summary
Frost is undesirable in many applications. Previous methods of defrosting are either energy intensive or ineffective in the long term. Meanwhile, frost is a valuable freshwater source whose production is delayed due to the solid state and lengthy accumulation of frost. Here, a salt-solution-infused thin-film condenser (SSTFC) is proposed for anti-frost at low energy consumption and simultaneous freshwater production. The SSTFC is composed of a highly permeable lower layer for salt solution infusion and an ultrathin hydrophobic top layer for constraining the infused solution and incorporating condensed vapor into the underlying solution at various low temperatures. The gradually diluted salt solution can be passively transported for regeneration and freshwater production by solar energy. The regenerated salt solution can be pumped back to the SSTFC for continuous operation of the system. Energy consumption can be saved by >50% compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Introduction
There are unmet answers about the effect of the different forms of corticosteroids in the treatment of the warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA). We aimed to describe the initial response rate and the safety profile of different regimens and forms of parenteral corticosteroids versus the solo oral prednisolone as first-line strategies for newly diagnosed adult WAIHA.
Methods
We recruited 156 patients who treated with either oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily for 3 weeks or intravenous corticosteroids like dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days, Methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days, or Methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 5 days then followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. Full clinical and laboratory evaluations were done every 3 days for 3 weeks.
Results
The primary outcome was the rate of response at the end of the third-week post treatment. The rate of response was more in the group started the treatment intravenously (81.6% versus 41.7% and p = 0.0001). Multivariate cox regression analysis proved the predictivity of intravenous corticosteroid therapy for initial response.
Conclusion
The safety profile of the different forms and regimens of corticosteroids were comparable. Therefore, parenteral regimens can be used as a rescue treatment in severe cases of WAIHA.

Abstract: There are only two ways for a patient to gain access to treatment with an experimental product, such as CAR-T cells: participate in a clinical trial or receive a product in a compassionate basis. In the first case, the main beneficiary is society itself, which may in turn obtain a new treatment paradigm for a specific disease. In the second case, the use of a medicinal product has the objective of care in benefit of patients in grave clinical condition, for which no approved medicinal products exist, or for which all the possibilities for benefit from standard therapies have been exhausted. The CAR-T cell therapy may be included in one or the other types of access. The compassionate use is not a specific type of clinical research and should therefore not have its use appreciated by a research ethics committee, but rather by the medical ethics committee at the institution where the treatment will take place and by the regulatory agency.

Abstract: Summary
Ti3C2Tx MXenes have been shown to be promising candidates for use in various applications. Herein, we prepare functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets doped with cesium (Cs) and introduce them into a lead iodide (PbI2) precursor solution for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through a two-step deposition method, combining the advantages of both additives. Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveal that cesium plays an important role in improving perovskite crystallization and thus leads to enlarged crystal grains, long-lived carrier lifetimes, and reduced charge recombination compared with the devices fabricated without and with undoped Ti3C2Tx MXene. PSCs integrated with cesium-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene deliver high photovoltaic efficiency of up to 21.57% with excellent thermal stability. The incorporation of Cs-Ti3C2Tx paves the way to further improve the photovoltaic performance and thermal stability of PSCs by indirectly introducing dopants.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular switches alterable between two stable states by environmental stimuli, such as light and temperature, offer the potential for controlling biological functions. Here, we report a circular photoswitchable protein complex made of multiple protein molecules that can rapidly and reversibly switch with significant conformational changes. The structural and photochromic properties of photoactive yellow protein (PYP) are harnessed to construct circular oligomer PYPs (coPYPs) of desired sizes. Considering the light-induced N-terminal protrusion of monomer PYP, we expected coPYPs would expand upon irradiation, but time-resolved X-ray scattering data reveal that the late intermediate has a pronounced light-induced contraction motion. This work not only provides an approach to engineering a novel protein-based molecular switch based on circular oligomers of well-known protein units but also demonstrates the importance of characterizing the structural dynamics of designed molecular switches.

Abstract: Summary
Syngas (CO/H2) is an essential industrial feedstock. Electroreduction of CO2 to syngas is a desirable solution to energy and environmental challenges. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have been identified as promising electrocatalysts in CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs). Here, we report 2D PdMo curved nanosheets (PdMo CNSs) as the electrocatalyst for efficient, tunable, selective, and stable electroreduction of CO2 to syngas. The H2/CO ratio is tunable from 0.15:1 to 4:1. The current density can be as high as 65.6 mA cm–2 with a H2/CO ratio of 1:1. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that alloying Mo can optimize the electronic structure around Pd and significantly reduce the kinetic energy barrier, thus improving the migration ability of CO∗ and enhancing the anti-poisoning performance of the electrode to achieve more stable CO2 electroreduction. This work offers a strategy for developing new metal-based 2D nanomaterial electrocatalysts for efficient catalysis of CO2 to syngas.

Abstract: Summary
Silicon with a high theoretical capacity (3,579 mAh/g) is a promising anode candidate for lithium-ion batteries. However, commercialization is still impeded by low Coulombic efficiency, caused by solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and trapped lithium (Li)-silicon (Si) alloy during repeated volume change. Quantifying capacity losses from each factor is crucial to formulate rational design strategies for further improvement. In this work, titration-gas chromatography and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy are applied to characterize the evolution of trapped Li-Si alloy and SEI growth in a silicon thin-film anode. It is found that continuous growth of the SEI is the dominant factor for lithium inventory loss during cycling, with only a marginal increase in trapped Li-Si alloy. This study offers a quantitative approach to differentiate Li in the SEI from trapped Li in Li-Si alloy through a silicon thin-film anode, providing unique insights into identifying critical bottlenecks for developing Si anodes.

Abstract: Summary
Ion-conductive hydrogels combining high-performance mechanical properties, high conductivity, and self-adhesion are ideal for iontronic sensors, but their fabrication remains a challenge. Here, we present a transparent and highly ion-conductive hydrogel that integrates high strength, stretchability, and self-adhesiveness for iontronic sensors. The hydrogel is prepared by introducing biomineral calcium ions into a polyacrylamide-sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PAM–CMC) crosslinked network. The presence of Ca2+ not only induces the formation of dynamic crosslinked structure, endowing the hydrogel with notable mechanical properties (maximum strain of 1,480% and stress of 276 kPa), but also results in high ion conductivity (1.4 S·m−1). The hydrogel also exhibits strong adhesion with various substrates. Fabricated hydrogel-based sensors are highly sensitive to strain and stress changes with wide sensing ranges and can be used to detect complex human activities.

Abstract: Summary
In the past 2 decades, natural gas flaring and venting have increased due to the lack of transforming or transportation infrastructure in emerging shale-gas-producing regions. To reduce carbon emissions and wastage of shale resources, here, we report an alternative process hierarchy for natural gas liquid (NGL) to liquid fuel processes, which enables efficient valorization of shale resources on a small scale near the wellhead. While the conventional shale gas process follows a front-end separation, NGL activation, NGL upgrading hierarchy, our process introduces a hierarchy of NGL activation, NGL upgrading, back-end separation. This proposed hierarchy intensifies and simplifies the entire process by eliminating repeated or unnecessary unit operations and associated equipment. We illustrate the benefit of the proposed process hierarchy through synthesis, simulation, and analysis of an exemplary process via dehydrogenation followed by oligomerization. For small-scale plants, detailed simulation and economic analysis demonstrate this process to be economically attractive.

Abstract: Summary
Solar heat storage technology is urgently needed to harness intermittent solar energy to directly drive widespread heat-related applications. However, achieving high-efficiency solar heat storage remains elusive due to the loss of heat to the surroundings, especially through radiative processes. Here, we present a bioinspired light-adaptive shutter (LAS) with a multi-layer architecture that autonomously switches between open and closed states according to solar illumination fluctuations because of a photothermal-expansion mismatch effect. As a result, in a LAS-integrated solar heat storage system, the LAS governs the incident and dissipated radiation, suppresses the radiative heat dissipation by 20 times, and achieves high-efficiency solar heat storage with a near-zero net radiative heat dissipation. Furthermore, a LAS is demonstrated to enhance the temperature by >20°C in a 3-day field test. Given excellent responsiveness, scalable manufacturing, and feasibility under wide operating conditions, the LAS provides a promising radiation management strategy for high-efficiency solar heat storage.

Abstract: Summary
The chlorination of methane presents a route for the upgrading of natural gas to value-added products. However, due to the low reactivity of methane, existing chlorination processes require the use of elevated temperatures and catalysts. Here, we report a simple process for the chlorination of methane at near-ambient temperatures using minimal reagents and no catalysts or external sources of energy. The reaction is carried out in an aqueous medium with trichloroisocyanuric acid as a chlorinating agent. The dissolution of trichloroisocyanuric acid in water leads to the sustained and buffered release of hypochlorous acid, which triggers the chlorination of methane by a free-radical mechanism. The process is also general to other alkanes, as shown by a similar chlorination of ethane. Further developments are required for this process to be deployed as a practical method of chloromethane production.

Abstract: Summary
Highly efficient and robust non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent stability are essential for practical large-scale application of hydrogen energy. Here, we design a hybrid nanostructure of Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated uniformly within N, P co-doped carbon layers that are then integrated into conductive carbon cloth (N-Co2P/NPC). As expected, the developed electrode exhibits very low overpotentials of 68 and 230 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the electronic structure of Co2P can be tailored effectively via the N-doping effect, with the d-band center shifting to a negative position compared with that at the Fermi level, leading to optimized adsorption interaction with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates. Furthermore, a stable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 17.9% is achieved with a solar-driven water splitting electrolyzer.

Abstract: Summary
Noble metal single-atom catalysts maximize metal utilization and offer opportunities to design heterogeneous catalysts at the molecular scale. Mesoporous covalent organic frameworks provide an ideal support to stabilize metal single atoms with specific ligand configuration similar to a homogeneous catalyst. In this work, a high loading of single Pd atoms, 18.1 wt %, on mesoporous imine-linked covalent organic framework was synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for ethylene hydrogenation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of adsorbed CO demonstrate that the Pd is atomically dispersed with a highly homogeneous local coordination. The Pd single atoms are active for hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane at room temperature. The study demonstrates that mesoporous COFs provide a large number of identical metal binding sites that are good candidates for immobilizing metal single atoms and their use in gas-phase catalytic applications.

Abstract: Summary
In recent years, significant advances have been made on photoredox-catalyzed N-radical addition to C-C unsaturated bond via N-H bond cleavage. However, these N-centered radical additions have so far been mostly limited to the alkenes, and to our knowledge, N-radical 5-endo-dig cyclizations of alkynes have been less exploited. Herein, we disclose an 5-endo-dig N-radical cascade cyclization of o-ethynylacetamides by photoredox catalysis involving rare radical cleavage of C-C triple bond, allowing the practical and controllable synthesis of a diverse array of valuable benzoxazinones and 2-hydroxy-3-indolinones in moderate to good yields under mild conditions. Furthermore, a mechanistic rationale for this radical cyclization cascade is supported by various control experiments and theoretical calculations.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous studies have focused on tailoring materials for sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) in arid climates, but both the design and modification of materials are a compromise for specific conditions and even sacrifice the nature of S-shaped isotherm. Inspired by the manipulation method of air humidity, we herein propose a regulation strategy of sorbent stepwise position by inducing an inner cooling source without changing the intrinsic properties of metal-organic framework (MOF). Significant improvement of water uptake of MIL-101(Cr) coating can be reached from 0.13 to 1.05 g/g with the cooling temperature of 14°C in typical arid climate (25°C and 30% relative humidity [RH]). Mechanism of stepwise position migration is elucidated and performance of AWH device based on Peltier cooler is enhanced as compared to that without regulation. This study weakens the limitation of the exclusive tailoring materials for specific conditions and would provide a promising perspective for next-generation scalable and variable weather-adaptive AWH systems.

Abstract: Mast cells (MCs) play important roles in multiple pathologies, including fibrosis; however, their behaviors in different extracellular matrix (ECM) environments have not been fully elucidated. Accordingly, in this study, the migration of MCs on substrates with different stiffnesses was investigated using time-lapse video microscopy. Our results showed that MCs could appear in round, spindle, and star-like shapes; spindle-shaped cells accounted for 80–90 % of the total observed cells. The migration speed of round cells was significantly lower than that of cells with other shapes. Interestingly, spindle-shaped MCs migrated in a jiggling and wiggling motion between protrusions. The persistence index of MC migration was slightly higher on stiffer substrates. Moreover, we found that there was an intermediate optimal stiffness at which the migration efficiency was the highest. These findings may help to improve our understanding of MC-induced pathologies and the roles of MC migration in the immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Despite being essential interfaces between interior spaces and their surrounding environments, windows are often considered as being among the least important energy components in buildings, houses, and vehicles. The proportionally large window areas of man-made structures mean that smarter window design would lead to more efficient energy control. Here we report large-scale transparent photovoltaics and their integration with a transparent heater for an energy-efficient active window unit. The latter possesses high average visible transmittance (>60%), low transmission haze (<7%), neutral color perspective, and excellent thermal protection, and its heating function is powered by solar energy and the electric energy from the transparent photovoltaics. This active window unit may overcome some of the limitations of conventional passive windows for power consumption, with electrical power being generated from transparent solar cells and the energy flow being governed by the window’s temperature-control scheme.

Abstract: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is commonly regarded as one of the most lethal malignant tumor types with poor prognosis. Kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) is reported to be tightly related with progression of multiple cancer types which, however, has not been clarified in GBC so far. KIF15 was significantly up-regulated in clinical GBC tissues compared with that in para-carcinoma tissues and the expression level was also correlated with tumor malignancies. In addition to tissues, GBC cells also exhibited a high expression abundance of KIF15. After down-regulating KIF15 via lentiviral transfection, GBC cell proliferation and migration were both inhibited, while cell apoptosis was promoted markedly. Likewise, silencing KIF15 significantly interfered the growth of nude mouse xenografts. Our experiments in GBC cell lines also demonstrated that KIF15 overexpression accelerated cell proliferation but lessened cell apoptosis in both GBC-SD and SGC-996 cells. Further investigation of the mechanism occurring in GBC inhibition mediated by KIF15 knockdown revealed that KIF15 deficiency led to decreased activity of several signaling pathways (TNF, PI3K/AKT and MAPK), a reduction of CDK6 expression regulated by enhanced p21, and HSP60 absence. Following the treatment of shCtrl- and shKIF15-transfected cells with AKT activator, we found that anti-tumor effects resulting from KIF15 deficiency could be relieved by AKT activator in both experimental cells. Overall, for the first time, we demonstrated that KIF15 was overexpressed in GBC and displayed a close relationship between KIF15 levels and GBC clinical stages. Furthermore, low expression of KIF15 resulted in obvious anti-tumor effects.

Abstract: Advanced therapy medicinal products, considered special medications, requires Anvisa approval for use and commercialization in Brazil. They include the advanced cellular therapy products, tissue engineering products and gene therapy products, which due to their complexity involve innovation and risks, optimized regulatory channels for their development and life cycle monitoring. The scientific elements and the compliance with applicable regulatory aspects are fundamental pillars for the advancement of clinical trials, the positive evidence of the benefit-risk profile and the definition of the critical quality attributes, from the perspective of making safe, effective and high-quality products available to the population. The approval models of these products in Brazil adapt to the specificities and characteristics of the technology and the patient target population, with accelerated regulatory analyses, use in emergency situations by risk controls and specific monitoring mechanisms, principally those related to rare diseases without other therapeutic alternatives. The opportune access to the advance therapy product with safety, efficacy and quality involves innovative normative elements that include the long-term follow-up of the safety and efficacy and of the adaptive pharmacovigilance requisites, as well as the traceability mechanisms for the start-off materials, products and patients.

Abstract: Summary
Roll-to-roll (R2R) fabrication of flexible and transparent all-solid-state supercapacitors (FT-ASSCs) is extremely challenging because of the classic trade-off between transparency and capacitance. In this work, we develop fully three-dimensional (3D)-printed, sandwich-type FT-ASSCs comprised of 3D line-patterned carbon black (CB)/Ag/CB electrodes on a transparent dialysis membrane (DM) separator. By tailoring the line pitch of the 3D electrodes, our FT-ASSC is able to achieve more than 80% optical transmittance and significantly higher areal capacitance than an opaque ASSC. More importantly, the performance of 3D-printed FT-ASSCs is unrestricted by the transparency-capacitance trade-off, and they exhibit a superior capacitive figure of merit value compared with state-of-the-art FT-ASSCs reported in the literature. Additionally, our FT-ASSCs demonstrate excellent cyclic stability and mechanical robustness because of the chemical and mechanical stability of the DM separator and effective encapsulation of polyurethane. The single-flow 3D printing technique introduced here can meet the requirements for industrial-scale R2R manufacturing of energy storage devices.

Abstract: Summary
Further increase in the specific energy/energy density of lithium ion batteries can be achieved via further increase of charge cell voltage. However, an enhanced electrode cross-talk, i.e., transition metal (TM) dissolution from cathode and deposition on the anode, drastically limits the cycle life, even leading to rollover failure. In this work, the commonly used film-forming electrolyte additives vinylene carbonate (VC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), and lithium difluorophosphate (LiDFP) are thoroughly evaluated regarding their ability to suppress the issues originating from electrode cross-talk. Neither the VC- nor the FEC-containing electrolytes can suppress it, as evidenced by the presence of Ni, Co, and Mn on the graphite anode; although different for the FEC, the deposited TMs and intertwined Li deposits are homogeneously distributed in the presence of VC. Despite suppression of rollover failure in this manner, VC still cannot compete with LiDFP because LiDFP is able to complex TMs and provide TM-scavenging agents, i.e., PO3F− and PO42−, thus, effectively suppressing electrode cross-talk in the first place and effectively preventing the concomitant failure cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Although high-entropy ceramics (HECs) are greatly attractive because of their superior properties over conventional ceramics, there is a lack of reliable and effective design guidelines for producing HECs with the wished-for mechanical properties. The often-used trial-and-error testing approach or case-by-case calculations without clear design guidelines are ineffective and expensive. Here, we propose a machine-learning accelerated strategy to design HECs with the desired mechanical properties. Using rock-salt ceramics as representative examples, we demonstrate that their mechanical properties are determined synergistically by different types of bonds, and bond properties of multi-element ceramics can be weighted from those of the involved constituents. Machine-learning models are developed to describe the correlations between bond characteristics and macro-mechanical properties, which show good prediction accuracy, as verified by computational and experimental data. The strategy for the HEC design, developed based on bond-mechanical property correlations and machine-learning methodology, provides a low-cost, highly efficient, and reliable method for developing advanced ceramics with superior mechanical properties.

Abstract: Summary
The manufacturing of commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) involves a number of sophisticated production processes. Various cell defects can be induced, and, depending on their structural and chemical characteristics, they could lead to acute failure and/or chronic degradation. Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop a robust quality control (QC) procedure, the functional role of the cell defects is not well understood. Here, we address this question through a systematic experimental study of commercial 18650-type LIBs that have failed the QC inspection due to a self-discharging effect. We identify and recover the defective regions from the cell and conduct a comprehensive investigation from the chemical, structural, and morphological perspectives. Our results reveal how the structural defects affect the cell performance, which is highly important to industry-scale battery production.

Abstract: Summary
Catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes has been a prominent research theme in recent years. Here, we develop a removable bidentate picolinamide-assisted regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of homoallylic amines with organohalides and arylboronic acids. The catalytic system, using cost-effective and air-stable Ni(II) precatalyst, which could be activated by arylboronic acids, provides access to the regioselective diarylation and arylalkylation of unactivated alkenes. This reaction is compatible with α- or β-substituted terminal alkenes and internal alkenes and exhibits excellent functional group and heterocycle tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle rather than a Ni0/NiII cycle. Notably, the general and practical protocol developed herein represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of Ni-catalyzed 3-component 2,1-diarylation and arylalkylation of alkenes with arylboronic acids and organohalides.

Abstract: Summary
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is extensively employed by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-based cancer therapies, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, the dependences of PDT on light and CDT on complex chemodynamic reactions greatly limit their 1O2-generating efficiencies. Here, we exploit strain and electronic effects to fabricate a bimetallic nanocatalyst by coating a gold nanorod (AuNR) with ~2 platinum (Pt) atomic layers (AuPt0.09), which efficiently generates 1O2 from ground-state oxygen (3O2) by electron-transfer-mediated spin reduction. Density functional theory reveals strain, and electronic effects promote the adsorption of 3O2 onto AuPt0.09, which dramatically enhances 1O2 generation and imparts AuPt0.09, the highest catalytic constant ever reported for 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine oxidation to the best of our knowledge. With a pH-dependent catalytic activity, AuPt0.09 realizes acidity-dependent antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, a proof-of-concept demonstration of autocatalytic bimetallic nanocatalyst for light-free oxygen sensitization therapy, which may open a new avenue for 1O2-centered therapeutics.

Herein, inspired by the afterglow RTP of natural basswood, we prepare a series of sustainable afterglow RTP materials by confining lignin within a 3D poly(acrylic acid) network that mimics the wood matrix. The RTP emission of these materials could be finely tuned either by varying the drying temperature or the crosslinking density. Afterglow RTP emission could also be produced by embedding different types of lignin in a variety of 3D polymeric networks, thus demonstrating the generality of our strategy for preparing sustainable lignin-based RTP materials. As an illustration of potential applications, the lignin-based RTP materials are used to coat cotton fibers, which are then incorporated into luminescent textiles.

Abstract: Summary
Fluoride-ion batteries are an attractive energy storage concept analogous to lithium-ion batteries but feature an inverted paradigm where anions are the principal charge carriers. Insertion hosts that can reversibly insert fluoride ions at room temperature are exceedingly sparse. Here, we report that topochemical insertion of fluoride ions in FeSb2O4 involves Fe2+/Fe3+ redox but is mediated by multi-center synergies between iron and antimony centers. Separation of the redox center from the p-block coordination site alleviates structural strain by enabling compensatory contraction and expansion of FeO6 and SbO3 polyhedra, respectively. p-block electron lone pairs play a critical role in weakening anion-lattice interactions, enabling reversible fluoride-ion diffusion across microns. The results illuminate the key principle that interactions traceable to stereoactive lone pairs can be used to mediate anion-lattice interactions and suggest that anion insertion hosts can be designed by pairing redox-active transition metals with p-block cations bearing stereochemically active electron lone pairs.

Abstract: Summary
Owing to surface structural constraints and thermal management requirements, visible-infrared-compatible camouflage for a high-temperature target remains challenging. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional periodic aperture array into a ZnO/Ag/ZnO film to create a visible-infrared-compatible camouflage photonic crystal with thermal management capacity by using the optical transmission in a dielectric/metal/dielectric (D/M/D) structure. Because of the high visible transmittance of the D/M/D structure, when applied to a visible camouflage coating, the lower coating can be displayed, realizing visible camouflage. Due to the perforated Ag layer, both low emittances in 3–5 and 8–14 μm for infrared camouflage and high transmission in 5–8 μm for heat dissipation by radiation are achieved. The experiments demonstrate that this photonic crystal exhibits high-temperature infrared camouflage in both atmospheric windows and it is much cooler than an Al film subjected to the same heating power.

Abstract: Summary
Hybrid perovskites currently exhibit higher efficiencies than their all-inorganic counterparts in photovoltaic applications, which has led to a common belief that the organic cation somehow suppresses defect-assisted nonradiative recombination. Using first-principles calculations, here we show that the dominant nonradiative recombination center in CsPbI3 is the iodine interstitial, which causes similar nonradiative capture rates as in MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3). However, the MA cation can give rise to additional strong nonradiative recombination centers such as hydrogen vacancies, which are absent from CsPbI3. One major advantage of MA+ over Cs+ is a better stability of the perovskite phase. Our study suggests that all-inorganic halide perovskites, if they can be stabilized, hold great promise for high-efficiency optoelectronic applications. These critical insights may prevent all-inorganic halide perovskites from being disregarded as potentially strong candidates for solar cell materials.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins mediates the assembly of biomolecular condensates involved in physiological and pathological processes. Identifying the minimalistic building blocks and the sequence determinant of protein phase separation is an urgent need but remains challenging partially due to lack of methodologies to characterize the phase behavior. Here, we demonstrate computational tools to efficiently quantify the microscopic fluidity of liquid condensates and the temperature-dependent phase diagram of peptides. We comprehensively explore the LLPS abilities of all 400 dipeptide combinations of coded amino acids and observe the occurrences of spontaneous LLPS in three categories of dipeptides. Our predictions are validated by turbidity assays and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. We demonstrate that dipeptides, minimal but complete, possess multivalent interactions sufficient for LLPS, suggesting LLPS is a general property of peptides and proteins, independent of their sequence length. This study paves the way for the prediction and characterization of peptide phase behavior at the molecular level.

Abstract: Summary
The development of high-performance cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is one key issue required for the success of large-scale energy storage systems. In addition to performance degradation during cycling, electrode materials are usually hampered by instability when stored in various environments severely restricting their practical application. Here, we report a stable cathode material that shows no obvious capacity attenuation in various storage conditions. The cathode is composed of regular and homogeneous Na3V2(PO4)2O2F0.99Cl0.01 (NVPFCl) microcubes, with electrochemical properties, including high specific capacity (128.2 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C), excellent rate capability (79.8 mA h g-1 at 20 C), long-term cycle life, and all-climate performance. Studies using in/ex situ characterization and electrode kinetics are implemented to reveal the possible reasons for the stability and electrochemical activity of NVPFCl. This work may provide a pathway for the development of all-climate and storage-stable SIB cathode materials.

Abstract: Summary
High-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) are an area of interest due to their interesting structural features, large compositional space, and high potential for catalytic applications. While many HEA NPs have been successfully synthesized and characterized, little is known about the impact of composition on structural features. This work utilizes element-specific X-ray spectroscopy techniques to compare 5- and 15-element HEA NPs with shared elements, aiming to understand the impact that adding additional elements to an HEA has on its structure and properties. Here, we report significant differences between HEA-5 and HEA-15. In particular, the 3d elements show different oxidation behavior associated with different bonding properties. Varied bonding properties are also observed in the 4d and 5d elements. These results provide an understanding of the impact composition plays on the HEA structure, which will serve to aid in the fine-tuning of structure and properties of HEAs through adjusting their composition.

Abstract: Summary
Developing materials resistant to high-rate impacts requires an understanding of the molecular mechanism at play during the spatiotemporal scales of these events. Controlling the response of thin films under impact by manipulating their molecular structure is a key challenge for materials science applications and fundamental understanding of the material behavior under high-rate deformations. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics, we tune the mobility and mechanical properties of star polymer films by varying the number of arms of the star (2≤f≤16) and their length (10≤M≤50). We subject the films to nanoballistic impacts and identify two components of the penetration energy Ep,1∗ and Ep,2∗, corresponding to the early-stage compression and late-stage deformation of the film. Ep,1∗ correlates with Young’s modulus and the Debye-Waller factor of the films, and Ep,2∗ correlates with the toughness of the films. These correlations between dynamics, mechanical properties, and ballistic resistance provide important guidelines to develop new polymer-based, impact-resistant nanomaterials.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple studies have recently been conducted to develop well-ordered covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs). To date, few studies have demonstrated CTFs with high crystallinity using novel synthesis strategies and different building blocks. To construct highly crystalline CTFs with enhanced performance, significant technical advancements in fundamental chemical insights are essential. Here, we report that the phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5)-catalyzed condensation of biphenyl-based amide and nitrile monomers can produce ordered pCTF-2. The pCTF-2A directly synthesized from amide monomers showed unusually higher crystallinity and porosity than the pCTF-2N synthesized from nitrile monomers. Based on experimental results, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that amide groups can be directly trimerized into triazine rings in the presence of P2O5, which is a more thermodynamically favorable reaction than those from nitrile groups. Based on this mechanistic insight, the efficient and better synthesis strategy provides an effective pathway for the formation of crystalline CTFs.
