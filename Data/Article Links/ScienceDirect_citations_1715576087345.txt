Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-18 (IL-18) promotes natural killer (NK) and T cell production of interferon (IFN)-γ, a key factor in resistance to Toxoplasma gondii, but previous work has shown a limited role for endogenous IL-18 in control of this parasite. Although infection with T. gondii results in release of IL-18, the production of IFN-γ induces high levels of the IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). Antagonism of IL-18BP with a “decoy-to-the-decoy” (D2D) IL-18 construct that does not signal but rather binds IL-18BP results in enhanced innate lymphoid cell (ILC) and T cell responses and improved parasite control. In addition, the use of IL-18 resistant to IL-18BP (“decoy-resistant” IL-18 [DR-18]) is more effective than exogenous IL-18 at promoting innate resistance to infection. DR-18 enhances CD4+ T cell production of IFN-γ but results in CD4+ T cell-mediated pathology. Thus, endogenous IL-18BP restrains aberrant immune pathology, and this study highlights strategies that can be used to tune this regulatory pathway for optimal anti-pathogen responses.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern (VoC) and its sublineages contain 31–36 mutations in spike and escape neutralization by most therapeutic antibodies. In a pseudovirus neutralization assay, 66 of the nearly 400 candidate therapeutics in the Coronavirus Immunotherapeutic Consortium (CoVIC) panel neutralize Omicron and multiple Omicron sublineages. Among natural immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs), especially those in the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-2 epitope community, nearly all Omicron neutralizers recognize spike bivalently, with both antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) simultaneously engaging adjacent RBDs on the same spike. Most IgGs that do not neutralize Omicron bind either entirely monovalently or have some (22%–50%) monovalent occupancy. Cleavage of bivalent-binding IgGs to Fabs abolishes neutralization and binding affinity, with disproportionate loss of activity against Omicron pseudovirus and spike. These results suggest that VoC-resistant antibodies overcome mutagenic substitution via avidity. Hence, vaccine strategies targeting future SARS-CoV-2 variants should consider epitope display with spacing and organization identical to trimeric spike.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid release of neurotransmitters in synchrony with action potentials is considered a key hardwired property of synapses. Here, in glutamatergic synapses formed between induced human neurons, we show that action potential-dependent neurotransmitter release becomes progressively desynchronized as synapses mature and age. In this solely excitatory network, the emergence of NMDAR-mediated transmission elicits endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to downregulation of key presynaptic molecules, synaptotagmin-1 and cysteine string protein α, that synchronize neurotransmitter release. The emergence of asynchronous release with neuronal maturity and subsequent aging is maintained by the high-affinity Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-7 and suppressed by the introduction of GABAergic transmission into the network, inhibition of NMDARs, and ER stress. These results suggest that long-term disruption of excitation-inhibition balance affects the synchrony of excitatory neurotransmission in human synapses.

Abstract: Summary
Despite extensive investigations in mammals and yeasts, the importance and specificity of COMPASS-like complex, which catalyzes histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me), are not fully understood in plants. Here, we report that JMJ28, a Jumonji C domain-containing protein in Arabidopsis, recognizes specific DNA motifs through a plant-specific WRC domain and acts as an interacting factor to guide the chromatin targeting of ATX1/2-containing COMPASS-like complex. JMJ28 associates with COMPASS-like complex in vivo via direct interaction with RBL. The DNA-binding activity of JMJ28 is essential for both the targeting specificity of ATX1/2-COMPASS and the deposition of H3K4me at specific loci but exhibit functional redundancy with alternative COMPASS-like complexes at other loci. Finally, we demonstrate that JMJ28 is a negative regulator of plant immunity. In summary, our findings reveal a plant-specific recruitment mechanism of COMPASS-like complex. These findings help to gain deeper insights into the regulatory mechanism of COMPASS-like complex in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Choline supplies methyl groups for regeneration of methionine and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine in the liver. Here, we report that the catabolism of membrane phosphatidylcholine (PC) into water-soluble glycerophosphocholine (GPC) by the phospholipase/lysophospholipase PNPLA8-PNPLA7 axis enables endogenous choline stored in hepatic PC to be utilized in methyl metabolism. PNPLA7-deficient mice show marked decreases in hepatic GPC, choline, and several metabolites related to the methionine cycle, accompanied by various signs of methionine insufficiency, including growth retardation, hypoglycemia, hypolipidemia, increased energy consumption, reduced adiposity, increased fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and an altered histone/DNA methylation landscape. Moreover, PNPLA8-deficient mice recapitulate most of these phenotypes. In contrast to wild-type mice fed a methionine/choline-deficient diet, both knockout strains display decreased hepatic triglyceride, likely via reductions of lipogenesis and GPC-derived glycerol flux. Collectively, our findings highlight the biological importance of phospholipid catabolism driven by PNPLA8/PNPLA7 in methyl group flux and triglyceride synthesis in the liver.

Abstract: Summary
The conserved regulon of heat shock factor 1 in budding yeast contains chaperones for general protein folding as well as zinc-finger protein Zpr1, whose essential role in archaea and eukaryotes remains unknown. Here, we show that Zpr1 depletion causes acute proteotoxicity driven by biosynthesis of misfolded eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). Prolonged Zpr1 depletion leads to eEF1A insufficiency, thereby inducing the integrated stress response and inhibiting protein synthesis. Strikingly, we show by using two distinct biochemical reconstitution approaches that Zpr1 enables eEF1A to achieve a conformational state resistant to protease digestion. Lastly, we use a ColabFold model of the Zpr1-eEF1A complex to reveal a folding mechanism mediated by the Zpr1’s zinc-finger and alpha-helical hairpin structures. Our work uncovers the long-sought-after function of Zpr1 as a bespoke chaperone tailored to the biogenesis of one of the most abundant proteins in the cell.

Abstract: Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell proliferation arrest accompanied by a distinct secretory program impacting the senescent cell microenvironment. This phenotype can be induced by many stresses, including telomere shortening, oncogene activation, oxidative or genotoxic stress. Cellular senescence plays a key role in the organism throughout life, with beneficial effects at a young age for instance in embryonic development and wound healing, and deleterious effects during aging and in aging-related diseases. In the last decade calcium and calcium signaling have been established as critical factors in the implementation and regulation of cellular senescence. In this review we will present and discuss the main discoveries in this field, from the observation of an increased intracellular calcium concentration in senescent cells to the identification of calcium-binding proteins, calcium channels (TRP, ITPR, …) and MERCs (mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites) as key players in this context.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays crucial roles in regulating RNA metabolisms. METTL16 identified as a single-component methyltransferase catalyzes m6A formation in the nucleus; whether it regulates cytoplasmic RNA fate remains unknown. Here, we detected the dual localization of METTL16 in the nucleus and cytoplasm. METTL16 depletion attenuates protein synthesis, but the methyltransferase activity is not required for its translation-promoting function. Mechanistically, we identified an interactor of METTL16, eIF4E2, which represses translation by acting as a competitor of eIF4E. The METTL16-eIF4E2 interaction impedes the recruitment of eIF4E2 to 5′ cap structure, promoting the cap recognition by eIF4E and selective protein synthesis. Depletion of METTL16 suppresses lung tumorigenesis by downregulating the translation of key oncogenes. Collectively, our study reports a role of METTL16 in modulating translation and provides a therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in motivation and reward processing. Recent studies suggest that different NAc subnuclei differentially contribute to reward-related behaviors. However, how reward is encoded in individual NAc neurons remains unclear. Using in vivo single-cell resolution calcium imaging, we find diverse patterns of reward encoding in the medial and lateral shell subdivision of the NAc (NAcMed and NAcLat, respectively). Reward consumption increases NAcLat activity but decreases NAcMed activity, albeit with high variability among neurons. The heterogeneity in reward encoding could be attributed to differences in their synaptic inputs and transcriptional profiles. Specific optogenetic activation of Nts-positive neurons in the NAcLat promotes positive reinforcement, while activation of Cartpt-positive neurons in the NAcMed induces behavior aversion. Collectively, our study shows the organizational and transcriptional differences in NAc subregions and provides a framework for future dissection of NAc subregions in physiological and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The advance and stability of replication forks rely on a tight co-regulation of DNA synthesis and nucleosome assembly. We show that mutants affected in parental histone recycling are impaired in the recombinational repair of the single-stranded DNA gaps generated in response to DNA adducts that hamper replication, which are then filled in by translesion synthesis. These recombination defects are in part due to an excess of parental nucleosomes at the invaded strand that destabilizes the sister chromatid junction formed after strand invasion through a Srs2-dependent mechanism. In addition, we show that a dCas9∗/R-loop is more recombinogenic when the dCas9∗/DNA-RNA hybrid interferes with the lagging than with the leading strand, and this recombination is particularly sensitive to problems in the deposition of parental histones at the strand that contains the hindrance. Therefore, parental histone distribution and location of the replication obstacle at the lagging or leading strand regulate homologous recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are critical in the host defense against Staphylococcus aureus, a major human pathogen. However, even in the setting of a robust neutrophil response, S. aureus can evade immune clearance. Here, we demonstrate that S. aureus impairs neutrophil function by triggering the production of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate. The enzyme that synthesizes itaconate, Irg1, is selectively expressed in neutrophils during S. aureus pneumonia. Itaconate inhibits neutrophil glycolysis and oxidative burst, which impairs survival and bacterial killing. In a murine pneumonia model, neutrophil Irg1 expression protects the lung from excessive inflammation but compromises bacterial clearance. S. aureus is thus able to evade the innate immune response by targeting neutrophil metabolism and inducing the production of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate.

Abstract: Summary
Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is a heterotetrameric enzyme complex belonging to the mitochondrial respiratory chain and uniquely links the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer-related SDH mutations promote succinate accumulation, which is regarded as an oncometabolite. Post-translational modifications of SDH complex components are known to regulate SDH activity, although the contribution of SUMOylation remains unclear. Here, we show that SDHA is SUMOylated by PIAS3 and deSUMOylated by SENP2, events dictating the assembly and activity of the SDH complex. Moreover, CBP acetylation of SENP2 negatively regulates its deSUMOylation activity. Under glutamine deprivation, CBP levels decrease, and the ensuing SENP2 activation and SDHA deSUMOylation serve to concurrently dampen the TCA cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) activity. Along with succinate accumulation, this mechanism avoids excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to promote cancer cell survival. This study elucidates a major function of mitochondrial-localized SENP2 and expands our understanding of the role of SUMOylation in resolving metabolic stress.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 encounters the hierarchically organized host chromatin to stably integrate and persist in anatomically distinct latent reservoirs. The contribution of genome organization in HIV-1 infection has been largely understudied across different HIV-1 targets. Here, we determine HIV-1 integration sites (ISs), associate them with chromatin and expression signatures at different genomic scales in a microglia cell model, and profile them together with the primary T cell reservoir. HIV-1 insertions into introns of actively transcribed genes with IS hotspots in genic and super-enhancers, characteristic of blood cells, are maintained in the microglia cell model. Genome organization analysis reveals dynamic CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) clusters in cells with active and repressed HIV-1 transcription, whereas CTCF removal impairs viral integration. We identify CTCF-enriched topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries with signatures of transcriptionally active chromatin as HIV-1 integration determinants in microglia and CD4+ T cells, highlighting the importance of host genome organization in HIV-1 infection.

Abstract: Summary
In response to lysosomal damage, cells engage several quality-control mechanisms, including the selective isolation and degradation of damaged lysosomes by lysophagy. Here, we report that the selective autophagy adaptor SQSTM1/p62 is recruited to damaged lysosomes in both HeLa cells and neurons and is required for lysophagic flux. The Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain of p62 mediates oligomerization and is specifically required for lysophagy. Consistent with this observation, we find that p62 forms condensates on damaged lysosomes. These condensates are precisely tuned by the small heat shock protein HSP27, which is phosphorylated in response to lysosomal injury and maintains the liquidity of p62 condensates, facilitating autophagosome formation. Mutations in p62 have been identified in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); ALS-associated mutations in p62 impair lysophagy, suggesting that deficits in this pathway may contribute to neurodegeneration. Thus, p62 condensates regulated by HSP27 promote lysophagy by forming platforms for autophagosome biogenesis at damaged lysosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Tetraspanins, a superfamily of membrane proteins, mediate diverse biological processes through tetraspanin-enriched microdomains in the plasma membrane. However, how their cell-surface presentation is controlled remains unclear. To identify the regulators of tetraspanin trafficking, we conduct sequential genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 screens based on cell-surface expression of a tetraspanin member, TSPAN8. Several genes potentially involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting, different biological processes in the Golgi apparatus, and protein trafficking are identified and functionally validated. Importantly, we find that biantennary N-glycans generated by MGAT1/2, but not more complex glycan structures, are important for cell-surface tetraspanin expression. Moreover, we unravel that SPPL3, a Golgi intramembrane-cleaving protease reported previously to act as a sheddase of multiple glycan-modifying enzymes, controls cell-surface tetraspanin expression through a mechanism associated with lacto-series glycolipid biosynthesis. Our study provides critical insights into the molecular regulation of cell-surface presentation of tetraspanins with implications for strategies to manipulate their functions, including cancer cell invasion.

Abstract: Summary
The biology of Korarchaeia remains elusive due to the lack of genome representatives. Here, we reconstruct 10 closely related metagenome-assembled genomes from hot spring habitats and place them into a single species, proposed herein as Panguiarchaeum symbiosum. Functional investigation suggests that Panguiarchaeum symbiosum is strictly anaerobic and grows exclusively in thermal habitats by fermenting peptides coupled with sulfide and hydrogen production to dispose of electrons. Due to its inability to biosynthesize archaeal membranes, amino acids, and purines, this species likely exists in a symbiotic lifestyle similar to DPANN archaea. Population metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analyses demonstrated that genes associated with amino acid/peptide uptake and cell attachment exhibited positive selection and were highly expressed, supporting the proposed proteolytic catabolism and symbiotic lifestyle. Our study sheds light on the metabolism, evolution, and potential symbiotic lifestyle of Panguiarchaeum symbiosum, which may be a unique host-dependent archaeon within the TACK superphylum.

Abstract: Summary
The general understanding of hippocampal circuits is that the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC) are topographically connected through parallel identical circuits along the dorsoventral axis. Our anterograde tracing and in vitro electrophysiology data, however, show a markedly different dorsoventral organization of the hippocampal projection to the medial EC (MEC). While dorsal hippocampal projections are confined to the dorsal MEC, ventral hippocampal projections innervate both dorsal and ventral MEC. Further, whereas the dorsal hippocampus preferentially targets layer Vb (LVb) neurons, the ventral hippocampus mainly targets cells in layer Va (LVa). This connectivity scheme differs from hippocampal projections to the lateral EC, which are topographically organized along the dorsoventral axis. As LVa neurons project to telencephalic structures, our findings indicate that the ventral hippocampus regulates LVa-mediated entorhinal-neocortical output from both dorsal and ventral MEC. Overall, the marked dorsoventral differences in hippocampal-entorhinal connectivity impose important constraints on signal flow in hippocampal-neocortical circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Transposons are mobile elements that are commonly silenced to protect eukaryotic genome integrity. In plants, transposable element (TE)-derived inverted repeats (IRs) are commonly found near genes, where they affect host gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms of such regulation are unclear in most cases. Expression of these IRs is associated with production of 24-nt small RNAs, methylation of the IRs, and drastic changes in local 3D chromatin organization. Notably, many of these IRs differ between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, causing variation in short-range chromatin interactions and gene expression. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of two IRs leads to a switch in genome topology and gene expression with phenotypic consequences. Our data show that insertion of an IR near a gene provides an anchor point for chromatin interactions that profoundly impact the activity of neighboring loci. This turns IRs into powerful evolutionary agents that can contribute to rapid adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is a considerable health concern with limited pharmacotherapy options of low efficacy. Here, we develop a GLP-1/GDF15 fusion protein and explore its weight-lowering potential in animals. The molecule, QL1005, is engineered via fusing GLP-1 and GDF15 analogs by a peptide linker and conjugating it to a fatty acid for time-action extension. In vitro, the potency of QL1005 is superior to the GLP-1 analog semaglutide. In obese mice, QL1005 induces reductions in body weight, food intake, insulin, fasting glucose, and triglycerides. Notably, these metabolic effects come as a result of activities emanating from both GLP-1 and GDF15, in an individual pathway-balanced fashion. In a cynomolgus monkey model of obesity, QL1005 reduces body weight, food intake, insulin, and glucose in a dose-dependent manner with limited incidence of GI side effects. Altogether, this long-acting, dual GLP-1/GDF15 molecule demonstrates the promise of poly-pharmaceutical approaches in metabolic drug discovery and development.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder causing progressive loss of motor neurons. Mutations in Fused in sarcoma (FUS) leading to its cytoplasmic mislocalization cause a subset of ALS. Under stress, mutant FUS localizes to stress granules (SGs)—cytoplasmic condensates composed of RNA and various proteins. Aberrant dynamics of SGs is linked to the pathology of ALS. Here, using motor neurons (MNs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, we show that, in mutant FUS, MN dynamics of SGs is disturbed. Additionally, heat-shock response (HSR) and integrated stress response (ISR) involved in the regulation of SGs are upregulated in mutant MNs. HSR activation correlates with the amount of cytoplasmic FUS mislocalization. While inhibition of SG formation, translation, or ISR does not influence survival of FUS ALS neurons, proteotoxicity that cannot be compensated with the activation of stress pathways is the main driver of neurodegeneration in early FUS ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Nitric oxide (NO) production in the tumor microenvironment is a common element in cancer. S-nitrosylation, the post-translational modification of cysteines by NO, is emerging as a key transduction mechanism sustaining tumorigenesis. However, most oncoproteins that are regulated by S-nitrosylation are still unknown. Here we show that S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), the enzyme that deactivates S-nitrosylation, is hypo-expressed in several human malignancies. Using multiple tumor models, we demonstrate that GSNOR deficiency induces S-nitrosylation of focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1) at C658. This event enhances FAK1 autophosphorylation and sustains tumorigenicity by providing cancer cells with the ability to survive in suspension (evade anoikis). In line with these results, GSNOR-deficient tumor models are highly susceptible to treatment with FAK1 inhibitors. Altogether, our findings advance our understanding of the oncogenic role of S-nitrosylation, define GSNOR as a tumor suppressor, and point to GSNOR hypo-expression as a therapeutically exploitable vulnerability in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Biological systems can maintain memories over long timescales, with examples including memories in the brain and immune system. It is unknown how functional properties of memory systems, such as memory persistence, can be established by biological circuits. To address this question, we focus on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in Caenorhabditis elegans. In response to a trigger, worms silence a target gene for multiple generations, resisting strong dilution due to growth and reproduction. Silencing may also be maintained indefinitely upon selection according to silencing levels. We show that these properties imply the fine-tuning of biochemical rates in which the silencing system is positioned near the transition to bistability. We demonstrate that this behavior is consistent with a generic mechanism based on competition for synthesis resources, which leads to self-organization around a critical state with broad silencing timescales. The theory makes distinct predictions and offers insights into the design principles of long-term memory systems.

Abstract: Summary
The fungal cell wall provides protection and structure and is an important target for antifungal compounds. A mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade termed the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway regulates transcriptional responses to cell wall damage. Here, we describe a posttranscriptional pathway that plays an important complementary role. We report that the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) Mrn1 and Nab6 specifically target the 3′ UTRs of a largely overlapping set of cell wall-related mRNAs. These mRNAs are downregulated in the absence of Nab6, indicating a function in target mRNA stabilization. Nab6 acts in parallel to CWI signaling to maintain appropriate expression of cell wall genes during stress. Cells lacking both pathways are hypersensitive to antifungal compounds targeting the cell wall. Deletion of MRN1 partially alleviates growth defects associated with Δnab6, and Mrn1 has an opposing function in mRNA destabilization. Our results uncover a posttranscriptional pathway that mediates cellular resistance to antifungal compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Tight glycemic control (TGC), the cornerstone of diabetic management, reduces the incidence and progression of diabetic microvascular disease. However, TGC can also lead to transient episodes of hypoglycemia, which have been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that low glucose levels result in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1-dependent expression of the glucose transporter, Glut1, in retinal cells. Enhanced nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α was independent of its canonical post-translational stabilization but instead dependent on stimulation of its translation and nuclear localization. In the presence of hypoxia, this physiologic response to low glucose resulted in a marked increase in the secretion of the HIF-dependent vasoactive mediators that promote diabetic retinopathy. Our results provide a molecular explanation for how early glucose control, as well as glycemic variability (i.e., oscillating serum glucose levels), contributes to diabetic eye disease. These observations have important implications for optimizing glucose management in patients with diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Translocon clogging at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a result of translation stalling triggers ribosome UFMylation, activating translocation-associated quality control (TAQC) to degrade clogged substrates. How cells sense ribosome UFMylation to initiate TAQC is unclear. We conduct a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify an uncharacterized membrane protein named SAYSD1 that facilitates TAQC. SAYSD1 associates with the Sec61 translocon and also recognizes both ribosome and UFM1 directly, engaging a stalled nascent chain to ensure its transport via the TRAPP complex to lysosomes for degradation. Like UFM1 deficiency, SAYSD1 depletion causes the accumulation of translocation-stalled proteins at the ER and triggers ER stress. Importantly, disrupting UFM1- and SAYSD1-dependent TAQC in Drosophila leads to intracellular accumulation of translocation-stalled collagens, defective collagen deposition, abnormal basement membranes, and reduced stress tolerance. Thus, SAYSD1 acts as a UFM1 sensor that collaborates with ribosome UFMylation at the site of clogged translocon, safeguarding ER homeostasis during animal development.

Abstract: Summary
Variations in the composition of the intestinal bacterial microbiome correlate with acquisition of some sexually transmitted pathogens. To experimentally assess the contribution of intestinal dysbiosis to rectal lentiviral acquisition, we induce dysbiosis in rhesus macaques (RMs) with the antibiotic vancomycin prior to repeated low-dose intrarectal challenge with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVmac239X. Vancomycin administration reduces T helper 17 (TH17) and TH22 frequencies, increases expression of host bacterial sensors and antibacterial peptides, and increases numbers of transmitted-founder (T/F) variants detected upon SIV acquisition. We observe that SIV acquisition does not correlate with measures of dysbiosis but rather associates with perturbations in the host antimicrobial program. These findings establish a functional association between the intestinal microbiome and susceptibility to lentiviral acquisition across the rectal epithelial barrier.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe and deadly manifestation of tuberculosis. Neurological complications are observed in up to 50% of patients affected. Here, attenuated Mycobacterium bovis are injected into the cerebellum of mice, and histopathological images and cultured colonies confirm successful brain infection. Then, whole-brain tissue is dissected for 10X Genomics single-cell sequencing, and we acquire 15 cell types. Transcriptional changes of inflammation processes are found in multiple cell types. Specifically, Stat1 and IRF1 are shown to mediate inflammation in macrophages and microglia. For neurons, decreased oxidative phosphorylation activity in neurons is observed, which corresponds to TBM clinical symptoms of neurodegeneration. Finally, ependymal cells present prominent transcriptional changes, and decreased FERM domain containing 4A (Frmd4a) may contribute to TBM clinical symptoms of hydrocephalus and neurodegeneration. This study shows a single-cell transcriptome of M. bovis infection in mice and improves the understanding of brain infection and neurological complications in TBM.

Abstract: Summary
Insights into the evolution of non-model organisms are limited by the lack of reference genomes of high accuracy, completeness, and contiguity. Here, we present a chromosome-level, karyotype-validated reference genome and pangenome for the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). We complement these resources with a reference-free multialignment of the reference genome with other bird genomes and with the most comprehensive catalog of genetic markers for the barn swallow. We identify potentially conserved and accelerated genes using the multialignment and estimate genome-wide linkage disequilibrium using the catalog. We use the pangenome to infer core and accessory genes and to detect variants using it as a reference. Overall, these resources will foster population genomics studies in the barn swallow, enable detection of candidate genes in comparative genomics studies, and help reduce bias toward a single reference genome.

Abstract: Summary
How do patterns of neural activity in the motor cortex contribute to the planning of a movement? A recent theory developed for single movements proposes that the motor cortex acts as a dynamical system whose initial state is optimized during the preparatory phase of the movement. This theory makes important yet untested predictions about preparatory dynamics in more complex behavioral settings. Here, we analyze preparatory activity in non-human primates planning not one but two movements simultaneously. As predicted by the theory, we find that parallel planning is achieved by adjusting preparatory activity within an optimal subspace to an intermediate state reflecting a trade-off between the two movements. The theory quantitatively accounts for the relationship between this intermediate state and fluctuations in the animals’ behavior down at the trial level. These results uncover a simple mechanism for planning multiple movements in parallel and further point to motor planning as a controlled dynamical process.

Abstract: Aims
Brain ischemia and reperfusion may occur in several clinical conditions that have high rates of mortality and disability, compromising an individual’s quality of life. Brain injury can affect organs beyond the brain, such as the gastrointestinal tract. The present study investigated the effects of cerebral ischemia on the ileum and jejunum during a chronic reperfusion period by examining oxidative stress, inflammatory parameters, and the myenteric plexus in Wistar rats.
Main methods
Ischemia was induced by the four-vessel occlusion model for 15 min with 52 days of reperfusion. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were evaluated using biochemical techniques. Gastrointestinal transit time was evaluated, and immunofluorescence techniques were used to examine morpho-quantitative aspects of myenteric neurons.
Key findings
Brain ischemia and reperfusion promoted inflammation, characterized by increases in myeloperoxidase and N-acetylglycosaminidase activity, oxidative stress, and lipid hydroperoxides, decreases in superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, a decrease in levels of reduced glutathione, neurodegeneration in the gut, and slow gastrointestinal transit.
Significance
Chronic ischemia and reperfusion promoted a slow gastrointestinal transit time, oxidative stress, and inflammation and neurodegeneration in the small intestine in rats. These findings indicate that the use of antioxidant and antiinflammatory molecules even after a long period of reperfusion may be useful to alleviate the consequences of this pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Commonly used antihistamines and other cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) are emerging as putative cancer drugs. Their unique chemical structure enables CADs to accumulate rapidly inside lysosomes, where they increase lysosomal pH, alter lysosomal lipid metabolism, and eventually cause lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Here, we show that CAD-induced rapid elevation in lysosomal pH is caused by a lysosomal H+ efflux that requires P2RX4-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ release and precedes the lysosomal membrane permeabilization. The subsequent cytosolic acidification triggers the dephosphorylation, lysosomal translocation, and inactivation of the oncogenic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor. Moreover, CAD-induced lysosomal H+ efflux sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis induced by STAT3 inhibition and acts synergistically with STAT3 inhibition in restricting the tumor growth of A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma xenografts. These findings identify lysosomal H+ efflux and STAT3 inhibition as anticancer mechanisms of CADs and reinforce the repurposing of safe and inexpensive CADs as cancer drugs with a drug combination strategy.

Abstract: Summary
The skin transmits affective signals that integrate into our social vocabulary. As the socio-affective aspects of touch are likely processed in the amygdala, we compare neural responses to social grooming and gentle airflow recorded from the amygdala and the primary somatosensory cortex of non-human primates. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex respond to both types of tactile stimuli. In the amygdala, however, neurons do not respond to individual grooming sweeps even though grooming elicits autonomic states indicative of positive affect. Instead, many show changes in baseline firing rates that persist throughout the grooming bout. Such baseline fluctuations are attributed to social context because the presence of the groomer alone can account for the observed changes in baseline activity. It appears, therefore, that during grooming, the amygdala stops responding to external inputs on a short timescale but remains responsive to social context (or the associated affective states) on longer time scales.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapy critically depends on fitness of cytotoxic and helper T cell responses. Dysfunctional cytotoxic T cell states in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are a major cause of resistance to immunotherapy. Intratumoral myeloid cells, particularly blood-borne myeloids (bbm), are key drivers of T cell dysfunction in the TME. We show here that major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-restricted antigen presentation on bbm is essential to control the growth of brain tumors. Loss of MHCII on bbm drives dysfunctional intratumoral tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell states through increased chromatin accessibility and expression of Tox, a critical regulator of T cell exhaustion. Mechanistically, MHCII-dependent activation of CD4+ T cells restricts myeloid-derived osteopontin that triggers a chronic activation of NFAT2 in tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells. In summary, we provide evidence that MHCII-restricted antigen presentation on bbm is a key mechanism to directly maintain functional cytotoxic T cell states in brain tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Replication protein A (RPA) is a major regulator of eukaryotic DNA metabolism involved in multiple essential cellular processes. Maintaining appropriate RPA dynamics is crucial for cells to prevent RPA exhaustion, which can lead to replication fork breakage and replication catastrophe. However, how cells regulate RPA availability during unperturbed replication and in response to stress has not been well elucidated. Here, we show that HNRNPA2B1SUMO functions as an endogenous inhibitor of RPA during normal replication. HNRNPA2B1SUMO associates with RPA through recognizing the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of RPA to inhibit RPA accumulation at replication forks and impede local ATR activation. Declining HNRNPA2SUMO induced by DNA damage will release nuclear soluble RPA to localize to chromatin and enable ATR activation. Furthermore, we characterize that HNRNPA2B1 hinders homologous recombination (HR) repair via limiting RPA availability, thus conferring sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. These findings establish HNRNPA2B1 as a critical player in RPA-dependent surveillance networks.

Abstract: Summary
The AAA+ ATPase Cdc48 utilizes the cofactor Ufd1/Npl4 to bind and thread polyubiquitinated substrates for their extraction from complexes or membranes and often for subsequent proteasomal degradation. Previous studies indicated that Cdc48 engages polyubiquitin chains through the Npl4-mediated unfolding of an initiator ubiquitin; yet, the underlying principles remain largely unknown. Using FRET-based assays, we revealed the mechanisms and kinetics of ubiquitin unfolding, insertion into the ATPase, and unfolding of the ubiquitin-attached substrate. We found that Cdc48 uses Ufd1’s UT3 domain to bind a K48-linked ubiquitin on the initiator’s proximal side of the chain, thereby directing the initiator toward rapid unfolding by Npl4 and engagement by Cdc48. Ubiquitins on the initiator’s distal side increase substrate affinity and facilitate unfolding but impede substrate release from Cdc48-Ufd1/Npl4 in the absence of additional cofactors. Our findings explain how Cdc48-UN efficiently processes substrates with K48-linked chains of 4–6 ubiquitins, which represent most cellular polyubiquitinated proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The vertebrate inner retina is driven by photoreceptors whose outputs are already pre-processed; in zebrafish, outer retinal circuits split “color” from “grayscale” information across four cone-photoreceptor types. It remains unclear how the inner retina processes incoming spectral information while also combining cone signals to shape grayscale functions. We address this question by imaging the light-driven responses of amacrine cells (ACs) and bipolar cells (BCs) in larval zebrafish in the presence and pharmacological absence of inner retinal inhibition. We find that ACs enhance opponency in some bipolar cells while at the same time suppressing pre-existing opponency in others, so that, depending on the retinal region, the net change in the number of color-opponent units is essentially zero. To achieve this “dynamic balance,” ACs counteract intrinsic color opponency of BCs via the On channel. Consistent with these observations, Off-stratifying ACs are exclusively achromatic, while all color-opponent ACs stratify in the On sublamina.

Abstract: Summary
Plakophilin 3 (PKP3) is a component of desmosomes and is frequently overexpressed in cancer. Using keratinocytes either lacking or overexpressing PKP3, we identify a signaling axis from ERK to the retinoblastoma (RB) protein and the E2F1 transcription factor that is controlled by PKP3. RB and E2F1 are key components controlling G1/S transition in the cell cycle. We show that PKP3 stimulates the activity of ERK and its target RSK1. This inhibits expression of the transcription factor RUNX3, a positive regulator of the CDK inhibitor CDKN1A/p21, which is also downregulated by PKP3. Elevated CDKN1A prevents RB phosphorylation and E2F1 target gene expression, leading to delayed S phase entry and reduced proliferation in PKP3-depleted cells. Elevated PKP3 expression not only increases ERK activity but also captures phosphorylated RB (phospho-RB) in the cytoplasm to promote E2F1 activity and cell-cycle progression. These data identify a mechanism by which PKP3 promotes proliferation and acts as an oncogene.

Abstract: Summary
The physiological functions of several organs rely on branched epithelial tubule networks bearing specialized structures for secretion, gas exchange, or filtration. Little is known about conflicts in development between building enough tubules for adequate function and geometric constraints imposed by organ size. We show that the mouse embryonic kidney epithelium negotiates a physical packing conflict between increasing tubule tip numbers through branching and limited organ surface area. Through imaging of whole kidney explants, combined with computational and soft material modeling of tubule families, we identify six possible geometric packing phases, including two defective ones. Experiments in explants show that a radially oriented tension on tubule families is necessary and sufficient for them to switch to a vertical packing arrangement that increases surface tip density while avoiding defects. These results reveal developmental contingencies in response to physical limitations and create a framework for classifying congenital kidney defects.

Abstract: Summary
Ordered protein phosphorylation by CDKs is a key mechanism for regulating the cell cycle. How temporal order is enforced in mammalian cells remains unclear. Using a fixed cell kinase assay and phosphoproteomics, we show how CDK1 activity and non-catalytic CDK1 subunits contribute to the choice of substrate and site of phosphorylation. Increases in CDK1 activity alter substrate choice, with intermediate- and low-sensitivity CDK1 substrates enriched in DNA replication and mitotic functions, respectively. This activity dependence is shared between Cyclin A- and Cyclin B-CDK1. Cks1 has a proteome-wide role as an enhancer of multisite CDK1 phosphorylation. Contrary to the model of CDK1 as an exclusively proline-directed kinase, we show that Cyclin A and Cks1 enhance non-proline-directed phosphorylation, preferably on sites with a +3 lysine residue. Indeed, 70% of cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylations, where the kinase carrying out this modification has not been identified, are non-proline-directed CDK1 sites.

Abstract: Summary
PGC-1α is well established as a metazoan transcriptional coactivator of cellular adaptation in response to stress. However, the mechanisms by which PGC-1α activates gene transcription are incompletely understood. Here, we report that PGC-1α serves as a scaffold protein that physically and functionally connects the DNA-binding protein estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), cap-binding protein 80 (CBP80), and Mediator to overcome promoter-proximal pausing of RNAPII and transcriptionally activate stress-response genes. We show that PGC-1α promotes pausing release in a two-arm mechanism (1) by recruiting the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and (2) by outcompeting the premature transcription termination complex Integrator. Using mice homozygous for five amino acid changes in the CBP80-binding motif (CBM) of PGC-1α that destroy CBM function, we show that efficient differentiation of primary myoblasts to myofibers and timely skeletal muscle regeneration after injury require PGC-1α binding to CBP80. Our findings reveal how PGC-1α activates stress-response gene transcription in a previously unanticipated pre-mRNA quality-control pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The aim of this work is to provide a comment on a recent paper by Muzzu and Saleem (2021), which claims that visuomotor mismatch responses in mouse visual cortex can be explained by a locomotion-induced gain of visual halt responses. Our primary concern is that without directly comparing these responses with mismatch responses, the claim that one response can explain the other appears difficult to uphold, more so because previous work finds that a uniform locomotion-induced gain cannot explain mismatch responses. To support these arguments, we analyze layer 2/3 calcium imaging datasets and show that coupling between visual flow and locomotion greatly enhances mismatch responses in an experience-dependent manner compared with halts in non-coupled visual flow. This is consistent with mismatch responses representing visuomotor prediction errors. Thus, we conclude that while feature selectivity might contribute to mismatch responses in mouse visual cortex, it cannot explain these responses.

Abstract: Summary
Kainate receptors (KARs) are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that control synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and are implicated in neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding the regulation of KAR function by small molecules is essential for exploring these receptors as drug targets. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of KAR GluK2 in complex with the positive allosteric modulator BPAM344, competitive antagonist DNQX, and negative allosteric modulator, antiepileptic drug perampanel. Our structures show that two BPAM344 molecules bind per ligand-binding domain dimer interface. In the absence of an agonist or in the presence of DNQX, BPAM344 stabilizes GluK2 in the closed state. The closed state is also stabilized by perampanel, which binds to the ion channel extracellular collar sites located in two out of four GluK2 subunits. The molecular mechanisms of positive and negative allosteric modulation of KAR provide a guide for developing new therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Cisplatin- and gemcitabine-based chemotherapeutics represent a mainstay of cancer therapy for most solid tumors; however, resistance limits their curative potential. Here, we identify RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 (PAF1) as a common driver of cisplatin and gemcitabine resistance in human cancers (ovarian, lung, and pancreas). Mechanistically, cisplatin- and gemcitabine-resistant cells show enhanced DNA repair, which is inhibited by PAF1 silencing. We demonstrate an increased interaction of PAF1 with RAD52 in resistant cells. Targeting the PAF1 and RAD52 axis combined with cisplatin or gemcitabine strongly diminishes the survival potential of resistant cells. Overall, this study shows clinical evidence that the expression of PAF1 contributes to chemotherapy resistance and worse clinical outcome for lethal cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Development of liver fibrosis is paralleled by contraction of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main profibrotic hepatic cells. Yet, little is known about the interplay of neprilysin (NEP) and its substrate neuropeptide Y (NPY), a potent enhancer of contraction, in liver fibrosis. We demonstrate that HSCs are the source of NEP. Importantly, NPY originates majorly from the splanchnic region and is cleaved by NEP in order to terminate contraction. Interestingly, NEP deficiency (Nep−/−) showed less fibrosis but portal hypertension upon liver injury in two different fibrosis models in mice. We demonstrate the incremental benefit of Nep−/− in addition to AT1R blocker (ARB) or ACE inhibitors for fibrosis and portal hypertension. Finally, oral administration of Entresto, a combination of ARB and NEP inhibitor, decreased hepatic fibrosis and portal pressure in mice. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for translation of NEP-AT1R-blockade in human liver fibrosis and portal hypertension.

Abstract: Summary
During pre-implantation stages of mammalian development, maternally stored material promotes both the erasure of the sperm and oocyte epigenetic profiles and is responsible for concomitant genome activation. Here, we have utilized single-cell methylome and transcriptome sequencing (scM&T-seq) to quantify both mRNA expression and DNA methylation in oocytes and a developmental series of human embryos at single-cell resolution. We fully characterize embryonic genome activation and maternal transcript degradation and map key epigenetic reprogramming events in developmentally high-quality embryos. By comparing these signatures with early embryos that have undergone spontaneous cleavage-stage arrest, as determined by time-lapse imaging, we identify embryos that fail to appropriately activate their genomes or undergo epigenetic reprogramming. Our results indicate that a failure to successfully accomplish these essential milestones impedes the developmental potential of pre-implantation embryos and is likely to have important implications, similar to aneuploidy, for the success of assisted reproductive cycles.

Abstract: Summary
Aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic pathway essential for effector T cell survival and proliferation, regulates differentiation of autoimmune T helper (Th) 17 cells, but the mechanism underlying this regulation is largely unknown. Here, we identify a glycolytic intermediate metabolite, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), as a negative regulator of Th17 differentiation. PEP supplementation or inhibition of downstream glycolytic enzymes in differentiating Th17 cells increases intracellular PEP levels and inhibits interleukin (IL)-17A expression. PEP supplementation inhibits expression of signature molecules for Th17 and Th2 cells but does not significantly affect glycolysis, cell proliferation, or survival of T helper cells. Mechanistically, PEP binds to JunB and inhibits DNA binding of the JunB/basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF)/interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) complex, thereby modulating the Th17 transcriptional program. Furthermore, daily administration of PEP to mice inhibits generation of Th17 cells and ameliorates Th17-dependent autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These data demonstrate that PEP links aerobic glycolysis to the Th17 transcriptional program, suggesting the therapeutic potential of PEP for autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Type I CRISPR-Cas systems employ multi-subunit Cascade effector complexes to target foreign nucleic acids for destruction. Here, we present structures of D. vulgaris type I-C Cascade at various stages of double-stranded (ds)DNA target capture, revealing mechanisms that underpin PAM recognition and Cascade allosteric activation. We uncover an interesting mechanism of non-target strand (NTS) DNA stabilization via stacking interactions with the “belly” subunits, securing the NTS in place. This “molecular seatbelt” mechanism facilitates efficient R-loop formation and prevents dsDNA reannealing. Additionally, we provide structural insights into how two anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins utilize distinct strategies to achieve a shared mechanism of type I-C Cascade inhibition by blocking PAM scanning. These observations form a structural basis for directional R-loop formation and reveal how different Acr proteins have converged upon common molecular mechanisms to efficiently shut down CRISPR immunity.

Abstract: Ellagic acid (EA), found in fruits and foods, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of breast, colon and bladder cancer. However, due to the complexity of colon cancer, the therapeutic mechanism of EA for colon cancer is still unclear. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay were employed to investigate the cell proliferation. Western blotting and flow cytometry assays were utilized to investigate apoptosis and autophagy in CRC cells (HCT116), respectively. Moreover, western blotting and luciferase reporter assays were evaluated the effect of EA on AMPK/mTOR pathway. Through flow cytometry analysis, EA could promote the apoptosis of HCT116 cells. In addition, EA can reduce the phosphorylation of mTOR, promoted phosphorylation of AMPK, and induced autophagy in HCT116 cells. Also, Dorsomorphin pretreatment can reduce the expression of autophagy protein, which indicates that EA induces autophagy through AMPK/mTOR pathway. These results suggest that EA inhibits the growth of colon cancer through AMPK/mTOR pathway and induces apoptosis and protective autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic changes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks underlie all physiological cellular functions and drive devastating human diseases. Profiling PPI networks can, therefore, provide critical insight into disease mechanisms and identify new drug targets. Kinases are regulatory nodes in many PPI networks; yet, facile methods to systematically study kinase interactome dynamics are lacking. We describe kinobead competition and correlation analysis (kiCCA), a quantitative mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomic method for rapid and highly multiplexed profiling of endogenous kinase interactomes. Using kiCCA, we identified 1,154 PPIs of 238 kinases across 18 diverse cancer lines, quantifying context-dependent kinase interactome changes linked to cancer type, plasticity, and signaling states, thereby assembling an extensive knowledgebase for cell signaling research. We discovered drug target candidates, including an endocytic adapter-associated kinase (AAK1) complex that promotes cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and drug resistance. Our data demonstrate the importance of kinase interactome dynamics for cellular signaling in health and disease.

Abstract: CRISPR-Cas12a based one-pot detection system has been used in nucleic acid detection and diagnosis. However, it is not sensitive enough to distinguish single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), which has greatly restricted its application. To overcome these limitations, we engineered a LbCas12a variant with enhanced sensitivity against SNP, named seCas12a (sensitive Cas12a). SeCas12a-based one-pot SNP detection system is a versatile platform that could use both canonical and non-canonical PAM, and was almost not limited by mutation types to distinguish SNPs located between position 1 to 17. The use of truncated crRNA further improved SNP specificity of seCas12a. Mechanistically, we found only when the cis-cleavage was at low level between 0.01min−1 and 0.0006 min−1, a good signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved in one-pot test. SeCas12a-based one-pot SNP detection system was applied to detect pharmacogenomic SNPs in human clinical samples. Of thirteen donors tested in two different SNPs, the seCas12a mediated one-pot system could faithfully detect the SNPs in 30 min with 100% accuracy.

Abstract: Summary
The development of the mouse salivary gland involves a tip-driven process of branching morphogenesis that takes place in concert with differentiation into acinar, myoepithelial, and ductal (basal and luminal) sub-lineages. By combining clonal lineage tracing with a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the branched epithelial network and single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we show that in tips, a heterogeneous population of renewing progenitors transition from a Krt14+ multipotent state to unipotent states via two transcriptionally distinct bipotent states, one restricted to the Krt14+ basal and myoepithelial lineage and the other to the Krt8+ acinar and luminal lineage. Using genetic perturbations, we show how the differential expression of Notch signaling correlates with spatial segregation, exits from multipotency, and promotes the Krt8+ lineage, whereas Kras activation promotes proacinar fate. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for how positional cues within growing tips regulate the process of lineage segregation and ductal patterning.

Abstract: Summary
Senescent cells can spread the senescent phenotype to other cells by secreting senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. The resulting paracrine senescent cells make a significant contribution to the burden of senescent cell accumulation with age. Previous efforts made to characterize paracrine senescence are unreliable due to analyses being based on mixed populations of senescent and non-senescent cells. Here, we use dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as a surface maker to isolate senescent cells from mixed populations. Using this technique, we enrich the percentage of paracrine senescence from 40% to 85%. We then use this enriched culture to characterize DPP4+ primary and paracrine senescent cells. We observe ferroptosis dysregulation and ferrous iron accumulation as a common phenomenon in both primary and paracrine senescent cells. Finally, we identify ferroptosis induction and ferrous iron-activatable prodrug as a broad-spectrum senolytic approach to ablate multiple types of primary and paracrine senescent cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive control involves flexibly combining multiple sensory inputs with task-dependent goals during decision making. Several tasks involving conflicting sensory inputs and motor outputs have been proposed to examine cognitive control, including the Stroop, Flanker, and multi-source interference task. Because these tasks have been studied independently, it remains unclear whether the neural signatures of cognitive control reflect abstract control mechanisms or specific combinations of sensory and behavioral aspects of each task. To address these questions, we record invasive neurophysiological signals from 16 patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy and compare neural responses within and between tasks. Neural signals differ between incongruent and congruent conditions, showing strong modulation by conflicting task demands. These neural signals are mostly specific to each task, generalizing within a task but not across tasks. These results highlight the complex interplay between sensory inputs, motor outputs, and task demands underlying cognitive control processes.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac maturation is crucial for postnatal cardiac development and is increasingly known to be regulated by a series of transcription factors. However, post-translational mechanisms regulating this process remain unclear. Here we report the indispensable role of neddylation in cardiac maturation. Mosaic deletion of NAE1, an essential enzyme for neddylation, in neonatal hearts results in the rapid development of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. NAE1 deficiency disrupts transverse tubule formation, inhibits physiological hypertrophy, and represses fetal-to-adult isoform switching, thus culminating in cardiomyocyte immaturation. Mechanistically, we find that neddylation is needed for the perinatal metabolic transition from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism in cardiomyocytes. Further, we show that HIF1α is a putative neddylation target and that inhibition of neddylation accumulates HIF1α and impairs fatty acid utilization and bioenergetics in cardiomyocytes. Together, our data show neddylation is required for cardiomyocyte maturation through promoting oxidative metabolism in the developing heart.

Abstract: The O subfamily of forkhead (FoxO) 1 may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular endothelial injury. However, it is unknown whether D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) regulates cardiac microvascular endothelial FoxO1 to play protective roles in diabetes. In the study, limb microvascular morphological changes, endothelial distribution of the tight junction protein Claudin-5 and FoxO1, and FoxO1 content in limb tissue from clinical patients were evaluated. Then the effects of BHB on cardiac microvascular morphological changes, cardiac FoxO1 generation and its microvascular distribution in diabetic rats were measured. And the effects of BHB on FoxO1 generation in high glucose (HG)-stimulated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) were further analyzed. The results firstly confirmed the enhanced limb microvascular FoxO1 distribution, with reduced Claudin-5 and endothelial injury in clinical patients. Then the elevated FoxO1 generation and its enhanced cardiac microvascular distribution were verified in diabetic rats and HG-stimulated HCMECs. However, BHB inhibited the enhanced cardiac FoxO1 generation and its microvascular distribution with attenuation of endothelial injury in diabetic rats. Furthermore, BHB reduced the HG-stimulated mRNA expression and protein content of FoxO1 in HCMECs. In conclusion, BHB reduced the enhanced cardiac microvascular endothelial FoxO1 to play protective roles in diabetic rats and HG-stimulated HCMECs.

Abstract: Summary
In proliferating neoplasms, microenvironment-derived selective pressures promote tumor heterogeneity by imparting diverse capacities for growth, differentiation, and invasion. However, what makes a tumor cell respond to signaling cues differently from a normal cell is not well understood. In the Drosophila ovarian follicle cells, apicobasal-polarity loss induces heterogeneous epithelial multilayering. When exacerbated by oncogenic-Notch expression, this multilayer displays an increased consistency in the occurrence of morphologically distinguishable cells adjacent to the polar follicle cells. Polar cells release the Jak/STAT ligand Unpaired (Upd), in response to which neighboring polarity-deficient cells exhibit a precursor-like transcriptomic state. Among the several regulons active in these cells, we could detect and further validate the expression of Snail family transcription factor Escargot (Esg). We also ascertain a similar relationship between Upd and Esg in normally developing ovaries, where establishment of polarity determines early follicular differentiation. Overall, our results indicate that epithelial-cell polarity acts as a gatekeeper against microenvironmental selective pressures that drive heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
The relationship between mRNA translation and decay is incompletely understood, with conflicting reports suggesting that translation can either promote decay or stabilize mRNAs. The effect of translation on mRNA decay has mainly been studied using ensemble measurements and global transcription and translation inhibitors, which can have pleiotropic effects. We developed a single-molecule imaging approach to control the translation of a specific transcript that enabled simultaneous measurement of translation and mRNA decay. Our results demonstrate that mRNA translation reduces mRNA stability, and mathematical modeling suggests that this process is dependent on ribosome flux. Furthermore, our results indicate that miRNAs mediate efficient degradation of both translating and non-translating target mRNAs and reveal a predominant role for mRNA degradation in miRNA-mediated regulation. Simultaneous observation of translation and decay of single mRNAs provides a framework to directly study how these processes are interconnected in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Genome instability can drive aging in many organisms. The ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) cluster is one of the most unstable regions in the genome and the stability of this region impacts replicative lifespan in budding yeast. To understand the underlying mechanism, we search for yeast mutants with stabler rDNA and longer lifespans than wild-type cells. We show that absence of a transcription elongation factor, Spt4, results in increased rDNA stability, reduced levels of non-coding RNA transcripts from the regulatory E-pro promoter in the rDNA, and extended replicative lifespan in a SIR2-dependent manner. Spt4-dependent lifespan restriction is abolished in the absence of non-coding RNA transcription at the E-pro locus. The amount of Spt4 increases and its function becomes more important as cells age. These findings suggest that Spt4 is a promising aging factor that accelerates cellular senescence through rDNA instability driven by non-coding RNA transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Iron recycling prevents the development of anemia under homeostatic conditions. Whether iron recycling was co-opted as a defense strategy to prevent the development of anemia in response to infection is unclear. We find that in severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the onset of life-threatening anemia is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), irrespective of parasite load. Using a well-established experimental rodent model of malaria anemia, we identify a transcriptional response that endows renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) with the capacity to store and recycle iron during P. chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc) infection. This response encompasses the induction of ferroportin 1/SLC40A1, which exports iron from RPTECs and counteracts AKI while supporting compensatory erythropoiesis and preventing the onset of life-threatening malarial anemia. Iron recycling by myeloid cells is dispensable to this protective response, suggesting that RPTECs provide an iron-recycling salvage pathway that prevents the pathogenesis of life-threatening malarial anemia.

Abstract: Summary
Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the main risk factor for gastric cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The oncogenic functions of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) are not fully understood in gastric tumorigenesis. Using public datasets, quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, we detect high levels of CDK1 in human and mouse gastric tumors. H. pylori infection induces activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) with a significant increase in CDK1 in in vitro and in vivo models (p < 0.01). We confirm active NF-κB binding sites on the CDK1 promoter sequence. CDK1 phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3β activity through direct binding with subsequent accumulation and activation of β-catenin. CDK1 silencing or pharmacologic inhibition reverses these effects and impairs tumor organoids and spheroid formation. IHC analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between CDK1 and β-catenin. The results demonstrate a mechanistic link between infection, inflammation, and gastric tumorigenesis where CDK1 plays a critical role.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors with mutations in chromatin regulators present attractive targets for DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) therapy, which further disrupts cancer cells’ epigenomic fidelity and reactivates transposable element (TE) expression to drive viral mimicry responses. SETD2 encodes a histone methyltransferase (H3K36me3) and is prevalently mutated in advanced kidney cancers. Here, we show that SETD2-mutant kidney cancer cells are especially sensitive in vitro and in vivo to DAC treatment. We find that the viral mimicry response are direct consequences of mis-splicing events, such as exon inclusions or extensions, triggered by DAC treatment in an SETD2-loss context. Comprehensive epigenomic analysis reveals H3K9me3 deposition, rather than DNA methylation dynamics, across intronic TEs might contribute to elevated mis-splicing rates. Through epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses, we show that SETD2-deficient kidney cancers are prone to mis-splicing, which can be therapeutically exacerbated with DAC treatment to increase viral mimicry activation and provide synergy with combinatorial immunotherapy approaches.

Abstract: Summary
The chromatin environment at origins of replication is thought to influence DNA replication initiation in eukaryotic genomes. However, it remains unclear how and which chromatin features control the firing of early-efficient (EE) or late-inefficient (LI) origins. Here, we use site-specific recombination and single-locus chromatin isolation to purify EE and LI replication origins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using mass spectrometry, we define the protein composition of native chromatin regions surrounding the EE and LI replication start sites. In addition to known origin interactors, we find the microtubule-binding Ask1/DASH complex as an origin-regulating factor. Strikingly, tethering of Ask1 to individual origin sites advances replication timing (RT) of the targeted chromosomal domain. Targeted degradation of Ask1 globally changes RT of a subset of origins, which can be reproduced by inhibiting microtubule dynamics. Thus, our findings mechanistically connect RT and chromosomal organization via Ask1/DASH with the microtubule cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 T helper (Th2) cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) provide protection against helminth infection and are involved in allergic responses. However, their relative importance and crosstalk during type 2 immune responses are still controversial. By generating and utilizing mouse strains that are deficient in either ILC2s or Th2 cells, we report that interleukin (IL)-33-mediated ILC2 activation promotes the Th2 cell response to papain; however, the Th2 cell response to ovalbumin (OVA)/alum immunization is thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) dependent but independent of ILC2s. During helminth infection, ILC2s and Th2 cells collaborate at different phases of the immune responses. Th2 cells, mainly through IL-4 production, induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, among which IL-25 and IL-33 redundantly promote ILC2 expansion. Thus, while Th2 cell differentiation can occur independently of ILC2s, activation of ILC2s may promote Th2 responses, and Th2 cells can expand ILC2s by inducing type 2 alarmins.

Abstract: Summary
La Crosse virus, responsible for pediatric encephalitis in the United States, and Schmallenberg virus, a highly teratogenic veterinary virus in Europe, belong to the large Orthobunyavirus genus of zoonotic arthropod-borne pathogens distributed worldwide. Viruses in this under-studied genus cause CNS infections or fever with debilitating arthralgia/myalgia syndromes, with no effective treatment. The main surface antigen, glycoprotein Gc (∼1,000 residues), has a variable N-terminal half (GcS) targeted by the patients’ antibody response and a conserved C-terminal moiety (GcF) responsible for membrane fusion during cell entry. Here, we report the X-ray structure of post-fusion La Crosse and Schmallenberg virus GcF, revealing the molecular determinants for hairpin formation and trimerization required to drive membrane fusion. We further experimentally confirm the role of residues in the fusion loops and in a vestigial endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation sequence at the GcS-GcF junction. The resulting knowledge provides essential molecular underpinnings for future development of potential therapeutic treatments and vaccines.

Abstract: Background
Dementia poses a serious threat to the daily and social abilities of patients, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a metabolite of the gut microbiota involved in regulating the inflammatory response. However, the role of TMAO in dementia needs further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of TMAO on dementia, which may provide ideas for the treatment of dementia.
Materials and methods
Dementia mice were induced by D-galactose + AlCl3, and the changes in learning memory capacity, histopathology, inflammatory factors, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR in mice treated with TMAO were analyzed to determine the mechanism of TMAO action on dementia. In addition, the effect of TMAO+PI3K inhibitor treatment on mice was also analyzed to further determine the mechanism of TMAO effect on dementia.
Results
The results revealed that the dementia group had significantly higher TMAO levels and a significant hippocampal injury and inflammatory response. TMAO treatment promoted hippocampal injury and promoted the level of inflammatory cytokines. Further study of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway showed that the expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR was significantly increased in the dementia group, and it was more obvious after TMAO treatment. And hippocampal injury, inflammatory response, and increase of p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR were reversed by TMAO+PI3K inhibitor.
Conclusions
This study determined that TMAO promotes dementia through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting that TMAO may be a potential target for dementia.

Abstract: Summary
Resolution of ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) must be completed before cytokinesis to ensure sister-chromatid disjunction. RIF1 is involved in UFB resolution by a mechanism that is not yet clear. Here, we show that RIF1 functions in mitosis to inhibit the formation of 53BP1 nuclear bodies and micronuclei. Meanwhile, RIF1 localizes on PICH-coated double-stranded UFBs but not on RPA-coated single-stranded UFBs. Depletion of RIF1 leads to an elevated level of RPA-coated UFBs, in a BLM-dependent manner. RIF1 interacts with all three isoforms of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) at its CI domain in anaphase when CDK1 activity declines. CDK1 negatively regulates RIF1-PP1 interaction via the CIII domain of RIF1. Importantly, depletion of PP1 phenocopies RIF1 depletion, and phosphorylation-resistant mutant of PICH shows reduced interaction with the BTR complex and bypasses the need of RIF1 in preventing the formation of single-stranded UFBs. Overall, our data show that PP1 is the effector of RIF1 in UFB resolution.

Abstract: Summary
TGF-β induces senescence in embryonic tissues. Whether TGF-β in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) induces senescence in cancer and how the ensuing senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) remodels the cellular TME to influence immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) responses are unknown. We show that TGF-β induces a deeper senescent state under hypoxia than under normoxia; deep senescence correlates with the degree of E2F suppression and is marked by multinucleation, reduced reentry into proliferation, and a distinct 14-gene SASP. Suppressing TGF-β signaling in tumors in an immunocompetent mouse lung cancer model abrogates endogenous senescent cells and suppresses the 14-gene SASP and immune infiltration. Untreated human lung cancers with a high 14-gene SASP display immunosuppressive immune infiltration. In a lung cancer clinical trial of ICIs, elevated 14-gene SASP is associated with increased senescence, TGF-β and hypoxia signaling, and poor progression-free survival. Thus, TME-induced senescence may represent a naturally occurring state in cancer, contributing to an immune-suppressive phenotype associated with immune therapy resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres are essential for chromosome segregation in most animals and plants yet are among the most rapidly evolving genome elements. The mechanisms underlying this paradoxical phenomenon remain enigmatic. Here, we report that human centromeres innately harbor a striking enrichment of DNA breaks within functionally active centromere regions. Establishing a single-cell imaging strategy that enables comparative assessment of DNA breaks at repetitive regions, we show that centromeric DNA breaks are induced not only during active cellular proliferation but also de novo during quiescence. Markedly, centromere DNA breaks in quiescent cells are resolved enzymatically by the evolutionarily conserved RAD51 recombinase, which in turn safeguards the specification of functional centromeres. This study highlights the innate fragility of centromeres, which may have been co-opted over time to reinforce centromere specification while driving rapid evolution. The findings also provide insights into how fragile centromeres are likely to contribute to human disease.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebellum is critical for motor coordination and learning. However, the role of feedback circuitry in this brain region has not been fully explored. Here, we characterize a nucleo-ponto-cortical feedback pathway in classical delayed eyeblink conditioning (dEBC) of rats. We find that the efference copy is conveyed from the interposed cerebellar nucleus (Int) to cerebellar cortex through pontine nucleus (PN). Inhibiting or exciting the projection from the Int to the PN can decelerate or speed up acquisition of dEBC, respectively. Importantly, we identify two subpopulations of PN neurons (PN1 and PN2) that convey and integrate the feedback signals with feedforward sensory signals. We also show that the feedforward and feedback pathways via different types of PN neurons contribute to the plastic changes and cooperate synergistically to the learning of dEBC. Our results suggest that this excitatory nucleo-ponto-cortical feedback plays a significant role in modulating associative motor learning in cerebellum.

Abstract: Summary
Long bones are generated by mesoderm-derived skeletal progenitor/stem cells (SSCs) through endochondral ossification, a process of sequential chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation tightly controlled by the synergy between intrinsic and microenvironment cues. Here, we report that loss of TRIM28, a transcriptional corepressor, in mesoderm-derived cells expands the SSC pool, weakens SSC osteochondrogenic potential, and endows SSCs with properties of ectoderm-derived neural crest cells (NCCs), leading to severe defects of skeletogenesis. TRIM28 preferentially enhances H3K9 trimethylation and DNA methylation on chromatin regions more accessible in NCCs; loss of this silencing upregulates neural gene expression and enhances neurogenic potential. Moreover, TRIM28 loss causes hyperexpression of GREM1, which is an extracellular signaling factor promoting SSC self-renewal and SSC neurogenic potential by activating AKT/mTORC1 signaling. Our results suggest that TRIM28-mediated chromatin silencing establishes a barrier for maintaining the SSC lineage trajectory and preventing a transition to ectodermal fate by regulating both intrinsic and microenvironment cues.

Abstract: The physical and geometric aspects of notochords are investigated using a model of finite-length notochords, with interior vacuolated cells arranged in two common packing configurations, and sheath modeled as homogeneous and thin. The key ratios governing packing patterns and eccentricity are number of cells per unit length λ and cell tension ratio Γ. By analyzing simulations that vary Γ and total number of cells N, we find that eccentricity, λ, and internal pressure approach consistent asymptotic values away from the tapering ends, as N increases. The length of the tapering ends is quantified as a function of Γ and pattern. Formulas are derived for geometric ratios, pressure, and energy as functions of Γ and pattern. These observations on the relationship between mechanics, geometry, and pattern provide a framework for further work which may provide insight into the roles of mechanosensing and pressure-volume regulation in the notochord.

Abstract: Summary
p53 is a key tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in human tumors. In this study, we investigated how p53 is regulated in precancerous lesions prior to mutations in the p53 gene. Analyzing esophageal cells in conditions of genotoxic stress that promotes development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, we find that p53 protein is adducted with reactive isolevuglandins (isoLGs), products of lipid peroxidation. Modification of p53 protein with isoLGs diminishes its acetylation and binding to the promoters of p53 target genes causing modulation of p53-dependent transcription. It also leads to accumulation of adducted p53 protein in intracellular amyloid-like aggregates that can be inhibited by isoLG scavenger 2-HOBA in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our studies reveal a posttranslational modification of p53 protein that causes molecular aggregation of p53 protein and its non-mutational inactivation in conditions of DNA damage that may play an important role in human tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The notochord is a defining feature of all chordates. The transcription factors Zic and ETS regulate enhancer activity within the notochord. We conduct high-throughput screens of genomic elements within developing Ciona embryos to understand how Zic and ETS sites encode notochord activity. Our screen discovers an enhancer located near Lama, a gene critical for notochord development. Reversing the orientation of an ETS site within this enhancer abolishes expression, indicating that enhancer grammar is critical for notochord activity. Similarly organized clusters of Zic and ETS sites occur within mouse and human Lama1 introns. Within a Brachyury (Bra) enhancer, FoxA and Bra, in combination with Zic and ETS binding sites, are necessary and sufficient for notochord expression. This binding site logic also occurs within other Ciona and vertebrate Bra enhancers. Collectively, this study uncovers the importance of grammar within notochord enhancers and discovers signatures of enhancer logic and grammar conserved across chordates.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin organization must be maintained during cell proliferation to preserve cellular identity and genome integrity. However, DNA replication results in transient displacement of DNA-bound proteins, and it is unclear how they regain access to newly replicated DNA. Using quantitative proteomics coupled to Nascent Chromatin Capture or isolation of Proteins on Nascent DNA, we provide time-resolved binding kinetics for thousands of proteins behind replisomes within euchromatin and heterochromatin in human cells. This shows that most proteins regain access within minutes to newly replicated DNA. In contrast, 25% of the identified proteins do not, and this delay cannot be inferred from their known function or nuclear abundance. Instead, chromatin organization and G1 phase entry affect their reassociation. Finally, DNA replication not only disrupts but also promotes recruitment of transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, providing a significant advance in understanding how DNA replication could contribute to programmed changes of cell memory.

Abstract: Summary
Although the consumption of carbohydrates is needed for survival, their potent reinforcing properties drive obesity worldwide. In turn, sugar overconsumption reveals a major role for brain reward systems in regulating sugar intake. However, it remains elusive how different cell types within the reward circuitries control the initiation and termination of sugary meals. Here, we identified the distinct nucleus accumbens cell types that mediate the chemosensory versus postprandial properties of sweet sugars. Specifically, D1 neurons enhance sugar intake via specialized connections to taste ganglia, whereas D2 neurons mediate the termination of sugary meals via anatomical connections to circuits involved in appetite suppression. Consistently, D2, but not D1, neurons partially mediate the satiating effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists. Thus, these nucleus accumbens cell types function as a behavioral switch, enabling positive versus negative control over sugar intake. Our study contributes to unveiling the cellular and circuit substrates of sugar overconsumption.

Abstract: Human labial glands consist of saliva-secreting cells which are formed by serous and predominantly mucous glandular cells. The following excretory duct system converts the isotonic saliva into a hypotonic fluid. Liquids are transported across the membrane of epithelial cells by paracellular or transcellular mode of action. We studied aquaporins (AQP) and tight junction proteins in the endpieces and duct system of human labial glands of 3–5-month-old infants for the first time. AQP1, AQP3, and AQP5 represent the transcellular transport; tight junction proteins like claudin-1, − 3, − 4, and − 7 regulate the permeability of the paracellular pathway. Specimens of 28 infants were included in this study and analyzed histologically. AQP1 was present in myoepithelial cells and in endothelial cells of small blood vessels. AQP3 showed basolateral plasmamembrane localization in glandular endpieces. AQP5 was localized at the apical cytomembrane in serous and mucous glandular cells and at the lateral membrane in serous cells. Ducts remained unstained with the antibody to AQP1, AQP3, and AQP5. Claudin-1, − 3, − 4, and − 7 were expressed mainly in the lateral plasmamembrane of serous glandular cells. In the ducts, claudin-1, − 4, and − 7 were detected at the basal cell layer, claudin-7 also at the lateral cytomembrane. Our findings provide new insights into the localization of epithelial barrier components necessary for regulating saliva-modification in infantile labial glands.

Abstract: Summary
Despite their barrier function, epithelia can locally lose their integrity to create physiological openings during morphogenesis. The mechanisms driving the formation of these epithelial breaks are only starting to be investigated. Here, we study the formation of the zebrafish nostril (the olfactory orifice), which opens in the skin epithelium to expose the olfactory neurons to external odorant cues. Combining live imaging, drug treatments, laser ablation, and tissue-specific functional perturbations, we characterize a mechanical interplay between olfactory placode neurons and the skin, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the orifice: the neurons pull on the overlying skin cells in an actomyosin-dependent manner which, in combination with a local reorganization of the skin epithelium, triggers the opening of the orifice. This work identifies an original mechanism to break an epithelial sheet, in which an adjacent group of cells mechanically assists the epithelium to induce its local rupture.

Abstract: Summary
Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is a peripheral T cell lymphoma that originates from T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and exhibits a prominent tumor microenvironment (TME). IDH2 and TET2 mutations co-occur frequently in AITL, but their contribution to tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We developed an AITL mouse model that is driven by Idh2 and Tet2 mutations. Malignant Tfh cells display aberrant transcriptomic and epigenetic programs that impair TCR signaling. Neoplastic Tfh cells bearing combined Idh2 and Tet2 mutations show altered cross-talk with germinal center B cells that promotes B cell clonal expansion while decreasing Fas-FasL interaction and reducing B cell apoptosis. The plasma cell count and angiogenesis are also increased in the Idh2-mutated tumors, implying a major relationship between Idh2 mutation and the characteristic AITL TME. Our mouse model recapitulates several features of human IDH2-mutated AITL and provides a rationale for exploring therapeutic targeting of Tfh-TME cross-talk for AITL patients.

Abstract: Summary
How enhancers interpret morphogen gradients to generate gene expression patterns is a central question in developmental biology. Recent studies have proposed that enhancers can dictate whether, when, and at what rate promoters engage in transcription, but the complexity of endogenous enhancers calls for theoretical models with too many free parameters to quantitatively dissect these regulatory strategies. To overcome this limitation, we established a minimal promoter-proximal synthetic enhancer in embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, a gradient of the Dorsal activator is read by a single Dorsal DNA binding site. Using live imaging to quantify transcriptional activity, we found that a single binding site can regulate whether promoters engage in transcription in a concentration-dependent manner. By modulating the binding-site affinity, we determined that a gene’s decision to transcribe and its transcriptional onset time can be explained by a simple model where the promoter traverses multiple kinetic barriers before transcription can ensue.

Abstract: Summary
TEAD1 and the mammalian Hippo pathway regulate cellular proliferation and function, though their regulatory function in β cells remains poorly characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that while β cell-specific TEAD1 deletion results in a cell-autonomous increase of β cell proliferation, β cell-specific deletion of its canonical coactivators, YAP and TAZ, does not affect proliferation, suggesting the involvement of other cofactors. Using an improved split-GFP system and yeast two-hybrid platform, we identify VGLL4 and MENIN as TEAD1 corepressors in β cells. We show that VGLL4 and MENIN bind to TEAD1 and repress the expression of target genes, including FZD7 and CCN2, which leads to an inhibition of β cell proliferation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TEAD1 plays a critical role in β cell proliferation and identify VGLL4 and MENIN as TEAD1 corepressors in β cells. We propose that these could be targeted to augment proliferation in β cells for reversing diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells promote the recruitment of immunosuppressive neutrophils, a subset of myeloid cells driving immune suppression, tumor proliferation, and treatment resistance. Physiologically, neutrophils are known to have a short half-life. Here, we report the identification of a subset of neutrophils that have upregulated expression of cellular senescence markers and persist in the tumor microenvironment. Senescent-like neutrophils express the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and are more immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting than canonical immunosuppressive neutrophils. Genetic and pharmacological elimination of senescent-like neutrophils decreases tumor progression in different mouse models of prostate cancer. Mechanistically, we have found that apolipoprotein E (APOE) secreted by prostate tumor cells binds TREM2 on neutrophils, promoting their senescence. APOE and TREM2 expression increases in prostate cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. Collectively, these results reveal an alternative mechanism of tumor immune evasion and support the development of immune senolytics targeting senescent-like neutrophils for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian digit tip regeneration is linked to the presence of nail tissue, but a nail-explicit model is missing. Here, we report that nail-less double-ventral digits of ΔLARM1/2 mutants that lack limb-specific Lmx1b enhancers fail to regenerate. To separate the nail’s effect from the lack of dorsoventral (DV) polarity, we also interrogate double-dorsal double-nail digits and show that they regenerate. Thus, DV polarity is not a prerequisite for regeneration, and the nail requirement is supported. Transcriptomic comparison between wild-type and non-regenerative ΔLARM1/2 mutant blastemas reveals differential upregulation of vascularization and connective tissue functional signatures in wild type versus upregulation of inflammation in the mutant. These results, together with the finding of Lmx1b expression in the postnatal dorsal dermis underneath the nail and uniformly in the regenerative blastema, open the possibility of additional Lmx1b roles in digit tip regeneration, in addition to the indirect effect of mediating the formation of the nail.

Abstract: Summary
Chromothripsis is a catastrophic event of chromosomal instability that involves intensive fragmentation and rearrangements within localized chromosomal regions. However, its cause remains unclear. Here, we show that reduction and inactivation of Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) commonly occur in human osteosarcoma, which is associated with a high rate of chromothripsis. In rapidly expanding mouse osteoprogenitors, RanGAP1 deficiency causes chromothripsis in chr1q, instant inactivation of Rb1 and degradation of p53, consequent failure in DNA damage repair, and ultrafast osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. During mitosis, RanGAP1 anchors to the kinetochore, where it recruits PP1-γ to counteract the activity of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) and prevents TOP2A degradation, thus safeguarding chromatid decatenation. Loss of RanGAP1 causes SAC hyperactivation and chromatid decatenation failure. These findings demonstrate that RanGAP1 maintains mitotic chromosome integrity and that RanGAP1 loss drives tumorigenesis through its direct effects on SAC and decatenation and secondary effects on DNA damage surveillance.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as mediators of cellular communication, in part via the delivery of associated microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. We show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mediates the sorting of miR-132-5p, miR-218-5p, and miR-690 in neuron-derived EVs. BDNF-induced EVs in turn increase excitatory synapse formation in recipient hippocampal neurons, which is dependent on the inter-neuronal delivery of these miRNAs. Transcriptomic analysis further indicates the differential expression of developmental and synaptogenesis-related genes by BDNF-induced EVs, many of which are predicted targets of miR-132-5p, miR-218-5p, and miR-690. Furthermore, BDNF-induced EVs up-regulate synaptic vesicle (SV) clustering in a transmissible manner, thereby increasing synaptic transmission and synchronous neuronal activity. As BDNF and EV-miRNAs miR-218 and miR-132 were previously implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, our results contribute to a better understanding of disorders characterized by aberrant neural circuit connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
Sound stimulus is encoded in mice by three molecularly and physiologically diverse subtypes of sensory neurons, called Ia, Ib, and Ic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Here, we show that the transcription factor Runx1 controls SGN subtype composition in the murine cochlea. Runx1 is enriched in Ib/Ic precursors by late embryogenesis. Upon the loss of Runx1 from embryonic SGNs, more SGNs take on Ia rather than Ib or Ic identities. This conversion was more complete for genes linked to neuronal function than to connectivity. Accordingly, synapses in the Ib/Ic location acquired Ia properties. Suprathreshold SGN responses to sound were enhanced in Runx1CKO mice, confirming the expansion of neurons with Ia-like functional properties. Runx1 deletion after birth also redirected Ib/Ic SGNs toward Ia identity, indicating that SGN identities are plastic postnatally. Altogether, these findings show that diverse neuronal identities essential for normal auditory stimulus coding arise hierarchically and remain malleable during postnatal development.

Abstract: Summary
The central circadian regulator within the suprachiasmatic nucleus transmits time of day information by a diurnal spiking rhythm driven by molecular clock genes controlling membrane excitability. Most brain regions, including the hippocampus, harbor similar intrinsic circadian transcriptional machinery, but whether these molecular programs generate oscillations of membrane properties is unclear. Here, we show that intrinsic excitability of mouse dentate granule neurons exhibits a 24-h oscillation that controls spiking probability. Diurnal changes in excitability are mediated by antiphase G-protein regulation of potassium and sodium currents that reduce excitability during the Light phase. Disruption of the circadian transcriptional machinery by conditional deletion of Bmal1 enhances excitability selectively during the Light phase by removing G-protein regulation. These results reveal that circadian transcriptional machinery regulates intrinsic excitability by coordinated regulation of ion channels by G-protein signaling, highlighting a potential novel mechanism of cell-autonomous oscillations.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosine methylation within CG dinucleotides (mCG) can be epigenetically inherited over many generations. Such inheritance is thought to be mediated by a semiconservative mechanism that produces binary present/absent methylation patterns. However, we show here that, in Arabidopsis thaliana h1ddm1 mutants, intermediate heterochromatic mCG is stably inherited across many generations and is quantitatively associated with transposon expression. We develop a mathematical model that estimates the rates of semiconservative maintenance failure and de novo methylation at each transposon, demonstrating that mCG can be stably inherited at any level via a dynamic balance of these activities. We find that DRM2—the core methyltransferase of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway—catalyzes most of the heterochromatic de novo mCG, with de novo rates orders of magnitude higher than previously thought, whereas chromomethylases make smaller contributions. Our results demonstrate that stable epigenetic inheritance of mCG in plant heterochromatin is enabled by extensive de novo methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Substrate degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in specific membrane compartments remains elusive. Here, we show that the interplay of two lipid modifications and PDE6δ regulates compartmental substrate targeting via the SCFFBXL2. FBXL2 is palmitoylated in a prenylation-dependent manner on cysteines 417 and 419 juxtaposed to the CaaX motif. Palmitoylation/depalmitoylation regulates its subcellular trafficking for substrate engagement and degradation. To control its subcellular distribution, lipid-modified FBXL2 interacts with PDE6δ. Perturbing the equilibrium between FBXL2 and PDE6δ disrupts the delivery of FBXL2 to all membrane compartments, whereas depalmitoylated FBXL2 is enriched on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Depalmitoylated FBXL2(C417S/C419S) promotes the degradation of IP3R3 at the ER, inhibits IP3R3-dependent mitochondrial calcium overload, and counteracts calcium-dependent cell death upon oxidative stress. In contrast, disrupting the PDE6δ-FBXL2 equilibrium has the opposite effect. These findings describe a mechanism underlying spatially-restricted substrate degradation and suggest that inhibition of FBXL2 palmitoylation and/or binding to PDE6δ may offer therapeutic benefits.

Abstract: Summary
At the moment of union in fertilization, sperm and oocyte are transcriptionally silent. The ensuing onset of embryonic transcription (embryonic genome activation [EGA]) is critical for development, yet its timing and profile remain elusive in any vertebrate species. We here dissect transcription during EGA by high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing of precisely synchronized mouse one-cell embryos. This reveals a program of embryonic gene expression (immediate EGA [iEGA]) initiating within 4 h of fertilization. Expression during iEGA produces canonically spliced transcripts, occurs substantially from the maternal genome, and is mostly downregulated at the two-cell stage. Transcribed genes predict regulation by transcription factors (TFs) associated with cancer, including c-Myc. Blocking c-Myc or other predicted regulatory TF activities disrupts iEGA and induces acute developmental arrest. These findings illuminate intracellular mechanisms that regulate the onset of mammalian development and hold promise for the study of cancer.

Abstract: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is an efficacious fluoropyrimidine antimetabolite anticancer drug, however, its clinical utility is constrained due to side effect toxicity on delicate organs, including the heart. This study thus aimed at exploring the cardioprotective potentials of naringin (NRG) against 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. We divided Wistar rats into four experimental groups (n = 6) for the administration of NRG (100 mg/kg bw, orally) and/or 5-FU (150 mg/kg bw, intraperitoneal). NRG was administered for 10 days, while 5-FU was injected on the 8th day only. Serum troponin-I (cTn-I) and creatine kinase (CK) were estimated. Cardiac activities/level of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-ĸB (NF-κB) and caspase-3 were determined. 5-FU markedly increased cTn-I, CK, cardiac inflammatory mediators and caspase-3 expressions, whereas antioxidant mediators decreased appreciably when compared to the control groups. Interestingly, the prophylactic administration of NRG prominently inhibited the 5-FU-provoked oxidative stress, pro-inflammation and apoptosis in the heart of rats. Histopathology confirmed the biochemical results of the heart. Therefore, NRG is a potential natural flavonoid for mitigation of 5-FU cardiotoxicity in rats.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive dysfunction is often reported in patients with post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome, but its underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein or its fragments are released from cells during infection, reaching different tissues, including the CNS, irrespective of the presence of the viral RNA. Here, we demonstrate that brain infusion of Spike protein in mice has a late impact on cognitive function, recapitulating post-COVID-19 syndrome. We also show that neuroinflammation and hippocampal microgliosis mediate Spike-induced memory dysfunction via complement-dependent engulfment of synapses. Genetic or pharmacological blockage of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling protects animals against synapse elimination and memory dysfunction induced by Spike brain infusion. Accordingly, in a cohort of 86 patients who recovered from mild COVID-19, the genotype GG TLR4-2604G>A (rs10759931) is associated with poor cognitive outcome. These results identify TLR4 as a key target to investigate the long-term cognitive dysfunction after COVID-19 infection in humans and rodents.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) is driven by mutations that mediate escape from neutralizing antibodies. There is also evidence that mutations can cause loss of T cell epitopes. However, studies on viral escape from T cell immunity have been hampered by uncertain estimates of epitope prevalence. Here, we map and quantify CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2-specific minimal epitopes in blood drawn from April to June 2020 from 83 COVID-19 convalescents. Among 37 HLA ligands eluted from five prevalent alleles and an additional 86 predicted binders, we identify 29 epitopes with an immunoprevalence ranging from 3% to 100% among individuals expressing the relevant HLA allele. Mutations in VOC are reported in 10.3% of the epitopes, while 20.6% of the non-immunogenic peptides are mutated in VOC. The nine most prevalent epitopes are conserved in VOC. Thus, comprehensive mapping of epitope prevalence does not provide evidence that mutations in VOC are driven by escape of T cell immunity.

Abstract: Testicular dysfunction and infertility are serious complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). L-Arginine (L-Arg) is a semi essential amino acid with various biological and metabolic functions. The molecular mechanisms of L-Arg on testicular dysfunction caused by DM remain elusive. This study aimed to assess the potential protective effect of L-Arg in diabetic testis and its possible mechanisms. 24 adult male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups: CON, L-Arg that received 1 g/kg body weight of L-Arg orally for 4 weeks, DM that fed a high fat diet followed by an injection of 30 mg/kg streptozotocin intraperitoneally, and L-Arg-treated DM that were diabetic and administered L-Arg. DM decreased relative testicular weight, reduced serum testosterone, and impaired semen parameters. Reduced total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), in addition to increased transforming growth factor B1 (TGF-β1) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, were found in the testicular tissue. This was associated with severe degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules and interstitial cells of Leydig, reduction of Johnsen's score, significantly increased expression of both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and caspase-3, and reduced zonula occludens (ZO)− 1 expression. Ultrastructurally, disrupted intercellular junctions and degeneration of interstitial cells of Leydig were observed. In contrast, treatment of diabetic animals with L-Arg increased TAC, SOD and GSH-Px, decreased TGF-β1 and NO levels, downregulated iNOS and caspase-3 expression, upregulated ZO-1 expression, and maintained the integrity of the Sertoli cell junctions. Hence, L-Arg restored the normal testicular structure and function via its antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic effects.

Abstract: Summary
Cell plasticity and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate and lung adenocarcinomas are one of the major reasons for therapeutic resistance to targeted therapy. Whether and how metabolic changes contribute to this adenocarcinoma-to-neuroendocrine cell fate transition remains largely unclear. Here we show that neuroendocrine prostate or lung cancer cells possess mostly fragmented mitochondria with low membrane potential and rely on glycolysis for energy metabolism. We further show an important role of the cell fate determinant Numb in mitochondrial quality control via binding to Parkin and facilitating Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Deficiency in the Numb/Parkin pathway in prostate or lung adenocarcinomas causes a metabolic reprogramming featured with a significant increase in production of lactate acid, which subsequently leads to an upregulation of histone lactylation and transcription of neuroendocrine-associated genes. Collectively, the Numb/Parkin-directed mitochondrial fitness is a key metabolic switch and a promising therapeutic target on cancer cell plasticity through the regulation of histone lactylation.

Abstract: Summary
The danger signals that activate the related nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) and caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing 8 (CARD8) inflammasomes have not been fully established. We recently reported that the oxidized form of TRX1 binds to NLRP1 and represses inflammasome activation. These findings suggested that intracellular reductive stress, which would reduce oxidized TRX1 and thereby abrogate the NLRP1-TRX1 interaction, is an NLRP1 inflammasome-activating danger signal. However, no agents that induce reductive stress were known to test this premise. Here, we identify and characterize several radical-trapping antioxidants, including JSH-23, that induce reductive stress. We show that these compounds accelerate the proteasome-mediated degradation of the repressive N-terminal fragments of both NLRP1 and CARD8, releasing the inflammasome-forming C-terminal fragments from autoinhibition. Overall, this work validates chemical probes that induce reductive stress and establishes reductive stress as a danger signal sensed by both the NLRP1 and CARD8 inflammasomes.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cells (ECs) line blood vessels and serve as a niche for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Recent data point to tissue-specific EC specialization as well as heterogeneity; however, it remains unclear how ECs acquire these properties. Here, by combining live-imaging-based lineage-tracing and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish embryos, we identify an unexpected origin for part of the vascular HSPC niche. We find that islet1 (isl1)-expressing cells are the progenitors of the venous ECs that constitute the majority of the HSPC niche. These isl1-expressing cells surprisingly originate from the endoderm and differentiate into ECs in a process dependent on Bmp-Smad signaling and subsequently requiring npas4l (cloche) function. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses show that isl1-derived ECs express a set of genes that reflect their distinct origin. This study demonstrates that endothelial specialization in the HSPC niche is determined at least in part by the origin of the ECs.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory neurons in the neocortex exhibit distinct functional selectivity to constitute the neural map. While neocortical map of the visual cortex in higher mammals is clustered, it displays a striking “salt-and-pepper” pattern in rodents. However, little is known about the origin and basis of the interspersed neocortical map. Here we report that the intricate excitatory neuronal kinship-dependent synaptic connectivity influences precise functional map organization in the mouse primary visual cortex. While sister neurons originating from the same neurogenic radial glial progenitors (RGPs) preferentially develop synapses, cousin neurons derived from amplifying RGPs selectively antagonize horizontal synapse formation. Accordantly, cousin neurons in similar layers exhibit clear functional selectivity differences, contributing to a salt-and-pepper architecture. Removal of clustered protocadherins (cPCDHs), the largest subgroup of the diverse cadherin superfamily, eliminates functional selectivity differences between cousin neurons and alters neocortical map organization. These results suggest that developmental neuronal origin regulates neocortical map formation via cPCDHs.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer (CRC) are poorly understood, hindering patient treatment. In the current study, we investigate whether events occurring at the invasion front are of particular importance for CRC treatment strategies. To this end, we analyze CRC tissues by combining spatial transcriptomics from patients with a public single-cell transcriptomic atlas to determine cell-cell interactions at the invasion front. We show that CRC cells are localized specifically at the invasion front. These cells induce human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) to produce secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)+ macrophages while conferring CRC cells with anti-tumor immunity, as well as proliferative and invasive properties. Taken together, these findings highlight the signaling between CRC cell populations and stromal cell populations at the cellular level.

Abstract: Summary
The protection of DNA replication forks under stress is essential for genome maintenance and cancer suppression. One mechanism of fork protection involves an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which in turn activates CaMKK2 and AMPK to prevent uncontrolled fork processing by Exo1. How replication stress triggers [Ca2+]i elevation is unclear. Here, we report a role of cytosolic self-DNA (cytosDNA) and the ion channel TRPV2 in [Ca2+]i induction and fork protection. Replication stress leads to the generation of ssDNA and dsDNA species that, upon translocation into cytoplasm, trigger the activation of the sensor protein cGAS and the production of cGAMP. The subsequent binding of cGAMP to STING causes its dissociation from TRPV2, leading to TRPV2 derepression and Ca2+ release from the ER, which in turn activates the downstream signaling cascade to prevent fork degradation. This Ca2+-dependent genome protection pathway is also activated in response to replication stress caused by oncogene activation.
