Abstract: Background
Decreased spleen and liver volumes and increased hemoglobin levels and platelet counts usually occur with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in symptomatic patients with Gaucher disease. Because of decreased supply of imiglucerase, an FDA-approved Early Access Program (EAP) allowed use of a new, pre-licensed ERT, velaglucerase alfa. This report provides safety and efficacy findings in patients on EAP velaglucerase alfa who completed 6, 9, or 12months as intravenous every-other-week ERT.
Method
EAP was approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health. All patients enrolled in the EAP were included for safety measures; only those with >6month evaluations of hemoglobin, platelet counts, and liver and spleen volumes were included for efficacy. Descriptive statistics were employed.
Results
Among 71 EAP patients, there were no drug-related serious adverse events or withdrawals; one patient (1.4%) with previous hypersensitivity to a different ERT had a drug-related allergic reaction. Of 44 patients with appropriate time-period evaluations, 8 patients were treatment-naïve and responded well to velaglucerase alfa. The 36 switch-over patients remained at imiglucerase low-doses; a majority of patients showed improvements in each efficacy parameter.
Conclusion
Switch-over from imiglucerase (10–224months) was safe and in several patients velaglucerase alfa induced a booster-effect.

Abstract: Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug demonstrated to possess a tremendous anticancer potential. As progression of some tumors is influenced by sex hormones, we investigated if the antineoplastic action of aspirin shows gender dependence. Using a murine model of T-cell lymphoma, the present investigation was undertaken to study if the antitumor actions of aspirin against lymphoma cells display gender dimorphism. The findings of the present investigation indicate that aspirin administration to male and female tumor-bearing hosts resulted in gender dependent differential tumor growth retardation. Such gender dichotomy of aspirin's antitumor action was associated with a differential impact on cell cycle progression and expression of cell survival regulatory molecules. Aspirin administration was also found to modulate crucial parameters of tumor microenvironment, including contents of glucose, lactate and cell growth regulatory cytokines, in a gender specific manner. Aspirin was found to reverse estrogen-dependent augmentation of tumor cell survival in vitro. Taken together the results of the present study suggest that the antineoplastic action of aspirin is gender-dependent and should be considered in designing of gender-specific therapeutic applications of aspirin.

Abstract: Ubiquitylation is a widespread post-translational global regulatory system that is essential for the proper functioning of various cellular events. Recent studies have shown that certain types of Escherichia coli can exploit specific aspects of the ubiquitylation system to influence downstream targets. Despite these findings, examination of the effects pathogenic E. coli have on the overall host ubiquitylation system remain unexplored. To study the impact that pathogenic E. coli have on the ubiquitylation levels of host proteins during infections, we analyzed the entire ubiquitylation system during enteropathogenic E. coli infections of cultured cells. We found that these microbes caused a dramatic decrease in ubiquitylated host proteins during these infections. This occurred with a concomitant reduction in the expression of essential E1 activating enzymes in the host, which are integral for the initiation of the ubiquitylation cascade. Control of host E1 enzyme levels was dependent on the E. coli adherence factor plasmid which acted on host aspartyl proteases within enteropathogenic E. coli. Hijacking of the ubiquitylation system did not require the plasmid-encoded regulator or bundle forming pilus expression, as enteropathogenic E. coli mutated in those factors did not revert the ubiquitylation of host proteins or the abundance of E1 enzyme proteins to uninfected levels. Our work shows that E. coli have developed strategies to usurp post-translational systems by targeting crucial enzymes. The ability of enteropathogenic E. coli to inactivate host protein ubiquitylation could enable more efficient effector protein functionality, providing increased bacterial control of host cells during enteropathogenic E. coli pathogenesis.

Abstract: During metastasis, cancer cells breach the basement membrane and migrate through the stroma mostly composed of a network of collagen I fibers. Cell migration on 2D is initiated by protrusion of the cell membrane followed by formation of adhesions that link the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Cells then move forwards by exerting traction forces on the adhesions at its front and by disassembling adhesions at the rear. In 2D, only the ventral surface of a migrating cell is in contact with the ECM, where cell–matrix adhesions are assembled. In 3D matrices, even though the whole surface of a migrating cell is available for interacting with the ECM, it is unclear whether discrete adhesion structures actually exist. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy we imaged the endogenous adhesome proteins in three different cancer cell types embedded in non-pepsinized collagen type I, polymerized at a slow rate, to allow the formation of a network that resembles the organization of EMC observed in vivo. Vinculin aggregates were detected in the cellular protrusions, frequently colocalizing with collagen fibers, implying they correspond to adhesion structures in 3D. As the distance from the substrate bottom increases, adhesion aggregates become smaller and almost undetectable in some cell lines. Using intravital imaging we show here, for the first time, the existence of adhesome proteins aggregates in vivo. These aggregates share similarities with the ones found in 3D collagen matrices. It still remains to be determined if adhesions assembled in 3D and in vivo share functional similarities to the well-described adhesions in 2D. This will provide a major step forward in understanding cell migration in more physiological environments.

Abstract: Hepcidin, an iron regulatory peptide, plays a central role in the maintenance of systemic iron homeostasis by inducing the internalization and degradation of the iron exporter, ferroportin. Hepcidin expression in the liver is regulated in response to several stimuli including iron status, erythropoietic activity, hypoxia and inflammation. Hepcidin expression has been shown to be reduced in phenylhydrazine-treated mice, a mouse model of acute hemolysis. In this mouse model, hepcidin suppression was associated with increased expression of molecules involved in iron transport and recycling. The present study aims to explore whether the response to phenylhydrazine treatment is affected by hepcidin deficiency and/or the subsequently altered iron metabolism. Hepcidin1 knockout (Hamp−/−) and wild type mice were treated with phenylhydrazine or saline and parameters of iron homeostasis were determined 3days after the treatment. In wild type mice, phenylhydrazine administration resulted in significantly reduced serum iron, increased tissue non-heme iron levels and suppressed hepcidin expression. The treatment was also associated with increases in membrane ferroportin protein levels and spleen heme oxygenase 1 mRNA expression. In addition, trends toward increased mRNA expression of duodenal iron transporters were also observed. In contrast, serum iron and tissue non-heme iron levels in Hamp−/− mice were unaffected by the treatment. Moreover, the effects of phenylhydrazine on the expression of ferroportin and duodenal iron transporters were not observed in Hamp−/− mice. Interestingly, mRNA levels of molecules involved in splenic heme uptake and degradation were significantly induced by Hamp disruption. In summary, our study demonstrates that the response to phenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis differs between wild type and Hamp−/− mice. This observation may be caused by the absence of hepcidin per se or the altered iron homeostasis induced by the lack of hepcidin in these mice.

Abstract: The feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1 (FLVCR1) is a heme exporter that maintains the intracellular heme concentration. FLVCR1 was previously assumed to be involved in Diamond–Blackfan anemia, and it was recently reported that mutations in the FLVCR1 gene are found in patients with posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Four mutations in FLVCR1 (Asn121Asp, Cys192Arg, Ala241Thr, and Gly493Arg) are located within putative transmembrane domains; however, the effects of FLVCR1 mutations on PCARP are unclear. In this study, we analyzed the function of FLVCR1 mutants by using a fluorescent heme analog as a transporter substrate, and found that all 4 FLVCR1 mutants lost their heme export activity. To investigate the mechanism responsible for this loss of activity, we determined the subcellular localization of FLVCR1 mutants. FLVCR1 mutants did not localize to the plasma membrane and were observed in intracellular structures, including lysosomes. We hypothesize that the loss of function of FLVCR1 mutants is caused by their mislocation. We examined the half-life of FLVCR1 in cells, which was >16h for wild-type FLVCR1 compared with 2–4h for the mutants. Based on these results, we propose that FLVCR1 mutants failed to fold properly in the ER, were rapidly degraded in the lysosomes, and therefore, could not export heme out of cells. Thus, accumulation of heme in FLVCR1-mutant cells could cause cellular toxicity.

Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection may contribute to many extragastric diseases including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the exact mechanism by which H. pylori induces the liver damage is largely unknown. We used cultured mouse primary hepatocytes as an in vitro model to investigate different aspects of liver physiology and pathology. In this study, we show that primary hepatocytes are able to assemble actin-based cytoskeletal structures called podosomes at the ventral plasma membrane. These structures are positive for podosome markers such as cortactin, vinculin and integrins and comprise proteolytic potential. Infection with the pathogen H. pylori further stimulates the formation of podosomes in primary hepatocytes. The use of pharmacological inhibitors reveals that this response is mediated, at least in part, by TGFβ, a cytokine known to regulate podosome formation in endothelial cells. Similar results are obtained with the hepatoma cell line Huh7. Podosome formation is associated with increased hepatocyte degrading capacities but also with reduced cell motility. Therefore, podosome assembly translates into hepatocyte malfunction. Our study supports the hypothesis that hepatocytes can also assemble podosomes under pathological conditions in vivo.

Abstract: HOXA9 plays a critical role in both normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, particularly in the development and maintenance of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia. Through reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of HOXA9 transcripts in human leukemia and normal bone marrow samples, we identified a truncated isoform of HOXA9, namely HOXA9T, and found that both HOXA9T and canonical HOXA9 were highly expressed in leukemia cell lines bearing MLL rearrangements, relative to human normal bone marrow cells or other subtypes of leukemia cells. A frameshift in HOXA9T in exon I causes a premature stop codon upstream of the PBX‐binding domain and the homeodomain, which leads to the generation of a non-homeodomain-containing protein. Unlike the canonical HOXA9, HOXA9T alone cannot transform normal bone marrow progenitor cells. Moreover, HOXA9T cannot cooperate with MEIS1 to transform cells, despite the presence of a MEIS1-binding domain. Remarkably, although the truncated isoforms of many proteins function as dominant-negative competitors or inhibitors of their full-length counterparts, this is not the case for HOXA9T; instead, HOXA9T synergized with HOXA9 in transforming mouse normal bone marrow progenitor cells through promoting self-renewal and proliferation of the cells. Collectively, our data indicate that both truncated and full-length forms of HOXA9 are highly expressed in human MLL-rearranged leukemia, and the truncated isoform of HOXA9 might also play an oncogenic role by cooperating with canonical HOXA9 in cell transformation and leukemogenesis.

Abstract: Development of efficient thermal energy storage (TES) technology is key to successful utilisation of solar energy for high temperature (>420°C) applications. Phase change materials (PCMs) have been identified as having advantages over sensible heat storage media. An important component of TES development is therefore selection of PCM media. Given the huge and growing number of new materials currently available today (>160,000) finding a suitable material is a complicated and time consuming process. This paper demonstrates the use of a materials selection software based on a multi-objective optimisation methodology to identify potential PCM media for TES. In addition an environmental audit function of the software is used to evaluate the environmental credentials of PCMs—in an analyses not previously reported in the literature. Metals such as Al, Mg, Si and Zn and their eutectics 88Al–12Si and 60Al–34Mg–6Zn were found to be highly suitable as PCMs for the duty considered (steam from 400–750°C). Their properties, heat of fusion, thermal conductivity, etc. have advantages over traditional molten salts—with 88Al–12Si showing the best environmental performance as well. The heat transfer effectiveness of this alloy was also evaluated by the ε-NTU method and favourably compared to a HiTech salt using a heat exchanger geometry.

Abstract: Study on the phenotypic expression of hemoglobin (Hb) A2 and Hb E in Hb E disorders has been difficult due to the co-separation of Hb A2 and Hb E in most Hb analysis assays. Because these two Hbs are separated on capillary electrophoresis, we studied phenotypic expression of Hbs A2, E and F in various Hb E disorders using this system. This was done on 362 subjects with several Hb E disorders including heterozygous Hb E, homozygous Hb E, β-thalassemia/Hb E, δβ-thalassemia/Hb E, and Hb Lepore/Hb E and those of these disorders with several forms of α-thalassemia. Normal controls showed Hb A2 of 2.7±0.3%. Heterozygous Hb E and homozygous Hb E had elevated Hb A2 i.e. 3.8±0.3% and 4.8±0.5%, respectively. Further elevations were observed for β0-thalassemia/Hb E (6.1±1.9%) and β+-thalassemia/Hb E (7.1±1.2%). Interestingly, no elevation of Hb A2 was found in the δβ-thalassemia/Hb E, and Hb Lepore/Hb E (2.3±0.3%) but higher Hb F levels were noted which could be useful diagnostic markers. The levels of Hb E were variable. Co-inheritance of these Hb E disorders with α-thalassemia were associated with lower outputs of Hb E and Hb F but the levels of Hb A2 were not altered. Different phenotypic expression of Hb A2, Hb E and Hb F could help in differential diagnosis of these Hb E related disorders commonly encountered in the regions where access to molecular techniques is limited.

Abstract: The ectopic expression in peripheral blood cells of the brain-type creatine kinase (CKB) is an autosomal dominant inherited anomaly named CKBE (MIM ID 123270). Here, we characterized the CK activity in serum, platelets (PLT) and leukocytes (WBC) of 22 probands (from 8 unrelated families) and 10 controls. CK activity was measured by standard UV-photometry. Expression of the CKB gene was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. DNA sequencing including bisulfite treatment was used for molecular analysis of the CKB gene. Serum CK levels were comparable between probands and controls. CKBE probands revealed significantly higher CK activity in PLT (3.7±2.7 versus 179.2±83.0 U/1012 PLT; p<0.001) and WBC (0.4±0.3 versus 2.6±2.1 U/109 WBC; p=0.004). Inhibitory anti-CKM antibodies did not affect CK activity indicating that the CK activity is generated exclusively by the CK-BB isoenzyme. CKB mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in PLT and WBC from probands compared to controls. Re-sequencing of the entire CKB gene and methylation analysis of a CpG island revealed no alteration in CKBE probands. The genetic basis of CKBE remains unclear, however, we propose that a de-methylated CKB gene is inherited that leads to high CKB expression levels in myeloic precursor cells in the bone marrow.

Abstract: Ancient DNA methodologies can be applied in the investigation of the genetics of extinct populations. A search for beta thalassemia mutations was performed on 49 Minoan individuals from the Bronze Age who were living in the island of Crete approximately 4000Years Before Present (YBP). Standard precautionary measures were employed in the laboratory to ensure authenticity of the DNA extracted from the ancient bones, resulting in the successful analysis of DNA of 24 Minoans. DNA sequencing focused on the Intervening Sequence 1 (IVS-1) of the beta globin gene and its splicing junctions. 63% of the thalassemia mutations observed among modern Cretans reside in beta IVS-1. None of the Minoan individuals carried one of the IVS-1 mutations known to cause beta thalassemia; however, only one was expected to be observed if the average frequency of beta thalassemia heterozygotes in the Minoan population was the same with that of modern day Cretans (7.6%). One individual contained a C to G substitution in position 91 of the IVS-1, located 40bp 5′ to the intron 1/exon 2 junction. Functional studies indicated that the mutation did not affect mRNA splicing or stability, and most likely represented an innocent single nucleotide polymorphism.

Abstract: Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) act as trophic factors during development and regeneration of the nervous system. FGFs mediate their responses by activation of four types of FGF receptors (FGFR1–4). FGFR1 is expressed in adult sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and overexpression of FGFR1 enhances FGF-2-induced elongative axon growth in vitro. Ligand-induced activation of FGFR1 is followed by endocytosis and rapid lysosomal degradation. We previously reported that the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin prevents degradation of FGFR1 and promotes FGF-2-induced elongative axon growth of DRG neurons overexpressing FGFR1. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of leupeptin on intracellular sorting of FGFR1 in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and DRG neurons. Leupeptin increased colocalization of FGFR1 with lysosomes. Furthermore, leupeptin enhanced the cell surface localization of FGFR1 by increased receptor recycling and this effect was abolished by the recycling inhibitor monensin. In addition, a lysine mutant of FGFR1, which is preferentially recycled back to the cell surface, promoted elongative axon growth of DRG neurons similar to leupeptin. In contrast, the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin had no effect on surface localization of FGFR1, inhibited axon growth of DRG neurons and abolished the effects of leupeptin on receptor recycling. Together, our results strongly imply that increased recycling of FGFR1 promotes axon elongation, but not axonal branching, of adult DRG neurons in vitro.

Abstract: In humans, acute erythroid expansion can lead to maturation of red blood cell (RBC) precursors containing fetal hemoglobin (F red cells). This can occur in patients after recovery from bone marrow transplantation, or in individuals affected by sickle cell or thalassemic syndromes. An accelerated erythroid lineage expansion is also a hallmark of the adaptive response to high altitude hypoxia. To explore the possible effect of this environment on F red cell production, we analyzed RBCs from five subjects during and after 17days spent at high altitude and investigated the expression of fetal hemoglobin by different methodological approaches. By flow cytometry, we found a moderate increase of circulating F red cells during and after the hypoxia exposure, with respect to control cells analyzed before a stay at high altitude. The increased expression of γ-globin (as the specific subunit contained in F hemoglobin together with α-globin) was further confirmed by immunoblotting of young RBC hemolysates and quantitative RT-PCR of transcripts purified from a reticulocyte-enriched RBC fraction. Thus, in healthy adults the exposure to high altitude hypoxia induces maturation of F red cells at a level higher than under normal condition. The effect appears reduced after return to normoxia.

Abstract: GluR5-containing kainite receptor (GluR5–KAR) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of nervous system diseases, while S-nitrosylation exerts a variety of effects on biological systems. However, the mechanism of GluR5–KAR S-nitrosylation is still unclear up to now. Here our researches found that GluR5–KAR selective agonist ATPA stimulation activated the nonclassical GluR5–KAR–Gq–PLC–IP3R pathway and the signalling module GluR5·PSD-95·nNOS (the former is more important), led to Ca2+ release from intracellular calcium stores endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cytoplasm and extracellular calcium indrawal, respectively, which further resulted in nNOS activation and GluR5–KAR S-nitrosylation, and then inhibited GluR5-mediated whole-cell current attenuation and induced apoptosis in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Clarification of the primary mechanisms of GluR5–KAR S-nitrosylation induced by ATPA and identification of critical cysteine for GluR5-2a S-nitrosylation (Cys231 and Cys804) open up a brand-new field for revealing downstream signalling pathway of GluR5–KAR and its molecular characteristics, exploring the pathogenesis of neurological diseases and searching for promising therapies.

We found that BMP-7 at a concentration of 25ng/ml induces signalling exclusively via ALK2 and ALK3 leading to the activation of Smad1 and Smad5 and subsequent expression of Id proteins. In contrast, low doses of TGF-β1 (0.1ng/ml) lead to an exclusive activation of ALK5 and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 that regulate specific target genes including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). CTGF is rapidly induced by TGF-β1 already 1h after stimulation and reduced by BMP-7 application. Smad1/Smad5 or Id1/2 overexpression reduced the TGF-β1-mediated expression of CTGF. However, although siRNA-mediated knock down of Alk2/3 or Smad1/5 counteracts the BMP-7 effect on basal CTGF expression there was no consistent reversion of the observed BMP-7 effect on TGF-β1-mediated CTGF expression. Moreover, ALK5 inhibition using the SB431542 inhibitor significantly affected CTGF expression only at later time points whereas ERK1/2 inhibition completely abrogated CTGF expression. These findings point towards a regulatory role of BMP-7 that relies on modulation of Mitogen-activated protein kinases rather than mechanisms that are exclusively driven by differential Smad activation.

Abstract: Calcineurin is an important signalling protein in a plethora of Ca2+-regulated cellular processes. In contrast to what is known about the function of calcineurin in various organisms, information on calcineurin substrates is still limited. Here we describe the identification and characterisation of the transcription factor activated by calcineurin (TacA) in the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum. TacA is a putative zinc-finger transcription factor orthologue of yeast Crz1. In resting unstimulated cells the protein is located in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus in a calcineurin-dependent manner after Ca2+-stimulation. Nuclear export of TacA is partially dependent on GskA, the Dictyostelium orthologue of mammalian GSK3. The expression of tacA is developmentally regulated with its kinetics roughly paralleling calcineurin regulation. Silencing of tacA via RNAi leads to developmental defects and dysregulation of developmentally regulated and Ca2+-regulated marker genes. Additionally, TacA is involved in the stress response of D. discoideum during development in a separate pathway to the well-known stress response in Dictyostelium via STATc. Finally we provide evidence that TacA is not only an orthologue of yeast Crz1 but also functionally related to mammalian NFAT.

Abstract: The present investigation studied the effect of aspirin administration in tumor-bearing hosts on bone marrow cellularity and myelopoiesis. Aspirin administration to mice bearing a transplantable T-cell lymphoma, designated as Dalton's lymphoma (DL), augmented proliferation of bone marrow cells (BMC). BMC of aspirin-administered tumor-bearing mice were found to be predominantly in the S phase of cell cycle releasing them from G0/G1 arrest. Aspirin-exposed BMC also showed an altered expression of survival and cell cycle regulatory proteins p53, bcl2, caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD), cyclin B1 and cyclin D. Moreover, the BMC of aspirin-administered tumor-bearing mice showed an augmented colony-forming ability and differentiation in the macrophage lineage with an activated phenotype of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with respect to macrophage-mediated tumoricidal activity and production of nitric oxide, IL-1β, TNFα and VEGF. On the other hand aspirin administration to normal mice showed little effect on bone marrow cellularity and myeloid differentiation. In this model, aspirin had a myelopoetic action in tumor-bearing host.

Abstract: Background
Earlier results highlighted hyperferritinemia during type-1 Gaucher disease (GD), but its potential mechanisms and long-term progression remained unexamined.
Methods
We analyzed the clinical, biological and iron characteristics of type-1 GD patients, before and after starting enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT). Iron parameters under ERT were subjected to linear-regression analyses.
Results
Serum ferritin (median 739 [46–2371] μg/L) was determined for 54 patients (21 (39%) males; median age 32 [range 12–73] years) before ERT; it exceeded 300μg/L in 47 (87%), while the other iron parameters always remained normal: transferrin saturation coefficient (26 [16–42]), serum iron at 13 [6–22] mmol/L and transferrin at 2.4 [2,3] g/L. Four patients had mild elevation of liver transaminases, with C-reactive protein >20mg/l in two. The absence of hemolysis was accompanied by a median bilirubin of 9μmol/L and lactate dehydrogenase at 250IU/L; diabetes and lipid anomalies were not observed. Clinical, biological and iron parameters at GD diagnosis were comparable for the 12 and 42 patients with ferritinemia ≤400 and >400μg/L, respectively. Ferritinemia was measured at least once for 46 patients after ERT onset (median treatment duration 90 [3–204] months). At study closure, median serum ferritin was 187.5 [11–1560] μg/L, exceeding 300μg/L in 15 (33%) patients, while the other iron parameters were normal. Among the latter, only the mean±SD ferritinemia slope decreased significantly under ERT (−1.9±0.3%/month; p<0.001).
Conclusion
Hyperferritinemia is a specific GD characteristic and serum ferritin monitoring could be informative during follow-up.

Abstract: The maturation from reticulocyte (immature red blood cell) to erythrocyte (mature red blood cell) includes the loss or decreased expression of cell surface molecules through exosome formation and secretion. Identifying the molecules lost and the molecular events involved is important to our understanding of this final stage of erythropoiesis and of diseases where it is deranged. Also, the presence of certain cell surface molecules is likely responsible for the invasion of certain malaria parasites into reticulocytes. Using a global proteomics approach, we identified proteins potentially lost during and/or involved in the reticulocyte maturation process. The reticulocyte proteome has not yet been published, as previous such studies have focused on the mature erythrocyte. Membrane-rich fractions were fractionated by electrophoresis followed by analysis with tandem mass spectrometry. Seven hundred forty four proteins were identified in the reticulocyte-rich membrane fraction, 192 proteins in the erythrocyte-rich membrane fraction, with 157 common to both fractions. Many of the proteins found uniquely in the reticulocyte were associated with structures known to be in reticulocytes (mitochondria, Golgi). Additional proteins detected are or may be specifically involved in vesicle trafficking, a process important in the maturation process. A number of unique plasma membrane proteins were also identified. These results provide the groundwork for future targeted studies to improve our understanding of the mechanism of reticulocyte maturation and the role of reticulocytes in disease.

Abstract: We report on an optimization study of recombination layers in inverted tandem bulk heterojunction polymeric solar cells. Modification of bilayers of MoOx/Ag with a polymeric surface modifier, polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE), is found to significantly improve the performance of these recombination layers. The improvement is assigned to a significant reduction by 1.5eV of the work function of the Ag with PEIE. An analysis of the electrical, optical, and surface properties of the recombination trilayer is presented. Inverted tandem polymer solar cells, fabricated with two identical active layers comprising a donor polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a fullerene derivative acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM), provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of the effectiveness of the MoOx/Ag/PEIE trilayer as recombination layer. Such tandem cells yield an open-circuit voltage of 1042mV and fill factors of 0.62, comparable to those of single cells (0.63) under simulated AM 1.5G, 100mW/cm2 illumination. Preliminary shelf lifetime studies suggest that these trilayer recombination layers show good air stability.

Abstract: An innovative tunable photovoltaic electrochromic (PV–EC) device concept, in which planar distribution of silicon thin film solar cells (Si-TFSCs) structure with successively deposited electrochromic thin films (ECTFs) and electrolyte layer is demonstrated. The switching mechanism of a PV–EC device is realized by electrically separating the electrodes of the Si-TFSCs and ECTFs, and the connection of the two systems is achieved through an external switching apparatus that links each Si-TFSC and ECTF through one transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer. According to the PV–EC device structure, Si-TFSCs arranged in stripes makes large area module fabrication feasible, while Si-TFSCs arranged in arrays allows pixel structure design possible. When illuminated by sunlight under short-circuit condition, the photopotential outputted from a single Si-TFSC drives ECTF layer to change color, simultaneously a portion of the photocurrent is stored in a capacitor. Once the ECTF is tinted, no power is needed to retain its colored state due to the bi-stable property of the electrochromic material. In order to revert the PV–EC device to its bleached state, the capacitor supplies reverse potential to cause discoloration of the ECTF. In addition, the monolithically integrated Si-TFSC module generates electricity to a connected load. In view of photoelectric conversion and optical modulation properties, the PV–EC device can both function as a Si-TFSC module and as a self powered smart glass, which has great advantages in green energy application.

Abstract: Metallic nanoparticles are attractive candidates as MRI contrast agents and mediators for drug delivery, diagnostics, and therapy. Direct contact and exposure to blood circulation is common in many such applications. The consequent thrombotic response may therefore be important to study. The main objective of the present work was to study how platelet functions were changed in the presence of different nano-surface or surface capping, which may provide a measure for the safety of a nanoparticle, and also assess the use of such nanoparticles in platelet modulation. Aggregometry, ATP release reaction, flow cytometry and immune-blotting studies were performed to study platelet response to different nano-particles (iron oxide, gold and silver). For each nanoparticle surface conjugation (capping) was varied. It was found that citric acid functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles have anti-platelet activity, with a decrease in aggregation, tyrosine phosphorylation level, and granule release. On the other hand in other cases (e.g. gold nanoparticles) pro-aggregatory response was observed in the presence of nanoparticles and, in some cases, the nanoparticles behaved neutrally (e.g. for starch-coated iron oxide nanoparticles). Therefore, nanoparticles can induce antiplatelet or a pro-aggregatory response, or remain neutral depending on surface capping. A related observation is that antiplatelet drugs can be made more potent by nanoparticle conjugation.

Abstract: More than 90% of Fanconi anemia (FA) patients experience progressive bone marrow failure during life with a median onset at 8years of age. As matched sibling donor transplantation as preferred treatment is not available for the majority of patients, several synthetic androgens have been used as short-term treatment options for the marrow failure in FA patients for more than 50years. Here, we retrospectively collected data on eight FA patients who received danazol for the off-label treatment of their marrow failure at a starting dose of approximately 5mg/kg body weight/die. The hematological parameters at the initiation of treatment were hemoglobin (Hb) <8g/dL and/or thrombocytes <30,000/μl. In 7 out of 8 FA patients, the values for both parameters rose on average >50% over the starting counts within 6months and remained stable for up to 3years despite careful reduction of the danazol dose per kg body weight. In 4 patients with a follow-up of 3years, the platelets finally reached an average of 68,000/μL or 2.8 times over the starting values, while the Hb remained stable >11g/dL. Danazol was reduced to 54% of the starting dose or 2.6mg/kg/die. One FA-A patient with an unusually severe phenotype did not response with her PB counts to either danazol or oxymethalone within 6months. None of the patients developed severe or unacceptable side-effects from the danazol treatment that led to the discontinuation of therapy. This initial description suggests that danazol might be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for delaying the progressive marrow failure in FA patients for at least 3years and longer.

Polarised apical-like intracellular sorting and trafficking regulates invadopodia formation and degradation of the extracellular matrix in cancer cells,

Abstract: Invadopodia are proteolytically active protrusions formed by invasive tumoral cells when grown on an extracellular matrix (ECM) substratum. A current challenge is to understand how proteolytic activity is so precisely localised at discrete sites of the plasma membrane to produce focalised ECM degradation at invadopodia. Indeed, a number of components including metalloproteases need to be directed to invadopodia to ensure proper segregation of proteolytic activities. We recently found invadopodia to feature the properties of cholesterol-rich membrane domains (a.k.a. lipid drafts) and that ECM degradation depends on the tight control of cholesterol homeostasis. Since apically directed polarised sorting and transport in epithelial cells relies on segregation of proteins into lipid rafts at the Golgi complex, we hypothesised that invadopodia-dependent ECM degradation might also rely on lipid raft-dependent polarised transport routes. To investigate this issue we undertook a three-pronged approach. First, we found that microtubule depolymerisation, which is known to disrupt polarised transport in polarised cells, strongly inhibited invadopodia formation, while not affecting overall protein transport. In the second approach we found that glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored green fluorescent protein (an apical model protein), but not vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein or influenza virus hemagglutinin (both model basolateral model cargoes), was transported to sites of ECM degradation. Finally, RNAi-mediated knock-down of proteins known to specifically regulate polarised apical or basolateral transport in epithelial cells, such as caveolin 1 and annexin XIIIB or clathrin, respectively, demonstrated that the selective inhibition of the apical, but not the basolateral, transport route impairs invadopodia formation and ECM degradation. Taken together, our findings suggest that invadopodia are apical-like membrane domains, where signal transduction and local membrane remodelling events might be temporally and spatially confined via selective raft-dependent apical transport routes.

Abstract: The extracellular environment through which neural crest cells (NCCs) translocate and differentiate plays a crucial role in the determination of cell migration and homing. In the trunk, NCC-derived melanocyte precursor cells (MPCs) take the dorsolateral pathway and colonize the skin, where they differentiate into pigment cells (PCs). Our hypothesis was that the skin, the MPCs’ target tissue, may induce a directional response of NCCs toward diffusible factor(s). We show that the treatment of in vitro NCCs with skin extract (SE) or Stem Cell Factor (SCF) contributes to maintaining proliferative activity, accelerates melanocyte differentiation, and guides a subpopulation of NCCs by chemotaxis toward the gradient source of these factors, suggesting that they may represent the MPCs’ subpopulation. Current data on stimulated directional persistence of NCCs supports the participation of diffusible molecules in the target colonization mechanism, guiding MPCs to migrate and invade the skin. Our results show similar effects of SE and SCF on NCC growth, proliferation and pigment cell differentiation. Also, the use of a proven real-time directionality-based objective assay shows the directional migration of NCCs toward SE and SCF, indicating that the epidermal SCF molecule may be involved in the chemotactic guidance mechanism of in vivo NCCs. Although SCF is the strongest candidate to account for these phenomena, the nature of other factor(s) affecting NCC-oriented migration remains to be investigated. This data amplifies the functional scope of trophic factors by involving them in new cell behaviors such as molecular guidance in the colonization mechanism of embryonic cells.

Abstract: Our earlier studies on the structural and functional properties of zebrafish thrombocytes have shown that they have many similarities to mammalian platelets. We have also shown that zebrafish have both young and mature thrombocytes as do mammalian platelets. In addition, we have distinguished young thrombocytes from mature thrombocytes microscopically using lipophilic DiI-C18, and have shown that young thrombocytes have higher GPIIb receptor levels. However, at present, there is no immunoselection method to separate young thrombocytes from mature thrombocytes in order to study differences among them, such as mRNA expression levels of thrombocyte specific genes. We developed a novel technique employing specific biotinylated anti-Cy3 antibody against the chromophore of DiI-C18 and using streptavidin magnetic beads to separate young thrombocytes from mature thrombocytes. Our technique separates and differentiates young and mature thrombocytes from whole blood. This method is specific and is effective with small amounts of blood.

Abstract: Bendamustine is clinically useful in mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL). Its favorable toxicity profile in-vivo favors its combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Cytarabine is a key drug in the treatment of younger patients with MCL. The current study investigated the in-vitro cytotoxic effect of bendamustine and cytarabine, alone or combined, on two MCL cell lines representing the classic and blastoid variant of the lymphoma subtype (JEKO-1 and GRANTA-519). Cell lines were exposed to each drug alone, or simultaneously and consecutively to both drugs, for different time schedules. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial damage, cell proliferation/metabolic activity, and cell cycle analysis were also assessed. The synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects of the drugs were calculated with the combination index (CI) method. Bendamustine and cytarabine alone exhibited relevant cytotoxic activity on both cell lines. Both drugs induced cell cycle arrest in S phase. Drug combinations were associated with significantly higher cytotoxic effects than each drug alone. Among the combination schedules, the consecutive incubation of bendamustine followed by cytarabine was associated with the lower CI, being 10–100-fold lower than with simultaneous incubations. The cytotoxic effect of the consecutive combination was prominent on both cell lines, indicating a very strong and highly significant synergy in inducing apoptosis. Similar results were obtained measuring mitochondrial damage or the decline of the metabolic activity in all cell lines. The strong synergistic effect of bendamustine and cytarabine on MCL cells provides a rationale for developing schedules combining these agents in the treatment of MCL.

Abstract: In order to optimize viral gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells we developed retroviral and lentiviral vectors with B cell-specificity. Using fragments of the human CD19 promoter we demonstrate in mice that upon lethal irradiation and reconstitution with virus-treated bone marrow transgene expression is specific for the B cell-lineage. We compare various viral constructs with different promoter length and with or without B cell-specific enhancer regions in retro- and lentiviral backbones. Our data suggest that B cell-targeting for gene therapy approaches is feasible, leads to stable expression, and can be modulated by using different transduction and expression systems.

Abstract: In the present paper we have updated the G6PD mutations database, including all the last discovered G6PD genetic variants. We underline that the last database has been published by Vulliamy et al. [1] who analytically reported 140 G6PD mutations: along with Vulliamy's database, there are two main sites, such as http://202.120.189.88/mutdb/ and www.LOVD.nl/MR, where almost all G6PD mutations can be found. Compared to the previous mutation reports, in our paper we have included for each mutation some additional information, such as: the secondary structure and the enzyme 3D position involving by mutation, the creation or abolition of a restriction site (with the enzyme involved) and the conservation score associated with each amino acid position. The mutations reported in the present tab have been divided according to the gene's region involved (coding and non-coding) and mutations affecting the coding region in: single, multiple (at least with two bases involved) and deletion. We underline that for the listed mutations, reported in italic, literature doesn't provide all the biochemical or bio-molecular information or the research data. Finally, for the “old” mutations, we tried to verify features previously reported and, when subsequently modified, we updated the specific information using the latest literature data.

Abstract: Monocytes/macrophages link the innate and adaptive immune systems, and in inflammatory disorders their activation leads to tissue damage. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a natural peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) ligand, has garnered much interest because it possesses anti-inflammatory properties in a number of experimental models. However, whether it regulates monocytes/macrophage pathophysiology is still unknown. This study was designed to examine the effects of 15d-PGJ2 on the phagocytosis, proliferation and inflammatory cytokines generation in mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and J774A.1 cells upon lipopolysaccharide challenge. Our results showed that 15d-PGJ2 inhibited the phagocytic activity and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and suppressed proinflammatory cytokines expression, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β1, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. These effects were independent of PPARγ, because PPARγ agonist (troglitazone or ciglitazone) and PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) did not affect these activities mentioned above in cells. Treatment of 15d-PGJ2 also did not modulate expression and distribution of PPARγ. However, these effects of 15d-PGJ2 were abrogated by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Moreover, treatment of 15d-PGJ2 induced a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production in RAW264.7 and J774A.1 cells. In conclusion, 15d-PGJ2 attenuates the biological activities of mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line cells involving oxidative stress, independently of PPARγ. These data further underline the anti-inflammation potential of 15d-PGJ2.

Abstract: An electrochemical treatment was developed to passivate pinhole defects in photovoltaic devices consisting of the device stack: glass substrate/SnO2:F/CdS/CdTe/Cu/Au (metal/back contact). Samples were carefully examined and only those possessing a high density of pinholes through the CdS and CdTe layers were chosen for this study. The presence of a pinhole defect through these layers would lead to the formation of a wire-like connection through the photovoltaic device (shunt), which would seriously degrade the overall performance of the photovoltaic device, on deposition of the metal back contact. We report a solution to this problem wherein the pinhole defects are selectively filled with a resistive material such as polyaniline, using an electrochemical polymerization of the aniline monomer. After the polymer film deposition, this new layer acts as an insulator plug, and prevents the metallic back contact (Cu–Au) from making electrical contact with the transparent conductive oxide (SnO2:F) layer, thus avoiding shunting of the photovoltaic device. Characterization techniques employed in this study are current–voltage measurements to measure the photovoltaic performance of treated and untreated devices and SEM–EDS microscopy and Grazing Angle X-ray diffraction to study the CdTe surface chemistry.

Abstract: Few data are available on the prevalence and the risk factors for the presence of kidney stones and hyperuricemia in patients with thalassemia intermedia. We retrospectively reviewed the charts and radiological studies of 89 patients with thalassemia intermedia followed at our clinic with routine biochemical examination and radiological imaging of the urinary tract. Renal calculi were identified in 11 patients (12%) and 22 patients (25%) were under uricosuric treatment for hyperucemia. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis increased with age but not in a statistically significant manner. Major risk factors for renal stone formation were splenectomy (in 91% of the cases) and higher number of erythroblasts. Patients with renal stones had higher mean creatinine level and lower GFR value with respect to those observed in patients not affected. Our data suggest that splenectomy, by further increasing erythrocyte turnover and number, may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia and nephrolithiasis observed in thalassemia intermedia patients.

Abstract: Recessive congenital methemoglobinemia (RCM) is a very rare disorder caused by NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (cb5r) deficiency. Two distinct clinical forms, types I and II, caused by cb5r deficiency have been recognized. In type I, the enzyme deficiency is restricted only to erythrocytes with cyanosis being the only major symptom. In contrast, in type II, the enzyme deficiency is generalized to all tissues and associated with neurological impairment, mental and growth retardation and reduced life expectancy, in addition to cyanosis. Recently, we conducted a study on an 11-year-old boy with cb5r deficiency type I. The mutational analysis of the CYB5R3 gene revealed that the boy is homozygous for L72P mutation. Surprisingly, his mother is heterozygous for this L72P mutant, but not his father. Thirteen microsatellite markers of chromosome 22 were selected to analyze the origins of the patient's chromosome 22. The result showed that both of the chromosome 22(s) of this patient came from the maternal side (uniparental heterodisomy of chromosome 22 with segmental isodisomy). This is the first case report of a patient with cb5r deficiency type I resulting from uniparental disomy and also discloses an alternate mechanism whereby this enzymatic disorder can be derived from a single parent.

Abstract: The NIMA-related kinase Nek2 promotes centrosome separation at the G2/M transition and, consistent with this role, is known to be concentrated at the proximal ends of centrioles. Here, we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that Nek2 also localises to the distal portion of the mother centriole. Its accumulation at this site is cell cycle-dependent and appears to peak in late G2. These findings are consistent with previous data implicating Nek2 in promoting reorganisation of centrosome-anchored microtubules at the G2/M transition, given that microtubules are anchored at the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole in interphase. In addition, we report that siRNA-mediated depletion of Nek2 compromises the ability of cells to resorb primary cilia before the onset of mitosis, while overexpression of catalytically active Nek2A reduces ciliation and cilium length in serum-starved cells. Based on these findings, we propose that Nek2 has a role in promoting cilium disassembly at the onset of mitosis. We also present evidence that recruitment of Nek2 to the proximal ends of centrioles is dependent on one of its substrates, the centrosome cohesion protein C-Nap1.

Abstract: Background
The G6PD c.563 C>T deficient mutation is endemic among Mediterranean populations but its clinical significance is not well delineated. We set up to estimate the proportion of G6PD deficient children presenting with hemolytic anemia at Al Nasser Pediatric Hospital at Gaza Strip, Palestine. We then established the prevalence of c.563T Mediterranean mutation and its linkage to c.1311 C>T polymorphism in this population.
Design and Methods
G6PD deficiency was identified in children presenting with hemolytic anemia at Al Nasser Pediatric Hospital by spectrophotometric measurement of G6PD activity. G6PD exon 6 and exon 11 were amplified from genomic DNA and evaluated for c.563T mutation by sequencing and the c.1311T polymorphism by restriction fragment analysis. Seventy X-chromosomes (60 males and 5 females) from G6PD deficient patients and 40 X-chromosomes from a control group known to be not G6PD deficient were tested.
Results
Over 80% of these children presenting with hemolytic anemia were G6PD deficient and 34% of these had the Mediterranean G6PD deficient variant. The allelic frequencies of Mediterranean c.563T and c.1311T polymorphisms among G6PD deficient patients were 0.33 and 0.38 respectively. The c.1311T polymorphism was linked in 95.2% of patients with the Mediterranean mutation, an allele frequency of 0.87, compared to the control non-G6PD deficient group with an allele frequency of 0.18.
Conclusions
We conclude that G6PD deficiency accounts for majority of hemolytic anemia encountered in Gaza children treated at Al Nasser Pediatric Hospital Emergency department. The Mediterranean mutation c.563T, while not accounting for a majority of G6PD deficiency, is common among G6PD deficient Gaza Strip Palestinians and is frequently, but not always, linked to the c.1311T polymorphism. This work provides a foundation for the population screening of Palestinians for G6PD deficiency and for investigations of ancestral origin of the Mediterranean variant in world populations.

Abstract: Platelet dysfunction and thrombocytopenia are common responses to sepsis, but how sepsis changes platelet function is not completely understood. This is due, in part, to our lack of understanding of how sepsis alters platelet protein patterns. The aim of the present study, accordingly, was to investigate the response of the platelet proteome to sepsis. We applied proteomic technology to analyze platelet samples of rats with sepsis. Rats were divided into two groups: 1) sham surgery and 2) sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Platelet samples were collected from surviving rats 12 and 24h after surgery, and platelet proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). In the CLP group, there were 20 spots that were statistically significantly different at 12h. Of these spots, 16 spots were increased and four spots were decreased. At 24h, there were six spots increased in the CLP group. Of the 26 spots, 12 proteins associated with platelet activation, acute phase proteins, cytoskeleton structure, and energy production were identified. Of interest, alpha-1-antitrypsin precursor (AAT) and ATP synthase beta subunit (ATPB) were both increased at 12 and 24h of sepsis by 2-DE and immunoblotting. By providing the platelet profiles, our results demonstrate that this proteomic approach brings us closer to understanding how platelet dysfunction develops after sepsis.

Abstract: Aldose reductase (AR) is a key enzyme in the alternative glucose metabolism pathway, the polyol pathway. To date, AR is known to be involved in several secondary complications of diabetes and various kidney diseases. The goal of this study was to elucidate how the Nrf2–anti-oxidant response element (ARE) signal pathway plays a role in TGFβ1's regulation of AR expression in human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs). As an in vitro model system, HRMCs were used to investigate AR mRNA by qPCR, protein by Western blot and enzymatic activity by spectrophotometric assay. The ability of TGFβ1 to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells was measured by electron-spin resonance (ESR) trapping method. Reporter assays were used to test the activity of the AR promoter region, and ChIP was employed to test the direct binding of Nrf2 with the endogenous AR promoter. Treatment of HRMCs with TGFβ1 up-regulated the expression of AR mRNA, protein, and activity level. Additionally, TGFβ1 rapidly increased cellular ROS levels, which in turn activated the Nrf2–ARE pathway. Either inhibition of ROS production or knockdown of Nrf2 in HRMCs decreased the TGFβ1-induction of AR expression. Nrf2 regulated AR luciferase activity specifically via two AREs within the AR promoter, and bound directly to the endogenous AR promoter. Furthermore, the TGFβ1-mediated expression of AR required Nrf2 and was significantly abrogated in Nrf2−/− cells. These data show the regulation of AR by TGFβ1 is induced by TGFβ1 stimulation of ROS, which activates the Nrf2–ARE pathway allowing Nrf2 to directly increase AR expression in HRMCs.

Abstract: Myosin II is a hexameric protein complex consisting of two myosin heavy chains, two myosin essential light chains and two myosin regulatory light chains. Multiple subunit isoforms exist, allowing great diversity in myosin II composition which likely impacts on its contractile properties. Little is known about the evolutionary origin, expression pattern and function of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC2) isoforms. We analysed the evolutionary relationship between smooth muscle (sm), nonmuscle (nm) and nonmuscle-like (nml) MLC2 genes, which encode three homologous proteins expressed in nonmuscle cells. The three genes arose by successive gene duplication events. The high sequence similarity between the tandemly arranged nm- and nml-MLC2 genes is best explained by gene conversion. Urea/glycerol-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and RNA analysis were employed to monitor expression of sm-, nm- and nml-MLC2 in human and mouse cell lines. Conspicuous differences between transformed and non-transformed cells were observed, with sm-MLC2 being suppressed in Ras-transformed cells. Our findings shed light on the evolutionary history of three homologous MLC2 proteins and point to isoform-specific cell growth-related roles in nonmuscle cell myosin II contractility.

Abstract: Background
Ceruloplasmin is a positive acute-phase protein with both anti- and pro-oxidant activities, thus having still unclear physiological functions in inflammatory processes. Importantly, ceruloplasmin has been implicated in iron metabolism due to its ferroxidase activity, assisting ferroportin on cellular iron efflux. Ceruloplasmin can be expressed as a secreted or as a membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-ceruloplasmin), this latter one being reported as expressed mostly in the brain.
Design and methods
We studied the expression of both ceruloplasmin isoforms in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes, mouse macrophages and human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2, using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting techniques. Co-localization of ceruloplasmin and ferroportin was also investigated by immunofluorescence in mouse macrophages.
Results
Ceruloplasmin was detected by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence in membrane and cytosol of all cell types. The cell surface ceruloplasmin was identified as the GPI-isoform and localized in lipid rafts from monocytes, macrophages and HepG2 cells. In macrophages, increased expression levels and co-localization of ferroportin and GPI-ceruloplasmin in cell surface lipid rafts were observed after iron treatment. Such iron upregulation of ceruloplasmin was not observed in HepG2.
Conclusions
Our results revealed an unexpected ubiquitous expression of the GPI-ceruloplasmin isoform in immune and hepatic cells. Different patterns of regulation of ceruloplasmin in these cells may reflect distinct physiologic functions of this oxidase. In macrophages, GPI-ceruloplasmin and ferroportin likely interact in lipid rafts to export iron from cells. Precise knowledge about ceruloplasmin isoforms expression and function in various cell types will help to clarify the role of ceruloplasmin in many diseases related to iron metabolism, inflammation and oxidative biology.

Abstract: Mitosis is a continuous process to separate replicated chromosomes into two daughter cells through prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Although a number of methods have been established to synchronize cells at different phases of the cell cycle, it is difficult to synchronize cells at the specific phases, anaphase and telophase, during mitosis because of the short duration of anaphase. Here, we show that HeLa S3 cells in anaphase and in telophase are successfully enriched by treatment with a combination of low concentrations of the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole and the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin. After 9-h release from thymidine block at G1/S phase, addition of nocodazole at 20ng/ml but not 40ng/ml ensures rapid release from the nocodazole arrest. Subsequently, the cells are cultured in the presence of 50μM blebbistatin for 20 and 50min to enrich cells in anaphase and telophase, respectively. Western blot analysis verifies down-regulation of phospho-histone H3-Ser10, phospho-Aurora A/B/C, and cyclin B1 during M-phase progression. Furthermore, we show how the electrophoretic mobility shifts of the Src-family kinases c-Yes and c-Src can change in each phase of mitosis. These results provide a useful synchronization method for biochemically examining protein dynamics during M-phase progression.

Abstract: Podosomes are multifunctional organelles of invasive cells that combine several key abilities, including adhesion, matrix degradation and mechanosensing. The necessary spatiotemporal fine-tuning of podosome structure, turnover and function implies the existence of an intricate network of proteins, comparable to other integrin-based adhesions. However, no systematic effort has yet been made to map the podosome proteome. Here, we describe the purification of podosome-enriched fractions from primary human macrophages, labelled with isotopically stable amino acids, and the subsequent mass spectrometric analysis of these fractions. We present a consensus list of 203 proteins, comprising 33 known podosome proteins and 170 potential novel components. We also present second-level analyses of the podosome proteome, as well as proof-of-principle experiments by showing that the newly identified components WDR1/AIP-1 and hnRNP-K localise to the core structure of macrophage podosomes. Comparisons with other adhesion structure proteomes confirm that the podosome proteome shares components with focal adhesions and invadopodia, but also reveal an extensive overlap with spreading initiation centres (SICs). We suggest that the consensus list comprises a significant part of the podosome proteome and will be helpful for future studies on podosome structure, composition and function, and also for detailed classification of adhesion structure subtypes.

Abstract: Microtubules are necessary for fusion and elongation of vertebrate muscle cells. In Drosophila, several isoforms of β-Tubulin, the functional subunit of microtubules, are expressed in different tissues of the developing embryo, while solely the β3-Tubulin isoform is detected in large amounts during differentiation of the somatic and visceral musculature. Here we show the unexpected result that all mesodermal tissues develop correctly in β3-Tubulin loss of function mutants. Furthermore, we show that β2-Tubulin transcripts are not detectable in embryos and an exceptional zygotic β1-Tubulin expression in β3-Tubulin mutants cannot be observed. Nevertheless, a maternally contributed β1-Tubulin-GFP fusion protein (from protein trap collection, Buszczak et al., 2007, Genetics 175, 1505–1531) acts in a dominant negative way, disturbing embryonic development from early stages on. This effect can be observed to the same extent in a zygotic β3-Tubulin mutant situation. Our results indicate that the maternally supplied β1-Tubulin based microtubule network is sufficient for myoblast fusion, myotube elongation and sarcomere formation both during visceral and somatic muscle development in Drosophila embryogenesis.

Abstract: Southeast Asian deletion (−−SEA) α-thalassemia is an inherited monogenic disorder of human hemoglobin, and embryonic globin ζ (hemoglobin ζ, zeta globin chain or Hb zeta chain) has been shown to be a marker that can be used for the identification of carriers of the (−−SEA) α-thalassemia deletion. In this work, a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay (FL-ICA) was established to detect the zeta globin chain in the hemolysates of carriers of the (−−SEA) α-thalassemia deletion. This assay can be completed within 10min using a simple UV detector and does not suffer from interference from the red background color of the hemolysate. A total of 314 blood samples were tested by FL-ICA and ELISA. The results of these assays were confirmed by PCR, the standard technique for genetic disease testing. The sensitivity and specificity of this novel FL-ICA were 100% and 98.0%, respectively; the corresponding values for the ELISA performed simultaneously were 100% and 99.2%, respectively. In conclusion, a new FL-ICA–a simple, fast, convenient, low-cost method–was developed that may be useful in both high-throughput screening and individual detection of the (−−SEA) α-thalassemia deletion in carriers. Additionally, this qualitative FL-ICA may enlighten the development of a new systems for analysis of other target molecules using whole-blood samples.

Abstract: Several pathways are involved in the control of endothelial cell morphology, endothelial permeability and function in order to maintain vascular homeostasis. Here we report that protein kinase N3 (PKN3) appears to play a pivotal role in maintaining endothelial cell morphology, cell–cell junctions and motility. An RNAi-based cell biological approach in cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC) revealed that knockdown of PKN3 expression gave rise to cells with divergent cell morphology, impaired locomotion, disturbed adherens junctions (AJ) integrity and irregular actin organization. Notably, knockdown of PKN3 cells led to improper stress fiber formation and marked adhesiveness of intercellular adherens junctions when cells became stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Moreover, TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression on the cell surface was reduced in cells with suppressed PKN3 expression. Finally, loss-of-function for PKN3 appeared to affect Pyk2 phosphorylation in endothelial cells. These observations suggest that PKN3 can be considered a novel protein implicated in remodeling the actin–adherens junction, possibly by linking ICAM-1-signaling with actin/AJ dynamics. We propose that loss of PKN3 function and concomitant aberrations in actin rearrangement may attenuate pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells.

Abstract: Cementoblasts are cells that produce, secrete and direct the production of cementum. Resorption lacunae occur in over 90% of teeth at the compression side of the periodontal ligament and might result in an irreversible loss of the original root length. We isolated and cultivated human primary cementoblasts and investigated their expression pattern concerning markers of the osteoblastogenic differentiation (RUNX2, OCN, ALP, and BSP) and CEMP-1. Compared to osteoblasts, cementoblasts displayed an expression pattern comparable to osteoblasts in an early stage of osteoblastogenic differentiation. Next, the human primary cementoblasts were stimulated with IL-1β (1 and 10ng/ml) for 24 and 96h and subsequently subjected to compressive forces (30.3g/cm2) for 1 and 6h. Our in vitro data demonstrated that BSP and CEMP-1 expression significantly decreased when stimulation was accompanied by compression, while compression or stimulation alone led to increased levels of BSP and decreased levels of CEMP-1. We concluded that human primary cementoblasts subjected to compression and IL-1β stimulation impeded BSP and CEMP-1 expression, proteins that are associated with cementogenesis.

Abstract: The core sequence of 5′HS4-beta globin locus control region and Xmn1-HBG2 site were analyzed and compared among 86 thalassemia patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous beta globin gene mutations and 101 normal individuals. Frequency of the G allele in the polymorphic palindromic sequence of 5′HS4 (TGGGG A/G CCCCA) and positive Xmn1-HBG2 profile was significantly higher in thalassemia patients compared to the normal population. Linkage disequilibrium was observed between the G allele and positive Xmn1-HBG2 profile in patient population. Furthermore, dominance of IVSII-1 in the mutation spectrum of the patients enabled us to identify linkage disequilibrium relationships between IVSII-1, positive Xmn1-HBG2 and the G allele at 5′HS4. The frequency of milder clinical phenotype was significantly higher in patients with GG/++ than cases with AA/−− genotypic pattern in 5′HS4/Xmn1-HBG2 loci. These data together with biochemical evidence suggesting a role for the A/G polymorphism at 5′HS4 palindromic site on modifying chromatin structure and in the absence of any evidence from functional studies relating the Xmn1-HBG2 site to the increased gamma chain expression, suggest that the phenotype modifying role long time assigned to Xmn1-HBG2 is possibly played by more functionally potent elements linked to it in LCR.

Abstract: Cell surface proteins Hfe, Tfr2, hemojuvelin and Tmprss6 play key roles in iron homeostasis. Hfe and Tfr2 induce transcription of hepcidin, a small peptide that promotes the degradation of the iron transporter ferroportin. Hemojuvelin, a co-receptor for bone morphogenic proteins, induces hepcidin transcription through a Smad signaling pathway. Tmprss6 (also known as matriptase-2), a membrane serine protease that has been found to bind and degrade hemojuvelin in vitro, is a potent suppressor of hepcidin expression. In order to examine if Hfe and Tfr2 are substrates for Tmprss6, we generated mice lacking functional Hfe or Tfr2 and Tmprss6. We found that double mutant mice lacking functional Hfe or Tfr2 and Tmprss6 exhibited a severe iron deficiency microcytic anemia phenotype mimicking the phenotype of single mutant mice lacking functional Tmprss6 (Tmprss6 msk/msk mutant) demonstrating that Hfe and Tfr2 are not substrates for Tmprss6. Nevertheless, the phenotype of the mice lacking Hfe or Tfr2 and Tmprss6 differed from Tmprss6 deficient mice alone, in that the double mutant mice exhibited much greater erythropoiesis. Hfe and Tfr2 have been shown to play important roles in the erythron, independent of their role in regulating liver hepcidin transcription. We demonstrate that lack of functional Tfr2 and Hfe allows for increased erythropoiesis even in the presence of high hepcidin expression, but the high levels of hepcidin levels significantly limit the availability of iron to the erythron, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis. Furthermore, repression of hepcidin expression by hypoxia was unaffected by the loss of functional Hfe, Tfr2 and Tmprss6.

Abstract: Hemostasis is a defense mechanism that protects an organism from bleeding in the event of injury. We have previously demonstrated the utility of the zebrafish as a model to study human hemostasis. However, there are no studies on the role of microparticles in hemostasis in early vertebrates. Studying microparticles in zebrafish may provide insight into the evolution of microparticle function in hemostasis and may lead to direct observation of these microparticles in zebrafish larvae due to transparency of the vessels. In this investigation we demonstrate the presence of cellular microparticles in fish blood by both immunostaining as well as by using zebrafish whose thrombocytes are labeled with green fluorescent protein. Further investigation showed that microparticles were also labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate annexin V, suggesting that these particles are derived via apoptosis. A portion of the fluorescein isothiocyanate annexin V labeled microparticles was also labeled by DiI-C18. Labeling by DiI-C18 suggests that some microparticles are derived from young thrombocytes. Additionally, GpIIb antibody labels almost all thrombocyte-derived microparticles and a greater percentage of microparticles are labeled by GpIIb antibody than by DiI-C18. This suggests that thrombocyte microparticles are derived from both young and mature thrombocytes. Furthermore, the increase of microparticles by adding excessive microparticles into blood in vitro and through intravenous injections led to an increased hemostatic response. In addition, treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha resulted in an increased number of thrombocyte microparticles and enhanced hemostasis; in contrast, treatment with zVAD-FMK, a caspase inhibitor, resulted in a decrease in thrombocyte microparticles and decreased hemostasis. We also found that thrombocyte microparticles agglutinate, along with other cells and cellular microparticles, in the presence of an excess of either ristocetin or ultra-large von Willebrand factor. Also, stimulation of von Willebrand factor release in vivo resulted in clusters of thrombocyte microparticles in the veins. Moreover, thrombocyte microparticles were the first to appear at the site of arterial injury. We found that thrombocyte microparticles are functionally equivalent to platelet microparticles. The microparticles initiate arterial thrombus formation in a von Willebrand factor-dependent manner and further enhance thrombus formation by forming clusters of microparticles in venous thrombosis. This finding may have applications for understanding the role of platelet microparticles in humans and may have diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Among the scarce available data about the biological role of the membrane protein CD20, there is some evidence that this protein functions as a store-operated Ca2+ channel and/or regulates transmembrane Ca2+ trafficking. Recent findings indicate that store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) plays a central role in skeletal muscle function and development, but there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to SOCE modulation in this tissue. Here we describe CD20 expression in skeletal muscle, verifying its membrane localization in myoblasts and adult muscle fibers. Additionally, we show that inhibition of CD20 through antibody binding or gene silencing resulted in specific impairment of SOCE in C2C12 myoblasts. Our results provide novel insights into the CD20 expression pattern, and suggest that functional CD20 is required for SOCE to consistently occur in C2C12 myoblasts. These findings may contribute to future identification of mechanisms and molecules involved in the fine regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry in skeletal muscle.

Abstract: The alpha haemoglobin stabilising protein (AHSP) acts as a molecular chaperone for α-globin by stabilising nascent α-globin before transferring it to waiting free β-globin chains. Binding of AHSP to α-globin renders α-globin chemically inert whereby preventing it from precipitating and forming reactive oxygen species byproducts. The AHSP has been actively studied in the recent years, particularly in its relation to β-thalassaemia. Studies have shown that AHSP is a modifier in β-thalassaemia mice models. However, this relationship is less established in humans. Studies by some groups showed no correlation between the AHSP haplotypes and the severity of β-thalassaemia, whereas others have shown that certain AHSP haplotype could modify the phenotype of β-thalassaemia intermedia patients. We investigated the expression of AHSP in relation to selected demographic data, full blood count, HPLC results, HbE/β-thalassaemia genotype, Xmn-1 Gγ polymorphism, α-globin, β-globin and γ-globin expression. We found that AHSP expression was significantly correlated to mean cell haemoglobin level, HbF %, α-globin, β-globin and excess α-globin expression. We concluded that AHSP could be a secondary compensatory mechanism in red blood cells to counterbalance the excess α-globin chains in HbE/β-thalassaemia individuals.

Abstract: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a role in innate and adaptive immunity. Depending on the cellular context and disease state, MIF signaling is mediated by its receptors CXCR2, CXCR4 and/or CD74. Although it is known that MIF is endocytosed, the exact mechanism has remained unknown. In exploring the mechanism of MIF endocytosis with biologically active Alexa546MIF, pathway-specific inhibitors (monodansylcadaverine, MDC; chlorpromazine, CPZ; dynasore; dominant-negative dynamin, bafilomycin, nocodazole) and receptor overexpression and blockade approaches, we identified a clathrin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis pathway as the main track for MIF internalization. MIF endocytosis was rapid and colocalization with both early and late endosomal vesicles in a microtubule- and acidification-dependent manner was observed. LDL endocytosis (which is clathrin-mediated) served as a control and was similarly inhibited by MDC or dynasore. When MIF endocytosis was compared to that of transferrin, acetylated LDL, and choleratoxin B (the latter internalized by a clathrin-independent pathway) by colocalization studies, the MIF internalization pathway clearly resembled that of LDL but also shared early trafficking with transferrin, whereas no colocalization with choleratoxin was noted. To identify the receptors involved in MIF endocytosis, we focused on CD74 and CXCR4 which form a heteromeric complex. Ectopic overexpression of CD74 in HEK293 and HeLa cells, which do not endogenously express CD74, led to a marked acceleration of MIF endocytosis while pharmacological blockade of CXCR4, which is endogenously expressed on these cells, with AMD3100 led to a 20% reduction of MIF endocytosis in HEK293-CD74 transfectants, whereas in untransfected cells, a blockade of 40% was observed. Of note, both CD74 and CXCR4 strongly colocalize with Alexa546MIF both on the plasma membrane and in endosomal compartments. Moreover, MIF-stimulated AKT signaling, which was previously shown to involve both CD74 and CXCR4, was reduced by endocytosis inhibitors, indicating that MIF signaling is at least in part due to endosomal signaling mechanisms. Thus, MIF uptake follows a rapid LDL-like, clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis pathway, which is dependent on the receptors CD74 and CXCR4 and leads to the initiation of endosomal signaling responses.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DC) develop from hematopoietic stem cells, which is guided by instructive signals through cytokines. DC development progresses from multipotent progenitors (MPP) via common DC progenitors (CDP) into DC. Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) signaling via the Flt3/Stat3 pathway is of pivotal importance for DC development under steady state conditions. Additional factors produced during steady state or inflammation, such as TGF-β1 or GM-CSF, also influence the differentiation potential of MPP and CDP. Here, we studied how gp130, GM-CSF and TGF-β1 signaling influence DC lineage commitment from MPP to CDP and further into DC. We observed that activation of gp130 signaling promotes expansion of MPP. Additionally, gp130 signaling inhibited Flt3L-driven DC differentiation, but had little effect on GM-CSF-driven DC development. The inflammatory cytokine GM-CSF induces differentiation of MPP into inflammatory DC and blocks steady state DC development. Global transcriptome analysis revealed a GM-CSF-driven gene expression repertoire that primes MPP for differentiation into inflammatory DC. Finally, TGF-β1 induces expression of DC-lineage affiliated genes in MPP, including Flt3, Irf-4 and Irf-8. Under inflammatory conditions, however, the effect of TGF-β1 is altered: Flt3 is not upregulated, indicating that an inflammatory environment inhibits steady state DC development. Altogether, our data indicate that distinct cytokine signals produced during steady state or inflammation have a different outcome on DC lineage commitment and differentiation.

Abstract: Background
Imatinib mesylate (IM) is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). IM has high efficacy, however some individuals develop a resistance due to impaired bioavailability. Polymorphisms in genes encoding membrane transporters such as ABCB1 have been associated with differences in protein expression and function that influence the response to several drugs.
Aim
To investigate the relationship of ABCB1 polymorphisms with markers of response to IM in patients with CML.
Methods
One hundred eighteen CML patients initially treated with a standard dose of IM (400mg/day) for 18months were selected at two health centers in Sao Paulo City, Brazil. The response criteria were based on the European LeukemiaNet recommendations. ABCB1 polymorphisms c.1236C>T (rs1128503), c.3435C>T (rs1045642) and c.2677G>T/A (rs2032582) were evaluated by PCR-RFLP.
Results
ABCB1 polymorphisms were not related with a risk for CML in this sample population (p<0.05). In the CML group, frequencies of ABCB1 SNPs were similar between responder and non-responder patients (p>0.05). In the responder group, the frequency of ABCB11236CT/2677GT/3435CT haplotype was higher in patients with major molecular response (MMR) (51.7%) than in patients without MMR (8.3%, p=0.010). Furthermore, carriers of this haplotype had increased the probability of reaching the MMR compared with the non-carriers (OR: 11.8; 95% CI: 1.43–97.3, p=0.022).
Conclusions
The ABCB1 1236CT/2677GT/3435CT haplotype is positively associated with the major molecular response to IM in CML patients.

Abstract: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome diagnosed in early infancy that is characterized by a (a) macrocytic anemia with no other significant cytopenia, (b) reticulocytopenia, and (c) normal bone marrow cellularity with a paucity of erythroid precursors. Physical anomalies are often present. Mutations in several ribosomal proteins have been associated with the disease. Here we present a detailed description of 39 patients from 34 families enrolled in the Czech National Diamond-Blackfan Anemia Registry. Erythrocyte adenosine deaminase activity and serum erythropoietin levels were measured and bone marrow analysis and clonogenic assays were carried out. Twenty-two different ribosomal proteins were sequenced. We identified mutations in five different ribosomal proteins in 28/39 patients (71.8%) from 23/34 families (67.6%). Several new mutations are described. The most interesting data relate to genotype–phenotype correlations. All patients with ribosomal protein L5 or ribosomal protein L11 mutations have a thumb defect usually with one or more other anomalies. Most of these patients were born small for gestational age and currently have short stature. We also described five patients with a ribosomal protein S26 mutation. All of the latter are transfusion-dependent and they exhibit skeletal abnormalities rather than thumb or craniofacial deformities. Patients with ribosomal protein S19 seem to bear mildest associated anomalies, usually in a craniofacial region.

Abstract: Thalassemia is the commonest inherited autosomal recessive disorders of hemoglobin in southern China. We developed and evaluated a reverse dot blot (RDB) assay combined with flow-through hybridization technology platform for the rapid and simultaneous identification of 5 types of α-thalassemia and 16 types of β-thalassemia common in Chinese. Reliable genotyping of wild-type and thalassemic genomic DNA samples was achieved by means of a gene chip on which allele-specific oligonucleotide probes were immobilized on a nylon membrane. This method involved two multiplex PCR amplification systems of α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia and one time of hybridization. The whole procedure starting from blood sampling to the identification of thalassemia genotype required less than 4h. The diagnostic reliability of this reverse dot blot assay was evaluated on 427 samples (387 cases of thalassemia and 40 healthy persons) by using direct DNA sequence analysis and gap-PCR in a blind study. These samples included 377 cases of blood, 7 cases of amniotic fluid, 18 cases of chorionic villus, and 25 cases of cord blood. The RDB gene chip was in complete concordance with the reference method. The reverse dot blot assay was a simple, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective method to identify common thalassemia genotypes in the Chinese population.

Abstract: NAC (nascent polypeptide associated complex) is a heterodimer consisting of an α and a β subunit. skNAC (skeletal and heart muscle-specific form of αNAC) is a variant of αNAC, which is induced in muscle differentiation and regeneration. We show here that skNAC expression is regulated by p38 MAPK, which plays a crucial role in myogenesis. Furthermore, inhibition of skNAC expression in myoblasts via specific siRNAs might lead to disturbed incorporation of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) into sarcomeres, however, it has no inhibitory effect on absolute MyHC protein levels. Taken together, our data suggest that skNAC regulates specific aspects of myogenesis.

Abstract: The rescue of recombinant rabies virus (RV) from cloned cDNA is an inefficient process because it relies on the de novo formation within cells of functional ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes from plasmid-expressed viral-like antigenome RNAs and three helper proteins. In the standard RV reverse genetics systems, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase drives the transcription of virus antigenome-like RNAs containing three nonviral G residues at the 5′-end and a correct 3′-end generated by the autocatalytic activity of an 85 nucleotides long hepatitis delta virus antigenomic “core” ribozyme (HDVagrz). Here, we show that employing optimized ribozyme sequences significantly improves RV rescue. Substitution of the “core” HDVagrz by a ribozyme with an enhanced cleavage activity resulted in an approximately 10-fold higher number of rescue events and faster initiation of an infectious cycle. The alternative use of a hammerhead ribozyme for the generation of an exact 5′-end similarly enhanced rescue efficiency. Notably, RV cDNA clones containing the combination of optimized 3′- and 5′-ribozymes were rescued at an at least 100-fold increase. In addition to virus rescue, reporter gene expression from transfected minigenome cDNAs was significantly enhanced by the novel ribozymes. The improved RV reverse genetics system greatly facilitates recovery of strongly attenuated viruses and vectors for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a late onset-disease characterized by skeletal muscle wasting and heart defects with associated risk of sudden death. The autosomal dominant form of the disease is caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding LaminA and C, the X-linked form results from mutations in the gene encoding the inner nuclear membrane protein Emerin (STA). Both Emerin and LaminA/C interact with the nuclear envelope proteins Nesprin-1 and -2 and mutations in genes encoding C-terminal isoforms of Nesprin-1 and -2 have also been implicated in EDMD. Here we analyse primary fibroblasts from patients affected by either Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy/Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (EDMD/CMT) that in addition to the disease causing mutations harbour mutations in the Nesprin-1 gene and in the SUN1 and SUN2 gene, respectively. SUN proteins together with the Nesprins form the core of the LINC complex which connects the nucleus with the cytoskeleton. The mutations are accompanied by changes in cell adhesion, cell migration, senescence, and stress response, as well as in nuclear shape and nuclear envelope composition which are changes characteristic for laminopathies. Our results point to a potential influence of mutations in components of the LINC complex on the clinical outcome and the molecular pathology in the patients.

Abstract: The effects of statin treatment in the setting of heart failure have already been shown. Nevertheless, there is little knowledge about its influence on adrenergic pathways in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of cerivastatin on adrenoceptor-mediated signalling pathways in isolated adult ventricular cardiomyocytes. It focused on two endpoints: hypertrophic growth and TGFbeta expression. Cultured cardiomyocytes were used to study rac activation (analysed by its translocation into the membrane fraction), ROS formation (H2DCF fluorescence) and hypertrophic growth (14C-phenylalanine incorporation). Alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation showed significant differences regarding rac activation, ROS formation, and p38 MAP kinase activation. Both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation induced TGFbeta expression. Upon activation of alpha-adrenergic signalling – although ROS formation was not influenced by cerivastatin – TGFbeta expression decreased. Following beta stimulation, TGFbeta expression as well as rac and p38 MAP kinase activation were reduced after pre-treatment with cerivastatin. Statin treatment did not show any influence on hypertrophic growth. In summary, this study clearly demonstrates the ability of adrenoceptor stimulation to increase TGFbeta expression. One component of the beneficial effects of statin therapy on heart failure might therefore be due to a dominant reduction and inhibition of TGFbeta, which is involved in many pathophysiological processes in cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Hepcidin is an iron-regulatory hepatic peptide hormone encoded by the HAMP gene that downregulates iron export from enterocytes and macrophages into the blood plasma. In this study, we identified a novel mutation in the HAMP gene of a 58-year-old Japanese male patient with hemochromatosis. By direct sequencing of the five hereditary hemochromatosis-related genes, HFE, HAMP, HJV, TFR2, and SLC40A1, the previously unreported p.R75X mutation was identified, and the patient was found to be homozygous for the mutation. No other potentially pathogenic mutations were detected. In an LC-MS/MS analysis, hepcidin molecules were not detected in the patient's serum or urine. These results indicate that the p.R75X mutation causes iron overload by impairing the hepcidin system.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-mediated in vitro human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell migration mainly requires Akt/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), but not mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling,

Abstract: When rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) among other cytokines leaks into the subretinal space, induces resident retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to migrate, which is the initial step of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). In the current study, we aim to understand how this is regulated by focusing the cellular mechanisms involved. Here we indentified an Akt/Tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2)/mTOR complex1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway after TNF-α treatment to mediate RPE cell migration. Suppression of mTORC1 activation, either by its inhibitor rapamycin, or by activation of its suppressor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibited TNF-α-mediated RPE cell migration, while RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knocking-down of SIN1 or Rictor, two key components of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), had no significant effect on TNF-α-induced RPE cell migration. Our data provide initial evidence that TNF-α-mediated in vitro RPE cell migration mainly requires Akt/mTORC1, but not mTORC2 signaling. The results of this study may lead to indentify novel signaling targets against PVR.

Abstract: Synthesis and activation of matrix metalloproteinases during wound healing are important for remodeling the extracellular matrix and modulating various cellular functions. The membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-14) has been shown to play a key role during these processes. To analyze the function of epidermal-derived MMP-14 during skin repair we generated mice lacking MMP-14 expression in the epidermis (MMP-14ep−/−). These mice displayed overall normal skin morphology and epidermal differentiation patterns. Wound repair in MMP-14ep−/− followed the same kinetics as in wild type mice (MMP-14ep+/+), and infiltration of neutrophils, leukocytes, and macrophages into the wound site was comparable. Microscopic analysis showed no altered re-epithelialization in the absence of epidermal MMP-14. Furthermore, epidermal differentiation at the end of the repair process and scar formation was normal. However, at day 14 post wounding, sustained angiogenesis was observed in MMP-14ep−/− mice in contrast to control mice. Interestingly, decreased levels of endostatin were detected in wound lysates of MMP-14ep−/− mice as well as in cultured keratinocytes. Taken together, these data indicate that MMP-14 expression in keratinocytes is dispensable for skin homeostasis and repair, but plays a crucial role in the epidermal–dermal crosstalk leading to modulation of vessel density.

Abstract: The rabies virus (RV) phosphoprotein P is a multifunctional protein involved in viral RNA synthesis and in counteracting host innate immune responses. We have previously shown that RV P gene expression levels can be regulated by using picornavirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. Here we exploited a particular feature of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES, namely, preferential initiation at a downstream initiation codon, to address the role of N-terminally truncated RV phosphoproteins usually generated in RV-infected cells through ribosomal leaky scanning. Recombinant RVs in which P synthesis was directed by the poliovirus or FMDV IRES produced full-length P (P1) or a truncated form (P2), as the dominant product, respectively. While the P2 overexpressing virus showed attenuated growth in interferon-incompetent cells, it was superior to the P1 overexpressing virus in preventing expression of host interferon-stimulated genes. This indicates that in RV infected cells the availability of the truncated P2 protein is critical for viral resistance to interferon.

Abstract: Recent data have suggested novel ways to enhance donor cell engraftment by treating transplanted recipients with CXCR4/CXCL12 inhibitors, thereby expanding the biologic potential of these molecules primarily used for mobilization purposes. We tested whether repeated pulse inhibitions of CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling using AMD, an inhibitor of CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling, would enhance engraftment in non-myeloablated murine recipients, similar to data published in a myeloablative setting. We documented an increased proportion of circulating neutrophils (both donor- and host-derived) in the AMD-treated group, but this increase was not kinetically influenced by AMD treatment and multilineage engraftment was not enhanced. Although our results with neutrophils are similar to recent clinical data in neutropenic patients chronically treated with AMD, the absence of multilineage engraftment diverges from data in myeloablated recipients. We conclude that pulses of mobilization by AMD post transplantation do not enhance multilineage engraftment.

Abstract: Increased maternal and foetal iron requirements during pregnancy are compensated by an increase of intestinal iron absorption. Animal studies have shown that the expression of the main iron regulator hepcidin is significantly suppressed during pregnancy, but the factors associated with hepcidin suppression remain unknown. To investigate possible suppressors of hepcidin expression during pregnancy we determined serum concentrations of growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF15), erythropoietin (EPO), soluble hemojuvelin (HJV) and hepcidin in 42 pregnant women at different time points of gestation and correlated them with serum iron and haematological parameters. Serum iron parameters and serum hepcidin concentration significantly decreased during pregnancy, whereas serum concentrations of GDF15, EPO and soluble HJV significantly increased. A negative correlation of hepcidin with EPO and soluble HJV but no correlation between hepcidin and GDF15 was found. Hepcidin and ferritin were positively correlated throughout the pregnancy. Our findings suggest that hepcidin expression is controlled by body iron stores where soluble HJV and EPO may act as suppressors of hepcidin.

Formation of atypical podosomes in extravillous trophoblasts regulates extracellular matrix degradation,

Abstract: Throughout pregnancy the cytotrophoblast, the stem cell of the placenta, gives rise to the differentiated forms of trophoblasts. The two main cell lineages are the syncytiotrophoblast and the invading extravillous trophoblast. A successful pregnancy requires extravillous trophoblasts to migrate and invade through the decidua and then remodel the maternal spiral arteries. Many invasive cells use specialised cellular structures called invadopodia or podosomes in order to degrade extracellular matrix. Despite being highly invasive cells, the presence of invadapodia or podosomes has not previously been investigated in trophoblasts. In this study these structures have been identified and characterised in extravillous trophoblasts. The role of specialised invasive structures in trophoblasts in the degradation of the extracellular matrix was compared with well characterised podosomes and invadopodia in other invasive cells and the trophoblast specific structures were characterised by using a sensitive matrix degradation assay which enabled visualisation of the structures and their dynamics. We show trophoblasts form actin rich protrusive structures which have the ability to degrade the extracellular matrix during invasion. The degradation ability and dynamics of the structures closely resemble podosomes, but have unique characteristics that have not previously been described in other cell types. The composition of these structures does not conform to the classic podosome structure, with no distinct ring of plaque proteins such as paxillin or vinculin. In addition, trophoblast podosomes protrude more deeply into the extracellular matrix than established podosomes, resembling invadopodia in this regard. We also show several significant pathways such as Src kinase, MAPK kinase and PKC along with MMP-2 and 9 as key regulators of extracellular matrix degradation activity in trophoblasts, while podosome activity was regulated by the rigidity of the extracellular matrix.

Abstract: Long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme A synthetases activate fatty acids for anabolic or catabolic metabolism. They often localize to more than one organelle within eukaryotic cells. Dictyostelium contains two of these proteins, FcsA and FcsB with the latter being targeted to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum by virtue of an N-terminal signal sequence and from there appears to move on to peroxisomes. Deletion of this signal favors the peripheral association of the protein with the mitochondrial surface instead. A strain lacking the activity of the FcsB enzyme was constructed by homologous recombination. It has a severe deficiency in the phagocytic uptake of particles, which can be partially alleviated by a peroxisomally targeted, soluble FcsA enzyme. It is, however, not rescued by expressing FcsA in the cytoplasm or targeting it to the ER, indicating that peroxisomal β-oxidation is important for phagocytosis. In a fcsA−/B− double mutant phagocytosis efficiency is similar to fcsB− cells. However, unlike the single mutants, the fcsA−/B− strain is delayed in morphogenesis, but forms viable spores, albeit within a small fruiting body. This developmental defect is also seen in other mutants affecting peroxisomal enzymes involved in β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle.

Abstract: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is an immunodeficiency caused by defects in the adhesion of leukocytes (especially neutrophils) to the blood vessel wall. As a result, patients with LAD suffer from severe bacterial infections and impaired wound healing, accompanied by neutrophilia. In LAD-I, mutations are found in ITGB2, the gene that encodes the β subunit of the β2 integrins. This syndrome is characterized directly after birth by delayed separation of the umbilical cord. In the rare LAD-II disease, the fucosylation of selectin ligands is disturbed, caused by mutations in SLC35C1, the gene that encodes a GDP-fucose transporter of the Golgi system. LAD-II patients lack the H and Lewis Lea and Leb blood group antigens. Finally, in LAD-III (also called LAD-I/variant) the conformational activation of the hematopoietically expressed β integrins is disturbed, leading to leukocyte and platelet dysfunction. This last syndrome is caused by mutations in FERMT3, encoding the kindlin-3 protein in all blood cells that is involved in the regulation of β integrin conformation.

Abstract: Hemoglobin H disease (Hb H) arises through the loss or dysfunction of three of the four alpha globin genes through the co-inheritance of either gross gene deletions or an abnormal hemoglobin which causes a non-deletional loss of α-globin expression. This study sought to investigate erythropoiesis in Hb H-Constant Spring (Hb H-CS) disease, a common form of Hb H disease in Southeast Asia, caused by the inheritance of the Constant Spring variant hemoglobin together with deletion of two of the alpha globin genes. In comparison to normal erythroblasts, Hb H-CS erythroblasts showed reduced cell expansion although no difference in differentiation was observed. Proteomic analysis revealed the increased expression of both chaperone and chaperonin proteins as well as down regulation of proteins regulating apoptosis. Both chaperone and chaperonin mediated folding require ATP, and evidence of increase energy demand was seen in the form of increased expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis and increased levels of reactive oxygen species. A significant increase in apoptosis was seen in Hb H-CS erythroblasts, and the results from the proteomic analysis suggest that this arises at least in part from the consequences of increased folding requirements in the Hb H-CS erythroblast.

Abstract: Although the mechanism of action of leukemic oncogene Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) remains unclear, WT1 has already been used in monitoring of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and it is being tested for immunotherapy. More detailed understanding of the role of WT1 in leukemia may improve its utilization. At least 36 isoforms may be produced. Four major variants denoted as −5/−KTS, −5/+KTS, +5/−KTS and +5/+KTS are produced by combining splicing of exon 5 and KTS sequence. In this study, we report applicability of newly developed real-time RT PCRs enabling for the first time full quantification of the four major WT1 splicing variants. Following careful optimization and testing of quantification reliability of four assays, we analyzed 34 samples of patients with AML and 12 samples of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at the time of diagnosis. Analyses of five more CML patients provided insight into WT1 variants expression kinetics. We found predominance of +5/+KTS in both diagnoses. Comparison of WT1 variant expression in AML and CML patients' groups differing in response to therapy suggested possible importance of particular WT1 variant levels as markers of further disease course.

Abstract: Background
TMPRSS6 A736V is associated with lower transferrin saturation (TS), hemoglobin (Hb), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels in general adult populations. We sought to identify relationships of TMPRSS6 K253E, A736V, and Y739Y to iron, erythrocyte, and pica phenotypes in women with iron deficiency or depletion.
Methods
We tabulated observations on 48 outpatient non-pregnant women who had iron deficiency (serum ferritin (SF) <14pmol/L and TS <10%) or iron depletion (SF<112pmol/L). We performed direct sequencing of TMPRSS6 exons 7 and 17 in each patient. We used age, TS, SF, Hb, MCV, pica, and TMPRSS6 allele positivity (dichotomous) or mutation genotypes (trichotomous) as variables for analyses.
Results
Forty-six women were white; two were black. 58.3% had iron deficiency. 45.8% had pica (pagophagia, each case). Allele frequencies were 41.7% (K253E), 36.5% (A736V), and 39.6% (Y739Y). K253E frequency was greater in women with TS ≥10% (p=0.0001). Y739Y was more frequent in women with TS <10% (p=0.0135). Mean TS was also lower in women positive for Y739Y (6±4% vs. 13±16%, respectively; p=0.0021). In multiple regressions, neither K253E, A736V, nor Y739Y genotypes were significantly associated with other variables.
Conclusions
TMPRSS6 K253E frequency was greater in women with TS ≥10%. Frequency of Y739 was greater in women with TS <10%. Mean TS was lower in women with Y739Y. We observed no other significant relationship of TMPRSS6 K253E, A736V, or Y739Y with iron, erythrocyte, or pica phenotypes.

Abstract: We describe here the development and characterization of a conditionally inducible mouse model expressing Lifeact-GFP, a peptide that reports the dynamics of filamentous actin. We have used this model to study platelets, megakaryocytes and melanoblasts and we provide evidence that Lifeact-GFP is a useful reporter in these cell types ex vivo. In the case of platelets and megakaryocytes, these cells are not transfectable by traditional methods, so conditional activation of Lifeact allows the study of actin dynamics in these cells live. We studied melanoblasts in native skin explants from embryos, allowing the visualization of live actin dynamics during cytokinesis and migration. Our study revealed that melanoblasts lacking the small GTPase Rac1 show a delay in the formation of new pseudopodia following cytokinesis that accounts for the previously reported cytokinesis delay in these cells. Thus, through use of this mouse model, we were able to gain insights into the actin dynamics of cells that could only previously be studied using fixed specimens or following isolation from their native tissue environment.

Abstract: Introduction
Expression of hepatobiliary transporters is decreased during endotoxemia. Reduction of Mrp2 is mediated by IL-1β-dependent signals but underlying mechanisms are still unclear. YB-1 is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein that translocates to the nucleus in response to various stimuli. Previously we have shown that YB-1 down-regulates Mrp2 expression in vitro. Therefore we investigated the potential role of YB-1 as regulator of hepatic acute phase genes.
Methods
Liver sections from LPS-injected rats (20h) were stained with YB-1-specific antibodies. Real-time RT-PCR quantification was performed for Mrp2, MMP-2 and YB-1. YB-1 protein was quantified from IL-1β- or TNFα-stimulated rat hepatoma cells (FaO) and the localization of a YFP-YB-1-CFP fusion protein was visualized by confocal microscopy in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. ChIP-assays and EMSA were performed to analyze YB-1 binding to DNA promoter elements.
Results
In endotoxemic livers Mrp2 mRNA was down-regulated by 80%, while YB-1 mRNA expression increased 2.5-fold. Immunohistochemical staining showed a marked up-regulation and predominant nuclear localization of YB-1 protein in LPS challenged rats. In FAO cells IL-1β incubation increased cytoplasmic YB-1 protein content up to 16h. IL-1β stimulation resulted in a 6-fold up-regulation of endogenous YB-1 in the nuclear compartment, which occurred within 90min. In accord with these findings nuclear fluorescence was detected with a YFP-YB-1-CFP fusion protein introduced in HepG2 cells. In addition to DNA binding studies with endotoxemic rat liver tissue, ChIP assays revealed an IL-1β-dependent increase of YB-1 binding to the Mrp2-promoter in FAO cells.
Conclusion
YB-1 is activated during the hepatic acute phase response. IL-1β promotes a rapid nuclear YB-1 protein shuttling in hepatoma cells within 90min and a transcriptional induction thereafter. This biphasic response may explain the IL-1β-mediated suppression of Mrp2 expression in endotoxemic rats.

Abstract: Inherited antithrombin (AT) deficiency carries a 50% risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of type I AT deficiency in two women with recurrent VTE in the first trimester of pregnancy. Phenotype analysis showed both probands had almost 50% of normal AT levels. Two novel heterozygous AT mutations were identified: g.7920C>T resulting in a Trp225Cys mutation in case 1 and g.13863C>A causing an Ala404Asp mutation in case 2. Transient expression of either wild-type (WT) or mutant AT expression vectors in HEK293T and CHO cells showed impaired secretion of both AT mutant proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the staining of AT-Trp225Cys in both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus was similar to that of AT-WT, and the staining of AT-Ala404Asp was mainly present in ER but was weaker than that of AT-WT. These results revealed that the type I AT deficiency in two patients was caused by impaired secretion of the AT-Trp225Cys and AT-Ala404Asp mutant proteins, respectively. The two mutations are associated with a high risk of thrombotic onset and women with these AT mutations are prone to VTE in early pregnancy.

Abstract: Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common genetic bleeding disorder, is caused by defects in Von Willebrand factor (VWF). Quantitative deficiencies of the protein lead to either VWD type3, the severe form of the disease or VWD type1 with milder clinical manifestation. Null alleles are the most common mutations in VWF gene causing type3. However, some of these mutations are not translated into the protein and are selectively degraded at mRNA level by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Here, we have studied a large VWD type3 pedigree with a premature termination codon (PTC) causing insertion mutation (c.7674-7675insC) in VWF exon 45. We further investigated the impact of the mutation on the VWF mRNA expression using a quantitative Real-time PCR assay and cDNA sequencing. The relative expression of the gene was significantly decreased in the patients' platelets (Mean ratio=0.03 (0.01–0.05), p=0.001) compared to their normal relatives. The heterozygote carriers of the mutation had lower than normal VWF mRNA levels (Mean ratio=0.62 (0.29–0.91), p=0.006). Direct sequencing of exon 45 on the platelet-derived cDNA in the carriers revealed only the wild-type allele confirming the decay of the mutation carrying allele. In conclusion, quantitative analysis of VWF gene expression showed that c.7674-7675insC mutation in VWF gene resulted in degradation of VWF mRNA via NMD. This pathway might play an important role in the pathogenesis of VWD characterized by quantitative deficiency of VWF due to reduced mRNA levels.

Abstract: The spatially resolved bulk lifetimes of silicon bricks can be obtained by spectral photoluminescence intensity ratio imaging. The underlying principle of this method, relevant experimental data and studies discussing its residual artefacts and limitations were published recently. To further discuss the accuracy and drawbacks of the method, the impact of lateral carrier diffusion into grain boundaries and the influence of free carrier absorption are analysed theoretically. A criterion is given by which the impact of minority carrier diffusion on the bulk lifetime image can be rated depending on both the distance to the grain boundary and the local grain bulk lifetime. We find that the impact of free carrier absorption on the calculation of quantitative bulk lifetime can be neglected for bricks commonly used for solar cell fabrication. However, free carrier absorption needs to be accounted for bricks with lifetimes in the millisecond range such as can be found in Czochralski grown material.

Abstract: Anemia of inflammation is characterized by disturbances in systemic iron homeostasis. In order to better understand the events involved, we carried out a time-course study on the effects of acute and chronic inflammation on iron-related proteins in mouse splenic macrophages and the liver. Mice were sacrificed at various time points ranging from 0h up to 4weeks after induction of inflammation with turpentine oil. Expression levels of iron-related proteins in the splenic macrophages and liver were determined. Iron levels in the serum, spleen and liver were also measured. Hepatic hepcidin was found to be induced in response to inflammation. In the macrophages, expression levels of ferroportin and TfR1 were decreased at some of the time points. The expression of hepatic TfR1 and ferritin was significantly higher at the early time points. Ferritin levels in the liver decreased progressively thereafter; this was associated with significantly higher ferroportin expression in the liver, despite high levels of hepcidin, suggesting that hepcidin may not regulate ferroportin levels in the liver, unlike in the macrophages. The effects of hepcidin, thus, appeared to be tissue-specific. Serum iron levels were decreased initially; these then rose and were associated with decreasing iron levels in the liver and spleen. Thus, inflammation affected the expression levels of many proteins involved in iron homeostasis in splenic macrophages and the liver, with differences seen in the effects at these 2 sites. These effects are likely to contribute to the development of anemia of inflammation.

Abstract: Philadelphia chromosome results of a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. The translocation generates a chimeric oncogene, which, depending on the precise location of the fusion causes chronic myelogenous leukemia, CML (p210bcr-abl) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL (p190bcr-abl). The difference between p190bcr-abl and p210bcr-abl resides in the unique presence of the DH/PH domain in p210bcr-abl. Ba/F3 cells are not motile but acquire spontaneous motility upon ectopic expression of either p190bcr-abl or p210bcr-abl. Whereas p210bcr-abl-expressing cells present typical amoeboid motility, p190bcr-abl-expressing cells motility appears dependent on rolling movements. Both motility types are triggered by Vav1 in complex with Bcr-Abl, and dependent on Rac1 activity. Interestingly, the RhoA specific p210bcr-abl DH/PH domain regulates the motility mode by shifting motility from a rolling type toward an amoeboid one. In this study, we show that Ba/F3p190bcr-abl-expressing cells assemble invadopodia-like structures visualized as dense F-actin dots containing the actin polymerization machinery and bestowed with matrix degradation activities. The formation of these structures is driven by the reduction of RhoA activity associated with the loss of the DH/PH domain in p190bcr-abl and correlates with an increase in Cdc42 activity. Such phenotype could also be obtained by impairing p210bcr-abl RhoA GEF function. Thus, invadopodia formation in association with rolling-type motility characterizes p190bcr-abl leukemic cells. The description of invadopodia in cells harboring the p190bcr-abl oncoprotein presents a novel feature of these highly invasive leukemic cells and provides a novel therapeutic drug target to treat the disease.

Abstract: Previously, we cloned two Branchiostoma IF proteins A3 and B2 and demonstrated that both can form heteropolymeric IF based on a coiled coil dimer consisting of one B2 and one A3 polypeptide. In this study we continued in the characterisation of the B2/A3 heterodimer by searching for the sequences that play an important role in the triggering of the B2/A3 heterodimer. Using a series of deletion and chimeric B2, A3 and B1 constructs and the overlay assay as a tool, we were able to identify a part of the B2 sequence (segment 1A, linker L1 and the N-terminal part of segment 1B) which retains the ability of the full length protein B2 to specifically recognize A3 in blot overlays. Moreover, inspection of this A3-competent B2 fragment identified a short sequence in segment 1B which shares with the currently known trigger-like motif of cortexillin and other coiled coil proteins potential to form multiple inter-chain ionic interactions. Thus, a common and essential feature of trigger sequences with different primary structures found so far in IF and other coiled coil proteins seems to be their ability to form multiple inter-chain ionic interactions which brings the chains close to one another and allows coiled coil formation to propagate accordingly.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify the pathways associated with the ability of CD138+ human myeloma cells to form colonies in a serum-free semi-solid human collagen-based assay. Only 26% (7 of 27) of human myeloma cell lines were able to spontaneously form colonies. This spontaneous clonogenic growth correlated with the expression of the NOTCH ligand JAG2 (p<0.001). Blocking JAG-NOTCH interactions with NOTCH-Fc chimeric molecules impaired self-colony formation, indicating a role for JAG-NOTCH pathway in colony formation. In two cell lines, silencing of JAG2 blocked both colony formation and in vivo tumor formation in immunocompromised mice. RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis revealed that JAG2 is often expressed by CD138+ primary cells. Our results indicate that spontaneous clonogenic growth of myeloma cells requires the expression of JAG2.

Abstract: Variations at the KLF1 gene have been associated with a series of human erythroid phenotypes including the In-(Lu) phenotype, hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, borderline HbA2 and increased red blood cell protoporphyrin. Natural mutations have shown that KLF1 regulates gamma globin gene expression and its role in the switching from fetal to adult globin expression has been suggested by experimental studies. In this paper we report that subjects with S270X KLF1 mutations show a decrease of HbF levels with increasing age, supporting in vivo the role of KLF1 in hemoglobin switching in humans.

Abstract: Several angiopoietin-like (ANGPTL) molecules have been implicated in enhancement of ex-vivo expansion of murine and human (hu) hematopoietic stem cells, but there are no reports on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). We assessed purified recombinant endotoxin-free hu ANGPTL-2 Coiled-Coil (CC), -3, -3CC, -3 fibrinogen-like domain (FLD), -4, -4CC, -5CC, -6 and -7 for effects on proliferation and survival of HPCs from hu cord blood (CB). None of the ANGPTL molecules stimulated CB HPC proliferation, or enhanced or inhibited colony formation of CB HPC stimulated by various growth factors. However, ANGPTL-2CC, -3, and -3CC significantly enhanced survival of HPC (CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-GEMM) subjected to delayed addition of growth factors. Survival enhancing effects of ANGPTL-3 were neutralized by purified anti-ANGPTL-3, but not by anti-ANGPTL-4, -6, or -7. ANGPTL-2CC, -3, and -3CC, but not -4, -6, or -7 also enhanced replating capacity of single CB CFU-GEMM colonies, an estimate of the self-renewal capabilities of HPCs, by greater than 2 fold. Effects of at least ANGPTL-3CC may in part be mediated through phosphorylation of ERK. The ANGPTL molecules did not influence ex-vivo expansion of hu CB CD34+ cells, alone, or in combination with SCF, TPO, Flt3-ligand, with or without IL-3. Thus, among ANGPTL family members, ANGPTL-2 and -3 had enhancing activities on human HPC survival and replating activity, effects requiring the CC domain of the ANGPTL molecules. This information is of relevance to hu HPC regulation.

Inflammatory response in human skeletal muscle cells: CXCL10 as a potential therapeutic target,

Abstract: Inflammatory myopathies (IMs) are systemic diseases characterized by a T helper (Th) 1 type inflammatory response and cell infiltrates within skeletal muscles. The mainstay of treatment is drugs aimed at suppressing the immune system – corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. About 25% of patients are non-responders. Skeletal muscle cells seem actively involved in the immune-inflammatory response and not only a target; understanding the molecular bases of IMs might help drug development strategies. Within muscles the interaction between the chemokine interferon (IFN)γ inducible 10kDa protein, CXCL10 or IP-10, and its specific receptor CXCR3, present on Th1 type infiltrating cells, likely plays a pivotal role, potentially offering the opportunity for therapeutic intervention. We aimed to clarify the involvement of human skeletal muscle cells in inflammatory processes in terms of CXCL10 secretion, to elucidate the engaged molecular mechanism(s) and, finally, to evaluate muscular cell responses, if any, to some immunosuppressants routinely used in IM treatment, such as methylprednisolone, methotrexate, cyclosporin A and Infliximab. We first isolated and characterized human fetal skeletal muscle cells (Hfsmc), which expressed the specific lineage markers and showed the competence to react in the context of an in vitro alloresponse. CXCL10 protein secretion by Hfsmc was similarly induced by the inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, above undetectable control levels, through the activation of Stat1 and NF-kB pathways, respectively; CXCL10 secretion was significantly magnified by cytokine combination, and this synergy was associated to a significant up-regulation of TNFαRII; cytokine-induced CXCL10 secretion was considerably affected only by Infliximab. Our data suggested that human skeletal muscle cells might actively self-promote muscular inflammation by eliciting CXCL10 secretion, which is known to amplify Th1 cell tissue infiltration in vivo. In conclusion, we sustain that pharmacological targeting of CXCL10 within muscular cells might contribute to keep in control pro-Th1 polarization of the immune/inflammatory response.

Abstract: The vanadate-induced increase in passive uptake of calcium and cobalt and their interference were studied in human red cells using 45Ca and 57Co as tracers. Vanadate is a potent inhibitor of the Ca-pump in red cells, although in fed cells a residual pump activity remains that is highly significant compared to the passive influx, and even in cells that are both ATP-depleted and vanadate-treated the pump arrest is not complete. In the presence of vanadate the Ca2+ uptake is increased due to inhibition of Ca-pump extrusion, but is further increased due to a vanadate-induced increment in passive influx. In order to measure the vanadate-induced increment in Ca2+ influx, the total uptake in vanadate-treated cells is corrected for the basal influx, as recorded in ATP-depleted cells in the presence of tetrathionate (5mM) that has been shown to eliminate the residual Ca-pump activity in ATP-depleted cells. The 57Co uptake is also increased by vanadate. 57Co is not transported by the Ca-pump, and hence the uptake in vanadate-treated cells can be directly compared to the basal uptake, both in fed and in ATP-depleted cells. The vanadate effect shows rapid onset and appears to be irreversible. The vanadate-induced increment in uptake of both 45Ca and 57Co is reduced by about 50% in ATP-depleted cells compared to fed cells, suggesting a metabolism- or SH-group-dependent component. The influx of both 45Ca (in ATP-depleted cells) and 57Co (in fed cells) increases with the vanadate concentration, with a similar K½ (0.4 and 0.3mM, respectively), and is nearly maximal at 5mM vanadate. The vanadate-induced increment in influx of both 45Ca and 57Co increases with the extracellular concentration as a saturable function, with K½ estimated at, respectively, 700 and 80μM. In the case of 57Co K½ is similar in fed and in ATP-depleted cells. The vanadate-induced uptake of 45Ca and of 57Co shows interference. The uptake of 45Ca is inhibited by Co2+, and the uptake of 57Co is inhibited by Ca2+, although with an unexplained time course. The vanadate-induced uptake of 45Ca and 57Co are both inhibited, and to a similar degree, by the 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+-channel blocker nifedipine, although only at concentrations much higher than IC50 for classical Ca-channels. The vanadate-induced increment in 57Co uptake is electroneutral, in contrast to the basal uptake that is at least partially electrogenic. In experiments with resealed ghosts a vanadate-induced 57Co uptake could not be detected. The vanadate-induced increment in 57Co uptake amounts to nearly half the increment in 45Ca uptake, both in fed and in ATP-depleted cells. It is speculated that the vanadate-induced Ca2+ and Co2+ uptake could be mediated by a putative common transporter, which appears to be separate and distinct from the putative common transporter for basal Ca2+ and Co2+ uptake.

Abstract: Background
Cryostorage of red blood cells (RBCs) represents a valid alternative to liquid storage, since units can be preserved safely for at least a decade while conserving RBC viability. While cryostorage has attracted a great deal of attention clinically, little is known about the biochemistry and physiology of cryostored erythrocyte concentrates.
Study design and method
In the present study, we investigated cryostorage of RBCs through monitoring of cell processing steps (from fresh blood, to glycerolization, thawing and deglycerolization/washing) through repeated assays of standard parameters (MCV, RDW-SD) and scanning electron microscopy.
Results
Cell processing for cryostorage resulted in increased RBC volumes. Shape alterations caused an increase in osmotic fragility and permeability to ions. A significant pH drop was observed which could not to be attributed to a higher metabolic rate, since the levels of lactate did not show substantial fluctuation during the cell processing steps tested in this study. Membrane anomalies are likely related to the hemolysis observed which preferentially affected the densest and oldest cell sub-populations, as confirmed by means of discontinuous density gradients.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that cryostorage itself in presence of glycerol does not significantly affect RBCs. Most of the alterations observed were related to cell processing and, in particular, to the increase of cytosolic glycerol as a consequence of the glycerolyzation step. Further studies might profitably investigate replacing glycerol with non-penetrating cryoprotectants.

Abstract: The Gilbert syndrome is a benign form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, mainly associated with alterations in UGT1A1 gene. This work investigated the effect of UGT1A1 variants on total bilirubin levels in Gilbert patients (n=45) and healthy controls (n=161). Total bilirubin levels were determined using a colorimetric method; molecular analysis of exons 1–5 and two UGT1A1 promoter regions were performed by direct sequencing and automatic analysis of fragments. Five in silico methods predicted the effect of new identified variants. A significant different allelic distribution, in Gilbert patients and in controls, was found for two promoter polymorphisms. Among patients, 82.2% were homozygous and 17.8% heterozygous for the c.−41_−40dupTA allele; in control group, 9.9% were homozygous and 43.5% heterozygous for this promoter variant, while 46.6% (n=75) presented the [A(TA)6TAA]. For the T>G transition at c.−3279 promoter region, in patients, 86.7% were homozygous and 13.3% heterozygous; in control group, 33.5% were homozygous for the wild type allele, 44.1% were heterozygous and 22.4% homozygous for the mutated allele. The two polymorphisms were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in both groups. Sequencing of UGT1A1 coding region identified nine novel variants, five in patients and four in controls. In silico analysis of these amino acids replacements predicted four of them as benign and three as damaging. In conclusion, we demonstrated that total bilirubin levels are mainly determined by the TA duplication in the TATA-box promoter and by the c.−3279T>G variant. Alterations in the UGT1A1 coding region seem to be associated with increased bilirubin levels, and, therefore, with Gilbert syndrome.

Abstract: Animals construct a layered skin to prevent dehydration and pathogen entrance. The barrier function of the skin relies on the extensive cross-linking of specialised components. In insects, for instance, epidermal cells produce an apical extracellular cuticle that consists of a network of proteins, chitin and lipids. We have identified mutations in the Drosophila gene coding for the δ-aminolevulinate synthase (Alas) that cause massive water loss. The cuticle of alas mutant larvae detaches from the epidermis and its basal region is frayed suggesting that an Alas dependent pathway is needed to organise the contact between the cuticle and the epidermis and anchor the cuticle to the apical surface of epidermal cells. Concomitantly, reduction of Alas function results in weakening of the extracellular dityrosines network in the cuticle, whereas glutamyl–lysine isopeptide bonds are not affected. The lateral septate junctions of epidermal cells that serve as a paracellular plug are intact, as well. Taken together, we hypothesise that Alas activity, which initiates heme biosynthesis in the mitochondrion, is needed for the formation of a dityrosine-based barrier that confers resistance to the internal hydrostatic pressure protecting both the cuticle from transcellular infiltration of body fluid and the animal from dehydration. We conclude that at least two modules – an apical protein–chitin lattice and the lateral septate junctions, act in parallel to ensure Drosophila skin impermeability.

Abstract: Autosomal dominant overhydrated cation-leak stomatocytosis in humans has been associated with missense mutations in the erythroid membrane transport genes AE1, RhAG, and GLUT1. Syndromic stomatocytosis has been reported in three dog breeds, but stomatocytosis in Standard Schnauzers is usually asymptomatic, and is accompanied by minimal if any anemia. We have extended the evaluation of a cohort of schnauzers. We found that low-level stomatocytosis was accompanied by increased MCV and increased red cell Na content, and minimal or no reticulocytosis. Red cells from two affected dogs exhibited increased currents in on-cell patches measured in symmetrical NaCl solutions, but Na,K-ATPase and NKCC-mediated cation flux was minimal. Three novel coding polymorphisms found in canine RhAG cDNA and three novel polymorphisms found in canine SLC4A1 cDNA did not cosegregate with MCV or Na content. The GLUT1 cDNA sequence was normal. We conclude that unlike human overhydrated cation-leak stomatocytosis, stomatocytosis in this cohort of Standard Schnauzers is not caused by mutations in the genes encoding RhAG, SLC4A1, or GLUT1.

Abstract: IL-6/gp130 dependent signaling plays an important role in modulating inflammation in acute and chronic diseases. The course of Concanavalin A- (Con A) induced hepatitis can be modulated by different immune-mediated mechanisms. IL-6/gp130-dependent signaling has been shown to be protective in hepatocytes. However, the role of this pathway in myeloid cells has not yet been studied. In our present study we used macrophage/neutrophil-specific gp130 knockout (gp130ΔLys, KO) animals and analyzed its relevance in modulating Con A-induced hepatitis. Additionally, we performed in vitro studies with gp130ΔLys-macrophages. We demonstrate that gp130ΔLys animals are more susceptible to Con A-induced hepatitis. This is reflected by higher transaminases, higher lethality and more severe liver injury as shown by histological staining. Using flow cytometry analysis we further could show that increased liver injury of gp130ΔLys animals is associated with a stronger infiltration of CD11b/F4/80 double-positive cells compared to wild-type (gp130flox/flox, WT) controls. To further characterize our observations we studied thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from gp130ΔLys animals. Interestingly, the LPS-dependent IL-6 release in gp130ΔLys macrophages is significantly reduced (p<0.05) compared to WT macrophages. Additionally, IL-6 blood levels in vivo after Con A injection were significantly lower in gp130ΔLys animals compared to WT animals (p<0.05). In summary, our results suggest that gp130-deletion in macrophages and granulocytes leads to diminished IL-6 release from these cells, which is associated with more severe Con A-induced hepatitis.

Abstract: Hemoglobin (Hb) E (β26 Glu→Lys) is the most common abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) variant in the world. Homozygotes for HbE are mildly thalassemic as a result of the alternate splice mutation and present with a benign clinical picture (microcytic and mildly anemic) with rare clinical symptoms. Given that the human red blood cell (RBC) contains both HbE and excess α-chains along with minor hemoglobins, the consequence of HbE alone on RBC pathophysiology has not been elucidated. This becomes critical for the highly morbid βE-thalassemia disease. We have generated transgenic mice exclusively expressing human HbE (HbEKO) that exhibit the known aberrant splicing of βE globin mRNA, but are essentially non-thalassemic as demonstrated by RBC α/β (human) globin chain synthesis. These mice exhibit hematological characteristics similar to presentations in human EE individuals: microcytic RBC with low MCV and MCH but normal MCHC; target RBC; mild anemia with low Hb, HCT and mildly elevated reticulocyte levels and decreased osmotic fragility, indicating altered RBC surface area to volume ratio. These alterations are correlated with a mild RBC oxidative stress indicated by enhanced membrane lipid peroxidation, elevated zinc protoporphyrin levels, and by small but significant changes in cardiac function. The C57 (background) mouse and full KO mouse models expressing HbE with the presence of HbS or HbA are used as controls. In select cases, the HbA full KO mouse model is compared but found to be limited due to its RBC thalassemic characteristics. Since the HbEKO mouse RBC lacks an abundance of excess α-chains that would approximate a mouse thalassemia (or a human thalassemia), the results indicate that the observed in vivo RBC mild oxidative stress arises, at least in part, from the molecular consequences of the HbE mutation.

Abstract: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a human disease caused by reduced levels of the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, leading to progressive loss of motor neurons and muscular paralysis. However, it is still not very clear why these cells are specifically sensitive to SMN levels. Therefore, understanding which proteins may functionally interact with SMN in a neuronal context is a very important issue. PPP4R2, a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4C), was previously identified as a functional interactor of the SMN complex, but has never been studied in neuronal cells. In this report, we show that PPP4R2 displays a very dynamic intracellular localization in mouse and rat neuronal cell lines and in rat primary hippocampal neurons, strongly correlating with differentiation. More importantly, we found that PPP4R2 loss of function impairs the differentiation of the mouse motor-neuronal cell line NSC-34, an effect that can be counteracted by SMN overexpression. In addition, we show that PPP4R2 may specifically protect NSC-34 cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis and that it is capable to functionally cooperate with SMN in this activity. Our data indicate that PPP4R2 is a SMN partner that may modulate the differentiation and survival of neuronal cells.

Abstract: In dendritic cells (DCs) cysteine cathepsins play a key role in antigen processing, invariant chain (Ii) cleavage and regulation of cell adhesion after maturation stimuli. Cystatin F, a cysteine protease inhibitor, is present in DCs in endosomal/lysosomal vesicles and thus has a potential to modulate cathepsin activity. In immature DCs cystatin F colocalizes with cathepsin S. After induction of DC maturation however, it is translocated into lysosomes and colocalizes with cathepsin L. The inhibitory potential of cystatin F depends on the properties of the monomer. We showed that the full-length monomeric cystatin F was a 12-fold stronger inhibitor of cathepsin S than the N-terminally processed cystatin F, whereas no significant difference in inhibition was observed for cathepsins L, H and X. Therefore, the role of cystatin F in regulating the main cathepsin S function in DCs, i.e. the processing of Ii, may depend on the form of the monomer present in endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. On the other hand, intact and truncated monomeric cystatin F are both potent inhibitors of cathepsin L and it is likely that cystatin F could regulate its activity in maturing, adherent DCs, controlling the processing of procathepsin X, which promotes cell adhesion via activation of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) integrin receptor.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to analyze the potential role of NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in amoeboid morphology and invasiveness of cancer cells. In the highly metastatic amoeboid cell lines A3 and A375M2, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of NG2 induced an amoeboid-mesenchymal transition associated with decreased invasiveness in 3D collagen and inactivation of the GTPase Rho. Conversely, the expression of NG2 in mesenchymal sarcoma K2 cells as well as in A375M2 cells resulted in an enhanced amoeboid phenotype associated with increased invasiveness and elevated Rho-GTP levels. Remarkably, the amoeboid-mesenchymal transition in A375M2 cells triggered by NG2 down-regulation was associated with increased extracellular matrix-degrading ability, although this was not sufficient to compensate for the decreased invasive capability caused by down-regulated Rho/ROCK signaling. Conversely, in K2 cells with overexpression of NG2, the ability to degrade the extracellular matrix was greatly reduced. Taken together, we suggest that NG2-mediated activation of Rho leading to effective amoeboid invasiveness is a possible mechanism through which NG2 could contribute to tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

Abstract: Talins are adaptor proteins that connect the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors to cytoskeletal actin. Vertebrates express two closely related talins encoded by separate genes, and while it is well established that talin1 plays a key role in cell adhesion and spreading, little is known about the role of talin2. To facilitate such studies, we report the characterisation of 4 new isoform-specific talin mouse monoclonal antibodies that work in Western blotting, immuno-precipitation, immuno-fluorescence and immuno-histochemistry. Using these antibodies, we show that talin1 and talin2 do not form heterodimers, and that they are differentially localised within the cell. Talin1 was concentrated in peripheral focal adhesions while talin2 was observed in both focal and fibrillar adhesions, and knock-down of talin2 compromised fibronectin fibrillogenesis. Although differentiated human macrophages express both isoforms, only talin1 showed discrete staining and was localised to the ring structure of podosomes. However, siRNA-mediated knock-down of macrophage talin2 led to a significant reduction in podosomal matrix degradation. We have also used the antibodies to localise each isoform in tissue sections using both cryostat and paraffin-embedded material. In skeletal muscle talin2 was localised to both myotendinous junctions and costameres while talin1 was restricted to the former structure. In contrast, both isoforms co-localised in kidney with staining of the glomerulus, and the tubular epithelial and interstitial cells of the cortex and medulla. We anticipate that these antibodies will form a valuable resource for future studies on the function of the two major talin isoforms.

Abstract: Recognition of external mechanical signals by cells is an essential process for life. One important mechanical signal experienced by various cell types, e.g. around blood vessels, within the lung epithelia or around the intestine, is cyclic stretch. As a response, many cell types reorient their actin cytoskeleton and main cell axis almost perpendicular to the direction of stretch. Despite the vital necessity of cellular adaptation to cyclic stretch, the underlying mechanosensory signal cascades are far from being understood. Here we show an important function of Src-family kinase activity in cellular reorientation upon cyclic stretch. Deletion of all three family members, namely c-Src, Yes and Fyn (SYF), results in a strongly impaired cell reorientation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with an only incomplete reorientation upon expression of c-Src. We further demonstrate that this reorientation phenotype of SYF-depleted cells is not caused by affected protein exchange dynamics within focal adhesions or altered cell force generation. Instead, Src-family kinases regulate the reorientation in a mechanotransduction-dependent manner, since knock-down and knock-out of p130Cas, a putative stretch sensor known to be phosphorylated by Src-family kinases, also reduce cellular reorientation upon cyclic stretch. This impaired reorientation is identical in intensity upon mutating stretch-sensitive tyrosines of p130Cas only. These statistically highly significant data pinpoint early events in a Src family kinase- and p130Cas-dependent mechanosensory/mechanotransduction pathway.

Abstract: The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPα) is involved in the regulation of tyrosine kinases like the Src kinase and the insulin receptor. As with other PTPs, its function is determined by alternative splicing, dimerisation, phosphorylation and proteolytical processing. PTPα is cleaved by calpain in its intracellular domain, which decreases its potential to dephosphorylate Src kinase. Here, we demonstrate that PTPα is also processed in the extracellular domain. Extracellular processing was exclusively found for a splice variant containing an extra nine amino acid insert three residues amino-terminal from the transmembrane domain. Processing was sensitive to the metalloprotease-inhibitor Batimastat, and CHO-M2 cells lacking a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17; tumor-necrosis-factor α converting enzyme) activity were not able to cleave PTPα. After transient overexpression of ADAM17 and PTPα in these cells, processing was restored, proving that ADAM17 is involved in this process. Further characterization of the consequences of processing revealed that dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor or activation of Src was not affected but focus formation was reduced. We conclude that extracellular proteolytic processing is a novel mechanism for PTPα regulation.

Abstract: The quality check of PV-plants under certain operating conditions by employing infrared-imaging has acquired significance during the last years. In order to prove the reliability of these techniques in terms of power loss, life time, critical temperatures and failure mechanisms, fifteen PV-plants were investigated in detail. In total, about 260 dismantled modules were analyzed by power measurements as well as electroluminescence and IR-thermography. Apart from revealing the reliability of this technique, the evaluated data manifest various failure mechanisms, like cell fracture, deficient solder joints, short-circuited cells and bypassed substrings. The impact of these frequently detected defects on the resulting temperature, the IV-curve and the power output is discussed. Finally, differing defects can be diagnosed by characteristic temperature differences. In conclusion, the reliability and usefulness of infrared-mapping of PV-plants were proved with the result, that all modules having cells with increased temperature show remarkably reduced power output.

Abstract: The erythrocyte membrane has been extensively studied, both as a model membrane system and to investigate its role in gas exchange and transport. Much is now known about the protein components of the membrane, how they are organised into large multi-protein complexes and how they interact with each other within these complexes. Many links between the membrane and the cytoskeleton have also been delineated and have been demonstrated to be crucial for maintaining the deformability and integrity of the erythrocyte. In this study we have refined previous, highly speculative molecular models of these complexes by including the available data pertaining to known protein–protein interactions. While the refined models remain highly speculative, they provide an evolving framework for visualisation of these important cellular structures at the atomic level.
