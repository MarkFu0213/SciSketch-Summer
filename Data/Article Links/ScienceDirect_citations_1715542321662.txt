Abstract: We demonstrate that based on a post-sulphurization approach the mean sulphur concentration and bandgap of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell absorber layers can be precisely controlled. However, X-ray diffraction and secondary ion mass spectrometry studies reveal an inhomogeneous sulphur incorporation at lower process temperatures resulting in a sulphur gradient in the absorber. Optimization of such gradients may enable further performance improvement of future devices. During the post-sulphurization process sulphur seems to accumulate at the back of the absorber first where there is already an enrichment of sulphur in the purely selenized absorbers. With higher temperatures more sulphur gets incorporated and the sulphur distribution gets evened out. Morphology studies show that the process of exchanging the chalcogenides leaves behind holes and results in a porous absorber layer. With higher process temperatures and therefore higher sulphur content the absorber gets more dense. The device performance of the post-sulphurized samples increases significantly with increasing process temperature and increasing sulphur content.

Abstract: A semi-interpenetrating network including branched poly(ethylene oxide), nitrile butadiene rubber, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) used for infrared electroemissive device applications has been investigated using a screening of various ionic liquids based on imidazolium, piperidinium and pyridinium cations and fluorosulfonimide, trifluoromethane sulfonimide and tetrafluoroborate anions. Prior to device characterization and in order to have a better understanding of the influence of these ionic liquids on PEDOT-based devices, PEDOT films have been first synthetized by galvanostatic method. Cyclic voltammetry in 3-electrodes configuration of PEDOT layers in the whole set of ionic liquids have demonstrated a significant role of the cation in the redox process. In the case of the devices, the ionic mechanism has been identified by a simple and fast method consisting in studying the volume change of the PEDOT active layer. Among the 8 ionic liquids studied, 7 of them have shown the cation as the predominant mobile specie while, for one of them, both anions and cations were predominantly mobile species depending on time constant. Electrochemical, ionic conductivity and IR-optical properties of the devices swollen with the different ionic liquids have been then investigated. The devices behave in a similar manner both electrochemically and optically. Reflectivity contrasts can reach 27% over a wavelength range of 2.5–20µm, demonstrating the potential efficiency of such devices for thermal regulation of satellites in a space environment.

Abstract: To optimize the optical response of a solar cell, specifically designed materials with appropriate optoelectronic properties are needed. Owing to the unique microstructure of doped nanocrystalline silicon oxide, nc-SiOx:H, this material is able to cover an extensive range of optical and electrical properties. However, applying nc-SiOx:H thin-films in photovoltaic devices necessitates an individual adaptation of the material properties according to the specific functions in the device. In this study, we investigated the detailed microstructure of doped nc-SiOx:H films via atom probe tomography at the sub-nm scale, thereby, for the first time, revealing the three-dimensional distribution of the nc-Si network. Furthermore, n- and p-type nc-SiOx:H layers with various optical and electrical properties were implemented as a window, back contact, and an intermediate reflector layer in silicon heterojunction and multi-junction thin-film solar cells with a focus on the key aspects for adapting the material properties to the specific functions. Here, nc-SiOx:H effectively reduced the parasitic absorption and opened new possibilities for the photon management in the solar cells, thereby, demonstrating the versatility of this material. Remarkably, using our adapted nc-SiOx:H layers in distinct functions enabled us to achieve a combined short circuit current density of 15.1mAcm−2 for the two a-Si:H sub-cells in an a-Si:H/a-Si:H/µc-Si:H triple-junction thin-film solar cell and an active area efficiency of 21.4% was realized for a silicon heterojunction solar cell.

Abstract: High-quality Cu2O nanowire (NW) photocathode was successfully fabricated upon annealing Cu(OH)2 NW precursor. The precursor was prepared via a wet chemical oxidation method [Cu foil + (NH4)2S2O8 + NaOH] which is always accompanied with unfavourable nanostructured CuO. However, the present study has synthesized the precursor without the emergence of CuO with modified growth solution at room temperature. Under proper growth condition, the height and width of pure, vertically erected Cu(OH)2 NW has increased proportionally to the ageing time for growing NW. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement of Cu2O NW under 100 mW cm−2 light irradiation and 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution, has generated − 5.45 mA cm−2 at − 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The high photocurrent density was attributed to the high carrier density (2.69 × 1021 cm−3) accompanied with a low charge transfer resistant under illumination. The inexpensive and highly scalable Cu2O NW is a promising photocathode for PEC solar to energy application.

Abstract: Background
The increased survival rate of thalassemic patients has led to unmasking of management related complications which were infrequently encountered.
Objective
Study the increased coagulation and platelet activation in children with β-thalassemia, to analyze the factors that lead to such hypercoagulable state and to study pulmonary hypertension (PH) in conjunction with platelet activation and hypercoagulable state in children with β-thalassemia.
Methods
36 Egyptian children with β-thalassemia with a mean age of 9.9years (±4.7 SD). In addition, 20 healthy Egyptian children matched for age and sex were enrolled as a control group. Both were subjected to clinical and laboratory assessments. Echocardiography was done to the patient group and PH was diagnosed based on calculated mean pulmonary artery pressure [MPAP] >25mmHg.
Results
We found that, mean±SD serum P-selectin level (platelet activator marker) was significantly higher in thalassemic patients (2337±566pg/ml) in comparison to controls (1467±247pg/ml) (P<0.001). Mean serum protein-C and antithrombin-III levels were significantly lower in thalassemic patients (1.2±1.3µg/ml, 27.3±7.5mg/dl) in comparison to controls (2.3±1.3µg/ml, 35.1±4.1mg/dl) (P=0.003 and <0.001) respectively. PH was detected in 17 (47.2%) patients and it was significantly associated with splenectomy (P=0.01) and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT) (P=0.04). PH was positively correlated with serum levels of P-selectin (r=0.38, P=0.02), fibrinogen (r=0.41, P=0.01) and negatively correlated with serum protein-C level (r=−0.48, P=0.003).
Conclusion
A chronic hypercoagulable state and platelet activation is present in children with β-thalassemia. Splenectomy and transfusion infrequency are the main risk factors noted to be associated with such hypercoagulable state and platelet activation and consequently the PH among our thalassemic patients.

Abstract: Exploration of low-temperature solution-processed methodology for fabricating planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is meaningful for simplifying manufacturing, roll-to-roll industrial mass production on flexible substrates and designing perovskite tandem devices. However, some complicated, time consuming, or even high-cost methodologies such as atomic layer deposition, magnetron sputtering, and utilizing careful interface engineering are still needed for preparing efficient planar PSCs with TiO2 electron transport layers (ETLs) at low temperature. Here, we report a simple ligand-exchange strategy to overcome the problems. We use oleic acid (OA) molecules as surface ligands for synthesis well crystalline and monodisperse TiO2 nanocrystals. Subsequently, instead of high temperature decomposition, we find that the ligand-exchange strategy can also totally peel off these insulating ligands on the TiO2 nanocrystal surfaces and form high-quality TiO2 ETLs at low temperature. The OA-free TiO2 ETLs prepared at 150°C show high conductivity, fast electron extraction and transport speeds, low series resistance and high shunt resistance in the assembled PSCs, contributing to high performance devices with slight hysteresis and good reproducibility.

Abstract: We report on the effect of thermal annealing on the microstructure, optical properties and wettability of TiO2-based water-splitting (WS) composite using full solar spectrum as source of energy. The WS material used in this study is composed of three layers (SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2) on top of which a distribution of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance structures such as gold are formed to obtain a multilayer composite material. The fabricated samples are then annealed at 450−1100°C temperatures range under atmospheric conditions. The crystal structure and chemical composition are determined using X-ray Diffractometer, Scanning Electron Microscope, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, High Resolution Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscope. UV–Vis spectroscopy is used to study the influence of thermal annealing on optical absorption. Besides, wettability alteration is assessed using both in-situ (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope) and ex-situ (sessile drop technique). Our findings reveal that thermal annealing leads to the transformation of amorphous TiO2 to its more stable phase anatase. This transformation enhances significantly the optical properties and increases the hydrophilicity of the material surface making it suitable for WS activity. More importantly, the presence of plasmonic nanostructures allow the material to extend its photoactivity from UV region to full solar spectrum. The gold nanocrystals were also found to prefer the <111> orientation during their evolving and growth after thermal annealing. This specific compact orientation is also reported to increase the efficiency of WS.

Abstract: Scalable sheet-to-sheet slot die coating processes have been demonstrated for perovskite solar cells and modules. The processes have been developed on 6in. × 6in. glass/ITO substrates for two functional layers: the perovskite photo-active layer and the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer. Perovskite solar cells produced using these slot die coating processes demonstrate device performances identical to the spin coated devices. All manufactured devices illustrate a high level of reproducibility. The developed slot die coating processes were also used for the manufacturing of perovskite PV modules. Large area modules of 12.5 × 13.5cm2 were realized by slot die coating on 6in. × 6in. substrates in combination with newly developed laser ablation processes for conventional P1-P2-P3 monolithic cell interconnections. The modules demonstrate power conversion efficiencies above 10%, with a power output of 1.7W. This achievement is an important milestone in the development of up-scalable manufacturing technologies for perovskite PV modules.

Abstract: Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 is an attractive earth-abundant material for low-cost thin film photovoltaics with the capability to achieve power production in the terawatt range and therefore to supply a significant part of the global electricity needs. Despite its advantageous optical and electrical properties for photovoltaic applications, the large band tailing causes voltage losses that limit the efficiency of kesterite-based devices. Here we show that the band-tailing originates mainly from band-gap fluctuations attributable to chemical composition variations at nanoscale; while electrostatic fluctuations play a lesser role. Absorption measurement reveal that the Cu-Zn disorder, always present in kesterite Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4, is not the main source of the large band tailing. Instead defect clusters having a significant impact on the band-edge energies, e.g. [2CuZn−+SnZn2+], are proposed as the main origin for the kesterite band tail.

Abstract: Up to now many efforts have been put into environmentally friendly techniques for designing high quality selective absorbers to take advantage of the abundant and clean solar energy sources. In this paper a new selective absorber for low temperature thermal applications is presented. It is a multilayered absorber, specifically a three layer configuration, with only one layer of absorber material. It is composed of CuMnOx thin film and two consecutive antireflective coatings: FeMnCuOx and SiO2. The CuMnOx film and the FeMnCuOx antireflective layer were prepared from alcoholic solutions containing metal nitrates while the solution used to prepare the SiO2 coating was prepared from silicon alkoxides. The deposition of the three layers onto the aluminum substrate achieves solar absorptance values of 0.957 and thermal emittance values of 0.038 at 100 °C. In this way, it is obtained a very good selective absorber with three layers configuration by using a simple, reproducible and cost-effective method such as dip coating.

Abstract: Introducing oxygen vacancies is an effective strategy to tail the absorption band-edge of ZrO2 photocatalyst into visible-light region and modifying its surface feature can promote the adsorption affinity toward organic molecules, resulting in the enhancement of visible-light photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Herein, we prepared mesoporous ZrO2 with rich oxygen vacancy through a template-free solvothermal method followed by an annealing process, which was used as a catalyst to photodegrade tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). The photocatalytic performance was found to be dependent on both oxygen vacancies and adsorption affinity. Comprehensive analysis revealed that, despite a certain reduction in both specific surface area and the amount of charged oxygen vacancy after annealing at 350 °C in air, the increased adsorption affinity toward TCH could promote its visible-light photocatalytic properties, along with good recyclability. Finally, a possible pathway and mechanism for the degradation of TCH was proposed.

Abstract: VO2 has attracted extensive attention as an adaptive camouflage material due to its structural change during the metal-insulator transition (MIT) at 68°C, which can fast respond to ambient temperature and actively modulate infrared emissivity. However, the thermal instability and undesirable color have restricted its applications in multi-spectral camouflage. In this study, the VO2/ZnS core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized via a homogeneous precipitation method. The VO2 nanoparticle core exhibited a remarkable infrared emissivity modulation ability in the mid-wavelength and long-wavelength thermal atmospheric windows. The ZnS shell, as an infrared transparent material, not only modified the color of VO2 nanoparticle from unpleasant blue-black to gray-green that adapts to visible camouflage in the woodland background, but also significantly enhanced the oxidation resistance. This is the first report of such a single nanoparticle structure with both variable infrared emissivity and desirable color that offer significant potential for multi-spectral camouflage application.

Abstract: The development of high efficient materials or devices for storage and utilization of sustainable thermal energy should be of great importance in alleviating energy crisis. Herein, we reported the fabrication of superwetting polypropylene (PP) aerogel as the support materials for construction of form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) composites. Due to its abundant porosity, light weight of aerogel in nature, inherent superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties, lipophilic organic PCMs can be loaded into PP aerogel (PP/PCM) with a high PCMs loading of up to 1060wt%, which is nearly two orders of magnitudes higher than those mostly reported form-stable PCMs systems. The PP/PCM composites show high latent heat in the range of 141.1kJkg−1 to 159.5kJkg−1 and excellent thermal stability and recyclability where their latent heat nearly remains unchanged even after 50 times of melting/freezing cycles. Results obtained from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) show that the incorporation of organic PCMs into PP aerogel network decreases the crystal size of PCMs in the composites. More interestingly, the PP/PCM composites show an enhanced thermal conductivity, in the case of PP/Paraffin composite, which is over two times of that of paraffin. Having the advantages of low cost and abundant resource of PP, simple preparatory process, high PCMs loading, good stability, recyclability and thermal conductivity, this the PP/PCM composites may have great potential for renewable energy saving applications.

Abstract: High-performance transparent heaters were fabricated on glass substrate using spray coating the solution processed single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Transparent heaters were treated with acid and alcohol mixture (10:1) to display high heating performance. The post treated SWCNT heater with 81% transmittance at 550nm reached a steady-state temperature of 424K with a heating rate of 0.6K/s when 60V is applied. The enhancement of electrothermal performance was studied in terms of heating rate, input power density and applied voltage. The enhanced heating performance attributed due to the effective wetting of the SWCNT network which intern reduce the sheet resistance of the conducting films. Defrosters realized using the post treated heater able to remove frost within a minute when 30V was applied. The excellent power dependent heating performance with high stability indicates that the SWCNT heaters can be used in the temperature controlled heaters, smart windows and defrosters.

Abstract: Solar cells employing quantum wells can enhance the light absorption but suffer from the difficulty in photocarrier extraction. Here, we analyzed the spectral response and the photocarrier collection mechanism of p-i-n multiple quantum well (MQW) solar cells using the effective-mobility model. Both the simulation and experimental results imply that the spatial profiles of electron and hole densities in MQWs play an important role in the carrier collection process. By considering the recombination increment under illumination, our findings suggest that the concept of the majority/minority carriers is important even in the intrinsic region: photogenerated electrons and holes only experience significant recombination when passing through the hole-rich and electron-rich regions, respectively. This can accurately explain the photocurrent behavior in cells with background doping, background illumination, and different MQW positions. Based on the experimental findings, we derived analytical formulae for carrier collection efficiency, which directly show the impact of each cell parameter and can be used for the systematic cell design.

Abstract: Insulin signaling is essential for regulating glucose homeostasis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect insulin signaling, and low ROS levels can act as a signal to regulate cellular function. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are highly abundant and widely expressed antioxidant enzymes. However, it is unclear whether antioxidant enzymes, such as Prx2, mediate insulin signaling. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of Prx2 deficiency on insulin signaling. Our western blot results showed that Prx2 deficiency enhanced insulin signaling and increased oxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with insulin. In addition, we assessed ROS levels with a Cytosol-HyPer H2O2 sensor. As a result, increased ROS levels and Akt activation were decreased by N-acetyl-cysteine (Nac), which acted as an antioxidant in Prx2-deficient MEFs. Body weight measurements and glucose tolerance test (GTT) revealed significant body weight reduction and increase in glucose clearance in Prx2-/- mice fed a high-fat diet. Interestingly, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) was significantly higher in Prx2-/- mice than in wild-type mice according to western blotting results. Western blotting also revealed that Akt phosphorylation was higher in Prx2-/- MEFs and muscle tissue than in wild-type. Together, our findings indicate that increased ROS due to Prx2 deficiency promotes insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance in skeletal muscles by increasing protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) oxidation. These results provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of insulin signaling induced by Prx2 deficiency and suggest that ROS-based therapeutic strategies can be used to suppress insulin resistance.

Abstract: Applying materials with complementary optical absorption spectra to construct tandem solar cell can fulfill further improvement of photovoltaic performance, since tandem solar cell can harvest more photons and enhance the open-circuit voltage of the devices. For tandem solar cells, an interconnecting layer (ICL), which physically and electrically connects the front and the rear subcells, is essential to minimize the energy losses. Herein, we adopt MoO3/Ag/PFN-Br as interconnecting layer to join front subcell of PBDTBDD:PC70BM and rear subcell of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F for construction the inverted tandem solar cell with structure of ITO/TIPD/PBDTBDD:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag/PFN-Br/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/MoO3/Al. The tandem devices demonstrate strong and wide light response in the wavelength between 300 and 1000 nm. A promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.74% has been achieved with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.503 V. The PCE of tandem cell is 41.36% higher than that (6.89%) of front subcell and 27.82% higher than that (7.62%) of rear subcell.

Abstract: Two strategies for enhancing photovoltaic (PV) performance in chalcopyrite solar cells were investigated: Cu1−xKxIn1−yGaySe2 absorbers with low K content (K/(K+Cu), or x ~ 0.07) distributed throughout the bulk, and CuIn1−yGaySe2 absorbers with KIn1−yGaySe2 grown on their surfaces. Distributing K throughout the bulk absorbers improved power conversion efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) for Ga/(Ga+In) of 0, 0.3 and 0.5. Surface KIn1−yGaySe2 and bulk x ~ 0.07 Cu1−xKxIn1−yGaySe2 films with Ga/(Ga+In), or y of 0.3 and 0.5 also had improved efficiency, VOC, and FF, relative to CuIn1−yGaySe2 baselines. On the other hand, y ~ 1 absorbers did not benefit from K introduction. Similar to Cu1−xKxInSe2, the formation of Cu1−xKxGaSe2 alloys was favored at low temperatures and high Na supply by the substrate, relative to the formation of mixed-phase CuGaSe2 + KGaSe2. KIn1−yGaySe2 alloys were grown for the first time, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. For all Ga/(Ga+In) compositions, the surface KIn1−yGaySe2 absorbers had superior PV performance in buffered and buffer-free devices. However, the bulk x ~ 0.07 absorbers only outperformed the baselines in buffered devices. The data demonstrate that KIn1−yGaySe2 passivates the surface of CuIn1−yGaySe2 to increase efficiency, VOC, and FF, while bulk Cu1−xKxIn1−yGaySe2 absorbers with x ~ 0.07 enhance efficiency, VOC, and FF by some other mechanism.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSiS4 thin film has been synthesized using co-sputtering technique followed by sulphurization at 800°C for 20min. The relatively lower time of sulphurization employed are advantageous over earlier reported work in which the same material has been prepared in bulk form with a sulphurization time of ~ 24h. The structural, optical and electrical properties of Cu2ZnSiS4 have been studied using macroscopic and nanoscopic characterization methods. Raman results confirm the formation of Cu2ZnSiS4 phase and X-ray diffraction spectra shows that its diffraction pattern is similar to Sn based (Cu2ZnSnS4) kesterite phase. The direct band gap of this new material is found to be ~ 2.71eV. The conductivity-temperature analysis in the high temperature range (380K–150K) shows hopping conduction via defect states to be the conduction mechanism. The average work function of this material is 4.92eV and Kelvin probe force microscopy results show an upward band bending at grain boundaries in comparison to intra-grain. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the + 4 oxidation state of Si in the Cu2ZnSiS4 thin film sample. Further, results of Kelvin probe force microscopy, UV–visible and Ultra-voilet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements have been used to obtain energy band diagram of this new material which also reveal p-type semiconducting nature of the Cu2ZnSiS4 and indicate its usefulness as a photoelectrochemical material.

Abstract: Optical memory effect plays a critical role in energy-saving coefficient of electrochromic devices (ECDs). Due to the finite electron-blocking capacity of ions electrolyte layer and the weak interfacial energy between the ions electrolyte layer and electrochromic layers, typically five-layer inorganic all-solid-state ECDs generally suffer from poor optical memory. A seven-layer inorganic ECD with significantly improved optical memory is designed by means of the embedment of Ta2O5 layers between ions conductive layer and electrochromic layers. Compared with the typical five-layer ECD-1 (ITO/NiOx/LiNbO3/WO3/ITO), the seven-layer ECD-2 with the structure of ITO/NiOx/Ta2O5/LiNbO3/Ta2O5/WO3/ITO presents much less leakage current, larger optical modulation and higher coloration efficiency during electrochemical cycling. The further analyses reveal that the embedded Ta2O5 layers greatly increase the energy barrier between NiOx, WO3 and LiNbO3, imposing restrictions on the transfer kinetics of electrons contributing to the leakage current and enlarging the threshold potential available to ECD-2, which gives rise to a high coloration efficiency up to 98.0cm2C−1. Furthermore, the seven-layer ECD-2 maintains a stable optical modulation of approximately 52.5% for over 10,000 cycles, even though there is a compromise in response characteristic due to the Li+-ion trapping in electrochromic layers, which provides a further insight into the electrochromic degradation of inorganic all-solid-state complementary ECDs.

Abstract: Metal sulfide has the potential to take the place of high temperature sintered TiO2 as electron transportation layer for perovskite solar cell (PSC) with improved light stability and suppressed hysteresis. In this work, CdS films were used as independent or buffered electron transport layer for planar perovskite solar cell by a low-temperature RF sputtering method for the first time. The effects of surface roughness and optical absorption of CdS films on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs were discussed. The PSC with sputtered CdS film shows a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) and efficiency of 13.17% than high temperature sintered TiO2 ETL (12.71%). Moreover, a RF sputtered CdS buffer layer between TiO2 and perovskite could tune the conduction band edge of TiO2 and perovskite and passivating the surface defects. Time resolved photoluminescence results indicate the RF sputtered CdS film buffer layer could accelerate charge transportation and a higher conversion efficiency over 16% has thus been achieved, with enhanced air stability and minimized hysteresis. These findings offer new research directions for low-temperature sputtered metal sulfide film as a promising electron transport material for stable and high efficient planar perovskite solar cell.

Abstract: Metastastic breast cancer, especially triple-negative (TN), is one of the most common causes of cancer related deaths in women. Recent years, tumor-associate vessel formation is considered as a more generally and effective target to patient with malignant cancer. Our previous studies indicated that miR-19b-1 controls the intrinsic angiogenic activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. In this study, in silico analysis indicated VEZF1 that implicates in angiogenesis and triple-negative breast cancer progression might be the target of miR-19b-1. Further investigation showed that overexpressing miR-19b-1 in human triple-negative breast cancer cell line(MDA-MB-231) led to impaired angiogenic activity of HUVECs in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, miR-19b-1 upregulation inhibited the vessel imitation mediated by MDA-MB-231. Furthermore, enforced expression of miR-19b-1 in MDA-MB-231 has impact on HUVECs apoptosis and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential, which suggested the possible mechanism involved in interaction between breast cancer and endothelial cells. What’s more, we found that miR-19b-1 stable overexpression in MDA-MB-231 caused tumor growth arresting entirely. Besides, our results suggested that miR-19b-1 could inhibit angiogenesis by possibly targeting VEGF receptor endocytosis signaling pathway. Taking together, our findings suggest an important role of miR-19b-1 in crosstalk between metastatic breast cancer and endothelial cells and provide us new insights for exploring miR-19b-1 and its multiple targets as promising therapeutic candidates to interfere breast cancer progression.

Abstract: Fluorinated α-Fe2O3 nanostructures are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route using Selectfluor™ (F-TEDA) as a fluorinating as well as growth directing agent. The addition of incrementally increasing amount of F-TEDA to Fe precursor under hydrothermal conditions resulted in preferential growth of α-Fe2O3 along (110) orientation with respect to (104) direction by ~ 35%, the former being important for enhanced charge transport. On increasing fluorination, the heirarchical dendritic-type α-Fe2O3 changes to a snow-flake type structure (F-TEDA-20%) anisotropically growing along the six directions however, at higher F-TEDA concentrations (≥ 30%), loosely held particulate aggregates are seen to be formed. The X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) suggest the maximum fluorinarion of α-Fe2O3 at 1.21at% in 30% F-TEDA. Further, optical absorption studies reveal reduction in optical band gap from 2.10eV in case of pristine to 1.95eV for fluorinated α-Fe2O3. A photoanode made by taking 20% fluorinated α-Fe2O3 in a ratio of 10:90 with respect to TiO2 (P-25) showed improved performance in dye sensitized solar cells with an increase in efficiency by ~16% in comparision to that of pristine Fe2O3 and TiO2. Furthermore, anode consisting of thin films of fluorinated α-Fe2O3 on FTO also exhibit enhanced current density on illumination of ~100W/m2. The increase in photoelectrochemical activity seems to be due to the combination of two factors namely preferential growth of α-Fe2O3 along (110) direction resulting in an improved charge transfer efficiency and reduced recombination losses due to the presence of fluorine.

Abstract: A comprehensive phase diagram for the binary polyols system erythritol-xylitol has been mapped with a transparent characterization approach. Here, the phase equilibrium of the system has been studied experimentally using a combination of methods: Temperature-history (T-history), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), and linked to Tammann plots. Existing literature has previously shown the system to be a non-isomorphous type forming a simple eutectic, by combining experimental data with theoretical modelling. The present investigation shows that the system's phase diagram is a partially isomorphous type forming a eutectic, but not a non-isomorphous type forming a simple eutectic. Here, the eutectic was found within 25–30mol% erythritol and at 77°C, which differs from the previous studies identifying the eutectic respectively at 25 or 36mol% erythritol and at 82°C. The reasons for the differences are hard to deduce since the research approach is not presented as fully transparent from the past studies. In the present study, only the temperature-composition plot of the first melting (of the two components in a physical mix, but not of a single blend) indicated the shape of a simple eutectic in a non-isomorphous system. The cycles after the first melting in contrast started from the real blend, and displayed eutectic and solid-solid phase changes in T-history. These were verified as forming solid solutions with XRD and FESEM. This eutectic melts at a temperature suitable for low-temperature solar heating, but displayed glass transition, supercooling, and thermally activated degradation, thus affecting its practical aspects as a PCM.

Abstract: The daylighting performance of a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) switchable glazing has been evaluated using an unfurnished outdoor south-facing test cell with a glazing-to-wall ratio of 1:9. Useful daylight illuminance levels (UDI) were determined for clear sunny, intermittent cloudy and overcast cloudy days. Daylight glare indexes (DGIN) was calculated for the PDLC glazing in its transparent and translucent states. An electrically-actuated adaptive PDLC switchable glazing with transparency that varied between 27% and 71% was able to control daylight glare.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency and thalassemia are genetically independent hemolytic disorders. Co-inheritance of both disorders may affect red blood cell pathology to a greater extent than normally seen in either disorder alone. This study determines the prevalence and evaluates hematological changes of G-6-PD deficiency and thalassemia co-inheritance.
Methods
G-6-PD deficiency was screened from 200 male thalassemia blood samples using a fluorescent spot test. Hematological parameters and red blood cell morphology were evaluated among G-6-PD deficiency/thalassemia co-inheritance, G-6-PD deficiency alone, thalassemia alone, and normal individuals.
Results
G-6-PD deficiency was detected together with hemoglobin (Hb) E heterozygote, Hb E homozygote, β-thalassemia trait, and β-thalassemia/Hb E, α-thalassemia-2 trait, and Hb H disease. Hb level, hematocrit, mean cell volume, and mean cell Hb of G-6-PD deficiency co-inherited with asymptomatic thalassemia carriers show significantly lower mean values compared to carriers with only the same thalassemia genotypes. Higher mean red blood cell distribution width was observed in G-6-PD deficiency co-inherited with Hb E heterozygote, as with numbers of hemighost cells in G-6-PD deficiency/thalassemia co-inheritance compared to those with either disorder. Apart from Hb level, hematological parameters of co-inheritance disorders were not different from individuals with a single thalassemia disease.
Conclusion
G-6-PD deficiency co-inherited with thalassemia in males was present in 10% of the participants, resulting in worsening of red blood cell pathology compared with inheritance of thalassemia alone.

Abstract: A387 Gr 91 Cr-Mo alloy corrosion compatibility with LiOH-KOH mixture was evaluated at 315 °C (Test#1) and 360 °C (Test#2). This alloy is studied for a techno-economical optimization of a steam-PCM heat exchanger proposed in the thermal energy storage (TES) system of a direct steam generation (DSG) facility. The corrosion damage was analyzed with visual inspection, optical microscopy, SEM, EDS and XRD, and corrosion rates were also calculated. A387 Gr 91 alloy generates protective oxide layers over base metal. Localized corrosion damages were not detected with these test conditions, while XRD and EDS profiles showed CrO and LiFeO2 as main corrosion products generated by this alloy. On the other hand, corrosion rates decrease with exposure time showing the passivation of the alloy. A387 Gr 91 corrosion performance was compared with A316L stainless steel, which was preliminary proposed by the authors in previous studies. In addition to corrosion performance, parameters such as cost, thermal properties, and mechanical properties are discussed. In conclusion, the use of A387 Gr 91 instead to A316L alloy for the construction of the steam-PCM heat exchanger involves the techno-economical optimization of the equipment.

Abstract: In this work, we report on the design and synthesis of a new sulfonated polyaniline derivative containing thiol (-SH) groups (SPAN(SH)) to achieve effective dispersion of gold nanoparticles (GNP) into SPAN(SH) (SPAN(SH)@GNP). The photovoltaic performances of the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl): indene-C60 bisadduct (P3HT: ICBA) were evaluated to elucidate the associated roles of SPAN(SH)@GNP NH (nanohybrid) buffer layer in the polymer solar cell (PSC) device architecture: ITO (Indium Tin Oxide)/SPAN(SH) or SPAN(SH)@GNP(X%) NH/Zinc Oxide (ZnO)/Al. The use of SPAN(SH)@GNP buffer layer significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the fabricated PSC. Notably, buffer layer containing 1.66wt% of GNP with respect to the weight of SPAN(SH), (ITO/SPAN(SH)@GNP(1.66%)/P3HT: ICBA/ZnO/Al) exhibited an excellent improvement in the PCE (5.20%), which is much higher than that of the PCE (4.25%) with SPAN(SH) (ITO/SPAN(SH)/P3HT: ICBA/ZnO/Al). It has been demonstrated that the very strong near field of the GNP not only distributes laterally in the buffer layer but also vertically extends into the adjacent P3HT: ICBA (active) layer yielding an enhanced exciton generation in the active layer. The synergistic effects of energy level alignment, decreased interfacial resistance, effective hole extraction and increased surface area between the buffer/active layer, resulted in significant increase in the PCE. Our findings indicate that it is imperative to design the structure of the conducting polymer to have adequate interactions with the PNP for achieving strikingly enhanced PCE.

Abstract: In-situ high-temperature measurements of optical constants (refractive indices n and extinction coefficients k) for each layer of solar selective absorbing multilayers were carried out to simulate solar-thermal conversion efficiency at high temperatures. Conventional Mo layers showed a significant rise in infrared emissivity and a degradation of selective absorbing behavior with the increasing temperature. In contrast, thermally stabilized Ag layers maintained low emissivity even at temperatures below 700°C. In these layers, agglomeration and vaporization were suppressed by SiNx nano-particles dispersed in the Ag matrix and interfacial W adhesive layers, respectively. The interband absorption of β-FeSi2 layers at higher temperatures revealed that larger n and k in the infrared region due to thermally excited electrons induced no rise in emissivity of the multilayers, and the narrower band gap based on Einstein's model shifted the absorptance cut-off wavelength closer to the ideal value and hence resulted in a higher solar absorptance. The solar-thermal conversion efficiencies of the multilayers consisting of low emissivity Ag layers with β-FeSi2 absorbers were found to be greater than 75.9%, as estimated from the temperature dependence of n and k spectra.

Abstract: Selecting a heat transfer fluid (HTF) depends on the value of thermophysical parameters. In response to the need for innovative heat transfer fluids in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, vegetable oil offers a promising solution. The relevant thermophysical properties are density, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. Moreover, a rheological property, the dynamic viscosity is also relevant. The objective of this work was to study and compare these properties for seven different vegetable oils (rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, palm, copra, cotton and jatropha) in the temperature range from ambient to 250°C. For all the properties studied, the values evolved with increasing temperature and were influenced by the fatty acid composition of each vegetable oil. Experimental results are compared with those in the literature and are found to be consistent. The temperature dependencies are correlated to temperature using polynomial equations. The correlations presented here may be useful as a database for the selection of innovative heat transfer fluids.

Abstract: Conventional photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are based on planar photoelectrodes supported on glass substrates and liquid electrolytes. Only few recent studies have examined an alternative PEC design which is robust and scalable, where the key elements are polymeric electrolyte membranes and porous photoelectrodes. This work aims to give further insights on the operation of such cells utilizing titania photoelectrodes and proton and hydroxide ion conducting membranes. Two families of photoelectrodes were developed on Ti porous substrate; TiO2 nanotubes grown by anodization and subsequent oxygen annealing, and TiO2 layers developed under oxygen annealing. Initial screening of the photoanodes for water splitting and (poly)alcohol photo-oxidation took place in conventional PEC cells. We found that the annealing temperature affects the performance of the photoanodes, evidenced by a monotonic increase in the activity for water photo-oxidation with increasing annealing temperature. Moreover it was demonstrated that anatase phase is predominantly active for the (poly)alcohol electro-oxidation, while there is a synergy between rutile and anatase which is beneficial for water splitting. In addition, the most promising photoanodes for water splitting were evaluated in our polymeric electrolyte membrane photoelectrochemical(PEM-PEC) cell during gas phase operation. It was found that PEM-PEC operation is more efficient when OH- conducting membranes are used, while the nature of the carrier gas does not significantly influence the activity. Overall, PEM-PEC operation is more promising than conventional PEC in both acidic and alkaline media, since comparable (or even at some cases higher) photocurrents were obtained while liquid pumping systems are not required for PEM-PEC devices.

Abstract: Electrochromic(EC), nonstoichiometric NiOx thin films were made by reactive magnetron sputtering at low oxygen flow ratio(i.e., P=O2/Ar+O2≤10%). The results of optical spectral, x-ray diffraction spectrum, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicate that the samples are oxygen(nickel)-deficient as P≤%4(≥%6), resulting in sub(over)-stoichiometry films. Spectroelectrochemical measurements show that the EC effect of NiOx in nonaqueous PC−LiClO4 electrolyte is direct correlation with the nickel vacancy concentration in films, while that in the aqueous KOH solution is nearly uninfluenced upon the change in stoichiometry as P≥%4. The films deposited at P=6% exhibit higher coloration efficiency of −25.3cm2C−1, larger ionic diffusion coefficient of −2.84×10−14m2s−1, and broader EC modulation span of 24% in PC−LiClO4 than the other ones. Based upon these values, EC devices featuring a WO3/PMMA−PC−LiClO4/NiOx structure and excellent performances were fabricated. We demonstrated that the nickel anodization should be responsible for the initial “activation” phenomena, which decreases(increases) the number of oxygen(nickel) vacancies. Moreover, the cause of degradation resulting from Li+-ion trapping in the IS layer was also clarified. This work provides a general framework for studying and designing superior EC devices, experimentally as well as theoretically.

Abstract: We attempt to evaluate Black Silicon (BSi) substrate loaded with water splitting (WS) semiconductor and Au particles as an efficient WS composite material. Further, thermal annealing was performed to study the effect of the WS photocatalyst microstructure evolution on optical properties, crystallinity, photo-response and the hydrophilicity. The thermal annealing was carried out at 450–850°C range in ambient environment. The WS crystal structure analysis by X-ray Diffraction, shows that TiO2 turns after annealing at 450°C to anatase phase known for high photocatalytic behavior. This transformation increases the optical reflection (%R) of the WS material in UV–Vis–Near IR region for both substrates (Si and BSi), however this increase about 1–5% is insignificant for the BSi due its morphology consisting of needles and wells. Nevertheless, this transformation decreases the hydrophilicity of the material surface of BSi due to its inherent structure. In addition, we showed that the photo-response after annealing is associated with lower resistance and higher photocurrent emission compared to non-annealed sample. This result suggests that BSi used as a substrate to receive WS semi-conductor has a great potential to be used as an efficient WS materials compared to Si.

Abstract: CuInS2 (CIS) based solar cell devices are fabricated by sensitizing TiO2 photoanodes with CIS quantum dots (CIS-QDs). Morphologically different TiO2, viz. Degussa P25 nanoparticles, smooth and fibrous microspheres (SμS and FμS respectively) are used to fabricate photoanodes. CIS-QDs are synthesized using dodecanethiol (DDT), CuI and In(OAc)3 precursors by solvothermal method. DDT surfactant present on the CIS QDs surface is replaced with 3-mercaptopropionic acid in a single phase one step procedure to enable efficient loading of QDs onto photoanode and as linker molecule for charge carrier extraction. The CIS QDs sensitized on SμS and FμS microsphere photoanode layers exhibit a photoconversion efficiency (η) of 3.2% and 1.6%, respectively, in comparison to η ≈ 2.1% for nanoparticulate TiO2 (Degussa P25). Further increase in efficiency is obtained (3.8% for SμS and 2.5% for FμS) when composite photoanode films made of porous microspheres filled with nanoparticulate P25 are used. A maximum efficiency of 3.8% (with JSC ≈ 6.2mA, VOC ≈ 926mV and FF ≈ 66 for cell area ≈ 0.25cm2 and thickness ≈ 20µm) is realized when 4.6nm CIS QDs sensitized on composite photoanode (consisting of 80wt. % SμS and 20wt. % P25) is used. High VOC observed is unprecedented and is possible due to combined effect of SμS+P25 composite photoanode properties such as fewer defects, good connectivity between particles, effective light scattering, minimum recombination, and effective electron transport and size optimized CuInS2 QDs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies reveal a low interfacial resistance and longer electron life time in SμS+P25 composite photoanodes.

Abstract: This work comprises an experimental study of the long-term performance and stability of partly covered photoelectrochromic (PEC) devices under various operating conditions. The most durable PEC device was tested for nearly one year in open circuit storage in the dark exhibiting a 26% reduction in the power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) unit. As regards optical performance, it was found to gradually converge to a contrast ratio of about 1.5:1, having passed through a transitional period of about 80 days, that caused a decrease in the coloration depth, without affecting reversibility. This gradual loss of coloration depth was attributed to the reaction of photoelectrons with triiodide ions at the electrochromic WO3 film-electrolyte interface, that takes place prior to the formation of the colored LixWO3 tungsten bronze, and is enhanced while the liquid electrolyte wets the WO3 film. This phenomenon was also observed in “redox” type electrochromic devices, verifying the proposed loss mechanism. PEC devices were also exposed to insolation in short (SC) and open (OC) circuit conditions. The PEC device tested in SC operation for more than four months, exhibited a contrast ratio comparable to that of the devices kept in storage, although an 80% reduction in the power conversion efficiency of the PV element has been observed. On the other hand, OC operation of 3 months did not affect the performance of the PV element, but, resulted in irreversible coloration of the device tested, due to trapping of Li ions within the WO3 matrix. Having identified the causes for the observed adverse phenomena, remedies can be sought, such as thin film barrier layers to prevent the loss of photoelectrons to the electrolyte, modified electrolytes to enhance the PV element stability, avoidance of prolonged OC operation to prevent irreversible coloration. Indeed, a 60 nm thick ZnS barrier deposited on top of the WO3 film was found to effectively suppress the loss current reactions, doubling the contrast ratio of the stabilized PEC devices to 2.8:1, at the expense of coloration speed.

Abstract: The optical transmittance and durability of several immersion cooling liquids that could be used for high concentration III-V photovoltaic systems are investigated. Firstly, the optical transmittance of the liquid candidates divided into three categories: synthetic oil, silicone oil and mineral oil are determined based on a double optical path-length transmittance method. The normalized photocurrent density of GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells when illuminated by the solar spectral irradiance filtered by each liquid is reported. Results show that the liquid candidates exhibit superior transmittance for the UV and visible wavelengths of interest, whereas they display some absorption bands in the 1200–1800nm spectrum and thus the photocurrent of the bottom subcell Ge decreases. This is not an issue since the bottom subcell normally produces excess current. Then, the optical transmittance of the liquid candidates is monitored during exposure to UV light, damp heat and high-temperature accelerated aging tests. The average transmittance for the wavelengths of interest is introduced to quantify changes in the optical transmittance of immersion cooling liquids after being subjected to the accelerated aging tests. Results from the accelerated aging tests indicate that dimethyl silicone oil, white oils A/B/C and C14 n-alkane are suitable for immersion cooling of multi-junction solar cells whose average transmittance losses are less than the total degradation value of 5% allowed for CPV modules under qualification tests in the IEC62108 standard. The optimum liquid for immersion cooling multi-junction solar cells is found to be dimethyl silicone oil due to its high transmittance for the wavelengths of interest and its loss in average transmittance over each exposure period is always less than 0.5%.

Abstract: Depurination is accelerated by heat and reactive oxygen species under physiological conditions. We previously reported that polyamines are involved in mitigation of heat shock and oxidative stresses through stimulation of the synthesis of heat shock and antioxidant proteins. This time, we investigated whether polyamines are directly involved in protecting nucleic acids from thermal depurination induced by high temperature. The suppressing efficiencies of depurination of DNA by spermine, caldopentamine and caldohexamine in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, were approximately 50%, 60% and 80%, respectively. Mg2+ also protected nucleic acids against depurination but to a lesser degree than polyamines. Longer unusual polyamines were more effective at protecting DNA against depurination compared to standard polyamines. The tRNA depurination suppressing efficiencies of spermine, caldopentamine and caldohexamine in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, were approximately 60%, 70% and 80%, respectively. Standard polyamines protected tRNA and ribosomes more effectively than DNA against thermal depurination. Branched polyamines such as mitsubishine and tetrakis(3-aminopropyl)ammonium also protected RNA more effectively than DNA against depurination. These results suggest that the suppressing effect of depurination of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) depends on the types of polyamines: i.e. to maintain functional conformation of nucleic acids at high temperature, longer and branched polyamines play important roles in protecting nucleic acids from depurination compared to standard polyamines and Mg2+.

Abstract: The use of single-cell DNA sequencing (sc-seq) techniques for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer is a rapidly developing field. Sc-seq research is gaining momentum by decreased sequencing costs and continuous improvements in techniques. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in the field of sc-seq in cancer and we discuss how sc-seq can contribute to improved care for cancer patients. Sc-seq has made it possible to study the genomes of individual cancer cells from primary tumors, metastases and circulating tumor cells, revealing inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, which cannot be detected using other methods. We review studies on individual human cancer cells in relation to prognosis and treatment response. Finally, future perspectives of sc-seq in cancer diagnosis and treatment are discussed with a focus on the use of circulating tumor cells to monitor therapy response and the development of personalized treatments based on knowledge about the genomic heterogeneity.

Abstract: Objective
To explore the differentiation tendency of CD90+ cardiac fibroblast (CFs) into cardiomyogenic cells in vitro and repair functions in acute myocardial infarction rats.
Methods
CD90+ subpopulation was sorted from rat CFs by flow cytometry. 10 μmoL/L of 5-Azacytosine (5-aza) was used to induce differentiation of CFs into cardiomyogenic cells. An acute myocardial infarction model was prepared by ligation of the rat left anterior descending coronary artery. After nuclei were labeled by DAPI, induced CD90+ CFs were injected into the infarction marginal zone. Before coronary ligation, 40 min after ligation, and at 7 and 14 days after cell transplantation, cardiac function changes were detected by ultrasound imaging system respectively. cTnT and endothelial cell marker VIII factor were detected by immunofluorescence staining. Infarct size was examined by TTC staining. Fibrosis was evaluated with masson’s trichrome staining, vimentin, type I and type III collagen staining.
Results
CD90+ CFs sorted by flow cytometry was 34.9%. On day 28 after induction, the cTnT positive rate was 61.17 ± 9.75%. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) at days 7 and 14 after transplantation were significantly increased compared with those before transplantation (P < 0.05). LVEF and LVFS at the 14th day after transplantation were also significantly increased compared with those at the 7th day (LVEF: 61.40 ± 2.45% vs. 56.25 ± 2.9%, LVFS: 33.21 ± 0.68% vs. 30.26 ± 2.06%, P < 0.01). Additionally, small numbers of CD90+ CFs differentiated into cardiomyocytes and became involved in neovascularization. CD90+ CFs and CFs reduced myocardial infarct size at days 14. It was significantly smaller in rats with CFs transplantation group than those in MI group(24.78 ± 2.28% vs. 31.28 ± 2.83%, P < 0.05), and it was also significantly smaller in rats with CD90+CFs transplantation group than those in CFs transplantation group (17.47 ± 4.15% vs. 24.78 ± 2.28%, P < 0.05). Meanwhile, The percentage of fibrotic area and vimentin, type I and type III collagen in the infarct border zone and infarct area were both significantly reduced in CD90 + CFs.
Conclusion
CD90+ CFs is the preponderant subpopulation of cardiomyogenic differentiation, with potential use as seed cells in basic and clinical research of heart regeneration and repair.

Abstract: The electrochromic (EC) performance of a WO3 film fabricated using a kinetic spray technique (nanoparticle deposition system, NPDS) was examined as a function of the particle size and phase of the WO3 particles. The total transmittance change of the deposited WO3 film containing crystalline nano-sized WO3 particles was 56% at 800nm, which resulted in a large shift in its transmission spectrum after coloring. Moreover, the charge density of the EC film using crystalline nano-sized WO3 particles was 22.06mCcm−2, which was 2.8 times higher than that of the film composed of crystalline micro-sized WO3 particles (7.97mCcm−2). Using crystalline nano-sized WO3 particles greatly increased the surface area, increased the number of absorption sites for Li ions inside the film, and thereby improved the charge density and transmittance. The transmittance change of the EC films using dual-phased nano-sized WO3 particles was 64% (at 800nm), which was still higher than that with crystalline nano-sized WO3 particles. The amorphous phase in the dual-phase nano-sized WO3 film provided good diffusion of Li ions; it had a high diffusion coefficient of 1.53 × 10−12cm2s−1 that derived from its loosely packed atomic structure. The amorphous region in a heterostructured WO3 film was effective for the fast diffusion of Li ions, while the crystalline nano-sized region in such a film provided a large surface area for an increased number of absorption sites for Li ions. This resulted in a dramatic improvement of the EC performance.

Abstract: We demonstrate the application of a liquid-processed doped silicon precursor as a doping source for the fabrication of interdigitated back contact solar cells. We integrate phosphorus- as well as boron-doped liquid silicon in our n-type interdigitated back contact cell process based on laser-structuring. The cell with the phosphorus back surface field from liquid silicon has an efficiency of 20.9% and the cell with the boron emitter from liquid silicon has an efficiency of 21.9%. We measure saturation current densities of 34fAcm−2 on phosphorus-doped layers with a sheet resistance of 108Ω/sq and 18fAcm−2 on boron-doped layers with a sheet resistance of 140Ω/sq using passivated test samples.

Abstract: Recent progress in commercial single-junction photovoltaic (PV) technologies has brought device efficiency closer to their practical limits. Module prices are dropping rapidly and solar energy has already reached grid parity in many areas. Solar module costs now constitute a small fraction of the total systems costs and to continue system cost reduction, increasing efficiency becomes even more critical. Multi-junction solar cells are the most logical path to increase PV module performance beyond 25%, but the varieties available today are still are out-performed in efficiency or cost by the main stream single-junction technologies: crystalline Si, CdTe and CIGS. Finding a solution for this problem is attracting a growing research interest. We review the latest developments in the field with particular focus on thin-film high band gap candidates such as perovskites on commercial bottom cells including silicon, CdTe and CIGS. We also review the current state of all-chalcopyrite tandems, and promising concepts using CdTe-alloys as a top cell on silicon.

Abstract: CuNbO3 is a promising semiconductor for photovoltaic and photo-electro-chemical conversion. To evaluate its potential, it is necessary to analyze the optical properties and quantify the main features when this material is used as an energy converter. To achieve this aim, first the optical properties are obtained using first-principles. The results, based on the split into contributions, show that the light absorption comes mainly from the p(O)-d(Nb) transitions of the NbO6 octahedra. Later the absorption coefficients are used as criteria to evaluate photo-voltages, photocurrents and efficiencies of the solar conversion, and the effect of using total and partial solar spectrum ranges. Furthermore, we show that the efficiencies and photocurrents could be increased significantly using a multi-gap approach. Furthermore some voltage loss effects are analyzed.

Abstract: Mitohormesis is a term used to define a biological response where the induction of a reduced amount of mitochondrial stress leads to an increment in health and viability within a cell, tissue, or organism. The mitochondrial stress response activated by a potentially damaging stimulus requires a coordinated dialogue with the cellular nucleus, known as mitonuclear communication. This interplay induced by the hormetic response in mitochondria relies in a variety of signals among which the most relevant ones are reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial metabolites, proteotoxic signals, the mitochondria–cytosol stress response, and the release of mitokines. The activation of the mitohormetic response increases lifespan in different animal models, from worms to mammals. Further, mitohormesis also enhances healthspan, particularly improving metabolism and immune system. Although multiple mediators and stress signals have been proposed to activate this protective mechanism, beneficial outcomes of mitohormesis are most probably due to an increase in mitochondrial ROS. Activation of other protective stress mechanisms as mitochondrial unfolded protein response or the increase in the expression of mitokines are also associated with the positive benefits exerted by mitohormesis. Herein, we review the different mitohormetic signals and pathways described from worms to mammals and their effects on health and survival. The identification and description of pathways and molecules implicated in the beneficial effects of mitohormesis will help understand the complex balance between death and survival in the face of mitochondrial damage and will allow to open a novel area of therapies aimed at improving health in humans.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among working-aged adults around the world. Hyperglycemia and intraocular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) over-accumulation are essential for the progression of diabetic retinopathy, which eventually results in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, characterized by pathologic angiogenesis and impaired vision. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) was highly induced in retinal endothelial cells under diabetic conditions. However, the role of TXNIP in diabetes-associated retinal angiogenesis remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether the absence of TXNIP alters diabetes-associated retinal angiogenesis. Exposure of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) to moderately high glucose (MHG) promoted cell migration and tube formation, but not proliferation. Knockdown of TXNIP suppressed moderately high glucose (MHG)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, migration, tube formation and activation of Akt/mTOR pathway in HRMECs. Moreover, gene silencing of TXNIP inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenic response by blocking VEGFR2 and downstream signal pathway Akt/mTOR activation in HRMECs. Furthermore, TXNIP knockout inhibited VEGF or VEGF and MHG-induced retinal angiogenesis ex vivo compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TXNIP deficiency inhibited VEGF or/and MHG-induced angiogenic response in HRMECs and mice retinas and suggested TXNIP may be a potential therapy target for treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract: (NH4)0.33WO3 nanoribbon films with different morphologies were directly grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses by using a simple hydrothermal method without a seed layer. By varying the reaction time, disordered nanoribbons array and ordered honeycomb-like structures woven from nanoribbons can be selectively synthesized. After annealing at 400°C for 1h, both of the two kinds of films are changed from (NH4)0.33WO3 to WO3, while the morphologies are well preserved. In comparison with the device based on disordered nanoribbons array film, a larger optical modulation (51.6% vs. 39.2% at 700nm), faster switching speeds (tc/tb, 5.7/4.2s vs. 9.6/6.5s) and a higher coloration efficiency (60.9cm2C−1 vs. 28.2cm2C−1) are achieved for the device based on honeycomb-like structures film. It should be attributed to the large specific surface area and ordered porous structure of the ordered honeycomb-like nanostructures, which may bring a high diffusion rate and short diffusion path for the intercalation and deintercalation of Li+ ions.

Abstract: Liquid phase crystallization of silicon (LPC-Si) on glass is a promising method to produce high quality multi-crystalline Si films with macroscopic grains. In this study, we report on recent improvements of our interdigitated back-contact silicon heterojunction contact system (IBC-SHJ), which enabled open circuit voltages as high as 661mV and efficiencies up to 14.2% using a 13µm thin n-type LPC-Si absorbers on glass. The influence of the BSF width on the cell performance is investigated both experimentally and numerically. We combine 1D optical simulations using GenPro4 and 2D electrical simulations using Sentaurus™ TCAD to determine the optical and electrical loss mechanisms in order to estimate the potential of our current LPC-Si absorbers. The simulations reveal an effective minority carrier diffusion length of 26µm and further demonstrate that a doping concentration of 4 × 1016cm−3 and a back surface field width of 60µm are optimum values to further increase cell efficiencies.

Abstract: Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-enwrapped silicon carbide nanowires (SiC NWs) network/expanded vermiculite (EVM) form-stable composite phase change materials (PSE fs-CPCMs) were prepared to overcome the disadvantage of form instability during phase transition and improve the slow heat transfer rate of PEG. The flowability was effectively solved by synergy between the pore structures of EVM and surfaces of SiC NWs. PSE3.29 exhibited the maximum adsorption ratio of PEG as high as 73.12wt%. The heat transfer of PSE fs-CPCMs could be significantly enhanced by the SiC NWs filler, and the thermal conductivity of PSE3.29 reached 0.53W/mK, which was 8.8 times higher than PEG. Theoretical calculation methods were applied to evaluate the thermal conductivity enhancement ability of SiC NWs. Maxwell-Eucken model (MEM) predicted obviously higher thermal conductivity enhancement than the experimental results due to stronger dependent on lower volume fraction of disperse phase. The prediction results obtained with effective medium percolation theory (EMPT) were in reasonable agreement with experimental values. Thermal energy storage behavior of PSE fs-CPCMs were strongly affected by the confinement effect of nanoscale pore structures of EVM and surface interactions of EVM and SiC NWs. FT-IR, TGA and phase change cycles test results confirmed that the PSE fs-CPCMs exhibited excellent chemical compatibility, thermal stability and reliability.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) cells convert only a small part of solar energy into electricity. The rest of solar energy is dissipated into heat leading to an increase of PV cells temperature. It is well established that temperature increase negatively affects the electrical yield of the cells. As PV panels are constituted of several PV cells which are mounted in series or parallel, the PV panels’ efficiency is therefore damaged by the increase of temperature. To study the coupled electrical yield and thermal behavior of PV panels, multi-physics models were developed. The models generally combine an electrical model with a thermal one. However, the photons wavelength effects are not accounted for in most of the models proposed in the literature. To account for this, we propose to use the Markov chain process for building an optical model. Therefore, the proposed multi-physics approach was developed by coupling three models: optical, electrical and thermal models. This proposed multi-physics approach was numerically implemented in the MATLAB software. The model was next applied to commercial silicon PV panels to predict their electrical and thermal behavior under Normal Operating Conditions Temperature (NOCT) conditions. The predicted results are compared to the manufacturer data sheets to validate the model. Finally, The thermal and electrical behaviors were also predicted under different irradiance levels.

Abstract: A facile multilayer hybrid coating with multifunctional characteristics like UV shielding, IR reflectance, photochromic and photoluminescence are designed with doped ZnO quantum dots [ZQDs] in PMMA polymer and proposed to fabricate solar radiation control active-interface layers. Sn and Ag doped ZnO quantum dots [ZQDs] were initially synthesized via a simple microwave assisted sol-gel strategy in the presence of 3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, a known organic capping agent. Doped ZQDs were assessed for the size, morphology, chemical nature, crystallinity and optical qualities. ZQDs were subsequently dispersed in methyl methacrylate monomer and polymerized in situ to obtain PMMA/ZQDs coating precursor sol. Multilayer hybrid coatings were then fabricated and examined for NIR shielding and UV absorbance efficiencies. Results indicated that the doped ZQDs/PMMA hybrid coatings have blue emission under UV light. With regard to NIR reflectance, the undoped PMMA/ZQDs hybrid coatings exhibit only < 14% NIR reflectance. It is enhanced to 30% and 23% upon doping with Ag and Sn in PMMA/ZQDs hybrids. The hybrid is redesigned with the inclusion of rare earth phosphate dispersoids by which the NIR reflectance is wisely enhanced to ~ 36%. A photochromic organic dye, spiropyran, is introduced in the doped ZQDs/PMMA hybrids, to display photochromic functionality with red emission. It is concluded that ZQDs doped with Sn and Ag ions once treated with organic dye molecule and inorganic co-activators, can result in an innovative photochromic, UV/NIR shielding solar-control interface coatings.

Abstract: Latent thermal energy storage using phase change material (PCM) is an effective way to store and transport energy. In this work, expanded graphite was modified using octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether to generate modified expanded graphite (MEG), and then a novel shape-stabilized Ba(OH)2·8H2O/MEG composite PCM was synthesized by incorporating Ba(OH)2·8H2O into MEG matrix. Mass fractions of Ba(OH)2·8H2O in composite PCM were calculated from 74% to 93%. The effects of MEG on properties of PCM were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and thermal constant analyzer. The results indicated that MEG had the desired compatibility with Ba(OH)2·8H2O. The phase separation of Ba(OH)2·8H2O was effectively inhibited by the MEG matrix and the supercooling temperature decreased from 13°C for Ba(OH)2·8H2O to 2.4°C for composite PCM with a MEG matrix density of 200g/L. At the same matrix density, the thermal conductivity of composite PCM reached 3.58W/(mK), 1.84 times higher than that of Ba(OH)2·8H2O. The latent heat was approximately equal to the product of the latent heat of Ba(OH)2·8H2O and its mass fraction. Moreover, the enthalpy loss of the composite PCM was negligible after 400 cycles, showing good thermal reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, we designed a novel organic-inorganic nanohybrid electrochromic material through tethering polyaniline and gold colloids with an interfacial coordinate bond. The enhanced electrochemical and electrochromic properties were expected owing to the high conductivities of the gold colloids and strong interfacial interaction between the organic phase and inorganic phase. The water-dispersible polyaniline-gold (PANI-Au) nanohybrids were synthesized successfully through grafting copolymerization of aniline with p-aminothiophenol (PATP) functionalized gold colloids in an aqueous system using a macromolecular acid, poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) as the dopant agent. The structures, morphologies, and electrochemical and electrochromic properties of PANI-Au nanohybrids were characterized by the UV–vis, FTIR, Raman spectrometers, SEM, and electrochemical working station, respectively. The results show that through incorporating gold nanoparticles into the PANI matrix with the interfacial coordinate bond, PANI-Au nanohybrids possess uniform nanoparticles morphologies with diameter ~180nm. The electrochemical activity and the charge transfer process of PANI were enhanced, which is proved by the CV test and EIS analysis. As the results, the PANI-Au nanohybrids can switch at relatively lower potentials and give a higher optical contrast as comparison with neat PANI: PSS. With ~1.4wt% Au loading amount, the contrast of PANI-Au nanohybrid is 0.97, which is much higher than 0.76 of PANI: PSS. The coloration and bleaching time are also shortened from 13.4s and 8.9s for PANI: PSS to 8.3s and 7.6s for PANI-Au-c, respectively.

Abstract: In many areas which call for solar radiation harvesting, from buildings to solar power plants, all manners of windows and protective glass envelopes are required. A high transmission of solar light through glass is therefore mandatory, mostly in the visible range for lighting purposes and also in the near infrared range for power generation. For this purpose, antireflective coatings (ARCs) are deposited on glass surfaces to avoid parasitic reflection and increase transmission of the incident solar light. Porous SiO2 or compact MgF2 have been identified in the literature as good antireflective materials for glass due to their low refractive index. The total solar power transmitted through coated glass is determined by the wavelength-dependent optical properties (spectral complex refractive index) of both the glass and the ARC deposited on it. For many optical applications other than solar, the glass industry takes into account the impact of the variation with wavelength of the glass refractive index, represented by the Abbe number, on its transmittance. For solar applications however, in most reported studies on ARCs for solar glass, the optimization of the ARC in terms of porosity and thickness is done by considering the refractive index of the glass as a single value independent of wavelength. This approximation can affect the accuracy and pertinence of the solar ARC optimization. In this work, we therefore propose to join these two approaches by including the glass refractive index variation with wavelength in the optimization of a typical solar ARC, for a large catalog of glasses available in the industry. To achieve this goal, we simulated and optimized with a stochastic algorithm the solar antireflective properties of a porous SiO2 coating on 24 different glasses. We studied the impact on their solar transmittance of the glass refractive index variation with wavelength, the incident solar spectrum (Direct + Circumsolar or Global Tilt), the incidence angle and the glass solar absorptance. Glasses with low refractive indices and high Abbe numbers were found to be necessary to ensure high solar transmittance. Such properties are met in crown glass such as FK®, PK® or BK®.

Abstract: Novel double-doped polymer optical fibers have been fabricated by a bulk polymerization and fiber drawing process for fluorescent fiber solar concentration applications. Poly(methyl methacrylate) has been used as host material and a combination of organic dyes (Perylene/Lumogen Orange/Coumarin 1/Coumarin 6)) and metalorganic materials (Eu(TTFA)3Phen) have been employed as dopants. A concise polymer analysis has been carried out, and the obtained fibers have been characterized under standard AM 1.5G solar simulator excitation. The output power generated at one of the end surfaces of each of the fibers have been measured for 6cm illuminated fiber length, obtaining a concentrated intensity of 0.31mW/mm2 and a fiber conversion efficiency of 0.41% in the best case. Besides, the performance of the fabricated fibers under different weather scenarios have been studied, showing good response at all the simulated day-conditions. Active fiber lengths of more than 6m have been successfully tested, obtaining output intensities of 1.3mW/mm2. Good performance under constant excitation has also been reported during photostability experiments. The results obtained may have a strong impact in the field of luminescent solar concentrators as they offer a promising cost-effective route to green energy production.

Abstract: Simulation of a complete PV system shall stem from a Multiphysics perspective. Within a continuum modeling approach, among these physics, the thermal model of a PV panel is most crucial because all the other models are directly or indirectly related to it. As all models of a PV system are connected sequentially, error from one model component propagates to the next model component and the overall system error accumulates eventually. One of the main objectives of this work was to increase the prediction accuracy by developing a fully transient 2-D finite difference (FD) based thermal model. The developed computational code is completely generic and can be applied to any type of PV technology or configuration. It was shown in the study how to choose an appropriate grid size for any FD model. Using the developed code, various studies were also conducted. Modified radiation models, heat transfer coefficients and thermal networks for the PV panel were proposed in the study, which remarkably improved the accuracy of the thermal model. Also studied were the effects of including heat transfer from the sides of a PV panel and heat generation in the front glass cover. The results showed that ignoring the heat transfer from the sides of a PV panel and including heat generation in the front glass cover have no noticeable difference in the model prediction.

Abstract: Tyro3, a member of TAM receptor tyrosine kinase family, has been implicated in the regulation of melanoma progression and survival. In this study, we sought the molecular mechanism of Tyro3 effects avoiding endogenous background by overexpression of Tyro3 in fibroblasts that have negligible levels of Tyro3. This introduction triggers the tyrosyl-phosphorylation of ACTN4, a member of actin binding protein family involved in motility, a behavior critical for invasive progression, as shown by siRNA to Tyro3 limiting melanoma cell migration and invasion. Tyro3-mediated phosphorylation of ACTN4 required FAK activation at tyrosine 397 and the EGF receptor cascade, but not EGFR ligand binding. Using PCR-based mutagenesis, the sites of Tyro3-mediated ACTN4 phosphorylation were mapped to ACTN4 tyrosine 11 and 13, and this occurs in conjunction with EGF-mediated phosphorylation on Y4 and Y31. Interestingly, Tyro3-mediated phosphorylation only slightly decreases the actin binding activity of ACTN4. However, this rendered the phosphorylated ACTN4 resistant to the m-calpain cleavage between Y13 and G14, a limited proteolysis that prevents growth factor regulation of ACTN4 interaction with F-actin. Overexpression of both WT ACTN4 and ACTN4Y11/13E, a mimic of ACTN4 phosphorylated at tyrosine 11 and 13, in melanoma WM983b cells resulted in a likely mesenchymal to amoeboidal transition. ACTN4Y11/13E-expressing cells were more amoeboidal, less migratory on collagen I gel coated surface but more invasive through collagen networks. In parallel, expression of ACTN4Y11/13E, in ACTN4 knockdown melanoma WM1158 cells resulted in an increase of invasion compared to WT ACTN4. These findings suggest that Tyro3-mediated phosphorylation of ACTN4 is involved in invasion of melanoma cells.

Abstract: As a thermal energy storage medium (TESM) at moderate-high temperature of concentrating solar power (CSP), the molten NaCl-MgCl2 has sharp corrosive action on a metal container. The influence of MgCl2 content on a metal corrosion behavior is not clear. The corrosion behavior of a Fe based alloy (GH1140) in molten NaCl-MgCl2 (at 1123K) with different content of MgCl2 (wt%：0.0，48.9，61.0，93.6) were studied by the submergence corrosion experience. Results show that: after corrosion for 5h, there is a negative correlation between the weight loss of samples and the content of MgCl2. In the molten salt without MgCl2, the sample was corroded according to the mechanism of “dissolution as anode- oxidizing- peeling off of oxide film”. After adding a little MgCl2 in the molten salt, an unprotected MgO shell was formed on the sample surface. The samples weight decreased and obeyed a line law. The elements of Fe and Cr deplete in the corrosion layer. Corrosion mechanism is “dissolution as anode- oxidizing- reduction- chlorination”. When the content of MgCl2 is very high in the molten salt, partial pressure of Cl2 increases. The corrosion mechanism is similar to what in the molten salt with a little MgCl2, but the chlorination reaction is more severe.

Abstract: Hybrid materials combining a wide bandgap metal oxide semiconductor, metal chalcogenide nanocrystals and molecular systems represent very attractive materials for fabricating devices with new function or improved photoelectrochemical performance. This study deals with sensitization of NiO, which is a p-type semiconductor, by quantum dots (QDs) of PbS with an average diameter of 3nm. The PbS QDs were attached to the monocrystalline film of NiO by mercaptopropionic acid linker and were subsequently capped with methyl-pyridine naphthalene diimide (NDI) units to prepare quantum dot sensitized solar cells (p-QDSSCs) on NiO electrodes. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements of the PbS emission were used to determine the rate constants for charge transfer from the PbS exciton to the NiO, cobalt based redox mediator and NDI. Notably, it was shown that NDI quenches the PbS exciton by electron transfer with a quite fast rate constant (6.9 × 107s−1). The PbS QDs sensitized NiO films were finally used to fabricate solar cells with tris(4,4′-ditert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine) cobalt(III/II) as redox mediator. It was observed that the presence of NDI on PbS improved the photovoltaic performance by 50% relative to that of cells without NDI, leading to a device with the following characteristics: Jsc = 5.75mA/cm2, Voc = 226mV, ff = 34% and PCE = 0.44%. This study demonstrates that photogalvanic processes can be a productive pathway to better performing sensitized p-type semiconductor for p-QDSSC. In other words, photoinduced electron transfer from the QDs towards the electrolyte rather than initial photoinduced charge injection into the p-type semiconductor can be a favorable operative mechanism in QD sensitized NiO films and might be exploited further for the construction of better performing solar cells or photocatalytic devices.

Abstract: Despite their classic bean-shaped depiction, mitochondria have very different aspects in each cell type. From long filamentous structures to punctuated small round organelles. These shapes can dynamically change in response to nutrients and in situations of metabolic disease. However, why do mitochondria adapt different shapes and how is this determined? In this review, we will aim to understand different visions on how metabolic cues influence mitochondrial shape and vice-versa. This response can be dramatically different between tissues and cells, as illustrated by a large array of genetically engineered mouse models reported to date. We will use these models to understand the role of different mitochondrial dynamics–related proteins and processes.

Abstract: Carbon-based hole conductor-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to the simple process, low cost and relatively high stability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is considerably lower than that of the standard PSCs using spiroOMeTAD as hole-conductor material and Au (or Ag) as counter electrodes. Herein, by means of incorporating p-type NiO nanoparticles into carbon electrodes, the PCE of the hole conductor-free PSCs was significantly boosted to 13.26% from 10.29% of that based on pure carbon electrode, because of the enhancement of hole transfer. In addition, the carbon-based hole conductor-free PSCs showed 85% of the initial efficiency after 800h in ambient atmosphere. The results indicate that the p-type NiO nanoparticles can enhance hole transfer from perovskite into carbon electrodes, and the carbon electrodes can prevent the water in the air to improve stability. While the PSCs using Spiro-OMeTAD as hole conductor and Ag as electrodes have slightly lower PCE of 13.24% and lower stability. Hence, it is an effective strategy of incorporating p-type nanomaterials into carbon electrodes to enhance the carbon-based hole conductor-free PSCs.

Abstract: Solar towers with volumetric air receiver technology are a promising technology for continuous or demand oriented electricity supply from a sustainable resource with competitive costs. The absorber elements used for this receiver technology are permeable ceramic honeycombs, which are heated up by concentrated solar radiation. Afterwards the heat is being transferred to air, which finally feeds the steam generator of a Rankine-Cycle. Resulting from the intensive solar flux of up to 800kW/m2, the absorber modules are exposed to severe thermal loads. Maximum temperatures of more than 1000°C are reached. Furthermore, during daily start-up and shut down procedures and additionally during cloud transitions the absorbers undergo transient heat loads, which might reduce their lifetime. The objective of the present study is to quantify the effect of typical thermal loads and to calculate the resulting mechanical stresses inside the absorber modules. Two types of absorbers have been compared, a conventional coarse honeycomb and an advanced one with a higher cellularity offering an improved efficiency potential. The mechanical strength of the cellular material is used to find out whether the computed thermomechanical stresses are critical or not. Finally, experimental thermo-shock tests have been carried out to validate the numerical models. It could be shown that under normal operation the thermomechanical stresses remain in a range markedly below the fracture stress in both absorber variants. As a consequence, limits are given to what extent the material should be thermally loaded during operation.

Abstract: Mismatch loss relating to difference in as-manufactured cell performance is known to be nearly non-existent in a modern, undamaged, photovoltaic module. At a system level, potential contributors to this loss can include manufacturing variance, uncertainties in cell and module performance measurements and variation in operating conditions in the field. While some of these aspects have been individually studied, often using idealised performance models, there lacks a holistic treatment that assesses all the contributing effects in the same context. This is particularly important given the potential for trade-off among some of the underlying loss mechanisms in the way cells and modules are grouped and installed. This study shows, using a hybridised approach of published studies, manufacturing data, field performance data, and performance and variance modeling, that mismatch loss remains a potentially important performance loss mechanism in many photovoltaic installation. The decisions made in manufacturing pertaining to mismatch loss are found to often have only a small impact, despite potentially adding cost and complexity to the process. Conversely, field installation issues are shown to be of dominant importance in the final mismatch loss estimate. Understanding the individual contributing mechanisms, all together, will allow for the development of a realistic and least cost approach to mitigating the loss right from the decisions made in manufacturing through to how the modules are installed in the field.

Abstract: Electromagnetic wave absorbers with thinner structural thickness but with broader spectral absorption bandwidth are more desirable for various applications in solar energy and optoelectronics. In this work, a refractory titanium nitride meta-surface with efficient, ultra-broadband solar energy absorption is theoretically designed and numerically demonstrated. The resulting 250-nm-thick meta-surface absorber exhibits an ultra-broadband perfect absorption over the whole ultraviolet-visible-near infrared range. With taking the A > 90% into account, the absorption bandwidth is up to 1110nm with the wavelength range varied from 0.316 μm to 1.426 μm. The titanium nitride nano-resonators array and its coating structure of titanium dioxide array cooperatively provide multiple resonant modes, which therefore introduce strong coupling with the solar radiation and eventually produce an ultra-broadband absorption. The absorption spectrum can be feasibly manipulated via tuning the structural parameters. Most importantly, in sharp contrast to the common absorbers formed with metallic nano-resonators, the titanium nitride based solar absorber is with much stronger thermal stability, illustrating the impressive promise for wide applications such as thermo-photovoltaics and other high-power optoelectronic processes.

Abstract: In this work, a new approach for the front side metallization of silicon solar cells is presented. Molten solder (Sn96Ag3Cu) is directly printed in a non-contact manner on solar cell precursors via StarJet technology. The StarJet technology features a pneumatically driven, heatable printhead with a reservoir of molten metal and a star-shaped silicon nozzle chip. Using this printhead, a jet of molten metal with 55 µm ± 5 µm diameter is generated and used to apply busbars as well as contact fingers on prefabricated electroplated seed layers. After deposition via StarJet, printed fingers have a minimum width of 70 µm and a mean aspect ratio of 0.94. The printed metallization is evaluated optically and electrically. Aluminum back surface field silicon solar cells with front side electroplated NiAg seed layers and StarJet metallization (busbars and fingers) show efficiencies of up to 18.1% after degradation. Solder is about 30–40 times cheaper than silver and therefore may allow cost-efficient solar cell metallization. The StarJet metallization on electroplated NiAg seed layers is fully functional and requires no additional post-processing steps. Only 6 mg of Ag per cell are consumed for the seed layer. As a proof-of-principle, a module is demonstrated, which consists of four solar cells that are metallized via StarJet.

Abstract: An UV-crosslinked ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer network and succinonitrile (SN) were employed to prepare a solid polymer composite electrolyte (PCE) matrix at room temperature, so as to immobilize heptyl viologen (HV) and phenyl viologen (PV) at the electrode surface in an electrochromic device (ECD). PV exhibits attractive electrochromic (EC) property, however, its aggregation occurs immediately in conventional liquid or gel electrolyte due to strong π-π stacking. Herein, an all-solid-state ECD is proposed to tackle the said aggregation issue of PV. An all-solid-state ECD, consisting of HV, PV, and solid polymer electrolyte, is studied by changing the operating potential window to achieve multi-color characteristics. The proposed ECD shows transparent, green, marine, and gray color at the open-circuit potential, 0.6V, 0.8V, and 1.0V, respectively. The first set of redox peaks is due to the redox reaction of PV, and the second set of the redox peaks is the overlap of the first reduced state of HV and the second reduced state of PV. The combination of two viologens in a simple cell configuration (glass/ITO/multicolor-EC + solid electrolyte/ITO/glass) not only offers the characteristics of di-reduced PV species but also opens up a new avenue for color-tuning.

Abstract: Aspirin has positive effects on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) osteogenic differentiation. However, researchers did not give much thought to its effect on BMSCs adipogenic differentiation. Here, we analyzed the effect of aspirin on the BMSCs adipogenic differentiation. To detect whether the effect of aspirin on the adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs is associated with the disturbed epigenetic modification, the expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs), activity of HDACs and HAT, global histone H3 acetylation and H3k9 acetylation alterations were investigated. Moreover, to further explore and understand the binding mode between aspirin and HDACs, an attempt was made to identify the interaction between aspirin and the HDACs with the aid of in silico docking study. The results showed that aspirin could induce inhibition of BMSCs adipogenesis. The level of HDAC activity, global histone H3 acetylation, and H3k9 acetylation were all down regulated during adipogenic differentiation, and aspirin can reverse these decreases. Furthermore, the HDAC isoforms have different expression patterns in those progresses. The expression of HDAC9 was increased in a does-dependent manner when aspirin was introduced during BMSCs adipogenic differentiation. Docking study showed that high affinity of HDAC9 to aspirin was existed, suggesting that HDAC9 may has an important role in the process of aspirin-induced suppression of adipogenesis. Further studies are needed to define the intricate mechanisms of the HDAC isoforms, and all of these enable us to understand aspirin and its efficacy of inhibition of adipogenic differentiation and pave the way to aspirin clinical using for the tissue regenerating.

Abstract: A method of fabricating an industrially scalable, widely applicable, and easily repairable superhydrophobic self-cleaning cool orange-gray coating using commercially available materials and following a simple industrial procedure is introduced. Grinding the coating surfaces using an appropriate emery paper creates microgrooves with suitable widths and exposes micro- and nanoparticles on the coating surface. Both factors together endow the coating surfaces with superhydrophobic self-cleaning properties. The hydrophobicity of the coating possesses good resistance to alkali, acid and mechanical abrasion. Grinding the coating surfaces using emery papers also increases the solar reflectance of the coating. The cooling effect of the superhydrophobic coating, which has a solar reflectance of 0.815, is estimated to be 23°C relative to concrete on a typical clear summer sunny day. Although the superhydrophobic self-cleaning property and solar reflectance of the coating may be compromised by artificial accelerated weathering, the superhydrophobic self-cleaning property can be easily and fully reestablished and the inclined solar reflectance may be partially restored after the coating surfaces are ground using an appropriate emery paper.

Abstract: A series La-doped WO3/SrTiO3 heterojunctions photocatalyst were successfully prepared using solvothermal method. The as-fabricated heterostructures composite included La-doped WO3 fluff spheres tightly grew on the surface of SrTiO3 cubic particles. The crystallanity, structural, morphological and optical features of the catalysts were characterized using several techniques including XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM UV−vis and HRTEM. The photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction was evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible-light irradiation. The influence of La doping and SrTiO3 molar ratio on heterojunctions photocatalysts was investigated. Among the as-prepared photocatalysts, the LWS50 sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, almost 100% MO were completely decomposed within 75 min under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Compared with the pure WO3 and SrTiO3, the enhancement of photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the three-dimensional hierarchical structure and the effectively transfer and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in La doped WO3 and SrTiO3 heterojunctions

Abstract: The combination of tunable direct bandgap III-V absorbers with active Si substrates promises high-efficiency tandem solar cells. To yield the ideal III-V bandgaps between 1.6 and 1.8eV which is considered to achieve current matching with the Si bottom-cell, however, either a big lattice-mismatch or dilute nitrides had to be considered so far. Here, we propose a new structure for a two-terminal III-V-on-Si solar cell which bases on strain-balanced III-V multi-quantum wells (MQWs) embedded in a metamorphic GaAsP top-cell matrix. Strain-balanced MQWs extend the absorption edge to a longer wavelength and enable a reduction of the As content in the GaAsP metamorphic top-cell matrix. And accumulation of carriers in MQWs favors radiative recombination, which is beneficial for high efficiency while deep quantum wells lower the charge carrier collection efficiency. Here, we predict solar energy conversion efficiencies over 42.6% with an entire MQW as thin as 500nm. The applied model takes into account the drawbacks of MQWs, such as limited light absorption and the bottleneck of charge carrier collection from the confinement.

Abstract: Directionally solidified eutectic rods of Al2O3-Y3−xErxAl5O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) composition have been grown using the laser floating zone method at processing rates of 25mm/h and 750mm/h. For all the samples the microstructure presents the same morphology, consisting of an interpenetrated 3D eutectic network of both Al2O3 and garnet phases, while eutectic interspacing strongly depends on the solidification rate. Optical absorption, luminescence and thermal emission have been investigated as a function of the growth rate and the erbium content. From the luminescence characterization it can be concluded that erbium ions are present in the eutectic only in the garnet phase. Near infrared thermal emission has been measured at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1500°C. Selective emission consisting of an emission band at 1540nm and a weaker line at 970nm, ascribed to the radiative de-excitation of the thermally excited Er3+ ions from the 4I13/2 and 4I11/2 multiplets to the 4I15/2 ground state respectively, has been detected in all the samples containing erbium. The influence of the erbium content, the microstructure and the temperature on the thermal emission has been investigated. The strongest selective emission has been obtained for samples with x=3 although it does not increase proportionally to the erbium content. The thermal emission becomes more intense when the temperature is increased but the selective emission seems to saturate at temperatures higher than 1300°C. This effect is especially noticeable for x=3 and is attributed to thermally activated non-radiative de-excitation channels. It is suggested that these channels become effective through energy transfer among Er3+ ions and towards killers.

Abstract: Novel magnetically separable Ag3PO4/MnFe2O4 nanocomposite with 30wt% MnFe2O4 was synthesized for the first time by a facile hydrothermal route and the composition and microstructure of the nanocomposite was fully characterized. The photocatalytic activity of Ag3PO4/MnFe2O4 nanocomposite was evaluated in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B (RhB) dyes under natural solar-light irradiation with an average light intensity of ~ 185mWcm−2. The results displayed that the degradation efficiency of the Ag3PO4/MnFe2O4 nanocomposite was 98% for methylene blue (MB) and 100% for Rhodamine B (RhB) in 82min. The photocatalytic activity of Ag3PO4/CoFe2O4 was almost 1.5 and 3 times as high as those of the pure Ag3PO4 and CoFe2O4, respectively. The remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance of Ag3PO4/MnFe2O4 nanocomposite compared with the individual Ag3PO4 and MnFe2O4 was ascribed to its higher specific surface area and the existence of a synergic effect between Ag3PO4 and MnFe2O4 that resulted in efficient separation of electron–hole pairs. Trapping experiments indicated that the photodegradation of dyes was mainly achieved by superoxide radicals (•O2-) attack in Ag3PO4/MnFe2O4 suspension. Furthermore, the possible mechanism of excellent solar-light photoactivity activity of the Ag3PO4/MnFe2O4 nanocomposite was proposed based on the experimental results. Due to the existence of the magnetic MnFe2O4 nanoparticles, the Ag3PO4/MnFe2O4 nanocomposite could be magnetically separated from the reaction mixture by a usual magnet with an intensity of 0.1T (= 1kOe) and reused without any change in structure.

Abstract: Thermal behavior of a building mass can be enhanced using phase change materials (PCMs) as latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) materials. Such type thermal enhanced construction materials can be used for passive solar heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) purposes in building envelopes. This work was focused on development, characterization of LHTES properties and establishment of thermal performance of a cement-based composite PCM (Cb-CPCM) plaster for low-temperature LHTES targets in buildings. The eutectic mixture of capric acid(CA)-myristic acid(MA) was absorbed as 28wt% by cement through vacuum embedding method. The chemical structures and morphology cement/(CA-MA) composite and its pure components were investigated by FT-IR, XRD and SEM techniques. The LHTES characteristics of the produced Cb-CPCM were determined by DSC analysis. The DSC results indicated that the form-stable Cb-CPCM melted and solidified at 21.13 and 17.90°C and had corresponding LHTES capacities as 41.78 and 39.56J/g, respectively. The TGA results and cycling test revealed that the Cb-CPCM had high thermal resistance, long-term cycling chemical stability and reliability. Furthermore, two cubic test rooms were built with/without Cb-CPCM to compare thermo-regulating performance in laboratory-scale. The temperature difference between the indoor temperatures of the cubes was measured as averagely 0.78°C during heating period. All results exhibited that the prepared Cb-CPCM could be considered as a potential composite PCM for low-temperature HVAC intentions in buildings.

Abstract: In an effort to reduce the radiation degradation of triple-junction solar cells, imbedded photon management is investigated as a means for reducing the middle subcell thickness while maintaining output. The (In)GaAs subcells of the conventional lattice-matched InGaP/(In)GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells with back-side light-reflecting structures were simulated. Subcells with two-dimensional dielectric moth-eye reflection grating show promising results: more than 70% of incident in-band light is reflected into the non-zero diffraction orders which allows the thickness of the subcell to be decreased from 3.5 to 1.25 µm. This reduction of the subcell thickness substantially enhances the radiation hardness of the multi-junction solar cell.

Abstract: In this study, thermal performance and optical properties of MAX phase materials subjected to high concentrated flux are characterized. A new indoor facility is developed that allows for investigation of the independent effect of irradiance and temperature on the thermal performance of the material. Two MAX namely, Titanium Aluminum Carbide (Ti2AlC) and Chromium Aluminum Carbide (Cr2AlC) are examined in this study. Both materials are exposed to high concentrated homogenized flux in the range of 527.2 kWm−2 – 917 kWm−2 for 1000 s and 3000 s using a high flux solar simulator while their temperatures are maintained at 60 °C ± 5 °C via water-cooled heat flux gage. Materials’ surface characterization before and after irradiation is carried out using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray fluorescence analysis. It is found that both materials have excellent resistance to high concentrated flux, but that Ti2AlC shows higher light scattering due to the oxidation of its surface. It is also found that the variations in the optical properties over time do not depend on the selected incident flux level. The thermal performance of Ti2AlC and Cr2AlC was found to varies in the 0.56 – 0.68 and 0.60 – 0.67 range, respectively, for selected flux levels. Flux transmission performance of both materials is not affected by exposure to high concentrated flux.

Abstract: A new magenta-to-transmissive electrochromic polymer, poly(3,4-bis(3-bromopropoxy)thiophene) (PBBrPOT) was synthesized by electrochemical polymerization and its electrochromic properties were characterized in detail. Compared with the representative “large-volume alkyl substituents” strategy, herein we use bromines as the end-capping groups of two propoxyl substituents on the 3- and 4- position of the thiophene ring to introduce more steric repulsion within the polymer chains, and therefore obtain a magenta neutral state of the polymer. The PBBrPOT film shows a set of reasonable electrochromic features, including low driving potentials (−0.1V and 0.9V), appropriate transmittance change (38% at 556nm), but a relatively longer response time in bleaching process (t95 = 6.5s).

Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO) and boron nitride (BN) are introduced into polyethylene glycol (PEG) as supporting materials and thermally conductive fillers to improve shape-stability and thermal conductivity. The obtained PEG/BN/GO composite phase change material (PCM) with 4wt% GO and 30wt% BN exhibits a thermal conductivity as high as 3.00Wm−1K−1, 10-fold higher than that of pure PEG. Owing to the hybrid network structure of GO and BN in the matrix, the shape-stability of the composite PCM is greatly enhanced, even when compressed by a constant normal force of 5N as the temperature rises to 120°C. Simultaneously, the thermal energy storage density of the composite PCM reaches 107.4Jg−1, which ensures the potential application to realize an efficient light-to-electric energy conversion and storage. The composite PCM maintains stable thermophysical properties and chemical structure after 100 cycles of melting and freezing. The enhanced comprehensive performance of the composite PCMs contributes to enabling their practical application for effective energy conversion, storage and utilization, especially for the lasting renewable solar energy.

Abstract: The device performance of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells are improved significantly by annealing the full devices at 270 °C for 3 min in air. This paper proposes the origin of the improvement of solar cell by post-annealing treatment by analyzing the results of external quantum efficiency (EQE), Raman spectra, capacitance-voltage (C-V), admittance spectra (AS) measurements, and numerical simulation. The experimental results show that the dominant free hole carriers changed from deep defect CuZn to the much higher density of shallow defect VCu after annealing process, which resulting the increase of density of benign [VCu+ZnCu] defect cluster, and the decrease of density of detrimental [2CuZn+SnZn] defect cluster in the surface region of absorber. As a result, the open voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) increase significantly. The short circuit current density (JSC) increases slightly, which can be attributed to the decrease of interface recombination as well as the improvement of band alignment at CdS/CZTSSe interface. As a consequence, the conversion efficiency of CZTSSe solar cell is improved from 4.41% to 8.02% by post-annealing the full device. Additionally, numerical simulations using wxAMPS software are conducted to reveal insight into the role of the changes of defect type, defect density, and carrier density by post-annealing treatment.

Abstract: The behaviour of photoanodes based on TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) grown on Ti gauze (80 mesh) by controlled anodic oxidation was studied in a compact photo-electrocatalytic (PECa) device for H2 production by water photo-electrolysis. The 3D-type structured TNTs-Ti meshes evidenced: i) a mesoporosity due to the presence of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays grown on the round surface of the regularly woven wires of the Ti gauze and ii) a macroporosity due to the open area (36%) of the mesh. The resulting hierarchical porous 3D structure allowed the TNTs-Ti meshes to act both as photoactive materials for efficient light absorption and as porous substrates for fast mass diffusion of protons. The synthesis of TNTs was investigated by varying the applied voltage (in the range 40–60V) and the anodization time (from 20min to 7h). Results showed that two main opposite aspects influenced their performances in the PECa cell: i) the inner diameter and ii) the length of TNTs. While the increase of the inner diameter with the anodization time should favour H2 productivity, longer nanotubes negatively influence the catalytic activity due to increasing charge recombination phenomena. The result is an initial decreasing profile of H2 evolution vs. anodization time, reaching a minimum at 3h and then increasing again for the 5h-anodized sample (H2 production rate: 1.4Lm−2h−1). The maximum photoconversion efficiency (0.7%) was obtained, instead, for the 20min-anodized sample. It is to remark that tests of water splitting were performed with no applied bias and without adding sacrificial donors, opening the route for a sustainable use of these 3D-type meso/macro porous structured photoanodes in the production of solar fuels.

Abstract: Methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) mixed perovskites have been widely utilized in invert planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) applications due to their great potentials such as solution processing, high power conversion efficiency, high absorption, and low cost. To commercialize the PSCs, further improving the device performance without detrimentally changing the device configuration is important at present. Herein, small amount (5%) of CsI is introduced to form a pinhole-free mixed perovskite light absorption layer in a flexible photovoltaic system with enhanced main photovoltaic parameters of the device, resulting in a ~ 36% enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 8.9% to 12.1% (from 11.3% to 14.6% for rigid device). The origins of the enhancement have been studied by exploring the crystal structures, optical absorption, and crystal morphlogies of the synthesised perovskite layers and charge carrier behaviors of the devices. Through small perturbation transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements, the lifetime of the charge carriers are found remarkably increased after the small amount of CsI doping. These characteristics make cation doping of the mixed perovskite layer a promising method in facile tuning of the film quality of the perovskite layer for efficient charge carriers transporting and further boosting the PCE of the devices.

Abstract: The limited conductivity in hematite has been currently considered as a critical bottleneck in improving the efficiency of solar-driven water oxidation. Here we shed light on the improvement of carrier conductivity by combing orientation control and transition metal doping. To rule out the influence of surface facets of hematite when adjusting the film orientation, the hematite photoanode films were fabricated by assembling the spherical particles with single crystalline nature. The doped hematite particles were aligned with (001) plane normal to the substrate by a magnetic field (MF) during the drop-casting process. A considerable improvement in photocurrent density was resulted from the orientation control, which is due to the increased carrier density from Sn doping and efficient charge transportation in the (001) plane observed through electrochemical impedance spectra.

Abstract: Cd-alloying CZTSSe (sulfur about 1%) film was prepared by selenizing CZTS precursor with CdS on the top. The XRD and Raman spectra indicated that Cd alloyed into CZTSSe lattice and the calculated Cd/(Cd+Zn) ratio was 0.13. Some small grains with increased Sn/Cu ratio existed near back contact. Grain growth enhanced after Cd alloying, resulting in a more homogenous Sn/Cu ratio along thickness direction. SIMS profile of solar cell confirmed Cd incorporation in bulk while also a higher Cd content near absorber surface. Corresponding to microstructure, electrical properties were also modified by Cd alloying. In the absorber bulk, the trap energy levels and density of Cd-alloying sample were 38meV and 1.47 ×1016cm−3, while 118meV and 6.98 ×1015cm−3 for reference sample. The dominant recombination was in bulk, instead of at interface as in reference sample. Back contact was improved owing to a smaller series resistance and a smaller rise of Rs at low temperature. J-V curve observed an improvement of Voc and Jsc. The EQE curve indicated sharper absorption edges and band gap reducing from 1.00eV to 0.95eV. As a consequence, a highest efficiency of 11.2% for CZTSSe solar cells was achieved.

Abstract: Hybrid perovskites have emerged over the past five years as absorber layers for novel high-efficiency low-cost solar cells which combine the advantages of organic and inorganic semiconductors. One of the main obstacles to their commercialization is their poor stability under light, humidity, oxygen, and high temperatures. In this work, we compare the optical and the electrical light-induced degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 (“MAPI”)-based solar cells using real-time ellipsometry measurements, electrical measurements and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) techniques. We evidence that while the electrical degradation takes place on a short time scale (2–3 days of exposure to ambient light conditions in a nitrogen atmosphere), no optical degradation is observed before 10 days when the dissociation reaction of methylammonium lead iodide starts acting. We find a very good agreement between XRD and ellipsometry measurements; both show the appearance of PbI2 after 1 week of exposure. We also confirm that the main mechanism at play is a light-induced degradation affecting the edges of the stack and the interfaces between the perovskite and the neighbouring layers. Last, a very good match is obtained on the optical constants of MAPI between our ellipsometry measurements and density functional theory calculations we performed, and we confirm the behavior of MAPI as an inorganic semiconductor.

Abstract: The improvement of polymer solar cell stability is a challenge for the scientists and has significant implications commercially. In this study, we investigated the stability of a novel P-SBTBDT active material applied in an inverted type solar cell. Detailed stability experiments comprising shelf life, laboratory weathering and outdoor testing were carried out according to ISOS testing guidelines. Shelf life showed that P-SBTBDT solar cells were very stable after 840h with encapsulation. Although accelerated weathering aging tests are a very harsh, the devices remained stable after the burn-in phase with T50 from 700 to 840h, with some P-SBTBDT solar cells did not reach T50 in the time span of the test. Degradation tests on the P-SBTBDT solar cells which were carried out under natural solar light indicated that T40 was reached after 840h. The results of dark, light, damp and dry stability tests showed that most of the degradation was provoked by failure of the encapsulation. The experiments indicated that P-SBTBDT solar cells are sensitive to light and oxygen but are strikingly stable under humid conditions. Further developments for minimizing the degradation effects using UV-filters and better encapsulation are some of the necessary improvements in further research.

Abstract: We report an 8µm-thick silicon solar cell with an efficiency of 9.60%. Nanostructured silicon surface formed via metal assisted etching shows a broadband reflection below 10%. Despite the excellent optical performance, a moderate short-circuit current (JSC) of 25.44mA/cm2 was collected. Relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE) at short wavelengths was associated with carrier recombination at the enhanced surface and by the Auger process. Moreover, parasitic absorption at the back contact is the main factor resulting a relatively low EQE in long wavelength region of the spectrum. Our optical simulations show that planarization of the rear Si surface and insertion of a low refractive index dielectric spacer between Si and the rear metal can significantly reduce the parasitic absorption in the metal, resulting in JSC values over 35mA/cm2.

Abstract: In this study, an inorganic mixture of 40wt% MgCl2·6H2O and 60wt% Mg(NO3)2·6H2O was impregnated into two types of the expanded graphite (EG): EG flakes and EG matrix. Different methods of preparation usually used in the organic composite preparation, such as direct blending, vacuum impregnation, ultrasonic impregnation and immersion were applied in this work. Considering the samples with EG matrix, it can be concluded that the optimal result of the encapsulation and ΔH ratio can be reached with the experimental time of 1, 3 and 4h using the vacuum, ultrasound and immersion methods, respectively. Moreover, the percentage of encapsulation increases with the experimental time and with the EG percentage for the EG matrix and for the EG flakes, respectively. Concerning the supercooling phenomena, the results show that the presence of EG reduces the difference between fusion and crystallization temperature for up to 65%, acting as а nucleating agent. The resulting composite samples (CPCM) were proved to have good latent heat and a significant reduction of the supercooling effect, which eliminates the need to use nucleating agents, that are essential for pure PCM of 40wt% MgCl2·6H2O and 60wt% Mg(NO3)2·6H2O. Moreover, using EG suppresses significantly the melting time which indicates the heat transfer enhance of the mixture. This circumstance could allow to empower the utilization of the mentioned mixture in different fields of thermal energy storage at low temperature.

Abstract: The CZTSSe/CdS interface qualities are vital aspects and factors that would greatly decide the photovoltaic performance of CZTSSe solar cells. High-quality CZTSSe/CdS interfaces could reduce defect density and improve CZTSSe device performance. However, due to the inhomogeneous CZTSSe grain growth in local micro-regions during selenization, void defects would emerge at the CZTSSe/CdS interfaces by traditional CdS deposition method. In order to obtain high-quality CZTSSe/CdS interfaces, a novel method of two-step CdS deposition, with which the two CdS layers were deposited before and after the selenization of CZTS absorbers, was firstly introduced in the work. The first CdS layer with a certain designed thickness was deposited onto the as-deposited CZTS thin films by CBD. Then the thin films were annealed in selenium-containing atmosphere to obtain CZTSSe thin films of large grain sizes. The second CdS layers with different thicknesses were deposited onto the annealed CZTSSe thin films by CBD again. Comparing with that by the traditional one-step CdS deposition method, the efficiencies of CZTSSe solar cells by two-step CdS deposition method show a remarkable increase from 7.25% to 10.19%. An action mechanism for improving device performance by two-step CdS deposition was proposed: The first CdS layer on CZTS precursors could consistently keep a well coverage for the CZTSSe grains on the surfaces during selenization; The second CdS layer could ensure p-n junctions in good condition, which would reduce recombination centers and shunting paths. The results suggest that the two-step CdS deposition process is an effective method to obtain high-quality CZTSSe/CdS interfaces and high-performance solar cell devices.

Abstract: In this work, a novel electrochromic device (ECD), consisting of phenyl viologen (PV) as the cathodically coloring material and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) as the stable radical provider for charge balance, was proposed. Nanofibers (NFs) obtained by electrospinning, using poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and poly(oxyethylene)-imide imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (POEI-IBF4), were introduced into the electrolyte to absorb tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate and propylene carbonate, so as to form a solid-state electrolyte for the ECD. The NFs were characterized by distribution of their diameters, or histograms, based on the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images; their physical properties, including electrolyte uptake, ionic conductivity, and porosity were studied. The proposed ECDs were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), UV–visible spectra, and dynamic transmittance curves. The pertinent N15P10-ECD exhibited a high transmittance change (ΔT) of 68.7% at 590nm, while maintaining a good cycling stability (95.5% of its original ΔT) after continuous 1000 switching cycles of operation at room temperature.

Abstract: Photovoltaic modules are subject to cyclic deformation during their lifetime as a result of vibration, applied loads, and thermal effects. Vibration and applied loads induce cyclic bending on the modules, while operating temperature excursions during the day lead mostly to cyclic axial deformation. In both cases, the region between two solar cells is severely stressed. For cyclic bending, cracks can nucleate near the points where busbars are soldered onto Silicon and might propagate due to fatigue. For cyclic axial deformation, on the other hand, busbars are stressed above the elastic regime and may experience plasticity and hysteretic energy dissipation. The present study focuses on the experimental characterization of such material degradation phenomena related to the above two types of cyclic deformation. For the former, fatigue crack growth in Silicon and its evolution have been quantified by using two independent nondestructive monitoring techniques based on electroluminescence and thermal infrared imaging. For the latter, plasticity and degradation of the material response of busbars has been assessed in relation to different applied cyclic strain levels. The obtained results shed light onto the cyclic response of materials used in photovoltaics, and pinpoint features that should be taken into account in the development of refined standard qualification tests for photovoltaics including cyclic deformation.

Abstract: Inspired by hydrothermal synthesis of inorganic crystallites, we apply one-step hydrothermal polymerization to directly grow polyaniline on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. In contrast to classical procedure that requires long reaction times and low temperature, hydrothermal polymerization allows for only 3h under hydrothermal condition. Investigation of the morphology via SEM suggests that PANI fiber aggregates uniformly on FTO substrate. The PANI film was used as electrochromic layer in an electrochromic device and the obtained PANI film shows high electrochromic performance. We believe that this study provided a novel way to directly grow PANI on FTO substrate and, thus, has some impact on the applications of other conjugated polymers in electrochromic and electrochemical devices.

Abstract: Colon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed and deadly cancer worldwide. Efforts have been made to characterize its pathological mechanisms and to explore new therapeutic targets of this disease. Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been associated with the pathogenesis of colon cancer. In the current study, we aimed to define the biological mechanism of the lncRNA BC200 in colon cancer. Here, we found that expression of BC200 was up-regulated in colon cancer tissues as compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The BC200 level was positively correlated with advanced TNM stage. The Kaplan–Meier method indicated that the cumulative survival rate was significantly lower in patients with high BC200 expression than in those with low BC200 expression. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of BC200 inhibited proliferation of HCT-116 and HT29 colon cancer cell lines and reduce the expression of cell proliferation markers, such as Ki-67 and PCNA. In addition, silencing of BC200 could induce obvious G0/G1 arrest and cause apoptosis in HCT-116 and HT29 cells and reduced the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and c-Myc through inhibiting the expression of β-catenin. Importantly, we found that knockdown of BC200 reduced invasion of HCT-116 and HT29 cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by reducing the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Mechanistically, silencing of BC200 significantly reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3. Overall, the findings presented here suggest that lncRNA BC200 may serve as a novel oncogene and a new therapeutic target for colon cancer.

Abstract: In the field of concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies, multilayer absorber coatings are widely being investigated. The spectral properties of selective coatings can be tailored by carefully adjusting the composition and thickness of each layer. Based on the extensive analysis using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), phase modulated spectroscopic ellipsometry along with computational study, we demonstrate how we can engineer the optical constants (refractive index and extinction coefficient) of individual layer to successfully achieve the spectrally selective properties in W/WAlN/WAlON/Al2O3 –based multilayer absorber coating. This coating exhibits a high absorptance of 0.958 and a low emittance of 0.08. The spectroscopic ellipsometry study confirmed the variation in metallic and optical properties of single layer of WAlN, WAlON and Al2O3 films, deposited on stainless steel substrates. This study also revealed the presence of intermediate layers of 26% WAlN – 74% WAlON at WAlN/WAlON interface and 60% WAlON – 40% Al2O3 at WAlON/Al2O3 interface. The Tauc - Lorentz dispersion model could effectively interpret the ellipsometry data of single layers of WAlN and Al2O3, while Cauchy absorbent model was useful for WAlON coating. Bruggeman effective medium approximation was used to describe the optical functions of intermediate layers. Investigation on optical constants reveals that the refractive index and extinction coefficient of each layer decrease from substrate to surface. The computational predictions of the reflectance properties corroborate well with the experimental results. In summary, the careful engineering of the optical properties in W/WAlN/WAlON/Al2O3 enables it to be an exceptional spectrally selective absorber coating.

Abstract: Polycomb chromobox (CBX) proteins are involved in gene silencing to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors through the polycomb repressive complex (PRC1). CBX4 has been implicated in the progression of human cancers, but its role and clinical significance in breast cancer remain unclear. Here, we show that CBX4 is up-regulated in breast cancer and exerts oncogenic activities via miR-137-mediated activation of Notch1 signaling pathway. CBX4 expression was increased in breast cancer, compared with the nontumorous tissues. High CBX4 expression was closely correlated with tumor metastasis, advanced clinical stage and poor overall survival in a cohort of 179 patients with breast cancer. In vitro studies demonstrated that CBX4 overexpression enhanced, whereas CBX4 knockdown inhibited cell growth and migration. Mechanistically, in a PRC1-dependent manner, CBX4 inhibited the promoter activity of miR-137 and suppressed its expression. miR-137 decreased the expression of Notch1, Jag1 and Hey2 via targeting their 3′-UTRs. The suppression of Notch1 by siRNA or overexpression of miR-137 markedly attenuated CBX4-promoted phenotypes. Collectively, these findings indicate that CBX4 promotes breast cancer via miR-137-mediated Notch1 signaling. Our data, therefore, suggest that CBX4 serve as a prognostic biomarker and that targeting CBX4/miR-137 axis may provide therapeutic potent in the treatment of breast cancer.

Abstract: In this work, a novel diode laser annealing was performed as a post-sulfurization heat treatment on pure-sulfide Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film solar cells fabricated by sputtering deposition. The effect on both film quality and device performance after annealing at various laser doses was investigated. After receiving an ultra-fast laser scan treatment, the crystallinity of the CZTS film can be improved and the Cu/Zn disordering is reduced. The power conversion efficiency of the laser annealed device was boosted to 7.33%, compared with the reference cell efficiency of 6.72%. The major increase in the short circuit current is driving force of such improvement, from 18mA/cm2 to 19.31mA/cm2 after laser treatment. These results indicate that the quality of CZTS thin films and the device performance can be effectively improved by the diode laser annealing.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. Persistent cervical infection by high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is related to cervical cancer. MicroRNAs could regulate autophagy caused by viral infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulation of autophagy by miR-155-5p in cervical cancer. In HPV+ human cervical lesion tissues, miR-155-5p expression was found to be markedly decreased. Compared to C33A cancer cells (HPV−), the miR-155-5p expression was significantly lower in Siha and HeLa cells (HPV+), which are both hrHPV positive. The level of autophagy was higher in C33A cells than in Siha and HeLa cells. In addition, in C33A, Siha and HeLa cervical cancer cells, miR-155-5p overexpression promoted autophagy, whereas miR-155-5p downregulation had the opposite effects. Furthermore, miR-155-5p downregulation suppressed LC3 and promoted P62 protein expression in C33A cells through promoting the PDK1/mTOR pathway, whereas miR-155-5p overexpression recovered LC3 and suppressed P62 protein expression by suppressing PDK1/mTOR signaling. Taken together, our results indicate the importance of miR-155-5p in cervical cancer cells and suggest a novel mechanism of hrHPV in promoting cervical lesions.

Abstract: Perovskite based solar cells such as orthorhombic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (OHP- CH3NH3PbI3) have shown extraordinary power conversion efficiencies exceeding 20%. Nevertheless, the macroscopic performances of these materials and the microscopic mechanism of the photovoltaic performance of OHP-CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells are not fully understood yet. For example, the fluctuation and orientation of CH3NH3+ cations and their impact on relevant processes such as charge recombination and exciton dissociation are still inadequately understood. By first-principles simulations, we show that the band gap and the transport properties of OHP-CH3NH3PbI3 can be controlled by using simple strain conditions. With the appropriate strain, e.g. 5% (tensile or compressive), the conduction type can be rotated from an n type to a p type and vice versa, depending on the kind of process (tension or compression). This can lead to creating materials and devices with huge control over their physical properties for a wide range of applications, ranging from photovoltaic to photocatalysis.

Abstract: Black nickel coatings exhibiting high infrared emittance were developed on copper and stainless steel substrates by pulse electrodeposition using a modified Fishlock bath. The uniform jet black coating is intended to provide passive thermal control of spacecraft components. Space worthiness of the coating was evaluated by conducting a series of space environmental tests such as humidity, thermal stability, thermal cycling and thermo-vacuum performance tests. The thermo-optical properties namely solar absorptance (α S) and infrared emittance (εIR) of the coatings were measured before and after each environmental test. No significant change in thermo-optical properties was observed after environmental tests showing their high stability for spacecraft thermal control applications. The coatings were characterized by cross-sectional SEM and EDX, XRD, XPS, Nanoindentation and Nano Vision analysis. X-ray diffraction pattern reveals the amorphous nature of the coating with possible presence of ZnS. XPS analysis confirms the chemical and electronic state of the elements. Average modulus and hardness of the coating was recorded using Nanoindentation method and a high resolution 3D image of the surface was generated using Nano Vision scan.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide, which has been demonstrated as negative differential thermal emissivity materials for emissivity engineering application, is regarded as the most important and promising material for adaptive infrared camouflage. This study describes the synthesis and characterization of high purity, uniform VO2 nanopowders by a single-step hydrothermal method and their thermal polymorphism. A dramatic phase transition of the monoclinic VO2 nanopowders to a tetragonal phase upon heating and the accompanying change in the IR emissivity are demonstrated. Importantly, we demonstrate the tunability of the infrared radiation intensity of VO2 nanopowders in both mid- and far-IR thermal atmospheric windows, for the first time. The structural transition is analyzed by variable temperature XRD and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, an unexpected structural change in the same region of the sample was observed in a transmission electron microscope, which provides a direct mechanistic understanding of the infrared emissivity variation. Our study makes a significant contribution to the state-of-the-art in thermal camouflaging, because this study demonstrates that the VO2 nanopowders can be extremely promising camouflage materials in the area of adaptive infrared camouflage technology both in the far-infrared and mid-infrared regions and the material is suitable for substrates with large surface areas and/or complex morphologies.

Abstract: In this paper, we report on the current status of absorber attributes in Liquid Phase Crystallized Silicon (LPC-Si) cells. To this end, an absorber doping series (ND = 2·1016/cm³ to 7·1017/cm³) and an absorber thickness variation (14 and 33µm) are evaluated. Best cells from the batches for these series showed open circuit voltages up to 640mV and fill factors above 70%. It is observed that for state-of-the-art cells, thicknesses over 15µm are not beneficial due to limited diffusion lengths. Lower absorber doping concentrations tend to yield longer intra-grain diffusion lengths (Ldiff) and better passivated grain boundaries, which may be due to lower impurity precipitation. The longer Ldiff leads to higher short circuit current densities which over-compensate a decrease in open circuit voltage and fill factor with regards to efficiency. Both front and rear surfaces are sufficiently passivated and at the current status the bulk lifetime has most potential for improvement.

Abstract: The temperature-pressure-composition phase diagrams of Sn-Se system were calculated using the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHase Diagram) models. The phase diagrams showed the formation of α-SnSe phase at selenium-rich side with pressures lower than atmospheric pressure and in the temperature range of 300–500°C. As a first step, the effect of Sn/Se ratio on the phase formation was studied experimentally by selenization of tin metal precursor films using effusion cell evaporation. The Sn/Se ratio was varied by changing the selenium weight in the range of 0.5–1.5g. The physical properties of the films were studied with suitable characterization techniques and the obtained results showed the formation of single phase α-SnSe at 1.0g of selenium. Further, α-SnSe/CdS interface was studied by photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS), which showed a ‘type-I’ band alignment with a valence-band offset (∆Ev) of 1.3eV and a conduction-band offset (∆Ec) of 0.2eV. Finally, α-SnSe solar cells with a device structure of soda-lime glass (SLG)/Mo/α-SnSe/CdS/i-ZnO/Al:ZnO/Ni/Ag were fabricated and a power conversation efficiency of 1.42% was achieved at 1.0g of selenium.
