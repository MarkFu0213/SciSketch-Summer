Abstract: The eukaryotic genome has an extremely complex spatial organization. The physical distances between regulatory elements of the genome, such as enhancers, promoters, insulators, and CpG-islands, do not necessarily reflect genomic distances. Some remote regulatory elements appear to interact physically with target promoters in the 3D nuclear space. These spatial contacts are thought to play a crucial role in the regulation of transcription. Recent studies performed using 3C (chromosome conformation capture)-based methods, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) coupled with confocal microscopy, and other experimental approaches have revealed that the spatial interactions of distant genomic elements within a folded chromosome are specific and functionally relevant. Additionally, the spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome is linked to the functional compartmentalization of the cell nucleus. In this review, we discuss the current state of research on the functional architecture of the eukaryotic genome. Special emphasis is given to the role of the spatial organization of the genome in establishing communication between enhancers and promoters. The driving forces of the juxtaposition of remote genomic elements are also considered.

Abstract: In this work we present large area p-type PERL solar cells featuring local p+ Back-Surface-Field (BSF) obtained by pico-second (ps) laser processing of thin ALD Al2O3 layers capped either by PECVD SiNx or PECVD SiOx. In this specific approach, the laser processing is performed through the rear passivation stack, whereby the laser simultaneously patterns the dielectrics for the subsequent Al–Si contact formation, whilst incorporating the Al atoms from the Al2O3 film into the underlying Si bulk. With this technique, we register substantial dopant incorporation for 10nm of ALD Al2O3, without using additional doping sources. When this process is coupled to a front metallization scheme based on Cu plating, p-PERL cells can be fabricated adopting only low temperature process steps, which avoids thermal stability issues related to the Al2O3 layer, such as crystallization and blistering, and improves the properties of the rear reflector by avoiding Al–Si alloying. Efficiencies up to 20.7% are reported on 6-in. Cz–Si solar cells featuring local p+ BSF formed by laser doping through a rear stack composed of 10nm ALD Al2O3 and 120nm PECVD SiNx.

Abstract: Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) is one of the most promising light-absorbing materials. The high-efficiency CIGS solar cells normally have included a CdS buffer layer deposited by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. To measure the thickness of the CBD–CdS, the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) system was introduced in this study. Using this system, the effect of the CdS thickness (reaction temperature versus reaction time), the impact of the reaction rate with constant thickness (reaction temperature versus thickness), and the characteristics of the CdS annealing effect were investigated. When the reaction time was fixed, the efficiency was affected by the thickness of CdS. Nevertheless, when the thickness of CdS was fixed in the thickness of the best efficiency, the reaction temperature did not affect it. By annealing the CdS film, the cell performance was improved. In the case of the sample with a low reaction temperature (60°C), the efficiency improvement was better than with different reaction temperatures because impurity of CdS was reduced more after the heat treatment. On the other hand, according to the XPS spectra, CdS with high temperatures had less impurity, so the annealing process had less impact on the efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents the thermo-physical properties and stability testing results of six high-temperature phase-change candidate materials for potential use as a cascaded storage system for concentrating solar power applications. This type of storage is a promising technology because it offers a higher utilization of the possible phase change and a more uniform heat-transfer fluid outlet temperature, compared with the single phase-change material (PCM) storage system. The tested materials were inorganic eutectic PCMs with reported phase-change temperatures between 300°C and 600°C. Four PCMs were made from carbonate salts (Na2CO3, K2CO3, and Li2CO3) and two from chloride salts (NaCl, MgCl2, and KCl). The phase-change temperature, phase-change enthalpy, and specific heat of these PCMs were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter. Large material samples were tested in an oven subjected to multiple melt–freeze cycles. The results showed that the carbonate PCMs have a very high degree of sub-cooling in the initial cycles, which decreased in subsequent cycles. The chloride PCMs have a negligible degree of sub-cooling. There is some disagreement between the measured and reported thermo-physical property values of the tested materials, which demonstrates the uncertainty associated with published property values. One carbonate PCM and one chloride PCM were recommended as promising latent heat storage materials.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn1−xGexS4 (CZTGS) thin films prepared by flash evaporation of a Zn-rich Cu2ZnSn0.5Ge0.5S4 bulk compound in powder form, and a subsequent thermal annealing in S containing Ar atmosphere are studied. The effect of the substrate temperature during evaporation and the initial composition of the precursor powder on the growth mechanism and properties of the final CZTGS thin film is investigated. The microstructure of the films and elemental depth profiles depend strongly on the growth conditions used. Incorporation of Ge into the Cu2ZnSnS4 lattice is demonstrated by the shift of the relevant X-ray diffraction peaks and Raman vibrational modes towards higher diffraction angles and frequencies respectively. A Raman mode at around 348–351cm−1 is identified as characteristic of CZTGS alloys for x=[Ge]/([Sn]+[Ge])=0.14−0.30. The supply of Ge enables the reduction of the Sn loss via a sacrificial Ge loss. This fact allows increasing the substrate temperature up to 350°C during the evaporation, forming a high quality kesterite material and, therefore, reducing the deposition process to one single stage.

Abstract: A new spectrally selective coating based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for solar thermal applications is demonstrated. For optimized coatings solar absorptance coefficients α>0.92 and thermal emittance coefficients ε<0.1 (400 °C) were achieved. These results render CNT coatings as a low cost and high performance alternative to commercially available vacuum deposited cermet coatings for concentrated solar power (CSP) application.

Abstract: Colloidal quantum-dot (QD) solar cells have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic techniques. Herein, we report an inverted PbS QD solar cells employing solution-processed CdS as the electron acceptor materials. Chemical bath deposition – one featuring ease of fabrication and compatibility with a low-temperature process – was employed to prepare CdS film on FTO glass, followed by deposition of PbS QDs as absorbing layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, thereby forming a depleted heterojunction structure. The results suggested that the thickness of CdS layer can be a key factor for determining the photovoltaic performance. After systematical optimization, an inverted FTO/CdS/PbS QDs/MoO3/Ag structure with an ultra-thin CdS film of 40nm delivered a decent power conversion efficiency of 5.22%. The maximum temperature is ~85°C via device fabrication demonstrates potential large-scale production process.

Abstract: In this work, we developed wafer bonding techniques to bond GaAs and Si wafers. Wafer bonding was carried out at room temperature without high temperature annealing processes. The bonded interface showed a low interface resistance of 8.8×10−3Ωcm2. We also exploited the new bonding techniques to fabricate a GaAs solar cell on a Si substrate. The solar cell showed a high energy conversion efficiency (13.25%) even without an anti reflection coating. The performance of the fabricated GaAs/Si solar cell was comparable to that of a homogeneous GaAs solar cell grown on a GaAs substrate. *Corresponding author.

Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport is an essential cellular activity and occurs via nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that reside in the double membrane of the nuclear envelope. Significant progress has been made during the past few years in unravelling the ultrastructural organization of NPCs and their constituents, the nucleoporins, by cryo-electron tomography and X-ray crystallography. Mass spectrometry and genomic approaches have provided deeper insight into the specific regulation and fine tuning of individual nuclear transport pathways. Recent research has also focused on the roles nucleoporins play in health and disease, some of which go beyond nucleocytoplasmic transport. Here we review emerging results aimed at understanding NPC architecture and nucleocytoplasmic transport at the atomic level, elucidating the specific function individual nucleoporins play in nuclear trafficking, and finally lighting up the contribution of nucleoporins and nuclear transport receptors in human diseases, such as cancer and certain genetic disorders.

Abstract: In this study, CZTSSe precursors (Se/Cu/SnS/ZnS) were deposited by sputtering and evaporation and then annealed without added chalcogen substances in an argon-filled atmospheric chamber using rapid thermal processing (RTP). A low-temperature pre-annealing treatment (PAT) was applied to induce a pre-reaction between Se and Cu/SnS/ZnS. It was found that the PAT leads to the formation of CuSe and Cu2−xSe and enhances Se incorporation during RTP chalcogenization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry, Raman analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) were applied to investigate the differences between the absorber with the PAT and the one without the PAT. Better morphologies on the surface and in the cross section were obtained for the CZTSSe absorber annealed using the PAT compared with the absorber annealed without the PAT. Both absorbers showed nearly pure kesterite phases in their upper regions, as confirmed by Raman analysis. However, STEM-EDS maps revealed that when the absorber was prepared without the PAT, Zn- and S-rich secondary phases and voids were easily formed near the back contact. The electrical characteristics and efficiencies of the CZTSSe thin films showed drastic changes; the CZTSSe solar cell without the PAT showed no diode response, but the cell with the PAT showed an efficiency of 6.77% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of 376mV, 31.39mA/cm2 and 57%, respectively.

Abstract: A novel AlHfN(H)/AlHfN(L) coating with tunable optical properties was designed and developed for high temperature solar thermal applications. The transition from absorber to antireflection behavior was achieved by varying the chemical composition of AlHfN coatings. The aluminum and hafnium target power densities and nitrogen flow rates were varied in order to attain the different chemical compositions of AlHfN layers, which resulted in different optical constant values. The ellipsometric measurements indicated that bottom AlHfN(H)) is the main absorber layer and the top AlHfN(L) acts as an antireflection coating. The AlHfN(H)/AlHfN(L) coating deposited on stainless steel (SS) substrates exhibited absorptance of 0.93 with an emittance of 0.13. In order to decrease the emittance, approximately 1μm thick tungsten coating was deposited on SS substrates. The tungsten coating acts as an infrared reflector due to which the emittance decreased drastically from 0.13 to 0.06, without affecting the absorptance. The optimized W/AlHfN(H)/AlHfN(L) coating deposited on SS substrates was thermally stable in air at 425°C for 2h. These coatings also exhibited high thermal stability in vacuum at 580°C for 260h.

Abstract: Novel heat transfer fluids with very low vapor pressure and high thermal stability are highly desirable for both high temperature direct solar collectors and concentrated solar collector. Herein a combined analytical and experimental study has been conducted on high temperature direct solar thermal collectors using graphene/ionic liquid nanofluids as the absorbers. A one-dimensional transient heat transfer model has been used to predict the receiver temperature and efficiency with varying parameters such as solar and graphene concentration and receiver height. The results show that the experimental temperature is in good agreement with numerical results under the same conditions. Based on the model, it is shown that the receiver efficiency increases with the solar concentration and receiver height, but decreases with the graphene concentration. The receiver efficiency could be maintained 0.7 under the conditions of 0.0005wt% of graphene in 5cm receiver under 20×1000Wm−2 at 600K. This work provided an important perspective to the graphene/ionic liquid nanofluids for use as a kind of novel heat transfer fluid in direct solar thermal collectors under concentrated solar incident radiation.

Abstract: The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its prodromal stage, pre-diabetes, is rapidly increasing among young men, leading to disturbances in testosterone synthesis. However, the impact of testosterone deficiency induced by these progressive stages of diabetes on the metabolic behavior of Sertoli cells remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of testosterone deficiency associated with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes on Sertoli cells metabolism, by measuring (1) the expression and/or activities of glycolysis and glycogen metabolism-related proteins and (2) the metabolite secretion/consumption in Sertoli cells obtained from rat models of different development stages of the disease, to unveil the mechanisms by which testosterone deregulation may affect spermatogenesis. Glucose and pyruvate uptake were decreased in cells exposed to the testosterone concentration found in pre-diabetic rats (600nM), whereas the decreased testosterone concentrations found in type 2 diabetic rats (7nM) reversed this profile. Lactate production was not altered, although the expression and/or activity of lactate dehydrogenase and monocarboxylate transporter 4 were affected by progressive testosterone-deficiency. Sertoli cells exposed to type 2 diabetic conditions exhibited intracellular glycogen accumulation. These results illustrate that gradually reduced levels of testosterone, induced by progressive stages of diabetes mellitus, favor a metabolic reprogramming toward glycogen synthesis. Our data highlights a pivotal role for testosterone in the regulation of spermatogenesis metabolic support by Sertoli cells, particularly in individuals suffering from metabolic diseases. Such alterations may be in the basis of male subfertility/infertility associated with the progression of diabetes mellitus.

MicroRNA-30c contributes to the development of hypoxia pulmonary hypertension by inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor receptor β expression,

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by excessive proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). MicroRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and might be implicated in the etiology of PAH. Data from in vivo and in vitro cell culture models showed that hypoxia inhibits microRNA-30c (miR-30c) expression in PASMCs. Inhibition of miR-30c by either hypoxia or AMO-30c results in PASMC proliferation (cell viability, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Ki67, and tubulin polymerization) and the inhibition of apoptosis (cell cycle progression, Cyclin A and Cyclin D, and TUNEL staining). Moreover, down-regulation of miR-30c also results in the phenotype switch from contractile to synthetic PASMC (SM22α and Calponin, osteopontin expression, and wound healing assay). In contrast, these effects were reversed by the application of an miR-30c mimetic under hypoxic conditions. Mechanically, miR-30c inhibited the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) expression by directly binding to the 3′ untranslated region of PDGFRβ mRNA (luciferase reporter assays, and PDGFRβ-masking antisense oligodeoxynucleotides). Pharmacological inhibition of PDGFR by AG-1296 displayed similar effects to the miR-30c mimetic. These data suggest that the down-regulation of miR-30c accounts for the up-regulation of PDGFRβ expression, and subsequent activation of PDGF signaling results in the hypoxia-induced PASMC proliferation and phenotype switching. Therefore, increasing miR-30c expression levels could be explored as a potential new therapy for hypoxia-induced PAH.

Abstract: The Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CD97/ADGRE5 is induced, upregulated, and/or biochemically modified in various malignancies, compared to the corresponding normal tissues. As tumor cells are generally more resistant to apoptosis, we here studied the ability of CD97 to regulate tumor cell survival under apoptotic conditions. Stable overexpression of wild-type CD97 reduced serum starvation- and staurosporine-induced intrinsic and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cycloheximide-induced extrinsic apoptosis, indicated by an increase in cell viability, a lower percentage of cells within the subG0/G1 phase, expressing annexin V, or having condensed nuclei, and a reduction of DNA laddering. Protection from cell death by CD97 was accompanied by an inhibition of caspase activation and modulation of anti- and pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 superfamily. shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD97 and, in part, truncation of the seven-span transmembrane (TM7) region of CD97 increased caspase-mediated apoptosis. Protection from apoptosis required not only the TM7 region but also cleavage of the receptor at its GPCR proteolysis site (GPS), whereas alternative splicing of its extracellular domain had no effect. Together, our data indicate a role of CD97 in tumor cell survival.

Abstract: Our previous studies demonstrated that inflammation exacerbates the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the role of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in NAFLD under conditions of inflammation. Chronic inflammation was induced by using subcutaneous injections of 10% casein in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice in vivo and interleukin-1β stimulation of the HepG2 hepatoblastoma cell line in vitro. Results demonstrated that inflammation increased lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and in livers of apolipoprotein E knockout mice. These effects were correlated with an increase in low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene transcription, which was mediated through the up-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), SREBP-2, and through enhanced translocation of the SCAP/SREBP-2 complex from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi. In addition, our data indicated that inflammation down-regulated the expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) and prevented the degradation of LDLR protein via posttranscriptional mechanisms. Further analysis showed that inflammation increased the protein phosphorylation of mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, and p70 S6 kinase. Interestingly, blocking mTORC1 activity inhibited the translocation of SCAP/SREBP-2 complex from the ER to the Golgi and decreased the expression of LDLR, SCAP, and SREBP-2. These effects were accompanied by an increase in the expression of PCSK9 and accelerated LDLR degradation. Our findings demonstrated that increased mTORC1 activity exacerbated the progression of NAFLD by disrupting LDLR expression via transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.

Abstract: A novel 56 π-electron fullerene acceptor material, benzocyclobutene-C60 bisadducts (BCBCBA), was developed via the [2+2] cycloaddition of in-situ generated benzyne with C60 to raise the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the fullerene. This four-membered linkages to C60 of BCBCBA resulted in the fullerene bisadducts with very addends, thus minimizing the adverse effects of their regioisomers on the intermolecular packing between fullerene bisadducts. In addition, the LUMO level of BCBCBA was as high as −3.70eV, which is 0.16eV higher than that of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (−3.86eV). This result indicates the significant potential for improving open-circuit voltage (VOC) values in polymer solar cells (PSCs). The poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):BCBCBA based PSCs show VOC of 0.73 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.51%, which are similar to the P3HT:bis-PCBM based PSCs.

Abstract: Hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells with planar heterostructure based on hydrothermal-synthesized CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) array and organometal trihalide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 have been fabricated and characterized. Thermal annealing and Ultraviolet Ozone (UV–Ozone) treatment were applied to modify the surface of the CdS NRs, in which UV–Ozone treatment was proved to be more effective in improving the morphology of perovskite layer, as well as the charge transfer between CH3NH3PbI3 and CdS NRs. Devices structured as ITO/CdS NRs array/CH3NH3PbI3/2,29,7,79-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,99-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD)/MoO3/Ag produced short-circuit current density of 18.77mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage of 0.89V, and fill factor of 49.9%, leading to a best power conversion efficiency of 8.36% in the case of 10min UV–Ozone treatment.

Abstract: A novel eutectic composition in the LiF–Na2CO3–K2CO3 ternary system was predicted using thermodynamic modeling based on Gibbs energy of fusion and designed for thermal energy storage or metal heat treatment. The Differential Calorimetry Scanning (DSC) technique was used to experimentally measure the melting point of the eutectic composition in the ternary system which was determined to be 694.40K. Heat capacity of the eutectic composition of the ternary system was also measured using DSC from solid to liquid state and the results were plotted as function of temperature. The upper temperature limit for thermal stability of the eutectic mixture was determined in different atmospheres using the Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA). The high upper temperature limit for thermal stability ensures the large working temperature range of the LiF–Na2CO3–K2CO3 ternary system. Thermal conductivity of the ternary system was also studied by using a simplified inverse method. The relatively high thermal conductivity indicates its high efficiency of energy storage. Based on the measured thermodynamic properties, physical properties and its high energy storage density, this ternary system can be used as heat transfer fluid for thermal energy storage application.

Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigated the plasmonic effects of silver nanoplates (Ag NPLs) embedded in organic and perovskite (PVSK) photovoltaic (PV) cells. Optical properties of the Ag NPLs were manipulated by varying their sizes and shapes through controllable wet chemical processes. As the lengths of the edges of the Ag NPLs increased, their surface plasmon resonance bands broadened, with the maximum extinction wavelength extending to as far as 750nm. After embedding various types of Ag NPLs into the PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrenesulfonate] layer, the short-circuit photocurrent density increased by 7.6–17.5%, relative to that of the pre-optimized control PVs, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing by up to 13%. We obtained an optimized PCE of 8.5% for normal PVSK device under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100mWcm−2). After the incorporation of Ag NPLs, a much higher PCE of 9.6% was obtained. External quantum efficiencies were increased significantly as a result of the increased plasmonic scattering effect of Ag NPLs.

Abstract: Caveolae are specialized small plasma-membrane invaginations that play crucial cellular functions. Two essential protein families are required for caveola formation: membrane caveolin proteins and cytoplasmic cavin proteins. Each family includes members with specific tissue distribution, and their expression is altered under physiological and pathological conditions, implying highly specialized functions. Cavins not only stabilize caveolae, but modulate their morphology and functions as well. Before association with the plasma membrane, cavins form homo- and hetero-oligomers with strikingly strict stoichiometry in the cytosol. At the plasma membrane, they provide an outer peripheral cytosolic layer, necessary for caveola stability. Interestingly, upon stimulation, cavins can be released from caveolae into the cytoplasm in distinct subcomplexes, providing a rapid dynamic link between caveolae and cellular organelles including the nucleus. In this review, we detail the biology of cavins, their structural and functional roles, and their implication in pathophysiology.

Abstract: A composite film containing uniform nano-crystallized carbon (nc-C) embedded in titanium oxide (TiO2) matrix has been fabricated by a facile sol–gel technique as selective solar absorbers. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the nc-C grains, whose size ranges from 2nm to 10nm, make up a crosslinked network. The structural template (polyethylene glycol) used in the present work could tune the carbon contents of the composite films. The optimized solar absorptance and thermal emittance of the single layer film on copper substrate were about 0.939 and 0.195, respectively. The little deterioration after aging test (at 500°C for 30h in vacuum) demonstrated an outstanding durability of nc-C/TiO2 nano-composite films. Further investigations on the structure and solar selective properties revealed that both excellent optical performance and structural stabilities benefit from nc-C and nano-composite effects. Therefore, this nc-C/TiO2 film has been proved to be a good candidate for solar selective absorbers.

Abstract: Trophoblast cells express a singular miRNA expression profile which varies during pregnancy and whose alteration may be associated with pregnancy complications. miR-21, a widely known oncomir, is highly expressed in human placenta but its role in regulating trophoblast cells remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate miR-21 functions and targets in HTR-8/SVneo immortalized trophoblast and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells, which are trophoblast cell models that differ in their cellular origin. Cells were transfected with miR-21-antagomir, -mimic or their respective controls. Following, cell proliferation (BrdU), migration (Transwell and scratch wound-healing assays), invasion (Matrigel assays) and apoptosis (flow cytometry, TUNEL assay and Western blotting) were assessed. Expression of the potential miR-21 targets phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) were analyzed by Western blotting. Inhibition of miR-21 decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells and additionally, induced apoptosis in JEG-3 cells. Silencing of miR-21 enhanced PDCD4 expression only in JEG-3 cells, and PTEN expression only in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Inhibition of miR-21 significantly increased phosphorylation of AKT in HTR-8/SVneo cells. In conclusion, miR-21 has cell-specific targets depending upon the origin of trophoblastic cells. Furthermore, miR-21 regulates major cellular processes including cell growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis suggesting that its impairment may lead to placental disorders.

Abstract: In this study, a series of binary mixtures of Adipic acid (AA) and Sebacic acid (SA) at various mass fractions were prepared. A binary mixture of AA and SA in the ratio of 48.0:52.0wt% was shown to be an eutectic mixture with melting temperature of 116°C, melting latent heat of 206.0Jg−1. In order to improve thermal properties of AA–SA eutectic mixture, multilayer graphite nanoplates (GNP) at different mass fractions (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5wt%) was loaded into AA–SA mixture. The loading of 0.5wt% GNP decreased the extent of supercooling from 17.7 to 3.6°C. GNP loading did not change the thermal stability, functional groups and crystallographic properties of AA–SA eutectic mixture. Thermal conductivity of AA–SA was improved by GNP loading. Besides, morphological properties of GNP loaded AA–SA were examined by scanning electron microscopy observations. Thermal reliability of the AA–SA eutectic mixtures was investigated at different thermal cycles. Eutectic mixture of AA–SA containing GNP of 0.1 and 0.5wt% showed relatively smaller variations in melting temperature and freezing temperatures.

Abstract: Autophagy is considered as an innate defense mechanism primarily due to its role in the targeting of intracellular pathogens for lysosomal degradation. Here we report inhibition of autophagy as an adaptive response in classically activated macrophages that helps achieve high cellular ROS production and cell death—another hallmark of innate mechanisms. We show prolonged classical activation of Raw 264.7 macrophages by treating them with IFN-γ and LPS inhibited autophagy. The inhibition of autophagy was dependent on nitric oxide (NO) production which activated the AKT-mTOR signaling, the known negative regulators of autophagy. Autophagy inhibition in these cells was accompanied with a shift to aerobic glycolysis along with a decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MOMP). The decline in MOMP coupled with autophagy inhibition led to increased mitochondrial content and considerably elevated cellular ROS, eventually causing cell death. Next, using specific siRNA mediated knockdowns we show AKT was responsible for the glycolytic shift and autophagy inhibition in activated macrophages. Surprisingly, AKT knockdown in activated macrophages also rescued them from cell death. Finally we show that AKT mediated autophagy inhibition in the activated macrophages correlated with the depletion of glucose from the extracellular medium, and glucose supplementation not only rescued autophagy levels and reversed other phenotypes of activated macrophages, but also inhibited cell death. Thus we report here a novel link between AKT mediated glycolytic metabolism and autophagy in the activated macrophages, and provide a possible mechanism for sustained macrophage activation in vivo.

Abstract: Carrier-selective contacts are one of the key enabling technologies to approach very high conversion efficiencies close to the theoretical limit of silicon solar cells. The tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) approach is an alternative to classical heterojunction solar cells enabling efficiencies up to 24.4%. The tunnel oxide is a core element of this contact as it has to reduce the minority carrier recombination but simultaneously must not hamper the majority carrier flow. This paper focuses on ozone-based oxidation techniques, which can potentially be cost effective and industrially feasible methods for the realization of ultra-thin tunnel oxide layers as an alternative to the oxidation in nitric acid (HNO3) reference process. All investigated oxides were applied to the electron-selective contact (n-TOPCon) on planar and textured surfaces. It will be shown that both ozone based oxidation techniques (UV/O3 photo-oxidation and wet-chemical oxidation in ozonized DI-H2O) enable high implied open circuit voltage (iVOC) values exceeding 720mV on planar and 710mV on textured surfaces, respectively. Further oxide properties as stoichiometry and layer thickness were analyzed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), spectral ellipsometry (SE) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In compliance with earlier results it was found that a minimum oxide layer thickness (approximately 1.3nm) and a high amount of oxygen-rich sub oxide species are required to obtain a good surface passivation. Using such oxides, a wider range of temperatures can be used during the TOPCon annealing. Applying the ozone-based oxide layers to n-TOPCon solar cells resulted in a high VOC of up to 719mV and a peak efficiency of 24.9%. Similar results were obtained with the HNO3 reference process (VOC=716mV, η=24.8%).

Abstract: Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) are a known failure mode in a variety of thin film photovoltaic (PV) devices, through mechanisms such as resistivity increase and delamination. Degradation science studies of these materials, as well as most PV systems, have primarily utilized industry standard qualification protocols, which are not designed to be used as lifetime prediction tests. This work applies a data science approach to this engineering challenge, utilizing commercially available TCOs and subjecting them to an array of stressors, including environmental and material stressors. Optical, electrical and surface sensitive TCO property metrics were monitored and analyzed en mass. Different degradation mechanisms and modes were observed when different stressor combinations were applied; TCO surfaces are sensitive to the proportion of water and light in an exposure, yellowing of the TCO only occurs when humidity and UV light are combined, and PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate)) application results in hazing and roughening of aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO). Using multi-variate analytics and plotting critical material properties against one another in a mechanistic plot, trade-offs between properties and the activation of different degradation mechanisms become readily apparent. In addition to a survey of failure modes of TCOs, a possible solution to the degradation of AZO was examined: the application of an organofunctional silane layer. The application of a thin APTES (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) film nearly eliminated the observed edge effects and greatly reduced the resistivity increase caused by damp heat exposure of AZO.

Abstract: Graded composition CdxZn1−xTe films were prepared by growing several alternate layers of CdTe and ZnTe by the Isothermal Close Space Sublimation technique. The thickness of both kinds of layers was modified along the structure to produce an increase of the average concentration of CdTe towards the surface of the films. Due to Zn/Cd inter-diffusion during the growth process the sequence of layers was converted into a relatively smooth graded composition film. According to X-ray diffraction characterization the layers grew coherently with the (100) oriented GaAs substrates although they showed a relatively high mosaicity. θ−2θ plots show very wide diffraction peaks as expected from variable composition samples. The band gap grading effect in light absorption was also verified through transmission measurements, using transparent substrates. Graded composition profiles of the thin films were confirmed by x-ray photoelectron and secondary ion mass spectroscopies. Moreover, quantitative Cd, Zn and Te profiles were obtained by the analysis of Rutherford backscattering spectra of the samples. This analysis showed a CdTe molar fraction profile ranging from approximately x=0.8 at the surface of the sample and x=0.35 at the interface with the substrate. The possibility of growing graded composition layers using a simple and cost-effective procedure was demonstrated. This could be interesting in technological applications like CdxZn1−xTe layers of variable composition in CdS/CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: Excessive proliferation of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) is one of the major factors that trigger vascular remodeling in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Several studies have implicated that hypoxia inhibits the tumor suppressor p21 (CDKN1A). However, the precise mechanism is unknown. The mouse model of hypoxia-induced PH and in vitro experiments were used to assess the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) on the expression of CDKN1A. In these experiments, the miRNA family miR-130 was identified to regulate the expression of CDKN1A. Transfection of HPASMC with miR-130 decreased the expression of CDKN1A and, in turn, significantly increased smooth muscle proliferation. Conversely, inhibition of miR-130 by anti-miRs and seed blockers increased the expression of CDKN1A. Reporter gene analysis proved a direct miR-130–CDKN1A target interaction. Exposure of HPASMC to hypoxia was found to induce the expression of miR-130 with concomitant decrease of CDKN1A. These findings were confirmed in the mouse model of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension showing that the use of seed blockers against miR-130 restored the expression of CDKN1A. These data suggest that miRNA family miR-130 plays an important role in the repression of CDKN1A by hypoxia. miR-130 enhances hypoxia-induced smooth muscle proliferation and might be involved in the development of right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract: The use of low-emissivity (low-e) coatings in the context of architectural glazings allows for a significant reduction in energy consumption by limiting the amount of transmitted thermal radiation. However, in countries with variable seasons, the passive nature of low-e coatings limits energy savings and, consequently, chromogenic (active) materials which offer variable transmittance in the visible and near-IR, are a promising avenue. In this work, we study sputtered amorphous tungsten oxide (WO3) films deposited at different pressures in order to control the films' porosity. Using a H2SO4 electrolyte, cyclic voltammetry combined with simultaneous transmission measurements and, more importantly, in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements during chrono-amperometry show that lowering the packing density is associated with a faster charge insertion, lower charge trapping, and higher transmittance modulation. In order to gain more insight into the films' performance and their coloration and bleaching dynamics, the optical properties of the HxWO3 layers are obtained for different intercalation levels. Furthermore, this approach allows one to observe and better understand the electrochromic behavior, as well as the materials' aging and cyclability based on the observation of the dissolution of the films, their increase in roughness, and presence of residual absorption. Finally, the obtained dispersion curves are used to model bi-layer systems consisting of dense and porous HxWO3 films, paving the way for future modeling and optimization of multilayer electrochromic interference filters.

Abstract: We present a life cycle analysis (LCA) and an environmental impact analysis (EIA) of lead based perovskite solar cells prepared according to the two most successfully reported literature methods that comprise either vapour phase deposition or solution phase deposition. We have developed the inventory for all the components employed for the two different device architectures that resemble respectively a traditional dye sensitised solar cell (DSSC) and an inverted polymer solar cell (OPV). We analyse the impacts from generation of 1kWh of electricity and assume a lifetime of 1 year in the analysis and further present a sensitivity analysis with the operational lifetime as a basis. We find that the major impact comes from the preparation of the perovskite absorber layer due to the electrical energy required in the manufacture and also make the striking observation that the impact of toxic lead(II)halides is very limited compared to methylammoniumhalides employed. This applies during the raw materials extraction, synthesis of the starting materials and manufacture of the perovskite solar cells and from these points of view the lead based perovskite solar cells do not pose extra concerns when compared to contending solar cell technologies in the cradle-to-gate scenario considered here. The environmental impact of the perovskite solar cells in the operational phase and the decommissioning phase representing a cradle-to-grave analysis is not currently possible and will have to await large scale outdoor demonstration where emission to the environment during the operation and decommissioning phase can be measured. The main conclusion is that in the cradle-to-gate analysis there are no compelling reasons to dismiss lead based perovskites as a solar cell technology.

Abstract: Light scattering in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) plays a vital role in extending the traveling distance by confining light propagation within the photoanode and also promotes interaction of incident photons with the dye molecules. A novel strategy was adopted to improve the performance of DSSC with better absorption of solar spectrum both in the visible as well as near IR regions. A double layer photoanode structure with TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) as main layer and composite of titanium nanotubes (TNTs) and P25 as over-layer was introduced. Three different compositions of TNT/P25 were investigated, and finally an optimized composition with excellent performance was prepared. Performance of cells having composite over-layer was compared with the cells having TNT and conventional bigger particles (G2) over-layers. Composite over-layer structure of 75/25-TNT/P25 showed best photovoltaic performance of 8.52% with Jsc of 16.49mA/cm2, which is 7.30% higher than the cells having G2 over-layer and 4.9% higher than the cells having pure TNT over-layer. Different characterization analysis proved that DSSC with optimized composite over-layer structure has significant advantages of better dye adsorption, large surface area, better photo-electron generation, superior electron recombination restraint characteristics, better conductive behavior, better light scattering, and long electron lifetime. Composite over-layer structure is a promising and innovative approach for further improving the efficiency of DSSC and this will be a concrete fundamental background toward the development of the applications of the next generation dye-sensitized solar cells.

Abstract: The epithelium of asthmatics is characterized by reduced expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of the basal cell markers ck-5 and p63 that is indicative of a relatively undifferentiated repairing epithelium. This phenotype correlates with increased proliferation, compromised wound healing and an enhanced capacity to undergo epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The transcription factor β-catenin plays a vital role in epithelial cell differentiation and regeneration, depending on the co-factor recruited. Transcriptional programs driven by the β-catenin/CBP axis are critical for maintaining an undifferentiated and proliferative state, whereas the β-catenin/p300 axis is associated with cell differentiation. We hypothesized that disrupting the β-catenin/CBP signaling axis would promote epithelial differentiation and inhibit EMT. We treated monolayer cultures of human airway epithelial cells with TGFβ1 in the presence or absence of the selective small molecule ICG-001 to inhibit β-catenin/CBP signaling. We used western blots to assess expression of an EMT signature, CBP, p300, β-catenin, fibronectin and ITGβ1 and scratch wound assays to assess epithelial cell migration. Snai-1 and -2 expressions were determined using q-PCR. Exposure to TGFβ1 induced EMT, characterized by reduced E-cadherin expression with increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin and EDA-fibronectin. Either co-treatment or therapeutic administration of ICG-001 completely inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT. ICG-001 also reduced the expression of ck-5 and -19 independent of TGFβ1. Exposure to ICG-001 significantly inhibited epithelial cell proliferation and migration, coincident with a down regulation of ITGβ1 and fibronectin expression. These data support our hypothesis that modulating the β-catenin/CBP signaling axis plays a key role in epithelial plasticity and function.

Abstract: Around 60–80% of all breast tumors are estrogen receptor-positive. One of the several therapeutic approaches used for this type of cancers is the use of aromatase inhibitors. Exemestane is a third-generation steroidal aromatase inhibitor that undergoes a complex and extensive metabolism, being catalytically converted into chemically active metabolites. Recently, our group showed that the major exemestane metabolites, 17β-hydroxy-6-methylenandrosta-1,4-dien-3-one and 6-(hydroxymethyl)androsta-1,4,6-triene-3,17-dione, as well as, the intermediary metabolite 6β-Spirooxiranandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione, are potent aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer cells. In this work, in order to better understand the biological mechanisms of exemestane in breast cancer and the effectiveness of its metabolites, it was investigated their effects in sensitive and acquired-resistant estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that metabolites induced, in sensitive breast cancer cells, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway, involving caspase-8 activation. Moreover, metabolites also induced autophagy as a promoter mechanism of apoptosis. In addition, it was demonstrated that metabolites can sensitize aromatase inhibitors-resistant cancer cells, by inducing apoptosis. Therefore, this study indicates that exemestane after metabolization originates active metabolites that suppress the growth of sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells. It was also concluded that, in both cell lines, the biological effects of metabolites are different from the ones of exemestane, which suggests that exemestane efficacy in breast cancer treatment may also be dependent on its metabolites.

Abstract: Dendrites are the entry site of neural signals into neurons. Once formed, dendrites are not just the same in structure but rather are dynamically remodeled in vivo: some dendrites are pruned away, while others lengthen and branch out. Dendritic remodeling occurs not only during neural development, but also in mature dendrites under both physiological and pathological conditions, suggesting its contribution to neural plasticity. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remained poorly understood until recently, but they are just beginning to be elucidated from recent studies on invertebrate model systems. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how dendrites are remodeled by focusing particularly on insights obtained from Drosophila sensory neurons.

Abstract: Defects in ciliary assembly, maintenance, and signaling are associated with various human diseases and developmental disorders, termed ciliopathies. Eukaryotic flagella and cilia (interchangeable terms) are microtubule-based organelles. Thus, microtubule dynamics and microtubule-dependent transport are predicted to affect the structural integrity and functionality of cilia profoundly. Kinesin-2 is well known for its role in intraflagellar transport to transport ciliary precursors and signaling molecules. Recently, microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins found in kinesin-8, -13, and -14A families have emerged as regulators of cilia. We first discuss ciliary kinesins identified in the flagellar or ciliary proteome, and then focus on the function and regulation of microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins. Lastly, we review the recent advances of microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins in controlling ciliary assembly, disassembly, and length.

Abstract: An interfacial layer and active layer were simultaneously fabricated through a facile one-step process using a blended solution of zinc oxide (ZnO) sol-gel as the interfacial material, and P3HT:PCBM (poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric methyl ester) as the photoactive components. The resultant devices based on the one-step process exhibited a favourable 3.56% power conversion efficiency (PCE) after a simple UV light treatment, close to the PCE of a conventionally fabricated reference device with a multilayer architecture. Using a combination of surface morphology analysis and investigation of the vertical component distribution, we confirmed that a spontaneous and significant phase separation between the ZnO and the photoactive materials occurred during the spin coating and sequential thermal annealing processes. This resulted in the automatic formation of an enriched ZnO interfacial layer at the ITO surface. The work function of the ZnO layer deposited by the one-step process on the ITO substrate was 3.76eV, consistent with conventionally formed ZnO layers. Furthermore, the performance of the device fabricated by the one-step process demonstrated superior stability under light exposure. This successful demonstration of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) using the one-step process is an important step towards the realization of high performance, roll-to-roll compatible OPVs.

Abstract: Reaction path for fabrication of Cu2SnSe3 (CTSe) film by selenization of Cu–Sn precursor was investigated via in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as glazing incident XRD (GIXRD) measurements. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses revealed the element and phase distribution along the depth direction. Based on these results, a proposed growth model was concluded below: first, the Se atoms from evaporation source reacted with Cu and Sn atoms to produce Cu2−xSe and SnSe2 phases. Noticeably, resulting film presented bilayer feature with Cu2−xSe located at the surface and SnSe2 located at bottom. Second, CTSe phase formed at the interface of Cu2−xSe and SnSe2 as the increasing temperature. The Cu2−xSe was depleted by Sn-related secondary phases when the Cu/Sn ratio was smaller than 1.72. The secondary phases of SnSe2 and SnSe were coexisted with CTSe phase independent of Cu/Sn ratio in metallic precursor, which was attributed to the weak diffusion ability of Sn and Sn-related secondary phases in the CTSe film. The origins for high carrier concentration in CTSe films were ascribed to the Cu2−xSe and intrinsic acceptor concentration and effective approach to reduce the value was explored. An attempt of solar cell with CTSe as absorber was performed and photocurrent of 9.9mA/cm2 was detected.

Abstract: Voltage-gated EAG2 channel is abundant in the brain and enhances cancer cell growth by controlling cell volume. The channel contains a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology (CNBH) domain and multiple calmodulin-binding motifs. Here we show that a raised intracellular Ca2+ concentration causes proteolytic digestion of heterologously expressed and native EAG2 channels. A treatment of EAG2-expressing cells with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 for 1h reduces the full-length protein by ∼80% with a concomitant appearance of 30–35-kDa peptides. Similarly, a treatment with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin for 3h removes 30–35-kDa peptides from ∼1/3 of the channel protein. Moreover, an incubation of the isolated rat brain membrane with CaCl2 leads to the generation of fragments with similar sizes. This Ca2+-induced digestion is not seen with EAG1. Mutations in a C-terminal calmodulin-binding motif alter the degrees and positions of the cleavage. Truncated channels that mimic the digested proteins exhibit a reduced current density and altered channel gating. In particular, these shorter channels lack a rapid activation typical in EAG channels with more than 20-mV positive shifts in voltage dependence of activation. The truncation also eliminates the ability of EAG2 channel to reduce cell volume. These results suggest that a sustained increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration leads to proteolytic cleavage at the C-terminal cytosolic region following the CNBH domain by altering its interaction with calmodulin. The observed Ca2+-induced proteolytic cleavage of EAG2 channel may act as an adaptive response under physiological and/or pathological conditions.

Abstract: In this article, we report on the low-temperature deposition of textured back reflectors using sputtered ZnO:Al/Ag/Al:Si layers in flexible nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) thin-film solar cells. The surface morphology of this multilayer system depends on that of the Al:Si bottom layers, whereas its optical properties are determined by the Ag and ZnO:Al films deposited on top of the Al:Si layers. The nc-Si:H thin-film solar cells fabricated on textured ZnO:Al/Ag/Al:Si multilayer back reflectors showed an enhanced spectral response for wavelengths between 650nm and 1100nm when compared with cells with flat multilayer back reflectors. A high conversion efficiency of 7.25% was successfully achieved for a solar cell with a moderately textured ZnO:Al/Ag/Al:Si multilayer back reflector with a root-mean-square roughness (σrms) of 30.2nm deposited at low substrate temperature of 75°C in which an additional current gain of 2mA/cm2 was obtained by effective light scattering from the textured surface without any reduction in the open circuit voltage and the fill factor compared with a solar cell with the flat multilayer back reflector with σrms=9.13nm. This result confirms that textured ZnO:Al/Ag/Al:Si multilayer back reflectors prepared at a low substrate temperature of 75°C can be used in flexible silicon thin-film solar cells using polymeric substrates with low heat resistance.

Abstract: Plasma lipoproteins are a source of lipids for the heart, and the proportion of electronegative low density lipoprotein [LDL(−)] is elevated in cardiometabolic diseases. Perilipin 5 (Plin5) is a crucial protein for lipid droplet management in the heart. Our aim was to assess the effect of LDL(−) on intracellular lipid content and Plin5 levels in cardiomyocytes and to determine whether these effects were influenced by hypoxia. HL-1 cardiomyocytes were exposed to native LDL [LDL(+)], LDL(−), and LDL(+) enriched in non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) by phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated lipolysis [PLA2-LDL(+)] or by NEFA loading [NEFA-LDL(+)] under normoxia or hypoxia. LDL(−), PLA2-LDL(+) and NEFA-LDL(+) raised the intracellular NEFA and triglyceride (TG) content of normoxic cardiomyocytes. Plin5 was moderately upregulated by LDL(+) but more highly upregulated by LDL(−), PLA2-LDL(+) and NEFA-LDL(+) in normoxic cardiomyocytes. Hypoxia enhanced the effect of LDL(−), PLA2-LDL(+) and NEFA-LDL(+) on intracellular TG and NEFA concentrations but, in contrast, counteracted the upregulatory effect of these LDLs on Plin5. Fluorescence microscopy experiments showed that hypoxic cardiomyocytes exposed to LDL(−), PLA2-LDL(+) and NEFA-LDL(+) have an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). By treating hypoxic cardiomyocytes with WY-14643 (PPARα agonist), Plin5 remained high. In this situation, LDL(−) failed to enhance intracellular NEFA concentration and ROS production. In conclusion, these results show that Plin5 deficiency in hypoxic cardiomyocytes exposed to LDL(−) dramatically increases the levels of unpacked NEFA and ROS.

Abstract: A persistent photoconductivity effect (PPC) has been investigated in Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films and solar cells as a function of temperature. An anomalous increase of the PPC decay time with temperature was observed in all samples. The PPC decay time activation energy was found to increase when temperature rises above a crossover value, and also to grow with the increase of the sulfurization temperature and pressure. Both the anomalous behavior of the PPC decay time and the existence of two different activation energies are explained in terms of local potential fluctuations in the band edges of CZTS.

Abstract: Osteogenesis disorder is involved in osteoporosis and other related bone diseases, in which osteogenic differentiation is essential. Osteogenic differentiation is a complicated process regulated by intricate signal transduction networks. It has been reported that low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) has an osteogenic potential by promoting osteoblast differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be understood. In this study, we reveal a novel mechanism that Akt/GSK3β/TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in LPLI-enhanced osteoblast differentiation. Photomodulation by LPLI activated Akt/GSK3β pathway which inhibited TAZ phosphorylation, leading to the increase of TAZ protein level and nuclear aggregation. Meanwhile, knockdown of TAZ suppressed osteogenic differentiation promoted by LPLI. Further study showed that LPLI promoted the interaction between TAZ and core-binding factor 1 (Cbfa1), up-regulating the transcription of osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). However, inhibition of Akt/GSK3β pathway reversed the effects of TAZ on osteogenic differentiation induced by LPLI. Taken together, for the first time, we report that LPLI promotes osteoblast differentiation via TAZ activation dependent on Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway.

Abstract: Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) contacts based on zinc oxide (ZnO) are often used in thin film silicon solar cells and ZnO has a lower contamination potential compared to Tin Oxide or Indium-Tin Oxide. However, in this paper the adverse effects of zinc contamination on solar cell performance in large area systems when using non-optimal processes are demonstrated. Controlled contamination experiments were performed; optical emission spectroscopy allowed us to study the Zn release dynamic; secondary ions mass spectroscopy measurements allowed us to determine the Zn contamination threshold level in a-Si:H solar cells of 1018at/cm3. Higher Zn concentrations lead to loss of cell performance in the initial state and increased light induced degradation compared to cells with lower contamination. Additionally, a simple approach for Zn contamination removal is presented.

A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.06% has been obtained when the ZnPc[S(CH2)2N(CH3)3I]8 was utilized as a cathode interlayer in the PSCs based on a blend of PCDTBT (poly[N-9″-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester) as an active layer. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopic (UPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle (θ) and mobility measurements demonstrated that an introduction of ZnPc[S(CH2)2N(CH3)3I]8 between active layer and cathode decreased work function of cathode, increased hole mobility and facilitated a balance of electron and hole transport in the PSCs, resulting in a simultaneous improvement of open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and fill factor.

Abstract: Oleanolic acid (OA) is a bioactive pentacyclic triterpenoid. The current work studied the effects and possible mechanisms of OA in atherosclerosis. Quails (Coturnix coturnix) were treated with high fat diet with or without OA. Atherosclerosis was assessed by examining lipid profile, antioxidant status and histology in serum and aorta. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to 200μg/mL ox-LDL for 24h, then cell viability was assessed with MTT assay; reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed with DCFDA staining. Expression levels of LOX-1, NADPH oxidase subunits, nrf2 and ho-1 were measured with real time PCR and western blotting. Furthermore, LOX-1 was silenced with lentivirus and the expression levels assessment was repeated. OA treatment improved the lipid profile and antioxidant status in quails fed with high fat diet. Histology showed decreased atherosclerosis in OA treated animals. Ox-LDL exposure decreased viability and induced ROS generation in HUVECs, and this progression was alleviated by OA pretreatment. Moreover, elevated expression of LOX-1, NADPH oxidase subunits, nrf2 and ho-1 were observed in ox-LDL exposed HUVECs. OA pretreatment prevented ox-LDL induced increase of LOX-1 and NADPH oxidase subunits expression, while further increased nrf2 and ho-1 expression. Silencing of LOX-1 abolished ox-LDL induced effects in cell viability, ROS generation and gene expression. OA could alleviate high fat diet induced atherosclerosis in quail and ox-LDL induced cytotoxicity in HUVECs; the potential mechanism involves modulation of LOX-1 activity, including inhibition of expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and increase of the expression of nrf2 and ho-1.

Abstract: Dendriform titanium dioxide nanowires (D-TiO2 NWs) with high aspect ratio and density serve as a model architecture for high-performance self-powered ultraviolet (UV) detectors. The photo-sensing performance is characterized by integrating D-TiO2 NWs into a photoelectrochemical cell. The short-circuit current density value of the D-TiO2 NWs based UV detector is 176% and 46% higher than that of the bare TiO2 NW film and TiO2 nanocrystalline film since it offers excellent ultraviolet absorption, efficient charge carrier separation and fast electron transport. The incident power conversion efficiency can reach 14.5%, which promises a high sensitivity to the UV light. Under UV irradiation, the detector made of D-TiO2 NWs exhibits a high responsivity of 0.61A/W, a high on/off ratio of 1903 (incident power density 25mWcm−2) and a fast response time of 5.9ms. Combined with visible-blind characteristics and photosensitivity linearity in wide light intense range, the D-TiO2 NWs based self-powered UV detector demonstrates promising application in various fields.

Abstract: One of the foremost challenges in achieving high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells is in devising an efficient light trapping system because of the short optical path length imposed by the inherent thin absorption layers. In this paper, an efficient light trapping system is proposed using a combination of randomly textured surfaces and a one-dimensional photonic crystal (randomly textured photonic crystal; RTPC). The influence of the texture on the optical performance of RTPCs is discussed using the results of an experiment and a finite-difference time-domain simulation. This RTPC back reflector (BR) can provide high reflectivity and strong light scattering, resulting in an increased photocurrent density of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cell. As a result, the highly textured RTPC BR yielded an efficiency of 9.6% for a-Si:H solar cell, which is much higher than the efficiency of 7.6% on flat AZO/Ag BR and 9.0% on textured AZO/Ag BR. This RTPC BR provides a new approach for creating high-efficiency, low-cost thin-film silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dynamics play a critical role in mitochondrial function and signaling. Although mitochondria play a critical role in hypoxia/ischemia, the further mechanisms between mitochondrial dynamics and ischemia are still unclear. The current study aimed to determine the role of mitofusin 2, a key regulator of mitochondrial fusion, in a hypoxic model and to explore a novel strategy for cerebral ischemia via modulation of mitochondrial dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate both mitochondrial function and molecular pathways to determine the role of mitofusin 2 in hypoxia-induced neuronal apoptosis. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice (male, 19–25g) underwent a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion for 12 or 24h (n=6 per group). In vitro, cobalt chloride was used to mimic hypoxia in immortalized hippocampal neurons. Down- or up-regulation of Mfn2 was induced to investigate the role of Mfn2 in hypoxia, especially in mitochondrial function and signaling pathways. The findings demonstrated that decreased mitofusin 2 occurred both in vivo and in vitro hypoxic models; second, the anti-apoptotic effect of Mfn2 may work via restoration of mitochondrial function; third, the modulation of the B Cell Leukemia 2/Bcl-2 Associated X protein and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways highlight the role of Mfn2 in signaling pathways beyond fusion. In summary, depletion of mitofusin 2 would lead to apoptosis both in normal or hypoxic conditions; however, mitofusin 2 overexpression could attenuate hypoxia-induced apoptosis, which represents a potential novel strategy for neuroprotection against ischemic brain damage.

Abstract: We have introduced metal nanoparticles in pn-junction solar cells to study plasmonic effect in such devices. Here, the junction was based on a layer of copper–zinc–tin–sulfide (CZTS) nanocrystals as a p-type semiconductor and another layer of copper-diffused silver indium disulfide (Cu@AgInS2) nanocrystals as an n-type material in sequence. We introduced silver nanoparticles at different locations of pn- and also of np-junctions: (i) in the p-layer, (ii) in the n-layer, (iii) in both the layers, and (iv) at the interface between the layers of p- and n-type nanocrystals. The results in both pn- and np-junctions show that the devices with metal nanoparticles in p-type layer evidenced a substantial increase in energy conversion efficiency of solar cells as compared to other devices and the control device without any silver nanoparticles. We have inferred that the presence of silver nanoparticles in the depletion layer might have narrowed down the width of the region; metal nanoparticles in the n-layer acted as electron-traps to localize them hindering electron-transport and thereby reducing the efficiency of such plasmonic solar cells. Our results have shown that while introducing metal nanoparticles in solar cells, they should be placed only in the p-layer so that transport of electrons in plasmonic solar cells remains unaffected.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a potent induction factor for epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), as the inverse process of EMT, has recently been reported to promote the induction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We have developed pyrrole–imidazole (PI) polyamide, a novel gene regulator that targets human TGF-β1, and investigated its effects on the EMT/MET process. PI polyamide targeted to TGF-β1 significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of TGF-β1 and SNAI1 as an EMT marker and increased mRNA and protein expression of E-cadherin in human epithelial cells. To enhance the induction of iPSCs by the MET process, PI polyamide targeted to TGF-β1 was applied to human fibroblasts transfected with exogenous reprogramming factors by Sendai virus vector and grown in human iPSCs. The PI polyamide significantly increased the number of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies. The expression of undifferentiated markers was also observed in these colonies. These results suggest that PI polyamide targeted to human TGF-β is a novel compound that can control the EMT/MET process of human epithelial cells and enhance the induction of human fibroblasts to iPSCs.

Abstract: Synucleins are small, soluble proteins expressed primarily in neural tissue and in certain tumors. The synuclein family consists of three members: α-, β-, and γ-synucleins present only in vertebrates. Members of the synuclein family have high sequence identity, especially in the N-terminal regions. The synuclein gene family came into the spotlight, when one of its members, α-synuclein, was found to be associated with Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, whereas γ-synuclein was linked to several forms of cancer. There are a lot of controversy and exciting debates concerning members of the synuclein family, including their normal functions, toxicity, role in pathology, transmission between cells and intracellular localization. Important findings which remain undisputable for many years are synuclein localization in synapses and their role in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking, whereas their presence and function in mitochondria and nucleus is a debated topic. In this review, we present the data on the localization of synucleins in two intracellular organelles: the nucleus and mitochondria.

Abstract: Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 molten salt mixtures are potentially suitable for high temperature thermal energy storage in the concentrating solar power. We investigated the LiNaK carbonate salt with hydroxides of lithium (LiOH), potassium (KOH), or calcium (Ca(OH)2) by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). From the repeated heating DSC curves, lower melting points with excellent reproducibility were found when 10wt% LiOH or KOH was added into 40wt%Li2CO3–20wt%Na2CO3–40wt%K2CO3. Based on the characterization of XRD patterns, the molten eutectic mixtures consisted of LiKCO3, LiNaCO3, and residual Li2CO3 when the ternary carbonate salt was heated at the temperature above the melting point and cooled rapidly. In the system of LiNaK carbonate salt with additives of LiOH or KOH, more LiKCO3 and LiNaCO3 with lower melting point can be formed by substitution reaction. Thus, optimal molar ratio for the mixed molten salts with low melting point could be quickly obtained by studying the composition of the resulting eutectic mixtures.

Abstract: Conventional silver paste for crystalline silicon solar cells exhibits low cell efficiency when deposited by non-contact electrohydrodynamic jet printing because of either high volumetric shrinkage or low packing density when there is no printing pressure applied to the silver paste. Therefore, we develop bimodally dispersed silver paste for electrohydrodynamic jet printing to resolve both volumetric shrinkage and packing density of the conventional silver paste, and its electrical and rheological traits are investigated. The bimodally dispersed silver paste exhibits lower unit-line resistance, which is inversely proportional to the weight ratio of small-to-large silver particles due to the increased packing density, and higher contact resistivity above a certain weight ratio for small-to-large silver particles. This behaviour results from the obstructed melt flow of glass frit by the early coarsened and densified small silver particles at an elevated temperature. The increased weight ratio of the small particles also raises the viscosity of the bimodally dispersed silver paste above the point where electrohydrodynamic jet printing is possible. By employing a binary solvent mixture and metallorganic silver as a viscosity reducing agent, the bimodally dispersed silver paste is tuned for electrohydrodynamic jet printing, and the front-side metallization of a polycrystalline silicon solar cell with the emitter sheet resistance of 60Ω/sq is constructed. With the abnormally high aspect ratio of silver electrodes at 0.86, a cell efficiency of 16.72% is achieved, which is higher than that of screen-printed cells with the similar emitter sheet resistance by +0.22–0.52%p.

Abstract: The optical performance of micromorph solar cells employing mixed-phase n-SiOx as advanced n-layer in the top junction has been systematically investigated with efficient state of the art ZnO front electrodes characterized by different scattering properties. The layer is applied with the dual function of n-layer and intermediate reflector. Enhanced top cell current complemented by significant dependence on the front texture has been observed. With smoother (locally flat-like) front electrode, interference effects are present with adverse impact on the spectral response of the bottom cell. Moving to rougher substrates these effects are strongly attenuated thus fully disclosing the strength of the present scheme, which is the simultaneous enhancement of both top cell current and total current. Quantitatively the gain is impacted by the front electrode morphology. Guidelines for a cross-optimization of texture and dual-function n-SiOx properties/thickness are supplied in order to take full advantage from this design.

Abstract: Multifunctional surface coatings hamper the UV/Near-infrared (NIR) radiations and resist ice/fog formation finds ready use in green buildings. Here, aluminium doped ZnO nano pigment (AZO) was synthesized and incorporated into poly(methyl methacrylate) [PMMA] polymer matrix to fabricate AZO/PMMA multilayered coatings on glass surface. Functional properties such as UV absorption, NIR shielding, self-cleaning, surface hardness and scratch resistance were assessed for AZO/PMMA coatings. Results revealed that AZO pigmented PMMA coatings shield UV and IR radiations in the wavelengths 363 and 1100nm, respectively. Al-doping helps to enhance the NIR reflectivity in ZnO pigment. Coatings retain optical transparency only upto 20 layers. Interestingly, AZO/PMMA coated glass surface shows significant surface temperature cut-off upto 8°C even with 7 layers. The coated glass found to have anti-icing property compared to uncoated surfaces when dipping in liquid N2. AZO/PMMA coatings can be an inexpensive interface/interphase layers for multifunctional glass windows.

Abstract: Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) films were grown by electrodeposition in aqueous solutions of varying pH. The effect of bath pH on morphology, structural, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of Cu2O films was investigated. XRD showed that all prepared films were polycrystalline Cu2O, without formation of competing phases such as CuO and Cu. The film grown in the solution with a pH of 8 is made up of Cu2O crystallites with preferential (200) planes exposed. The films deposited at solution pH values of 10, 12 and 14 exhibit Cu2O crystallites with preferential (111) planes exposed. As photoelectrodes these Cu2O films generate photocurrent upon light illumination. The Cu2O film grown in the solution with pH of 12 shows the best PEC performance for hydrogen generation. The (111) facets of the Cu2O film were stable without corrosion during the PEC test. A mechanism for the preferred faceting in alkaline solution has been discussed.

Abstract: Autophagy is considered as an important cell death mechanism that closely interacts with other common cell death programs like apoptosis. Critical role of autophagy in cell death makes it a promising, yet challenging therapeutic target for cancer. We identified a series of 1,2,3-triazole analogs having significant breast cancer inhibition property. Therefore, we attempted to study whether autophagy and apoptosis were involved in the process of cancer cell inhibition. The lead molecule, 1-(1-benzyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-2-(4-bromophenylamino)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol (T-12) induced significant cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis and autophagy in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. T-12 increased reactive oxygen species and its inhibition by N-acetyl-l-cysteine protected breast cancer cells from autophagy and apoptosis. Autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine abolished T-12 induced apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and reactive oxygen species generation. This suggested that T-12 induced autophagy facilitated cell death rather than cell survival. Pan-caspase inhibition did not abrogate T-12 induced autophagy, suggesting that autophagy precedes apoptosis. In addition, T-12 inhibited cell survival pathway signaling proteins, Akt, mTOR and Erk1/2. T-12 also induced significant regression of tumor with oral dose of as low as 10mg/kg bodyweight in rat mammary tumor model without any apparent toxicity. In presence of reactive oxygen species inhibitor (N-acetyl-l-cysteine) and autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine), T-12 induced tumor regression was significantly decreased. In conclusion, T-12 is a potent inducer of autophagy-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo and can serve as an important lead in development of new anti-tumor therapy.

Abstract: Proteinuria is an important risk factor for chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Several studies have suggested that proteinuria initiates tubulointerstitial inflammation, while the mechanisms have not been fully understood. In this study, we hypothesized whether the activation of the TLR2–MyD88–NF-κB pathway is involved in tubulointerstitial inflammation induced by proteinuria. We observed expression of TLR2, MyD88, NF-κB, as well as TNF-α and IL-6 detected by immunohistostaining, Western blotting and real-time PCR in albumin-overloaded (AO) nephropathy rats. In vitro, we observed these markers in HK-2 cells stimulated by albumin. We used TLR2 siRNA or the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 to observe the influence of TNF-α and IL-6 expression caused by albumin overload. Finally, we studied these markers in non-IgA mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) patients with different levels of proteinuria. It was demonstrated that expression of TLR2, MyD88 and NF-κB were significantly increased in AO rats and in non-IgA MsPGN patients with high levels of proteinuria, and TNF-α and IL-6 expressions were increased after NF-κB activation. Furthermore, TNF-α and IL-6 expression was positively correlated with the level of proteinuria. Albumin-overload induced TNF-α and IL-6 secretions by the TLR2–MyD88–NF-κB pathway activation, which could be attenuated by the TLR2 siRNA or BAY 11-7082 in HK-2 cells. In summary, we demonstrated that proteinuria may exhibit an endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that induces tubulointerstitial inflammation via the TLR2–MyD88–NF-κB pathway activation.

Abstract: Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, plays an essential role in eliminating excessive, damaged or harmful cells. Previous work has demonstrated that anticancer drugs induce cell apoptosis by inducing cytotoxicity. In recent years, several reports demonstrated modulated expression of DNA methyltransferases 1 (DNMT1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in a variety of tumors. In this study, we showed that the expression of DNMT1 was decreased and the methylation of CpGs in the promoter of AChE was reduced in anticancer drugs-induced apoptotic hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Silencing of DNMT1 expression by AZA or RNA interference (RNAi) restored AChE production and inhibition of AChE expression by RNAi protected HCC cells from anticancer drugs-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the regulation of AChE by DNMT1 was involved in the phosphorylated p38 pathway in anticancer drugs-induced apoptosis. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that P-p38, DNMT1 and AChE were aberrantly expressed in a subset of HCC tumors. Taken together, we demonstrated the regulation of AChE by DNMT1 and further, we found that this regulation was involved in the phosphorylated p38 pathway in anticancer drugs-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is increasingly implicated in multiple biological and molecular events that regulate the proliferation or invasiveness in several cancers. However, little is known about the expression and functions of PKD1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, 34 pairs of human NSCLC and matched normal bronchiolar epitheliums were enrolled and evaluated for PKD1 expression by quantitative real-time PCR. We showed that PKD1 was downregulated in 26 of 34 cancer tissues in comparison with matched normal epitheliums. Moreover, patients with venous invasion or lymph node metastasis showed significant lower expression of PKD1. Exposure of NSCLC A549 and H520 cells to the PKD family inhibitor kb NB 142-70(Kb), at concentrations that inhibited PKD1 activation, strikingly potentiated S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr389 and S6 phosphorylation at Ser235/236 in response to phorbol ester (PMA). Knockdown of PKD1 with siRNAs strikingly enhanced S6K1 phosphorylation whereas constitutively active PKD1 resulted in the S6K1 activity inhibition. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitors LY294002, BKM120 and MEK inhibitors U0126, PD0325901 blocked the enhanced S6K1 activity induced by Kb. Collectively, our results identify decreased expression of the PKD1 as a marker for NSCLC and the loss of PKD1 expression increases the malignant potential of NSCLC cells. This may be due to the function of PKD1 as a negative regulator of mTORC1-S6K1. Our results suggest that re-expression or activation of PKD1 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is implicated in atherosclerosis and restenosis. Nuclear receptor subfamily 6, group A, member 1 (NR6A1) is involved in regulating embryonic stem cell differentiation, reproduction, neuronal differentiation. Functional cooperation between cAMP response element modulator tau (CREMtau) and NR6A1 can direct gene expression in cells. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) plays a key role in VSMC migration. In this study, we sought to determine whether CREB involved in NR6A1-modulated VSMC migration. VSMCs treated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) displayed reduced mRNA and protein levels of NR6A1. Adenovirus-mediated expression of NR6A1 (Ad-NR6A1) could inhibit PDGF-BB- and serum-induced VSMC migration. The mRNA and protein expressions of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) were down-regulated by NR6A1 overexpression. SPP1 promoter reporter activity was repressed by NR6A1. NR6A1 was found to physically couple with nuclear actin and the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, we showed that CREB interacted with NR6A1 in VSMCs. NR6A1 overexpression repressed cAMP response element (CRE) activity. ChIP assay revealed that NR6A1 bind to SPP1 promoter. Luciferase reporter assay showed that NR6A1 regulated SPP1 promoter activity via a putative CRE site. Adenovirus mediated local NR6A1 gene transfer attenuated stenosis after balloon-induced arterial injury in Sprague–Dawley rats. Taken together, this study provided experimental evidence that NR6A1 modulated SPP1 expression via its binding with CREB protein in VSMCs. We also revealed a NR6A1-CREB-SPP1 axis that serves as a regulatory mechanism for atherosclerosis and restenosis.

Abstract: Although disputed by some, increasing evidence suggests that TNF-α synergies with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs to exert a heightened antitumor effect. The present study investigated the antitumor efficacy of recombinant IL-15 in combination with the STAT3 inhibitor cucurbitacin-I in a doxorubicin-resistant murine lymphoma model. The significance of the work is to understand and design effective strategies in doxorubicin resistant lymphomas. TNF-α is downregulated in dendritic cells from mice with Dalton's lymphoma and shows an inverse relationship with disease progression. Doxorubicin-resistant DL cells have elevated levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increased phosphorylation of STAT3. These cells are refractory to dendritic cell derived TNF-α. Doxorubicin resistant Dalton's lymphoma is susceptible to dendritic cell derived TNF-α upon stimulation with the STAT3 inhibitor cucurbitacin-I, which downregulates STAT3 and other survival molecules. The combined treatment of low dose of cucurbitacin-I and rIL-15 is ineffective in mice with doxorubicin resistant Dalton's lymphoma, but a similar therapy prolongs the survival of mice transplanted with parental Dalton's lymphoma. Doxorubicin resistant Dalton's lymphoma responds to therapy with high doses of cucurbitacin-I and rIL-15. Dendritic cell derived from mice responded positively to the therapy and regained their tumoricidal properties with respect to growth inhibition and killing of DL tumor cells. Similar to DL, DC derived from CML patients are impaired in TNF-α expression and are unable to restrict the growth of drug-resistant lymphoma and leukemia cells. This combination approach could be used as a new therapeutic strategy for aggressive and highly metastatic doxorubicin resistant lymphoma.

Abstract: The porous mullite/Na2SO4 composites with both novel structure and improved heat storage properties were successfully prepared by infiltration of the molten Na2SO4 into the porous mullite matrix, which was fabricated by TBA-based freezing casting method. The effects of fabrication parameters on pore structure of the porous mullite matrix, the infiltration ratio of molten Na2SO4 and heat storage properties of the composites were investigated extensively. The results show that the infiltration ratio of the molten Na2SO4 decreases with decreasing the porosity and increasing the infiltration temperature and the average pore size of the porous mullite matrix. While it increases initially with increases of the infiltration time, and tends to remain constant thereafter. The optimal infiltration temperature and infiltration time are 950°C and 1h, respectively. The unidirectionally aligned open pores in the porous mullite matrix benefit the infiltration process, and the higher infiltration ratio of the molten Na2SO4 and the relatively larger specific heat capacity of the mullite powders both contribute to the higher heat storage density of the composites.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the resistance against chemotherapy-induced cell death is still of great interest since the number of patients with cancer increases and relapse is commonly observed. Indeed, the development of hypoxic regions as well as UPR (unfolded protein response) activation is known to promote cancer cell adaptive responses to the stressful tumor microenvironment and resistance against anticancer therapies. Therefore, the impact of UPR combined to hypoxia on autophagy and apoptosis activation during taxol exposure was investigated in MDA–MB-231 and T47D breast cancer cells. The results showed that taxol rapidly induced UPR activation and that hypoxia modulated taxol-induced UPR activation differently according to the different UPR pathways (PERK, ATF6, and IRE1α). The putative involvement of these signaling pathways in autophagy or in apoptosis regulation in response to taxol exposure was investigated. However, while no link between the activation of these three ER stress sensors and autophagy or apoptosis regulation could be evidenced, results showed that ATF4 activation, which occurs independently of UPR activation, was involved in taxol-induced autophagy completion. In addition, an ATF4-dependent mechanism leading to cancer cell adaptation and resistance against taxol-induced cell death was evidenced. Finally, our results demonstrate that expression of ATF4, in association with hypoxia-induced genes, can be used as a biomarker of a poor prognosis for human breast cancer patients supporting the conclusion that ATF4 might play an important role in adaptation and resistance of breast cancer cells to chemotherapy in hypoxic tumors.

Abstract: Emitter formation is one of the most critical and crucial process steps in the fabrication of standard silicon wafer solar cells. Typically the photovoltaic industry uses tube based phosphorus diffusion, using phosphorus oxychloride as the dopant source. Alternately, a low-cost inline diffusion using phosphoric acid as a dopant source can be used. However, proper process conditions must be used to meet solar cell energy conversion efficiencies obtained by tube diffusion. In this work, we present the application of a non-acidic homogeneous emitter etch-back process – the ‘SERIS etch’ – for inline-diffused emitters in order to raise the efficiency of multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) wafer solar cells. We apply both light and heavy emitter etch-backs on inline-diffused emitters with sheet resistance (Rsq) values in the 40–60Ω/sq range to achieve emitters with a target Rsq of ~70Ω/sq. The emitter surface reflectance and doping uniformity are maintained even after an etch-back that results in a Rsq change of ~30Ω/sq. An average cell efficiency gain of 0.4% (absolute) is reported for cells with heavy etch-back when compared to the as-diffused non-etch-back screen-printed full-area aluminum back surface field solar cells and efficiencies up to 17.9% are achieved. Besides, best lot of the etch-back inline-diffused cells shows a 0.2% (absolute) efficiency gain over the standard tube-diffused cells. These results show that the ‘SERIS etch’ etch-back process can enable higher-efficiency industrial inline-diffused multi-Si wafer solar cells.

Abstract: Ag nanoparticles (NPs), as etching catalyst, are applied onto the pyramid textured surface of the semi-finished single crystalline silicon solar cell by spraying a solution containing AgNO3 and sodium citrate. Upon chemical etching, nanopits are formed with the Ag NPs staying inside of the nanopits. Complete solar cells with and without the Ag-assisted etching are fabricated to study the effects of the hybrid nanostructure. It is found that the optical reflection is effectively reduced by the nanostructure and the incident light is harvested more effectively for enhanced external quantum efficiency (EQE) by as much as 17% for the cells before the SiNx anti-reflection coating, and the EQE can be further enhanced by applying an electric bias 1V during the EQE measurement. It is believed that when the solar cell with the Ag NPs is illuminated, the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is induced at the specific wavelength regions around 405 and 810nm. For ultraviolet light, the LSPR effect dominates the increases of the EQE while the effective medium effect is also believed to be responsible for the effective light trapping.

Abstract: Electrochromic (EC) devices assembled using two complementary optically active electrodes, i.e. sputtered tungsten (VI) oxide (WO3) and sol–gel substoichiometric nickel oxide–polyaniline (NiO1−x–PANI) films, were used for the evaluation of several ormolytes during coloring/bleaching switching. Electrolytes were prepared from bis end-capped bis(ethoxysilyl)/poly(ethylene oxide) di-uretanesil precursor via solvolysis and condensation with glacial acetic acid. Different amounts of mesylate imidazolium-based ionic liquid co-solvent were added to modify the viscoelastic properties of the ormolytes. An extensive IR spectroscopic investigation was conducted to follow the formation of a gel structure of di-urethanesil precursor through decrease of etoxysilyl modes (1165, 1103, 1079 and 955cm−1), remaining silanols (910cm−1), while the presence of silylacetate mode (1724cm−1) could not be ascertained unequivocally. Formation of siloxane bridging (prevailing T2 type) was confirmed independently by using 29Si NMR spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction showed an amorphous character of the electrolytes. Rheology measurements of the electrolyte were combined with the time-dependent determination of the conductivities (of the order of magnitude 10−4S/cm), and the dependence of the phase shift angle δ fitted using a five-parameter logistic function. It was found that adequate viscoelastic properties are essential (δ>0) in obtaining a sufficiently high conductivity for application in EC devices, and their cycling was examined up to 980 voltammetric and chronocoulometric cycles. The calculation of color coordinates revealed the shift of a⁎, b⁎ to green-blue space with coloration. The coloration efficiency (101st cycle) confirmed the differences in consistency of electrolytes, i.e. 74.3cm2/C for EC device with viscoelastic liquid-like electrolyte, but decreased to 54.7cm2/C for device with gel character of electrolyte.

Abstract: The process named “multi-layer precursor method”, consisting of Ga–Se/In–Se/Cu–Se stacked precursors, is proposed to prepare Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) films on flexible stainless steel (SUS) substrates. In this work, precursor deposition temperature (TPRE), varying from about 250 to 430°C, is first scrutinized. From Raman scattering measurement, it is suggested that the increase in the TPRE enhances Cu2−xSe secondary phase during film deposition, thus enlarging CIGS grain size, while decreases ordered vacancy compound (OVC) near surface of the finished film, caused by desorption of In2Se during the precursor deposition. Suitable TPRE is in a range of approximately 370–400°C, resulting in long carrier lifetime. Next, according to the examinations of material compositions of CIGS absorbers, the optimized [Cu]/([In]+[Ga]) contributes to the absorbers with large grain size due to the help of Cu2−xSe phase during film deposition and OVC near their surfaces for pn homo-junction. The appropriate [Ga]/([In]+[Ga]) leads to optimized band-gap energy with high CIGS quality implied by long carrier lifetime. Ultimately, the effective [Cu]/([In]+[Ga]) and [Ga]/([In]+[Ga]) ratios for the flexible CIGS solar cell with high conversion efficiency under the so-called “multi-layer precursor method” are in ranges of about 0.74–0.84 and 0.28–0.35, respectively.

Abstract: A simple method is developed to determine the light trapping properties of arbitrarily textured solar cells with high accuracy. The method allows for determining the quantum efficiency and short circuit current density of thin film solar cells prepared on randomly nanotextured surfaces. The light trapping of the randomly textured solar cell is described by the area weighted superposition of periodically textured solar cells. The necessary input parameters for the calculations are determined by analyzing the randomly textured surfaces of the solar cells using atomic force microscopy and image processing. The analysis of the atomic force microscope images and the calculation of the quantum efficiency and short circuit current can be determined from current maps, without complex and time-consuming calculations. The calculated solar cell parameters exhibit excellent agreement with experimentally measured quantum efficiencies and short circuit current densities for amorphous and microcrystalline silicon thin film solar cells prepared on randomly textured substrates. Finally, the work contributes to a comparison of random and periodic light trapping structures.

Abstract: Intermediate band solar cells must demonstrate the principle of voltage preservation in order to achieve high conversion efficiencies. Tunnel escape of carriers has proved deleterious for this purpose in quantum dot intermediate band solar cells. In previous works, thick spacers between quantum dot layers were demonstrated as a means of reducing tunnel escape, but this approach is unrealistic if a large number of quantum dot layers have to be grown. In this work we report experimental proof that the use of field damping layers is equally effective at reducing tunnel carrier escape, by reducing the potential drop in the QD-stack and the associated electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the fact that tunnel carrier escape takes place under short-circuit conditions does not imply that voltage preservation cannot be achieved. We describe a theory that relates the evolution of the tunnel escape to bias voltage and the preservation of the voltage in an IBSC. Temperature and voltage-dependent quantum efficiency measurements, temperature dependent open-circuit voltage measurements and calculations of the internal electric field in IBSCs serve as the basis of the proposed theory.

Abstract: Phagocytosis, an evolutionarily conserved process in animals, plays a central role in host defense against pathogens. As reported, Rab6 GTPase was involved in the regulation of hemocytic phagocytosis in invertebrates. However, the role of Rab6 GTPase in mammalian phagocytosis remains to be addressed. In this study, the results showed that Rab6 GTPase took great effects on phagocytosis of mouse leukemic monocyte macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells). It was revealed that Rab6 GTPase was required during the phagosome maturation by its interaction with bicaudal-D1 (BICD1) protein. Further data presented that the Rab6 GTPase-regulated phagocytosis could influence the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus in macrophages. Therefore, our study demonstrated a novel insight into the mechanism of regulation of mammalian phagocytosis by Rab6 GTPase and a novel strategy for the control of Staphylococcus aureus.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death for women. The estrogen receptors (ERs) ratio is important in the maintenance of mitochondrial redox status, and higher levels of ERβ increases mitochondrial functionality, decreasing ROS production. Our aim was to determine the interaction between the ERα/ERβ ratio and the response to cytotoxic treatments such as cisplatin (CDDP), paclitaxel (PTX) and tamoxifen (TAM). Cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy, ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial functionality were analyzed in MCF-7 (high ERα/ERβ ratio) and T47D (low ERα/ERβ ratio) breast cancer cell lines. Cell viability decreased more in MCF-7 when treated with CDDP and PTX. Apoptosis was less activated after cytotoxic treatments in T47D than in MCF-7 cells. Nevertheless, autophagy was increased more in CDDP-treated MCF-7, but less in TAM-treated cells than in T47D. CDDP treatment produced a raise in mitochondrial mass in MCF-7, as well as the citochrome c oxidase (COX) and ATP synthase protein levels, however significantly reduced COX activity. In CDDP-treated cells, the overexpression of ERβ in MCF-7 caused a reduction in apoptosis, autophagy and ROS production, leading to higher cell survival; and the silencing of ERβ in T47D cells promoted the opposite effects. In TAM-treated cells, ERβ-overexpression led to less cell viability by an increment in autophagy; and the partial knockdown of ERβ in T47D triggered an increase in ROS production and apoptosis, leading to cell death. In conclusion, ERβ expression plays an important role in the response of cancer cells to cytotoxic agents, especially for cisplatin treatment.

Abstract: The electrode reactions of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBABr) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide (TBPBr) were investigated in the presence of LiBr. The cyclic voltammograms of TBABr and TBPBr exhibited a white-colored state (white film formation) and a transparent colorless state (film dissolution). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements of the white films revealed that TBA+ and TBP+ formed water-insoluble ion pairs with the tribromide generated by the electrooxidation of Br− to produce the white-colored TBABr3 and TBPBr3 films, respectively. The films were reversibly decolored electrochemically to the initial transparent state. In addition, the cyclic voltammetry with different alkylammonium salts ((CnH2n+1)4N+Br−, n=2, 4, 5, and 6) suggested that hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) was closely related to the white film formation, and that the HLB corresponding to the tetrabutylammonium made possible the formation of the stable white film with a long memory life time (recording) and the complete dissolution of the white film with a low applied potential (erasing). The morphological observation of the white films demonstrated that the white-colored appearance was attributed to the effect of light scattering by their coarse structures.

Abstract: Solar energy is the best source of renewable energy among all other natural resources. Due to the abundant availability of solar energy it could effectively be used to fulfil the energy requirement of modern industrial society. Application of nanofluids in Direct Absorption Solar Collectors (DASC) can significantly increase its efficiency. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, that exhibit high thermal conductivity, unique optical properties, good mechanical strength, and large surface area have been of great advantage in the field of nanofluids. In this present work, application of N-(rGO-MWNTs) (nitrogen doped hybrid structure of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)) in DASC has been investigated. The absorption and transmittance studies have been carried out by UV–visible–NIR spectrophotometer. Furthermore, temperature dependant thermal conductivity study with different volume fractions has been carried out. A significant enhancement in thermal conductivity of 17.7% is achieved with 0.02% volume fraction in DI water and 15.1% with 0.03% volume fraction with EG. Furthermore, we have observed that these nanofluids have very good stability without any agglomeration and sedimentation due to percolation network formed through intercalation of MWNTs in-between rGO layers.

Abstract: In this study we investigate the potential of intrinsic a-SiOx:H, with a band gap of about 2.07eV, as absorber material in thin-film silicon solar cells. We found that single junction a-SiOx:H cells with an i-layer thickness of 100–200nm can have a high Voc and FF of up to 1.04V and 0.74, respectively. However, when the i-layer thickness is increased further to obtain higher Jsc, the Voc×FF product decreases significantly and limits the conversion efficiency to around 7.2%. Although the efficiency of a single-junction device is limited, the high Voc×FF product makes this device interesting for application as the first sub-cell in multi-junction devices. To investigate this, first double-junction (2J) solar cells were fabricated with the second sub-cell of either a-Si:H (Eg≈1.7eV) or nc-Si:H (Eg≈1.1eV), reaching efficiencies of 10.25% and 10.92%, respectively. Although these are decent efficiencies, both 2J cells are limited by the a-SiOx:H first sub-cell and so far have no advantage over the conventional a-Si:H/nc-Si:H cell. Secondly, we fabricate two types of triple-junction (3J) solar cells, which consist of the above mentioned 2J solar cells with the additional nc-Si:H third sub-cell at the bottom. In both 3J solar cells current mismatching can be reduced with a relatively thin a-SiOx:H first sub-cell (≈100nm) such that its high Voc×FF product can be fully used. An initial efficiency as high as 12.58% was obtained (Voc: 2.37V, Jsc: 7.27mA/cm2 and FF: 0.73) for the a-SiOx:H/a-Si:H/nc-Si:H 3J solar cell. This efficiency is competitive with the efficiency of other types of 3J solar cells and demonstrates that a-SiOx:H opens up new routes towards high efficiency 3J thin-film silicon solar cells.

Abstract: A mixed phase metal oxide system is considered as a highly active and stable photocatalyst due to extended absorption spectrum and reduced recombination of the photogenerated carriers as a result of their efficient separation at the phase interface. In ceria such a mixed phase has two different oxidation states wherein the oxygen deficient state has a complementary characteristic of high charge carrier mobility. Further due to the direct dependence of mobility on temperature in such a system, and its synergy with reduced recombination in mixed phase and extended absorption spectrum of solar radiation, it suits a solar concentrator based photo-catalytic reactor which normally works at high temperature. Accordingly a mixed phase (biphasic) homo-composite (same material with different oxidation state) of low temperature engineered cerium oxide (CeO2/Ce2O3) nanostructures was prepared by hydrothermal method. The physico-chemical characterization of the vacuum annealed disordered nanostructure material revealed the presence of biphasic homocomposite with extended absorption spectrum and also the presence of oxygen vacancies at the junction of phases. The mixed phase Ce-oxide with Ce3+/Ce4+ introduced disorder in the surface layers of nanostructure as well. The photoactivity of CeO2 nanoparticles was evaluated using methyl orange as a probe pollutant both under UV and visible irradiation over a wide range of temperature. The photocatalytic activity and its temperature dependence were found to be high compared to monophasic Ce-oxide. This work provides a rational design and development procedure for high-performance thermo-photocatalysts.

Abstract: We report the well-controlled preparation of WS2 nanosheets–CdS nanoparticle heterojunction for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting application. The WS2 nanosheets with an average thickness of ~5nm and lateral dimensions of ~200nm were synthesized via liquid phase exfoliation of bulk WS2 in water/ethanol solution, followed by deposition onto ITO substrate via electrophoretic method. CdS nanoparticles were grown via facile successive ion layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Using these two well-controlled methods, CdS/WS2/ITO and WS2/CdS/ITO systems were fabricated. The loading of WS2 nanosheets was controlled by the deposition condition and the heterojunction was optimized for enhanced photoelectrochemical response under simulated sunlight irradiation. The fabricated electrodes were characterized by various analytical techniques as well as PEC response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Our results showed that the CdS/WS2/ITO heterojunction exhibits a stable photo-current density which is 3 times higher than the CdS/ITO electrode. In contrast, photo-current density of the WS2/CdS/ITO electrode was lower than that of the bare CdS/ITO, indicating that an appropriate energy level cascade is essential for achieving enhanced PEC response. A charge transfer mechanism was proposed to explain the observed PEC enhancement. This work indicates that the exfoliated WS2 nanosheet is a promising material for stable photoelectrochemical applications.

Abstract: Regulators of G-protein-signaling (RGS) proteins are a category of intracellular proteins that have an inhibitory effect on the intracellular signaling produced by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). RGS along with RGS-like proteins switch on through direct contact G-alpha subunits providing a variety of intracellular functions through intracellular signaling. RGS proteins have a common RGS domain that binds to G alpha. RGS proteins accelerate GTPase and thus enhance guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis through the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. As a result, they inactivate the G protein and quickly turn off GPCR signaling thus terminating the resulting downstream signals. Activity and subcellular localization of RGS proteins can be changed through covalent molecular changes to the enzyme, differential gene splicing, and processing of the protein. Other roles of RGS proteins have shown them to not be solely committed to being inhibitors but behave more as modulators and integrators of signaling. RGS proteins modulate the duration and kinetics of slow calcium oscillations and rapid phototransduction and ion signaling events. In other cases, RGS proteins integrate G proteins with signaling pathways linked to such diverse cellular responses as cell growth and differentiation, cell motility, and intracellular trafficking. Human and animal studies have revealed that RGS proteins play a vital role in physiology and can be ideal targets for diseases such as those related to addiction where receptor signaling seems continuously switched on.

Abstract: In certain metal wrap through (MWT) solar cell structures, the external rear contact – that is connected to the front grid by the via contacts – directly overlaps the silicon base with opposite polarity. Since no intermediate p–n-junction is present in-between, leakage currents under forward bias may occur. Such leakage currents directly affect the conversion efficiency of the cell. This work investigates the electrical contact properties of five screen printing via pastes to p-type and n-type Czochralski-grown silicon with different surface topographies and different intermediate dielectric insulation layer systems. Dark current–voltage (IV) measurements on test structures reveal a significant impact of the via paste on the IV characteristics. In addition, especially for n-type silicon, reverse bias load leads to significantly increased forward leakage currents. Stability tests performed with p-type MWT solar cells (either with aluminum back surface field or passivated rear surface) reveal no significant fill factor drops when appropriate via pastes are used.

Abstract: Fullerene coated ITO electrodes were prepared by a vacuum thermal evaporation system where fullerene (C60) powders were used as a deposition source. The fullerene coated electrodes act as an ion storage layer for electrochromic devices (ECDs). The ECDs are comprised of Prussian blue (PB) electrodes as the EC electrode, fullerene coated ITO electrodes as the counter electrode, and an electrolyte containing LiClO4 salt. By employing fullerene coated ITO electrodes, the lower transmittance in the colored state (Tc) was achieved because of the lower transmittance of fullerene coated ITO. It led to an increase in the change in optical density (ΔOD) according to the increase in the thickness of the fullerene films. Also, the charge density per electrode area (Qd) of the ECDs increased with the increase in the thickness of the fullerene films. This result indicates that the amounts of lithium ions and PB molecules, which are used for the EC phenomenon, were increased. As a result, EC properties such as the ΔOD and response time were enhanced by employing fullerene coated ITO electrodes because fullerene films provided the ion storage layer as the counter electrode of the PB electrode.

Abstract: In this work the performance stability of rear side passivated multicrystalline silicon solar cells and modules under carrier injection at different temperatures is investigated. Compared to most other tests the degradation procedure were extended to significantly longer time periods and include relevant module temperatures in field. Severe power degradation levels of above 10% can be detected after several hundred to thousand hours (corresponding ~5–20 years depending on the location) which cannot be explained by B–O complex formation or FeB pair dissociation. After detection of this light induced degradation at temperatures above 50°C the common abbreviation LID was renamed and state more precisely Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID). A high number of cells and modules degraded in laboratory and outdoor using material from different wafer suppliers confirm the relevance of this effect. LeTID is a multicrystalline silicon bulk phenomenon leading to a highly injection dependent lifetime characteristic after degradation and features a regeneration phase after degradation. The time constant of this degradation mechanism accelerates with increasing temperature, however, the time span for degradation and regeneration of thousands of hours at relevant temperatures between 60 and 85°C demands for a solution on wafer material or processing side. LeTID can be significantly reduced by adapting the cell process and processing sequence.

Abstract: Context and objective
By using molecular markers, it is possible to gain information on both the classification and etiopathogenesis of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasias (MPN).
Methods
In a group of 27 Mexican mestizo patients with MPNs, we studied seven molecular markers: the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, the JAK2 V617F mutation, the JAK2 exon 12 mutations, the MPL W515L mutation, the MPL W515K mutation, and the calreticulin (CALR) exon 9 deletion or insertion. Patients with the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene were excluded. We studied 14 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), eight with polycythemia vera (PV), four with primary myelofibrosis (MF), and one with undifferentiated MPN.
Results
We found twelve individuals with the JAK2 V617F mutation; five of them had been clinically classified as PV, five as ET, and one as MF. One patient with the MPL W515L was identified with a clinical picture of ET. Five patients with the CALR mutation were identified, four ET and one MF. No individuals with either the MPL W515K mutation or the JAK2 exon 12 mutations were identified. The most consistent relationship was that between PV and the JAK2 V617F mutation (p=.01).
Conclusions
Despite its small size, the study shows much less prevalence of JAK2 mutation in PV, ET and MF, which does not match international data.

Abstract: Cu2Sn1−xGexS3 thin-film absorbers are prepared by sulfurization of laminated precursors. The crystal grain size is enhanced under higher growth temperature and/or sulfur pressure. By the XRD and Raman analyses, the crystal alloy is considered to be composed of majority monoclinic phase with minority secondary phase such as Cu2(Sn1−xGex)3S7 throughout the whole Ge/(Ge+Sn) composition range. The optical band gap is observed to be varied between 0.94eV and 1.30eV in relation with the Ge contents. A photovoltaic conversion efficiency of about 2% is obtained in the sample utilizing Cu2Sn0.6Ge0.4S3 absorber.

Abstract: Protein Mrt4 is one of trans-acting factors involved in ribosome biogenesis, which in higher eukaryotic cells contains a C-terminal extension similar to the C-terminal part of ribosomal P proteins. We show that human Mrt4 (hMrt4/MRTO4) undergoes phosphorylation in vivo and that serines S229, S233, and S235, placed within its acidic C-termini, have been phosphorylated by CK2 kinase in vitro. Such modification does not alter the subcellular distribution of hMrt4 in standard conditions but affects its molecular behavior during ActD induced nucleolar stress. Thus, we propose a new regulatory element important for the stress response pathway connecting ribosome biogenesis with cellular metabolism.

Abstract: In order to reduce the effects of solar energy on the instruments and the apparatus in the outer space, two different kinds of ceramic coatings were prepared on Ti6Al4V alloys by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in zirconate electrolytes. The phase composition, microstructure, thickness, and roughness of coatings were examined by XRD, SEM, EDS, thickness measurement gauge, and roughness measuring instrument, respectively. The infrared emissivity and solar absorbance of the ceramic coatings were studied with the UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer and infrared reflectometer. The results show that ZrO2 coatings are dense and deep gray–green, and mainly composed of m-ZrO2, t-ZrO2. In addition, a small amount of TiO2, ZrTiO4, and the amorphous compound containing P exists in the coating. The intrinsic solar absorbance and emissivity of ZrO2 coatings are 0.92 and 0.76, respectively. The KZr2(PO4)3 coating is rough, thick, and white with the main crystalline of KZr2(PO4)3. The intrinsic solar absorbance and emissivity of the KZr2(PO4)3 coating are 0.62 and 0.91, respectively. For both coatings, the absorbance decreases while the emissivity increases due to an increase in the real surface area of the coatings by increasing thickness and roughness of the coatings as the PEO time progresses. The porous structure of the KZr2(PO4)3 is proved to be ideal for high emissivity and low absorbance materials with the lowest solar absorbance (0.239), the highest infrared emissivity (0.99), and a corresponding balance temperature of the coating of 276K.

Abstract: Objective/background
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are heterogeneous clonal bone marrow stem cell disorders and include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) neoplasia. In 2005, the JAK2V617F mutation was identified in Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients. The aim of this study was to sequence coding exons 12 and 14 of the JAK2 gene in Jordanian patients with MPN.
Methods
Both exons 12 and 14 of the JAK2 gene were amplified using polymerase chain reaction from DNA extracted from 68 blood and bone marrow samples belonging to 57 MPN patients and subjected to DNA sequencing.
Results
JAK2V617F mutations were detected in 26 of 57 Jordanian patients (45%) with different MPNs. JAK2V617F was identified in 70%, 31%, and 14% of PV, ET, and IMF cases, respectively. Five men diagnosed with PV were homozygous for JAK2V617F, whereas the other 21 patients were heterozygous for the mutation. Neither the JAK2V617F mutation nor any DNA polymorphism in exon 12 or exon 14 of the JAK2 gene was detected among the 40 leukemic patients. A rare single nucleotide polymorphism, c.1860C→T (rs375442615), was detected in one patient with ET.
Conclusion
This study is the first molecular investigation of the JAK2 gene in Jordan. We successfully identified the JAK2V617F mutation in Jordanian patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPNs. Our results provide a basis for the early detection of this mutation and simplify the diagnostic workup for these disorders at the molecular level.

Abstract: Heat-light soaking effects on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells with atomic layer deposition (ALD)-Zn(O,S) and chemical bath deposition (CBD)-ZnS(O,OH) buffer layers were investigated using temperature-dependent current–voltage and admittance spectroscopy measurements. Both CBD-ZnS(O,OH)/CIGS and ALD-Zn(O,S)/CIGS solar cells showed a significant increase in the cell performance after the combined heat and light soaking (HLS) post-treatment. Temperature-dependent current–voltage measurements showed a reduced roll-over of current density–voltage curve after the HLS post-treatment, suggesting a reduced recombination at the absorber/buffer interface. Admittance spectroscopy measurement revealed a remarkable shift towards shallower energy positions for the defect N1 after HLS post-treatment in both CIGS solar cells fabricated using CBD and ALD methods. By optimizing the HLS and the deposition conditions for each buffer layer, CBD-ZnS(O,OH)/CIGS and ALD-Zn(O,S)/CIGS solar cells yielded total efficiencies of 18.8 and 18.7%, respectively.

Abstract: Lafora disease (LD, OMIM254780, ORPHA501) is a rare neurodegenerative form of epilepsy related to mutations in two proteins: laforin, a dual specificity phosphatase, and malin, an E3-ubiquitin ligase. Both proteins form a functional complex, where laforin recruits specific substrates to be ubiquitinated by malin. However, little is known about the mechanism driving malin–laforin mediated ubiquitination of its substrates. In this work we present evidence indicating that the malin–laforin complex interacts physically and functionally with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2-N (UBE2N). This binding determines the topology of the chains that the complex is able to promote in the corresponding substrates (mainly K63-linked polyubiquitin chains). In addition, we demonstrate that the malin–laforin complex interacts with the selective autophagy adaptor sequestosome-1 (p62). Binding of p62 to the malin–laforin complex allows its recognition by LC3, a component of the autophagosomal membrane. In addition, p62 enhances the ubiquitinating activity of the malin–laforin E3-ubiquitin ligase complex. These data enrich our knowledge on the mechanism of action of the malin–laforin complex as an E3-ubiquitin ligase and reinforces the role of this complex in targeting substrates toward the autophagy pathway.

Abstract: The observation that prolonged inflammation plays a causative role in cancer development has been well documented. However, an incremental process that leads from healthy to malignant phenotypes has not yet been described. Experimentally induced hepatocellular carcinoma is considered one of the representative laboratory models for studying this process. Hepatic exposure to viral infection or toxic reagents leads to chronic inflammation and gradual transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we present metabolomic profiles of hepatic cells at different stages during inflammation-induced cellular transformation by N-nitrosodiethylamine. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, we quantitatively assessed the changes in cellular metabolites during the transformation process in hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. Further pathway analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites showed that carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism were greatly altered in hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, respectively. Additionally, the enhanced inflammation in cirrhosis was associated with a shift from carbohydrate metabolism to lipid and amino acid metabolism. Among the differentially expressed metabolites found in diseased mouse livers, d-glucose and d-mannitol showed the most significant changes, highlighting them as potential early-diagnostic biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma development. Taken together, these investigations into the dynamic metabolic changes that occur during the precancerous stages of hepatocellular carcinoma add to and refine understanding of how chronic inflammation ultimately leads to cancer. Furthermore, the findings set the stage for identifying metabolites that may serve as early-diagnostic indicators of these unfolding events.

Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO2) and zinc–tin oxide (ZnO–SnO2) nanostructures were successfully synthesized from vapor phase by heating well mixed various ratios of ZnO and/or SnO2 powders with carbon in the temperature range of 1000–1200°C in a loosely closed porcelain crucibles. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Various morphologies including tetrapods, nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts and nanoparticles in the size range of 150–350nm were microscopically observed. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples was tested toward the degradation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) in water. The photo-intermediate products were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The produced chloride and acetate ions during the degradation process were also monitored by ion chromatography. The results showed that ZnO was the most photoactive prepared nanostructures. The order of the photoactivity is ZnO>SnO2>ZnO–SnO2. Light-harvesting nanohybrids (LHNs) systems composed of the ZnO, SnO2 and ZnO–SnO2 nanostructures associated with the Rose Bengal as an organic dye has been employed to improve the light-harvesting performance of the cell. The open circuit–voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and conversion efficiency (η) are found to be 715mV, 17.52mA/cm2 and 6.74% for ZnO electrode, respectively. It is observed that the photoelectrochemical outputs for ZnO electrode increased by ~10% in Jsc and 30% in η compared with that obtained for SnO2 and ZnO–SnO2 electrodes, respectively. The use of branched tetrapods ZnO nanostructures improved the efficiency of DSSC significantly in presence of a low cost Rose Bengal dye compared with the commonly used N719 one. The results of DSSCs application are compatible with that obtained from photocatalysis. We believe that surface-to-volume aspect ratio, morphology and type of combination have a great effect on the photoelectrochemical properties.

Abstract: GaAsP/SiGe dual-junction solar cells have been epitaxially grown on silicon substrates which have the potential of achieving 1-sun tandem efficiencies of 40%. With the addition of light trapping this lattice-matched two-terminal structure can be current-matched and facilitates high performance from the III–V top cell while maintaining the cost advantages of silicon solar cells. The SiGe graded buffer allows for lattice matching of the top and bottom cell while providing a low dislocation interface between the silicon substrate and the device layers. This two-terminal dual-junction structure design is presented and demonstrates a 10.4% relative improvement in JSC and a 1.7% absolute improvement in efficiency over previous best devices. These initial structures have reached an efficiency of 18.9% under 1-sun. The devices suffer from high series resistance and exhibit reduced fill factors. A near term pathway to efficiencies approaching 25% is described.

Abstract: Single phased manganese-zinc oxide (MnZnO3) solid solution thin films have been deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates by aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) using a single source bimetallic complex, [Mn2Zn2(TFA)8(THF)4]n (1) (where TFA=trifluroactetato and THF=tetrahydrofuran), as precursor. The complex (1) was obtained by direct reaction of diacetatozinc(II) dihydrate, diacetatomanganese(II) and trifloroacetic acid in THF and was characterized by physico-chemical methods. The thickness of the film observed by a profilometer, is about 375nm. The phase purity and the stoichiometry of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The field emission gun-scanning electron microscopic (FEG-SEM) and atomic force microscopic (AFM) images confirmed that the film deposited at 500°C shows an agglomerated flower-like structure with high roughness and porosity. The optical measurements suggested that MnZnO3 has a direct band gap of 2.18eV. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies showed an anodic photocurrent density of 300µA/cm2 at 0V vs. Ag/AgCl/3M KCl.

Abstract: The most straightforward way to map the photo-induced short circuit current density (Jsc) in solar cells is light beam-induced current (LBIC) mapping. Recently several methods for Jsc imaging based on camera-based photoluminescence and illuminated lock-in thermography imaging were proposed. This letter reports an alternative method for Jsc imaging, which is solely based on the evaluation of dark lock-in thermography images. This method is particularly advantageous to improve the accuracy of dark lock-in thermography based local efficiency analysis of solar cells.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Er3+-doped monocrystalline BaY2F8 as an upconverter material for crystalline silicon solar cells with the aim of making use of previously not-utilized sub-bandgap photons. Monocrystalline samples with 10%, 20% and 30% Er3+ doping were grown in a Czochralski furnace and subsequently attached to an adapted planar bifacial silicon solar cell with a 33.4mA/cm2 short-circuit current density under one-sun AM1.5G standard measurement conditions. Optical characterization revealed that for the investigated illumination conditions the 30% Er3+-doped samples showed the most promising properties, with a very high peak absorption coefficient of 45.1cm−1 at 1493nm and a high external (internal) upconversion quantum yield of 9.5±0.7% (10.1±1.6%) under 4740±250Wm−2 monochromatic irradiation at 1520nm. Solar simulator measurements of the upconverter solar cell device using the BaY2F8:30% Er3+ sample showed an additional short-circuit current density due to upconversion ΔjSC,UC of 17.2±3.0mA/cm2 at an illumination with a solar concentration of 94±17suns, equivalent to a record relative enhancement of the short-circuit current of 0.55±0.14%. This value constitutes to our knowledge more than a doubling compared to the previously highest published values and more than a 35-fold increase compared to values published three years ago.

Abstract: Sn–xZn (x=9, 25, and 50wt%) alloy solders were applied in a photovoltaic (PV) ribbon. The effects of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) on series resistance and bond reliability of Sn–xZn PV modules were investigated. Cu5Zn8 and AgZn3 IMCs were found at the interfaces (solder/Cu and solder/Ag). The Zn content in the solder dominated the growth behavior of IMCs at the interface. The IMC thickness increased with increasing Zn content in the solder, and thus the bond reliability of the PV module deteriorated. After a bias was applied for a long duration, the interfacial characteristics and solder matrix were affected by the bias-induced thermal diffusion. In addition, the evolution in IMCs due to thermal diffusion during bias changed the original series resistance of the ribbon material and affected the series resistance of the PV module.

By copolymerizing this BDT block with three electron acceptors (DTTz (bis(thiophene-2-yl)-tetrazine), DPP (diketopyrrolopyrrole), DTffBT (4,7-bis(4-hexylthienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)) and one electron donor (TTT (2,5-Di(2-thienyl)thiophene)), four terthiophene side-chained benzodithiophene based copolymers were synthesized. Due to the difference in electron affinity among DTTz, DPP, DTffBT and TTT, these four polymers show different UV–vis absorption spectra and optical band gaps (1.3–2.0eV), while fortunately they all remain deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (−5.3 to 5.6eV) which is very favorable to high open-circuit voltage (Voc) polymer solar cells (PSCs). By comparing the photovoltaic properties with polymers which have same backbone but do not have the bulky 2D side group in the literatures, our polymer solar cells devices show higher Voc. Especially for PQ3 (a copolymer of benzodithiophene and diketopyrrolopyrrole), the donor photon energy loss (Eg–eVoc) is 0.51eV which is almost the lowest value achieved by the researchers. It can be concluded that: the bulky terthiophene side group helps to improve Voc of the PSCs devices. The overall performance of solar cells devices is correlated with the molecule conformation, polymer hole mobility and polymer/PCBM blend film morphology.

Abstract: TGF-β plays a significant role in regulating pancreas islet function and maintaining their mass. KLF10, a TGF-β downstream gene, belongs to a group of Krüppel-like transcription factors that bind to the promoters of target genes and produce effects that mimic TGF-β as a tumor suppressor. Using ChIP-chip screening, SEI-1 was identified as a target gene that may be regulated by KLF10. We conducted a series of assays to verify the presence of unknown regulation events between SEI-1 and KLF10. These showed that KLF10 transcriptionally activates the SEI-1 promoter and, furthermore, induces SEI-1 protein expression in pancreatic carcinoma cells. SEI-1 is one of the key factors involved in cell cycle control through the regulation of other transcription factors such as the p21Cip1 gene. Interestingly, it has been shown previously that p21Cip1 is indirectly activated by KLF10. Our results first demonstrated that KLF10 acts as a transcriptional activator on SEI-1, which can then result in increased p21Cip1 expression. Furthermore, KLF10-deficiency in mice is associated with a decrease in the pancreatic islet mass, which is similar to the effects found in SEI-1 deficient mice. The KLF10-defect was also associated with the nuclear accumulation of the p21Cip1 in islet cells. Based on our molecular and histological findings, we conclude that KLF10 plays an important role in pancreatic β-cells and this supports a functional link between KLF10 and various cell cycle regulators, most notably in the context of the pancreas.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transplantation is beneficial for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI), but the poor survival of BMSCs limits the repair effect. The oxidative stress in the AKI microenvironment is regarded as the main reason. Considering the potent anti-oxidant ability of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), HO-1 overexpression in BMSCs can be expected to improve the survival of BMSCs and correspondingly enhance the AKI repair effect. Here, BMSCs are transfected with pLV-HO-1/eGFP and pLV–eGFP by the lentivirus vector to get HO-1-BMSCs and eGFP-BMSCs, respectively. Ischemia/reperfusion-AKI kidney homogenate supernatant (KHS) is prepared for treating BMSCs, eGFP-BMSCs and HO-1-BMSCs. AKI-KHS results in a high inhibitory rate of BMSCs growth and a high proportion of TUNEL positive BMSCs, while HO-1 overexpression inverses this phenomenon and re-establishes the antioxidant and oxidant balance in HO-1-BMSCs. Phosphorylations of p53 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) in HO-1-BMSCs decrease. Lower levels of monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 1β are also observed in supernatant of HO-1-BMSCs. The in vivo study shows that HO-1 overexpression sharply decreases the apoptosis of BMSCs in the injured kidney, and correspondingly the renal function of the AKI rats improves significantly. In conclusion, BMSCs with HO-1 overexpression suggests a better survival in the I/R-AKI microenvironment and a better kidney repair effect. The anti-oxidant effect via the inactivations of the downstream p53 and p38MAPK in BMSCs and the anti-inflammation could be the mechanisms. It provides a novel approach for the cell-based AKI-therapy.

Abstract: Movement of zinc ions across cellular membranes is achieved mainly by two families of zinc transport genes encoding multi-transmembrane domain proteins. Members of the Zip family generally transport zinc into the cytosol, either from outside the cell or from the lumen of subcellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosomes or storage vacuoles. ZnT proteins move zinc in the opposite direction, resulting in efflux from the cell or uptake into organelles. Zinc homeostasis at both the cellular and systemic level is achieved by the coordinated action of numerous Zip and ZnT proteins, twenty-four in mammals and seventeen in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Previously, we have identified a zinc toxicity phenotype in the Drosophila eye, caused by targeted over expression of dZip42C.1 (dZip1) combined with knockdown of dZnT63C (dZnT1). In general, this phenotype was rescued by increased zinc efflux or decreased uptake and was exacerbated by decreased efflux or increased uptake. Now we have identified three additional zinc dyshomeostasis phenotypes caused by over expression of dZnT86D, dZnT86DeGFP and dZip71BFLAG. Genetic and dietary manipulation experiments showed that these three phenotypes all differ both from each other and from our original zinc toxicity phenotype. Based on these data and the approximate subcellular localization of each zinc transport protein, we propose that each phenotype represents a different redistribution of zinc within these cells, resulting in a Golgi zinc toxicity, a Golgi zinc deficiency and a combined Golgi/other organelle zinc toxicity respectively. We are able to group the remaining Drosophila Zip and ZnT genes into several functional categories based on their interaction with the three novel zinc dyshomeostasis phenotypes, allowing the role of each zinc transport protein to be defined in greater detail. This research highlights the differential effects that redistribution of zinc can have within a particular tissue and identifies the Golgi as being particularly sensitive to both excess and insufficient zinc.
