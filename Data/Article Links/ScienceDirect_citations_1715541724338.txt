Abstract: Conflicting data have been reported regarding the role of retinol-binding protein (RBP4) in insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we used pharmacological methods to investigate the role of RBP4. RNA oligonucleotide against RBP4 (anti-RBP4 oligo) was transfected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. RT-PCR analysis showed that RBP4 mRNA expression decreased by 55% (p<0.01) compared with control cells. Validated RNA oligo was used in an in vivo study with high fat diet (HFD) fed — mice. 14weeks of HFD feeding increased RBP4 expression (associated with elevated serum levels measured with immunoblotting and ELISA) by 56% in adipose tissue (p<0.05) and 68% in the liver (p<0.01). Adipose RBP4 levels were significantly reduced after 4weeks treatment with anti-RBP4 oligo (25mg/kg, p<0.01) and rosiglitazone (RSG, 10mg/kg, p<0.05) compared with scrambled RNA oligo (25mg/kg) treated mice. Only anti-RBP4 oligo significantly inhibited RBP4 protein (p<0.01) and mRNA expression (p<0.01) in the liver and reduced serum RBP4 levels. Anti-RBP4 oligo and RSG showed comparable effects on impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia. Anti-RBP4 oligo significantly enhanced adipose-GLUT4 expression (p<0.01) but did not increase muscle-GLUT4. Both RSG and anti-RBP4 oligo significantly reduced hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression (both p<0.05). Histological analysis revealed that anti-RBP4 oligo ameliorated hepatic steatosis and reduced lipid droplets associated with normalized liver function. Histological and pharmacological results of this study indicate that RBP4 is not only an adipocytokine, but also a hepatic cytokine leading to metabolic syndrome, NAFLD and type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: The acylated peptide ghrelin (AG) and its endogenous non-acylated isoform (UAG) protect cardiomyocytes, pancreatic β-cells, and preadipocytes from apoptosis, and induce preadipocytes differentiation into adipocytes. These events are mediated by AG and UAG binding to a still unidentified receptor, which determines the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2. AG and UAG also possess antilipolytic activity in vitro, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Thus, the objective of the current study was to characterize the molecular events involved in AG/UAG receptor signaling cascade. We treated rat primary visceral adipocytes with isoproterenol (ISO) and forskolin (FSK) to stimulate lipolysis, simultaneously incubating them with or without AG or UAG. Both peptides blocked ISO- and FSK-induced lipolysis. By direct measurement of cAMP intracellular content, we demonstrated that AG/UAG effect was associated to a reduction of ISO-induced cAMP accumulation. Moreover, the cAMP analog 8Br-cAMP abolished AG/UAG effect. As AG and UAG were ineffective against lipolysis induced by db-cAMP, another poorly hydrolyzable cAMP analog, phosphodiesterase (PDE) involvement was hypothesized. Indeed, cilostamide, a specific PDE3B inhibitor, blocked AG/UAG effect on ISO-induced lipolysis. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and AKT inhibitor 1,3-dihydro-1-(1-((4-(6-phenyl-1H-imidazo(4,5-g)quinoxalin-7-yl)phenyl)methyl)-4piperidinyl)-2H-benzimidazol-2-one trifluoroacetate also blocked AG/UAG action, suggesting a role in PDE3B activation. In particular, PI3K isoenzyme gamma (PI3Kγ) selective inhibition through the compound AS605240 prevented AG/UAG effect on ISO-stimulated lipolysis, hampering AKT phosphorylation on Ser473. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that AG/UAG attenuation of ISO-induced lipolysis involves PI3Kγ/AKT and PDE3B.

Abstract: Death associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a calmodulin (CaM)-regulated protein kinase that is a therapeutic target for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. We report here the results of studies that test the hypothesis of McNamara et al. (2009) that conformational selection in DAPK's glycine-rich region is key for catalytic activity. The hypothesis was tested by site-directed mutagenesis of glutamine-23 (Q23) in the middle of this loop. The glycine-rich loop exhibits localized differences in structure among DAPK conformations that correlate with different stages of the catalytic cycle. Changing the Q23 to a Valine (V23), found at the corresponding position in another CaM regulated protein kinase, results in a reduced catalytic efficiency. High resolution X-ray crystal structures of various conformations of the Q23V mutant DAPK and their superimposition with the corresponding conformations from wild type catalytic domain reveal localized changes in the glycine-rich region. The effect of the mutation on DAPK catalytic activity and the finding of only localized changes in the DAPK structure provide experimental evidence implicating conformational selection in this domain with activity. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 11th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: The yeast cytochrome bc1 complex, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is composed of ten distinct protein subunits. In the assembly of the bc1 complex, some ancillary proteins, such as the chaperone Bcs1p, are actively involved. The deletion of the nuclear gene encoding this chaperone caused the arrest of the bc1 assembly and the formation of a functionally inactive bc1 core structure of about 500-kDa. This immature bc1 core structure could represent, on the one hand, a true assembly intermediate or, on the other hand, a degradation product and/or an incorrect product of assembly. The experiments here reported show that the gradual expression of Bcs1p in the yeast strain lacking this protein was progressively able to rescue the bc1 core structure leading to the formation of the functional homodimeric bc1 complex. Following Bcs1p expression, the mature bc1 complex was also progressively converted into two supercomplexes with the cytochrome c oxidase complex. The capability of restoring the bc1 complex and the supercomplexes was also possessed by the mutated yeast R81C Bcsp1. Notably, in the human ortholog BCS1L, the corresponding point mutation (R45C) was instead the cause of a severe bc1 complex deficiency. Differently from the yeast R81C Bcs1p, two other mutated Bcs1p's (K192P and F401I) were unable to recover the bc1 core structure in yeast. This study identifies for the first time a productive assembly intermediate of the yeast bc1 complex and gives new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the last steps of bc1 assembly.

Abstract: Brain specific kinases 1 and 2 (BRSK1/2, also named SAD kinases) are serine–threonine kinases specifically expressed in the brain, and activated by LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of a threonine residue at their T-loop (Thr189/174 in human BRSK1/2). BRSKs are crucial for establishing neuronal polarity, and BRSK1 has also been shown to regulate neurotransmitter release presynaptically. How BRSK1 exerts this latter function is unknown, since its substrates at the synaptic terminal and the mechanisms modulating its activity remain to be described. Key regulators of neurotransmitter release, such as SNARE complex proteins, are located at membrane rafts. Therefore we initially undertook this work to check whether BRSK1 also locates at these membrane microdomains. Here we show that brain BRSK1, but not BRSK2, is palmitoylated, and provide biochemical and pharmacological evidences demonstrating that a pool of BRSK1, but not BRSK2 or LKB1, localizes at membrane lipid rafts. We also show that raft-associated BRSK1 has higher activity than BRSK1 from non-raft environment, based on a higher T-loop phosphorylation at Thr-189. Further, recombinant BRSK1 activity increased 3-fold when assayed with small multilamellar vesicles (SMV) generated with lipids extracted from synaptosomal raft fractions. A similar BRSK1-activating effect was obtained with synthetic SMV made with phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and sphingomyelin, mixed in the same molar ratio at which these three major lipids are present in rafts. Importantly, SMV also enhanced the activity of a constitutively active BRSK1 (T189E), underpinning that interaction with lipid rafts represents a new mechanism of BRSK1 activity modulation, additional to T-loop phosphorylation.

Abstract: ZBP-89 can enhance tumor cells to death stimuli. However, the molecular mechanism leading to the inhibitory effect of ZBP-89 is unknown. In this study, 4 liver cell lines were used to screen for the target of ZBP-89 on cell death pathway. The identified Bak was further analyzed for its role in ZBP-89-mediated apoptosis. The result showed that ZBP-89 significantly and time-dependently induced apoptosis. It significantly upregulated the level of pro-apoptotic Bak. ZBP-89 targeted a region between -457 and -407 of human Bak promoter to stimulate Bak expression based on the findings of Bak promoter luciferase report gene assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ZBP-89-induced Bak increase and ZBP-89-mediated apoptosis were markedly suppressed by Bak siRNA, confirming that Bak was specifically targeted by ZBP-89 to facilitate apoptosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that ZBP-89 significantly induced apoptosis of HCC cells via promoting Bak level.

Abstract: Tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) is an integrin-like cell surface protein upregulated on tumor blood vessels and a potential vascular target for cancer therapy. Here, we found that the ability of an anti-TEM8 antibody, clone SB5, to recognize the extracellular domain of TEM8 on the cell surface depends on other host-cell factors. By taking advantage of SB5's ability to distinguish different forms of cell surface TEM8, we identified alpha-smooth muscle actin and transgelin, an actin binding protein, as intracellular factors able to alter TEM8 cell surface structure. Overexpression of either of these proteins in cells converted TEM8 from an SB5-exposed to an SB5-masked form and protected cells from SB5-saporin immunotoxins. Because the predominant form of TEM8 on the cell surface is not recognized by SB5, we also developed a new monoclonal antibody, called AF334, which is able to recognize both the SB5-exposed and the SB5-masked forms of TEM8. AF334-saporin selectively killed TEM8-positive cells independent of TEM8 cell surface structure. These studies reveal that TEM8 exists in different forms at the cell surface, a structure dependent on interactions with components of the actin cytoskeleton, and should aid in the rational design of the most effective diagnostic and therapeutic anti-TEM8 monoclonal antibodies.

Abstract: PNRC (proline-rich nuclear receptor coregulatory protein) was primarily identified as a coactivator of nuclear receptors (NRs) by our laboratory, which enhances NR-mediated transcription by RNA polymerase II. Recent study has shown that PNRC also stimulates RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through interaction with the subunit RPC39 of RNA polymerase III. Here, we report that PNRC accumulates in the nucleolus and its depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) impairs pre-rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I. We identified the sequence at position 94–101 (94PKKRRKKK101) of PNRC as its nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS). Fusion of this sequence to GFP directed GFP to the nucleolus. Characterization of the NoLS revealed that the stretches of six successive basic residues are sufficient to function as a NoLS. Through co-immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that the NoLS is necessary and sufficient to mediate the association of PNRC with B23/nucleophosmin. Moreover, B23 depletion by siRNA disrupted the accumulation of PNRC in the nucleolus. Together, our study indicates that PNRC is a novel nucleolar protein that might be involved in regulation of pre-rRNA synthesis, and it localizes to the nucleolus by interaction with B23 via its NoLS. Our study also suggests that the stretches of six successive basic residues (lysine and/or arginine) could function as NoLS.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) exerts many potentially anti-atherogenic properties and is therefore attractive for prevention and therapy of coronary heart disease. Since induction of apoA-I production by small molecules has turned out as difficult, application of exogenous apoA-I is pursued as an alternative therapeutic option. To counteract fast renal filtration of apoA-I, a trimeric high-molecular weight variant of apoA-I (TripA) was produced by recombinant technology. We compared TripA and apoA-I for important properties in reverse cholesterol transport. Reconstituted high-density lipoproteins (rHDL) containing TripA or apoA-I together with palmitoyl-2-oleyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) differed slightly by size. Compared to apoA-I, TripA activated lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) with similar maximal velocity but concentration leading to half maximal velocity was slightly reduced (Km=2.1±0.3μg/mL vs. 0.59±0.06μg/mL). Both in the lipid-free form and as part of rHDL, TripA elicited cholesterol efflux from THP1-derived macrophages with similar kinetic parameters and response to liver-X-receptor activation as apoA-I. Lipid-free TripA is bound and transported by aortic endothelial cells through mechanisms which are competed by apoA-I and TripA and inhibited by knock-down of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1. Pre-formed TripA/POPC particles were bound and transported by endothelial cells through mechanisms which are competed by excess native HDL as well as reconstituted HDL containing either apoA-I or TripA and which involve ABCG1 and scavenger receptor B1 (SR-BI). In conclusion, apoA-I and TripA show similar in vitro properties which are important for reverse cholesterol transport. These findings are important for further development of TripA as an anti-atherosclerotic drug.

Abstract: The Type III TGF-β receptor, betaglycan, is a widely expressed proteoglycan co-receptor for TGF-β superfamily ligands. The full-length protein undergoes ectodomain cleavage with release of a soluble ectodomain fragment. The fate of the resulting transmembrane–cytoplasmic fragment, however, has never been explored. We demonstrate here that the transmembrane–cytoplasmic fragment is stable in transfected cells and in cell lines expressing endogenous betaglycan. Production of this fragment is inhibited by the ectodomain shedding inhibitor TAPI-2. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of the intramembrane protease γ-secretase stabilizes this fragment, suggesting that it is a substrate of γ-secretase. Expression of the transmembrane–cytoplasmic fragment as well as γ-secretase inhibitor stabilization are independent of TGF-β1 or -β2 and are unaffected by mutation of the cytoplasmic domain serines that undergo phosphorylation. γ-Secretase inhibition or the expression of a transmembrane–cytoplasmic fragment in HepG2 cells blunted TGF-β2 signaling. Our findings thus suggest that the transmembrane–cytoplasmic fragment remaining after betaglycan ectodomain cleavage is stable and a substrate of γ-secretase, which may have significant implications for the TGF-β signaling response.

Abstract: TRP proteins form ion channels which are activated following receptor stimulation. In T-cell lines, expression data of TRP proteins have been published. However, almost no data about TRP expression is available in primary human T-cells. Using RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR, we compare the expression of TRP mRNA in 1) human peripheral blood lymphocytes, which are a mix of mostly mono-nuclear blood lymphocytes but contain other leucocytes, 2) a pure human CD4+ T-helper cell population in the resting (=naïve) and activated (=effector) state, and 3) two commonly used CD4+ Jurkat T-cell lines, E6-1 and parental. To mimic physiological cell stimulation, we analyzed TRP expression in primary human cells in a quantitative way over several days following formation of an immunological synapse through stimulation with antibody-coated beads. The TRP expression profile of primary human T-cells was significantly different from Jurkat T-cells. Among the TRP mRNAs of the TRPC, TRPM, and TRPV family, we found consistent expression of TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPV1, TRPM2, and TRPM7 in primary human CD4+ T-cells of all analyzed blood donors. Among these, TRPC3 and TRPM2 were strongly up-regulated following stimulation, but with different kinetics. We found that TRPC3 modulates Ca2+-dependent proliferation of primary CD4+ T-cells indicating that TRPC3 may be involved in Ca2+ homeostasis in T-cells besides the well-established STIM and ORAI proteins which are responsible for store-operated Ca2+ entry.

Abstract: Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists slow atherogenesis, but cause hepatic steatosis and dysfunction in part by increasing expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1-c (SREBP1-c), a transcription factor that upregulates fatty acid (FA) synthesis. n−3 FAs decrease hepatic FA synthesis by down-regulating SREBP1-c. To test the hypothesis that n−3 FAs decrease hepatic steatosis in mice given LXR agonist, C57BL/6 mice received daily gavage of an LXR agonist T0901317 (LXRT) or vehicle for 4weeks with concomitant intakes chow or high-fat diets enriched in saturated fat (SAT) or n−3 fat (n−3). Mice on LXRT and SAT developed hepatomegaly with a large increase in size and number of hepatic lipid droplets; an n−3 diet reduced liver weight/body weight with decreased hepatic steatosis and triglyceride levels. Effects of n−3 diet on hepatic lipogenesis were linked to a blunting of LXRT upregulation of hepatic SREBP1-c and FA synthase mRNA. n−3 diets also normalized LXRT-mediated increases of plasma ALT and AST levels, whereas SAT diet increased these markers. Conclusion: These studies suggest that n−3 FAs when given together with LXR agonists have the potential to improve both hepatic steatosis and hepatotoxicity in humans that might receive LXR agonists to decrease risk of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: The salivary acinar cells have unique Ca2+ signaling machinery that ensures an extensive secretion. The agonist-induced secretion is governed by Ca2+ signals originated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed by a store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). During tasting and chewing food a frequency of parasympathetic stimulation increases up to ten fold, entailing cells to adapt its Ca2+ machinery to promote ER refilling and ensure sustained SOCE by yet unknown mechanism. By employing a combination of fluorescent Ca2+ imaging in the cytoplasm and inside cellular organelles (ER and mitochondria) we described the role of mitochondria in adjustment of Ca2+ signaling regime and ER refilling according to a pattern of agonist stimulation. Under the sustained stimulation, SOCE is increased proportionally to the degree of ER depletion. Cell adapts its Ca2+ handling system directing more Ca2+ into mitochondria via microdomains of high [Ca2+] providing positive feedback on SOCE while intra-mitochondrial tunneling provides adequate ER refilling. In the absence of an agonist, the bulk of ER refilling occurs through Ca2+-ATPase-mediated Ca2+ uptake within subplasmalemmal space. In conclusion, mitochondria play a key role in the maintenance of sustained SOCE and adequate ER refilling by regulating Ca2+ fluxes within the cell that may represent an intrinsic adaptation mechanism to ensure a long-lasting secretion.

Abstract: S100B is a homodimeric zinc-, copper-, and calcium-binding protein of the family of EF-hand S100 proteins. Zn2+ binding to S100B increases its affinity towards Ca2+ as well as towards target peptides and proteins. Cu2+ and Zn2+ bind presumably to the same site in S100B. We determined the structures of human Zn2+- and Ca2+-loaded S100B at pH 6.5, pH 9, and pH 10 by X-ray crystallography at 1.5, 1.4, and 1.65Å resolution, respectively. Two Zn2+ ions are coordinated tetrahedrally at the dimer interface by His and Glu residues from both subunits. The crystal structures revealed that ligand swapping occurs for one of the four ligands in the Zn2+-binding sites. Whereas at pH 9, the Zn2+ ions are coordinated by His15, His25, His 85′, and His 90′, at pH 6.5 and pH 10, His90′ is replaced by Glu89′. The results document that the Zn2+-binding sites are flexible to accommodate other metal ions such as Cu2+. Moreover, we characterized the structural changes upon Zn2+ binding, which might lead to increased affinity towards Ca2+ as well as towards target proteins. We observed that in Zn2+–Ca2+-loaded S100B the C-termini of helix IV adopt a distinct conformation. Zn2+ binding induces a repositioning of residues Phe87 and Phe88, which are involved in target protein binding. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 11th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates normal and tumor cell proliferation via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, homo- or heterodimerization and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3K/AKT cell survival pathways. In contrast, SST via activation of five different receptor subtypes inhibits cell proliferation and has been potential target in tumor treatment. To gain further insight for the effect of SSTRs on EGFR activated signaling, we determine the role of SSTR1 and SSTR1/5 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. We here demonstrate that cells transfected with SSTR1 or SSTR1/5 negatively regulates EGF mediated effects attributed to the inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, MAPKs as well as the cell survival signaling. Furthermore, SSTR effects were significantly enhanced in cells when EGFR was knock down using siRNA or treated with selective antagonist (AG1478). Most importantly, the presence of SSTR in addition to modulating signaling pathways leads to the dissociation of the constitutive and EGF induced heteromeric complex of EGFR/ErbB2. Furthermore, cells cotransfected with SSTR1/5 display pronounced effect of SST on the signaling and dissociation of the EGFR/ErbB2 heteromeric complex than the cells expressing SSTR1 alone. Taken together this study provides the first evidence that the presence of SSTR controls EGF mediated cell survival pathway via dissociation of ErbB heteromeric complex. We propose that the activation of SSTR and blockade of EGFR might serve novel therapeutic approach in inhibition of tumor proliferation.

Abstract: The biologically active factors known as adipocytokines are secreted primarily by adipose tissues and can act as modulators of angiogenesis. Visfatin, an adipocytokine that has recently been reported to have angiogenic properties, is upregulated in diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Because maintenance of an angiogenic balance is critically important in the management of these diseases, understanding the molecular mechanism by which visfatin promotes angiogenesis is very important. In this report, we describe our findings demonstrating that visfatin stimulates the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which plays important roles in angiogenesis. Visfatin induced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human endothelial cells. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin eliminated the angiogenic and proliferative effects of visfatin. The visfatin-induced increase in VEGF expression was also eliminated by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), a downstream target of mTOR. Visfatin inactivated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) by phosphorylating it at Ser-9, leading to the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Both rapamycin co-treatment and p70S6K knockdown inhibited visfatin-induced GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-9 and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Taken together, these results indicate that mTOR signaling is involved in visfatin-induced angiogenesis, and that this signaling leads to visfatin-induced VEGF expression and nuclear translocation of β-catenin.

Abstract: Cyclic AMP inhibits the expression of nitric oxide synthase (Harbrecht et al., 1995 [1]) in hepatocytes but the mechanism for this effect is incompletely understood. Cyclic AMP can activate several intracellular signaling pathways in hepatocytes including Protein Kinase A (PKA), cAMP regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (cAMP-GEFs), and calcium-mediated Protein Kinases. There is considerable overlap and cross-talk between many of these signaling pathways, however, and how these cascades regulate hepatocyte iNOS is not known. We hypothesized that Akt mediates the effect of cAMP on hepatocyte iNOS expression. Hepatocytes cultured with cytokines and dbcAMP increased Akt phosphorylation up to 2h of culture. Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10μM), farnyltranferase inhibitor FTI-276, or transfection with a dominant negative Akt. The cyclic AMP-induced suppression of cytokine-stimulated iNOS was partially reversed by LY294002 and FTI-276. LY294002 also increased NFκB nucleus translocation by Western blot analysis in nuclear extracts. Cyclic AMP increased phosphorylation of Raf1 at serine 259 which was blocked by LY294002 and associated with decreased MAPK P44/42 phosphorylation. However, inhibition of MAPK P44/42 signaling with PD98059 failed to suppress cytokine-induced hepatocyte iNOS expression and did not enhance the inhibitory effect of dbcAMP on iNOS production. A constitutively active MAPK P44/42 plasmid had no effect on cytokine-stimulated NO production. These data demonstrate that dbcAMP regulates hepatocyte iNOS expression through an Akt-mediated signaling mechanism that is independent of MAPK P44/42.

Abstract: In the previous paper, we reported that apolipoprotein (apo) A-I enhances generation of HDL-like lipoproteins in rat astrocytes to be accompanied with both increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ (PL-Cγ) and PL-Cγ translocation to cytosolic lipid–protein particles (CLPP) fraction. In this paper, we studied the interaction between apoA-I and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) to relate with PL-Cγ function for generation of HDL-like lipoproteins in the apoA-I-stimulated astrocytes. ABCA1 co-migrated with exogenous apoA-I with apparent molecular weight over 260kDa on SDS-PAGE when rat astrocytes were treated with apoA-I and then with a cross-linker, BS3. The solubilized ABCA1 of rat astrocytes was associated with the apoA-I-immobilized Affi-Gel 15. An LXR agonist, To901317, increased the cellular level of ABCA1, association of apoA-I with ABCA1 and apoA-I-mediated lipid release in rat astrocytoma GA-1/Mock cells where ABCA1 expression at baseline is very low. PL-Cγ was co-isolated by apoA-I-immobilized Affi-Gel 15 and co-immunoprecipitated by anti-ABCA1 antibody along with ABCA1 from the solubilized membrane fraction of rat astrocytes. The SiRNA of ABCA1 suppressed not only the PL-Cγ binding to ABCA1 but also the tyrosine phosphorylation of PL-Cγ. A PL-C inhibitor, U73122, prevented generation of apoA-I-mediated HDL-like lipoproteins in rat astrocytes. To901317 increased the association of PL-Cγ with ABCA1 in GA-1/Mock cells dependently on the increase of cellular level of ABCA1 without changing that of PL-Cγ. These findings suggest that the exogenous apoA-I augments the interaction between PL-Cγ and ABCA1 to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PL-Cγ for generation of HDL-like lipoproteins in astrocytes.

Abstract: Hypoxia is a common pathogenic stress, which requires adaptive activation of the Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF). In concert transcriptional HIF targets enhance oxygen availability and simultaneously reduce oxygen demand, enabling survival in a hypoxic microenvironment. Here, we describe the characterization of a new HIF-1 target gene, Rab20, which is a member of the Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins, regulating intracellular trafficking and vesicle formation. Rab20 is directly regulated by HIF-1, resulting in rapid upregulation of Rab20 mRNA as well as protein under hypoxia. Furthermore, exogenous as well as endogenous Rab20 protein colocalizes with mitochondria. Knockdown studies reveal that Rab20 is involved in hypoxia induced apoptosis. Since mitochondria play a key role in the control of cell death, we suggest that regulating mitochondrial homeostasis in hypoxia is a key function of Rab20. Furthermore, our study implicates that cellular transport pathways play a role in oxygen homeostasis. Hypoxia-induced Rab20 may influence tissue homeostasis and repair during and after hypoxic stress.

Abstract: Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) are rapidly becoming recognized as important mediators of cellular and immune signaling. They are generated either enzymatically or non-enzymatically and 100s of structures exist of which only a small fraction have been analyzed to date. Pleiotropic activities, including regulation of adhesion molecule expression, pro-coagulant activity and inhibition of Toll-like receptor signaling have been observed and some are detected in models of human and animal disease, including atherosclerosis and infection. More recently, the acute generation of specific oxidized phospholipids by cellular enzymes in immune cells was reported. Assays for analysis and quantification of OxPLs were first developed approx 15years ago, primarily for hydro(pero)xy-species. Many were based on monitoring a single precursor ion with/without LC separation, based on the PL headgroup. Others combined LC with monitoring precursor to product transitions, but were unable to provide information regarding position of oxidation on unsaturated sn-2 fatty acid due to sensitivity issues. More recently, LC/MS/MS methods for specific OxPLs have been reported that enable high sensitivity quantitation in biological samples. In this review, widely used methods for detecting and quantifying various classes of OxPL will be summarized, along with practical advice for their use. In particular, the focus will be on LC/MS/MS, which today is almost universally the method of choice. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipodomics and Imaging Mass Spectrometry.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein (apo) O is a newly discovered apolipoprotein preferentially contained within HDL; however, currently, no data are available on the (patho)physiological effects of apoO. Therefore, the present study assessed the impact of apoO overexpression on (i) plasma lipids and lipoproteins as well as on (ii) HDL functionality. Human apoO was overexpressed by means of recombinant adenovirus (AdhapoO) in human apoA-I transgenic mice, a humanized mouse model of HDL metabolism. AdhapoO substantially increased apoO in plasma and within HDL. However, plasma triglycerides, phospholipids, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol did not change. HDL size distribution, lipid composition and the apoA-I and the apoO distribution over the different HDL fractions separated by FPLC remained unaltered. Furthermore, enrichment of HDL with apoO did not impact on HDL functionality assessed in four independent ways, namely (i) stimulation of cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells, (ii) protection against LDL oxidation, (iii) anti-inflammatory activity on endothelial cells, and (iv) induction of vasodilation in isolated aortic rings ex vivo as a measure of stimulating vascular NO production. These results demonstrate that although overexpression of apoO results in a substantial enrichment of HDL particles with this novel apolipoprotein, apoO does not impact the plasma lipoprotein profile or HDL functionality.

Continuous light exposure causes cumulative stress that affects the localization oscillation dynamics of the transcription factor Msn2p,

Abstract: Light exposure is a potentially powerful stress factor during in vivo optical microscopy studies. In yeast, the general transcription factor Msn2p translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to illumination. However, previous time-lapse fluorescence microscopy studies of Msn2p have utilized a variety of discrete exposure settings, which makes it difficult to correlate stress levels and illumination parameters. We here investigate how continuous illumination with blue light, corresponding to GFP excitation wavelengths, affects the localization pattern of Msn2p-GFP in budding yeast. The localization pattern was analyzed using a novel approach that combines wavelet decomposition and change point analysis. It was found that the Msn2p nucleocytoplasmic localization trajectories for individual cells exhibit up to three distinct and successive states; i) Msn2p localizes to the cytoplasm; ii) Msn2p rapidly shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus; iii) Msn2p localizes to the nucleus. Many cells pass through all states consecutively at high light intensities, while at lower light intensities most cells only reach states i) or ii). This behaviour strongly indicates that continuous light exposure gradually increases the stress level over time, presumably through continuous accumulation of toxic photoproducts, thereby forcing the cell through a bistable region corresponding to nucleocytoplasmic oscillations. We also show that the localization patterns are dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) activity, i.e. yeast cells with constantly low PKA activity showed a stronger stress response. In particular, the nucleocytoplasmic oscillation frequency was found to be significantly higher for cells with low PKA activity for all light intensities.

Abstract: The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in innate immunity for the detection of highly conserved, pathogen-expressed molecules. Previously, we demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4 ligand)-increased macrophage motility required the participation of Src and FAK, which was inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-dependent. To investigate whether this iNOS/Src/FAK pathway is a general mechanism for macrophages to mobilize in response to engagement of TLRs other than TLR4, peptidoglycan (PGN, TLR2 ligand), polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (polyI:C, TLR3 ligand) and CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG, TLR9 ligand) were used to treat macrophages in this study. Like LPS stimulation, simultaneous increase of cell motility and Src (but not Fgr, Hck, and Lyn) was detected in RAW264.7, peritoneal macrophages, and bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to PGN, polyI:C and CpG. Attenuation of Src suppressed PGN-, polyI:C-, and CpG-elicited movement and the level of FAK Pi-Tyr861, which could be reversed by the reintroduction of siRNA-resistant Src. Besides, knockdown of FAK reduced the mobility of macrophages stimulated with anyone of these TLR ligands. Remarkably, PGN-, polyI:C-, and CpG-induced Src expression, FAK Pi-Tyr861, and cell mobility were inhibited in macrophages devoid of iNOS, indicating the importance of iNOS. These findings corroborate that iNOS/Src/FAK axis occupies a central role in macrophage locomotion in response to engagement of TLRs.

Abstract: Strong evidences support the inhibitory activity of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) in the apoptotic signalling by death receptors in tumor cells. However, little is known about the role of FLIP in the regulation of apoptosis in non-transformed cells. In this report, we demonstrate that FLIPL plays an important role as a survival protein in non-transformed breast epithelial cells. Silencing of FLIPL by siRNA methodology enhances TRAIL-R2 expression and activates a caspase-dependent cell death process in breast epithelial cells. This cell death requires the expression of TRAIL, TRAIL-R2, FADD and procaspase-8 proteins. A mitochondria-operated apoptotic pathway is partially required for FLIPL siRNA-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, FLIPL silencing markedly abrogates formation of acinus-like structures in a three-dimensional basement membrane culture model (3D) of the human mammary MCF-10A cell line through a caspase-8 dependent process. Furthermore, over-expression of FLIPL in MCF-10A cells delayed lumen formation in 3D cultures. Our results highlight the central role of FLIP in maintaining breast epithelial cell viability and suggest that the mechanisms regulating FLIP levels should be finely controlled to prevent unwanted cell demise.

Abstract: It is well-known that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and analogs exert anti-proliferative and pro-differentiating effects and these compounds have therefore been proposed to be of potential use as anti-cancer agents. Due to its effects on aromatase gene expression and enzyme activity, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has been proposed as an interesting substance in breast cancer treatment and prevention. In the present study, we have examined the effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on estrogen and androgen metabolism in adrenocortical NCI-H295R cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells and prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The NCI-H295R cell line has been proposed as a screening tool to study endocrine disruptors. We therefore studied whether this cell line reacted to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment in the same way as cells from important endocrine target tissues. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 exerted cell line-specific effects on estrogen and androgen metabolism. In breast cancer MCF-7 cells, aromatase gene expression and estradiol production were decreased, while production of androgens was markedly increased. In NCI-H295R cells, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulated aromatase expression and decreased dihydrotestosterone production. In prostate cancer LNCaP cells, aromatase expression increased after the same treatment, as did production of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In summary, our data show that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 exerts tissue-specific effects on estrogen and androgen production and metabolism. This is important knowledge about 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as an interesting substance for further research in the field of breast cancer prevention and treatment. Furthermore, the observed cell line-specific effects are of importance in the discussion about NCI-H295R cells as a model for effects on estrogen and androgen metabolism.

Abstract: The LDL receptor (LDLR) is an endocytic receptor that plays a major role in the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins from the circulation. During the endocytic process, the LDLR first binds lipoprotein at the cell surface and then traffics to endosomes, where the receptor releases bound lipoprotein. Release is acid-dependent and correlates with the formation of an intramolecular contact within the receptor. Human mutations at residues that form the contact are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and the goal of the present study was to determine the role of contact residues on LDLR function. We show that mutations at nine contact residues reduce the ability of the LDLR to support lipoprotein uptake. Unexpectedly, only four of the mutations (W515A, W541A, H562Y and H586Y) impaired acid-dependent lipoprotein release. The remaining mutations decreased the lipoprotein-binding capacity of the LDLR through either reduction in the number of surface receptors (H190Y, K560W, H562Y and K582W) or reduction in the fraction of surface receptors that were competent to bind lipoprotein (W144A and W193A). We also examined three residues, distal to the contact, which were predicted to be necessary for the LDLR to adopt the acidic conformation. Of the three mutations we tested (G293S, F362A and G375S), one mutation (F362A) reduced lipoprotein uptake. Together, these data suggest that the intramolecular interface plays multiple roles in LDLR function.

Abstract: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been considered for use in the prevention and treatment of cancer malignancy. FR122047 (FR) is known to have an anti-inflammatory effect, but the anticancer activity of the chemical has not yet been identified. In the present study, we could find that treatment of breast cancer MCF-7 cells with FR led to apoptosis accompanying with apparent activation of caspases. Treatment of caspase-specific inhibitors revealed that FR-induced apoptosis was caspase-8-dependent and inhibition of caspase-9 activity resulted in unexpected, marked enhancement of cell death. Knockdown of caspase-9 expression by specific siRNA caused increased susceptibility to FR-induced cell death, consistent with the results obtained with treatment of caspase-9 inhibitor. Inhibition of caspase-9 blocked the autophagic process by modulating lysosomal pH and acid-dependent cathepsin activities and augmented cell death due to blockage of cytoprotective autophagy. MCF-7 cells treated with sulforaphane, an autophagy-inducing drug, also showed marked accumulation of LC3-II, and co-treatment with caspase-9 inhibitor brought about increased susceptibility to sulforaphane-induced cell death. Different from the cases with FR or sulforaphane, etoposide- or doxorubicin-induced cell death was suppressed with co-treatment of caspase-9 inhibitor, and the drugs failed to induce significant autophagy in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, our data originally suggest that inhibition of caspase-9 may block the autophagic flux and enhance cell death due to blockage of cytoprotective autophagy.

Abstract: Adaptations in the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle cells can occur under several physiological or pathological conditions. We investigated the effect of increasing extracellular glucose concentration on the expression of markers of energy metabolism in primary skeletal muscle cells and the C2C12 muscle cell line. Growth of myotubes in 25mM glucose (high glucose, HG) compared with 5.55mM led to increases in the expression and activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a marker of glycolytic energy metabolism, while oxidative markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and citrate synthase decreased. HG induced metabolic adaptations as are seen during a slow-to-fast fiber transformation. Furthermore, HG increased fast myosin heavy chain (MHC) IId/x but did not change slow MHCI/β expression. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was shown to mediate the effects of HG on GAPDH and MHCIId/x. Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), a glucose-dependent transcription factor downstream of PP2A, partially mediated the effects of glucose on metabolic markers. The glucose-induced increase in PP2A activity was associated with an increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, which presumably mediates the increase in MHCIId/x promoter activity. Liver X receptor, another possible mediator of glucose effects, induced only an incomplete metabolic shift, mainly increasing the expression of the glycolytic marker. Taken together, HG induces a partial slow-to-fast transformation comprising metabolic enzymes together with an increased expression of MHCIId/x. This work demonstrates a functional role for ChREBP in determining the metabolic type of muscle fibers and highlights the importance of glucose as a signaling molecule in muscle.

Abstract: Stratum corneum ceramides play an essential role in the barrier properties of skin. However, their structure–activity relationships are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of acyl chain length in the non-hydroxy acyl sphingosine type (NS) ceramides on the skin permeability and their thermotropic phase behavior. Neither the long- to medium-chain ceramides (8–24C) nor free sphingosine produced any changes of the skin barrier function. In contrast, the short-chain ceramides decreased skin electrical impedance and increased skin permeability for two marker drugs, theophylline and indomethacin, with maxima in the 4–6C acyl ceramides. The thermotropic phase behavior of pure ceramides and model stratum corneum lipid membranes composed of ceramide/lignoceric acid/cholesterol/cholesterol sulfate was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy. Differences in thermotropic phase behavior of these lipids were found: those ceramides that had the greatest impact on the skin barrier properties displayed the lowest phase transitions and formed the least dense model stratum corneum lipid membranes at 32°C. In conclusion, the long hydrophobic chains in the NS-type ceramides are essential for maintaining the skin barrier function. However, this ability is not shared by their short-chain counterparts despite their having the same polar head structure and hydrogen bonding ability.

Abstract: Gankyrin is a small ankyrin-repeat protein that previous research has confirmed to be overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although relevant literature has reported on gankyrin functions in cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis, the exact role of gankyrin is poorly understood in animal model systems. This study analyzed hepatic lipid accumulation in gankyrin transgenic (GK) zebrafish. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells were predominantly increased in the liver bud of GK larvae, indicating that gankyrin functionally promoted cell proliferation at the larval stage in GK fish. However, over 90% of the viable GK adults showed an increased lipid content, leading in turn to liver steatosis. Liver histology and oil red O staining also indicated the accumulation of fatty droplets in GK fish, consistent with the specific pathological features of severe steatosis. Molecular analysis revealed that gankyrin overexpression induced hepatic steatosis and modulated the expression profiles of four hepatic microRNAs, miR-16, miR-27b, miR-122, and miR-126, and 22 genes involved in lipid metabolism. Moreover, significantly increased hepatic cell apoptosis resulted in liver damage in GK adults, leading to liver failure and death after approximately 10months. This study is the first to report gankyrin as a potential link between microRNAs and liver steatosis in zebrafish.

Abstract: Cholesteryl glucoside (CG), a membrane glycolipid, regulates heat shock response. CG is rapidly induced by heat shock before the activation of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and production of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and the addition of CG in turn induces HSF1 activation and HSP70 production in human fibroblasts; thus, a reasonable correlation is that CG functions as a crucial lipid mediator in stress responses in the animal. In this study, we focused on a CG-synthesizing enzyme, animal sterol glucosyltransferase, which has not yet been identified. In this study, we describe a novel type of animal sterol glucosyltransferase in hog stomach and human fibroblasts (TIG-3) detected by a sensitive assay with a fluorescence-labeled substrate. The cationic requirement, inhibitor resistance, and substrate specificity of animal sterol glucosyltransferase were studied. Interestingly, animal sterol glucosyltransferase did not use uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) as an immediate glucose donor, as has been shown in plants and fungi. Among the glycolipids tested in vitro, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) was the most effective substrate for CG formation in animal tissues and cultured cells. Using chemically synthesized [U-13C]Glc-β-Cer as a glucose donor, we confirmed by mass spectrometry that [U-13C]CG was synthesized in hog stomach homogenate. These results suggest that animal sterol glucosyltransferase transfers glucose moiety from GlcCer to cholesterol. Additionally, using GM-95, a mutant B16 melanoma cell line that does not express ceramide glucosyltransferase, we showed that GlcCer is an essential substrate for animal sterol glucosyltransferase in the cell.

Abstract: In the brain, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized by the CDP-choline pathway in which the rate-limiting step is catalyzed by two isoforms of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT): CTα and CTβ2. In mice, CTβ2 mRNA is more highly expressed in the brain than in other tissues, and several observations suggest that CTβ2 plays an important role in the nervous system. We, therefore, investigated the importance of CTβ2 for PC synthesis as well as for axon formation, growth and branching of primary sympathetic neurons. We show that in cultured primary neurons nerve growth factor increases the amount of CTβ2, but not CTα, mRNA and protein. The brains of mice lacking CTβ2 had normal PC content despite having 35% lower CT activity than wild-type brains. CTβ2 mRNA and protein are abundant in distal axons of mouse sympathetic neurons whereas CTα mRNA and protein were not detected. Moreover, CTβ2 deficiency in distal axons reduced the incorporation of [3H]choline into PC by 95% whereas PC synthesis in cell bodies/proximal axons was unaltered. These data suggest that CTβ2 is the major CT isoform involved in PC synthesis in axons. Axons of CTβ2-deficient sympathetic neurons contained 32% fewer branch points than did wild-type neurons although the number of axons/neuron and the rate of axon extension were the same as in wild-type neurons. We conclude that in distal axons of primary sympathetic neurons CTβ2 is a major contributor to PC synthesis and promotes axon branching, whereas CTα appears to be the major CT isoform involved in PC synthesis in cell bodies/proximal axons.

Abstract: We report a method for the simultaneous identification and quantification of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), monomethyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (MMPE), dimethyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) species in lipid extracts. The method employs a specific “mass-tag” strategy where DMPE, MMPE, and PE species are chemically methylated with deuterated methyliodide (CD3I) to produce PC molecules having class-specific mass offsets of 3, 6 and 9Da, respectively. The derivatized aminoglycerophospholipids release characteristic phosphorylcholine-like fragment ions having specific mass offsets that powers sensitive and quantitative analysis by multiple precursor ion scanning on a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Using the mass-tag strategy, we could for the first time determine the stoichiometric relationship between the biosynthetic intermediates MMPE and DMPE, and abundant PE and PC species in a single mass spectrometric analysis. We demonstrated the efficacy of the methodology by conducting a series of biochemical experiments using stable isotope labeled ethanolamine to survey the activities and substrate specificities of enzymes involved in PE metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Finally, we benchmarked the mass-tag strategy by specific and sensitive profiling of intermediate MMPE and DMPE species in liver.

Abstract: Several studies suggest that low levels of hepatic phosphatidylcholine (PC) play a role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is the key regulatory enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis. Liver-specific elimination of CTα (LCTα−/−) in mice fed a chow diet decreases very-low-density lipoprotein secretion, reduces lipid efflux from liver, and causes mild steatosis. We fed LCTα−/− mice a high fat diet to determine if impaired PC biosynthesis played a role in development of NASH. LCTα−/− mice developed NASH within one week of high fat feeding. Hepatic CTα deficiency caused hepatic steatosis, a 2-fold increase in ceramide mass, and a 20% reduction in PC content. In an attempt to prevent NASH, LCTα−/− mice were either injected daily with CDP-choline or fed the high fat diet supplemented with betaine. In addition, LCTα−/− mice were injected with adenoviruses expressing CTα. CDP-choline injections and adenoviral expression of CTα increased hepatic PC, while dietary betaine supplementation normalized hepatic triacylglycerol but did not alter hepatic PC mass in LCTα−/− mice. Interestingly, none of the treatments normalized hepatic ceramide mass or fully prevented the development of NASH in LCTα−/− mice. These results show that normalizing the amount of hepatic PC is not sufficient to prevent NASH in LCTα−/− mice.

Abstract: SULT4A1 is a cytosolic sulfotransferase that shares little homology with other human sulfotransferases but is highly conserved between species. It is found in neurons located in several regions of the brain. Recently, the stability of SULT4A1 was shown to be regulated by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Since Pin1 binds preferentially to phosphoproteins, these findings suggested that SULT4A1 is post-translationally modified. In this study, we show that the Thr11 residue of SULT4A1, which is involved in Pin1 binding is phosphorylated. MEK inhibition was shown to abolish Pin1 mediated degradation of SULT4A1 while in vitro phosphorylation assays using alanine substitution mutants of SULT4A1 demonstrated phosphorylation of Thr11 by ERK1. We also show that dephosphorylation was catalyzed by the protein phosphatase 2A. The PP2A regulatory subunit, Bβ was identified from a yeast-2-hybrid screen of human brain cDNA as a SULT4A1 interacting protein. This was further confirmed by GST pull-downs and immunoprecipitation. Other members of the B subunit (αδγ) did not interact with SULT4A1. Taken together, these studies indicate that SULT4A1 stability is regulated by post-translational modification that involves the ERK pathway and PP2A. The phosphorylation of SULT4A1 allows interaction with Pin1, which then promotes degradation of the sulfotransferase.

Abstract: Potato aspartic proteases (StAPs) and their swaposin domain (StAsp-PSI) are proteins with cytotoxic activity which involves plasma membrane destabilization. The ability of these proteins to produce cell death varies with the cellular type. Therefore, StAPs and StAsp-PSI selective cytotoxicity could be attributed to the different membrane lipid compositions of target cells. In this work we investigate the possible mechanism by which StAPs and StAsp-PSI produce selective membrane destabilization. Results obtained from leakage assays show that StAsp-PSI is a potent inducer of the leakage of LUVs containing anionic phospholipids, especially those containing phosphatidylglycerol. Based in these results, we suggest that the cytotoxic activity of StAsp-PSI on pathogenic microorganisms could be mediated by the attraction between the exposed positive domains of StAsp-PSI and the negatively charged microorganism membrane. On the other hand, our circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements and analysis by size exclusion chromatography and followed by electrophoresis, indicate that hydrophobic environment is necessary to StAsp-PSI oligomerization and both StAsp-PSI disulfide bounds and membrane with negative charged phospholipids are required by StAsp-PSI to produce membrane destabilization and then induce cell death in tumors and microorganism cell targets. Additionally, we demonstrate that the presence of cholesterol into the LUV membranes strongly diminishes the capacity of StAsp-PSI to produce leakage. This result suggests that the lack of hemolytic and cytotoxic activities on human lymphocytes of StAsp-PSI/StAPs may be partly due by the presence of cholesterol in these cell membrane types.

Abstract: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as in other eukaryotes non-polar lipids are a reservoir of energy and building blocks for membrane lipid synthesis. The yeast non-polar lipids, triacylglycerols (TG) and steryl esters (SE) are stored in so-called lipid particles/droplets (LP) as biologically inert form of fatty acids and sterols. To understand LP structure and function in more detail we investigated the molecular equipment of this compartment making use of mass spectrometric analysis of lipids (TG, SE, phospholipids) and proteins. We addressed the question whether or not lipid and protein composition of LP influence each other and performed analyses of LP from cells grown on two different carbon sources, glucose and oleate. Growth of cells on oleate caused dramatic cellular changes including accumulation of TG at the expense of SE, enhanced the amount of glycerophospholipids and strongly increased the degree of unsaturation in all lipid classes. Most interestingly, oleate as a carbon source led to adaptation of the LP proteome resulting in the appearance of several novel LP proteins. Localization of these new LP proteins was confirmed by cell fractionation. Proteomes of LP variants from cells grown on glucose or oleate, respectively, were compared and are discussed with emphasis on the different groups of proteins detected through this analysis. In summary, we demonstrate flexibility of the yeast LP lipidome and proteome and the ability of LP to adapt to environmental changes.

Abstract: In the past few years, a considerable effort was invested in interfacing mass spectrometry (MS) to microfluidics-based systems for electrospray ionization (ESI). Since its first introduction in biological mass spectrometry, chip-based ESI demonstrated a high potential to discover novel structures of biomarker value. Therefore, recently, microfluidics for electrospray in conjunction with advanced MS instruments able to perform multistage fragmentation were introduced also in glycolipid research. This review is focused on the strategies, which allowed a successful application of chip technology for ganglioside mapping and sequencing by ESI MS and tandem MS (MS/MS). The first part of the review is dedicated to the progress of MS methods in brain ganglioside research, which culminated with the introduction of two types of microfluidic devices: the NanoMate robot and a polymer microchip for electrospray. In the second part a systematic description of most relevant results obtained by using MS in combination with the two chip systems is presented. Chip-based ESI accomplishments for determination of ganglioside expression and structure in normal brain regions and brain pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases and primary brain tumors are described together with some considerations upon the perspectives of microfluidics-MS to be routinely introduced in biomedical investigation.

Abstract: Previous global transcriptome and interactome analyses of copper-treated HepG2 cells identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) as a potential master regulator of copper-responsive transcription. Copper exposure caused a decrease in the expression of HNF4α at both mRNA and protein levels, which was accompanied by a decrease in the level of HNF4α binding to its consensus DNA binding sequence. qRT-PCR and RNAi studies demonstrated that changes in HNF4α expression ultimately affected the expressions of its down-stream target genes. Analysis of upstream regulators of HNF4α expression, including p53 and ATF3, showed that copper caused an increase in the steady-state levels of these proteins. These results support a model for copper-responsive transcription in which the metal affects ATF3 expression and stabilizes p53 resulting in the down-regulation of HNF4α expression. In addition, copper may directly affect p53 protein levels. The suppression of HNF4α activity may contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological and toxicological consequences of copper toxicity in hepatic-derived cells.

Abstract: Polyprenoids, polymers containing varied numbers of isoprene subunits, serve numerous roles in biology. In Eukarya, dolichyl phosphate, a phosphorylated polyprenol bearing a saturated α-end isoprene subunit, serves as the glycan carrier during N-glycosylation, namely that post-translational modification whereby glycans are covalently linked to select asparagine residues of a target protein. As in Eukarya, N-glycosylation in Archaea also relies on phosphorylated dolichol. In this report, LC-ESI/MS/MS was employed to identify a novel dolichyl phosphate (DolP) in the thermoacidophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. The unusually short S. acidocaldarius DolP presents a degree of saturation not previously reported. S. acidocaldarius DolP contains not only the saturated α- and ω-end isoprene subunits observed in other archaeal DolPs, but also up to five saturated intra-chain isoprene subunits. The corresponding dolichol and hexose-charged DolP species were also detected. The results of the present study offer valuable information on the biogenesis and potential properties of this unique DolP. Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanism of α-isoprene unit reduction in S. acidocaldarius dolichol may facilitate the identification of the alternative, as yet unknown polyprenol reductase in Eukarya.

Abstract: Intrahepatic cholestasis eventually leads to liver failure. We report here a condition that decreases liver damage in intrahepatic cholestasis based on a mouse model that lacks multiple drug resistant protein 2 (ABCB4). We found that lack of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) decreased liver damage in Abcb4−/− mice caused by exposure of the liver to excess bile acids. The protective effect was not related to hepatic ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine or the level of cholesterol. The decreased concentration of bile acids in liver was related to impaired re-absorption of bile acids in intestine and increased disposal of bile acids in feces in Abcb4−/−/Pemt−/− mice as compared to Abcb4−/− mice. PEMT deficiency affected intestinal Na+ absorption resulting in an impaired Na+ concentration gradient along the length of the small intestine and abnormal absorption of bile acids mediated by apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). The findings of this study suggest that inhibition of PEMT and/or reduction of intestinal sodium concentration may be helpful in attenuating liver damage and prolonging hepatic function in intrahepatic cholestasis.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia significantly stimulates pancreatic islet endothelial cell apoptosis; however, the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, treating pancreatic islet endothelial (MS-1) cells with high glucose (30mmol/l) but not mannitol significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells as compared with a physiological glucose concentration (5.5mmol/l). Hyperglycemia significantly stimulated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and production of NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO−), relevant to MS-1 cell apoptosis. Moreover, induced reactive nitrogen species (RNS) significantly increased the expression of bax, cleaved caspase-3 and poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) via JNK activation, but the expression of bcl-2 was not altered. Furthermore, SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK) and 1400W (a specific inhibitor of iNOS) significantly attenuated cell apoptosis induced by high glucose. Therefore, hyperglycemia triggers MS-1 cell apoptosis by activating an intrinsic-dependent apoptotic pathway via RNS-mediated JNK activation.

Abstract: ChREBP is an essential transcription factor for lipogenesis. Its physiological role in adipose tissue has been studied only to a small extent and the control of its expression remains unknown in human adipocytes. We have studied ChREBP mRNA and protein expression levels in the liver and the omental (OM) and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissues from obese and lean subjects, as well as in human differentiated preadipocytes. Liver and OM and SC adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from lean and obese patients. Human preadipocytes were isolated from the adipose tissues from obese patients and differentiated under adipogenic conditions. ChREBP expression levels were quantified by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. We found opposing results in terms of ChREBP regulation in the liver and adipose samples. ChREBP increased in the liver from obese compared to lean subjects, whereas the expression decreased in both adipose tissues. The mRNAs of other adipogenic markers were checked in these tissues. The pattern of FASN was similar to the one for ChREBP, ADCY3 decreased in both adipose tissues from obese patients, AP2 decreased only in OM adipose tissue of obese patients and ATGL did not change. The levels of ChREBP mRNA and protein showed dramatic increases during the differentiation of human OM and SC preadipocytes. In conclusion, ChREBP expression has an opposite regulation in the liver and adipose tissue from obese subjects which is compatible with the increased hepatic lipogenesis and decreased adipocytic lipogenesis found in these patients. The dramatic increase of ChREBP mRNA and protein levels during preadipocyte differentiation suggests a role in adipogenesis.

CAIX is overexpressed in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, but is most frequently absent in corresponding normal tissues. CAIX expression is strongly induced by hypoxia and is significantly associated with tumor grade and poor survival. Herein, we show that hypoxia induces a significant increase in CAIX protein in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Using a unique mass spectrophotometric assay, we demonstrate that CAIX activity in plasma membranes isolated from MDA-MB-231 is correlated with CAIX content. We also show that CAIX exists predominantly as a dimeric, high-mannose N-linked glycoprotein. While there is some evidence that the dimeric form resides specifically in lipid rafts, our data do not support this hypothesis. EGF, alone, did not affect the distribution of CAIX into lipid rafts. However, acute EGF treatment in the context of hypoxia increased the amount of CAIX in lipid rafts by about 5-fold. EGF did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of CAIX, although EGFR and down-stream signaling pathways were activated by EGF. Interestingly, hypoxia activated Akt independent of EGF action. Together, these data demonstrate that the active form of CAIX in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line is dimeric but that neither lipid raft localization nor phosphorylation are likely required for its dimerization or activity.

Abstract: Imbalance in the supply and utilization of fatty acids (FA) is thought to contribute to intrahepatic lipid (IHL) accumulation in obesity. The aim of this study was to determine the time course of changes in the liver capacity to oxidize and store FA in response to high-fat diet (HFD). Adult male Wistar rats were fed either normal chow or HFD for 2.5weeks (short-term) and 25weeks (long-term). Short-term HFD feeding led to a 10% higher palmitoyl-l-carnitine-driven ADP-stimulated (state 3) oxygen consumption rate in isolated liver mitochondria indicating up-regulation of β-oxidation. This adaptation was insufficient to cope with the dietary FA overload, as indicated by accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines, depletion of free carnitine and increase in FA content in the liver, reflecting IHL accumulation. The latter was confirmed by in vivo1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Oil Red O staining. Long-term HFD feeding caused further up-regulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation (24% higher oxygen consumption rate in state 3 with palmitoyl-l-carnitine as substrate) and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as indicated by 62% higher mitochondrial DNA copy number compared to controls. These adaptations were paralleled by a partial restoration of free carnitine levels and a decrease in long-chain acylcarnitine content. Nevertheless, there was a further increase in IHL content, accompanied by accumulation of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation products. In conclusion, partially effective adaption of hepatic FA metabolism to long-term HFD feeding came at a price of increased oxidative stress, caused by a combination of higher FA oxidation capacity and oversupply of FA.

Abstract: Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) facilitates the transfer of phospholipids among lipoproteins. Over half of the PLTP in human plasma has been found to have little phospholipid transfer activity (inactive PLTP). We recently observed that plasma PLTP specific activity is inversely correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level and particle size in healthy adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors that contribute to the variation in plasma PLTP specific activity. Analysis of the specific activity of PLTP complexes in nine plasma samples from healthy adults revealed two clusters of inactive PLTP complexes with mean molecular weights (MW) of 342kDa and 146kDa. The large and small inactive PLTP complexes represented 52±8% (range 39–63%) and 8±8% (range 1–28%) of the plasma PLTP, respectively. Active PLTP complexes had a mean MW of 207kDa and constituted 40±6% (range 33–50%) of the plasma PLTP. The specific activity of active PLTP varied from 16 to 32μmol/μg/h. These data demonstrate for the first time the existence of small inactive plasma PLTP complexes. Variation in the amount of the two clusters of inactive PLTP complexes and the specific activity of the active PLTP contribute to the variation in plasma PLTP specific activity.

Abstract: Etoposide is a widely used anticancer drug in the treatment of different tumors. Etoposide is known to activate a wide range of intracellular signals, which may in turn induce cellular responses other than apoptosis. ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 belong to a family of transmembrane extracellular metalloproteinases involved in paracrine/juxtacrine regulation of many signaling pathways. The aim of this work was to evaluate if etoposide induces upregulation of ADAM10 or TACE/ADAM17 in two cell lines (GC-1 and GC-2) derived from male germ cells. Results showed that etoposide induced apoptosis in a dose–response manner in both GC-1 and GC-2 cells. Apoptosis started to increase 6h after etoposide addition in GC-2 cells, whereas the same was observed 18h after addition to the GC-1 cells. Protein and mRNA levels of ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 increased 18h after etoposide was removed from the GC-1 cells. In GC-2 cells, the protein levels of both proteins increased 12h after etoposide was removed. ADAM10 mRNA increased after 3h and then steadily decreased up to 12h after removal, whereas TACE/ADAM17 mRNA decreased after etoposide removal. Finally, apoptosis was prevented in GC-1 and GC-2 cells by the addition of pharmacological inhibitors of ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 to the culture medium of etoposide-treated cells. Our results show for the first time that etoposide upregulates ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 mRNA and protein levels. In addition, we also show that ADAM10 and TACE/ADAM17 have a role in etoposide-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Pancreatic β-cells have a deficit of scavenging enzymes such as catalase (Cat) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and therefore are susceptible to oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our previous work showed that, in the absence of cytosolic GPx in insulinoma RINm5F cells, an intrinsic activity of 12 lipoxygenase (12(S)-LOX) converts 12S-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HpETE) to the bioactive epoxide hepoxilin A3 (HXA3). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of HXA3 on apoptosis as compared to its precursor 12(S)-HpETE and shed light upon the underlying pathways. In contrast to 12(S)-HpETE, which induced apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway, we found HXA3 not only to prevent it but also to promote cell proliferation. In particular, HXA3 suppressed the pro-apoptotic BAX and upregulated the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Moreover, HXA3 induced the anti-apoptotic 12(S)-LOX by recruiting heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), another anti-apoptotic protein. Finally, a co-chaperone protein of HSP90, protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), was upregulated by HXA3, which counteracted oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by dephosphorylating and thus inactivating apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Taken together, these findings suggest that HXA3 protects insulinoma cells from oxidative stress and, via multiple signaling pathways, prevents them from undergoing apoptosis.

Abstract: The homeobox transcription factor PROX1 is essential for the development and maintenance of lymphatic vasculature. How PROX1 regulates lymphatic endothelial cell fate remains undefined. PROX1 has been shown to upregulate the expression of Cyclin E, which mediates the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that PROX1 activates the mouse Cyclin E1 (Ccne1) promoter via two proximal E2F-binding sites. We have determined that the N-terminal region of PROX1 is sufficient to activate a 1-kb Ccne1 promoter, whereas the homeodomain is dispensable for activation. We have identified that the Prospero domain 1 (PD1) is required for the nuclear localization of PROX1. Our comparison of two DNA-binding-deficient constructs of PROX1 showed a cell-type-specific difference between these two proteins in both their localization and function. We demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of PROX1 in lymphatic endothelial cells decreases progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. We conclude that PROX1 activates the Ccne1 promoter independent of DNA binding, and our results illustrate a novel role for PROX1 in the regulation of lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation.

Metabolic link between phosphatidylethanolamine and triacylglycerol metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,

Abstract: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae triacylglycerols (TAG) are synthesized by the acyl-CoA dependent acyltransferases Dga1p, Are1p, Are2p and the acyl-CoA independent phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) Lro1p which uses phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as a preferred acyl donor. In the present study we investigated a possible link between TAG and PE metabolism by analyzing the contribution of the four different PE biosynthetic pathways to TAG formation, namely de novo PE synthesis via Psd1p and Psd2p, the CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) pathway and lyso-PE acylation by Ale1p. In cells grown on the non-fermentable carbon source lactate supplemented with 5mM ethanolamine (Etn) the CDP-Etn pathway contributed most to the cellular TAG level, whereas mutations in the other pathways displayed only minor effects. In cki1∆dpl1∆eki1∆ mutants bearing defects in the CDP-Etn pathway both the cellular and the microsomal levels of PE were markedly decreased, whereas in other mutants of PE biosynthetic routes depletion of this aminoglycerophospholipid was less pronounced in microsomes. This observation is important because Lro1p similar to the enzymes of the CDP-Etn pathway is a component of the ER. We conclude from these results that in cki1∆dpl1∆eki1∆ insufficient supply of PE to the PDAT Lro1p was a major reason for the strongly reduced TAG level. Moreover, we found that Lro1p activity was markedly decreased in cki1∆dpl1∆eki1∆, although transcription of LRO1 was not affected. Our findings imply that (i) TAG and PE syntheses in the yeast are tightly linked; and (ii) TAG formation by the PDAT Lro1p strongly depends on PE synthesis through the CDP-Etn pathway. Moreover, it is very likely that local availability of PE in microsomes is crucial for TAG synthesis through the Lro1p reaction.

Phosphorylation of dynamin II at serine-764 is associated with cytokinesis,

Abstract: Calcineurin is a phosphatase that is activated at the last known stage of mitosis, abscission. Among its many substrates, it dephosphorylates dynamin II during cytokinesis at the midbody of dividing cells. However, dynamin II has several cellular roles including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, centrosome cohesion and cytokinesis. It is not known whether dynamin II phosphorylation plays a role in any of these functions nor have the phosphosites involved in cytokinesis been directly identified. We now report that dynamin II from rat lung is phosphorylated to a low stoichiometry on a single major site, Ser-764, in the proline-rich domain. Phosphorylation on Ser-764 also occurred in asynchronously growing HeLa cells and was greatly increased upon mitotic entry. Tryptic phospho-peptides isolated by TiO2 chromatography revealed only a single phosphosite in mitotic cells. Mitotic phosphorylation was abolished by roscovitine, suggesting the mitotic kinase is cyclin-dependent kinase 1. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylated full length dynamin II and Glutathione-S-Transferase-tagged–dynamin II–proline-rich domain in vitro, and mutation of Ser-764 to alanine reduced proline-rich domain phosphorylation by 80%, supporting that there is only a single major phosphosite. Ser-764 phosphorylation did not affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis or bulk endocytosis using penetratin-based phospho-deficient or phospho-mimetic peptides or following siRNA depletion/rescue experiments. Phospho-dynamin II was enriched at the mitotic centrosome, but this targeting was unaffected by the phospho-deficient or phospho-mimetic peptides. In contrast, the phospho-mimetic peptide displaced endogenous dynamin II, but not calcineurin, from the midbody and induced cytokinesis failure. Therefore, phosphorylation of dynamin II primarily occurs on a single site that regulates cytokinesis downstream of calcineurin, rather than regulating endocytosis or centrosome function.

Abstract: The identification of novel anti-apoptotic sequences has lead to new insights into the mechanisms involved in regulating different forms of programmed cell death. For example, the anti-apoptotic function of free radical scavenging proteins supports the pro-apoptotic function of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Using yeast as a model of eukaryotic mitochondrial apoptosis, we show that a cDNA corresponding to the mitochondrial variant of the human DUT gene (DUT-M) encoding the deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase) enzyme can prevent apoptosis in yeast in response to internal (Bax expression) and to exogenous (H2O2 and cadmium) stresses. Of interest, cell death was not prevented under culture conditions modeling chronological aging, suggesting that DUT-M only protects dividing cells. The anti-apoptotic function of DUT-M was confirmed by demonstrating that an increase in dUTPase protein levels is sufficient to confer increased resistance to H2O2 in cultured C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts. Given that the function of dUTPase is to decrease the levels of dUTP, our results strongly support an emerging role for dUTP as a pro-apoptotic second messenger in the same vein as ROS and ceramide.

Influence of cellular arachidonic acid levels on phospholipid remodeling and CoA-independent transacylase activity in human monocytes and U937 cells,

Abstract: The availability of free arachidonic acid (AA) constitutes a limiting step in the synthesis of biologically active eicosanoids. Free AA levels in cells are regulated by a deacylation/reacylation cycle of membrane phospholipids, the so-called Lands cycle, as well as by further remodeling reactions catalyzed by CoA-independent transacylase. In this work, we have comparatively investigated the process of AA incorporation into and remodeling between the various phospholipid classes of human monocytes and monocyte-like U937 cells. AA incorporation into phospholipids was similar in both cell types, but a marked difference in the rate of remodeling was appreciated. U937 cells remodeled AA at a much faster rate than human monocytes. This difference was found not to be related to the differentiation state of the U937 cells, but rather to the low levels of esterified arachidonate found in U937 cells compared to human monocytes. Incubating the U937 cells in AA-rich media increased the cellular content of this fatty acid and led to a substantial decrease of the rate of phospholipid AA remodeling, which was due to reduced CoA-independent transacylase activity. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence that cellular AA levels determine the amount of CoA-independent transacylase activity expressed by cells and provide support to the notion that CoA-IT is a major regulator of AA metabolism in human monocytes.

Abstract: Spore-forming Bacillus species capable of synthesising carotenoid pigments have recently been isolated. To date the detailed characterisation of these carotenoids and their formation has not been described. In the present article biochemical analysis on the carotenoids responsible for the yellow/orange pigmentation present in Bacilli has been carried out and the identity of the carotenoids present was elucidated. Chromatographic, UV/Vis and Mass Spectral (MS) data have revealed the exclusive presence of a C30 carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in Bacillus species. Apophytoene was detected representing the first genuine carotenoid formed by this pathway. Cultivation in the presence of diphenylamine (DPA), a known inhibitor of pathway desaturation resulted in the accumulation of apophytoene along with other intermediates of desaturation (e.g. apophytofluene and apo-ζ-carotene). The most abundant carotenoids present in the Bacillus species were oxygenated derivatives of apolycopene, which have either undergone glycosylation and/or esterification. The presence of fatty acid moieties (C9 to C15) attached to the sugar residue via an ester linkage was revealed by saponification and MS/MS analysis. In source fragmentation showed the presence of a hexose sugar associated with apolycopene derivatives. The most abundant apocarotenoids determined were glycosyl-apolycopene and glycosyl-4′-methyl-apolycopenoate esters. Analysis of these carotenoids over the developmental formation of spores revealed that 5-glycosyl-4′-methyl-apolycopenoate was related to sporulation. Potential biosynthetic pathways for the formation of these apocarotenoids in vegetative cells and spores have been reconstructed from intermediates and end-products were elucidated.

Abstract: Corynespora cassiicola has a unique but unexplored ability amongst fungi, in that it can hydroxylate 17α-hydroxyprogesterone at the highly hindered C-8 position of the steroid nucleus. In order to gain greater understanding of the mechanistic basis and capability of the 8β-hydroxylase we have transformed a range of structurally diverse androgens and progestogens with this organism. This has revealed that both steroid types can be hydroxylated at the 8β-position. The collective data has demonstrated the first time that 8β-hydroxylation occurs through inverted binding within a 9α-hydroxylase of the fungus. In the case of the progestogens, for this to occur, the presence of 17α-oxygen functionality (alcohol or epoxide) was essential. Remarkably monohydroxylation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone at carbons 8β and 15β has strongly indicated that the responsible hydroxylase has 2 different binding sites for the ring-A ketone. Unusually, with one exception, all hydroxylation occurred at axial protons and in the case of the progestogens, all above the plane of the ring system. In general all maximally oxidised metabolites contained four oxygen atoms. The importance of these findings in relation to 8β-hydroxylation of these steroids is discussed.

Abstract: Sebaceous glands secrete sebum onto the skin surface in a holocrine manner and as such a thin lipid layer is formed as a physiological barrier. In the present study, extracellular level of triacylglycerols (TG), a major sebum component, as well as intracellular TG accumulation was augmented in insulin-differentiated hamster sebocytes (DHS). The DHS exhibited phosphatidylserine exposure in an apoptosis-independent manner. In addition, intracellular ATP level and membrane-transporter activity using a substrate, Rhodamine 123, were highly detectable in the DHS rather than in the undifferentiated hamster sebocytes. A membrane-transporter activating reagent, 2′(3′)-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP), enhanced transporter activity, extracellular TG level, and phosphatidylserine exposure in the DHS. Both transporter activity and TG secretion were suppressed by R-verapamil, a potent membrane-transporter inhibitor, in the BzATP-treated and untreated DHS. Furthermore, the gene expression and production of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) were augmented in the DHS. ABCB1 was also detectable in sebaceous glands in the skin of hamsters. Moreover, the cell-differentiation- and BzATP-augmented transporter activity and TG secretion were dose-dependently inhibited by adding not only an ABCB1 antibody but also a selective inhibitor of ABCB1, PSC833. Thus, these results provide novel evidence that ABCB1 is involved in sebum secretion in the DHS, which is associated with non-apoptotic phosphatidylserine exposure and the increased level of intracellular ATP. These findings should accelerate the understanding of sebum secretion occurring in a holocrine-independent manner in sebaceous glands, and may contribute to the development of therapies for sebaceous gland disorders such as acne, seborrhea, and xerosis.

Abstract: Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIIa (PI4KIIIα) is one of four mammalian PI 4-kinases that catalyzes the first committed step in polyphosphoinositide synthesis. PI4KIIIα has been linked to regulation of ER exit sites and to the synthesis of plasma membrane phosphoinositides and recent studies have also revealed its importance in replication of the Hepatitis C virus in liver. Two isoforms of the mammalian PI4KIIIα have been described and annotated in GenBank: a larger, ~230kDa (isoform 2) and a shorter splice variant containing only the ~97kDa C-terminus that includes the catalytic domain (isoform 1). However, Northern analysis of human tissues and cancer cells showed only a single transcript of ~7.5kb with the exception of the proerythroleukemia line K562, which contained significantly higher level of the 7.5kb transcript along with smaller ones of 2.4, 3.5 and 4.2kb size. Bioinformatic analysis also confirmed the high copy number of PI4KIIIα transcript in K562 cells along with several genes located in the same region in Chr22, including two pseudogenes that cover most exons coding for isoform 1, consistent with chromosome amplification. A panel of polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides within the C-terminal half of PI4KIIIα failed to detect the shorter isoform 1 either in COS-7 cells or K562 cells. Moreover, expression of a cDNA encoding isoform 1 yielded a protein of ~97kDa that showed no catalytic activity and failed to rescue hepatitis C virus replication. These data draw attention to PI4KIIIα as one of the genes found in Chr22q11, a region affected by chromosomal instability, but do not substantiate the existence of a functionally relevant short form of PI4KIIIα.

Abstract: The serine/threonine kinase HIPK2 regulates gene expression programs controlling differentiation and cell death. HIPK2 localizes in subnuclear speckles, but the structural components allowing this localization are not understood. A point mutation analysis allowed mapping two nuclear localization signals and a SUMO interaction motif (SIM) that also occurs in HIPK1 and HIPK3. The SIM binds all three major isoforms of SUMO (SUMO-1–3), while only SUMO-1 is capable of covalent conjugation to HIPK2. Deletion or mutation of the SIM prevented SUMO binding and precluded localization of HIPK2 in nuclear speckles, thus causing localization of HIPK2 to the entire cell. Functional inactivation of the SIM prohibited recruitment of HIPK2 to PML nuclear bodies and disrupted colocalization with other proteins such as the polycomb protein Pc2 in nuclear speckles. Interaction of HIPK2 with Pc2 or PML in intact cells was largely dependent on a functional SIM in HIPK2, highlighting the relevance of SUMO/SIM interactions as a molecular glue that serves to enhance protein/protein interaction networks. HIPK2 mutants with an inactive SIM showed changed activities, thus revealing that non-covalent binding of SUMO to the kinase is important for the regulation of its function.

Abstract: Cytoskeletal remodeling is responsible for cell plasticity and facilitates differentiation, motility and adherence related functions. C3G (RAPGEF1), an exchange factor for Ras family of small GTPases, regulates cytoskeletal reorganization to induce filopodia in epithelial cells and neurite growth in neuroblastoma cells. Here we show that C3G overexpression induces neurite-like extensions (NLE) in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 breast carcinoma cells and not in a variety of other cancer cell lines examined. These processes were actin-rich with nodes, branches and microspikes. C3G associates with the cytoskeleton and its expression enabled stabilization of microtubules. NLE formation was dependent on Rap, Rac and Cdc42. C3G expression was associated with a decrease in cellular β-catenin levels specifically in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. β-Catenin stabilization induced by GSK-3β inhibition, or coexpression of β-catenin, reduced C3G induced NLE formation. Time lapse analysis showed reduced motility of C3G expressing cells compared to GFP expressing cells. Our results suggest that C3G overexpression can induce phenotypic characteristics of neuronal cells in highly invasive breast cancer cells and inhibit their motility.

Abstract: STIM1 is a transmembrane protein essential for the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), a major Ca2+ influx mechanism. STIM1 is either located in the endoplasmic reticulum, communicating the Ca2+ concentration in the stores to plasma membrane channels or in the plasma membrane, where it might sense the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Plasma membrane-located STIM1 has been reported to mediate the SOCE sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ through its interaction with Orai1. Here we show that plasma membrane lipid raft domains are essential for the regulation of SOCE by extracellular Ca2+. Treatment of platelets with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) induced Mn2+ entry, which was inhibited by increasing concentrations of extracellular Ca2+. Platelet treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which removes cholesterol and disrupts the lipid raft domains, impaired the inactivation of Ca2+ entry induced by extracellular Ca2+. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin also abolished translocation of STIM1 to the plasma membrane stimulated by treatment with TG and prevented TG-evoked co-immunoprecipitation between plasma membrane-located STIM1 and the Ca2+ permeable channel Orai1. These findings suggest that lipid raft domains are essential for the inactivation of SOCE by extracellular Ca2+ mediated by the interaction between plasma membrane-located STIM1 and Orai1.

Abstract: Weibel–Palade bodies (WPBs) are secretory organelles of endothelial cells that store the thrombogenic glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF). Endothelial activation, e.g. by histamine and thrombin, triggers the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of WPB that releases vWF into the vasculature and thereby initiates platelet capture and thrombus formation. Towards understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulated WPB exocytosis, we here identify components of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) machinery associated with WPB. We show that vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 3 and VAMP8 are present on WPB and that VAMP3, but not VAMP8 forms a stable complex with syntaxin 4 and SNAP23, two plasma membrane-associated SNAREs in endothelial cells. By introducing mutant SNARE proteins into permeabilized endothelial cells we also show that soluble VAMP3 but not VAMP8 mutants comprising the cytoplasmic domain interfere with efficient vWF secretion. This indicates that endothelial cells specifically select VAMP 3 over VAMP8 to cooperate with syntaxin 4 and SNAP23 in the Ca2+-triggered fusion of WPB with the plasma membrane. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 11th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Ceramidases (CDase) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of N-acyl linkage of ceramide (Cer) to generate sphingosine and free fatty acids. In this study we report the purification and characterization of a novel second type of neutral ceramidase from rat brain (RBCDase II). Triton X-100 protein extract from rat brain membrane was purified sequentially using Q-Sepharose, HiLoad16/60 Superdex 200pg, heparin-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose HP, and Mono Q columns. After Mono Q, the specific activity of the enzyme increased by ~15,000-fold over that of the rat brain homogenate. This enzyme has pH optima of 7.5, and it has a larger apparent molecular weight (110kDa) than the previously purified (90kDa) and characterized neutral rat brain CDase (RBCDase I). De-glycosylation experiments show that the differences in molecular mass of RBCDase I and II on SDS-PAGE are not due to the heterogeneity with N-glycan. RBCDase II is partially stimulated by Ca2+ and is inhibited by pyrimidine mono nucleotides such as TMP and UMP. This finding is significant as it demonstrates for the first time an effect by nucleotides on a CDase activity. The enzyme was also inhibited by both oxidized and reduced GSH. The effects of metal ions were examined, and we found that the enzyme is very sensitive to Hg2+ and Fe3+, while it is not affected by Mn2+. EDTA was somewhat inhibitory at a 20mM concentration.

HSP90 modulates actin dynamics: Inhibition of HSP90 leads to decreased cell motility and impairs invasion,

Abstract: HSP90, a major molecular chaperone, plays an essential role in the maintenance of several signaling molecules. Inhibition of HSP90 by inhibitors such as 17-allylamino-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17AAG) is known to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells by decreasing the activation or expression of pro-survival molecules such as protein kinase B (Akt). While we did not observe either decrease in expression or activation of pro-survival signaling molecules in human breast cancer cells upon inhibiting HSP90 with 17AAG, we did observe a decrease in cell motility of transformed cells, and cell motility and invasion of cancer cells. We found a significant decrease in the number of filopodia and lamellipodia, and in the F-actin bundles upon HSP90 inhibition. Our results show no change in the active forms or total levels of FAK and Pax, or in the activation of Rac-1 and Cdc-42; however increased levels of HSP90, HSP90α and HSP70 were observed upon HSP90 inhibition. Co-immuno-precipitation of HSP90 reveals interaction of HSP90 with G-actin, which increases upon HSP90 inhibition. FRET results show a significant decrease in interaction between actin monomers, leading to decreased actin polymerization upon HSP90 inhibition. We observed a decrease in the invasion of human breast cancer cells in the matrigel assay upon HSP90 inhibition. Over-expression of αB-crystallin, known to be involved in actin dynamics, did not abrogate the effect of HSP90 inhibition. Our work provides the molecular mechanism by which HSP90 inhibition delays cell migration and should be useful in developing cancer treatment strategies with known anti-cancer drugs such as cisplatin in combination with HSP90 inhibitors.

Abstract: 12/15-Lipoxygenases (12/15-LOXs) have been implicated in inflammatory and hyperproliferative diseases but the structural biology of these enzymes is not well developed. Most LOXs constitute single polypeptide chain proteins that fold into a two-domain structure. In the crystal structure the two domains are tightly associated, but small angle X-ray scattering data and dynamic fluorescence studies suggested a high degree of structural flexibility involving movement of the N-terminal domain relative to catalytic subunit. When we inspected the interdomain interface we have found a limited number of side-chain contacts which are involved in interactions of these two structural subunits. One of such contact points involves tyrosine 98 of N-terminal domain. This aromatic amino acid is invariant in vertebrate LOXs regardless of overall sequence identity. To explore in more detail the role of aromatic interactions in interdomain association we have mutated Y98 to various residues and quantified the structural and functional consequences of these alterations. We have found that loss of an aromatic moiety at position 98 impaired the catalytic activity and membrane binding capacity of the mutant enzymes. Although CD and fluorescence emission spectra of wild-type and mutant enzyme species were indistinguishable, the mutation led to enlargement of the molecular shape of the enzyme as detected by analytic gel filtration and this structural alteration was shown to be associated with a loss of protein thermal stability. The possible role of tight interdomain association for the enzyme's structural performance is discussed.

Abstract: Trafficking kinesin proteins (TRAKs) 1 and 2 are kinesin-associated proteins proposed to function in excitable tissues as adaptors in anterograde trafficking of cargoes including mitochondria. They are known to associate with N-acetylglucosamine transferase and the mitochondrial rho GTPase, Miro. We used confocal imaging, Förster resonance energy transfer and immunoprecipitations to investigate association between TRAKs1/2, N-acetylglucosamine transferase, the prototypic kinesin-1, KIF5C, and Miro. We demonstrate that in COS-7 cells, N-acetylglucosamine transferase, KIF5C and TRAKs1/2 co-distribute. Förster resonance energy transfer was observed between N-acetylglucosamine transferase and TRAKs1/2. Despite co-distributing with KIF5C and immunoprecipitations demonstrating a TRAK1/2, N-acetylglucosamine transferase and KIF5C ternary complex, no Förster resonance energy transfer was detected between N-acetylglucosamine transferase and KIF5C. KIF5C, N-acetylglucosamine transferase, TRAKs1/2 and Miro formed a quaternary complex. The presence of N-acteylglucosamine transferase partially prevented redistribution of mitochondria induced by trafficking proteins 1/2 and KIF5C. TRAK2 was a substrate for N-acetylglucosamine transferase with TRAK2 (S562) identified as a site of O-N-acetylglucosamine modification. These findings substantiate trafficking kinesin proteins as scaffolds for the formation of a multi-component complex involved in anterograde trafficking of mitochondria. They further suggest that O-glycosylation may regulate complex formation.

Abstract: The ATP-binding cassette transporter-2 (ABCA2) has been identified as a possible regulator of lipid metabolism. ABCA2 is most highly expressed in the brain but its effects on cholesterol homeostasis in neuronal-type cells have not been characterized. It is important to study the role of ABCA2 in regulating cholesterol homeostasis in neuronal-type cells because ABCA2 has been identified as a possible genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the effects of ABCA2 expression on cholesterol homeostasis were examined in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells. ABCA2 reduced total, free- and esterified cholesterol levels as well as membrane cholesterol but did not perturb cholesterol distribution in organelle or lipid raft compartments. ABCA2 did not modulate de novo cholesterol biosynthesis from acetate. Cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane was not affected by ABCA2 but efflux to the physiological acceptor ApoE3 and mobilization of plasma membrane cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum for esterification were reduced by ABCA2. ABCA2 reduced esterification of serum and low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol but not 25-hydroxycholesterol. ABCA2 decreased low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mRNA and protein levels and increased its turnover rate. The surface expression of LDLR as well as the uptake of fluroresecent DiI-LDL was also reduced by ABCA2. Reduction of endogenous ABCA2 expression by RNAi treatment of N2a cells and rat primary cortical neurons produced the opposite effects of over-expression of ABCA2, increasing LDLR protein levels. This report identifies ABCA2 as a key regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and LDLR metabolism in neuronal cells.

Abstract: Chk1 plays a key role in the DNA replication checkpoint and in preserving genomic integrity. Previous studies have shown that reduced Chk1 function leads to defects in the checkpoint response and is closely associated with tumorigenesis. Here, we report that glucose deprivation caused the degradation of Chk1 protein without perturbing cell cycle progression. The induction of Chk1 degradation in response to glucose deprivation was observed in various cancer cell lines and in normal human fibroblasts. Therefore, it appears to be a universal phenomenon in mammalian cells. A specific proteasome inhibitor blocked glucose deprivation-induced Chk1 degradation. Ubiquitination of Chk1 was detected, indicating that the proteasome–ubiquitin pathway mediates Chk1 degradation upon glucose deprivation. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 at the Ser317 and Ser345 sites is not required, suggesting that the molecular mechanism for Chk1 degradation upon glucose deprivation is distinct from genotoxic stress-induced degradation. Under conditions of glucose deprivation, the cells manifested a defective checkpoint response to replication stress, camptothecin or hydroxyurea. The forced expression of Myc-Chk1 partially rescued the defective response to the replication block upon glucose deprivation. Taken together, our results indicate that glucose deprivation induces ubiquitin-mediated Chk1 degradation and defective checkpoint responses, implying its potential role in genomic instability and tumor development.

Abstract: Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to analyze lipid extracts especially for the identification of new lipid metabolites. A hurdle to lipid identification is the presence of solvent contaminants that hinder the identification of low abundance species or covalently modify abundant lipid species. We have identified several non-enzymatically derived minor lipid species in lipid extracts of Escherichia coli; phosphatidylmethanol, ethyl and methyl carbamates of PE and N-succinyl PE were identified in lipid extracts of E. coli. Phosphatidylmethanol (PM) was identified by exact mass measurement and collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Extraction in the presence of deuterated methanol leads to a 3 atomic mass unit shift in the [M–H]− ions of PM indicating its formation during extraction. Ethyl and methyl carbamates of PE, also identified by exact mass measurement and MS/MS, are likely to be formed by phosgene, a breakdown product of chloroform. Addition of phosgene to extractions containing synthetic PE significantly increases the levels of PE-MC detected in the lipid extracts by ESI-MS. Extraction in the presence of methylene chloride significantly reduced the levels of these lipid species. N-succinyl PE is formed from reaction of succinyl-CoA with PE during extraction. Interestingly N-succinyl PE can be formed in an aqueous reaction mixture in the absence of added E. coli proteins. This work highlights the reactivity of the amine of PE and emphasizes that careful extraction controls are required to ensure that new minor lipid species identified using mass spectrometry are indeed endogenous lipid metabolites.

Abstract: N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine is a precursor phospholipid for anandamide, oleoylethanolamide, and other N-acylethanolamines, and it may in itself have biological functions in cell membranes. Recently, N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) has been reported to function as an anorectic hormone secreted from the gut and acting on the brain (Gillum et al., [5]). In the current study, two of our laboratories independently investigated whether NAPE metabolites may be involved in mediating the anorectic action of NAPE i.p. injected in mice. Thus, the anorectic activity of a non-hydrolysable NAPE analogue, having ether bonds instead of ester bonds at sn1 and sn2 was compared with that of NAPE in molar equivalent doses. Furthermore, the anorectic effect of NAPE in NAPE-hydrolysing phospholipase D knockout animals was investigated. As negative controls, the NAPE precursor phosphatidylethanolamine and the related phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid were also tested. All compounds except one were found to inhibit food intake, raising the possibility that the effect of NAPE is non-specific.

Abstract: To clarify the relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death during ischemia–reperfusion (I/R), we studied cell death mechanisms in a cellular model of I/R. Oxidant stress during simulated ischemia was detected in the mitochondrial matrix using mito-roGFP, a ratiometric redox sensor, and by Mito-Sox Red oxidation. Reperfusion-induced death was attenuated by over-expression of Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) or mitochondrial phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (mito-PHGPx), but not by catalase, mitochondria-targeted catalase, or Cu,Zn-SOD. Protection was also conferred by chemically distinct antioxidant compounds, and mito-roGFP oxidation was attenuated by NAC, or by scavenging of residual O2 during the ischemia (anoxic ischemia). Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) oscillation/opening was monitored by real-time imaging of mitochondrial calcein fluorescence. Oxidant stress caused release of calcein to the cytosol during ischemia, a response that was inhibited by chemically diverse antioxidants, anoxia, or over-expression of Mn-SOD or mito-PHGPx. These findings suggest that mitochondrial oxidant stress causes oscillation of the mPTP prior to reperfusion. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol was not detected until after reperfusion, and was inhibited by anoxic ischemia or antioxidant administration during ischemia. Although DNA fragmentation was detected after I/R, no evidence of Bax activation was detected. Over-expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in cardiomyocytes did not confer protection against I/R-induced cell death. Moreover, murine embryonic fibroblasts with genetic depletion of Bax and Bak, or over-expression of Bcl-XL, failed to show protection against I/R. These findings indicate that mitochondrial ROS during ischemia triggers mPTP activation, mitochondrial depolarization, and cell death during reperfusion through a Bax/Bak-independent cell death pathway. Therefore, mitochondrial apoptosis appears to represent a redundant death pathway in this model of simulated I/R. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondria and Cardioprotection.

Abstract: Bioactive N-acylethanolamines include anandamide (an endocannabinoid), N-palmitoylethanolamine (an anti-inflammatory), and N-oleoylethanolamine (an anorexic). In the brain, these molecules are formed from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) by a specific phospholipase D, called NAPE-PLD, or through NAPE-PLD-independent multi-step pathways, as illustrated in the current study employing NAPE-PLD-deficient mice. Although N-acylethanolamine plasmalogen (1-alkenyl-2-acyl-glycero-3-phospho(N-acyl)ethanolamine, pNAPE) is presumably a major class of N-acylethanolamine phospholipids in the brain, its enzymatic conversion to N-acylethanolamines is poorly understood. In the present study, we focused on the formation of N-acylethanolamines from pNAPEs. While recombinant NAPE-PLD catalyzed direct release of N-palmitoylethanolamine from N-palmitoylethanolamine plasmalogen, the same reaction occurred in the brain homogenate of NAPE-PLD-deficient mice, suggesting that this reaction occurs through both the NAPE-PLD-dependent and -independent pathways. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed a remarkable accumulation of 1-alkenyl-2-hydroxy-glycero-3-phospho(N-acyl)ethanolamines (lyso pNAPEs) in the brain of NAPE-PLD-deficient mice. We also found that brain homogenate formed N-palmitoylethanolamine, N-oleoylethanolamine, and anandamide from their corresponding lyso pNAPEs by a Mg2+-dependent “lysophospholipase D”. Moreover, the brain levels of alkenyl-type lysophosphatidic acids, the other products from lyso pNAPEs by lysophospholipase D, also increased in NAPE-PLD-deficient mice. Glycerophosphodiesterase GDE1 can hydrolyze glycerophospho-N-acylethanolamines to N-acylethanolamines in the brain. In addition, we discovered that recombinant GDE1 has a weak activity to generate N-palmitoylethanolamine from its corresponding lyso pNAPE, suggesting that this enzyme is at least in part responsible for the lysophospholipase D activity. These results strongly suggest that brain tissue N-acylethanolamines, including anandamide, can be formed from N-acylated plasmalogen through an NAPE-PLD-independent pathway as well as by their direct release via NAPE-PLD.

Abstract: Integrin signaling is central to cell growth and differentiation, and critical for the processes of apoptosis, cell migration and wound repair. Previous research has demonstrated a requirement for SNARE-dependent membrane traffic in integrin trafficking, as well as cell adhesion and migration. The goal of the present research was to ascertain whether SNARE-dependent membrane trafficking is required specifically for integrin-mediated signaling. Membrane traffic was inhibited in Chinese hamster ovary cells by expression of dominant-negative (E329Q) N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) or a truncated form of the SNARE SNAP23. Integrin signaling was monitored as cells were plated on fibronectin under serum-free conditions. E329Q-NSF expression inhibited phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on Tyr397 at early time points of adhesion. Phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr576, Tyr861 and Tyr925 was also impaired by expression of E329Q-NSF or truncated SNAP23, as was trafficking, localization and activation of Src and its interaction with FAK. Decreased FAK–Src interaction coincided with reduced Rac activation, decreased focal adhesion turnover, reduced Akt phosphorylation and lower phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels in the cell periphery. Over-expression of plasma membrane-targeted Src or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) rescued cell spreading and focal adhesion turnover. The results suggest that SNARE-dependent trafficking is required for integrin signaling through a FAK/Src/PI3K-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Cathepsin D is an aspartic peptidase involved in cellular processes including proliferation and apoptosis and implicated in human pathologies such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Our knowledge about the relationship between proteolysis and bioactive sphingolipids is still very limited. Here, we describe a complex pattern of modulation of the peptidolytic activity of cathepsin D by sphingolipids. A panel of sphingolipid derivatives was screened in a FRET-based assay; these molecules demonstrated negative or positive modulation of cathepsin D peptidolytic activity, depending on the sphingolipid structure. Certain sphingosines and ceramides inhibited cathepsin D in the submicromolar range, and structural requirements for this inhibitory effect were evaluated. The interaction of cathepsin D with sphingolipids was also demonstrated by fluorescence polarization measurements and determined to follow a competitive inhibition mode. In contrast, monoester phosphosphingolipids, especially ceramide-1-phosphate, were identified as activators of cathepsin D peptidolytic activity at submicromolar concentrations. Thus, sphingolipids and phosphosphingolipids, known to be antagonistic in their cell-signaling functions, displayed opposite modulation of cathepsin D. Sphingolipid-based modulators of cathepsin D are potentially involved in the control of cathepsin D-dependent processes and might serve as a scaffold for the development of novel regulators of this therapeutic target.

Abstract: The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has an outstanding capacity to produce and store triacylglycerols resembling adipocytes of higher eukaryotes. Here, the identification of two genes YALI0E32769g (DGA1) and YALI0E16797g (LRO1) encoding major triacylglycerol synthases of Yarrowia lipolytica is reported. Heterologous expression of either DGA1 or LRO1 in a mutant of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in triacylglycerol synthesis restores the formation of this neutral lipid. Whereas Dga1p requires acyl-CoA as a substrate for acylation of diacylglycerol, Lro1p is an acyl-CoA independent triacylglycerol synthase using phospholipids as acyl-donor. Growth of Yarrowia lipolytica strains deleted of DGA1 and/or LRO1 on glucose containing medium significantly decreases triacylglycerol accumulation. Most interestingly, when oleic acid serves as the carbon source the ratio of triacylglycerol accumulation in mutants to wild-type is significantly increased in strains defective in DGA1 but not in lro1Δ. In vitro experiments revealed that under these conditions an additional acyl-CoA dependent triacylglycerol synthase contributes to triacylglycerol synthesis in the respective mutants. Taken together, evidence is provided that Yarrowia lipolytica contains at least four triacylglycerol synthases, namely Lro1p, Dga1p and two additional triacylglycerol synthases whereof one is acyl-CoA dependent and specifically induced upon growth on oleic acid.

Abstract: The physiological responses of AMPA receptors can be modulated through the differential expression of their subunits and by modifying their number at the cell surface. Here we have studied the expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1–4) mRNAs in cerebellar granule cells grown in depolarizing (25mMK+) medium, and we have evaluated the effect of decreasing the [K+] in the culture medium for 24 h on both GluR1–4 expression (both mRNA and protein) and their presence at the plasma membrane. The expression of the four AMPAR subunits increases as the [K+] decreases, although the increase in GluR2 and GluR3 was only observed in the cell soma but not in the dendrites. Calcium entry through L-type calcium channel and CaMKIV activation are responsible for the reduction in the expression of AMPA receptor subunits in cells cultured in depolarizing conditions. Indeed, prolonged reduction of extracellular [K+] or blockage of L-type calcium channels enhanced both the surface insertion of the four AMPAR subunits and the AMPA response measured through intracellular calcium increase. These findings reveal a balanced increase in functional AMPA receptors at the surface of cells that can trigger strong increases in calcium in response to the persistent reduction of calcium entry.

Abstract: In the healthy adult brain microglia, the main immune-competent cells of the CNS, have a distinct (so-called resting or surveying) phenotype. Resting microglia can only be studied in vivo since any isolation of brain tissue inevitably triggers microglial activation. Here we used in vivo two-photon imaging to obtain a first insight into Ca2+ signaling in resting cortical microglia. The majority (80%) of microglial cells showed no spontaneous Ca2+ transients at rest and in conditions of strong neuronal activity. However, they reliably responded with large, generalized Ca2+ transients to damage of an individual neuron. These damage-induced responses had a short latency (0.4–4s) and were localized to the immediate vicinity of the damaged neuron (<50μm cell body-to-cell body distance). They were occluded by the application of ATPγS as well as UDP and 2-MeSADP, the agonists of metabotropic P2Y receptors, and they required Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Thus, our in vivo data suggest that microglial Ca2+ signals occur mostly under pathological conditions and identify a Ca2+ store-operated signal, which represents a very sensitive, rapid, and highly localized response of microglial cells to brain damage. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 11th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Mutations in ABCG5 or ABCG8 transporters are responsible for sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the accumulation of plant sterols. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ABCG5 and ABCG8 deficiency on TG metabolism in mice. Experiments were carried out in wild-type (G5/G8+/+) mice, mice heterozygous for ABCG5 and ABCG8 deficiency (G5/G8+/−) and ABCG5/G8-deficient (G5/G8−/−) mice fed a chow diet. Plasma TG were 2.6 and 4.3-fold higher in fasted G5/G8+/− and G5/G8−/− mice, respectively, than in G5/G8+/+ mice. Postprandial TG were 5-fold higher in G5/G8−/− mice. TG metabolism studies indicate that: first, the fractional catabolic rate was significantly lower in G5/G8+/− (1.3-fold) and G5/G8−/− mice (1.5-fold) compared to G5/G8+/+ and postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase activities were significantly lower in G5/G8+/− (1.8-fold) and G5/G8−/− mice (5.4-fold) than in G5/G8+/+. Second, liver TG secretion was 1.3-fold higher in G5/G8+/− and G5/G8−/− than in G5/G8+/+ mice and this was associated with an increase in liver LXR, FAS, ACAC and CD36 gene expression. Third, TG intestinal secretion, determined after an oral fat gavage of glycerol tri[9,10(n)-3H] oleate, was 5.8-fold higher in G5/G8−/− than in G5/G8+/+ mice. Also, the HOMA index was 2.6-fold higher in G5/G8−/− than in G5/G8+/+ mice, reflecting a degree of insulin resistance. In conclusion, ABCG5/G8 deficiency in mice fed a chow diet markedly raises TG levels by impairing TG catabolism and by increasing liver and intestinal TG secretion.

Abstract: A novel sphingomyelin-binding protein (clamlysin) was purified from the foot muscle of a brackishwater clam, Corbicula japonica. The purified 24.8-kDa protein lysed sheep, horse and rabbit erythrocytes and the hemolytic activity was inhibited by sphingomyelin, but not other phospholipids or glycosphingolipids. The open reading frame of the clamlysin gene encoded a putative 26.9-kDa protein (clamlysin B) which showed high sequence similarity with the actinoporin family. A surface plasmon resonance assay confirmed that clamlysin B specifically bound to sphingomyelin. Furthermore, two cDNA variants of clamlysin, encoding putative 31.4 kDa (clamlysin A) and 11 kDa (clamlysin C) proteins, were isolated. Only the 31.4-kDa variant was found to exhibit sphingomyelin-binding activity. Clamlysin A and B, but not C, shared a sequence (domain II) conserved in all known sphingomyelin-binding proteins. Domain II fused with a glutathione S-transferase bound to sphingomyelin. Horse erythrocytes, mouse melanoma B16 and GM95 cells, and Chinese hamster ovary CHO-K1 cells, but not the same cells treated with bacterial sphingomyelinase, were immunostained with clamlysin B. These results indicate that clamlysin B binds to the sphingomyelin of living cells and thus would be useful as a molecular probe to detect sphingomyelin.

Abstract: Conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) exhibit growth inhibitory effects on colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. To investigate whether the anticancerogenic potency depends on number or configuration of the conjugated double bonds, the effect of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; C18:2) isomers and conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA; C18:3) isomers on viability and growth of HT-29 cells were compared. Low concentrations of CLnAs (<10μM) yielded a higher degree of inhibitory effects compared to CLAs (40μM). All trans-CFAs were more effective compared to cis/trans-CFAs as follows: t9,t11,t13-CLnA≥c9,t11,t13-CLnA>t11,t13-CLA≥t9,t11-CLA>c9,t11-CLA. The mRNA expression analysis of important genes associated with fatty acid metabolism showed an absence of ∆5-/∆6-desaturases and elongases in HT-29 cells, which was confirmed by fatty acid analysis. Using time- and dose-dependent stimulation experiments several metabolites were determined. Low concentrations of all trans-CFAs (5–20μM) led to dose-dependent increase of conjugated t/t-C16:2 formed by β-oxidation of C18 CFAs, ranging from 1–5% of total FAME. Importantly, it was found that CLnA is converted to CLA and that CLA is inter-converted (t11,t13-CLA is metabolized to c9,t11-CLA) by HT-29 cells. In summary, our study shows that growth inhibition of human cancer cells is associated with a specific cellular transcriptomic and metabolic profile of fatty acid metabolism, which might contribute to the diversified ability of CFAs as anti-cancer compounds.

The maximal cytoprotective function of the heat shock protein 27 is dependent on heat shock protein 70,

Abstract: Endogenous heat shock proteins (HSPs) 70 and 25/27 are induced in renal cells by injury from energy depletion. Transfected over-expression of HSPs 70 or 27 (human analogue of HSP25), provide protection against renal cell injury from ATP deprivation. This study examines whether over-expressed HSP27 depends on induction of endogenous HSPs, in particular HSP70, to afford protection against cell injury. LLC-PK1 cells transfected with HSP27 (27OE cells) were injured by ATP depletion for 2h and recovered for 4h in the presence of HSF decoy, HSP70 specific siRNA (siRNA-70) and their respective controls. Injury in the presence of HSF decoy, a synthetic oligonucleotide identical to the heat shock element, the nuclear binding site of HSF, decreased HSP70 induction by 80% without affecting the over-expression of transfected HSP27. The HSP70 stress response was completely ablated in the presence of siRNA-70. Protection against injury, provided by over-expression of HSP27, was reduced by treatment with HSF decoy and abolished by treatment with siRNA-70. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated association of HSP27 with actin that was not affected by either treatment with HSF decoy or siRNA. Therefore, HSP27 is dependent on HSP70 to provide its maximal cytoprotective effect, but not for its interaction with actin. This study suggests that, while it has specific action on the cytoskeleton, HSP 25/27 must have coordinated activity with other HSP classes, especially HSP70, to provide the full extent of resistance to injury from energy depletion.

Abstract: Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) is found at increased levels in the malignant ascites of tumor patients and induces perinuclear reorganization of keratin 8 (K8) filaments that contribute to the viscoelasticity of metastatic cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the role and molecular mechanisms of Tgase-2 in SPC-induced K8 phosphorylation and perinuclear reorganization in PANC-1 cells (PANWT), and in PANC-1 cells that stably expressed shTgase-2 or Tgase-2 (PANshTg2 and PANTg2). SPC induces the expression of Tgase-2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Gene silencing of Tgase-2 or cystamine suppressed the SPC-induced phosphorylation and perinuclear reorganization of K8 and suppressed the SPC-induced migration of PANC-1 cells. An inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), SP600125, suppressed the SPC-induced phosphorylation of serine 431 in K8 and keratin reorganization. Next, we examined the effect of Tgase-2 on JNK activation of serine 431 phosphorylation in K8. Tgase-2 gene silencing suppressed the expression of active form JNK (pJNK). Constitutive or tetracyclin-induced conditional expression of Tgase-2 increased the levels of pJNK. Tgase-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with K8 and JNK. In addition, K8 was coimmunoprecipitated with Tgase-2 and JNK. JNK was also coimmunoprecipitated with K8 and Tgase-2. Overall, these results suggest that Tgase-2 is involved in SPC-induced phosphorylation and perinuclear reorganization of K8 by activating JNK and forming a triple complex with K8 and JNK. Therefore, SPC-induced Tgase-2 might be a new target for modulating keratin reorganization, metastasis of cancer cells and JNK activation.

Abstract: The regulatory control mechanisms of lipid and fatty acid metabolism were investigated in Atlantic salmon. We identified sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) genes in salmon and characterised their response, and the response of potential target and other regulatory genes including liver X receptor (LXR), to cholesterol and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in the salmon established cell line, SHK-1. Two cDNAs for SREBPs homologous to mammalian SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were characterised. We identified three groups of genes whose expression responded differently to the treatments. One group of genes, including cholesterol biosynthetic genes, showed increased expression in response to lipid depletion but supplementary cholesterol or LC-PUFA had no further effect. The expression of a second group of genes belonging to fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, included fatty acid synthase, Δ6 and Δ5 fatty acyl desaturases, also increased after lipid depletion but this was negated by cholesterol or by LC-PUFA supplementation. The expression of a third group of genes including acyl-CoA oxidase, HMG-CoA reductase and Elovl5 elongase was increased by cholesterol treatment but was not affected by lipid depletion or by LC-PUFA. This same pattern of expression was also shown by liver X receptor (LXR), indicating that acyl-CoA oxidase, HMG-CoA reductase and Elovl5 are possible direct targets of LXR. This suggests that salmon Elovl5 may be regulated differently from mammalian Elovl5, which is an indirect target of LXR, responding to LXR-dependent increases in SREBP-1.

Abstract: The nuclear receptors Liver X receptors, LXRα and LXRβ, regulate cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism. We and others have previously reported that synthetic LXR agonists reduced atherosclerosis in models of mouse with no detectable plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, which plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport. In the present study, we investigated the effect of LXR activation in rabbits to elucidate the influence of CETP activity. First, we cloned rabbit LXRs cDNA. The data indicated that rabbit LXRα was mostly highly expressed in the liver, whereas LXRβ expression was ubiquitous. Next, we investigated the effect of LXR agonist on lipid levels. Treatment with LXR agonist T0901317 increased plasma CETP activity and consequently elevated LDL, but no change in HDL. High cholesterol (HC) diet-feeding, which is thought to provide oxysterols as the natural agonists, could also increase expression of CETP and other LXR target genes. Finally, we tested T0901317 in the atherosclerosis intervention study. Chronic administration of T0901317 significantly reduced atherosclerosis in HC diet-fed rabbits despite less favorable lipid profiles, i.e. increases of plasma triglycerides and no change of HDL. T0901317 induced ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 and suppressed inflammatory genes expression in the aorta, suggesting that direct actions of LXR agonist on vascular gene expression are likely to contribute to the antiatherogenic effect. The present work strongly supports the idea that LXR agonists could be beneficial as therapeutic agents for treatment of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Fatty acid-derived eicosanoids and N-acylethanolamines (NAE) are important bioactive lipid mediators involved in numerous biological processes including cell signaling and disease progression. To facilitate research on these lipid mediators, we have developed a targeted high-throughput mass spectrometric based methodology to monitor and quantitate both eicosanoids and NAEs, and can be analyzed separately or together in series. Each methodology utilizes scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) pairs in conjunction with a 25min reverse-phase HPLC separation. The eicosanoid methodology monitors 141 unique metabolites and quantitative amounts can be determined for over 100 of these metabolites against standards. The analysis covers eicosanoids generated from cycloxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and those generated from non-enzymatic pathways. The NAE analysis monitors 36 metabolites and quantitative amounts can be determined for 33 of these metabolites against standards. The NAE method contains metabolites derived from saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and eicosanoids. The lower limit of detection for eicosanoids ranges from 0.1pg to 1pg, while NAEs ranges from 0.1pg to 1000pg. The rationale and design of the methodology is discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipodomics and Imaging Mass Spectrometry.

Abstract: Aims. The study aims to determine the effect of long-chain saturated and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids, specifically palmitic acid (PA; 16:0), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n-6), and their interactions with factors from adipose tissue, on insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle. Methods. L6 myotubes were cultured with PA, DHA or LA (0.4mmol/l), with or without conditioned media from human subcutaneous (SC) and visceral (IAB) fat. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, lipid content, mRNA expression of key genes involved in nutrient utilization and protein expression of inhibitor protein inhibitor kappa B (IκB)-α and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were measured. Results. PA and IAB fat reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and their combined effect was similar to that of PA alone. PA-induced insulin resistance was ameliorated by inhibiting the de novo synthesis of ceramide, IκBα degradation or mTOR activation. The PA effect was also partially reversed by DHA and completely by LA in the presence of SC fat. PA increased diacylglycerol content, which was reduced by LA and to a greater extent when either IAB or SC fat was also present. PA increased SCD1 whereas DHA and LA increased AMPKα2 mRNA. In the presence of SC or IAB fat, the combination of PA with either DHA or LA decreased SCD1 and increased AMPKα2 mRNA. Conclusions. PA-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle involves inflammatory (nuclear factor kappa B/mTOR) and nutrient (ceramide) pathways. PUFAs promote pathways, at a transcriptional level, that increase fat oxidation and synergize with factors from SC fat to abrogate PA-induced insulin resistance.

Abstract: The study of lipids has developed into a research field of increasing importance as their multiple biological roles in cell biology, physiology and pathology are becoming better understood. The Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS) consortium is actively involved in an integrated approach for the detection, quantitation and pathway reconstruction of lipids and related genes and proteins at a systems-biology level. A key component of this approach is a bioinformatics infrastructure involving a clearly defined classification of lipids, a state-of-the-art database system for molecular species and experimental data and a suite of user-friendly tools to assist lipidomics researchers. Herein, we discuss a number of recent developments by the LIPID MAPS bioinformatics core in pursuit of these objectives. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipodomics and Imaging Mass Spectrometry.

Abstract: In order to investigate the cell death-inducing effects of rotenone, a plant extract commonly used as a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, we studied cancer cell lines with different genetic backgrounds. Rotenone inhibits cell growth through the induction of cell death and cell cycle arrest, associated with the development of mitotic catastrophe. The cell death inducer staurosporine potentiates the inhibition of cell growth by rotenone in a dose-dependent synergistic manner. The tumor suppressor p53 is involved in rotenone-induced cell death, since the drug treatment results in increased expression, phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the protein. The evaluation of the effects of rotenone on a p53-deficient cell line revealed that although not required for the promotion of mitotic catastrophe, functional p53 appears to be essential for the extensive cell death that occurs afterwards. Our results suggest that mitotic slippage also occurs subsequently to the rotenone-induced mitotic arrest and cells treated with the drug for a longer period become senescent. Treatment of mtDNA-depleted cells with rotenone induces cell death and cell cycle arrest as in cells containing wild-type mtDNA, but not formation of reactive oxygen species. This suggests that the effects of rotenone are not dependent from the production of reactive oxygen species. This work highlights the multiple effects of rotenone in cancer cells related to its action as an anti-mitotic drug.

Abstract: Apo-10'-lycopenoic acid (apo-10-lycac), a metabolite of lycopene, has been shown to possess potent biological activities, notably via the retinoic acid receptors (RAR). In the current study, its impact on adipose tissue and adipocytes was studied. In microarray experiments, the set of genes regulated by apo-10-lycac treatments was compared to the set of genes regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the natural ligand of RAR, in adipocytes. Approximately 27.5% of the genes regulated by apo-10-lycac treatments were also regulated by ATRA, suggesting a common ability in terms of gene expression modulation, possibly via RAR transactivation. The physiological impact of apo-10-lycac on adipose tissue biology was evaluated. If it had no effect on adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 cell model, this metabolite may have a preventative effect against inflammation, by preventing the increase in the inflammatory markers, interleukin 6 and interleukin 1β in various dedicated models. The ability of apo-10-lycac to transactivate the RAR and to modulate the transcription of RAR target gene was brought in vivo in adipose tissue. While apo-10-lycac was not detected in adipose tissue, a metabolite with a molecular weight with 2Da larger mass was detected, suggesting that a dihydro-apo-10'-lycopenoic acid, may be present in adipose tissue and that this compound could active or may lead to further active RAR-activating apo-10-lycac metabolites. Since apo-10-lycac treatments induce anti-inflammatory effects in adipose tissue but do not inhibit adipogenesis, we propose that apo-10-lycac treatments and its potential active metabolites in WAT may be considered for prevention strategies relevant for obesity-associated pathologies.

Abstract: Endocrine cells, such as H295R have been widely used to study secretion of steroid and other hormones. Exocytosis-dependent hormone release is accompanied by an increase in plasma membrane surface area and a decrease in vesicle content. Recovery of vesicles and decrease in plasma membrane area is achieved by endocytotic processes. These changes in the extent of the surface area lead to morphological changes which can be determined by label-free real-time impedance measurements. Exo- and endocytosis have been described to be triggered by activation of L-type Ca2+ channels. The present study demonstrates that activation of L-type calcium channels induces prolonged oscillating changes in cellular impedance. The data support the hypothesis that a tight regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is a prerequisite for the observed cellular impedance oscillations. Furthermore evidence is presented for a mechanism in which the oscillations depend on a Ca2+-triggered calmodulin-dependent cascade involving myosin light chain kinase, nonmuscle myosin II and ultimately actin polymerization, a known determinant for cell shape changes and exocytosis in secretory cells. The described assay provides a method to determine continuously prolonged changes in cellular morphology such as exo/endocytosis cycles.

2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin impairs iron homeostasis by modulating iron-related proteins expression and increasing the labile iron pool in mammalian cells,

Abstract: Cellular iron metabolism is essentially controlled by the binding of cytosolic iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 or IRP2) to iron-responsive elements (IREs) located on mRNAs coding for proteins involved in iron acquisition, utilization and storage. The 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is one of the most potent toxins of current interest that occurs as poisonous chemical in the environment. TCDD exposure has been reported to induce a broad spectrum of toxic and biological responses, including significant changes in gene expression for heme and iron metabolism associated with liver injury. Here, we have investigated the molecular effects of TCDD on the iron metabolism providing the first evidence that administration of the toxin TCDD to mammalian cells affects the maintenance of iron homeostasis. We found that exposure of Madin–Darby Bovine Kidney cell to TCDD caused a divergent modulation of IRP1 and IRP2 RNA-binding capacity. Interestingly, we observed a concomitant IRP1 down-regulation and IRP2 up-regulation thus determining a marked enhancement of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR-1) expression and a biphasic response in ferritin content. The changed ferritin content coupled to TfR-1 induction after TCDD exposure impairs the cellular iron homeostasis, ultimately leading to significant changes in the labile iron pool (LIP) extent. Since important iron requirement changes occur during the regulation of cell growth, it is not surprising that the dioxin-dependent iron metabolism dysregulation herein described may be linked to cell-fate decision, supporting the hypothesis of a central connection among exposure to dioxins and the regulation of critical cellular processes.

Abstract: Intestinal and liver fatty acid binding proteins (IFABP and LFABP, respectively) are cytosolic soluble proteins with the capacity to bind and transport hydrophobic ligands between different sub-cellular compartments. Their functions are still not clear but they are supposed to be involved in lipid trafficking and metabolism, cell growth, and regulation of several other processes, like cell differentiation. Here we investigated the interaction of these proteins with different models of phospholipid membrane vesicles in order to achieve further insight into their specificity within the enterocyte. A combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques allowed us to determine affinities of these proteins to membranes, the way phospholipid composition and vesicle size and curvature modulate such interaction, as well as the effect of protein binding on the integrity of the membrane structure. We demonstrate here that, besides their apparently opposite ligand transfer mechanisms, both LFABP and IFABP are able to interact with phospholipid membranes, but the factors that modulate such interactions are different for each protein, further implying different roles for IFABP and LFABP in the intracellular context. These results contribute to the proposed central role of intestinal FABPs in the lipid traffic within enterocytes as well as in the regulation of more complex cellular processes.

S100B in myoblasts regulates the transition from activation to quiescence and from quiescence to activation and reduces apoptosis,

Abstract: S100B protein activates IKKβ/NF-κB within myoblasts, thereby inhibiting the expression of MyoD and the MyoD-downstream effectors, myogenin and p21WAF1, and myoblast differentiation. Herein we show that myoblasts downregulate S100B expression once transferred from proliferation medium to differentiation medium via a p38 MAPK-driven transcriptional mechanism as well as a post-translational, proteasome-dependent mechanism, and that myoblasts that have not been committed to differentiation resume expressing S100B once transferred back to proliferation medium. Likewise, myoblasts downregulate S100B expression once transferred to quiescence medium, and interference with S100B downregulation as obtained by stable overexpression of the protein results in reduced acquisition of quiescence and a faster proliferation upon transfer of the cells from quiescence medium to proliferation medium, compared to controls. These latter effects are dependent on S100B-induced activation of JNK. Moreover, S100B reduces myoblast apoptosis in an MEK-ERK1/2, Akt, JNK, and NF-κB-dependent manner. However, myogenin+ myoblasts (i.e., myocytes) and myotubes abundantly express S100B likely induced by myogenin. Our results suggest that (1) a timely repression of S100B expression is required for efficient myogenic differentiation; (2) S100B plays an important role in the expansion of the activated (i.e., proliferating) myoblast population; (3) under conditions associated with enhanced expression of S100B, the transition from proliferation to quiescence and from quiescence to proliferation might be altered; and (4) S100B exerts different regulatory effects in myoblasts and myocytes/myotubes/myofibers.

Abstract: Scutellaria baicalensis (SB) and SB-derived polyphenols possess anti-proliferative activities in several cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PaCa). However, the precise molecular mechanisms have not been fully defined. SB extract and SB-derived polyphenols (wogonin, baicalin, and baicalein) were used to determine their anti-proliferative mechanisms. Baicalein significantly inhibited the proliferation of PaCa cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, whereas wogonin and baicalin exhibited a much less robust effect. Treatment with baicalein induced apoptosis with release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and activation of caspase-3 and -7 and PARP. The general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk reversed baicalein-induced apoptosis, indicating a caspase-dependent mechanism. Baicalein decreased expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family, presumably through a transcriptional mechanism. Genetic knockdown of Mcl-1 resulted in marked induction of apoptosis. The effect of baicalein on apoptosis was significantly attenuated by Mcl-1 over-expression, suggesting a critical role of Mcl-1 in this process. Our results provide evidence that baicalein induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells through down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein.

The kinesin superfamily protein KIF17 is regulated by the same transcription factor (NRF-1) as its cargo NR2B in neurons,

Abstract: The kinesin superfamily of motor proteins is known to be ATP-dependent transporters of various types of cargoes. In neurons, KIF17 is found to transport vesicles containing the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit from the cell body specifically to the dendrites. These subunits are intimately associated with glutamatergic neurotransmission as well as with learning and memory. Glutamatergic synapses are highly energy-dependent, and recently we found that the same transcription factor, nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), co-regulates energy metabolism (via its regulation of cytochrome c oxidase and other mitochondrial enzymes) and neurochemicals of glutamatergic transmission (NR1, NR2B, GluR2, and nNOS). The present study tested our hypothesis that NRF-1 also transcriptionally regulates KIF17. By means of in silico analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, promoter mutations, and real-time quantitative PCR, we found that NRF-1 (but not NRF-2) functionally regulates Kif17, but not Kif1a, gene. NRF-1 binding sites on Kif17 gene are highly conserved among mice, rats, and humans. Silencing of NRF-1 with small interference RNA blocked the up-regulation of Kif17 mRNA and proteins (and of Grin1 and Grin2b) induced by KCl-mediated depolarization, whereas over-expressing NRF-1 rescued these transcripts and proteins from being suppressed by TTX. Thus, NRF-1 co-regulates oxidative enzymes that generate energy and neurochemicals that consume energy related to glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as KIF17, NR1, and NR2B, thereby ensuring that energy production matches energy utilization at the molecular and cellular levels.

Abstract: StarD4 is a member of the StarD4 subfamily of START domain proteins with a characteristic lipid binding pocket specific for cholesterol. The objective of this study was to define StarD4 subcellular localization, regulation, and function. Immunobloting showed that StarD4 is highly expressed in the mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1, in human THP-1 macrophages, Kupffer cells (liver macrophages), and hepatocytes. In 3T3-L1 cells and THP-1 macrophages, StarD4 protein appeared localized to the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). More specifically, in THP-1 macrophages StarD4 co-localized to areas of the ER enriched in Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1), and was closely associated with budding lipid droplets. The addition of purified StarD4 recombinant protein to an in vitro assay increased ACAT activity 2-fold, indicating that StarD4 serves as a rate-limiting step in cholesteryl ester formation by delivering cholesterol to ACAT-1-enriched ER. In addition, StarD4 protein was found to be highly regulated and to redistribute in response to sterol levels. In summary, these observations, together with our previous findings demonstrating the ability of increased StarD4 expression to increase bile acid synthesis and cholesteryl ester formation, provide strong evidence for StarD4 as a highly regulated, non-vesicular, directional, intracellular transporter of cholesterol which plays a key role in the maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.

Abstract: Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is highly expressed in the small intestine across mammalian species and is the target of ezetimibe, a potent cholesterol absorption inhibitor. In humans, NPC1L1 is also expressed in the liver. We found that transgenic overexpression of NPC1L1 in the wild-type mouse liver inhibits biliary cholesterol secretion and raises blood cholesterol, which can be reversed by ezetimibe treatment. Unfortunately, the high expression of endogenous NPC1L1 in the intestine hampered a definitive establishment of the role of hepatic NPC1L1 in cholesterol metabolism and ezetimibe action in the liver because intestinal NPC1L1 dramatically influences cholesterol homeostasis and is a target of ezetimibe. To circumvent this obstacle, we crossed liver-specific NPC1L1 transgenic mice to NPC1L1 knockout (L1-KO) mice and created a mouse line expressing no endogenous NPC1L1, but human NPC1L1 in liver only (L1LivOnly mice). Compared to L1-KO mice, L1LivOnly mice on a 0.2% cholesterol diet showed significantly increased hepatic and plasma cholesterol, and despite a 90% reduction in biliary cholesterol excretion, their fecal cholesterol excretion remained completely unaltered. Remarkably, 4days of ezetimibe treatment significantly restored biliary cholesterol secretion in L1LivOnly mice. These findings demonstrated a direct role of hepatic NPC1L1 in regulating biliary cholesterol excretion and hepatic/blood cholesterol levels, and unequivocally established hepatic NPC1L1 as a target of ezetimibe.

Abstract: Following the discovery of the endocannabinoid arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and other N-acyl-ethanolamines, several other compounds have been found in which amino acids or neurotransmitters rather than ethanolamide are linked to fatty acids. Studies have shown that the local availability of fatty acid precursors, which in turn is modulated by dietary intake of lipids, determines the pattern of conjugates formed. Less information is available whether the same might be true for the amines or neurotransmitters involved. We hypothesized that N-arachidonoyl-serotonin (AA-5-HT) and its analogs could be endogenously present in those tissues that have high contents of serotonin. We investigated the endogenous presence of N-acyl serotonins in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract of pigs and mice. We discovered that AA-5-HT, oleoyl-serotonin, palmitoyl-serotonin, and stearoyl-serotonin were endogenously present, particularly in the jejunum and ileum. Their formation in vitro was stimulated by the addition of serotonin to intestinal tissue incubations. Furthermore, in a mouse study we showed that the pattern of formation is dependent on the relative amount of fatty acids in the diet. The formation of docosahexaenoyl-serotonin and eicosapentaenoyl-serotonin was elevated in mice fed with a diet containing fish oil. Preliminary data showed that several of the serotonin conjugates are able to inhibit glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion and FAAH activity in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that N-acyl serotonins are a novel class of lipid mediators present in the gut with highly promising biological properties.

Abstract: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that localizes to myelin sheaths in the central nervous system. MOG has important implications in multiple sclerosis, as pathogenic anti-MOG antibodies have been detected in the sera of multiple sclerosis patients. As a membrane protein, MOG achieves its native structure in the endoplasmic reticulum where its folding is expected to be controlled by endoplasmic reticulum chaperones. Calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 are essential components of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control where they assist in the proper folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. In this study, we show that expression of MOG is not affected by the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control proteins calnexin, calreticulin, or ERp57. We also show that calnexin forms complexes with MOG and these interactions might be glycan-independent. Importantly, we show that cell surface targeting of MOG is not disrupted in the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones.

Abstract: Triacylglycerols (TG) are the major storage molecules of metabolic energy and fatty acids in several tissues. The final step in TG biosynthesis is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes. Lack of whole body DGAT1 is associated with reduced lipid-induced inflammation. Since one major component of atherosclerosis is chronic inflammation we hypothesized that DGAT1 deficiency might ameliorate atherosclerotic lesion development. We therefore crossbred Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE−/−) mice with Dgat1−/− mice. ApoE−/− and ApoE−/−Dgat1−/− mice were fed Western-type diet (WTD) for 9weeks and thereafter examined for plaque formation. The mean atherosclerotic lesion area was substantially reduced in ApoE−/−Dgat1−/− compared with ApoE−/− mice in en face and aortic valve section analyses. The reduced lesion size was associated with decreased cholesterol uptake and absorption by the intestine, reduced plasma TG and cholesterol concentrations and increased cholesterol efflux from macrophages. The expression of adhesion molecules was reduced in aortas of ApoE−/−Dgat1−/− mice, which might be the reason for less migration capacities of monocytes and macrophages and the observed decreased amount of macrophages within the plaques. From our results we conclude that the lack of DGAT1 is atheroprotective, implicating an additional application of DGAT1 inhibitors with regard to maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and attenuating atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Mass spectrometric techniques have been developed to record mass spectra of biomolecules including lipids as they naturally exist within tissues and thereby permit the generation of images displaying the distribution of specific lipids in tissues, organs, and intact animals. These techniques are based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) that requires matrix application onto the tissue surface prior to analysis. One technique of application that has recently shown significant advantages for lipid analysis is sublimation of matrix followed by vapor deposition directly onto the tissue. Explanations for enhanced sensitivity realized by sublimation/deposition related to sample temperature after a laser pulse and matrix crystal size are presented. Specific examples of sublimation/deposition in lipid imaging of various organs including brain, ocular tissue, and kidney are presented.
