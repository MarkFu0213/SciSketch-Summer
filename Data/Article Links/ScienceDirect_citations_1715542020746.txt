Abstract: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is caused by mutational inactivation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) gene, which is involved in DNA repair. Increased oxidative stress has been shown in human AT cells and neuronal tissues of Atm-deficient mice. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible antioxidant enzyme and protects cells against oxidative stress. The purpose of this study is to determine whether ATM induces antioxidant enzyme HO-1 and protects cells from oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis by driving the activation of PKC-δ and NF-κB, by increasing cell viability, and by downregulating DNA fragmentation and apoptotic indicators (apoptosis-inducing factor and cleaved caspase-3). AT fibroblasts stably transfected with human full-length ATM cDNA (YZ5 cells) or the empty vector (MOCK cells) were treated with H2O2 as a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, transfection with ATM inhibited ROS-induced cell death and DNA fragmentation in MOCK cells. Transfection with ATM induced expression of HO-1 which was mediated by PKC-δ and NF-κB in H2O2-treated MOCK cells. ZnPP, an HO-1 inhibitor, and transfection with HO-1 siRNA increased ROS levels and apoptosis, whereas hemin, an HO-1 activator, reduced ROS levels and apoptosis in H2O2-treated YZ5 cells. Rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, inhibited NF-κB activation and HO-1 expression in H2O2-treated YZ5 cells. MOCK cells showed increased cell death, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic indicators compared to YZ5 cells exposed to H2O2. In addition, transfection with p65 siRNA increased ROS levels and DNA fragmentation, but decreased HO-1 protein levels in H2O2-treated YZ5 cells. In conclusion, ATM induces HO-1 expression via activation of PKC-δ and NF-κB and inhibits oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. A loss of HO-1 induction may explain why AT patients are vulnerable to oxidative stress.

Abstract: Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating toward osteoblatic and adipocytic phenotypes. BM-MSCs play several key roles including bone remodeling, establishment of hematopoietic niche and immune tolerance induction. Here, we investigated the effect of resveratrol (RSV), a therapeutically promising natural polyphenol, on the commitment of human BM-MSCs primary cultures. Cell differentiation was evaluated by means of morphological analysis, specific staining and expression of osteogenic and adipocytic master genes (Runx-2, PPARγ). To maintain BM-MSC multipotency, all experiments were performed on cells at very early passages. At any concentration RSV, added to standard medium, did not affect the phenotype of confluent BM-MSCs, while, when added to osteogenic or adipogenic medium, 1μM RSV enhances the differentiation toward osteoblasts or adipocytes, respectively. Conversely, the addition of higher RSV concentration (25μM) to both differentiation media resulted exclusively in BM-MSCs adipogenesis. Surprisingly, the analysis of RSV molecular effects demonstrated that the compound completely substitutes insulin, a key component of adipogenic medium. We also observed that RSV treatment is associated to enhanced phosphorylation of CREB, a critical effector of insulin adipogenic activity. Finally, our observations contribute to the mechanistic elucidation of the well-known RSV positive effect on insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: A single layer anti-reflective (AR) mesoporous silica nanoparticles coating on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells has been fabricated. Unlike traditional vacuum deposited AR coatings, this nanoparticle coating is applied using simple wet deposition techniques. In this study we investigate the structural properties and anti-reflection effects of the nanoparticle coating on the CIGS solar cell. The reduction in reflection and increase in the short circuit current shows the potential of this nanoparticle coating to compete with current technology.

Abstract: Bulk heterojunction films, which typically comprise a polymer donor and fullerene acceptor, are considerably stiffer than films of the neat polymer. The increase in stiffness upon blending is dependent on the miscibility of the polymer and the fullerene, and potentially on the details of molecular mixing, in particular, intercalation of the fullerene molecules between the polymer side chains. This paper describes the effects of molecular mixing on the tensile modulus of polythiophenes in 1:1 blends with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). A series of four polymers and their blends with PC61BM are tested using mechanical, spectroscopic, and photovoltaic device-based measurements to determine if it is possible to predict trends in the tensile modulus based on the extent of molecular mixing. The four polymers are poly-2,2′:5′,2″-(3,3″-dihexyl-terthiophene) (PT2T), which forms an amorphous, molecularly mixed composite, poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT), which forms a well ordered blend with bimolecular crystallization, and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(3-heptylthiophene) (P3HpT), which form a ternary blend with an amorphous mixed phase. The tensile moduli are measured by the buckling technique and correlations are found between the modulus of the neat polymer and the blends. Although spectroscopic and photovoltaic device-based measurements of P3HT:PC61BM and PT2T:PC61BM, along with literature precedent, suggest completely different extents of molecular mixing, they were found to have similar moduli (2.75±0.59GPa and 2.61±0.39GPa, after annealing). A strong correlation between the moduli of the blended films and the moduli of the neat polymers suggest that the stiffness of the blend is determined to a large extent by that of the polymer, and is unexpectedly insensitive to the details of molecular mixing, at least for the materials investigated.

Abstract: Polymer/small-molecule parallel-connected tandem organic solar cells are explored as a simple platform for high-efficiency tandem solar cells that are not subject to complications associated with complex current matching or successive solution processing. In particular, MoOx/Ag/MoOx (MAM) trilayer electrodes are investigated as an intermediate electrode that connects a front subcell composed of a solution-processed bulk heterojunction of poly{2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl) benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene-alt-5-dibutyloctyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione} (PBDTT-DPP) and the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and a back subcell composed of a thermally evaporated C70 layer doped with 1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane (TAPC). The effect of each MoOx layer is analyzed in terms of both optical and electrical properties. A joint theoretical and experimental study indicates that the electric field is distributed along the cell depth such that the photogenerated current of the front subcell depends on the thickness of both MoOx layers, with a varied interference effect, and that of the back subcell depends primarily on the thickness of the adjacent MoOx layer, with a varied cavity resonance effect. Based on optimized conditions of MAM electrodes, parallel tandem hybrid organic solar cells having higher power conversion efficiency than that of single junction cells are successfully realized.

Abstract: Chromatin structure promotes important epigenetic mechanisms that regulate cellular fate by organizing, preserving and controlling the way by which the genetic information works. Our understanding of chromatin and its functions is sparse and not yet well defined. The uncertainty comes from the complexity of chromatin and is induced by the existence of a large number of nuclear proteins that influence it. The intricate interaction among all these structural and functional nuclear proteins has been under extensive study in the recent years. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone physically interacts with Arp4p (actin-related protein 4) which is a key subunit of three chromatin modifying complexes – INO80, SWR1 and NuA4. A single – point mutation in the actin – fold domain of Arp4p together with the knock-out of the gene for the linker histone in S. cerevisiae severely abrogates cellular and nuclear morphology and leads to complete disorganizing of the higher levels of chromatin organization.

Paeoniflorin diminishes ConA-induced IL-8 production in primary human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells in the involvement of ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation,

Abstract: Liver diseases are closely associated with elevated levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), suggesting the ability to inhibit IL-8 production could enhance the treatment of liver diseases. Paeoniflorin is a major active constituent of dried Paeoniae Radix Alba root (Baishao in Chinese) which is widely used in China to treat liver diseases. We examined the effects and underlying mechanisms of paeoniflorin on IL-8 production in primary human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSECs). Concanavalin A (ConA) at 20μg/mL produced a 5.2-fold increase in IL-8 mRNA by 8h, and a 14.2-fold rise in IL-8 levels by 16h. Inhibition of MEK (ERK kinase) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by PD98059 and U0126, or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by LY294002 blocked both ConA-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and IL-8 secretion. Paeoniflorin reduced ConA-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and IL-8 release by 57.9% and 52.8%, respectively, and also decreased ConA-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, suggesting paeoniflorin inhibits IL-8 expression and release by inhibiting the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways. Combining paeoniflorin with U0126 or LY294002 at low doses showed supra-additive inhibition of not only phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-Akt by 46.4% and 35.0%, but also IL-8 release by 42.4% and 36.1% and IL-8 mRNA expression by 43.5% and 31.8%, respectively. In conclusion, paeoniflorin most likely contributes to the therapy for liver disease by exerting anti-inflammatory effects on HHSECs through blocking IL-8 secretion via downregulation of ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation.

Abstract: Although Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells have the highest efficiency of any thin-film solar cell, especially when sodium is incorporated, the fundamental device properties of ultrafast carrier transport and recombination in such cells remain not fully understood. Here, we explore the dynamics of charge carriers in CIGS absorber layers with varying concentrations of Na by femtosecond (fs) broadband pump-probe reflectance spectroscopy with 120fs time resolution. By analyzing the time-resolved transient spectra in a different time domain, we show that a small amount of Na integrated by NaF deposition on top of sputtered Cu(In,Ga) prior to selenization forms CIGS, which induces slower recombination of the excited carriers. Here, we provide direct evidence for the elongation of carrier lifetimes by incorporating Na into CIGS.

Abstract: Up-conversion (UC) is a promising approach to utilize sub-band-gap photons for solar cells (SCs). Due to the non-linear nature of UC, the optimal excitation power regimes between the solar cell semiconductor and the UC material correspond to a difference in solar concentration of more than an order of magnitude. This difference can be bridged with integrated optics by concentrating the photons transmitted through the solar cell to increase the power density and maximize the intensity of UC luminescence. To realize this, dielectric-filled compound parabolic concentrators (CPCs) were used as integrated optics on the rear side of a planar bifacial silicon solar cell together with a 25% Er3+ doped hexagonal sodium yttrium fluoride (β-NaYF4:Er) UC phosphor. An efficiency increase of 32% from 0.123% to 0.163% under sub-band-gap illumination is quantified by means of the first ever reported I–V characteristics for an up-conversion solar cell (UC-SC) based on c-Si. An enhancement in external quantum efficiency (EQE) is obtained from 1.33% for the non-concentrating reference UC-SC to 1.80% for a solar cell with integrated optics for an excitation at 1523nm with an irradiance of 0.024W/cm2, corresponding to a normalized EQE of 0.75W/cm2. This demonstrates that CPCs are suitable for UC-SC as they increase the concentration in the forwards direction, while maintaining high collection efficiency of the UC emission in the reverse direction. In addition, such an approach enables the optimization of the solar concentration on the UC phosphor independently from the concentration required for the solar cell.

Abstract: Building Integrated Concentrating Photovoltaics (BICPV) is a promising solution leading toward self-sustaining buildings. In this work, we have evaluated the performance of one such system carrying out detailed modeling and indoor experiments. The system has a geometric concentration of 6× and typically consists of a dielectric based Symmetric Elliptical Hyperboloid (SEH) concentrating element attached to a silicon solar cell. The incoming light incident on the top surface is concentrated and reaches the solar cell in a non-uniform fashion. Part of this concentrated light is converted to electricity and rest is dissipated in the form of heat. In order to analyze the performance of such a system, a coupled optical, electrical and thermal analysis is required. Using the non-uniform flux distribution obtained by the optical analysis, the electrical modeling of the solar cell is carried out at different incident angles. Modeling showed a maximum power ratio of 3.7 which is in line with the experimental values under a constant solar cell temperature. Several loss mechanisms occur in the system under actual operating conditions. Losses occurring due to the absorption of light over a range of spectrum were quantified by performing an External Quantum efficiency analysis. The losses occurring due to the solar cell temperature were evaluated while carrying out a coupled electrical and thermal analysis of the system. A maximum temperature of 319K was observed on the solar cell surface under normal incidence. An average drop of 11.7% was found making the effective power ratio of the system 3.4.

Abstract: Polygonal ZnO nanorods are synthesized with a hydrothermal technique and coated with an ultrathin CdS layer. A NiO cocatalyst layer is then deposited on the surface of the CdS coated ZnO and makes up a three-component nanostructured composite photoelectrode (NiO/CdS@ZnO). This composite photoelectrode shows an improved photoelectrochemical performance under Air Mass 1.5 (AM 1.5) simulated sunlight. It generates a photocurrent density of 950µA/cm2 with a comparatively low potential −0.6V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 0.5M Na2S and Na2SO3 solution, which is 6.78 times as much as that of the as-grown ZnO nanorods. Furthermore, it is also an efficient photoanode to split pure water, producing a photocurrent density of 530µA/cm2 at 0.5V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 1M Na2SO4 solution. In the composite, ZnO nanorods absorb UV light with a wide band gap, 3.2eV, while CdS, with a narrow band gap (2.4eV), utilizes the remaining visible light, furthermore, an ordered transfer of the charge carriers occurs in the component phases. The photoluminescence (PL) experiment results prove that the direct loading of NiO on ZnO results in an inactive material. However, both the CdS/ZnO and NiO/CdS@ZnO composites are active and the charge carrier separations in them are effectively improved than in the as-grown ZnO.

Abstract: Aging is a complex time-dependent biological process that takes place in every cell and organ, eventually leading to degenerative changes that affect normal biological functions. In the past decades, the number of older parents has increased significantly. While it is widely recognized that oocyte aging poses higher birth and reproductive risk, the exact molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. DNA methylation of 5-cytosine (5mC) and histone modifications are among the key epigenetic mechanisms involved in critical developmental processes and have been linked to aging. However, the impact of oocyte aging on DNA demethylation pathways has not been examined. The recent discovery of Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) family proteins, thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and the demethylation intermediates 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC has provided novel clues to delineate the molecular mechanisms in DNA demethylation. In this study, we examined the cellular level of modified cytosines (5mC, 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC) and Tet/Tdg expression in oocytes obtained from natural and accelerated oocyte aging conditions. Here we show all the DNA demethylation marks are dynamically regulated in both aging conditions, which are associated with Tet3 over-expression and Tdg repression. Such an aberrant expression pattern was more profound in accelerated aging condition. The results suggest that DNA demethylation may be actively involved in oocyte aging and have implications for development of potential drug targets to rejuvenate aging oocytes. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Epigenetics dynamics in development and disease.

Abstract: The importance of mitochondria for a typical aerobic eukaryotic cell is undeniable, as the list of necessary mitochondrial processes is steadily growing. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of mitochondrial biology of an early-branching parasitic protist, Trypanosoma brucei, a causative agent of serious human and cattle diseases. We present a comprehensive survey of its mitochondrial pathways including kinetoplast DNA replication and maintenance, gene expression, protein and metabolite import, major metabolic pathways, Fe-S cluster synthesis, ion homeostasis, organellar dynamics, and other processes. As we describe in this chapter, the single mitochondrion of T. brucei is everything but simple and as such rivals mitochondria of multicellular organisms.

Abstract: Complex I (CI) deficiency is the most common respiratory chain defect representing more than 30% of mitochondrial diseases. CI is an L-shaped multi-subunit complex with a peripheral arm protruding into the mitochondrial matrix and a membrane arm. CI sequentially assembled into main assembly intermediates: the P (pumping), Q (Quinone) and N (NADH dehydrogenase) modules. In this study, we analyzed 11 fibroblast cell lines derived from patients with inherited CI deficiency resulting from mutations in the nuclear or mitochondrial DNA and impacting these different modules. In patient cells carrying a mutation located in the matrix arm of CI, blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) revealed a significant reduction of fully assembled CI enzyme and an accumulation of intermediates of the N module. In these cell lines with an assembly defect, NADH dehydrogenase activity was partly functional, even though CI was not fully assembled. We further demonstrated that this functional N module was responsible for ROS production through the reduced flavin mononucleotide. Due to the assembly defect, the FMN site was not re-oxidized leading to a significant oxidative stress in cell lines with an assembly defect. These findings not only highlight the relationship between CI assembly and oxidative stress, but also show the suitability of BN-PAGE analysis in evaluating the consequences of CI dysfunction. Moreover, these data suggest that the use of antioxidants may be particularly relevant for patients displaying a CI assembly defect.

Abstract: A heterostructured cathode having a graded bandgap window-layer is proposed in this study to improve the performance of photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) solar energy converters. A model based on a one-dimensional steady-state equation is developed to analyze the characteristics of the proposed device. This model is used to calculate the conversion efficiency of a PETE device with an AlxGa1−xAs/GaAs cathode. The built-in electric field induced by the bandgap gradation in the window-layer is shown to improve the efficiency because of the reduction of contact surface recombination losses and efficient collection of photogenerated electrons. This field is unaffected by temperature variation, and the improvement of efficiency is sustained at elevated temperatures. The effect of window-layer parameters and cathode thickness on efficiency is discussed. We also show that the efficiency maximizes at lower temperatures for cathodes with lower electron affinities. Moreover an optimal value exists for anode work function at a given anode temperature, thus providing guidance for the optimum design of barrier conditions for both cathode and anode.

Abstract: Complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21) plays an important role in the generation of normal B cell immune responses. As transcription appears to be the prime mechanism via which surface CR2/CD21 expression is controlled, understanding transcriptional regulation of this gene will have broader implications to B cell biology. Here we report opposing, cell-context specific control of CR2/CD21 promoter activity by tandem E-box elements, spaced 22bp apart and within 70bp of the transcription initiation site. We have identified E2A and USF transcription factors as binding to the distal and proximal E-box sites respectively in CR2-positive B-cells, at a site that is hypersensitive to restriction enzyme digestion compared to non-expressing K562 cells. However, additional unidentified proteins have also been found to bind these functionally important elements. By utilizing a proteomics approach we have identified a repressor protein, RP58, binding the distal E-box motif. Co-transfection experiments using RP58 overexpression constructs demonstrated a specific 10-fold repression of CR2/CD21 transcriptional activity mediated through the distal E-box repressor element. Taken together, our results indicate that repression of the CR2/CD21 promoter can occur through one of the E-box motifs via recruitment of RP58 and other factors to bring about a silenced chromatin context within CR2/CD21 non-expressing cells.

Abstract: MiR-139-5p down-regulation has frequently been implicated in colorectal carcinoma. However, there is little known about its biological function between inflammation and cancer in vivo. Here, a transgenic murine model of colorectal carcinoma was used to investigate pathogenetic role of miR-139-5p in colitis and colitis-associated tumorigenesis. We showed that miR-139-5p knockout mice were higher sensitive to DSS-induced colitis and enhanced formation of intestinal neoplasia was observed when mice were exposed to AOM/DSS treatment. MiR-139-5p knockout mice exhibited an increased expression of genes involved in Wnt pathway. Such genes are closely associated with cell proliferation and differentiation, promoting the β-catenin nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, biochemical studies in HCT-116 cells revealed that the over-expression of miR-139-5p inhibited the crosstalk between PI3K/AKT and Wnt pathway mediated by IGF-1R. Collectively, these findings indicate that miR-139-5p plays a crucial role in the development and progression of colitis-associated tumorigenesis and suggest that miR-139-5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colitis-associated cancer in the future.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an attractive target for cancer therapy due to its ability to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells, without causing significant toxicity in normal tissues. We previously reported that galactoxyloglucan (PST001) possesses significant antitumor and immunomodulatory properties. However, the exact mechanism in mediating this anticancer effect is unknown. This study, for the first time, indicated that PST001 sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer (A549) and nasopharyngeal (KB) cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In vitro studies suggested that PST001 induced apoptosis primarily via death receptors and predominantly activated caspases belonging to the extrinsic apoptotic cascade. Microarray profiling of PST001 treated A549 and KB cells showed the suppression of survivin (BIRC5) and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, as well as increased cytochrome C. TaqMan low density array analysis of A549 cells also confirmed that the induction of apoptosis by the polysaccharide occurred through the TRAIL-DR4/DR5 pathways. This was finally confirmed by in silico analysis, which revealed that PST001 binds to TRAIL-DR4/DR5 complexes more strongly than TNF and Fas ligand–receptor complexes. In summary, our results suggest the potential of PST001 to be developed as an anticancer agent that not only preserves innate biological activity of TRAIL, but also sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Abstract: In this work we present a transparent conductive oxide (TCO)-free flexible perovskite planar heterojunction solar cell made with a semitransparent anode realized with a highly conductive poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS (PH1000 by Clevios) modified with ethylene glycol layer, deposited via spray coating. We investigated several formulations of PEDOT:PSS modified by addition of solvents with high boiling point such as ethylene glycol (EG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Optimized samples show a 65% transmittance at 550nm and a sheet resistance of 28Ω/□. On these optimized electrodes we fabricated a TCO-free flexible device, the best of which exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 4.9% under 100mW/cm2 illumination at AM1.5G. The efficiency of the perovskite planar-heterojunction solar cell, with the modified PEDOT:PSS anode was comparable to the one realized on a PET–ITO anode. Moreover, in the bending test, ITO-free flexible solar cell manifested superior mechanical robustness, showing the high flexibility of the perovskite layer.

Abstract: Antireflection coatings have received a great importance due to their ability to enhance the efficiency of the solar cells and solar selective coatings by minimizing the reflections of the incident light from the front surface. In this study, a silica (SiO2) sol, prepared using sol–gel process, was deposited on cleaned glass substrates by dip coating method and subjected to heat treatment at 400°C. The thickness and porosity of the coating were optimized to achieve high transmittance. The thickness was optimized by varying the lifting speed of the substrate from the sol. The porosity was induced in the coating by using polymeric additives and through heat treatments. The optimized single layer SiO2 coating on cleaned glass substrate exhibited a maximum transmittance of 97.5% at λ=500nm wavelength. The hybrid sol was found to give reproducible coatings up to a period of 30 days when stored at 16°C. The present process provides a simple and cost effective method for the preparation of antireflection coatings, which have huge potential to enhance the efficiency of solar cells, receiver tubes and other solar devices.

Abstract: Anion-controlled chemistry in ZnO films is essential to obtain stable charge–carrier transport and to prevent degradation in the performance of the transparent contact layer in solar cells through passivation of O-related defects by F substitution. Therefore, in this work, the passivation effect of F doping in ZnO was confirmed by analysis for the chemical state of O in ZnO films using XPS surface analysis in the O 1s region. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of F doping in a ZnO matrix on the electronic structure of the resulting films as a function of electron concentration by optical band gap shift (Burstein–Moss theory) and near-band-edge transition (photoluminescence with Stokes shift theory) measurements in ZnO films with different F doping concentrations. The band gap narrowing effect was not significant in the F-doped ZnO films due to valence band perturbation from anion doping rather than conduction band perturbation. Finally, the band structure could be approximated by the relationship between experimental analysis and the formation of valence and conduction bands in ZnO orbitals.

Abstract: Sub-grain boundaries related to dislocation clusters are seriously detrimental to the quality of mono-like cast silicon, which reduce the efficiency of the solar cells. Here, we have developed a novel technique to grow the mono-like cast silicon by forming special grain boundaries. The special grain boundaries are induced by controlling the placing method of seeds at the bottom of crucible. It is found that the sub-grain boundaries in the new ingots are completely suppressed, which are clarified by the measurements of photoluminescence and electroluminescence. Therefore, compared to the conventional mono-like ingot, the minority carrier lifetime of the new ingots is significantly increased, and the internal quantum efficiency of corresponding solar cells gets obviously improved. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cells is averagely 18.1%, which is much higher than that of conventional ones by a value of 0.6% absolutely. These results are of significance for the quality improvement of mono-like silicon and their application in photovoltaics.

Abstract: Acidic solution texture by HF/HNO3 has been wildly used for the multicrystalline-Si (mc-Si) solar cell mass production. But, acidic texturing is difficult for the diamond wire sawn wafer, because the damage layer does not homogeneously distribute on the diamond wire sawn wafer. Metal catalyst texture (MCT) using silver nitrate (AgNO3) is effective method even though the diamond wire sawn wafer. The texture with metal catalyst reaction is spontaneously formed irrespective of the wafer surface condition. In this article, fine texture structure is demonstrated for the diamond wire sawn wafer by the MCT method, texture structure is possible to control easily by changing the immersion time in the reaction container. The cell conversion efficiency for the diamond wire sawn wafer by the MCT is as high as that for the slurry wire sawn wafer by the acidic texture. The MCT is effective method for both the slurry and diamond wire sawn wafer. The MCT method will especially become most possible alternative candidate for the diamond wire sawn wafer.

Abstract: The results of a study on the effects of encapsulant pre-conditioning (drying) on the durability of “conventional” and “inverted” bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells based on P3HT:PCBM are presented. The architectures of the conventional and inverted devices were ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al and ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag, respectively. Quantitative analysis of the moisture content, moisture out-gassing, and re-absorbing properties of flexible barrier encapsulant films under ambient conditions was conducted. The effect of moisture out-gassing from the encapsulation materials on device performance was studied and the lifetime of conventional and inverted devices was found to decline significantly for the devices encapsulated using materials without pre-conditioning. This study reveals the essential role of pre-conditioning of materials in the encapsulation of organic photovoltaic devices. Current-voltage characteristics exhibit a clear increase in the series resistance of the devices during storage under ambient conditions, and Spectroscopic Impedance analysis indicates that charge-transport resistance within the devices increases significantly during the degradation process. The results are consistent with the primary degradation mechanism being corrosion at the metal-electrode surface.

Abstract: This article studies new binary eutectic mixtures of sugar alcohols for their use as phase change materials (PCMs) in the 50–90°C temperature range. This range is suitable for domestic solar thermal systems and cogeneration devices. The mixtures studied were composed of erythritol and xylitol, erythritol and sorbitol, and xylitol and sorbitol. Their phase diagrams were experimentally established by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. Polarized thermomicroscopy was employed to determine the crystallization rate of the pure materials and eutectic compositions. Additionally, the polymorphic behavior of the pure materials was assessed and compared with data from the literature. The results showed that, with respect to thermal properties and economic aspects, the eutectic compositions found are suitable for the intended purpose. Unfortunately, their crystallization rates are noticeably low, which limits their use as PCMs. A modeling approach based on thermodynamics was used to predict solid–liquid equilibria of the studied mixtures and their melting enthalpies. The simulated results were in good agreement with experimental results. The modeled and experimental results were finally used to highlight a few practical aspects relevant for the development of new eutectic mixture-based PCMs.

Abstract: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a multifunctional protein with diverse biological functions in human cells. In bacteria, moonlighting GAPDH functions have only been described for the secreted protein in pathogens or probiotics. At the intracellular level, we previously reported the interaction of Escherichia coli GAPDH with phosphoglycolate phosphatase, a protein involved in the metabolism of the DNA repair product 2-phosphoglycolate, thus suggesting a putative role of GAPDH in DNA repair processes. Here, we provide evidence that GAPDH is required for the efficient repair of DNA lesions in E. coli. We show that GAPDH-deficient cells are more sensitive to bleomycin or methyl methanesulfonate. In cells challenged with these genotoxic agents, GAPDH deficiency results in reduced cell viability and filamentous growth. In addition, the gapA knockout mutant accumulates a higher number of spontaneous abasic sites and displays higher spontaneous mutation frequencies than the parental strain. Pull-down experiments in different genetic backgrounds show interaction between GAPDH and enzymes of the base excision repair pathway, namely the AP-endonuclease Endo IV and uracil DNA glycosylase. This finding suggests that GAPDH is a component of a protein complex dedicated to the maintenance of genomic DNA integrity. Our results also show interaction of GAPDH with the single-stranded DNA binding protein. This interaction may recruit GAPDH to the repair sites and implicates GAPDH in DNA repair pathways activated by profuse DNA damage, such as homologous recombination or the SOS response.

Abstract: The Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is an essential cellular protein that is involved in cell–cell adhesion, protein trafficking, and viral infection. The major isoform of CAR is selectively sorted to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells where it co-localizes with the cellular scaffolding protein membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted domain structure-1 (MAGI-1). Previously, we demonstrated CAR interacts with MAGI-1 through a PDZ–domain dependent interaction. Here, we show that the PDZ3 domain of MAGI-1 is exclusively responsible for the high affinity interaction between the seven exon isoform of CAR and MAGI-1 using yeast-two-hybrid analysis and confirming this interaction biochemically and in cellular lysates by in vitro pull down assay and co-immunoprecipitation. The high affinity interaction between the PDZ3 domain and CAR C-terminus was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Further, we investigated the biological relevance of this high affinity interaction between CAR and the PDZ3 domain of MAGI-1 and found that it does not alter CAR-mediated adenovirus infection. By contrast, interruption of this high affinity interaction altered the localization of MAGI-1 indicating that CAR is able to traffic MAGI-1 to cell junctions. These data deepen the molecular understanding of the interaction between CAR and MAGI-1 and indicate that although CAR plays a role in trafficking PDZ-based scaffolding proteins to cellular junctions, association with a high affinity intracellular binding partner does not significantly alter adenovirus binding and entry via CAR.

Abstract: The treatment of hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon oxide (i-a-SiOx:H) films by H2 plasma is found through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to significantly improve the quality of the layers, which is attributed to variation in the Si–Hn bonding structure and an improvement of bonding order. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicate that the initial growth of a hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) layer deposited on a treated i-a-SiOx:H film is also improved, which is beneficial to the performance of solar cells deposited on highly textured front electrodes. By inserting an i-a-SiOx:H film that is optimized in terms of H2 plasma treatment time as a p/i buffer layer in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cell, a significant increase in fill factor and open-circuit voltage are also observed. In this way, a high initial conversion efficiency of 11.3% can be achieved in a single-junction a-Si:H solar cell with an active layer thickness of 300nm.

Abstract: Concentrating solar power is becoming an increasingly important part of the renewable energy portfolio. However, further cost reduction is desired to make CSP competitive with traditional energy technologies. Higher operating temperature is considered an attractive avenue leading to higher power conversion efficiency and lower cost, but tremendous technical challenges exist with higher temperature operation of CSP, with one of the main issues being the lack of a high-performance solar absorbing material that is durable at 750°C or above. In this work, a black oxide material, made of cobalt oxide nanoparticles, is synthesized and utilized as a high-temperature solar absorbing material. The nanoparticles are embedded in a dielectric matrix through a scalable spray coating process. The top layer of the coating is further improved with light-trapping structures using sacrificial fillers introduced from the same coating process. After the surface modification of cobalt oxide coating, we achieved a high thermal efficiency of 88.2%. More importantly, the coating shows no degradation after 1000-h annealing at 750°C in air, while the existing commercial light absorbing coating was reported to degrade by long-term exposure at high temperature. Our findings suggest that the materials and processes developed here are promising for solar absorbing coating for future high-temperature CSP systems.

Abstract: Tropomyosin is a major regulatory protein of contractile systems and cytoskeleton, an actin-binding protein that positions laterally along actin filaments and modulates actin–myosin interaction. About 40 tropomyosin isoforms have been found in a variety of cytoskeleton systems, not necessarily connected with actin–myosin interaction and contraction. Involvement of specific tropomyosin isoforms in the regulation of key cell processes was shown, and specific features of tropomyosin genes and protein structure have been investigated with molecular biology and genetics approaches. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of tropomyosin on cytoskeleton dynamics are still unclear. As tropomyosin is primarily an F-actin-binding protein, it is important to understand how it interacts both with actin and actin-binding proteins functioning in muscles and cytoskeleton to regulate actin dynamics. This review focuses on biochemical data on the effects of tropomyosin on actin assembly and dynamics, as well as on the modulation of these effects by actin-binding proteins. The data indicate that tropomyosin can efficiently regulate actin dynamics via allosteric conformational changes within actin filaments.

Abstract: The immune system is based on the actions of the collection of specialized immune defense cells and their secreted proteins and peptides that defend the host against infection by parasites. Parasites are organisms that live part or all of their lives in close physical association with the host and extract nutrients from the host and, by releasing toxins and virulence factors, cause disease with the potential for injury and premature death of that host. Parasites of the metazoa can be viruses, eubacteria, fungi, protozoans, and other metazoans. The immune system operates to kill or eliminate parasites and eliminate or detoxify their toxins and virulence factors. Although some of the elements of immune systems are specific to a particular phylum of metazoans, others show extensive evolutionary conservation, being present in several or all major phyla of the metazoa. The pentraxins display this latter character in their roles in immune defense. Pentraxins have been documented in vertebrates, nonvertebrate chordates, arthropods, and mollusks and may be present in other taxa of metazoans. Presumably the pentraxins appeared early in the evolution of metazoa, prior to their evolutionary divergence in the Precambrian epoch into many phyla present today, and have been preserved for the 542 million years since that explosive evolutionary radiation. The fidelity with which these phyla have preserved the pentraxins suggests that the functions of these proteins are important for survival of the members of these diverse taxa of animals.

Abstract: We investigated four hot carrier (HC) absorber material candidates InN, BSb, InP and AlSb for HC solar cells. Their potential of making good absorbers was estimated based on available experimental data from literature and theoretical results from high accuracy density functional theory calculations. For a comprehensive assessment of HC thermalization, we developed a new method to quantify HC cooling powers in these materials. Contrary to common belief, our results show that a minimum optical frequency higher than twice the maximum acoustical frequency is not vital for HC absorber materials. For materials with highly polar bonds, Ridley decay triggers significant thermalization, compromising the usefulness of certain HC absorber candidates such as InN.

Abstract: In this work the potential of thin manganese oxide layers deposited by physical vapor deposition at moderate vacuum pressure to significantly retard the corrosion of silicon photo-anodes during the oxidation of water is reported. Results show that manganese oxide layers up to 10nm thick display sufficient transmission of solar frequency radiation and electrical conductivity to facilitate efficient oxidation of water by the underlying silicon while offering complete protection from oxidation of the silicon substrate for more than 14h. Data from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that the increased lifetime observed when using manganese oxide as a protective layer is a result of the inhibition of the growth of silicon oxide during the reaction.

The smooth surface which can be altered to have “hill like” structures by addition of NiOx doping in the PEDOT:PSS indicates the formation of insulating film of PSS. Such PSS insulating layer may have similar advantages to the LiF insulating barrier used in organic electronics. The addition of NiOx crystallites, produced insulating films of PSS of thickness varying from 3.35 to 7.17nm. The production of these layers could be the explanation for the excellent stability of inverted OPVs with a PEDOT:PSS:NiOX interlayer as used in our study.

Abstract: We present a new dandelion-like TiO2 spheres by a modified hydrothermal method for manufacture of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This construct is composed of numerous nanowires for employment as the scattering layer of DSSCs. Such morphology is produced by nucleation-growth-assembly mechanism. The size of the dandelion-like spheres and their morphology can be tailored by controlling the processing parameters of the modified hydrothermal process. TiO2 nanoparticles with narrow size distribution are also synthesized by hydrothermal route for the active layer of DSSCs. The nanoparticles show pure anatase phase with average size of 40nm, whereas the dandelion-like TiO2 spheres are pure rutile structure with average diameter in the range 5–9μm. A systematic study is performed in order to improve the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with different arrangement modes. First, the monolayer DSSCs with various thicknesses are prepared using pure nanoparticles. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.4% is obtained for the monolayer cell with thickness of 31μm. Second, the double layer DSSCs containing an under-layer and an over-layer are reported. The double layer DSSC made of nanoparticles as the under-layer (with thickness around 31μm) and mixtures of nanoparticles and dandelion-like spheres as the over-layer (as light scattering layer with thickness around 8μm) shows the highest PCE of 8.3%. The improvement of cell efficiency is explained by triple function mechanism including significant increase in light scattering, dye sensitization and photo-generated charge carriers.

Abstract: A previously published fluorene based interlayer polymer is here compared to three similar polymers where the fluorene monomer has been exchanged with monomers that have been reported to have a higher photo-chemical stability. The polymer interlayers have been studied in terms of their influence on device performance and stability on inverted devices with an active layer of P3HT:PC61BM. By acting as a hole-blocking layer the polymers are able to increase the efficiency of the devices with ~50% compared to devices with an ITO cathode. In addition, the polymers also improve the photo-stability of the devices, mainly as an effect of a reduced decrease in open-circuit voltage and fill factor. This indicates that solution processable polymer interlayers could be a way towards both higher efficiency and improved stability of inverted organic solar cells.

Abstract: Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are an emerging approach to reduce installation costs while supplementing building energy needs. However, the physical constraints of the building architecture often prevent photovoltaic systems from being installed at their optimal orientation. Recently, it was shown that thin film photovoltaics can be designed for improved angle-dependent responsivity at specific angles. In this study, the complex impact of angular dependency on overall power output is explored based on detailed hourly solar position, location, and flux data. These results demonstrate that reducing the angular roll-off dependence can enhance overall power outputs by 30% or more in fixed orientation configurations depending on the geographical location, orientation, and angle-dependent roll-off characteristics.

Abstract: Angiogenin (ANG), a member of the secreted ribonuclease family, is a potent angiogenesis stimulator that interacts with endothelial cells inducing a wide range of responses. Metal ions dyshomeostasis play a fundamental role in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular copper that is also involved in angiogenesis processes. It is known that vascular pathologies are present in neurodegenerative diseases and Angiogenin is down-regulated in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, as well as it has been found as one of the mutated genes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Copper (II) induces an increase of Angiogenin binding to endothelial cells but, so far, the relationship between copper-ANG and angiogenesis induction remain unclear. Herein, the effects of copper (II) ions on Angiogenin activity and expression were evaluated. The binding of copper was demonstrated to affect the intracellular localization of the protein decreasing its nuclear translocation. Moreover, the ANG-copper (II) system negatively affects the protein-induced angiogenesis, as well as endothelial cells migration. Surprisingly, copper also reveals the ability to modulate the Angiogenin transcription. These results highlight the tight relationship between copper and Angiogenin, pointing out the biological relevance of ANG-copper system in the regulation of endothelial cell function, and revealing a possible new mechanism at the basis of vascular pathologies.

Abstract: Silver-modified TiO2 microspheres (SMTMs) have been synthesized via a novel in-situ Ag-loading method in which tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) is hydrolyzed in a mixed solution of ethanol and AgNO3. The structures, compositions and optical properties of the as-prepared products were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, EDX, XPS, FESEM, HRTEM and UV–vis diffuse reflectance techniques, and the photocatalytic properties of the product was estimated for the photodegradation of rhodamine B (Rh B) under visible light irradiation. The photo-response of the as-obtained SMTMs is greatly shifted into the visible light spectrum, and exhibits a band gap narrowing compared with that of pure TiO2 microspheres (PT). The photocatalytic tests of SMTMs reveal a much higher photocurrent and photocatalytic activity than that of other composites and PT. However, the photocatalytic activities of SMTMs in aqueous suspension depend on the Ag-loading process. The product synthesized by using, for example, an in-situ Ag-loading process not only showed an enhanced visible light-driven photocatalytic activity, but also displayed good photocatalytic stability.

Abstract: Considerable research supports a model in which hydrolytic enzymes of mammalian lysosomes are sorted to their destinations in a receptor-dependent mechanism. The ligand for the mammalian sorting receptors is mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). Two M6P receptors have been defined in mammals. Here, we review the foundational evidence supporting this mechanism and highlight the remaining gaps in our understanding of the mammalian mechanism, including evidence for M6P-independent sorting, and its relevance to lysosomal enzyme sorting in metazoa.

Abstract: Protein kinase CK2 plays an essential role in cell viability in lower and higher eukaryotes. As a global regulator it phosphorylates and thereby regulates a broad array of cellular targets including a large number of transcription factors. Here, we have identified the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) as a new substrate for CK2. Using point mutants of C/EBPδ the major phosphorylation site for CK2 was mapped to serine 57, which is located within the transactivation domain of C/EBPδ. For proper functioning as a transcription factor C/EBPδ has to be translocated into the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with other members of the C/EBP family of proteins and ATF4. Here, we found that CK2 phosphorylation does neither influence the subcellular localization of C/EBPδ nor its interaction with C/EBPβ, but rather does CK2 phosphorylation modulate the transcriptional activity of C/EBPδ. Moreover, we found that CK2 bound to C/EBPδ, which might help to target CK2 to the transcriptional machinery where it can phosphorylate other transcription factors or co-activators.

Abstract: Raman scattering and atomic force microscopy measurements on Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films prepared by a direct solution method revealed that metal sulfates of various morphologies (dense clusters or separated particles) were partially embedded on the surface of the Cu2ZnSnS4 layer. This residue was removed during the subsequent chemical bath deposition of the CdS buffer layer. However, the removal of the residue led to poor crystallinity and reduced photocurrent near the location of the residue, which suggests that controlling the formation of the sulfates during the fabrication of the absorber layer would be critical for obtaining high efficiency solar cells by the solution method.

Abstract: The corrosive effects of a molten nitrate mixture of 48% Ca(NO3)2+7% NaNO3+45% KNO3 were appraised at 390°C on two different types of stainless steels (AISI 304, 430), a low-Cr alloy steel (T22) and a carbon steel (A1). The corrosion rates were determined using gravimetric tests, which measured the weight gain during 2000h to identify the corrosion products with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Studies on stainless steel revealed a better behaviour in corrosive environment, which mainly identifies the formation of (K,Na)CrO4 protective spinel. Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 were the other important products that were found in the tests performed at 390°C; the formation of some stable compounds with salt impurities, such as carbonates and sulphates, was also observed.

Abstract: NIR irradiation accounts for 52% of the solar irradiance energy reaching the earth, most of which is transferred to thermal energy. This work was undertaken in order to investigate the possibility of applying NIR reflective coatings on cotton fabric with the purpose of surface temperature reduction when irradiated with solar light. Commercial titania was modified by means of calcination treatments. Phase transition from anatase to rutile and growth in particle size were induced, and both processes resulted in an increase of NIR reflectance of the calcined TiO2. Irregular-shaped TiO2 particles with sizes of 293–618nm were obtained. The highest solar reflectance occurred in the TiO2 sample with an anatase:rutile ratio of 35:65 and a particle diameter of 563nm. By applying the NIR reflective coating consisting of calcined TiO2 on cotton fabric, a lower surface temperature was recorded with a maximum difference of 3.9°C. It was found that a chitosan-TiO2 coating could provide a better wash fastness than TiO2 alone.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins, many of which function as molecular chaperones, play important roles in the lifecycle and pathogenesis of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The P. falciparum heat shock protein 70 (PfHsp70) family of chaperones is potentially regulated by a large complement of J proteins that localize to various intracellular compartments including the infected erythrocyte cytosol. While PfHsp70-1 has been shown to be an abundant cytosolic chaperone, its regulation by J proteins is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the J protein PFB0595w, a homologue of the well-studied yeast cytosolic J protein, Sis1. PFB0595w, similarly to PfHsp70-1, was localized to the parasite cytosol and its expression was upregulated by heat shock. Additionally, recombinant PFB0595w was shown to be dimeric and to stimulate the in vitro ATPase activity of PfHsp70-1. Overall, the expression, localization and biochemical data for PFB0595w suggest that it may function as a cochaperone of PfHsp70-1, and advances current knowledge on the chaperone machinery of the parasite.

Abstract: The present paper demonstrates the possibility of replacing indium–tin oxide (ITO) with heavily boron-doped diamond (BDD). Plasma Enhanced Chemically Vapor Deposited BDDs layers of various thicknesses were prepared containing various boron concentrations in a gas phase. The dependence of the above-mentioned parameters on the optical and electrical properties of each BDD was studied in order to achieve optimal conditions for the effective application of diamond electrodes in organic electronics as a replacement for ITO. Bulk-heterojunction polymer–fullerene organic solar cells were fabricated to test the potency of BDD application in photovoltaic devices. The obtained results demonstrated the possibility of the aforementioned application. Even though the efficiency of BDD-based devices is lower compared to those using regular ITO-based architecture, the relevant issues were explained.

Abstract: Direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion via water splitting was demonstrated in an integrated photovoltaic–electrochemical (PV–EC) device using a hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin film tandem junction (a-Si:H/a-Si:H) solar cell as photocathode. The solar cell was adapted to provide sufficient photovoltage to drive both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The best results, in terms of photoelectrochemical stability and performance, were obtained with an Ag/Pt layer stack as H2 evolving photocathode back contact and with a RuO2 counter electrode for O2 evolution. Under irradiation by simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 spectrum with 100mW/cm2), we achieved 6.8% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency at 0V applied bias in a two-electrode set-up. This sets a fresh benchmark for integrated thin film silicon tandem based photoelectrochemical devices. In addition, the photovoltage at constant current (−3mA/cm2) was measured over a prolonged period of time and revealed an excellent chemical stability (operation over 50h) of the photocathode. Furthermore, we present an empirical serial circuit model of the PV–EC device, in which the corresponding photovoltaic and electrochemical components are decoupled. This allows for a detailed comparison between the solar cell and the PV–EC cell characteristics, from which the relevant loss processes in the overall system could be identified. The model was further used to compare calculated and measured photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the investigated PV–EC device which showed excellent agreement.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are the effective substances for thermal energy storage. Unfortunately, various problems such as high supercooling degree, low crystal growth rate and poor thermal conductivity greatly hinder the large-scale utilization of PCMs. The present study focuses on improving the crystallization and decreasing supercooling degree by adding various proportions of NaCl/NaCl solutions into the n-octadecane-based PCMs for thermal energy storage. The experimental results show that 20wt% NaCl solutions have the greatest effect on the thermal performance of PCMs. The supercooling degree has been minimized up to 6°C with the addition of NaCl. It can not only promote crystallization under 1wt% addition rate, but also enhance latent heat storage performance. Such observations have been verified by the kinetics of crystallization. The researches on supercooling could advance the application of PCMs on solar energy.

Abstract: We report the application of thin film nanocrystalline (NC) FeS2 as the copper-free back contact for CdTe solar cells. The FeS2-NC layer is prepared from solution directly on the CdTe surface using drop-casting coupled with a hydrazine treatment at ambient temperature and pressure, and requires no thermal treatment. Copper-free solar cells based on the CdS/CdTe/FeS2-NC/Au architecture exhibit device efficiencies >90% that of a standard Cu/Au back contact devices. The FeS2-NC back contact solar cells show good thermal stability under initial tests. Devices prepared with untreated FeS2-NC back contacts display a strong “S-kink” behavior which we correlate with a high hole-transport barrier arising from inter-NC organic surfactant molecules.

Abstract: Low thermal emittance is the key factor of a solar collector. For high temperature solar thermal applications, low emittance is an important parameter, because the thermal radiative losses of the absorbers increase proportionally by T4. Our primary motivation for carrying out this work has been to lower the thermal emittance of stainless steel substrate (intrinsic emittance=0.12–0.13) by coating a thin film of high infrared (IR) reflecting tungsten (W). Tungsten thin films were deposited on stainless steel substrates using a glow discharge direct current magnetron sputtering system. Emittance as low as 0.03 was obtained by varying the thickness of W coating on stainless steel substrate. The influences of structural, morphological and electrical properties of the W coating on its emittance values are studied. The effect of substrate roughness on the emittance of W coating is also examined. Thermal stability of the W coatings is studied in both vacuum and air. In order to demonstrate the effect of W interlayer, solar selective coating of AlTiN/AlTiON/AlTiO tandem absorber was deposited on W coated stainless steel substrates, which exhibited absorptance of 0.955 and emittance of 0.08 with a thermal stability up to 600°C in vacuum.

Abstract: The traditional microencapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) only have a single function of thermal energy storage. In this study, we designed and synthesized a new type of PCMs-based microcapsules containing an n-eicosane core and ZrO2 shell with the dual-functional characteristics of latent-heat storage/release and photoluminescence. The chemical structures and compositions of the resultant microcapsules were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. These microcapsules exhibited a spherical morphology with a uniform size distribution and well-defined core–shell structure according to the observation of scanning and transmission electronic microscopy. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed that only the amorphous ZrO2 shell was formed in the sol–gel process. However, the F− ions could induce the phase transition from the amorphous ZrO2 shell to the crystalline one consisting of monoclinic and tetragonal phases. The photoluminescence characterization indicated that the microcapsules with the crystalline ZrO2 shell could generate the purple-colored and green-colored luminescence after excited by UV radiation at a wavelength of 296nm, whereas only the green-colored luminescence was recorded after excitation toward the microcapsules with the amorphous shell. Most of all, the dual-functional microcapsules revealed good phase-change properties, and meanwhile, they achieved a high thermal-storage capability, high thermal reliability, and good thermal stability as a result of encapsulation of the compact ZrO2 shell. The dual-functional microcapsules developed by this work show potential applications for intelligent fibers or textiles, electronic devices, thermosensitive and photosensitive sensors, information-storage units, etc.

Abstract: In this paper, calcium nitrate and sodium nitrate are mixed in different molar ratios to form a cheap phase change material. The result shows that these binary mixtures all have exothermic peaks at around 220°C, and the observed enthalpy increases with the NaNO3 ratio. Further study indicates that although Ca(NO3)2 and NaNO3 are mixed in different proportions, the mixture always first melts in the eutectic composition. Different Ca(NO3)2 and NaNO3 ratio will lead to different amount of eutectic production, thereby resulting in different observed enthalpy. The sample with Ca(NO3)2 and NaNO3 molar ratio of 3:7 shows the best heat storage performance. Specific heat capacity, compatibility and thermal conductivity are also measured in the paper. The cost of the 3:7 mixture is only about half of solar salt, but they have a similar latent heat storage capacity. Overall, this mixture shows a good application advantage.

The multilayer of the FZTO (40nm)/Ag (9nm)/FZTO (40nm) electrode shows the maximum optical transmittance (λ=380–770nm) of 88.15%, quite low electrical resistivity of ~8×10−5Ω cm and the corresponding figure of merit (T10/Rsq) is equivalent to 3.46×10−2Ω−1. A normal organic photovoltaic׳s (OPV) structure of poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2 ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl] (PTB7): phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) was fabricated on glass/FZTO/Ag/FZTO to examine the compatibility of OPV as a transparent conducting electrode. The bulk hetero-junction organic photovoltaic׳s device fabricated on the multilayer FAF electrode exhibited open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.72V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 12.28mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.54. These properties are analogous to Voc=0.75V, Jsc=14.87mA/cm2, FF=0.53 on commercial indium tin oxide (ITO). A resultant power conversion efficiency of 4.84% is comparable with the 5.90% of the same OPV structure on the commercial ITO as a reference. This reveals that FZTO/Ag/FZTO multilayer electrode is a promising electrode scheme for bulk hetero-junction organic photovoltaic׳s cells (BHJ-OPVs).

Abstract: The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) is a plasma membrane-associated protein that is highly expressed in human acute myeloid leukaemia cells. As an acute myeloid leukaemia antigen, it could therefore be considered as a potential target for immune therapy and highly-specific drug delivery. However, a conceptual understanding of its biological role is required before consideration of this protein for therapeutic settings. Here, we reveal the detailed mechanism of action underlying the biological responses mediated by the Tim-3 receptor in myeloid cells. Our studies demonstrate that Tim-3 triggers growth factor type responses in acute myeloid leukaemia cells by activating a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. In addition, the receptor activates hypoxic signalling pathways upregulating glycolysis and pro-angiogenic responses. These findings suggest that Tim-3 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for immune therapy and drug delivery in human acute myeloid leukaemia cells.

Abstract: Historically, spectral analysis of internal quantum efficiency has played an important role in solar cell characterization. The applicability of this technique is reassessed in view of developments over recent years as a means of determining cell optical and electrical properties. The refined technique, applicable to both conventional and front surface field devices, highlights three distinct spectral regions, allowing additional front surface investigation by blue response analysis and more simplified analysis over a weakly absorbed region where photo-generation is uniform throughout the absorber and parasitic absorption remains sufficiently constant at these wavelengths. The approach is demonstrated by application to a modern front surface field device as a complement to previous work.

Abstract: The use of thin-film copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) and cadmium-telluride (CdTe) in solar technologies has grown rapidly in recent years, leading to an increased demand for gallium, indium, and tellurium. In the coming years, recycling these elements from end-of-life photovoltaic (PV) modules may be an important part of their overall supply, but little is known about the economic feasibility and the potential quantities available. This article investigates the future role of PV recycling in supplying gallium, indium, and tellurium. The authors evaluate both the quantities available from recycling over the next century and the associated costs for recycling modules and reusing each element in PV manufacturing. The findings indicate that, in terms of technical potential, there may be significant quantities of each element available from recycling CIGS and CdTe modules. The estimated cost of recovering each element from end-of-life PV modules and reusing it in PV manufacturing is higher than current raw mineral costs; however, learning and economies of scale may reduce the reported early estimates of recycling costs. These findings help improve the understanding of recycling's role in enabling higher levels of CIGS and CdTe module production.

Abstract: The hot carrier cell aims to extract the electrical energy from photo-generated carriers before they thermalise to the band edges. Hence it can potentially achieve a high current and a high voltage and hence very high efficiencies up to 66% for unconcentrated sunlight and 85% under maximum concentration. To slow the rate of carrier thermalisation is very challenging, but modification of the phonon energies and the use of nanostructures are both promising ways to achieve some of the required slowing of carrier cooling. Required absorber material properties have been identified, relating to phononic and electronic properties as well as to practical considerations. Candidate materials evaluated in terms of these prerequisites include large mass anion, transition metal nitrides, Group IV compounds and nanostructures. Promising candidate materials include InN, HfN and SnSi. Initial measurements indicate slowed carrier cooling in III–Vs with large phonon band gaps in multiple quantum wells. It is expected that soon proof of concept of hot carrier devices will pave the way for their development to fully functioning high efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: A new nanostructured TiAlC/TiAlCN/TiAlSiCN/TiAlSiCO/TiAlSiO tandem absorber has been designed for high-temperature solar thermal power applications. The first three layers in this tandem act as an absorbing layer, whereas, TiAlSiCO and TiAlSiO act as semi-transparent and anti-reflecting layers. The tandem absorber was deposited on stainless steel substrates using a four-cathode reactive direct current unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. The composition and thicknesses of the individual component layers have been optimized by adjusting the reactive flow rate of C2H2, N2, O2, and also Al, Ti and Si target power densities to achieve high absorptance (0.961) and low emittance (0.07 at 82°C). The reflectance data showed that the absorptance increases gradually with shift of reflectance minimum to higher wavelengths from first layer to last layer (i.e., TiAlC to TiAlSiO). The thickness of optimized tandem absorber was calculated from the cross-sectional field-emission scanning electron microscopy images and confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. The performance evaluation of the tandem absorber has been evaluated by heating it in air and vacuum under cycling conditions at different temperatures. These results showed that the tandem absorber was stable up to 325°C in air for 400h and up to 650°C in vacuum for 100h, thus demonstrating its suitability for high-temperature solar thermal power generation applications.

Abstract: The first demonstration of single contact electron beam induced current (SCEBIC) technique on multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells is reported. A lumped single-diode analytical model is also proposed to theoretically explain the SCEBIC phenomenon within solar cells as well as the current transient characteristics of the major model parameters, such as shunt resistance Rsh, junction capacitance Cj and parasitic capacitance Cs. The accuracy of the analytical model is then verified using PSPICE simulations, which show a close match with the experimental results. It is found that a large value of parasitic capacitance Cs is necessary to achieve good SCEBIC signal strength with a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and this is realized experimentally by adopting a metal enclosure in the measurement setup. In addition, an advantage of SCEBIC over the conventional double-contact method is also demonstrated by characterizing partially processed solar cells, which clearly illustrates the high degree of flexibility of SCEBIC in solar cell characterization.

Abstract: We report the study on the influences of shell thickness and core–shell structure on the optical properties of ZnO/CdS core/shell nanorods (NRs) for an elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the extended photoresponse of ZnO/CdS core/shell NRs to solar radiation. Well aligned ZnO/CdS core/shell NRs were fabricated on indium tin oxide substrates using hydrothermally grown ZnO NRs as the cores and pulsed laser deposited CdS coatings as the shells. The sample structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction and Raman backscattering spectroscopy, revealing the wurtzite structure of both the ZnO cores and CdS shells, and the improvement in the structure after annealing. The optical properties were studied through optical transmittance, absorbance and photoluminescence measurements, showing the optical properties featured with type-II heterogeneous nanostructures constructed from ZnO and CdS. The results provide a support that the optical properties of the CdS covered ZnO NRs are attributed to the suppressed radiative recombination of photogenerated carriers due to the efficient spatial separation of electrons and holes in the nanosized ZnO–CdS heterostructures.

Abstract: High quality epitaxial crystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) films were grown on n-type (100)—Germanium (Ge) substrates using pulsed electron deposition (PED) technique at a remarkably low substrate temperature of 300°C, thanks to the high-energy of adatoms arriving to the substrate. The crystalline quality was confirmed by X-ray diffraction techniques and from Transmission Electron Microscopy and the only defects found were twin boundaries along the (112) direction in these CIGS films; surprisingly neither misfit dislocations nor Kinkerdall voids were observed. A 100meV optical band located below the band edge was observed by Photoluminescence technique. Current–voltage and capacitance–voltage measurements confirm an intrinsic p-type conductivity of CIGS films, with a free carrier concentration of ≈3.5×1016cm−3. These characteristics of crystalline CIGS films are crucial for a variety of potential applications, such as more efficient absorber layers in single-junction and as an integral component of multi-junction thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: The effect of sulfur incorporation at the precursor stage on the growth and properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films prepared by a two-stage process is investigated. Two stacks, one with the precursor sequence ZnS/Sn/Cu and the other with an additional sulfur layer in the stack, were deposited sequentially by thermal evaporation onto soda-lime glass substrates held at 300°C and annealed at two different temperatures, 550°C and 580°C, to understand the effect of inclusion of sulfur precursor layer at the precursor stage. These films were analyzed by studying their elemental composition, structural, microstructural and optical properties. CZTS films exhibiting kesterite structure with (112) preferred orientation are obtained. The lattice parameters are found to be a=0.542nm and c=1.089nm. The crystallinity and the grain size are found to increase with increase in annealing temperature. With the inclusion of sulfur precursor layer in the stack, CZTS growth occurred at the precursor stage itself. On annealing this stack at 550°C for 30min, CZTS films that consist of distinct and compact grains with size in the range 400–800nm are obtained. Compared to this, the grain size of CZTS films obtained from the stack without sulfur layer in the precursor stage is found to be in the range 200–500nm. The direct optical band gap of these films is found to be between 1.44eV and 1.56eV depending on the annealing temperature and duration.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is an important mechanism for Ca2+ influx in non-excitable cells, also present in excitable cells. The activation of store-operated channels (SOCs) is finely regulated by the filling state of the intracellular agonist-sensitive Ca2+ compartments, and both, the mechanism of sensing the Ca2+ stores and the nature and functional properties of the SOCs, have been a matter of intense investigation and debate. The identification of STIM1 as the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor and both Orai1, as the pore-forming subunit of the channels mediating the Ca2+-selective store-operated current, and the members of the TRPC subfamily of proteins, as the channels mediating the cation-permeable SOCs, has shed new light on the underlying events. This review summarizes the initial hypothesis and the current advances on the mechanism of activation of SOCE.

Abstract: A linear solar-tracking spectrum-splitting scheme for solar photovoltaics is investigated. The investigation is made by means of a numerical optimization and an analytical approach to predict conversion efficiency based on available experimental data. For a simple spectrum splitting scheme, a high conversion efficiency limit of 43% without and 48% with solar concentration is predicted for two single junction solar cells. It is also shown that efficiencies of at least 37% and 41% are to be expected if state of the art cells are used. The investigation was performed using a Fourier Modal Method electromagnetic solver based on the scattering matrix formalism combined with a numerical optimizer utilizing the Evolution Strategy.

Abstract: The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) has been described for the first time about four decades ago. Since then, numerous studies have shown that this modification occurs in response to a wide variety of stimuli on five evolutionarily conserved serine residues. However, despite a large body of information on the respective kinases and the signal transduction pathways, the physiological role of rpS6 phosphorylation remained obscure until genetic manipulations were applied in both yeast and mammals in an attempt to block this modification. Thus, studies based on both mice and cultured cells subjected to disruption of the genes encoding rpS6 and the respective kinases, as well as the substitution of the phosphorylatable serine residues in rpS6, have laid the ground for the elucidation of the multiple roles of this protein and its posttranslational modification. This review focuses primarily on newly identified kinases that phosphorylate rpS6, pathways that transduce various signals into rpS6 phosphorylation, and the recently established physiological functions of this modification. It should be noted, however, that despite the significant progress made in the last decade, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the diverse effects of rpS6 phosphorylation on cellular and organismal physiology are still poorly understood.

Abstract: The oncogenic transcription factor Forkhead box M1b (FoxM1b), a key regulator of cell cycle, is often overexpressed in many human cancers. Interestingly, posttranslational modifications are known to play important role in regulating the levels and activity of FoxM1b. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the SUMOylation of FoxM1b and identify the functional consequences including viral pathogenesis. Here, we report that FoxM1b interacts with SUMOylating enzymes Ubc9 and PIAS1 and acts as a substrate for SUMOylation. We also show that SUMOylation facilitates FoxM1b protein destabilization and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. More importantly, we provide the first evidence for a role of E7 oncoprotein in high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) mediated upregulation of FoxM1b. The elevated expression of FoxM1 was determined to be posttranscriptional and was attributed to decreased SUMOylation of FoxM1b in the E7-expressing cells. Moreover, we demonstrate the involvement of SUMOylation in regulation of FoxM1 and present biochemical evidence that HPV16 E7 oncoprotein can modulate SUMOylation of FoxM1b by impairing its interaction with Ubc9. Together, these results provide a novel connection between SUMOylation of FoxM1b and HPV carcinogenesis. The findings may have important implications in the discovery of future anti-cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: A solution based approach to deposit a p-type CuI hole-transport layer that replaces PEDOT:PSS layer in the fabrication of high-efficiency poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) solar cells is reported here. X-ray diffraction analysis identifies the cubic γ-phase of CuI. A Kelvin probe measurement technique is utilized to identify the effective work function of CuI coated ITO. The device optimization is done by varying the concentration of CuI in the precursor solution which played an important role in the efficiency of the solar cell devices. In an effort to explore new inexpensive hole conducting materials for organic solar cells, we have identified copper iodide as a possible alternative. Moreover, the low temperatures required to process CuI films make it a perfect candidate to be used in organic solar cells on flexible substrates.

Abstract: Current development of fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) films for the enhancement of light trapping is limited by the tradeoff between roughness and transmittance, since none of them can be improved without sacrificing the other. In this study, we report increases in roughness from 13 to 60nm and haze from 1.2 to 10.3% for FTO films with a thickness of only 300nm, by inclusion of different additives into the deposition system. Such significant improvements are achieved whilst maintaining a low resistivity and high transmittance. This results from the development of the desired pyramidal grain morphology associated with the strengthening of (110) preferred orientation and concurrent weakening of (200) and/or (301) preferred orientations. Thus, our study provides a general strategy for developing morphology-controlled FTO films to be compared with current commercial ones with a roughness of 38nm and a thickness of 800nm, for improving the light trapping and thus the efficiency of solar cells.

Abstract: Organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells have recently attracted lots of attention in the photovoltaic community due to their escalating efficiency and solution processability. The most efficient organometallic mixed-halide sensitized solar cells often employ 2,2′7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) as the hole-transporting material. In this work, we investigated the effect of different atmospheric storage conditions, particularly vacuum, dry nitrogen, and dry air, on the photovoltaic performance of TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3−xClx–spiro-MeOTAD solar cells. We found that spin coating of spiro-MeOTAD in an oxygen atmosphere alone was not adequate to functionalize its hole-transport property completely, and our systematic experiments revealed that the device efficiency depends on the ambient atmospheric conditions during the drying process of spiro-MeOTAD. Complementary incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), light absorption and photoluminescence quenching measurements allowed us to attribute the atmosphere-dependent efficiency to the improved electronic characteristics of the solar cells. Furthermore, our Fourier transform infrared and electrical impedance measurements unambiguously detected modifications in the spiro-MeOTAD after the drying processes in different gas environments. Our findings demonstrate that proper oxidization and p-doping in functionalizing spiro-MeOTAD play a very critical role in determining device performance. These findings will facilitate the search for alternative hole-transporting materials in high-performance perovskite solar cells with long-term stability.

Abstract: Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) compositional mapping has been used to probe the mesomorphology of nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized from two very different polymer:fullerene blends: poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-alt-5, 6-bis(octyloxy)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5,5′-diyl] (PSBTBT): PCBM. The STXM data shows that both blends form core–shell NP structures with similar shell compositions, but with different polymer:fullerene ratios in the core regions. P3HT:PCBM and PSBTBT:PCBM NP organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have been fabricated and exhibit similar device efficiencies, despite the PSBTBT being a much higher performing low band gap material. By comparing the measured NP shell and core compositions with the optimized bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) compositions, we show that the relatively higher performance of the P3HT:PCBM NP device arises from the fact that its shell composition is much closer to the optimal BHJ value than that of the PSBTBT:PCBM NP device.

Abstract: Here, we present a kind of SnO2 nanowires/TiO2 nanoneedles/CdS quantum dots multi-heterojunction structure. In this rational heterojunction structure, three dimensional SnO2 nanowires were directly grown on conductive fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by chemical vapor deposition method and served as the faster electron transport network for highly efficient photoelectrochemical system. Moreover, after artful design of branched TiO2 nanoneedles on this network and then sensitized by CdS quantum dots, a multi-heterojunction structure of SnO2/TiO2/CdS was formed. This novel three dimensional multi-heterojunction structure exhibited remarkable performances on photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. The photocurrent density is as high as 8.75mAcm−2 at a potential of 0V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) by using the optimized conditions. More impressively, the photocurrent density is more than 4 times larger than that of single SnO2–TiO2 heterojunction (1.72mAcm−2) at 0V vs. SCE.

Abstract: The photovoltaic performance of a GaN p-n-n homojunction is characterized using the air-mass (AM) 1.5G solar spectrum and a 532-nm green laser. The n-type active region is doped with Si in order to create an intermediate band for sub-bandgap photon absorption. When the doping level in the active region increases from 0 (unintentionally doped) to n=1×1018cm−3, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) under illumination by the green laser is noticeably reduced, whereas the Jsc under AM1.5G is significantly enhanced by 90%. The results indicate that the Si-induced intermediate band is partially filled, a key feature favored by intermediate band solar cells.

Abstract: The induction of inner ear hair cells from stem cells or progenitor cells in the inner ear proceeds through a committed inner ear sensory progenitor cell stage prior to hair cell differentiation. To increase the efficacy of inducing inner ear hair cell differentiation from the stem cells or progenitor cells, it is essential to identify comprehensive markers for the stem cells/progenitor cells from the inner ear, the committed inner ear sensory progenitor cells and the differentiating hair cells to optimize induction conditions. Here, we report that we efficiently isolated and expanded the stem cells or progenitor cells from postnatal mouse cochleae, and induced the generation of inner ear progenitor cells and subsequent differentiation of hair cells. We profiled the gene expression of the stem cells or progenitor cells, the inner ear progenitor cells, and hair cells using aRNA microarray analysis. The pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed. Analysis of genes exclusively detected in one particular cellular population revealed 30, 38, and 31 genes specific for inner ear stem cells, inner ear progenitor cells, and hair cells, respectively. We further examined the expression of these genes in vivo and determined that Gdf10+Ccdc121, Tmprss9+Orm1, and Chrna9+Espnl are marker genes specific for inner ear stem cells, inner ear progenitor cells, and differentiating hair cells, respectively. The identification of these marker genes will likely help the effort to increase the efficacy of hair cell induction from the stem cells or progenitor cells.

Abstract: Nanog plays an important role in maintaining the pluripotency of murine and human embryonic stem cells. However, the molecular features and transcriptional regulation of the NANOG gene have not been well investigated in pig. Here, we report, for the first time, that porcine NANOG is encoded by a single exon gene (SEG) mapped on chromosome 1 and has two daughter genes, one pseudogene NANOGP1 on chromosome 5 and one tandem duplicate on chromosome 1. The duplicated pseudogene NANOGP2 has high sequence similarity to NANOG, but does not encode a functional protein due to deletions and in-frame stop codons. The NANOGP1 contains four exons and three introns, but is short of the homeodomain sequence. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that NANOG mRNA in porcine iPS cells is transcribed from the SEG NANOG, but not from NANOGP1, because the NANOGP1 promoter is highly methylated, as confirmed by global DNA methylation analysis. The NANOG protein encoded by NANOG retains N, H, and C1/W/C2 domains. The H domain is required for nuclear translocation, while the C1/W/C2 domain ensures the NANOG regulatory function. Overexpression of NANOG in porcine embryonic fibroblasts promoted upregulation of its target genes SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC. In conclusion, the functional porcine NANOG that is different in chromosomal structure from mouse and human genes is a single exon gene and encodes the functional NANOG protein that can be specifically regulated by OCT4/SOX2, and can promote the activation of target pluripotent factors in vivo.

Abstract: In this work, we present the incorporation of a laser doped selective emitter into the i-PERC platform at Imec using large area magnetically confined boron-doped Czochralski grown silicon wafers. Cells were fabricated with self-aligned plated n-type contacts with a comparison between the use of a homogenous emitter with contact openings formed by picosecond laser ablation and a selective emitter formed by laser doping with a mode-locked UV laser using various processing speeds. Without modification to other processes in the i-PERC platform, improvements in efficiency of approximately 0.4% absolute were obtained with the inclusion of the selective emitter structure through improvements in open circuit voltage, fill factor and reduced series resistance. This resulted in peak efficiencies of 20.5% using a processing speed for laser doping of 5m/s.

Abstract: A unique feature in mammalian erythropoiesis is the dramatic chromatin condensation followed by enucleation. This step-by-step process starts at the beginning of terminal erythropoiesis after the hematopoietic stem cells are committed to erythroid lineage. Although this phenomenon is known for decades, the mechanisms of chromatin condensation and enucleation remain elusive. Recent advances in cell and molecular biology have started to reveal the molecular pathways in the regulation of chromatin condensation, the establishment of nuclear polarity prior enucleation, and the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton in enucleation. However, many challenging questions, especially whether and how the apoptotic mechanisms are involved in chromatin condensation and how to dissect the functions of many actin cytoskeleton proteins in cytokinesis and enucleation, remain to be answered. Here I review our current understanding of mammalian erythroid chromatin condensation and enucleation during terminal differentiation with a focus on more recent studies. I conclude with my perspective of future works in this rising topic in developmental and cell biology.

Abstract: The potential cause of blindness worldwide includes diseases of the cornea, ocular surface (limbal stem cell deficiency, allergic conjunctivitis, dry eye diseases), and retinal diseases. The presence of stem cells (limbal stem cells) in the basal region of the limbus makes it an important tool for the ocular regeneration and also in maintaining the transparency of eye by replacing the corneal epithelium continuously. Various surgical modalities have been developed like cultured limbal epithelial transplantation, cultured oral mucosal epithelial transplantation, simple limbal epithelial transplantation, etc., utilizing the cell-based regenerative properties to treat limbal disorder. Cell-based therapies for ocular repair and regeneration comprise a major hope by therapies involving the mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and limbal stem cells for the restoration of vision in individuals whose ocular tissue has been irreversibly damaged by disease or trauma. This review explores critical needs in human disease mainly the ocular problem where cell-based therapeutics is exceptionally well suited and also the use of animal models, various artificial scaffolds, as well as advancement in clinical technique to challenge the current demand to overcome corneal blindness.

Abstract: Wnt5a is involved in the activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling, including planar cell polarity (PCP) and Wnt-Ca2+ pathways. The Ror-family of receptor tyrosine kinases is composed of Ror1 and Ror2 in mammals. Ror2 acts as a receptor or coreceptor for Wnt5a and regulates Wnt5a-induced activation of PCP pathway, and Wnt5a–Ror2 axis indeed plays critical roles in the developmental morphogenesis by regulating cell polarity and migration. Furthermore, Wnt5a–Ror2 axis is constitutively activated in cancer cells and confers highly motile and invasive properties on cancer cells through the expression of matrix metalloproteinase genes and enhanced formation of invadopodia. Meanwhile, Wnt5a also exhibits a tumor-suppressive function in certain cancers, including breast and colorectal carcinomas. Thus, it is of great importance to understand the respective molecular mechanisms governing Wnt5a-mediated tumor-progressive and tumor-suppressive functions, in order to develop novel and proper diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting Wnt5a signaling for human cancers.

Abstract: The non-radiative recombination properties of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 [CIGS] solar cells were investigated locally through photothermal [PT] measurements by atomic force microscopy under various kinds of incident light with photon energies above or below the bandgap of CIGS. We found that the intensity and spatial distribution of the PT signal strongly depended on the photon energy of the incident light and on the Ga content of the CIGS layer. These results suggest the possibilities that photo-generated free electrons could accumulate near the grain boundary because of the built-in electric field and that sub-gap states with discrete energy levels are present in the CIGS material.

Abstract: Solar cell with textured front surface and back reflector, show enhanced current density due to improved light management. We investigated n–i–p type amorphous silicon solar cells that were deposited on pyramidally textured c-Si substrates. Additional Ag/AZO back reflector (BR) layers were also used in some cells, where AZO is aluminum doped zinc oxide. We estimated that an initial 27% enhancement in short circuit current density (Jsc) was due to improved light capture due to the surface texture (without the BR). With the smooth pyramidal BR the additional 0.82 mA/cm2 enhancement in Jsc is partly due to the reflection of unabsorbed light from the back to the cell, while for the cell deposited on multi textured BR a further improvement in the Jsc by 1.3 mA/cm2 was observed due to a further reduction in reflection loss of the incident light at the front surface of the cell. The quantum efficiency enhancement factor, which is considered an important parameter of light trapping, increases with the successive introduction of the BRs. We used a classical ray diagram to investigate the light inside the cell as well as AFORS HET computer simulation for estimating its electrical characteristics and wave optical numerical simulation was carried out to investigate behavior of light due to the various surface textures of the cells.

Abstract: Trichomonas vaginalis expresses multiple proteinases, mainly of the cysteine type (CPs). A cathepsin L-like 34kDa CP, designated TvCP4, is synthesized as a 305-amino-acid precursor protein. TvCP4 contains the prepro fragment and the catalytic triad that is typical of the papain-like CP family of clan CA. The aim of this work was to determine the function of the recombinant TvCP4 prepro region (ppTvCP4r) as a specific inhibitor of CPs. We cloned, expressed, and purified the recombinant TvCP4 prepro region. The conformation of the purified and refolded ppTvCP4r polypeptide was verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence emission spectra. The inhibitory effect of ppTvCP4r was tested on protease-resistant extracts from T. vaginalis using fluorogenic substrates for cathepsin L and legumain CPs. In 1-D zymograms, the inhibitory effect of ppTvCP4r on trichomonad CP proteolytic activity was observed in the ∼97, 65, 39, and 30kDa regions. By using 2-D zymograms and mass spectrometry, several of the CPs inhibited by ppTvCP4r were identified. A clear reduction in the proteolytic activity of several cathepsin L-like protein spots (TvCP2, TvCP4, TvCP4-like, and TvCP39) was observed compared with the control zymogram. Moreover, pretreatment of live parasites with ppTvCP4r inhibited trichomonal haemolysis in a concentration dependent manner. These results confirm that the recombinant ppTvCP4 is a specific inhibitor of the proteolytic activity of cathepsin L-like T. vaginalis CPs that is useful for inhibiting virulence properties depending on clan CA papain-like CPs.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been suggested as new drug targets to treat a variety of diseases. In sickle cell disease (SCD), the LW erythrocyte adhesion receptor can be activated by stimulation of β2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs), to mediate sickle erythrocyte (SSRBC) adhesion to endothelium. However, the involvement of tyrosine protein kinases in β2AR signaling to activate SSRBC adhesion to endothelium has not been thoroughly elucidated. Either direct activation with Cholera toxin of Gαs protein, which acts downstream of β2ARs, or inhibition with Pertussis toxin of Gαi, mediating suppression of adenylyl cyclase, increased SSRBC adhesion to endothelium over baseline adhesion. This effect involved the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, p72Syk and p60-c-Src, which were more abundant in SSRBCs than in normal erythrocytes. In contrast, Pertussis toxin and Cholera toxin failed to increase adhesion of normal erythrocytes. SSRBC Gαi inhibition also increased phosphorylation of p72Syk and p60-c-Src. Further, we investigated the relevance of activation of p72Syk and p60-c-Src, and identified LW (ICAM-4, CD242) and CD44 as the erythroid adhesion molecules both physically interacting with activated p60-c-Src. As a result, SSRBC LW underwent increased tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to SSRBC LW and CD44 binding to endothelial αvβ3 integrin and CD44, respectively. These data provide in vitro mechanistic evidence that p60-c-Src, which could act downstream of Gαs/p72Syk, associates with LW and CD44 on SSRBCs leading to their interactions with endothelial αvβ3 and CD44, respectively. Thus, increased activation of these signaling mechanisms in SSRBCs could initiate or exacerbate vascular occlusion, the hallmark of SCD.

Abstract: Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on TiO2/MWCNTs composite with varying concentrations of CNTs (0, 0.03. 0.06, 0.09, 0.15, and 0.21wt%), fabricated using N3 dye as a sensitizer. Transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm the dispersion of carbon nanotubes in TiO2. UV–visible absorption spectroscopy, photocurrent–voltage characteristics, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements were conducted to characterize the DSSCs. The results show that the photo conversion efficiency is highly dependent on the concentration of CNTs in the photoanode. A solar cell based on a photoanode containing 0.03wt% MWCNTs has a power conversion efficiency which is about 30% greater than that of the unmodified photoanode. A quantum modeling technique based on the density functional theory was used to investigate the thermodynamic aspects of the charge transport processes in DSSCs. Simulation results support the experimental data.

Abstract: After our recent demonstration of a 3D-printed external light trap on a small solar cell, we now consider its potential for large solar panels. An external light trap consists of a parabolic concentrator and a spacer that redirects the photons that are reflected by the solar cell back towards the solar cell. These retro-reflections enable higher absorptance and improved power conversion efficiency. Scaling a single external light trap such that it covers a large solar panel has disadvantages in terms of height and cost of the external light trap. These disadvantages can be overcome by deploying an array of concentrators as the top part of the external light trap. We present an optimization study of concentrator arrays for external light trapping. We fabricated 3D-printed external light traps with a square, hexagonal and circular compound parabolic concentrator to test their suitability for concentrator arrays. The 3D-printed traps were placed on top of an organic solar cell which resulted in a significant enhancement of the external quantum efficiency. The required transmittance of these concentrator arrays is calculated as a function of the parameters of both the concentrator and the solar cell. We compare the theoretical and experimentally determined optical performance of the different concentrators. Finally, the prospects of external light trapping are analyzed and we give guidelines for improvements of the external light trap design.

Abstract: Several attempts have been carried out to manufacture intermediate band solar cells (IBSC) by means of quantum dot (QD) superlattices. This novel photovoltaic concept allows the collection of a wider range of the sunlight spectrum in order to provide higher cell photocurrent while maintaining the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the cell. In this work, we analyze InAs/GaAsN QD-IBSCs. In these cells, the dilute nitrogen in the barrier plays an important role for the strain-balance (SB) of the QD layer region that would otherwise create dislocations under the effect of the accumulated strain. The introduction of GaAsN SB layers allows increasing the light absorption in the QD region by multi-stacking more than 100 QD layers. The photo-generated current density (JL) versus VOC was measured under varied concentrated light intensity and temperature. We found that the VOC of the cell at 20K is limited by the bandgap of the GaAsN barriers, which has important consequences regarding IBSC bandgap engineering that are also discussed in this work.

Abstract: This paper reports the chemical and optical characterization of a cost effective down-converter polymeric film based on an Eu(III) complex embedded in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) which placed on conventional photovoltaic (PV) glass, used for module assembly, produces an increase in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a reference Si-based solar cell. Our results show that the best location of the down-converter is on the front surface of the glass. The UV absorption of the down-converter protects and enhances the stability of the PMMA film. This increase in EQE is further enlarged by placing a light trap on the device, collecting most of the down-converted photons, which are isotropically emitted. Additional increases in EQE are expected after a proper encapsulation of the solar cell and the glass. Thermogravimetric measurements show that the down-converter active specie is stable up to 275°C and the PMMA film is stable up to 225°C, consequently, it can be applied in any step of the lamination process in the production of PV modules. Thereby, the down-converter can be profitably applied in Si-based solar cells and modules, particularly in concentrated PV systems.

Abstract: The most important limitation for the efficiency of photovoltaic energy conversion is related to the mismatch between the broadband character of the solar radiation and the spectral sensitivity of solar cells. Large losses appear at both sides of the solar spectrum. Low-energy photons are not absorbed and escape conversion, whereas high-energy photons can only be utilized partially. Here, we discuss how the loss related to low-energy photons can be reduced by spectral conversion, making use of active layers of Si nanocrystals in an SiO2 matrix. As a possible solution, we consider generation of hot carriers upon sequential intraband absorption of two or more low-energy photons and present experimental data in support of this. Configurations are proposed in which efficient spectral conversion could be achieved, and their feasibilities are discussed. We also address the fast emission from Er3+ ions, purposefully introduced into the active layer, which can be used to trace the successful generation of hot carriers, and in that way serve to evaluate specific excitation schemes.

Abstract: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections can cause hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), meningoencephalitis, neonatal sepsis, and even fatal encephalitis in children. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for EV71 infection due to the lack of understanding of viral replication and infection; and viral infections have emerged as an imperative global hazard. Thus, it is extremely important to understand the mechanism of EV71 replication in order to prevent and control the diseases associated with EV71 infections. Early growth response-1 (EGR1) is a multifunctional transcription factor that regulates diverse biological functions, including inflammation, apoptosis, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and even viral infection. Here, we provide new insight into the role of EV71 infection in regulating EGR1 production; and reveal a novel mechanism by which EGR1 facilitates EV71 replication. We demonstrate that EV71 activates EGR1 expression during infection by stimulating the protein kinase A/protein kinase Cɛ/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PKA/PKCɛ/PI3K/Akt) cascade. We further reveal that EV71-activated EGR1, in turn, regulates the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) of EV71 to enhance viral replication. In addition, EGR1 facilitates EV71 replication by binding directly to stem-loops I and IV of EV71 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR) with its first two zinc fingers. Moreover, EGR1 protein co-localizes with EV71 RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells to facilitate viral replication. Our results reveal an important new role of EGR1 in viral infection, provide new insight into the novel mechanism underlying the regulation of EV71 replication, and suggest a potential application of EGR1 in the control of EV71 infection.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal localization of signals is a fundamental feature impacting cell survival and proper function. The cell needs to respond in an accurate manner in both space and time to both intra- and intercellular environment cues. The regulation of this comprehensive process involves the cytoskeleton and the trafficking machinery, as well as local protein synthesis and ligand–receptor mechanisms. Alterations in such mechanisms can lead to cell dysfunction and disease. Motor neurons that can extend over tens of centimeters are a classic example for the importance of such events. Changes in spatiotemporal localization mechanisms are thought to play a role in motor neuron degeneration that occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review we will discuss these mechanisms and argue that possible misregulated factors can lead to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

Abstract: Three distinct low bandgap copolymers are synthesized by the combination of N-(2′-propylpentanoyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) and (fluorinated) 2,3-bis[5′-(2”-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2′-yl]quinoxaline (Qx) and these PDTPQx derivatives are investigated as electron donor materials in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. Due to the DTP N-acylation and the introduction of the Qx units, both the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) increase compared to previous devices based on DTP-type donor polymers. Organic solar cells with an average Voc of 0.67V, a Jsc of 12.57mA/cm² and a fill factor of 0.54 are obtained, affording a power conversion efficiency of 4.53% (4.81% for the top-performing device), a record value for (N-acyl-)DTP-based polymer solar cells devoid of special interlayer materials. Despite further enhancement of the Voc, the solar cell efficiency declines for the fluorinated PDTPQx copolymers because of the inability to achieve a finely intermixed bulk heterojunction blend nanomorphology.

Abstract: High-haze and wide-spectrum hydrogenated Mg and Ga co-doped ZnO (HMGZO) transparent conductive oxide films on ‘U-shaped’ micro-textured glass are developed using magnetron sputtering. The wet-chemically etched glass substrates with large crater-like features obtained via a frosting method exhibit strong light-scattering capability in a wide wavelength range (~350–1100nm). The morphological, structural, optical and electrical properties of HMGZO films on textured and flat glass are investigated in detail. The HMGZO thin films deposited on textured glasses show conformal growth and have a polycrystalline hexagonal wurtzite phase with a c-axis preferred orientation, which is similar to that of films deposited on flat glass. The electrical resistivity of HMGZO films decreases from 9.74×10−4 to 7.67×10−4Ωcm and the optical band gap Eg is in the range from 3.76 to 3.72eV as the deposition time is increased from 25 to 40min. The HMGZO films with textured glass substrate exhibit stronger light-scattering capability compared with films with flat glass substrate. Finally, an a-Si solar cell deposited on textured glass shows a higher conversion efficiency and short-circuit current density than that deposited on flat glass, as a result of effectively improved light scattering. ZnO-TCO films on low-cost chemically etched glass substrates are promising candidates as front electrodes for thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Podoplanin is a small mucin-like transmembrane protein expressed in several adult tissues and with an important role during embryogenesis. It is needed for the proper development of kidneys and lungs as well as accurate formation of the lymphatic vascular system. In addition, it is involved in the physiology of the immune system. A wide variety of tumors express podoplanin, both in the malignant cells and in the stroma. Although there are exceptions, the presence of podoplanin results in poor prognosis. The main consequence of forced podoplanin expression in established and tumor-derived cell lines is an increase in cell migration and, eventually, the triggering of an epithelial–mesenchymal transition, whereby cells acquire a fibroblastoid phenotype and increased motility. We will examine the current status of the role of podoplanin in the induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition as well as the different interactions that lead to this program.

Abstract: In this study, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate high performance of antireflection (AR) coating composed of the ZnO nanorods (NRs) and TiO2 layers applied on InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells. The high performance of this AR coating is due to the realization of a smooth gradient profile of refractive index fabricated by only two physical layers. First, due to the inherent inhomogeneous-nanoporous geometry along the surface normal, the ZnO NRs are reasonable to be considered as discrete multiple optical layers with low scattering loss, leading to the index smoothly increasing from air ambient toward down to the solar cells. Second, to compensate the gap of index between ZnO and solar cells, an additional TiO2 layer with index in between is hence necessary to insert under ZnO NRs, significantly further reducing the Fresnel reflection loss of the entire device. The ZnO NRs/ TiO2 layer shows a low wavelength-averaged (solar spectrum weighted) reflectance of 6.00% (4.78%) over a wide spectral range of λ=380–1800nm, and exhibits a hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 128.2°. At device level, we compared the photovoltaic performance of solar cells with and without AR coating, the short-circuit density (JSC) is enhanced by 31.8% and 23.8% for solar cells integrated with the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer and conventional SiO2/TiO2 double-layer AR (DLAR) coating, respectively. Under a very large incident angle of solar illumination (θ=80°), the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer remains static with JSC enhancement of 35.2%, whereas the JSC enhancement of conventional DLAR coating drops down to 9.4%. In addition, the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer barely affects the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar device. Therefore, the proposed ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer with a smoother graded refractive index change is highly promising for the AR coating applications for the next-generation solar cells.

Abstract: Thermal-cracking system has been adopted to produce cracked selenium and the influence of cracked selenium flux on the structure and reaction pathway during the first-step selenization is investigated. High Cracked-Selenium (HC-Se) may facilitate the Cu–Se and In–Se reaction at lower temperatures. The “Polygon grains” observed in the HC-Se samples play a key role in further selenium diffusion into the film since they make the film more incompact. In addition, activation energy analysis indicates that Cu2−xSe and β-In2Se3 formed in the samples prepared in HC-Se atmosphere may result in different growth pathway of Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 (CIGS) thin film compared with that prepared in Low Cracked-Selenium (LC-Se) atmosphere during the first-step selenization, which restrains lamination in CIGS films effectively so that the distribution of Ga is more uniform throughout CIGS films and no small grains of CuGaSe2 (CGS) accumulate near the Mo back-contact. As a result, the shunt conductance in this CIGS thin film device prepared in HC-Se is reduced, and the fill factor, open-circuit voltage, as well as the cell efficiency are improved.

Abstract: Varying the donor–acceptor ratio is a common technique in optimising organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance. Here we fabricate poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) nanoparticle OPVs with varied donor–acceptor ratios from 1:0.5 to 1:2. Device performance increases with PCBM loading from 1:0.5 to 1:1, then surprisingly from 1:1 to 1:2 the performance plateaus, unlike reported trends in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs where device performance drops significantly as the donor:acceptor ratio increases beyond 1:1. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) measurements reveal core–shell nanoparticles for all donor:acceptor ratios with a systematic increase in the PCBM nanoparticle core volume observed as the PCBM loading is increased. This increases the functional PCBM domain size available for exciton harvesting, contrary to the result observed in BHJ OPV devices where increasing the PCBM loading does not lead to an increase in functional PCBM domains. In addition, STXM measurements reveal that the core–shell nanoparticles have core and shell compositions that change with PCBM loading. In particular, we observe that the PCBM component in the nanoparticle shell phase increases from a concentration that is below the percolation limit to one that is close to the optimal weight fraction for charge transport. This increase in the functional PCBM volume is reflected in an increase in PCBM photocurrent calculated from external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements.

Abstract: High efficiency, thin-film Epitaxial Lift-Off (ELO) III–V solar cells offer excellent characteristics for implementation in flexible solar panels for space applications. However, the current thin-film ELO solar cell design generally includes a copper handling and support foil. Copper diffusion has a potentially detrimental effect on the device performance and the challenging environment provided by space (high temperatures, electron and proton irradiation) might induce diffusion. It is shown that heat treatments induce copper diffusion. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) is the most affected solar cell parameter. The decrease in Voc can be explained by enhanced non-radiative recombination via Cu trap levels in the middle of the band gap. The decrease in Voc is found to be dependent on junction depth. In all Cu cells annealed at T≥300°C signs of Cu diffusion are present, which implies that a barrier layer inhibiting Cu diffusion is necessary. Electron radiation damage was found to have no influence on Cu diffusion.

Abstract: The total emissivity of the absorbing surfaces is a critical parameter in the calculation of the radiative thermal losses in solar thermal collectors. This is because the radiative heat losses have a significant economic impact on the final cost of the electricity produced in a solar thermal plant. This paper demonstrates the need to calculate the total emissivity from spectral emissivity measurements at the working temperature of the solar thermal collector, instead of using extrapolated values from spectral emissivities measured at room temperature. Usual uncertainties produced by the estimation of the total emissivity, in which its temperature dependence is only introduced by the Planck function, are analyzed.

Abstract: In this study, electrochromic properties of cobaltphthalocyanine (CoPc) immobilized on ITO electrode with electropolymerization were investigated (ITO/CoPc). CoPc substituted with electropolymerizable quinoline moieties was oxidatively electropolymerized on the working electrode during anodic potential scans with the help of polymerizable quinolone groups. In situ spectroelectrochemical measurements of CoPc in solution and in solid state showed that a metal based redox process of CoPc affected the optical spectrum more than the Pc based redox process as the existed bands shifted and new bands appeared, which showed the electrochromic feature of the complex. In order to investigate potential utility of the complex as electrochromic material, electrochromic properties of ITO/CoPc thin film were investigated in detail with various electrochemical, in-situ spectroelectrochemical and in-situ electrocolorimetric analysis methods. ITO/CoPc thin film showed reversible color change between cyan and purple colors. Short response times, high optic contrast and optical and coulombic stabilities of CoPc film indicate possible application of CoPc as anodic and cathodic coloring material in the display technologies.

Abstract: Thin film tandem solar cells based on amorphous and microcrystalline silicon (MicromorphTM in superstrate configuration) benefit from strongly light-scattering nano-textured substrates. A development methodology for the evaluation of the performance of the Micromorph test cells deposited on such substrates with very different surface shapes is presented and illustrated. It is shown that growth related defects and non-conformal coverage of the silicon layers restrict the choice of surface shapes for this photovoltaic application. General guidelines are given in this study for the preferred selection of the surface geometry for MicromorphTM test cells. The results indicate that the application of advanced surface shapes for higher conversion efficiencies requires improved silicon deposition process compared to current industrial state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The negative charge formation, the charge-trapping mechanisms and the interface defect passivation of aluminum oxide/silicon nitride (AlOx/SiNx) stacks deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition on p-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) are investigated. Constant voltage stress (CVS) investigations combined with capacitance–voltage (C–V) hysteresis analysis indicate the influence of different thermal treatments on the negative charge formation and allow discerning between fixed and trapped charges in the AlOx/SiNx system. The thermal budget during SiNx deposition activates negatively charged traps. An annealing step leads to the formation of a stable, fixed negative charge and reduces the defect state density (Dit) at the c-Si/AlOx interface. A wet-chemical silicon oxidation (SiOx) of the c-Si surface reduces Dit even further, but introduces additional traps at the wet-chemical SiOx/AlOx interface. These traps lead to instabilities of the negative charge density and have a detrimental effect on the passivation quality. However, a firing step leads to the formation of a higher negative charge density due to charged traps. Combined with the enhanced chemical passivation, this results in a higher passivation quality than upon annealing. The trap-related negative charge upon firing is unstable due to electron detrapping. However, a positive CVS can recharge traps in the wet-chemical SiOx/AlOx/SiNx system negatively through electron injection from the c-Si.
