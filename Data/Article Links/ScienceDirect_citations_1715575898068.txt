Abstract: Summary
ARX788 is an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody-drug conjugate with AS269 as cytotoxic payload. In this phase 1 multicenter dose-expansion clinical trial, patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma failing to respond to prior trastuzumab-based standard treatment were enrolled. Between July 15th, 2019, and March 14th, 2022, 30 participants were enrolled. Twenty-eight (93.3%) patients experienced at least one drug-related adverse event (AE) and 13.3% experienced grade 3 ARX788-related AEs. The confirmed objective response rate is 37.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.7%–57.7%) and the disease control rate is 55.2% (95% CI: 35.7%–73.6%). With a median follow up of 10 months, the median progression-free survival and overall survival are 4.1 (95% CI: 1.4–6.4) and 10.7 months (95% CI: 4.8–not reached), respectively. The median duration of response is 8.4 (95% CI: 2.1–18.9) months. ARX788 is well tolerated and has promising anti-tumor activity in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (ChinaDrugTrials.org.cn: CTR20190639).

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) suppress CD4+ T cell activation and may promote latent HIV infection. By performing leukapheresis (n = 21) and lymph node biopsies (n = 8) in people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and sorting memory CD4+ T cells into subsets based on PD1/CTLA4 expression, we investigate the role of PD1 and CTLA 4 in HIV persistence. We show that double-positive (PD1+CTLA4+) cells in blood contain more HIV DNA compared with double-negative (PD1−CTLA4−) cells but still have a lower proportion of cells producing multiply spliced HIV RNA after stimulation as well as reduced upregulation of T cell activation and proliferation markers. Transcriptomics analyses identify differential expression of key genes regulating T cell activation and proliferation with MAF, KLRB1, and TIGIT being upregulated in double-positive compared with double-negative cells, whereas FOS is downregulated. We conclude that, in addition to being enriched for HIV DNA, double-positive cells are characterized by negative signaling and a reduced capacity to respond to stimulation, favoring HIV latency.

Abstract: Summary
Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is common among post-menopausal women and is associated with bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Surgical repair with the patients’ native tissues is sub-optimal with high reoperation rates, potentially due to diminished age-related healing. We demonstrate that systemic transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) improves healing of full-thickness vaginal incision in the vaginal wall of old rats, as suggested by both histological and functional analysis. Transplanted MSCs homed and survived at the surgical vaginal site. Attenuation of the injury-induced inflammatory response, increased angiogenesis, and reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression were observed at the surgical site of transplanted rats. Most importantly, the functional biomechanical properties of the healed vagina, at day 30 post-injury, were improved in MSC-transplanted, compared with sham-operated non-transplanted, old rats. These results may pave the way to further translational studies toward clinical transplantation of MSCs adjuvant to POP repair for the improvement of surgical outcome.

Abstract: Arma chinensis is an important predatory enemy of many agricultural and forest pests. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) plays an essential role in insect adaptation to various stress factors. To explore the functions of Hsp70s in relation to thermal tolerance of A. chinensis, full-length cDNAs of six Hsp70 genes (AcHsp70Ba, AcHsp70-4, AcHsp68a, AcHsp68b, AcHsp70-2, and AcHsc70-4) were cloned. Their open reading frames (ORFs) were 1902, 2454, 1884, 1905, 1872, and 1947 bp, respectively. Developmental expression profiles showed that AcHsp70Ba, AcHsp70-4, and AcHsc70-4 were extremely highly expressed in adult stages. AcHsp68a and AcHsp70-2 showed the highest level of expression in nymph stages, and AcHsp68b was mainly expressed in male adults. Tissue distribution analysis demonstrated that the AcHsp70s were ubiquitously expressed but showing gene-specific and sex-driven patterns of expression. High temperature induced the expression of the six AcHsp70s. Among them, AcHsp70Ba, AcHsp70-4, AcHsp68a, and AcHsc70-4 were significantly induced at 38°C for 6 h, while all six AcHsp70s were significantly induced at 38°C for 24 h. There were differences in responses of the six AcHsp70s to low-temperature stress. The expressions of AcHsp70-4, AcHsp68a, and AcHsp68b in male adults were significantly repressed at 4°C for 6 h, whereas AcHsp70Ba and AcHsp70-2 were significantly induced. The levels of AcHsp70Ba, AcHsp68b, and AcHsp70-2 in female adults were significantly repressed at 4°C for 24 h, whereas AcHsc70-4 was significantly induced. These results suggested that AcHsp70s play important roles in various developmental stages and tissue function, and contribute to the tolerance of A. chinensis to extreme temperatures.

Abstract: Summary
Gut-microbiota membership is associated with diverse neuropsychological outcomes, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Here, we use mice colonized with Citrobacter rodentium or the human γ-Proteobacteria commensal Escherichia coli HS as a model to examine the mechanistic interactions between gut microbes and host responses to cocaine. We find that cocaine exposure increases intestinal norepinephrine levels that are sensed through the bacterial adrenergic receptor QseC to promote intestinal colonization of γ-Proteobacteria. Colonized mice show enhanced host cocaine-induced behaviors. The neuroactive metabolite glycine, a bacterial nitrogen source, is depleted in the gut and cerebrospinal fluid of colonized mice. Systemic glycine repletion reversed, and γ-Proteobacteria mutated for glycine uptake did not alter the host response to cocaine. γ-Proteobacteria modulated glycine levels are linked to cocaine-induced transcriptional plasticity in the nucleus accumbens through glutamatergic transmission. The mechanism outline here could potentially be exploited to modulate reward-related brain circuits that contribute to SUDs.

Abstract: Summary
“Pan-coronavirus” antivirals targeting conserved viral components can be designed. Here, we show that the rationally engineered H84T-banana lectin (H84T-BanLec), which specifically recognizes high mannose found on viral proteins but seldom on healthy human cells, potently inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (including Omicron), and other human-pathogenic coronaviruses at nanomolar concentrations. H84T-BanLec protects against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Importantly, intranasally and intraperitoneally administered H84T-BanLec are comparably effective. Mechanistic assays show that H84T-BanLec targets virus entry. High-speed atomic force microscopy depicts real-time multimolecular associations of H84T-BanLec dimers with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer. Single-molecule force spectroscopy demonstrates binding of H84T-BanLec to multiple SARS-CoV-2 spike mannose sites with high affinity and that H84T-BanLec competes with SARS-CoV-2 spike for binding to cellular ACE2. Modeling experiments identify distinct high-mannose glycans in spike recognized by H84T-BanLec. The multiple H84T-BanLec binding sites on spike likely account for the drug compound’s broad-spectrum antiviral activity and the lack of resistant mutants.

Aerobic glycolysis and tumor progression of hepatocellular carcinoma are mediated by ubiquitin of P53 K48-linked regulated by TRIM37,

Abstract: Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer in the world. In malignant liver cancer, the increase of aerobic glycolysis indicates that the possibility of tumorigenesis is greatly enhanced. TRIM37 is a member of the TRIM family of proteins that possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and has been implicated in the occurrence and prognosis of many different tumors. However, the stability of P53 plays an important role in preventing tumorigenesis. The mechanism by which TRIM37 regulates the stability of P53 through ubiquitin in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma is still unclear.
Materials and methods
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of mRNA and protein in HCC cells. Lactic acid production, glucose uptake, and ATP levels were measured by BioVision kit. The following were used to assess the in vitro function of TRIM37 in HCC cells: cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation assay, cell migration and invasion assay, and flow cytometry. We observed the effect of TRIM37 on the growth of transplanted tumors in nude mice. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) revealed a binding relationship between TRIM37 and P53.
Results
The expression of TRIM37 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues was higher than that of normal tissues according to an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.Loss-of-function assays indicated that TRIM37 inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cells. The mechanism is as follows: TRIM37 interacts with the P53 protein to induce E3 ligase activity, ubiquitination, and degradation, further promoting the malignant characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma, thus promoting the process of glycolysis. Genetic knockdown of P53 reversed the promoting function of TRIM37 on the growth and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
Conclusions
Our study showed that the TRIM37-P53 axis plays a role in the progression of liver cancer, and thus is a potential target for the treatment of liver cancer.

Abstract: Leukemia is a type of blood cancer characterized by high genetic heterogeneity and fatality. While chemotherapy remains the primary form of treatment for leukemia, its effectiveness was profoundly diminished by the genetic heterogeneity and cytogenetic abnormalities of leukemic cells. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop precision medicine for leukemia with distinct genetic backgrounds. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), a freshwater fish with exceptional feasibility in genome editing, is a powerful tool for rapid human cancer modeling. In the past decades, zebrafish have been adopted in modeling human leukemia, exploring the molecular mechanisms of underlying genetic abnormalities, and discovering novel therapeutic agents. Although many recurrent mutations of leukemia have been modeled in zebrafish for pathological study and drug discovery, its great potential in leukemia modeling was not yet fully exploited, particularly in precision medicine. In this review, we evaluated the current zebrafish models of leukemia/pre-leukemia and genetic techniques and discussed the potential of zebrafish models with novel techniques, which may contribute to the development of zebrafish as a disease model for precision medicine in treating leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) allows the study of epigenetic regulation of gene expression by assessing chromatin configuration for an entire genome. Despite its popularity, there have been limited studies investigating the analytical challenges related to ATAC-seq data, with most studies leveraging tools developed for bulk transcriptome sequencing. Here, we show that GC-content effects are omnipresent in ATAC-seq datasets. Since the GC-content effects are sample specific, they can bias downstream analyses such as clustering and differential accessibility analysis. We introduce a normalization method based on smooth-quantile normalization within GC-content bins and evaluate it together with 11 different normalization procedures on 8 public ATAC-seq datasets. Accounting for GC-content effects in the normalization is crucial for common downstream ATAC-seq data analyses, improving accuracy and interpretability. Through case studies, we show that exploratory data analysis is essential to guide the choice of an appropriate normalization method for a given dataset.

Abstract: Summary
Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariant, BA.2.75, displayed a growth advantage over circulating BA.2.38, BA.2.76, and BA.5 in India. However, the underlying mechanisms for enhanced infectivity, especially compared with BA.5, remain unclear. Here, we show that BA.2.75 exhibits substantially higher affinity for host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) than BA.5 and other variants. Structural analyses of BA.2.75 spike shows its decreased thermostability and increased frequency of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the “up” conformation under acidic conditions, suggesting enhanced low-pH-endosomal cell entry. Relative to BA.4/BA.5, BA.2.75 exhibits reduced evasion of humoral immunity from BA.1/BA.2 breakthrough-infection convalescent plasma but greater evasion of Delta breakthrough-infection convalescent plasma. BA.5 breakthrough-infection plasma also exhibits weaker neutralization against BA.2.75 than BA.5, mainly due to BA.2.75’s distinct neutralizing antibody (NAb) escape pattern. Antibody therapeutics Evusheld and Bebtelovimab remain effective against BA.2.75. These results suggest BA.2.75 may prevail after BA.4/BA.5, and its increased receptor-binding capability could support further immune-evasive mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Plants employ cell-surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize immunogenic patterns and activate defenses. How these receptors regulate immune signaling in the nucleus is not well understood. Our previous studies showed that BIK1, a central kinase associated with PRRs, phosphorylates a plant-specific Gα protein called extra-large G protein 2 (XLG2) to positively regulate immunity. Here, we show that this phosphorylation promotes XLG2 nuclear translocation, which is essential for antibacterial immunity. XLG2 interacts with nuclear-localized MUT9-like kinases (MLKs) to regulate transcriptome programming. MLKs negatively regulate plant immunity in a kinase activity-dependent manner, whereas XLG2 promotes defense gene expression and antibacterial immunity likely by inhibiting MLK kinase activity. A C-terminal motif in MLKs is essential for the interaction with XLG2, and this motif is required for the XLG2-mediated defense activation. Together, our findings reveal a previously unknown pathway and mechanisms by which cell surface receptors regulate transcriptome during pathogen invasion.

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disorder that occurs in the aorta. The inflammatory thickness of the aneurysm wall and perianeurysmal fibrosis are two main causes of AAA pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in these two processes are still unclear. We discovered that C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) and CtBP2 were overexpressed in the aortas of AAA-model mice created by treatment with CaCl2 and elastase. Molecular analyses revealed that the CtBP heterodimer couples with histone acetyltransferase p300 and transcription factor AP1 (activator protein 1) to transactivate a set of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, including MMP1a, 3, 7, 9, and 12) and proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Knockdown of CtBPs or AP1 subunits or blockage of CtBPs with specific small molecule inhibitors significantly suppressed the in vitro expression of MMPs and proinflammatory cytokines. The administration of CtBP inhibitors in AAA-model mice also inhibited MMPs and proinflammatory cytokines, thereby improving the AAA outcome. Taken together, our results revealed a new regulatory mechanism involving MMPs and proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of AAA. This discovery suggests that targeting CtBPs may be a therapeutic strategy for AAA by attenuating the inflammatory response and matrix destruction.

Abstract: Vascular calcification (VC) is closely related to higher cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) switching to osteogenic-like cells is crucial for VC. LncRNA LEF1-AS1 promotes atherosclerosis and dental pulp stem cells calcification, while its role in VC remains unknown. Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) is an adipokine regulating bone metabolism. However, the relationship between vaspin and VC is still unclear. We aimed to explore the role of LEF1-AS1 on VSMC osteogenic transition, whether vaspin inhibited LEF1-AS1-mediated osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs, and the responsible mechanism. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis indicated that LEF1-AS1 overexpression significantly upregulated osteogenic marker Runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) level and downregulated VSMC contractile marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) level. Alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, ALP activity assay, and calcium content assay also suggested that LEF1-AS1 overexpression promoted calcium deposition in VSMCs. However, vaspin treatment abolished this phenomenon. Mechanistically, LEF1-AS1 markedly decreased phosphorylated YAP level, while vaspin reversed LEF1-AS1-induced phosphorylated YAP decline. Our results revealed that LEF1-AS1 accelerated the osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs by regulating the Hippo/YAP pathway, while vaspin eliminated the LEF1-AS1-meditated VSMCs osteogenic phenotype switch.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon analogs show promise as components of next-generation, multi-target, anti-obesity therapeutics. The biology of chronic glucagon treatment, in particular, its ability to induce energy expenditure and weight loss, remains poorly understood. Using a long-acting glucagon analog, G108, we demonstrate that glucagon-mediated body weight loss is intrinsically linked to the hypoaminoacidemia associated with its known amino acid catabolic action. Mechanistic studies reveal an energy-consuming response to low plasma amino acids in G108-treated mice, prevented by dietary amino acid supplementation and mimicked by a rationally designed low amino acid diet. Therefore, low plasma amino acids are a pre-requisite for G108-mediated energy expenditure and weight loss. However, preventing hypoaminoacidemia with additional dietary protein does not affect the ability of G108 to improve glycemia or hepatic steatosis in obese mice. These studies provide a mechanism for glucagon-mediated weight loss and confirm the hepatic glucagon receptor as an attractive molecular target for metabolic disease therapeutics.

Abstract: Defective DNA damage repair is a key mechanism affecting tumor susceptibility, treatment response, and survival outcome of endometrial cancer (EC). Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2) is the core component of the Fanconi anemia repair pathway. To explore the function of FANCD2 in EC, we examined the expression of FANCD2 in human specimens and databases, and discussed the possible mechanism of carcinogenesis by in vitro assays. Immunohistochemistry results showed overexpression of FANCD2 was detected in EC tissues compared to normal and atypical hyperplasia endometrium. Higher FANCD2 expression was correlated with deeper myometrial invasion (MI) and proficient mismatch repair status. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analysis showed FANCD2 was upregulated in EC compared with normal tissue. The high expression of FANCD2 was associated with poor overall survival in EC. Knockdown of FANCD2 expression in EC cell lines inhibited malignant proliferation and migration ability. We demonstrated that decreased FANCD2 expression results in increased DNA damage and decreased S-phase cells, leading to a decrease in proliferative capacity in EC cells. Down-regulated FANCD2 confers sensitivity of EC cells to interstrand crosslinking agents. This study provides evidence for the malignant progression and prognostic value of FANCD2 in EC.

Abstract: Summary
Over 90% of pancreatic cancers present mutations in KRAS, one of the most common oncogenic drivers overall. Currently, most KRAS mutant isoforms cannot be targeted directly. Moreover, targeting single RAS downstream effectors induces adaptive resistance mechanisms. We report here on the combined inhibition of SHP2, upstream of KRAS, using the allosteric inhibitor RMC-4550 and of ERK, downstream of KRAS, using LY3214996. This combination shows synergistic anti-cancer activity in vitro, superior disruption of the MAPK pathway, and increased apoptosis induction compared with single-agent treatments. In vivo, we demonstrate good tolerability and efficacy of the combination, with significant tumor regression in multiple pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse models. Finally, we show evidence that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to assess early drug responses in animal models. Based on these results, we will investigate this drug combination in the SHP2 and ERK inhibition in pancreatic cancer (SHERPA; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04916236) clinical trial, enrolling patients with KRAS-mutant PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Protein display technologies link proteins to distinct nucleic acid sequences (barcodes), enabling multiplexed protein assays via DNA sequencing. Here, we develop Cas9 display (CasPlay) to interrogate customized peptide libraries fused to catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) by sequencing the guide RNA (gRNA) barcodes associated with each peptide. We first confirm the ability of CasPlay to characterize antibody epitopes by recovering a known binding motif for a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. We then use a CasPlay library tiling the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteome to evaluate vaccine-induced antibody reactivities. Using a peptide library representing the human virome, we demonstrate the ability of CasPlay to identify epitopes across many viruses from microliters of patient serum. Our results suggest that CasPlay is a viable strategy for customized protein interaction studies from highly complex libraries and could provide an alternative to phage display technologies.

Abstract: Loss of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) has been found to slow the progression of diabetes and diabetic angiopathy. In our study, we found bidirectional regulation of PARP-1 in high glucose induced endothelial injury, which promoting repair at the early stage of injury and inhibiting repair at the late stage of injury. To further investigate the mechanism of PARP-1 regulation, we first examined the expression of PARP-1 in aortic tissues and cultured cells at early, middle, and late stages of injury, PARP-1 expression was significantly greater than that of control group. Overexpression of PARP-1 in HUVECs significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells 12 h after high glucose injury, while reducing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/malondialdehyde (MDA)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), increasing the level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS); however, when the injury extended to 3 days, the number of apoptosis in HUVECs overexpressing PARP-1 was significantly higher than that in the injury group, and the level of ROS/MDA/iNOS was significantly higher, while the secretion of eNOS was significantly lower. Similarly, PARP-1 inhibitors aggravate early damage and inhibit late damage. We found that PARP-1 promoted the activation of P53 and P53R2 in endothelial cells after 12 h of injury, and PARP-1 promoted the activation of P53 and caspas3 in endothelial cells after 3 days of injury. Therefore, we suggest that PARP-1 plays a dual regulatory role in promoting repair or aggravating injury.

Abstract: Summary
Usher syndrome-associated retinitis pigmentosa (RP) causes progressive retinal degeneration, which has no cure. The pathomechanism of Usher type 1B (USH1B)-RP caused by MYO7A mutation remains elusive because of the lack of faithful animal models and limited knowledge of MYO7A function. Here, we analyzed 3D retinal organoids generated from USH1B patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Increased differential gene expression occurred over time without excessive photoreceptor cell death in USH1B organoids compared with controls. Dysregulated genes were enriched first for mitochondrial functions and then proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes and RNA splicing. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed MYO7A expression in rod photoreceptor and Müller glial cells corresponding to upregulation of stress responses in NRL+ rods and apoptotic signaling pathways in VIM+ Müller cells, pointing to the defensive mechanisms that mitigate photoreceptor cell death. This first human model for USH1B-RP provides a representation of patient retina in vivo relevant for development of therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Gene therapy is emerging as a modality in 21st-century medicine. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene transfer is a leading technology to achieve efficient and durable expression of a therapeutic transgene. However, the structural complexity of the capsid has constrained efforts to engineer the particle toward improved clinical safety and efficacy. Here, we generate a curated library of barcoded AAVs with mutations across a variety of functionally relevant motifs. We then screen this library in vitro and in vivo in mice and nonhuman primates, enabling a broad, multiparametric assessment of every vector within the library. Among the results, we note a single residue that modulates liver transduction across all interrogated models while preserving transduction in heart and skeletal muscles. Moreover, we find that this mutation can be grafted into AAV9 and leads to profound liver detargeting while retaining muscle transduction—a finding potentially relevant to preventing hepatoxicities seen in clinical studies.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 spread in humans results in continuous emergence of new variants, highlighting the need for vaccines with broad-spectrum antigenic coverage. Using inter-lineage chimera and mutation-patch strategies, we engineered a recombinant monomeric spike variant (STFK1628x) that contains key regions and residues across multiple SAR-CoV-2 variants. STFK1628x demonstrated high immunogenicity and mutually complementary antigenicity to its prototypic form (STFK). In hamsters, a bivalent vaccine composed of STFK and STFK1628x elicited high titers of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies to 19 circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron sublineages BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, and BA.4/5. Furthermore, this vaccine conferred robust protection against intranasal challenges by either SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain or immune-evasive Beta and Omicron BA.1. Strikingly, vaccination with the bivalent vaccine in hamsters effectively blocked within-cage virus transmission of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Beta variant, and Omicron BA.1 to unvaccinated sentinels. Thus, our study provided insight and antigen candidates for the development of next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Upon pathogen detection, macrophages normally stay sessile in tissues while dendritic cells (DCs) migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues. The obligate intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii exploits the trafficking of mononuclear phagocytes for dissemination via unclear mechanisms. We report that, upon T. gondii infection, macrophages initiate the expression of transcription factors normally attributed to DCs, upregulate CCR7 expression with a chemotactic response, and perform systemic migration when adoptively transferred into mice. We show that parasite effector GRA28, released by the MYR1 secretory pathway, cooperates with host chromatin remodelers in the host cell nucleus to drive the chemotactic migration of parasitized macrophages. During in vivo challenge studies, bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with wild-type T. gondii outcompeted those challenged with MYR1- or GRA28-deficient strains in migrating and reaching secondary organs. This work reveals how an intracellular parasite hijacks chemotaxis in phagocytes and highlights a remarkable migratory plasticity in differentiated cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental and genetic factors cause defects in pancreatic islets driving type 2 diabetes (T2D) together with the progression of multi-tissue insulin resistance. Mass spectrometry proteomics on samples from five key metabolic tissues of a cross-sectional cohort of 43 multi-organ donors provides deep coverage of their proteomes. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology terms provides a tissue-specific map of altered biological processes across healthy, prediabetes (PD), and T2D subjects. We find widespread alterations in several relevant biological pathways, including increase in hemostasis in pancreatic islets of PD, increase in the complement cascade in liver and pancreatic islets of PD, and elevation in cholesterol biosynthesis in liver of T2D. Our findings point to inflammatory, immune, and vascular alterations in pancreatic islets in PD that are hypotheses to be tested for potential contributions to hormonal perturbations such as impaired insulin and increased glucagon production. This multi-tissue proteomic map suggests tissue-specific metabolic dysregulations in T2D.

Abstract: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play a vital role in the metastasis and recurrence of breast cancer. CTCs are highly heterogeneous at the stage of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), but the phenotypic and biological characteristics in different EMT stages remain poorly defined. We conducted an orthotopic mouse (4T1) model of breast cancer to isolate CTCs and identified two phenotypes of CTCs: intermediate E/M and mesenchymal CTCs. MTT, Colony formation, Transwell migration and invasion assays were utilized to examined cell proliferation, colony forming, migration and invasion ability. Both the intermediate E/M and mesenchymal CTCs exhibited lower rates of proliferation, colony formation and invasion, as compared to primary tumor cells. The mesenchymal CTCs had a higher rate of invasion but lower rates of proliferation and colony formation than the intermediate E/M CTCs. They also exhibited lower rates of growth and metastasis than the primary tumor cells in vivo, but the mesenchymal CTCs had a higher rate of metastasis than the intermediate E/M CTCs. Fluid shear stress induced the EMT transition of CTCs. The comprehensive analysis of CTCs proteomics discovered proteins that differentially expressed in the two types of CTCs and their primary tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor heterogeneity is a major challenge for oncology drug discovery and development. Understanding of the spatial tumor landscape is key to identifying new targets and impactful model systems. Here, we test the utility of spatial transcriptomics (ST) for oncology discovery by profiling 40 tissue sections and 80,024 capture spots across a diverse set of tissue types, sample formats, and RNA capture chemistries. We verify the accuracy and fidelity of ST by leveraging matched pathology analysis, which provides a ground truth for tissue section composition. We then use spatial data to demonstrate the capture of key tumor depth features, identifying hypoxia, necrosis, vasculature, and extracellular matrix variation. We also leverage spatial context to identify relative cell-type locations showing the anti-correlation of tumor and immune cells in syngeneic cancer models. Lastly, we demonstrate target identification approaches in clinical pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples, highlighting tumor intrinsic biomarkers and paracrine signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Ideal therapies for regenerative medicine or healthy aging require healthy organ growth and rejuvenation, but no organ-level approach is currently available. Using Mycobacterium leprae (ML) with natural partial cellular reprogramming capacity and its animal host nine-banded armadillos, we present an evolutionarily refined model of adult liver growth and regeneration. In infected armadillos, ML reprogram the entire liver and significantly increase total liver/body weight ratio by increasing healthy liver lobules, including hepatocyte proliferation and proportionate expansion of vasculature, and biliary systems. ML-infected livers are microarchitecturally and functionally normal without damage, fibrosis, or tumorigenesis. Bacteria-induced reprogramming reactivates liver progenitor/developmental/fetal genes and upregulates growth-, metabolism-, and anti-aging-associated markers with minimal change in senescence and tumorigenic genes, suggesting bacterial hijacking of homeostatic, regeneration pathways to promote de novo organogenesis. This may facilitate the unraveling of endogenous pathways that effectively and safely re-engage liver organ growth, with broad therapeutic implications including organ regeneration and rejuvenation.

Abstract: Oxidative stress–induced excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue is considered the major pathological procedure of glaucoma. This study aimed to explore the role and regulatory mechanism of pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) in H2O2-induced human trabecular meshwork cells (HTMCs). Expressions of PBX1, NANOG, ECM, and pathway-related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis of HTMCs were measured using CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and L-glutathione (GSH) levels were detected to evaluate oxidative stress. Through luciferase reporter assay, the association between PBX1 and NANOG was verified. Results presented that PBX1 was significantly upregulated in H2O2-induced HTMCs. Functionally, PBX1 and NANOG promoted cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and ECM deposition, suppressed ROS accumulation, and enhanced the productions of SOD and GSH in H2O2-stimulated HTMCs, while PBX1 inhibition showed the opposite effects. In addition, PBX1 promoted the transcription of NANOG by upregulating the promoter activity of NANOG which activated the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. What’s more, the inhibitions of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway or NANOG reversed the protective effect of PBX1 on H2O2-stimulated HTMCs. In summary, our study firstly revealed that PBX1 attenuated the oxidative damage in HTMCs via regulating NANOG-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling, suggesting that PBX1 might be a potential treatment target for glaucoma patients.

Abstract: Summary
Harnessing innate immunity is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach in cancer. We report here the design of tetraspecific molecules engaging natural killer (NK) cell-activating receptors NKp46 and CD16a, the β-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), and a tumor-associated antigen (TAA). In vitro, these tetraspecific antibody-based natural killer cell engager therapeutics (ANKETs) induce a preferential activation and proliferation of NK cells, and the binding to the targeted TAA triggers NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine and chemokine production. In vivo, tetraspecific ANKETs induce NK cell proliferation and their accumulation at the tumor bed, as well as the control of local and disseminated tumors. Treatment of non-human primates with CD20-directed tetraspecific ANKET leads to CD20+ circulating B cell depletion, with minimal systemic cytokine release and no sign of toxicity. Tetraspecific ANKETs, thus, constitute a technological platform for harnessing NK cells as next-generation cancer immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Parathyroid diseases are characterized by dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and alterations in parathyroid hormone (PTH) excretion. The development of parathyroid-targeted treatment and imaging tracers could benefit from in vitro models. Therefore, we aim to establish a patient-derived parathyroid organoid model representing human parathyroid tissue. Hyperplastic parathyroid tissue was dispersed, and parathyroid organoids (PTOs) were cultured and characterized. PTO-derived cells exhibited self-renewal over several passages, indicative of the presence of putative stem cells. Immunofluorescence and RNA sequencing confirmed that PTOs phenocopy hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Exposure of PTOs to increasing calcium concentrations and PTH-lowering drugs resulted in significantly reduced PTH excretion. PTOs showed specific binding of the imaging tracers 11C-methionine and 99mTc-sestamibi. These data show the functionality of PTOs resembling the parathyroid. This PTO model recapitulates the originating tissue on gene and protein expression and functionality, paving the way for future physiology studies and therapeutic target and tracer discovery.

Abstract: Summary
We describe methodology for joint reconstruction of physiological-survival networks from observational data capable of identifying key survival-associated variables, inferring a minimal physiological network structure, and bridging this network to the Gompertzian survival layer. Using synthetic network structures, we show that the method is capable of identifying aging variables in cohorts as small as 5,000 participants. Applying the methodology to the observational human cohort, we find that interleukin-6, vascular calcification, and red-blood distribution width are strong predictors of baseline fitness. More important, we find that red blood cell counts, kidney function, and phosphate level are directly linked to the Gompertzian aging rate. Our model therefore enables discovery of processes directly linked to the aging rate of our species. We further show that this epidemiological framework can be applied as a causal inference engine to simulate the effects of interventions on physiology and longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells and type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) are populations of non-T, non-B lymphocytes in peripheral tissues. Although NK and ILC1 subsets have been described, their identification and characteristics remain unclear. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and CITE-seq to explore NK and ILC1 heterogeneity between tissues. We observed that although NK1 and NK2 subsets are conserved in spleen and liver, ILC1s are heterogeneous across tissues. We identified sets of genes expressed by related subsets or characterizing unique ILC1 populations in each organ. The syndecan-4 appeared as a marker discriminating murine ILC1 from NK cells across organs. Finally, we revealed that the expressions of EOMES, GZMA, IRF8, JAK1, NKG7, PLEK, PRF1, and ZEB2 define NK cells and that IL7R, LTB, and RGS1 differentiate ILC1s from NK cells in mice and humans. Our data constitute an important resource to improve our understanding of NK-ILC1 origin, phenotype, and biology.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial anti-phage systems are frequently clustered in microbial genomes, forming defense islands. This property enabled the recent discovery of multiple defense systems based on their genomic co-localization with known systems, but the full arsenal of anti-phage mechanisms remains unknown. We report the discovery of 21 defense systems that protect bacteria from phages, based on computational genomic analyses and phage-infection experiments. We identified multiple systems with domains involved in eukaryotic antiviral immunity, including those homologous to the ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein, dynamin-like domains, and SEFIR domains, and show their participation in bacterial defenses. Additional systems include domains predicted to manipulate DNA and RNA molecules, alongside toxin-antitoxin systems shown here to function in anti-phage defense. These systems are widely distributed in microbial genomes, and in some bacteria, they form a considerable fraction of the immune arsenal. Our data substantially expand the inventory of defense systems utilized by bacteria to counteract phage infection.

Abstract: Rack1 features seven WD40 repeats that fold into a multifaceted scaffold used to build signaling complexes in a context-dependent manner. Previous in vitro studies have revealed associations between Rack1 and many other proteins. Rack 1 is required for establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) in zebrafish and Xenopus. However, any molecular role of Rack1 in protein complexes or polarity regulation remains unclear. Here, we show that Rack1 is an essential gene in mice. Conditional knockout of Rack1 shortened the cochlear duct and induced cellular patterning defects characteristic of defective convergent extension (this PCP process is mediated by cellular junctional remodeling in the developing cochlear epithelium). Also, cochlear hair cells were no longer uniformly oriented in Rack1 conditional knockout mutants. Rack1 was enriched in the cellular cortices of sensory hair cells. In Rack1-deficient cochleae, E-cadherin expression at the cellular boundaries was greatly reduced. Together, the findings reveal a molecular role of Rack1 in PCP signaling that likely involves modulation of E-cadherin levels at the adherens junctions of the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Hip fracture is the clinically most important fracture, but the genetic architecture of hip fracture is unclear. Here, we perform a large-scale hip fracture genome-wide association study meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization study using five cohorts from European biobanks. The results show that five genetic signals associate with hip fractures. Among these, one signal associates with falls, but not with bone mineral density (BMD), while four signals are in loci known to be involved in bone biology. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate a strong causal effect of decreased femoral neck BMD and moderate causal effects of Alzheimer’s disease and having ever smoked regularly on risk of hip fractures. The substantial causal effect of decreased femoral neck BMD on hip fractures in both young and old subjects and in both men and women supports the use of change in femoral neck BMD as a surrogate outcome for hip fractures in clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
The human distal small intestine (ileum) has a distinct microbiota, but human studies investigating its composition and function have been limited by the inaccessibility of the ileum without purging and/or deep intubation. We investigated inherent instability, temporal dynamics, and the contribution of fed and fasted states using stoma samples from cured colorectal cancer patients as a non-invasive access route to the otherwise inaccessible small and large intestines. Sequential sampling of the ileum before and after stoma formation indicated that ileostoma microbiotas represented that of the intact small intestine. Ileal and colonic stoma microbiotas were confirmed as distinct, and two types of instability in ileal host-microbial relationships were observed: inter-digestive purging followed by the rapid postprandial blooming of bacterial biomass and sub-strain appearance and disappearance within individual taxa after feeding. In contrast to the relative stability of colonic microbiota, the human small intestinal microbiota biomass and its sub-strain composition can be highly dynamic.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between the enteric nervous system (ENS) and intestinal epithelium are thought to play a vital role in intestinal homeostasis. How the ENS monitors the frontier with commensal and pathogenic microbes while maintaining epithelial function remains unclear. Here, by combining subdiaphragmatic vagotomy with transcriptomics, chemogenetic strategy, and coculture of enteric neuron-intestinal organoid, we show that enteric neurons expressing VIP shape the α1,2-fucosylation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Mechanistically, neuropeptide VIP activates fut2 expression via the Erk1/2-c-Fos pathway through the VIPR1 receptor on IECs. We further demonstrate that perturbation of enteric neurons leads to gut dysbiosis through α1,2-fucosylation in the steady state and results in increased susceptibility to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). This was attributed to an imbalance between beneficial Bifidobacterium and opportunistic pathogenic Enterococcus faecalis in ALD. In addition, Bifidobacterium α1,2-fucosidase may promote Bifidobacterium adhesion to the mucosal surface, which restricts Enterococcus faecalis overgrowth and prevents ALD progression.

Abstract: Summary
The conclusive identity of Wnts regulating liver zonation (LZ) and regeneration (LR) remains unclear despite an undisputed role of β-catenin. Using single-cell analysis, we identified a conserved Wnt2 and Wnt9b expression in endothelial cells (ECs) in zone 3. EC-elimination of Wnt2 and Wnt9b led to both loss of β-catenin targets in zone 3, and re-appearance of zone 1 genes in zone 3, unraveling dynamicity in the LZ process. Impaired LR observed in the knockouts phenocopied models of defective hepatic Wnt signaling. Administration of a tetravalent antibody to activate Wnt signaling rescued LZ and LR in the knockouts and induced zone 3 gene expression and LR in controls. Administration of the agonist also promoted LR in acetaminophen overdose acute liver failure (ALF) fulfilling an unmet clinical need. Overall, we report an unequivocal role of EC-Wnt2 and Wnt9b in LZ and LR and show the role of Wnt activators as regenerative therapy for ALF.

Abstract: The global trade in used vehicles and their components generates huge financial benefits but leads to detrimental environmental consequences including groundwater pollution and potential adverse health effects mediated by free-radical processes such as lipid peroxidation. We investigated oxidative stress responses in thirty-six, female mice orally exposed (via drinking) to graded concentrations (0%, 50%, and 100%) of groundwater from a well located within a major automobile junk market in SW-Nigeria containing extremely high levels of arsenic (0.332±0.089 mg/l) and seventeen PAHs, which serves as domestic water supply. Blood samples from the mice were assayed for selected biochemical parameters at intervals of 7, 14, and 28 days. A significant dose- and duration-dependent increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) confirmed oxidative stress onset due to exposure to the polluted well-water, while a significant decline in nitric oxide (NO−) levels may suggest impaired endothelial smooth-muscle relaxation which may lead to the development of metabolic diseases over time. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH) showed a contrasting trend with Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), while Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) declined significantly by the 28th day. Two clusters were identified by principal component analysis—one involving MDA, SOD, and GSH suggesting that antioxidant responses driven mainly by SOD and GSH proved insufficient in scavenging the free radicals generated by lipid peroxidation. NO− and total protein clustered together possibly due to the significant declines in both over the study period. Histological examination of liver tissue of exposed mice corroborated the above findings and highlights the need for urgent remedial action.

Differential glycosylation of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase in mesenchymal stromal cells differentiated into either an osteoblastic or adipocytic phenotype,

Abstract: It has long been known that tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is essential for the correct formation of bone, as altered expression or function of this enzyme results in hypophosphatasia, a disease characterised by compromised bone structure, density and strength. However, recent evidence strongly suggests that the enzyme also has a role in lipid accrual and adipogenesis, a function that seems far removed from bone formation. Given that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are progenitors of both osteoblasts and adipocytes, the question arises of how TNAP is regulated to potentially have a different function when MSCs undergo either osteogenesis or adipogenesis. As the primary protein sequence is unchanged for the enzyme during both types of differentiation, any differences in function must be attributed to post-translational modification and/or localisation. We therefore examined the location of TNAP in bone- or adipose-derived MSCs differentiated into an adipocytic phenotype and compared the glycosylation state of the enzyme in MSCs differentiated into either osteoblasts or adipocytes. TNAP was found to co-locate with perilipin around lipid droplets in MSCs from bone, subcutaneous- and visceral adipose tissue during adipocytic differentiation. Treatment of TNAP with wheat germ lectin followed by electrophoresis showed minor differences in glycosylation between the phosphatase isolated from cells from these tissues, whereas electrophoresis after neuraminidase digestion highlighted differential glycosylation between cell types and during adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. This infers that post-translational modification of TNAP is altered during differentiation and is dependent on the eventual phenotype of the cells.

Abstract: Summary
The development of intelligent blood coagulation diagnoses is awaited to meet the current need for large clinical time-sensitive caseloads due to its efficient and automated diagnoses. Herein, a method is reported and validated to realize it through artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted optical clotting biophysics (OCB) properties identification. The image differential calculation is used for precise acquisition of OCB properties with elimination of initial differences, and the strategy of space-time regulation allows on-demand space time OCB properties identification and enables diverse blood function diagnoses. The integrated applications of smartphones and cloud computing offer a user-friendly automated analysis for accurate and convenient diagnoses. The prospective assays of clinical cases (n = 41) show that the system realizes 97.6%, 95.1%, and 100% accuracy for coagulation factors, fibrinogen function, and comprehensive blood coagulation diagnoses, respectively. This method should enable more low-cost and convenient diagnoses and provide a path for potential diagnostic-markers finding.

Abstract: Prostaglandin metabolism is involved in the regulation of the periodic process of hair follicles. Preliminary research data reported that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exhibits potential in hair growth. However, the relevant evidence is still insufficient. Herein, we prepared a PGE2 matrix by conjugating PGE2 with collagen via crosslinkers to avoid rapid degradation of PGE2 molecules in vivo. First, we measured the physical properties of the PGE2 matrix. A mouse model of hair loss was established, and PGE2 matrix subcutaneous injection was applied to evaluate hair growth. Under different treatments with the PGE2 matrix, the morphology of hair follicles, the dynamic expression of hair follicle stem cell markers and key regulators in the hair growth cycle were explored. Our data revealed that the PGE2 matrix increased the proportion of developing hair follicles at the early growth stage. Improvements in hair follicle stem cells, such as Sox9+ and Lgr5+ cells, have also been confirmed as therapeutic effects of PGE2 to stimulate hair follicle growth. Our study indicated that PGE2 exhibits effective roles in hair development during anagen. Furthermore, the results also highlight the potential of the PGE2 delivery system as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hair disorders in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are critical modulators of HIV transmission and disease. Recent evidence suggests a loss of NK cell cytotoxicity during aging, yet analysis of NK cell biology and aging in people with HIV (PWH) is lacking. Herein, we perform comprehensive analyses of people aging with and without HIV to determine age-related NK phenotypic changes. Utilizing high-dimensional flow cytometry, we analyze 30 immune-related proteins on peripheral NK cells from healthy donors, PWH with viral suppression, and viremic PWH. NK cell phenotypes are dynamic across aging but change significantly in HIV and on antiretroviral drug therapy (ART). NK cells in healthy aging show increasing ⍺4β7 and decreasing CCR7 expression and a reverse phenomenon in PWH. These HIV-associated trafficking patterns could be due to NK cell recruitment to HIV reservoir formation in lymphoid tissue or failed mucosal signaling in the HIV-infected gut but appear to be tight delineators of age-related NK cell changes.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism governing the transition of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward differentiated cells is only partially understood. To explore this transition, the activity and expression of the ubiquitous phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3Kα and PI3Kβ) were modulated in primed hESCs. The study reports a pathway that dismantles the restraint imposed by the EZH2 polycomb repressor on an essential stemness gene, NODAL, and on transcription factors required to trigger primitive streak formation. The primitive streak is the site where gastrulation begins to give rise to the three embryonic cell layers from which all human tissues derive. The pathway involves a PI3Kβ non-catalytic action that controls nuclear/active RAC1 levels, activation of JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and nuclear β-catenin accumulation. β-Catenin deposition at promoters triggers release of the EZH2 repressor, permitting stemness maintenance (through control of NODAL) and correct differentiation by allowing primitive streak master gene expression. PI3Kβ epigenetic control of EZH2/β-catenin might be modulated to direct stem cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension characterized by the preferential remodeling of the pulmonary venules. Hereditary PVOD is caused by biallelic variants of the EIF2AK4 gene. Three PVOD patients who carried the compound heterozygous variants of EIF2AK4 and two healthy controls were recruited and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The EIF2AK4 c.2965C>T variant (PVOD#1), c.3460A>T variant (PVOD#2), and c.4832_4833insAAAG variant (PVOD#3) were corrected by CRISPR-Cas9 in PVOD-iPSCs to generate isogenic controls and gene-corrected-iPSCs (GC-iPSCs). PVOD-iPSC-endothelial cells (ECs) exhibited a decrease in GCN2 protein and mRNA expression when compared with control and GC-ECs. PVOD-ECs exhibited an abnormal EC phenotype featured by excessive proliferation and angiogenesis. The abnormal phenotype of PVOD-ECs was normalized by protein kinase B inhibitors AZD5363 and MK2206. These findings help elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of PVOD in humans and to identify promising therapeutic drugs for treating the disease.

Abstract: The main danger of cold stress to animals in cold regions is systemic metabolic changes and protein synthesis inhibition. RBM3, an exceptional cold shock protein, is rapidly upregulated in response to hypothermia to resist the adverse effects of cold stress. However, the mechanism of the protective effect and the rapid upregulation of RBM3 remains unclear. O-GlcNAcylation, an atypical O-glycosylation, is precisely regulated only by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) and participates in the signal transduction of multiple cellular stress responses as a “stress and nutrition receptor.” Therefore, our study aimed to explore the mechanism of RBM3 regulating glucose metabolism and promoting survival in skeletal muscle under acute cold exposure. Meanwhile, our study verifies whether O-GlcNAcylation mediated by OGT rapidly upregulates RBM3. The blood and skeletal muscle of mice were collected at the end of cold exposure treatment for 0, 2, and 4 h. Changes in levels of RBM3, AKT, glycolysis apoptosis, and OGT were measured. The results show that acute cold exposure upregulated RBM3, OGT, and AKT phosphorylation and increased energy consumption, which enhanced glycolysis and prevent apoptosis. In the 32°C mild hypothermia model in vitro, overexpression of RBM3 enhanced AKT phosphorylation. Meanwhile, inactivation of AKT by wortmannin resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle under acute cold exposure. In addition, OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of p65 was confirmed in mouse myoblast cell line (C2C12) cells at mild hypothermia. O-GlcNAcylation level affected p65 activity and nuclear translocation. Compared with wild type (WT) mice, RBM3 and p65 phosphorylation were decreased in specific skeletal muscle Ogt (KO) mice, whereas AKT phosphorylation, glycolysis, and apoptosis were increased. Taken together, O-GlcNAcylation of p65 upregulates RBM3 to promote AKT phosphorylation, enhance glucose metabolism, and reduce apoptosis in skeletal muscle of mice under acute cold exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) results in durable response in only a subset of patients. MYC overexpression in LBCL tumors is associated with poor response to treatment. We tested whether an MYC-driven polyamine signature, as a liquid biopsy, is predictive of response to anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy in patients with r/r LBCL. Elevated plasma acetylated polyamines were associated with non-durable response. Concordantly, increased expression of spermidine synthase, a key enzyme that regulates levels of acetylated spermidine, was prognostic for survival in r/r LBCL. A broad metabolite screen identified additional markers that resulted in a 6-marker panel (6MetP) consisting of acetylspermidine, diacetylspermidine, and lysophospholipids, which was validated in an independent set from another institution as predictive of non-durable response to CAR-T therapy. A polyamine centric metabolomics liquid biopsy panel has predictive value for response to CAR-T therapy in r/r LBCL.

Abstract: Summary
Microbiome research needs comprehensive repositories of cultured bacteria from the intestine of mammalian hosts. We expanded the mouse intestinal bacterial collection (www.dsmz.de/miBC) to 212 strains, all publicly available and taxonomically described. This includes strain-level diversity, small-sized bacteria, and previously undescribed taxa (one family, 10 genera, and 39 species). This collection enabled metagenome-educated prediction of synthetic communities (SYNs) that capture key functional differences between microbiomes, notably identifying communities associated with either resistance or susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Additionally, nine species were used to amend the Oligo-Mouse Microbiota (OMM)12 model, yielding the OMM19.1 model. The added strains compensated for phenotype differences between OMM12 and specific pathogen-free mice, including body composition and immune cells in the intestine and associated lymphoid tissues. Ready-to-use OMM stocks are available for future studies. In conclusion, this work improves our knowledge of gut microbiota diversity in mice and enables functional studies via the modular use of isolates.

Abstract: Summary
Overconsumption of carbohydrate-rich food combined with adverse eating patterns contributes to the increasing incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in China. Therefore, we conducted a randomized trial to determine the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD), an 8-h time-restricted eating (TRE) schedule, and their combination on body weight and abdominal fat area (i.e., primary outcomes) and cardiometabolic outcomes in participants with MetS. Compared with baseline, all 3-month treatments significantly reduce body weight and subcutaneous fat area, but only TRE and combination treatment reduce visceral fat area (VFA), fasting blood glucose, uric acid (UA), and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, compared with changes of LCD, TRE and combination treatment further decrease body weight and VFA, while only combination treatment yields more benefits on glycemic control, UA, and dyslipidemia. In conclusion, without change of physical activity, an 8-h TRE with or without LCD can serve as an effective treatment for MetS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04475822).

Abstract: Summary
The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants challenges vaccination strategies. Here, we collected 201 serum samples from persons with a single infection or multiple vaccine exposures, or both. We measured their neutralization titers against 15 natural variants and 7 variants with engineered spike mutations and analyzed antigenic diversity. Antigenic maps of primary infection sera showed that Omicron sublineages BA.2, BA.4/BA.5, and BA.2.12.1 are distinct from BA.1 and more similar to Beta/Gamma/Mu variants. Three mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations increased neutralization of BA.1 more than BA.4/BA.5 or BA.2.12.1. BA.1 post-vaccination infection elicited higher neutralization titers to all variants than three vaccinations alone, although with less neutralization to BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5. Those with BA.1 infection after two or three vaccinations had similar neutralization titer magnitude and antigenic recognition. Accounting for antigenic differences among variants when interpreting neutralization titers can aid the understanding of complex patterns in humoral immunity that informs the selection of future COVID-19 vaccine strains.

Abstract: Summary
Some plant NLR immune receptors are encoded in head-to-head “sensor-executor” pairs that function together. Alleles of the NLR pair CHS3/CSA1 form three clades. The clade 1 sensor CHS3 contains an integrated domain (ID) with homology to regulatory domains, which is lacking in clades 2 and 3. In this study, we defined two cell-death regulatory modes for CHS3/CSA1 pairs. One is mediated by ID domain on clade 1 CHS3, and the other relies on CHS3/CSA1 pairs from all clades detecting perturbation of an associated pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) co-receptor. Our data support the hypothesis that an ancestral Arabidopsis CHS3/CSA1 pair gained a second recognition specificity and regulatory mechanism through ID acquisition while retaining its original specificity as a “guard” against PRR co-receptor perturbation. This likely comes with a cost, since both ID and non-ID alleles of the pair persist in diverse Arabidopsis populations through balancing selection.

Abstract: Summary
Emergence from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been facilitated by the rollout of effective vaccines. Successful vaccines generate high-affinity plasma blasts and long-lived protective memory B cells. Here, we show a requirement for T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and the germinal center reaction for optimal serum antibody and memory B cell formation after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. We found that Tfh cells play an important role in expanding antigen-specific B cells while identifying Tfh-cell-dependent and -independent memory B cell subsets. Upon secondary vaccination, germinal center B cells generated during primary immunizations can be recalled as germinal center B cells again. Likewise, primary immunization GC-Tfh cells can be recalled as either Tfh or Th1 cells, highlighting the pluripotent nature of Tfh cell memory. This study demonstrates that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19-induced germinal centers are a critical source of humoral immunity.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is critical for the initiation of wound repair; however, persistently high levels of ROS can lead to lipid peroxidation in cells and thus affect wound healing. Iron is a transition metal that is an essential component of almost all living cells and organisms. When present in excess in cells and tissues, iron disrupts redox homeostasis and catalyzes the generation of ROS, leading to increased lipid peroxidation. In this study, we found that after treating interfollicular epidermal (IFE) cells with different concentrations of holotransferrin (0 µg/ml, 1 µg/ml, 10 µg/ml, 100 µg/ml, and 1 mg/ml), the intracellular iron content increased, and cell viability and function did not differ significantly among the treatment groups of cells. In addition, the level of lipid peroxidation in IFE cells did not increase following holotransferrin treatment. We speculated that there is a protective mechanism within IFE cells that reduces the occurrence of intracellular lipid peroxidation. We also found that the elevated intracellular iron content of IFE cells was accompanied by elevated ALDH3B1 expression. We investigated the effect of ALDH3B1 on the level of lipid peroxidation in IFE cells and found that elevated ALDH3B1 expression decreased the damage to IFE cells induced by lipid peroxidation. In addition, the NRF2 pathway was found to affect the expression of ALDH3B1, which in turn affected lipid peroxidation in IFE cells. These findings suggest that in IFE cells, activation of the NRF2 pathway can increase the expression of ALDH3B1 and thus reduce the production of intracellular ROS and the occurrence of intracellular lipid peroxidation. Therefore, ALDH3B1 may be a potential target for the treatment of chronic wounds.

Abstract: Mounting evidence indicates that activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) and metabolic reprogramming contribute to cancer cell migration and invasion, but the molecular mechanism of pro-EMT program through a coordinated action of UPR with metabolism has not been defined. In this study, we utilized ER stress-inducing reagent, thapsigargin (TG), to induced pharmacologic ER stress in lung cancer cells. Here. We report that the branch of UPR, IRE1α-XBP1 pathway plays a pivotal role in reprogramming lung cancer cell metabolism. At the molecular level, the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1) is directly induced by XBP1 as a consequence of UPR activation, thus facilitating aerobic glycolysis and lactate production. We also demonstrated that PDK1 serves as a downstream element of UPR activation in induction of Snail and EMT program. In addition, PDK1-induced Snail was dependent on the lactate production derived from metabolic reprogramming. Our findings reveal a critical role of lactate in pro-invasion events and establishes a direct connection between ER-stress and metabolic reprogramming in facilitating cancer cell progression.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that targeting S100A9 reduces pathological inflammation in abdominal sepsis. Herein, we investigated the role of S100A9 in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in septic lung damage. NETs were detected by electron microscopy in the lung and by confocal microscopy in vitro. Stimulation of isolated mouse bone marrow-derived neutrophils with S100A9 triggered formation of NETs. Blocking TLR4 and RAGE reduced S100A9-induced generation of NETs and DNA-histone complexes. Moreover, S100A9 challenge increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bone marrow neutrophils. Co-incubation with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor not only decreased ROS formation but also attenuated induction of DNA-histone complexes in S100A9-stimulated neutrophils. Abdominal sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in male C57BL/6 mice. Administration of the S100A9 inhibitor ABR-238901 decreased CLP-induced formation of NETs in lungs and DNA-histone complexes in plasma. In addition, transmission electron microscopy revealed that S100A9 was abundantly expressed on NETs in the lungs in CLP mice. By use of intravital microscopy, we found that local injection of NETs increased leukocyte adhesion and migration in the mouse cremaster muscle microvasculature. Notably, treatment with ABR-238901 attenuated NET-induced leukocyte adhesion and extravasation in the cremaster muscle, suggesting that NET-associated S100A9 promotes leukocyte recruitment in vivo. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that S100A9 triggers ROS-dependent formation of NETs via TLR4 and RAGE signaling in neutrophils. Moreover, S100A9 regulates both formation of NETs and NET-induced leukocyte recruitment in vivo. Thus, targeting S100A9 might be useful to ameliorate lung damage in abdominal sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiated cells can be converted into pluripotent stem cells by expressing the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC (OSKM) in a process known as reprogramming. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of pancreas undergoing reprogramming, we identify markers along the trajectory from acinar cell identity to pluripotency. These markers allow direct in situ visualization of cells undergoing dedifferentiation and acquiring features of early and advanced intermediate reprogramming. We also find that a fraction of cells do not dedifferentiate upon OSKM expression and are characterized by stress markers of the REG3 and AP-1 families. Importantly, most markers of intermediate reprogramming in the pancreas are also observed in stomach, colon, and cultured fibroblasts expressing OSKM. Among them is LY6A, a protein characteristic of progenitor cells and generally upregulated during tissue repair. Our roadmap defines intermediate reprogramming states that could be functionally relevant for tissue regeneration and rejuvenation.

Abstract: Summary
A robust method of producing mature T cells from iPSCs is needed to realize their therapeutic potential. NOTCH1 is known to be required for the production of hematopoietic progenitor cells with T cell potential in vivo. Here we identify a critical window during mesodermal differentiation when Notch activation robustly improves access to definitive hematopoietic progenitors with T/NK cell lineage potential. Low-density progenitors on either OP9-hDLL4 feeder cells or hDLL4-coated plates favored T cell maturation into TCRab+CD3+CD8+ cells that express expected T cell markers, upregulate activation markers, and proliferate in response to T cell stimulus. Single-cell RNAseq shows Notch activation yields a 6-fold increase in multi-potent hematopoietic progenitors that follow a developmental trajectory toward T cells with clear similarity to post-natal human thymocytes. We conclude that early mesodermal Notch activation during hematopoietic differentiation is a missing stimulus with broad implications for producing hematopoietic progenitors with definitive characteristics.

Abstract: Summary
The presence of putative stem/progenitor cells has been suggested in adult peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissue, including the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). To date, their identification and fate in pathophysiological conditions have not been addressed. Combining multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches, we identified the presence of stem cells in the adult DRG satellite glial population, and progenitors were present in the DRGs and sciatic nerve. Cell-specific transgenic mouse lines highlighted the proliferative potential of DRG stem cells and progenitors in vitro. DRG stem cells had gliogenic and neurogenic potentials, whereas progenitors were essentially gliogenic. Lineage tracing showed that, under physiological conditions, adult DRG stem cells maintained DRG homeostasis by supplying satellite glia. Under pathological conditions, adult DRG stem cells replaced DRG neurons lost to injury in addition of renewing the satellite glial pool. These novel findings open new avenues for development of therapeutic strategies targeting DRG stem cells for PNS disorders.

Abstract: Summary
3D embryonic stem cell (ESC) aggregates self-organize into embryo-like structures named gastruloids that recapitulate the axial organization of post-implantation embryos. Crucial in this process is the symmetry-breaking event that leads to the emergence of asymmetry and spatially ordered structures from homogeneous cell aggregates. Here, we show that budesonide, a glucocorticoid drug widely used to treat asthma, prevents ESC aggregates to break symmetry. Mechanistically, the effect of budesonide is glucocorticoid receptor independent. RNA sequencing and lineage fate analysis reveal that budesonide counteracts exit from pluripotency and modifies the expression of a large set of genes associated with cell migration, A-P axis formation, and WNT signaling. This correlates with reduced phenotypic and molecular cell heterogeneity, persistence of E-CADHERIN at the cell-cell interface, and cell aggregate compaction. Our findings reveal that cell-cell adhesion properties control symmetry breaking and cell fate transition in 3D gastruloids and suggest a potential adverse effect of budesonide on embryo development.

Abstract: Summary
The recent derivation of human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) from placental cytotrophoblasts and blastocysts opened opportunities for studying the development and function of the human placenta. Recent reports have suggested that human naïve, but not primed, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) retain an exclusive potential to generate TSCs. Here we report that, in the absence of WNT stimulation, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway inhibition leads to direct and robust conversion of primed human PSCs into TSCs. The resulting primed PSC-derived TSC lines exhibit self-renewal, can differentiate into the main trophoblast lineages, and present RNA and epigenetic profiles that are indistinguishable from recently established TSC lines derived from human placenta, blastocysts, or isogenic human naïve PSCs expanded under human enhanced naïve stem cell medium (HENSM) conditions. Activation of nuclear Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling is sufficient for this conversion and necessary for human TSC maintenance. Our findings underscore a residual plasticity in primed human PSCs that allows their in vitro conversion into extra-embryonic trophoblast lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Beyond synthesizing telomere repeats, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) also serves multiple other roles supporting cancer growth. Blocking telomerase to drive telomere erosion appears impractical, but TERT’s non-canonical activities have yet to be fully explored as cancer targets. Here, we used an irreversible TERT inhibitor, NU-1, to examine impacts on resistance to conventional cancer therapies. In vitro, inhibiting TERT sensitized cells to chemotherapy and radiation. NU-1 delayed repair of double-strand breaks, resulting in persistent DNA damage signaling and cellular senescence. Although NU-1 alone did not impact growth of syngeneic CT26 tumors in BALB/c mice, it dramatically enhanced the effects of radiation, leading to immune-dependent tumor elimination. Tumors displayed persistent DNA damage, suppressed proliferation, and increased activated immune infiltrate. Our studies confirm TERT’s role in limiting genotoxic effects of conventional therapy but also implicate TERT as a determinant of immune evasion and therapy resistance.

Abstract: Summary
An increasing number of breast cancer patients develop brain metastases (BM). Standard-of-care treatments are largely inefficient, and breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) patients are considered untreatable. Immunotherapies are not successfully employed in BCBM, in part because breast cancer is a “cold” tumor and also because the brain tissue has a unique immune landscape. Here, we generate and characterize immunocompetent models of BCBM derived from PyMT and Neu mammary tumors to test how harnessing the pro-senescence properties of doxorubicin can be used to prime the specific immune BCBM microenvironment. We reveal that BCBM senescent cells, induced by doxorubicin, trigger the recruitment of PD1-expressing T cells to the brain. Importantly, we demonstrate that induction of senescence with doxorubicin improves the efficacy of immunotherapy with anti-PD1 in BCBM in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner, thereby providing an optimized strategy to introduce immune-based treatments in this lethal disease. In addition, our BCBM models can be used for pre-clinical testing of other therapeutic strategies in the future.

Abstract: Summary
A minority of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) marked by endogenous retrovirus MuERVL are totipotent 2-cell-like cells. However, the majority of ESCs repress MuERVL. Currently, it is still unclear regarding the signaling pathway(s) repressing the MuERVL-associated 2-cell-like state of ESCs. Here, we identify the PIM3-downstream signaling axis as a key route to repress MuERVL and 2-cell-like state. Downregulation, deletion, or inhibition of PIM3 activated MuERVL, 2-cell genes, and trophectodermal genes in ESCs. By screening PIM3-regulated pathways, we discovered AMPK as its key target. The loss of Pim3 caused an increase in AMPK phosphorylation, which phosphorylated HDAC4/5 and triggered their transfer out of the nucleus in Pim3−/− ESCs. The reduction of nuclear HDAC4/5 caused increased H3K9ac and reduced H3K9me1/2 enrichment on MuERVL, thus activating MuERVL and 2-cell-like state. In summary, our study uncovers a novel axis by which PIM3 suppresses 2-cell marker MuERVL and totipotent state in ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Bioluminescent tools can illuminate cellular features in whole organisms. Multi-component tracking remains challenging, though, owing to a lack of well-resolved probes and long imaging times. To address the need for more rapid, quantitative, and multiplexed bioluminescent readouts, we developed an analysis pipeline featuring sequential substrate administration and serial image acquisition. Light output from each luciferin is layered on top of the previous image, with minimal delay between substrate delivery. A MATLAB algorithm was written to analyze bioluminescent images generated from the rapid imaging protocol and deconvolute (i.e., unmix) signals from luciferase-luciferin pairs. Mixtures comprising three to five luciferase reporters were readily distinguished in under 50 min; this same experiment would require days using conventional workflows. We further showed that the algorithm can be used to accurately quantify luciferase levels in heterogeneous mixtures. Based on its speed and versatility, the multiplexed imaging platform will expand the scope of bioluminescence technology.

IL-17 is critical for defense against superficial fungal infections, but the role of this response in invasive disease is less understood. We show that C. albicans secretes a lipase, Lip2, that facilitates invasive disease via lipid-based suppression of the IL-17 response. Lip2 was identified as an essential virulence factor in a forward genetic screen in a mouse model of bloodstream infection. Murine infection with C. albicans strains lacking Lip2 display exaggerated IL-17 responses that lead to fungal clearance from solid organs and host survival. Both IL-17 signaling and lipase activity are required for Lip2-mediated suppression. Lip2 inhibits IL-17 production indirectly by suppressing IL-23 production by tissue-resident dendritic cells. The lipase hydrolysis product, palmitic acid, similarly suppresses dendritic cell activation in vitro. Thus, C. albicans suppresses antifungal IL-17 defense in solid organs by altering the tissue lipid milieu.

Abstract: Summary
The detailed understanding of fibrogenesis has been hampered by a lack of important functional quiescence characteristics and an in vitro model to recapitulate hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. In our study, we establish robust endoderm- and mesoderm-sourced quiescent-like induced HSCs (iHSCs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Notably, iHSCs present features of mature HSCs, including accumulation of vitamin A in the lipid droplets and maintained quiescent features. In addition, iHSCs display a fibrogenic response and secrete collagen I in response to hepatoxicity caused by thioacetamide, acetaminophen, and hepatitis B and C virus infection. Antiviral therapy attenuated virally induced iHSC activation. Interestingly, endoderm- and mesoderm-derived iHSCs showed similar iHSC phenotypes. Therefore, we provide a novel and robust method to efficiently generate functional iHSCs from hESC and iPSC differentiation, which could be used as a model for hepatocyte toxicity prediction, anti-liver-fibrosis drug screening, and viral hepatitis-induced liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Recent technological advances in multi-omics and bioinformatics provide an opportunity to develop precision health assessments, which require big data and relevant bioinformatic methods. Here we collect multi-omics data from 4,277 individuals. We calculate the correlations between pairwise features from cross-sectional data and then generate 11 biological functional modules (BFMs) in males and 12 BFMs in females using a community detection algorithm. Using the features in the BFM associated with cardiometabolic health, carotid plaques can be predicted accurately in an independent dataset. We developed a model by comparing individual data with the health baseline in BFMs to assess health status (BFM-ash). Then we apply the model to chronic patients and modify the BFM-ash model to assess the effects of consuming grape seed extract as a dietary supplement. Finally, anomalous BFMs are identified for each subject. Our BFMs and BFM-ash model have huge prospects for application in precision health assessment.

Abstract: 14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitous adapters combining with phosphorylated serine/threonine motifs to regulate multiple cellular processes. As a negative regulator, 14-3-3 proteins could sequester the phosphorylated YAP1 in cytoplasm to inhibit its activity. In this study, we identified the K50 acetylation (K50ac) of 14-3-3ε protein and investigated its roles and mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma progression. The NAD (+)-dependent protein deacetylases inhibitor, NAM treatment significantly up-regulated the K50ac of 14-3-3ε. K50R mutation resulted in the decrease of K50ac of 14-3-3ε. The K50ac of 14-3-3ε was reversibly mediated by PCAF acetyltransferase and sirt1 deacetylases. K50ac had no obvious effect on the protein stability of 14-3-3ε, but inhibited the combination of 14-3-3ε with phosphorylated YAP1, which resulted in the activation of YAP1 in cholangiocarcinoma. K50R significantly decreased cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation in vitro and the growth of tumor xenograft in vivo compared with WT (wild type) 14-3-3ε. The level of K50ac were higher in cholangiocarcinoma tissues accompanied by the accumulation of YAP1 in nuclear than para-carcinoma tissues. Our study revealed the underlying mechanism of K50ac of 14-3-3ε and its roles in cholangiocarcinoma, providing a potential targeting for cholangiocarcinoma therapy.

Abstract: Proteome imbalance can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation which is associated with pathologies. Protein aggregation can also be an active, organized process and can be exploited by cells as a survival strategy. In adverse conditions, it is beneficial to deposit the proteins in a condensate rather degrading and resynthesizing. Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are biological condensates formed through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), involving cellular components such as nucleic acids and proteins. LLPS is a regulated process, which when perturbed, can undergo a transition from a physiological liquid condensate to pathological solid-like protein aggregates. To understand how the MLO-associated proteins (MLO-APs) behave during aging, we performed a comparative meta-analysis with age-related proteome of C.elegans. We found that the MLO-APs are highly abundant throughout the lifespan in wild-type and long-lived daf-2 mutant animals. Interestingly, they are aggregating more in long-lived mutant animals compared to the age matched wild-type and short-lived daf-16 and hsf-1 mutant animals. GO term analysis revealed that the cell cycle and embryonic development are among the top enriched processes in addition to RNP components in aggregated proteome. Considering antagonistic pleotropic nature of these developmental genes and post mitotic status of C.elegans, we assume that these proteins phase transit during post development. As the organism ages, these MLO-APs either mature to become more insoluble or dissolve in uncontrolled manner. However, in the long-lived daf-2 mutant animals, the MLOs may attain protective states due to extended availability and association of molecular chaperones.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal obesity adversely impacts the in utero metabolic environment, but its effect on fetal hematopoiesis remains incompletely understood. During late development, the fetal bone marrow (FBM) becomes the major site where macrophages and B lymphocytes are produced via differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here, we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of FBM HSPCs at single-cell resolution in fetal macaques exposed to a maternal high-fat Western-style diet (WSD) or a low-fat control diet. We demonstrate that maternal WSD induces a proinflammatory response in FBM HSPCs and fetal macrophages. In addition, maternal WSD consumption suppresses the expression of B cell development genes and decreases the frequency of FBM B cells. Finally, maternal WSD leads to poor engraftment of fetal HSPCs in nonlethally irradiated immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL2rγ−/− mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate for the first time that maternal WSD impairs fetal HSPC differentiation and function in a translationally relevant nonhuman primate model.

Abstract: C2C12 cells are widely used in the muscle field, as they differentiate easily into myotubes and show limited constraints to culture as compared to primary myoblasts. Both C2C12 and primary myoblasts are hard to transfect, which affects downstream experiments. More than 95% of the reports published since 2015 with C2C12 cells have used one gold standard transfectant (i.e., Lipofectamine®), although several studies have suggested less than 30% efficiency of this reagent. In parallel, the capacity of other commercial reagents to transfect muscle cells remains largely unknown. Here, we compared transfection efficiency of five commercial reagents (Lipofectamine® 3000, Viafect™, Fugene® HD, C2C12 Cell Avalanche®, and JetOPTIMUS®) in C2C12 cells. By optimizing DNA:transfectant ratios and cell density, all reagents reached more than 60% transfection efficiency with limited effects on cell growth and viability. GFP-positive myotubes were efficiently generated in cultures transfected with Lipofectamine® 3000, Fugene® HD, C2C12 Cell Avalanche®, and JetOPTIMUS®. Notably, in conditions optimized for DNA transfer in C2C12 cells, these reagents showed low efficiency to transfer siRNA and higher toxicity for primary muscle cells. In conclusion, we reported yet uncharacterized transfection reagents that can serve as a suitable low-cost alternative to the current gold standard in C2C12 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP), a passive polyclonal antibody therapeutic agent, has had mixed clinical results. Although antibody neutralization is the predominant approach to benchmarking CCP efficacy, CCP may also influence the evolution of the endogenous antibody response. Using systems serology to comprehensively profile severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) functional antibodies of hospitalized people with COVID-19 enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of CCP (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04397757), we find that the clinical benefits of CCP are associated with a shift toward reduced inflammatory Spike (S) responses and enhanced nucleocapsid (N) humoral responses. We find that CCP has the greatest clinical benefit in participants with low pre-existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody function and that CCP-induced immunomodulatory Fc glycan profiles and N immunodominant profiles persist for at least 2 months. We highlight a potential mechanism of action of CCP associated with durable immunomodulation, outline optimal patient characteristics for CCP treatment, and provide guidance for development of a different class of COVID-19 hyperinflammation-targeting antibody therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Wastewater surveillance has become essential for monitoring the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater correlates with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caseload in a community. However, estimating the proportions of different SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes has remained technically difficult. We present a phylogenetic imputation method for improving the SARS-CoV-2 reference database and a method for estimating the relative proportions of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes from wastewater samples. The phylogenetic imputation method uses the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and imputes based on the maximum of the posterior probability of each nucleotide. We show that the imputation method has error rates comparable to, or lower than, typical sequencing error rates, which substantially improves the reference database and allows for accurate inferences of haplotype composition. Our method for estimating relative proportions of haplotypes uses an initial step to remove unlikely haplotypes and an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the proportions of different haplotypes in a sample. Using simulations with a reference database of >3 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we show that the estimated proportions reflect the true proportions given sufficiently high sequencing depth.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation of embryonic/induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retina (ESC/iPSC-retina) restores host retinal ganglion cell light responses in end-stage retinal degeneration models with host-graft synapse formation. We studied the immunological features of iPSC-retina transplantation using major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-homozygote monkey iPSC-retinas in monkeys with laser-induced retinal degeneration in MHC-matched and -mismatched transplantation. MHC-mismatched transplantation without immune suppression showed no evident clinical signs of rejection and histologically showed graft maturation without lymphocytic infiltration, although immunological tests using peripheral blood monocytes suggested subclinical rejection in three of four MHC-mismatched monkeys. Although extensive photoreceptor rosette formation was observed on histology, evaluation of functional integration using mouse models such as mouse ESC-retina (C57BL/6) transplanted into rd1(C3H/HeJ, MHC-mismatched model) elicited light responses in the host retinal ganglion cells after transplantation but with less responsiveness than that in rd1-2J mice (C57BL/6, MHC-matched model). These results suggest the reasonable use of ESC/iPSC-retina in MHC-mismatched transplantation, albeit with caution.

Abstract: Summary
3D digital subtraction angiography (DSA) reconstruction from rotational 2D projection X-ray angiography is an important basis for diagnosis and treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). The gold standard requires approximately 133 different projection views for 3D reconstruction. A method to significantly reduce the radiation dosage while ensuring the reconstruction quality is yet to be developed. We propose a self-supervised learning method to realize 3D-DSA reconstruction using ultra-sparse 2D projections. 202 cases (100 from one hospital for training and testing, 102 from two other hospitals for external validation) suspected to be suffering from IAs were conducted to analyze the reconstructed images. Two radiologists scored the reconstructed images from internal and external datasets using eight projections and identified all 82 lesions with high diagnostic confidence. The radiation dosages are approximately 1/16.7 compared with the gold standard method. Our proposed method can help develop a revolutionary 3D-DSA reconstruction method for use in clinic.

Abstract: Summary
The immune synapse is the tight contact zone between a lymphocyte and a cell presenting its cognate antigen. This structure serves as a signaling platform and entails a polarization of intracellular components necessary to the immunological function of the cell. While the surface properties of the presenting cell are known to control the formation of the synapse, their impact on polarization has not yet been studied. Using functional lipid droplets as tunable artificial presenting cells combined with a microfluidic pairing device, we simultaneously observe synchronized synapses and dynamically quantify polarization patterns of individual B cells. By assessing how ligand concentration, surface fluidity, and substrate rigidity impact lysosome polarization, we show that its onset and kinetics depend on the local antigen concentration at the synapse and on substrate rigidity. Our experimental system enables a fine phenotyping of monoclonal cell populations based on their synaptic readout.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2.75 variant emerged in May 2022. BA.2.75 is a BA.2 descendant but is phylogenetically distinct from BA.5, the currently predominant BA.2 descendant. Here, we show that BA.2.75 has a greater effective reproduction number and different immunogenicity profile than BA.5. We determined the sensitivity of BA.2.75 to vaccinee and convalescent sera as well as a panel of clinically available antiviral drugs and antibodies. Antiviral drugs largely retained potency, but antibody sensitivity varied depending on several key BA.2.75-specific substitutions. The BA.2.75 spike exhibited a profoundly higher affinity for its human receptor, ACE2. Additionally, the fusogenicity, growth efficiency in human alveolar epithelial cells, and intrinsic pathogenicity in hamsters of BA.2.75 were greater than those of BA.2. Our multilevel investigations suggest that BA.2.75 acquired virological properties independent of BA.5, and the potential risk of BA.2.75 to global health is greater than that of BA.5.

Abstract: Summary
Biodegraders are targeted protein degradation constructs composed of mini-proteins/peptides linked to E3 ligase receptors. We gained deeper insights into their utility by studying Con1-SPOP, a biodegrader against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an oncology target. Con1-SPOP proved pharmacologically superior to its stoichiometric (non-degrading) inhibitor equivalent (Con1-SPOPmut) as it had more potent anti-proliferative effects and uniquely induced DNA damage, cell apoptosis, and necrosis. Proteomics showed that PCNA degradation gave impaired mitotic division and mitochondria dysfunction, effects not seen with the stoichiometric inhibitor. We further showed that doxycycline-induced Con1-SPOP achieved complete tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Intracellular delivery of mRNA encoding Con1-SPOP via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) depleted endogenous PCNA within hours of application with nanomolar potency. Our results demonstrate the utility of biodegraders as biological tools and highlight target degradation as a more efficacious approach versus stoichiometric inhibition. Once in vivo delivery is optimized, biodegraders may be leveraged as an exciting therapeutic modality.

Abstract: Today, stem cell therapy has been shown to be a remarkable progress and an important application in the regeneration of defective tissues and organs. To deliver stem cells to the injured area, several methods have been proposed such as an intravenous infusion, direct damaged tissue injection, or stem cell sheet transplantation. In this study, we aimed to fabricate a stem cell sheet by culturing human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) on a Col-T scaffold to recover the structure and function of damaged tissues. The results showed that cells reach confluent on the scaffold surface 18 h after seeding. These stem cells were able to survive and proliferate on Col-T scaffold. The average tensile strength of the stem cell sheet was 2.65 MPa. The sheet reached the sterile standards when tested for total bacteria, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus according to Circular number 06/2011/TT-BYT of Vietnam Ministry of Health. In addition, the stem cell sheet was non-toxic when evaluated for exposure toxicity and fluid toxicity according to iSO-10993. Importantly, 5 days after culturing on the Col-T scaffold, the seeded hUC-MSCs were still possessed all properties of MSC such as spindle-shaped, adhesive, could differentiate into mesoderm-derived cells, showed to be CD90, CD105, CD73 positive and CD45, CD34, CD11b, CD19, HLA-DR negative. In summary, our study was successful in creating a stem cell sheet from hUC-MSCs and Col-T scaffold for subsequent in vivo transplantation in the future.

Abstract: Benign tracheobronchial stenosis (BTS) is a fatal and incurable disease. Epithelial repair and matrix reconstruction play an important role in the wound repair process. If the interstitial context is not restored and stabilized in time, it can lead to pathological fibrosis. Here we attempted to identify cytokines that are involved in promoting wound repair. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a cytokine secreted by tracheal epithelial cells, which is indispensable for the growth of epithelial cells and inhibits the overgrowth of fibroblasts. GDF15 can counteract transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ1) stimulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tracheal epithelial cells and inhibit fibroblast activation via the TGFβ1-SMAD2/3 pathway. In a rat model of tracheal stenosis, GDF15 supplementation alleviated the degree of tracheal stenosis. These results suggest that GDF15 prevents fibroblast hyperactivation and promotes epithelial repair in injured trachea. GDF15 may be a potential therapy to improve benign tracheobronchial stenosis.

Abstract: Vascular mimicry (VM) is defined as a vascular channel-like structure composed of tumor cells that correlates with the growth of cancer cells by providing blood circulation. However, whether VM can be formed in dormant cancer cells remains unclear. Our previous research revealed that polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) are specific dormant cells related to the poor prognosis of head and neck cancer. Here, we demonstrated that EBV could promote VM formation by PGCCs in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we revealed that the activation of the ERK pathway partly mediated by LMP2A is responsible for stemness, and the acquisition of the stemness phenotype is crucial to the malignant biological behavior of PGCCs. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process plays a considerable role in PGCCs, and EMT progression is vital for EBV-positive PGCCs to form VM. This is the first study to reveal that EBV creates plasticity in PGCC-VM and provide a new strategy for targeted anti-tumor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Biological sex is a fundamental trait influencing development, reproduction, pathogenesis, and medical treatment outcomes. Modeling sex differences is challenging because of the masking effect of genetic variability and the hurdle of differentiating chromosomal versus hormonal effects. In this work we developed a cellular model to study sex differences in humans. Somatic cells from a mosaic Klinefelter syndrome patient were reprogrammed to generate isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with different sex chromosome complements: 47,XXY/46,XX/46,XY/45,X0. Transcriptional analysis of the hiPSCs revealed novel and known genes and pathways that are sexually dimorphic in the pluripotent state and during early neural development. Female hiPSCs more closely resembled the naive pluripotent state than their male counterparts. Moreover, the system enabled differentiation between the contributions of X versus Y chromosome to these differences. Taken together, isogenic hiPSCs present a novel platform for studying sex differences in humans and bear potential to promote gender-specific medicine in the future.

Abstract: Epileptic seizures occur due to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurosignals. The excitotoxic insults promote the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), unfolded proteins (UFP) aggregation, and sometimes even cell death. The epileptic brain samples in our study showed significant changes in the quantity of UFP accumulation. This part explored the efficiency of ER stress and autophagy responses at neutralizing the UFP using resected epileptic brain tissue samples. Meanwhile, we regularly observed these patients’ post-surgical clinical data to find the recurrence of seizures. According to International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) suggestions, we classified the patients (n = 26) as class 1 (completely seizure-free), class 2 (less frequent seizures or auras), and class 3 (auras with < 3 seizures per year). The classification helped us understand the reason for variations in the UFP accumulation in patient samples. We have observed the protein levels of ER chaperone, glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78/BiP), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), X box-binding protein 1 s (XBP1s), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (peIF2α), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), NADPH oxidase (NOX2), and autophagy proteins like BECLIN1, ATG 7, 12, 5, 16, p62, and LC3. Our results suggested that ER stress response limitation may contribute to seizure recurrence in epilepsy patients, particularly in classes 2 and 3. In addition, we have observed significant upregulation of ER stress-dependent apoptosis initiation factor CHOP in these patients. These results indicate that understanding the ER stress response pattern infers the possibility of post-surgical outcomes in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) patients.

Abstract: Pterygium pathogenesis is often attributed to a population of altered limbal stem cells, which initiate corneal invasion and drive the hyperproliferation and fibrosis associated with the disease. These cells are thought to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and to contribute to subepithelial stromal fibrosis. In this study, the presence of the novel limbal stem cell marker ABCB5 in clusters of basal epithelial pterygium cells co-expressing with P63α and P40 is reported. ABCB5-positive pterygium cells also express EMT-associated fibrosis markers including vimentin and α-SMA while their β-catenin expression is reduced. By using a novel in vitro model of two-dose UV-induced EMT activation on limbal epithelial cells, we could observe the dysregulation of EMT-related proteins including an increase of vimentin and α-SMA as well as downregulation of β-catenin in epithelial cells correlating to downregulation of ABCB5. The sequential irradiation of limbal fibroblasts also induced an increase in vimentin and α-SMA. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time the expression of ABCB5 in pterygium stem cell activity and EMT-related events while the involvement of limbal stem cells in pterygium pathogenesis is exhibited via sequential irradiation of limbal epithelial cells. The later in vitro approach can be used to further study the involvement of limbal epithelium UV-induced EMT in pterygium pathogenesis and help identify novel treatments against pterygium growth and recurrence.

Abstract: MRG domain binding protein (MRGBP) has been proposed to participate in the development of multiple tumors. However, the role of MRGBP in colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains largely unknown. Here, we found that MRGBP expression is significantly elevated in CRC, and that higher MRGBP expression correlates with poorer survival in CRC patients. Experiments in vivo and in vitro indicated that MRGBP promotes CRC cells proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and xenograft tumor growth. Mechanically, for one thing, we discovered that MRGBP suppresses DKK1 expression, thus further activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC cells. For another, MRGBP also enhances acetylation of NF-kB/p65 pathway. Treatment with Wnt/β-catenin and NF-kB pathways inhibitors further confirmed the mediation of these two pathways in MRGBP-promoted CRC cell processes. In conclusion, these findings together suggest that MRGBP promotes CRC progression via DKK1/Wnt/β-catenin and NF-kB/p65 pathways mediated EMT, identifying MRGBP as a promising prognostic and therapeutic target for CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells need a steady supply of nutrients to evade cell death and proliferate. Depriving cancer cells of the amino acid cystine can trigger the non-apoptotic cell death process of ferroptosis. Here, we report that cancer cells can evade cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis by uptake and catabolism of the cysteine-rich extracellular protein albumin. This protective mechanism is enhanced by mTORC1 inhibition and involves albumin degradation in the lysosome, predominantly by cathepsin B (CTSB). CTSB-dependent albumin breakdown followed by export of cystine from the lysosome via the transporter cystinosin fuels the synthesis of glutathione, which suppresses lethal lipid peroxidation. When cancer cells are grown under non-adherent conditions as spheroids, mTORC1 pathway activity is reduced, and albumin supplementation alone affords considerable protection against ferroptosis. These results identify the catabolism of extracellular protein within the lysosome as a mechanism that can inhibit ferroptosis in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Natural resistance to infection is an overlooked outcome after hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure. Between 1977 and 1979, 1,200 Rhesus D-negative Irish women were exposed to HCV-contaminated anti-D immunoglobulin. Here, we investigate why some individuals appear to resist infection despite exposure (exposed seronegative [ESN]). We screen HCV-resistant and -susceptible donors for anti-HCV adaptive immune responses using ELISpots and VirScan to profile antibodies against all know human viruses. We perform standardized ex vivo whole blood stimulation (TruCulture) assays with antiviral ligands and assess antiviral responses using NanoString transcriptomics and Luminex proteomics. We describe an enhanced TLR3-type I interferon response in ESNs compared with seropositive women. We also identify increased inflammatory cytokine production in response to polyIC in ESNs compared with seropositive women. These enhanced responses may have contributed to innate immune protection against HCV infection in our cohort.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is a prominent feature in cancer cells. However, the mechanism underlying malignant behaviors in the state remains unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism of cancer drug resistance through the protein synthesis pathway, downstream of PI3K signaling. An optogenetic tool (named PPAP2) controlling PI3K signaling was developed. Melanoma cells stably expressing PPAP2 (A375-PPAP2) acquired resistance to a cancer drug in the hyperactivation state. Proteome analyses revealed that expression of the antiapoptotic factor tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) was upregulated. TNFAIP8 upregulation was mediated by protein translation from preexisting mRNA. These results suggest that cancer cells escape death via upregulation of TNFAIP8 expression from preexisting mRNA even though alkylating cancer drugs damage DNA.

Abstract: Summary
After injury, a cascade of events repairs the damaged tissue, including expansion and differentiation of the progenitor pool and redeposition of matrix. To guide future wound regeneration strategies, we compared single-cell sequencing of regenerative (third phalangeal element [P3]) and fibrotic (second phalangeal element [P2]) digit tip amputation (DTA) models as well as traumatic heterotopic ossification (HO; aberrant). Analyses point to a common initial response to injury, including expansion of progenitors, redeposition of matrix, and activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and WNT pathways. Surprisingly, fibrotic P2 DTA showed greater transcriptional similarity to HO than to regenerative P3 DTA, suggesting that gene expression more strongly correlates with healing outcome than with injury type or cell origin. Differential analysis and immunostaining revealed altered activation of inflammatory pathways, such as the complement pathway, in the progenitor cells. These data suggests that common pathways are activated in response to damage but are fine tuned within each injury. Modulating these pathways may shift the balance toward regenerative outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Leydig cell failure (LCF) caused by gene mutation results in testosterone deficiency and infertility. Serum testosterone levels can be recovered via testosterone replacement; however, established therapies have shown limited success in restoring fertility. Here, we use a luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotrophin receptor (Lhcgr)-deficient mouse model of LCF to investigate the feasibility of gene therapy for restoring testosterone production and fertility. We screen several adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes and identify AAV8 as an efficient vector to drive exogenous Lhcgr expression in progenitor Leydig cells through interstitial injection. We observe considerable testosterone recovery and Leydig cell maturation after AAV8-Lhcgr treatment in pubertal Lhcgr−/− mice. Of note, this gene therapy partially recovers sexual development, substantially restores spermatogenesis, and effectively produces fertile offspring. Furthermore, these favorable effects can be reproduced in adult Lhcgr−/− mice. Our proof-of-concept experiments in the mouse model demonstrate that AAV-mediated gene therapy may represent a promising therapeutic approach for patients with LCF.

Abstract: Renal fibrosis is a global health concern with limited curative treatment. Canonical transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6), a nonselective cation channel, has been shown to regulate the renal fibrosis in murine models. However, the molecular mechanism is unclear. Fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation is one of the critical steps in the progression of renal fibrosis. In the present study, we demonstrate that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 exposure significantly increases the TRPC6 expression in renal interstitial fibroblast NRK-49F cells. Pharmacological inhibition of TRPC6 and knockdown of Trpc6 by siRNA alleviate TGF-β1-increased expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen I, two key markers of myofibroblasts. Although direct activation of TRPC6 by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) does not affect the expression of α-SMA and collagen I, OAG potentiates TGF-β1-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Further study demonstrates that TGF-β1 exposure increases the phosphorylation level of p38 and Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocation into the nuclei. Inhibition of p38 and YAP decreases TGF-β1-enhanced TRPC6 and α-SMA expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TRPC6 is a key regulator of TGF-β1-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation and provides the mechanism of how TGF-β1 exposure regulates TRPC6 expression in NRK-49F fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of serotonin neurons (SNs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provides a promising platform to explore the mechanisms of serotonin-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. However, neural differentiation always yields heterogeneous cell populations, making it difficult to identify and purify SNs in vitro or track them in vivo following transplantation. Herein, we generated a TPH2-EGFP reporter hPSC line with insertion of EGFP into the endogenous tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) locus using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing technology. This TPH2-reporter, which faithfully indicated TPH2 expression during differentiation, enabled us to obtain purified SNs for subsequent transcriptional analysis and study of pharmacological responses to antidepressants. In addition, the reporter system showed strong EGFP expression to indicate SNs, which enabled us to explore in vitro and ex vivo electrophysiological properties of SNs. In conclusion, this TPH2-EGFP reporter cell line might be of great significance for studies on human SN-related development and differentiation, drug screening, disease modeling, and cell replacement therapies.

Abstract: Aberrant ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) contributes to tumorigeneisis or drug resistance of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Previous studies have implicated the deubiquitinase UCHL5 was abnormally expressed in multiple malignancies. However, little was reported about the specific roles of UCHL5 in PAAD. We aimed to identify the biological roles of UCHL5 in PAAD and demonstrate its prognostic significance. Differential analysis revealed that UCHL5 expressed highly in tumors versus normal tissues, like TCGA-PAAD, GSE28735, GSE15471 and collected samples. Patients with high UCHL5 expressions had worse survival outcomes relative to those with low UCHL5 levels. Experimental assays showed that UCHL5 overexpression could significantly enhance cell proliferation, colony formation and self-renewal capacities. UCHL5 could also promote PAAD migration in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, UCHL5 could directly deubiquitinate and stabilize ELK3 proteins. UCHL5 relied on accumulated ELK3 proteins to drive cell growth, stem-like properties and migration abilities. In addition, enrichment analysis based on RNA-seq data implicated that ELK3 mainly correlated with Notch1 signaling and ELK3 could notably elevate ELK3 mRNA levels. UCHL5 could thus promote self-renewal abilities of PAAD and targeting ELK3 could inhibit the stemness features. In contrast, UCHL5 deficiency could suppress PAAD stemness features, and ectopic expression of ELK3 could rescue this effect. Last of all, we utilized the UCHL5 inhibitor, b-AP15, to treat PAAD cells and found that b-AP15 could inhibit the growth of PAAD cells in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our study uncovered the underlying mechanisms of UCHL5/ELK3/Notch1 axis in PAAD progression and stemness maintaince, shedding light on individualized treatment and risk stratification for PAAD patients.

Abstract: Summary
Given the time and resources invested in clinical trials, innovative prediction methods are needed to decrease late-stage failure in vaccine development. We identify combinations of early innate responses that predict neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses induced in HIV-Env SOSIP immunized cynomolgus macaques using various routes of vaccine injection and adjuvants. We analyze blood myeloid cells before and 24 h after each immunization by mass cytometry using a three-step clustering, and we discriminate unique vaccine signatures based on HLA-DR, CD39, CD86, CD11b, CD45, CD64, CD14, CD32, CD11c, CD123, CD4, CD16, and CADM1 surface expression. Various combinations of these markers characterize cell families positively associated with nAb production, whereas CADM1-expressing cells are negatively associated (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that monitoring immune signatures during early vaccine development could assist in identifying biomarkers that predict vaccine immunogenicity.

Abstract: Esophageal cancer has always been associated with poor prognosis and a low five-year survival rate. Chalcone, a flavonoid family member, has shown anti-tumor property in several types of cancer. However, few studies reported the potency and mechanisms of action of synthetic Chalcone derivatives against esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of novel chalcone analogs and Ch-19 was selected for its superior anti-tumor potency. Results indicated that Ch-19 shows a dose- and time-dependent anti-tumor activity in both KYSE-450 and Eca-109 esophageal cancer cells. Moreover, treatment of Ch-19 resulted in the regression of KYSE-450 tumor xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, we investigated the potential mechanism involved in the effective anti-tumor effects of Ch-19. As a result, we observed that Ch-19 treatment promoted ROS accumulation and caused G2/M phase arrest in both Eca-109 and KYSE-450 cancer cell lines, thereby resulting in cell apoptosis. Taken together, our study provided a novel synthetic chalcone derivative as a potential anti-tumor therapeutic candidate for treating esophageal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial gene expression, achieved classically through in situ hybridization, is a fundamental tool for topographic phenotyping of cell types in the nervous system. Newly developed techniques allow for visualization of multiple mRNAs at single-cell resolution and greatly expand the ability to link gene expression to tissue topography, yet there are challenges in efficient quantification and analysis of these high-dimensional datasets. We have therefore developed the single-cell automated multiplex pipeline for RNA (SCAMPR), facilitating rapid and accurate segmentation of neuronal cell bodies using a dual immunohistochemistry-RNAscope protocol and quantification of low- and high-abundance mRNA signals using open-source image processing and automated segmentation tools. Proof of principle using SCAMPR focused on spatial mapping of gene expression by peripheral (vagal nodose) and central (visual cortex) neurons. The analytical effectiveness of SCAMPR is demonstrated by identifying the impact of early life stress on gene expression in vagal neuron subtypes.

Abstract: Summary
Stargardt retinopathy is an inherited form of macular degeneration caused by mutations in gene ABCA4 and characterized by the accumulation of lipid-rich deposits in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), RPE atrophy, and photoreceptor cell death. Inadequate mechanistic insights into pathophysiological changes occurring in Stargardt RPE have hindered disease treatments. Here, we show that ABCA4 knockout and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (STGD1-iRPE) from patients with Stargardt differentiate normally but display intracellular lipid and ceramide deposits reminiscent of the disease phenotype. STGD1-iRPE also shows defective photoreceptor outer segment (POS) processing and reduced cathepsin B activity—indicating higher lysosomal pH. Lipid deposits in STGD1-iRPE are lowered by increasing the activity of ABCA1, a lipid transporter, and ABCA4 ortholog. Our work suggests that ABCA4 is involved in POS and lipid handling in RPE cells and provides guidance for ongoing gene therapy approaches to target both RPE and photoreceptor cells for an effective treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Despite clinical evidence supporting an association between SLE and CAD, pleiotropy-adjusted genetic association studies are limited and focus on only a few common risk loci. Here, we identify a net positive causal estimate of SLE-associated non-HLA SNPs on CAD by traditional Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches. Pathway analysis using SNP-to-gene mapping followed by unsupervised clustering based on protein-protein interactions (PPIs) identifies biological networks composed of positive and negative causal sets of genes. In addition, we confirm the casual effects of specific SNP-to-gene modules on CAD using only SNP mapping to each PPI-defined functional gene set as instrumental variables. This PPI-based MR approach elucidates various molecular pathways with causal implications between SLE and CAD and identifies biological pathways likely causative of both pathologies, revealing known and novel therapeutic interventions for managing CAD in SLE.

Abstract: Summary
To parallelly compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy (tislelizumab), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin), and neoadjuvant combination therapy (tislelizumab + GC) in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and explore the efficacy predictors, we perform a multi-center, real-world cohort study that enrolls 253 patients treated with neoadjuvant treatments (combination therapy: 98, chemotherapy: 107, and immunotherapy: 48) from 15 tertiary hospitals. We demonstrate that neoadjuvant combination therapy achieves the highest complete response rate and pathological downstaging rate compared with neoadjuvant immunotherapy or chemotherapy. We develop and validate an efficacy prediction model consisting of pretreatment clinical characteristics, which can pinpoint candidates to receive neoadjuvant combination therapy. We also preliminarily reveal that patients who achieve pathological complete response after neoadjuvant treatments plus maximal transurethral resection of the bladder tumor may be safe to receive bladder preservation therapy. Overall, this study highlights the benefit of neoadjuvant combination therapy based on tislelizumab for MIBC.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency requires extensive remodeling of chromatin landscapes to silence existing cell-type-specific genes and activate pluripotency genes. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are important regulators of chromatin structure and gene expression; however, the role of recently identified Bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) and the associated non-canonical BRG1-associated factors (ncBAF) complex in reprogramming remains unknown. Here, we show that genetic or chemical inhibition of BRD9, as well as ncBAF complex subunit GLTSCR1, but not the closely related BRD7, increase human somatic cell reprogramming efficiency and can replace KLF4 and c-MYC. We find that BRD9 is dispensable for human induced pluripotent stem cells under primed but not under naive conditions. Mechanistically, BRD9 inhibition downregulates fibroblast-related genes and decreases chromatin accessibility at somatic enhancers. BRD9 maintains the expression of transcriptional regulators MN1 and ZBTB38, both of which impede reprogramming. Collectively, these results establish BRD9 as an important safeguarding factor for somatic cell identity whose inhibition lowers chromatin-based barriers to reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Unlike mRNA vaccines based only on the spike protein, inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines should induce a diversified T cell response recognizing distinct structural proteins. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in healthy individuals following vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or mRNA vaccines. Relative to spike mRNA vaccination, inactivated vaccines elicit a lower magnitude of spike-specific T cells, but the combination of membrane, nucleoprotein, and spike-specific T cell response is quantitatively comparable with the sole spike T cell response induced by mRNA vaccine, and they efficiently tolerate the mutations characterizing the Omicron lineage. However, this multi-protein-specific T cell response is not mediated by a coordinated CD4 and CD8 T cell expansion but by selective priming of CD4 T cells. These findings can help in understanding the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the efficacy of the different vaccines to control severe COVID-19 after Omicron infection.
