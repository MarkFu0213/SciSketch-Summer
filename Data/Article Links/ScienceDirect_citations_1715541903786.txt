Abstract: Summary
CD8 T cells play a key role in defense against the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma, but why certain CD8 responses are more potent than others is not well understood. Here, we describe a parasite antigen, ROP5, that elicits a CD8 T cell response in genetically susceptible mice. ROP5 is secreted via parasite organelles termed rhoptries that are injected directly into host cells during invasion, whereas the protective, dense-granule antigen GRA6 is constitutively secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole. Transgenic parasites in which the ROP5 antigenic epitope was targeted for secretion through dense granules led to enhanced CD8 T cell responses, whereas targeting the GRA6 epitope to rhoptries led to reduced CD8 responses. CD8 T cell responses to the dense-granule-targeted ROP5 epitope resulted in reduced parasite load in the brain. These data suggest that the mode of secretion affects the efficacy of parasite-specific CD8 T cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial complex I (CI) deficiency is associated with multiple neurological and metabolic disorders. However, its effect on innate immunity and bone remodeling is unclear. Using deletion of the essential CI subunit Ndufs4 as a model for mitochondrial dysfunction, we report that mitochondria suppress macrophage activation and inflammation while promoting osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via both cell-autonomous and systemic regulation. Global Ndufs4 deletion causes systemic inflammation and osteopetrosis. Hematopoietic Ndufs4 deletion causes an intrinsic lineage shift from osteoclast to macrophage. Liver Ndufs4 deletion causes a metabolic shift from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis, accumulating fatty acids and lactate (FA/LAC) in the circulation. FA/LAC further activates Ndufs4−/− macrophages via reactive oxygen species induction and diminishes osteoclast lineage commitment in Ndufs4−/− progenitors; both inflammation and osteopetrosis in Ndufs4−/− mice are attenuated by TLR4/2 deletion. Together, these findings reveal mitochondrial CI as a critical rheostat of innate immunity and skeletal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling networks controlled by Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and the transcription factor Atoh1 regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs). Deregulations in those developmental processes lead to medulloblastoma formation, the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. Although the protein Atoh1 is a key factor during both cerebellar development and medulloblastoma formation, up-to-date detailed mechanisms underlying its function and regulation have remained poorly understood. Here, we report that SHH regulates Atoh1 stability by preventing its phosphodependent degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Huwe1. Our results reveal that SHH and Atoh1 contribute to a positive autoregulatory loop promoting neuronal precursor expansion. Consequently, Huwe1 loss in mouse SHH medulloblastoma illustrates the disruption of this developmental mechanism in cancer. Hence, the crosstalk between SHH signaling and Atoh1 during cerebellar development highlights a collaborative network that could be further targeted in medulloblastoma.

Histone-Fold Domain Protein NF-Y Promotes Chromatin Accessibility for Cell Type-Specific Master Transcription Factors,

Abstract: Summary
Cell type-specific master transcription factors (TFs) play vital roles in defining cell identity and function. However, the roles ubiquitous factors play in the specification of cell identity remain underappreciated. Here we show that the ubiquitous CCAAT-binding NF-Y complex is required for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity and is an essential component of the core pluripotency network. Genome-wide studies in ESCs and neurons reveal that NF-Y regulates not only genes with housekeeping functions through cell type-invariant promoter-proximal binding, but also genes required for cell identity by binding to cell type-specific enhancers with master TFs. Mechanistically, NF-Y’s distinct DNA-binding mode promotes master/pioneer TF binding at enhancers by facilitating a permissive chromatin conformation. Our studies unearth a conceptually unique function for histone-fold domain (HFD) protein NF-Y in promoting chromatin accessibility and suggest that other HFD proteins with analogous structural and DNA-binding properties may function in similar ways.

The Multifunctional Sorting Protein PACS-2 Regulates SIRT1-Mediated Deacetylation of p53 to Modulate p21-Dependent Cell-Cycle Arrest,

Abstract: Summary
SIRT1 regulates the DNA damage response by deacetylating p53, thereby repressing p53 transcriptional output. Here, we demonstrate that the sorting protein PACS-2 regulates SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 to modulate the DNA damage response. PACS-2 knockdown cells failed to efficiently undergo p53-induced cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Accordingly, p53 acetylation was reduced both in PACS-2 knockdown cells and thymocytes from Pacs-2−/− mice, thereby blunting induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A). The SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 or SIRT1 knockdown restored p53 acetylation and p21 induction as well as p21-dependent cell-cycle arrest in PACS-2 knockdown cells. Trafficking studies revealed that cytoplasmic PACS-2 shuttled to the nucleus, where it interacted with SIRT1 and repressed SIRT1-mediated p53 deacetylation. Correspondingly, in vitro assays demonstrated that PACS-2 directly inhibited SIRT1-catalyzed p53 deacetylation. Together, these findings identify PACS-2 as an in vivo mediator of the SIRT1-p53-p21 axis that modulates the DNA damage response.

Ribosome Profiling Reveals Pervasive Translation Outside of Annotated Protein-Coding Genes,

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome profiling suggests that ribosomes occupy many regions of the transcriptome thought to be noncoding, including 5′ UTRs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here, we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: copurification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. We develop a metric for distinguishing between 80S footprints and nonribosomal sources using footprint size distributions, which validates the vast majority of footprints outside of coding regions. We present evidence for polypeptide production beyond annotated genes, including the induction of immune responses following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Translation is pervasive on cytosolic transcripts outside of conserved reading frames, and direct detection of this expanded universe of translated products enables efforts at understanding how cells manage and exploit its consequences.

Serotonergic versus Nonserotonergic Dorsal Raphe Projection Neurons: Differential Participation in Reward Circuitry,

Abstract: Summary
The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contains the largest group of serotonin-producing neurons in the brain and projects to regions controlling reward. Although pharmacological studies suggest that serotonin inhibits reward seeking, electrical stimulation of the DRN strongly reinforces instrumental behavior. Here, we provide a targeted assessment of the behavioral, anatomical, and electrophysiological contributions of serotonergic and nonserotonergic DRN neurons to reward processes. To explore DRN heterogeneity, we used a simultaneous two-vector knockout/optogenetic stimulation strategy, as well as cre-induced and cre-silenced vectors in several cre-expressing transgenic mouse lines. We found that the DRN is capable of reinforcing behavior primarily via nonserotonergic neurons, for which the main projection target is the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Furthermore, these nonserotonergic projections provide glutamatergic excitation of VTA dopamine neurons and account for a large majority of the DRN-VTA pathway. These findings help to resolve apparent discrepancies between the roles of serotonin versus the DRN in behavioral reinforcement.

Autodeubiquitination Protects the Tumor Suppressor BAP1 from Cytoplasmic Sequestration Mediated by the Atypical Ubiquitin Ligase UBE2O,

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor BAP1 interacts with chromatin-associated proteins and regulates cell proliferation, but its mechanism of action and regulation remain poorly defined. We show that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2O multi-monoubiquitinates the nuclear localization signal of BAP1, thereby inducing its cytoplasmic sequestration. This activity is counteracted by BAP1 autodeubiquitination through intramolecular interactions. Significantly, we identified cancer-derived BAP1 mutations that abrogate autodeubiquitination and promote its cytoplasmic retention, indicating that BAP1 autodeubiquitination ensures tumor suppression. The antagonistic relationship between UBE2O and BAP1 is also observed during adipogenesis, whereby UBE2O promotes differentiation and cytoplasmic localization of BAP1. Finally, we established a putative targeting consensus sequence of UBE2O and identified numerous chromatin remodeling factors as potential targets, several of which tested positive for UBE2O-mediated ubiquitination. Thus, UBE2O defines an atypical ubiquitin-signaling pathway that coordinates the function of BAP1 and establishes a paradigm for regulation of nuclear trafficking of chromatin-associated proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Lin28a/b are RNA-binding proteins that influence stem cell maintenance, metabolism, and oncogenesis. Poorly differentiated, aggressive cancers often overexpress Lin28, but its role in tumor initiation or maintenance has not been definitively addressed. We report that LIN28B overexpression is sufficient to initiate hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in murine models. We also detected Lin28b overexpression in MYC-driven hepatoblastomas, and liver-specific deletion of Lin28a/b reduced tumor burden, extended latency, and prolonged survival. Both intravenous siRNA against Lin28b and conditional Lin28b deletion reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival. Igf2bp proteins are upregulated, and Igf2bp3 is required in the context of LIN28B overexpression to promote growth. Therefore, multiple murine models demonstrate that Lin28b is both sufficient to initiate liver cancer and necessary for its maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
A large and diverse set of proteins, including CST complex, nonsense mediated decay (NMD), and DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, play important roles at the telomere in mammals and yeast. Here, we report that NMD, like the DDR, affects single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) production at uncapped telomeres. Remarkably, we find that the requirement for Cdc13, one of the components of CST, can be efficiently bypassed when aspects of DDR and NMD pathways are inactivated. However, identical genetic interventions do not bypass the need for Stn1 and Ten1, the partners of Cdc13. We show that disabling NMD alters the stoichiometry of CST components at telomeres and permits Stn1 to bind telomeres in the absence of Cdc13. Our data support a model that Stn1 and Ten1 can function in a Cdc13-independent manner and have implications for the function of CST components across eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinases (PI3Ks) can produce PtdIns3P to control endocytic trafficking, but whether enzyme specialization occurs in defined subcellular locations is unclear. Here, we report that PI3K-C2α is enriched in the pericentriolar recycling endocytic compartment (PRE) at the base of the primary cilium, where it regulates production of a specific pool of PtdIns3P. Loss of PI3K-C2α-derived PtdIns3P leads to mislocalization of PRE markers such as TfR and Rab11, reduces Rab11 activation, and blocks accumulation of Rab8 at the primary cilium. These changes in turn cause defects in primary cilium elongation, Smo ciliary translocation, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling and ultimately impair embryonic development. Selective reconstitution of PtdIns3P levels in cells lacking PI3K-C2α rescues Rab11 activation, primary cilium length, and Shh pathway induction. Thus, PI3K-C2α regulates the formation of a PtdIns3P pool at the PRE required for Rab11 and Shh pathway activation.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue macrophage (ATM)-driven inflammation plays a key role in insulin resistance; however, factors activating ATMs are poorly understood. Using a proteomics approach, we show that markers of classical activation are absent on ATMs from obese humans but are readily detectable on airway macrophages of patients with cystic fibrosis, a disease associated with chronic bacterial infection. Moreover, treating macrophages with glucose, insulin, and palmitate—conditions characteristic of the metabolic syndrome—produces a “metabolically activated” phenotype distinct from classical activation. Markers of metabolic activation are expressed by proinflammatory ATMs in obese humans/mice and are positively correlated with adiposity. Metabolic activation is driven by independent proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways, which regulate balance between cytokine production and lipid metabolism. We identify PPARγ and p62/SQSTM1 as two key proteins that promote lipid metabolism and limit inflammation in metabolically activated macrophages. Collectively, our data provide important mechanistic insights into pathways that drive the metabolic-disease-specific phenotype of macrophages.

Abstract: Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) is a member of the sorting nexin family of proteins and plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It has a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain which can form a crescent-shaped homodimer structure that induces deformation of the plasma membrane. While other BAR-domain containing proteins such as amphiphysin and endophilin have an amphiphatic helix in front of the BAR domain which plays a critical role in membrane penetration, SNX9 does not. Thus, whether and how SNX9 BAR domain could induce the deformation of the plasma membrane is not clear. The present study identified the internal putative amphiphatic stretch in the 1st α-helix of the SNX9 BAR domain and proved that together with the N-terminal helix (H0) region, this internal putative amphiphatic stretch is critical for inducing membrane tubulation. Therefore, our study shows that SNX9 uses a unique mechanism to induce the tubulation of the plasma membrane which mediates proper membrane deformation during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Class switch recombination (CSR) is a B cell-specific genomic alteration induced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent DNA break at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, followed by repair. Although chromatin-associated factors in promoting AID-induced DNA break have been widely reported, the involvement of chromatin adaptors at the repair phase of CSR remains unknown. Here, we show that the acetylated histone reader Brd4 is critical for nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair of AID- and I-SceI-induced DNA breaks. Brd4 was recruited to the DNA break regions, and its depletion from the chromatin caused CSR impairment without affecting the DNA break generation. Inhibition of Brd4 suppressed the accumulation of 53BP1 and uracil DNA glycosylase at the switch regions, perturbed the switch junctional microhomology, and reduced Igh/c-myc translocation. We conclude that Brd4 serves as a chromatin platform required for the recruitment of repair components during CSR and general DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
We demonstrate that the antibiotic amicoumacin A (AMI) is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. Resistance mutations in helix 24 of the 16S rRNA mapped the AMI binding site to the small ribosomal subunit. The crystal structure of bacterial ribosome in complex with AMI solved at 2.4 Å resolution revealed that the antibiotic makes contacts with universally conserved nucleotides of 16S rRNA in the E site and the mRNA backbone. Simultaneous interactions of AMI with 16S rRNA and mRNA and the in vivo experimental evidence suggest that it may inhibit the progression of the ribosome along mRNA. Consistent with this proposal, binding of AMI interferes with translocation in vitro. The inhibitory action of AMI can be partly compensated by mutations in the translation elongation factor G.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling complexes are key determinants of embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity. Here, we demonstrate that BRD4, a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family of epigenetic readers, regulates the self-renewal ability and pluripotency of ESCs. BRD4 inhibition resulted in induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and commitment to the neuroectodermal lineage while reducing the ESC multidifferentiation capacity in teratoma assays. BRD4 maintains transcription of core stem cell genes such as OCT4 and PRDM14 by occupying their super-enhancers (SEs), large clusters of regulatory elements, and recruiting to them Mediator and CDK9, the catalytic subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), to allow Pol-II-dependent productive elongation. Our study describes a mechanism of regulation of ESC identity that could be applied to improve the efficiency of ESC differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
In animals, key functions of microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) are translational repression and deadenylation followed by mRNA decay. While miRISC represses translation initiation, it is poorly understood how miRISC exerts this function. Here we assessed the effect of miRISC on synergistic recruitment of translation initiation factors to target mRNAs by using direct biochemical assays. We show that miRISC promotes eIF4AI and eIF4AII release from target mRNAs prior to dissociation of eIF4E and eIF4G in a deadenylation-independent manner. Strikingly, miRISC-induced release of eIF4AI and eIF4AII from target mRNAs and miRISC-induced inhibition of cap-dependent translation can both be counteracted by the RNA-binding protein HuD via a direct interaction of HuD with eIF4A. Furthermore, the pharmacological eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol, which locks eIF4A on mRNAs, conferred resistance to miRNA-mediated translational repression. In summary, we propose that both eIF4AI and eIF4AII are functionally important targets in miRISC-mediated translation control.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms underlying tumor VEGF-induced host anemia and bone marrow cell (BMC) mobilization remain unknown. Here, we report that tumor VEGF markedly induced sinusoidal vasculature dilation in bone marrow (BM) and BMC mobilization to tumors and peripheral tissues in mouse and human tumor models. Unexpectedly, anti-VEGFR2, but not anti-VEGFR1, treatment completely blocked VEGF-induced anemia and BMC mobilization. Genetic deletion of Vegfr2 in endothelial cells markedly ablated VEGF-stimulated BMC mobilization. Conversely, deletion of the tyrosine kinase domain from Vegfr1 gene (Vegfr1TK−/−) did not affect VEGF-induced BMC mobilization. Analysis of VEGFR1+/VEGFR2+ populations in peripheral blood and BM showed no significant ratio difference between VEGF- and control tumor-bearing animals. These findings demonstrate that vascular dilation through the VEGFR2 signaling is the mechanism underlying VEGF-induced BM mobilization and anemia. Thus, our data provide mechanistic insights on VEGF-induced BMC mobilization in tumors and have therapeutic implications by targeting VEGFR2 for cancer therapy.

Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant metaplastic change of the esophageal epithelium into columnar epithelium, occurring in patients suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease. Mechanisms behind the development of the intestinal subtype, which is associated with the highest cancer risk, are unclear. In humans, it has been suggested that a nonspecialized columnar metaplasia precedes the development of intestinal metaplasia. Here, we propose that a complex made up of at least two factors needs to be activated simultaneously to drive the expression of intestinal type of genes. Using unique animal models and robust in vitro assays, we show that the nonspecialized columnar metaplasia is a precursor of intestinal metaplasia and that pSMAD/CDX2 interaction is essential for the switch toward an intestinal phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) containing activated BRAF (BRAF[V600E]) have a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) characterized by aberrant hypermethylation of many genes, including the mismatch repair gene MLH1. MLH1 silencing results in microsatellite instability and a hypermutable phenotype. Through an RNAi screen, here we identify the transcriptional repressor MAFG as the pivotal factor required for MLH1 silencing and CIMP in CRCs containing BRAF(V600E). In BRAF-positive human CRC cell lines and tumors, MAFG is bound at the promoters of MLH1 and other CIMP genes, and recruits a corepressor complex that includes its heterodimeric partner BACH1, the chromatin remodeling factor CHD8, and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, resulting in hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. BRAF(V600E) increases BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling resulting in phosphorylation and elevated levels of MAFG, which drives DNA binding. Analysis of transcriptionally silenced CIMP genes in KRAS-positive CRCs indicates that different oncoproteins direct the assembly of distinct repressor complexes on common promoters.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of apicobasal polarity is a hallmark of epithelial pathologies. Leukocyte infiltration and crosstalk with dysfunctional epithelial barriers are crucial for the inflammatory response. Here, we show that apicobasal architecture regulates the adhesion between hepatic epithelial cells and lymphocytes. Polarized hepatocytes and epithelium from bile ducts segregate the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) adhesion receptor onto their apical, microvilli-rich membranes, which are less accessible by circulating immune cells. Upon cell depolarization, hepatic ICAM-1 becomes exposed and increases lymphocyte binding. Polarized hepatic cells prevent ICAM-1 exposure to lymphocytes by redirecting basolateral ICAM-1 to apical domains. Loss of ICAM-1 polarity occurs in human inflammatory liver diseases and can be induced by the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). We propose that adhesion receptor polarization is a parenchymal immune checkpoint that allows functional epithelium to hamper leukocyte binding. This contributes to the haptotactic guidance of leukocytes toward neighboring damaged or chronically inflamed epithelial cells that expose their adhesion machinery.

Phosphorylation of ETS1 by Src Family Kinases Prevents Its Recognition by the COP1 Tumor Suppressor,

Abstract: Summary
Oncoproteins and tumor suppressors antagonistically converge on critical nodes governing neoplastic growth, invasion, and metastasis. We discovered that phosphorylation of the ETS1 and ETS2 transcriptional oncoproteins at specific serine or threonine residues creates binding sites for the COP1 tumor suppressor protein, which is an ubiquitin ligase component, leading to their destruction. In the case of ETS1, however, phosphorylation of a neighboring tyrosine residue by Src family kinases disrupts COP1 binding, thereby stabilizing ETS1. Src-dependent accumulation of ETS1 in breast cancer cells promotes anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. These findings expand the list of potential COP1 substrates to include proteins whose COP1-binding sites are subject to regulatory phosphorylation and provide insights into transformation by Src family kinases.

Abstract: The structure of the kidney and the localization of Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) immunopositive cells were examined throughout the postembryonic development of the Persian sturgeon, Acipenser persicus, from newly hatched prelarvae (10mm) to 20 days post hatch (20 DPH) larvae (31mm). Investigations were conducted through histology and immunohistochemistry by using the light and immunofluorescence microscopy. The pronephros was observed in newly hatched prelarvae. The cells lining the distal pronephric tubules and their collecting ducts showed laterally expressed NKA immunofluorescence that later extended throughout the whole cytoplasm. Mesonephrogenous placodes and pre-glomeruli were distinguished at 2 DPH along the collecting ducts posteriorly. Their tubules were formed and present in kidney mesenchyma, differentiated into neck, proximal, distal and collecting segments at 7 DPH when NKA immunopositive cells were observed. Their distal and collecting tubules showed an increasing immunofluorescence throughout their cytoplasm while the glomeruli remained unstained. From D 9 to D 17, the epithelial layer of pronephric collecting duct changed along the mesonephros to form ureters. Ureters, possessing isolated strong NKA immunopositive cells, appeared as two sac-like structures hanging under the trunk kidney. Since NKA immunopositive cells were not observed on the tegument or along the digestive tract of newly hatched prelarva, and also the gills are not formed yet, the pronephros is the only osmoregulatory organ until 4 DPH. At the larval stage, the pronephros and mesonephros are functional osmoregulatory organs and actively reabsorb necessary ions from the filtrate.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory experience regulates the development of various brain structures, including the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb (OB). Little is known about how sensory experience regulates the dendritic spine development of OB interneurons, such as granule cells (GCs), although it is well studied in mitral/tufted cells. Here, we identify a transcription factor, Npas4, which is expressed in OB GCs immediately after sensory input and is required for dendritic spine formation. Npas4 overexpression in OB GCs increases dendritic spine density, even under sensory deprivation, and rescues reduction of dendrite spine density in the Npas4 knockout OB. Furthermore, loss of Npas4 upregulates expression of the E3-ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which ubiquitinates a microtubule-associated protein Dcx. This leads to reduction in the dendritic spine density of OB GCs. Together, these findings suggest that Npas4 regulates Mdm2 expression to ubiquitinate and degrade Dcx during dendritic spine development in newborn OB GCs after sensory experience.

Abstract: Summary
Many mutant p53 proteins (mutp53s) exert oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) properties, but the mechanisms mediating these functions remain poorly defined. We show here that GOF mutp53s inhibit AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in head and neck cancer cells. Conversely, downregulation of GOF mutp53s enhances AMPK activation under energy stress, decreasing the activity of the anabolic factors acetyl-CoA carboxylase and ribosomal protein S6 and inhibiting aerobic glycolytic potential and invasive cell growth. Under conditions of energy stress, GOF mutp53s, but not wild-type p53, preferentially bind to the AMPKα subunit and inhibit AMPK activation. Given the importance of AMPK as an energy sensor and tumor suppressor that inhibits anabolic metabolism, our findings reveal that direct inhibition of AMPK activation is an important mechanism through which mutp53s can gain oncogenic function.

Abstract: Summary
Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) occupies a central place in cellular energy production, linking the tricarboxylic cycle with the electron transport chain. As a result, a subset of cancers and neuromuscular disorders result from mutations affecting any of the four SDH structural subunits or either of two known SDH assembly factors. Herein we characterize an evolutionarily conserved SDH assembly factor designated Sdh8/SDHAF4, using yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells. Sdh8 interacts specifically with the catalytic Sdh1 subunit in the mitochondrial matrix, facilitating its association with Sdh2 and the subsequent assembly of the SDH holocomplex. These roles for Sdh8 are critical for preventing motility defects and neurodegeneration in Drosophila as well as the excess ROS generated by free Sdh1. These studies provide insights into the mechanisms by which SDH is assembled and raise the possibility that some forms of neuromuscular disease may be associated with mutations that affect this SDH assembly factor.

Abstract: Summary
The chemokine receptor CCR7 plays a crucial role in the homing of central memory and naive T cells to peripheral lymphoid organs. Here, we show that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu downregulates CCR7 on the surface of CD4+ T cells. Vpu and CCR7 were found to specifically interact and colocalize within the trans-Golgi network, where CCR7 is retained. Downmodulation of CCR7 did not involve degradation or endocytosis and was strictly dependent on Vpu expression. Stimulation of HIV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells with the CCR7 ligand CCL19 resulted in reduced mobilization of Ca2+, reduced phosphorylation of Erk1/2, and impaired migration toward CCL19. Specific amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain of Vpu that were previously shown to be critical for BST-2 downmodulation (A14, A18, and W22) were also necessary for CCR7 downregulation. These results suggest that BST-2 and CCR7 may be downregulated via similar mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphorylation is often used to promote protein ubiquitylation, yet we rarely understand quantitatively how ligase activation and ubiquitin (UB) chain assembly are integrated with phosphoregulation. Here we employ quantitative proteomics and live-cell imaging to dissect individual steps in the PINK1 kinase-PARKIN UB ligase mitochondrial control pathway disrupted in Parkinson’s disease. PINK1 plays a dual role by phosphorylating PARKIN on its UB-like domain and poly-UB chains on mitochondria. PARKIN activation by PINK1 produces canonical and noncanonical UB chains on mitochondria, and PARKIN-dependent chain assembly is required for accumulation of poly-phospho-UB (poly-p-UB) on mitochondria. In vitro, PINK1 directly activates PARKIN’s ability to assemble canonical and noncanonical UB chains and promotes association of PARKIN with both p-UB and poly-p-UB. Our data reveal a feedforward mechanism that explains how PINK1 phosphorylation of both PARKIN and poly-UB chains synthesized by PARKIN drives a program of PARKIN recruitment and mitochondrial ubiquitylation in response to mitochondrial damage.

Abstract: There is well-established variability in the numbers of lipid bodies (LB) in macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Similarly to the steatosis observed in adipocytes and hepatocytes during hyperinsulinemia and nutrient overload, immune cell LB hyper-accumulate in response to bacterial and parasitic infection and inflammatory presentations. Recently we described that hyperinsulinemia, both in vitro and in vivo, drives steatosis and phenotypic changes in primary and transformed mast cells and basophils. LB reach high numbers in these steatotic cytosols, and here we propose that they could dramatically impact the transcytoplasmic signaling pathways. We compared calcium release and influx responses at the population and single cell level in normal and steatotic model mast cells. At the population level, all aspects of FcɛRI-dependent calcium mobilization, as well as activation of calcium-dependent downstream signaling targets such as NFATC1 phosphorylation are suppressed. At the single cell level, we demonstrate that LB are both sources and sinks of calcium following FcɛRI cross-linking. Unbiased analysis of the impact of the presence of LB on the rate of trans-cytoplasmic calcium signals suggest that LB enrichment accelerates calcium propagation, which may reflect a Bernoulli effect. LB abundance thus impacts this fundamental signaling pathway and its downstream targets.

Abstract: Summary
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is a decrease in neuronal gene expression induced by HDAC2 increase; however, the mechanisms involved are not fully elucidated. Here, we described how the tyrosine kinase c-Abl increases HDAC2 levels, inducing transcriptional repression of synaptic genes. Our data demonstrate that (1) in neurons, c-Abl inhibition with Imatinib prevents the AβO-induced increase in HDAC2 levels; (2) c-Abl knockdown cells show a decrease in HDAC2 levels, while c-Abl overexpression increases them; (3) c-Abl inhibition reduces HDAC2-dependent repression activity and HDAC2 recruitment to the promoter of several synaptic genes, increasing their expression; (4) c-Abl induces tyrosine phosphorylation of HDAC2, a posttranslational modification, affecting both its stability and repression activity; and (5) treatment with Imatinib decreases HDAC2 levels in a transgenic mice model of AD. Our results support the participation of the c-Abl/HDAC2 signaling pathway in the epigenetic blockade of gene expression in AD pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of cholesterol export from late endosomes causes cellular cholesterol imbalance, including cholesterol depletion in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here, using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) mutant cell lines and human NPC1 mutant fibroblasts, we show that altered cholesterol levels at the TGN/endosome boundaries trigger Syntaxin 6 (Stx6) accumulation into VAMP3, transferrin, and Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (REs). This increases Stx6/VAMP3 interaction and interferes with the recycling of αVβ3 and α5β1 integrins and cell migration, possibly in a Stx6-dependent manner. In NPC1 mutant cells, restoration of cholesterol levels in the TGN, but not inhibition of VAMP3, restores the steady-state localization of Stx6 in the TGN. Furthermore, elevation of RE cholesterol is associated with increased amounts of Stx6 in RE. Hence, the fine-tuning of cholesterol levels at the TGN-RE boundaries together with a subset of cholesterol-sensitive SNARE proteins may play a regulatory role in cell migration and invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been implicated in human neurological diseases such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), neurodegeneration, and autism. However, little is known about when and how mTOR is involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases, due to a lack of animal models that directly increase mTOR activity. Here, we generated transgenic mice expressing a gain-of-function mutant of mTOR in the forebrain in a temporally controlled manner. Selective activation of mTORC1 in embryonic stages induced cortical atrophy caused by prominent apoptosis of neuronal progenitors, associated with upregulation of HIF-1α. In striking contrast, activation of the mTORC1 pathway in adulthood resulted in cortical hypertrophy with fatal epileptic seizures, recapitulating human TSC. Activated mTORC1 in the adult cortex also promoted rapid accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions and activation of microglial cells, indicative of progressive neurodegeneration. Our findings demonstrate that mTORC1 plays different roles in developmental and adult stages and contributes to human neurological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have reported that competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) can act as sponges for a microRNA (miRNA) through their binding sites and that changes in ceRNA abundances from individual genes can modulate the activity of miRNAs. Consideration of this hypothesis would benefit from knowing the quantitative relationship between a miRNA and its endogenous target sites. Here, we altered intracellular target site abundance through expression of an miR-122 target in hepatocytes and livers and analyzed the effects on miR-122 target genes. Target repression was released in a threshold-like manner at high target site abundance (≥1.5 × 105 added target sites per cell), and this threshold was insensitive to the effective levels of the miRNA. Furthermore, in response to extreme metabolic liver disease models, global target site abundance of hepatocytes did not change sufficiently to affect miRNA-mediated repression. Thus, modulation of miRNA target abundance is unlikely to cause significant effects on gene expression and metabolism through a ceRNA effect.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubules (MTs) are cytoskeletal polymers that undergo dynamic instability, the stochastic transition between growth and shrinkage phases. MT dynamics are required for diverse cellular processes and, while intrinsic to tubulin, are highly regulated. However, little is known about how MT dynamics facilitate or are regulated by tissue biogenesis and differentiation. We imaged MT dynamics in a smooth muscle-like lineage in intact developing Caenorhabditis elegans. All aspects of MT dynamics change significantly as stem-like precursors exit mitosis and, secondarily, as they differentiate. We found that suppression, but not enhancement, of dynamics perturbs differentiated muscle function in vivo. Distinct ensembles of MT-associated proteins are specifically required for tissue biogenesis versus tissue function. A CLASP family MT stabilizer and the depolymerizing kinesin MCAK are differentially required for MT dynamics in the precursor or differentiated cells, respectively. All of these multidimensional phenotypic comparisons were facilitated by a data display method called the diamond graph.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular homeostasis is regulated by signals through multiple molecular networks that include protein phosphorylation and metabolites. However, where and when the signal flows through a network and regulates homeostasis has not been explored. We have developed a reconstruction method for the signal flow based on time-course phosphoproteome and metabolome data, using multiple databases, and have applied it to acute action of insulin, an important hormone for metabolic homeostasis. An insulin signal flows through a network, through signaling pathways that involve 13 protein kinases, 26 phosphorylated metabolic enzymes, and 35 allosteric effectors, resulting in quantitative changes in 44 metabolites. Analysis of the network reveals that insulin induces phosphorylation and activation of liver-type phosphofructokinase 1, thereby controlling a key reaction in glycolysis. We thus provide a versatile method of reconstruction of signal flow through the network using phosphoproteome and metabolome data.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based cell therapies have great potential for regenerative medicine but are also potentially associated with tumorigenic risks. Current rodent models are not optimal predictors of efficiency and safety for clinical application. Therefore, we developed a clinically relevant nonhuman primate model to assess the tumorigenic potential and in vivo efficacy of both undifferentiated and differentiated iPSCs in autologous settings without immunosuppression. Undifferentiated autologous iPSCs indeed form mature teratomas in a dose-dependent manner. However, tumor formation is accompanied by an inflammatory reaction. On the other hand, iPSC-derived mesodermal stromal-like cells form new bone in vivo without any evidence of teratoma formation. We therefore show in a large animal model that closely resembles human physiology that undifferentiated autologous iPSCs form teratomas, and that iPSC-derived progenitor cells can give rise to a functional tissue in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The recent HIV-1 vaccine failures highlight the need to better understand virus-host interactions. One key question is why CD8+ T cell responses to two HIV-Gag regions are uniquely associated with delayed disease progression only in patients expressing a few rare HLA class I variants when these regions encode epitopes presented by ∼30 more common HLA variants. By combining epitope processing and computational analyses of the two HIV subtypes responsible for ∼60% of worldwide infections, we identified a hitherto unrecognized adaptation to the antigen-processing machinery through substitutions at subtype-specific motifs. Multiple HLA variants presenting epitopes situated next to a given subtype-specific motif drive selection at this subtype-specific position, and epitope abundances correlate inversely with the HLA frequency distribution in affected populations. This adaptation reflects the sum of intrapatient adaptations, is predictable, facilitates viral subtype diversification, and increases global HIV diversity. Because low epitope abundance is associated with infrequent and weak T cell responses, this most likely results in both population-level immune evasion and inadequate responses in most people vaccinated with natural HIV-1 sequence constructs. Our results suggest that artificial sequence modifications at subtype-specific positions in vitro could refocus and reverse the poor immunogenicity of HIV proteins.

Abstract: Summary
CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8 genes are mutated in a mutually exclusive manner in 3M and other growth retardation syndromes. The mechanism underlying the function of the three 3M genes in development is not known. We found that OBSL1 and CCDC8 form a complex with CUL7 and regulate the level and centrosomal localization of CUL7, respectively. CUL7 depletion results in altered microtubule dynamics, prometaphase arrest, tetraploidy, and mitotic cell death. These defects are recaptured in CUL7 mutated 3M cells and can be rescued by wild-type, but not by 3M patient-derived CUL7 mutants. Depletion of either OBSL1 or CCDC8 results in defects and sensitizes cells to microtubule damage similarly to loss of CUL7 function. Microtubule damage reduces the level of CCDC8 that is required for the centrosomal localization of CUL7. We propose that CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8 proteins form a 3M complex that functions in maintaining microtubule and genome integrity and normal development.

Abstract: In this study, the chloroplast (cp) genome sequences from three early diverged leptosporangiate ferns were completed and analyzed in order to understand the evolution of the genome of the fern lineages. The complete cp genome sequence of Osmunda cinnamomea (Osmundales) was 142,812 base pairs (bp). The cp genome structure was similar to that of eusporangiate ferns. The gene/intron losses that frequently occurred in the cp genome of leptosporangiate ferns were not found in the cp genome of O. cinnamomea. In addition, putative RNA editing sites in the cp genome were rare in O. cinnamomea, even though the sites were frequently predicted to be present in leptosporangiate ferns. The complete cp genome sequence of Diplopterygium glaucum (Gleicheniales) was 151,007 bp and has a 9.7 kb inversion between the trnL-CAA and trnV-GCA genes when compared to O. cinnamomea. Several repeated sequences were detected around the inversion break points. The complete cp genome sequence of Lygodium japonicum (Schizaeales) was 157,142 bp and a deletion of the rpoC1 intron was detected. This intron loss was shared by all of the studied species of the genus Lygodium. The GC contents and the effective numbers of co-dons (ENCs) in ferns varied significantly when compared to seed plants. The ENC values of the early diverged leptosporangiate ferns showed intermediate levels between eusporangiate and core leptosporangiate ferns. However, our phylogenetic tree based on all of the cp gene sequences clearly indicated that the cp genome similarity between O. cinnamomea (Osmundales) and eusporangiate ferns are symplesiomorphies, rather than synapomorphies. Therefore, our data is in agreement with the view that Osmundales is a distinct early diverged lineage in the leptosporangiate ferns.

Abstract: Summary
A transient burst of actin polymerization assists endocytic budding. How actin polymerization is controlled in this context is not understood. Here, we show that crosstalk between PI(4,5)P2 and the CK2 catalytic subunit Cka2 controls actin polymerization at endocytic sites. We find that phosphorylation of the myosin-I Myo5 by Cka2 downregulates Myo5-induced Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization, whereas PI(4,5)P2 cooperatively relieves Myo5 autoinhibition and inhibits the catalytic activity of Cka2. Cka2 and the PI(4,5)P2-5-phosphatases Sjl1 and Sjl2, the yeast synaptojanins, exhibit genetic interactions indicating functional redundancy. The ultrastructural analysis of plasma membrane invaginations in CK2 and synaptojanin mutants demonstrates that both cooperate to initiate constriction of the invagination neck, a process coupled to the remodeling of the endocytic actin network. Our data demonstrate a holoenzyme-independent function of CK2 in endocytic budding and establish a robust genetic, functional, and molecular link between PI(4,5)P2 and CK2, two masters of intracellular signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages can fuse to form osteoclasts in bone or multinucleate giant cells (MGCs) as part of the immune response. We use a systems genetics approach in rat macrophages to unravel their genetic determinants of multinucleation and investigate their role in both bone homeostasis and inflammatory disease. We identify a trans-regulated gene network associated with macrophage multinucleation and Kcnn4 as being the most significantly trans-regulated gene in the network and induced at the onset of fusion. Kcnn4 is required for osteoclast and MGC formation in rodents and humans. Genetic deletion of Kcnn4 reduces macrophage multinucleation through modulation of Ca2+ signaling, increases bone mass, and improves clinical outcome in arthritis. Pharmacological blockade of Kcnn4 reduces experimental glomerulonephritis. Our data implicate Kcnn4 in macrophage multinucleation, identifying it as a potential therapeutic target for inhibition of bone resorption and chronic inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-cycle phase is a critical determinant of the choice between DNA damage repair by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). Here, we report that double-strand breaks (DSBs) induce ATM-dependent MOF (a histone H4 acetyl-transferase) phosphorylation (p-T392-MOF) and that phosphorylated MOF colocalizes with γ-H2AX, ATM, and 53BP1 foci. Mutation of the phosphorylation site (MOF-T392A) impedes DNA repair in S and G2 phase but not G1 phase cells. Expression of MOF-T392A also blocks the reduction in DSB-associated 53BP1 seen in wild-type S/G2 phase cells, resulting in enhanced 53BP1 and reduced BRCA1 association. Decreased BRCA1 levels at DSB sites correlates with defective repairosome formation, reduced HR repair, and decreased cell survival following irradiation. These data support a model whereby ATM-mediated MOF-T392 phosphorylation modulates 53BP1 function to facilitate the subsequent recruitment of HR repair proteins, uncovering a regulatory role for MOF in DSB repair pathway choice during S/G2 phase.

Abstract: Summary
Constitutive NF-κB signaling promotes survival in multiple myeloma (MM) and other cancers; however, current NF-κB-targeting strategies lack cancer cell specificity. Here, we identify the interaction between the NF-κB-regulated antiapoptotic factor GADD45β and the JNK kinase MKK7 as a therapeutic target in MM. Using a drug-discovery strategy, we developed DTP3, a D-tripeptide, which disrupts the GADD45β/MKK7 complex, kills MM cells effectively, and, importantly, lacks toxicity to normal cells. DTP3 has similar anticancer potency to the clinical standard, bortezomib, but more than 100-fold higher cancer cell specificity in vitro. Notably, DTP3 ablates myeloma xenografts in mice with no apparent side effects at the effective doses. Hence, cancer-selective targeting of the NF-κB pathway is possible and, at least for myeloma patients, promises a profound benefit.

Abstract: Summary
Breast carcinoma (BC) has been extensively profiled by high-throughput technologies for over a decade, and broadly speaking, these studies can be grouped into those that seek to identify patient subtypes (studies of heterogeneity) or those that seek to identify gene signatures with prognostic or predictive capacity. The sheer number of reported signatures has led to speculation that everything is prognostic in BC. Here, we show that this ubiquity is an apparition caused by a poor understanding of the interrelatedness between subtype and the molecular determinants of prognosis. Our approach constructively shows how to avoid confounding due to a patient’s subtype, clinicopathological profile, or treatment profile. The approach identifies patients who are predicted to have good outcome at time of diagnosis by all available clinical and molecular markers but who experience a distant metastasis within 5 years. These inherently difficult patients (∼7% of BC) are prioritized for investigations of intratumoral heterogeneity.

SETD2-Dependent Histone H3K36 Trimethylation Is Required for Homologous Recombination Repair and Genome Stability,

Abstract: Summary
Modulating chromatin through histone methylation orchestrates numerous cellular processes. SETD2-dependent trimethylation of histone H3K36 is associated with active transcription. Here, we define a role for H3K36 trimethylation in homologous recombination (HR) repair in human cells. We find that depleting SETD2 generates a mutation signature resembling RAD51 depletion at I-SceI-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites, with significantly increased deletions arising through microhomology-mediated end-joining. We establish a presynaptic role for SETD2 methyltransferase in HR, where it facilitates the recruitment of C-terminal binding protein interacting protein (CtIP) and promotes DSB resection, allowing Replication Protein A (RPA) and RAD51 binding to DNA damage sites. Furthermore, reducing H3K36me3 levels by overexpressing KDM4A/JMJD2A, an oncogene and H3K36me3/2 demethylase, or an H3.3K36M transgene also reduces HR repair events. We propose that error-free HR repair within H3K36me3-decorated transcriptionally active genomic regions promotes cell homeostasis. Moreover, these findings provide insights as to why oncogenic mutations cluster within the H3K36me3 axis.

Abstract: Summary
The role of endocytic proteins and the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial cell cohesion and tumor dissemination are not well understood. Here, we report that the endocytic F-BAR-containing CDC42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) is required for ERBB2- and TGF-β1-induced cell scattering, breast cancer (BC) cell motility and invasion into 3D matrices, and conversion from ductal breast carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma in mouse xenograft models. CIP4 promotes the formation of an E-cadherin-CIP4-SRC complex that controls SRC activation, E-cadherin endocytosis, and localized phosphorylation of the myosin light chain kinase, thereby impinging on the actomyosin contractility required to generate tangential forces to break cell-cell junctions. CIP4 is upregulated in ERBB2-positive human BC, correlates with increased distant metastasis, and is an independent predictor of poor disease outcome in subsets of BC patients. Thus, it critically controls cell-cell cohesion and is required for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype in breast tumors.

Abstract: Summary
TRIM58 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase superfamily member implicated by genome-wide association studies to regulate human erythrocyte traits. Here, we show that Trim58 expression is induced during late erythropoiesis and that its depletion by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) inhibits the maturation of late-stage nucleated erythroblasts to anucleate reticulocytes. Imaging flow cytometry studies demonstrate that Trim58 regulates polarization and/or extrusion of erythroblast nuclei. In vitro, Trim58 directly binds and ubiquitinates the intermediate chain of the microtubule motor dynein. In cells, Trim58 stimulates proteasome-dependent degradation of the dynein holoprotein complex. During erythropoiesis, Trim58 expression, dynein loss, and enucleation occur concomitantly, and all are inhibited by Trim58 shRNAs. Dynein regulates nuclear positioning and microtubule organization, both of which undergo dramatic changes during erythroblast enucleation. Thus, we propose that Trim58 promotes this process by eliminating dynein. Our findings identify an erythroid-specific regulator of enucleation and elucidate a previously unrecognized mechanism for controlling dynein activity.

Abstract: Summary
White adipose tissue (WAT) morphology characterized by hypertrophy (i.e., fewer but larger adipocytes) associates with increased adipose inflammation, lipolysis, insulin resistance, and risk of diabetes. However, the causal relationships and the mechanisms controlling WAT morphology are unclear. Herein, we identified EBF1 as an adipocyte-expressed transcription factor with decreased expression/activity in WAT hypertrophy. In human adipocytes, the regulatory targets of EBF1 were enriched for genes controlling lipolysis and adipocyte morphology/differentiation, and in both humans and murine models, reduced EBF1 levels associated with increased lipolysis and adipose hypertrophy. Although EBF1 did not affect adipose inflammation, TNFα reduced EBF1 gene expression. High-fat diet intervention in Ebf1+/− mice resulted in more pronounced WAT hypertrophy and attenuated insulin sensitivity compared with wild-type littermate controls. We conclude that EBF1 is an important regulator of adipose morphology and fat cell lipolysis and may constitute a link between WAT inflammation, altered lipid metabolism, adipose hypertrophy, and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Protein modification with ubiquitin chains is an essential signaling event catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Most human E3s contain a signature RING domain that recruits a ubiquitin-charged E2 and a separate domain for substrate recognition. How RING-E3s can build polymeric ubiquitin chains while binding substrates and E2s at defined interfaces remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the RING-E3 APC/C catalyzes chain elongation by strongly increasing the affinity of its E2 for the distal acceptor ubiquitin in a growing conjugate. This function of the APC/C requires its coactivator as well as conserved residues of the E2 and ubiquitin. APC/C’s ability to track the tip of an emerging conjugate is required for APC/C-substrate degradation and accurate cell division. Our results suggest that RING-E3s tether the distal ubiquitin of a growing chain in proximity to the active site of their E2s, allowing them to assemble polymeric conjugates without altering their binding to substrate or E2.

Abstract: Summary
The casein kinase 1A1 gene (CSNK1A1) is a putative tumor suppressor gene located in the common deleted region for del(5q) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We generated a murine model with conditional inactivation of Csnk1a1 and found that Csnk1a1 haploinsufficiency induces hematopoietic stem cell expansion and a competitive repopulation advantage, whereas homozygous deletion induces hematopoietic stem cell failure. Based on this finding, we found that heterozygous inactivation of Csnk1a1 sensitizes cells to a CSNK1 inhibitor relative to cells with two intact alleles. In addition, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in CSNK1A1 on the nondeleted allele of patients with del(5q) MDS. These studies demonstrate that CSNK1A1 plays a central role in the biology of del(5q) MDS and is a promising therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a deadly disease for which current treatments are inadequate. We demonstrate that biallelic inactivation of Lkb1 and Pten in the mouse lung leads to SCC that recapitulates the histology, gene expression, and microenvironment found in human disease. Lkb1;Pten null (LP) tumors expressed the squamous markers KRT5, p63 and SOX2, and transcriptionally resembled the basal subtype of human SCC. In contrast to mouse adenocarcinomas, the LP tumors contained immune populations enriched for tumor-associated neutrophils. SCA1+NGFR+ fractions were enriched for tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) that could serially transplant the disease in orthotopic assays. TPCs in the LP model and NGFR+ cells in human SCCs highly expressed Pd-ligand-1 (PD-L1), suggesting a mechanism of immune escape for TPCs.

Abstract: Summary
A substantial amount of mitochondrial energy is required for cell-cycle progression. The mechanisms underlying the coordination of the mitochondrial respiration with cell-cycle progression, especially the G2/M transition, remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that a fraction of cyclin B1/Cdk1 proteins localizes to the matrix of mitochondria and phosphorylates a cluster of mitochondrial proteins, including the complex I (CI) subunits in the respiratory chain. Cyclin B1/Cdk1-mediated CI phosphorylation enhances CI activity, whereas deficiency of such phosphorylation in each of the relevant CI subunits results in impairment of CI function. Mitochondria-targeted cyclin B1/Cdk1 increases mitochondrial respiration with enhanced oxygen consumption and ATP generation, which provides cells with efficient bioenergy for G2/M transition and shortens overall cell-cycle time. Thus, cyclin B1/Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of mitochondrial substrates allows cells to sense and respond to increased energy demand for G2/M transition and, subsequently, to upregulate mitochondrial respiration for successful cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial activity is controlled by proteins encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Here, we identify Sirt7 as a crucial regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis. Sirt7 deficiency in mice induces multisystemic mitochondrial dysfunction, which is reflected by increased blood lactate levels, reduced exercise performance, cardiac dysfunction, hepatic microvesicular steatosis, and age-related hearing loss. This link between SIRT7 and mitochondrial function is translatable in humans, where SIRT7 overexpression rescues the mitochondrial functional defect in fibroblasts with a mutation in NDUFSI. These wide-ranging effects of SIRT7 on mitochondrial homeostasis are the consequence of the deacetylation of distinct lysine residues located in the hetero- and homodimerization domains of GABPβ1, a master regulator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. SIRT7-mediated deacetylation of GABPβ1 facilitates complex formation with GABPα and the transcriptional activation of the GABPα/GABPβ heterotetramer. Altogether, these data suggest that SIRT7 is a dynamic nuclear regulator of mitochondrial function through its impact on GABPβ1 function.

Abstract: Many fossil lungfish have a system of mineralised tubules in the dermis of the snout, branching extensively and radiating towards the epidermis. The tubules anastomose in the superficial layer of the dermis, forming a plexus consisting of two layers of vessels, with branches that expand into pore canals and flask organs, flanked by cosmine nodules where these are present. Traces of this system are found in the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri, consisting of branching tubules in the dermis, a double plexus below the epidermis and dermal papillae entering the epidermis without reaching the surface. In N. forsteri, the tubules, the plexus and the dermal papillae consist of thick, unmineralised connective tissue, enclosing fine blood vessels packed with lymphocytes. Tissues in the epidermis and the dermis of N. forsteri are not associated with deposits of calcium, which is below detectable limits in the skin of the snout at all stages of the life cycle. Canals of the sensory line system, with mechanoreceptors, are separate from the tubules, the plexus and the dermal papillae, as are the electroreceptors in the epidermis. The system of tubules, plexus, dermal papillae and lymphatic capillaries may function to protect the tissues of the snout from infection.

Abstract: Summary
Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a soluble ligand overexpressed by neoplastic cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), drives formation of a fibroblast-rich desmoplastic stroma. To better understand its role in malignant progression, we deleted Shh in a well-defined mouse model of PDAC. As predicted, Shh-deficient tumors had reduced stromal content. Surprisingly, such tumors were more aggressive and exhibited undifferentiated histology, increased vascularity, and heightened proliferation—features that were fully recapitulated in control mice treated with a Smoothened inhibitor. Furthermore, administration of VEGFR blocking antibody selectively improved survival of Shh-deficient tumors, indicating that Hedgehog-driven stroma suppresses tumor growth in part by restraining tumor angiogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that some components of the tumor stroma can act to restrain tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is an antiatherogenic process in which excessive cholesterol from peripheral tissues is transported to the liver and finally excreted from the body via the bile. The nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) drives expression of genes regulating RCT, and its activity can be modified by different posttranslational modifications. Here, we show that atherosclerosis-prone mice carrying a mutation that abolishes SUMOylation of LRH-1 on K289R develop less aortic plaques than control littermates when exposed to a high-cholesterol diet. The mechanism underlying this atheroprotection involves an increase in RCT and its associated hepatic genes and is secondary to a compromised interaction of LRH-1 K289R with the corepressor prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1). Our study reveals that the SUMOylation status of a single nuclear receptor lysine residue can impact the development of a complex metabolic disease such as atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow (BM) metastasis remains one of the main causes of death associated with solid tumors as well as multiple myeloma (MM). Targeting the BM niche to prevent or modulate metastasis has not been successful to date. Here, we show that stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) is highly expressed in active MM, as well as in BM sites of tumor metastasis and report on the discovery of the high-affinity anti-SDF-1 PEGylated mirror-image l-oligonucleotide (olaptesed-pegol). In vivo confocal imaging showed that SDF-1 levels are increased within MM cell-colonized BM areas. Using in vivo murine and xenograft mouse models, we document that in vivo SDF-1 neutralization within BM niches leads to a microenvironment that is less receptive for MM cells and reduces MM cell homing and growth, thereby inhibiting MM disease progression. Targeting of SDF-1 represents a valid strategy for preventing or disrupting colonization of the BM by MM cells.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis, insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), disorders that increase risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To determine whether and how ER stress contributes to obesity-driven hepatic tumorigenesis we fed wild-type (WT) and MUP-uPA mice, in which hepatocyte ER stress is induced by plasminogen activator expression, with high-fat diet. Although both strains were equally insulin resistant, the MUP-uPA mice exhibited more liver damage, more immune infiltration, and increased lipogenesis and, as a result, displayed classical NASH signs and developed typical steatohepatitic HCC. Both NASH and HCC development were dependent on TNF produced by inflammatory macrophages that accumulate in the MUP-uPA liver in response to hepatocyte ER stress.

Abstract: Siah2 is a zebrafish homologue of mammalian Siah family. Siah acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds proteins destined for degradation. Extensive homology between siah and Drosophila Siah homologue (sina) suggests their important physiological roles during embryonic development. However, detailed functional studies of Siah in vertebrate development have not been carried out. Here we report that Siah2 specifically augments nodal related gene expression in marginal blastomeres at late blastula through early gastrula stages of zebrafish embryos. Siah2 dependent Nodal signaling augmentation is confirmed by cell-based reporter gene assays using 293T cells and 3TP-luciferase reporter plasmid. We also established a molecular hierarchy of Siah as a upstream regulator of FoxH1/Fast1 transcriptional factor in Nodal signaling. Elevated expression of nodal related genes by overexpression of Siah2 was enough to override the inhibitory effects of atv and lft2 on the Nodal signaling. In particular, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Siah2 is critical to limit the duration and/or magnitude of Nodal signaling. Additionally, since the embryos injected with Siah morpholinos mimicked the atv overexpression phenotype at least in part, our data support a model in which Siah is involved in mesendoderm patterning via modulating Nodal signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The thymus is a lymphoid organ unique to vertebrates, and it provides a unique microenvironment that facilitates the differentiation of immature hematopoietic precursors into mature T cells. We subjected the evolutionary trajectory of the thymic microenvironment to experimental analysis. A hypothetical primordial form of the thymus was established in mice by replacing FOXN1, the vertebrate-specific master regulator of thymic epithelial cell function, with its metazoan ancestor, FOXN4, thereby resetting the regulatory and coding changes that have occurred since the divergence of these two paralogs. FOXN4 exhibited substantial thymopoietic activity. Unexpectedly, histological changes and a functional imbalance between the lymphopoietic cytokine IL7 and the T cell specification factor DLL4 within the reconstructed thymus resulted in coincident but spatially segregated T and B cell development. Our results identify an evolutionary mechanism underlying the conversion of a general lymphopoietic organ to a site of exclusive T cell generation.

Abstract: Summary
MEK inhibitors are clinically active in BRAFV600E melanomas but only marginally so in KRAS mutant tumors. Here, we found that MEK inhibitors suppress ERK signaling more potently in BRAFV600E, than in KRAS mutant tumors. To understand this, we performed an RNAi screen in a KRAS mutant model and found that CRAF knockdown enhanced MEK inhibition. MEK activated by CRAF was less susceptible to MEK inhibitors than when activated by BRAFV600E. MEK inhibitors induced RAF-MEK complexes in KRAS mutant models, and disrupting such complexes enhanced inhibition of CRAF-dependent ERK signaling. Newer MEK inhibitors target MEK catalytic activity and also impair its reactivation by CRAF, either by disrupting RAF-MEK complexes or by interacting with Ser 222 to prevent MEK phosphorylation by RAF.

Abstract: Summary
Directional migration requires robust front/back polarity. We find that fibroblasts treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and prepolarized by plating on a fibronectin line substrate exhibit persistent migration for hours. This does not occur in the absence of PDGF or on uniformly coated fibronectin substrates. Persistent migration arises from establishment of two functional modules at cell front and back. At the front, formation of a zone containing podosome-like structures (PLS) dynamically correlates with low RhoA and myosin activity and absence of a contractile lamella. At the back, myosin contractility specifically controls tail retraction with minimal crosstalk to the front module. The PLS zone is maintained in a dynamic steady state that preserves size and position relative to the cell front, allowing for long-term coordination of front and back modules. We propose that front/back uncoupling achieved by the PLS zone is crucial for persistent migration in the absence of directional cues.

Abstract: Summary
Sterile inflammation triggered by endogenous factors is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we demonstrate that apoptosis-deficient mutants spontaneously develop a necrosis-driven systemic immune response in Drosophila and provide an in vivo model for studying the organismal response to sterile inflammation. Metabolomic analysis of hemolymph from apoptosis-deficient mutants revealed increased sarcosine and reduced S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) levels due to glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt) upregulation. We showed that Gnmt was elevated in response to Toll activation induced by the local necrosis of wing epidermal cells. Necrosis-driven inflammatory conditions induced dFoxO hyperactivation, leading to an energy-wasting phenotype. Gnmt was cell-autonomously upregulated by dFoxO in the fat body as a possible rheostat for controlling energy loss, which functioned during fasting as well as inflammatory conditions. We propose that the dFoxO-Gnmt axis is essential for the maintenance of organismal SAM metabolism and energy homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Rab GTPases, by targeting to specific membrane compartments, play essential roles in membrane trafficking. Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic subcellular organelles whose growth is closely linked to obesity and hepatic steatosis. Fsp27 is shown to be required for LD fusion and growth by enriching at LD-LD contact sites. Here, we identify Rab8a as a direct interactor and regulator of Fsp27 in mediating LD fusion in adipocytes. Knockdown of Rab8a in the livers of ob/ob mice results in the accumulation of smaller LDs and lower hepatic lipid levels. Surprisingly, it is the GDP-bound form of Rab8a that exhibits fusion-promoting activity. We further discover AS160 as the GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Rab8a, which forms a ternary complex with Fsp27 and Rab8a to positively regulate LD fusion. MSS4 antagonizes Fsp27-mediated LD fusion activity through Rab8a. Our results have thus revealed a mechanistic signaling circuit controlling LD fusion and fatty liver formation.

Abstract: The developmental oogenesis of gorgonian coral was investigated at the histological level. The objective of this study was to examine and improve the understanding of Junceella juncea oogenesis using ultrastructural methods, such as histological sectioning and transmission electron microscopy. At least three types of yolk materials were observed in this study: yolk body, lipid granules and cortical alveoli. Some of the complex yolk materials were encompassed by concentric or arched layers of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex in early stage oocytes. Different types of vesicles were found in both early and late stage oocytes and some granules could be seen inside the empty vesicles. This may be a possible method for elaborating complex yolk materials. Homogeneous yolks from different types of inclusions were abundant and the autosynthesis of yolk may be a major mechanism in J. juncea oocytes. This is the first report of the ultrastructural observation of oogenesis in gorgonian coral species using transmission electron microscopy. Our study obtained relatively detailed information at the ultrastructural level, and it provides an overview of the oocyte ultrastucture of the gorgonian coral J. juncea.

Abstract: Summary
In organellogenesis of the chloroplast from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria, the establishment of protein-targeting mechanisms to the chloroplast should have been pivotal. However, it is still mysterious how these mechanisms were established and how they work in plant cells. Here we show that AKR2A, the cytosolic targeting factor for chloroplast outer membrane (COM) proteins, evolved from the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of the host cell by stepwise extensions of its N-terminal domain and that two lipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), of the endosymbiont were selected to function as the AKR2A receptor. Structural analysis, molecular modeling, and mutational analysis of the ARD identified two adjacent sites for coincidental and synergistic binding of MGDG and PG. Based on these findings, we propose that the targeting mechanism of COM proteins was established using components from both the endosymbiont and host cell through a modification of the protein-protein-interacting ARD into a lipid binding domain.

Abstract: Summary
The lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) enzyme catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, is upregulated in human cancers, and is associated with aggressive tumor outcomes. Here we use an inducible murine model and demonstrate that inactivation of LDH-A in mouse models of NSCLC driven by oncogenic K-RAS or EGFR leads to decreased tumorigenesis and disease regression in established tumors. We also show that abrogation of LDH-A results in reprogramming of pyruvate metabolism, with decreased lactic fermentation in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. This was accompanied by reactivation of mitochondrial function in vitro, but not in vivo or ex vivo. Finally, using a specific small molecule LDH-A inhibitor, we demonstrated that LDH-A is essential for cancer-initiating cell survival and proliferation. Thus, LDH-A can be a viable therapeutic target for NSCLC, including cancer stem cell-dependent drug-resistant tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Misfolded proteins compromise cellular function and cause disease. How these proteins are detected and degraded is not well understood. Here we show that PML/TRIM19 and the SUMO-dependent ubiquitin ligase RNF4 act together to promote the degradation of misfolded proteins in the mammalian cell nucleus. PML selectively interacts with misfolded proteins through distinct substrate recognition sites and conjugates these proteins with the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) through its SUMO ligase activity. SUMOylated misfolded proteins are then recognized and ubiquitinated by RNF4 and are subsequently targeted for proteasomal degradation. We further show that PML deficiency exacerbates polyglutamine (polyQ) disease in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1). These findings reveal a mammalian system that removes misfolded proteins through sequential SUMOylation and ubiquitination and define its role in protection against protein-misfolding diseases.

Abstract: Summary
It has been proposed that Ataxin-2, a member of the like-Sm (LSm) protein family, participates in the regulation of RNA metabolism through interaction with PABPC1. However, the exact biological mechanism and in vivo targets remain unknown. Here, we report that Ataxin-2 binds directly to RNAs in a PABPC1-independent manner. High-throughput sequencing of Ataxin-2-bound RNAs prepared by PAR-CLIP revealed that Ataxin-2 binds predominantly to uridine-rich elements, including well-characterized cis-regulatory AU-rich elements, in the 3′ UTRs of target mRNAs. Gene expression analysis after Ataxin-2 depletion or overexpression revealed that Ataxin-2 stabilizes target mRNAs and increases the abundance of the corresponding proteins. A tethering assay demonstrated that Ataxin-2 elicits this effect by direct interaction with mRNAs. We also found that disease-associated polyglutamine expansion downregulates the physiological activity of Ataxin-2. These findings suggest that Ataxin-2 is an RNA-binding protein that targets cis-regulatory elements in 3′ UTRs to stabilize a subset of mRNAs and increase protein expression.

Abstract: Ultrastructural study of gonadal muscles in sea star, Asterina pectinifera, showed that myoepithelial cells were located only in the epithelial lining of the genital coelomic sinus. No myoepithelial cells were found in the visceral peritoneal epithelium or within connective tissue layer of the outer sac. Morphology of the myoepithelial cells in gonads of A. pectinifera varies during the reproductive cycle. During the gametogenic phase of the reproductive cycle, the myoepithelial cells get an elongated, spindle-like shape having a length of 20–30μm. In prespawning gonads, many of the myoepithelial cells form cytoplasmic extensions of 3–5μm in length, filled with myofilaments and penetrating into the underlying connective tissue of the outer sac or haemal sinus. Besides, myoepithelial cells, simultaneously anchored in the inner and outer sacs, were also observed. These changes result in development of more elaborated musculature and increase in contractility of the gonadal wall in prespawning gonads as compared to that during other stages of the reproductive cycle.

Abstract: MiR-217 can function as an oncogene or a tumour suppressor gene depending on cell type. However, the function of miR-217 in lung cancer remains unclear to date. This study aims to evaluate the function of miR-217 in lung cancer and investigate its effect on the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin. The expression of miR-217 was detected in 100 patients by real-time PCR. The effects of miR-217 overexpression on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of SPC-A-1 and A549 cells were investigated. The target gene of miR-217 was predicted by Targetscan online software, screened by dual luciferase reporter gene assay and demonstrated by Western blot. Finally, the effects of miR-217 up-regulation on the sensitivity of A549 cells to cisplatin were determined. The expression of miR-217 was significantly lower in lung cancer tissues than in noncancerous tissues (p < 0.001). The overexpression of miR-217 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion as well as promoted the apoptosis of lung cancer cells by targeting KRAS. The up-regulation of miR-217 enhanced the sensitivity of SPC-A-1 and A549 cells to cisplatin. In conclusion, miR-217 suppresses tumour development in lung cancer by targeting KRAS and enhances cell sensitivity to cisplatin. Our results encourage researchers to use cisplatin in combination with miR-217 to treat lung cancer. This regime might lead to low-dose cisplatin application and cisplatin side-effect reduction.

Abstract: Summary
Mosquito-transmitted malaria parasites infect hepatocytes and asymptomatically replicate as liver stages. Using RNA sequencing, we show that a rodent malaria liver-stage infection stimulates a robust innate immune response including type I interferon (IFN) and IFNγ pathways. Liver-stage infection is suppressed by these infection-engendered innate responses. This suppression was abrogated in mice deficient in IFNγ, the type I IFN α/β receptor (IFNAR), and interferon regulatory factor 3. Natural killer and CD49b+CD3+ natural killer T (NKT) cells increased in the liver after a primary infection, and CD1d-restricted NKT cells, which secrete IFNγ, were critical in reducing liver-stage burden of a secondary infection. Lack of IFNAR signaling abrogated the increase in NKT cell numbers in the liver, showing a link between type I IFN signaling, cell recruitment, and subsequent parasite elimination.

Abstract: Summary
Newly generated neurons initiate polarizing signals that specify a single axon and multiple dendrites, a process critical for patterning neuronal circuits in vivo. Here, we report that the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR is a polarity regulator that localizes asymmetrically in differentiating neurons in response to neurotrophins and is required for specification of the future axon. In cultured hippocampal neurons, local exposure to neurotrophins causes early accumulation of p75NTR into one undifferentiated neurite to specify axon fate. Moreover, knockout or knockdown of p75NTR results in failure to initiate an axon in newborn neurons upon cell-cycle exit in vitro and in the developing cortex, as well as during adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo. Hence, p75NTR governs neuronal polarity, determining pattern and assembly of neuronal circuits in adult hippocampus and cortical development.

Abstract: Summary
Synapse elimination is crucial for precise neural circuit formation during postnatal development. We examined how relative differences in synaptic strengths among competing inputs and/or absolute synaptic strengths contribute to climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapse elimination in the cerebellum. We generated mice with PC-selective deletion of stargazin (TARP γ-2), the major AMPA receptor auxiliary subunit in PCs (γ-2 PC-KO mice). Whereas relative differences between “strong” and “weak” CF-mediated postsynaptic response are preserved, absolute strengths of CF inputs are scaled down globally in PCs of γ-2 PC-KO mice. Although the early phase of CF elimination is normal, dendritic translocation of the strongest CF and the late phase of CF elimination that requires Ca2+-dependent activation of Arc/Arg3.1 in PCs are both impaired in γ-2 PC-KO mice. We conclude that, although relative differences in CF synaptic inputs are initially essential, proper synaptic scaling is crucial for accomplishing CF synapse elimination.

Abstract: Summary
The migration of cortical projection neurons is a multistep process characterized by dynamic cell shape remodeling. The molecular basis of these changes remains elusive, and the present work describes how microRNAs (miRNAs) control neuronal polarization during radial migration. We show that miR-22 and miR-124 are expressed in the cortical wall where they target components of the CoREST/REST transcriptional repressor complex, thereby regulating doublecortin transcription in migrating neurons. This molecular pathway underlies radial migration by promoting dynamic multipolar-bipolar cell conversion at early phases of migration, and later stabilization of cell polarity to support locomotion on radial glia fibers. Thus, our work emphasizes key roles of some miRNAs that control radial migration during cerebral corticogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The role of TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell dissemination is well established, but the involvement of lncRNAs in TGF-β signaling is still unknown. In this study, we observed that the lncRNA-activated by TGF-β (lncRNA-ATB) was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases and associated with poor prognosis. lncRNA-ATB upregulated ZEB1 and ZEB2 by competitively binding the miR-200 family and then induced EMT and invasion. In addition, lncRNA-ATB promoted organ colonization of disseminated tumor cells by binding IL-11 mRNA, autocrine induction of IL-11, and triggering STAT3 signaling. Globally, lncRNA-ATB promotes the invasion-metastasis cascade. Thus, these findings suggest that lncRNA-ATB, a mediator of TGF-β signaling, could predispose HCC patients to metastases and may serve as a potential target for antimetastatic therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells reside within specialized microenvironments, or niches, that control many aspects of stem cell behavior. Somatic hub cells in the Drosophila testis regulate the behavior of cyst stem cells (CySCs) and germline stem cells (GSCs) and are a primary component of the testis stem cell niche. The shutoff (shof) mutation, characterized by premature loss of GSCs and CySCs, was mapped to a locus encoding the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor Escargot (Esg). Hub cells depleted of Esg acquire CySC characteristics and differentiate as cyst cells, resulting in complete loss of hub cells and eventually CySCs and GSCs, similar to the shof mutant phenotype. We identified Esg-interacting proteins and demonstrate an interaction between Esg and the corepressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), which was also required for maintenance of hub cell fate. Our results indicate that niche cells can acquire stem cell properties upon removal of a single transcription factor in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic β cell failure in type 2 diabetes is associated with functional abnormalities of insulin secretion and deficits of β cell mass. It’s unclear how one begets the other. We have shown that loss of β cell mass can be ascribed to impaired FoxO1 function in different models of diabetes. Here we show that ablation of the three FoxO genes (1, 3a, and 4) in mature β cells results in early-onset, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-like diabetes, with abnormalities of the MODY networks Hnf4α, Hnf1α, and Pdx1. FoxO-deficient β cells are metabolically inflexible, i.e., they preferentially utilize lipids rather than carbohydrates as an energy source. This results in impaired ATP generation and reduced Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion. The present findings demonstrate a secretory defect caused by impaired FoxO activity that antedates dedifferentiation. We propose that defects in both pancreatic β cell function and mass arise through FoxO-dependent mechanisms during diabetes progression.

Abstract: Enzymes synthesizing reactive oxygen (Nox family) have recently been identified. Elucidation of the production mechanism has been initiated, and the involvement of reactive oxygen in metabolism, intracellular transport, signal transmission and apoptosis has been reported. We immunohistochemically investigated expression and localization of the Nox family in endochondral ossification using a normal mouse femur. Weakly positive reactions with Nox1, Noxa1, and Noxo1 were observed in the zones of proliferative and prehypertrophic chondrocytes at 3 weeks of age. Nox4 was widely positive from the resting over the hypertrophic cell zone. At 18 weeks of age, none of the Nox types was expressed in chondrocytes as the zones disappeared. On the other hand, positive reactions with Nox1, Noxa1, Noxo1, and Nox4 were observed in osteoblasts in the zone of ossification at 3 weeks of age, and each Nox was also positive in osteoblasts arranged on the bone marrow side in the epiphyseal cartilage at 18 weeks of age. In addition, a reactive oxygen-eliminating enzyme, Mn-SOD, was observed only in prehypertrophic chondrocytes at 3 weeks of age, and not detected in osteoblasts. It was suggested that the Nox family is closely associated with endochondral ossification of the mouse femur, and Nox1 and Nox4 are closely involved in the chondrocyte maturation process and bone matrix formation.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control gene expression by regulating mRNA translation and stability. The CCR4-NOT complex is a key effector of miRNA function acting downstream of GW182/TNRC6 proteins. We show that miRNA-mediated repression requires the central region of CNOT1, the scaffold protein of CCR4-NOT. A CNOT1 domain interacts with CNOT9, which in turn interacts with the silencing domain of TNRC6 in a tryptophan motif-dependent manner. These interactions are direct, as shown by the structure of a CNOT9-CNOT1 complex with bound tryptophan. Another domain of CNOT1 with an MIF4G fold recruits the DEAD-box ATPase DDX6, a known translational inhibitor. Structural and biochemical approaches revealed that CNOT1 modulates the conformation of DDX6 and stimulates ATPase activity. Structure-based mutations showed that the CNOT1 MIF4G-DDX6 interaction is important for miRNA-mediated repression. These findings provide insights into the repressive steps downstream of the GW182/TNRC6 proteins and the role of the CCR4-NOT complex in posttranscriptional regulation in general.

Abstract: Summary
Gene transcription responds to stress and metabolic signals to optimize growth and survival. Histone H3 (H3) lysine 4 trimethylation (K4me3) facilitates state changes, but how levels are coordinated with the environment is unclear. Here, we show that isomerization of H3 at the alanine 15-proline 16 (A15-P16) peptide bond is influenced by lysine 14 (K14) and controls gene-specific K4me3 by balancing the actions of Jhd2, the K4me3 demethylase, and Spp1, a subunit of the Set1 K4 methyltransferase complex. Acetylation at K14 favors the A15-P16trans conformation and reduces K4me3. Environmental stress-induced genes are most sensitive to the changes at K14 influencing H3 tail conformation and K4me3. By contrast, ribosomal protein genes maintain K4me3, required for their repression during stress, independently of Spp1, K14, and P16. Thus, the plasticity in control of K4me3, via signaling to K14 and isomerization at P16, informs distinct gene regulatory mechanisms and processes involving K4me3.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA (miRNA) transfer via exosomes may mediate cell-to-cell communication. Interestingly, specific miRNAs are enriched in exosomes in a cell-type-dependent fashion. However, the mechanisms whereby miRNAs are sorted to exosomes and the significance of miRNA transfer to acceptor cells are unclear. We used macrophages and endothelial cells (ECs) as a model of heterotypic cell communication in order to investigate both processes. RNA profiling of macrophages and their exosomes shows that miRNA sorting to exosomes is modulated by cell-activation-dependent changes of miRNA target levels in the producer cells. Genetically perturbing the expression of individual miRNAs or their targeted transcripts promotes bidirectional miRNA relocation from the cell cytoplasm/P bodies (sites of miRNA activity) to multivesicular bodies (sites of exosome biogenesis) and controls miRNA sorting to exosomes. Furthermore, the use of Dicer-deficient cells and reporter lentiviral vectors (LVs) for miRNA activity shows that exosomal miRNAs are transferred from macrophages to ECs to detectably repress targeted sequences.

Abstract: Cell migration requires a defined cell polarity which is formed by diverse cytoskeletal components differentially localized to the poles of cells to extracellular signals. Rap-GAP3 transiently and rapidly translocates to the cell cortex in response to chemoattractant stimulation and localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells. Here, we examined localization of truncated RapGAP3 proteins and found that the I/LWEQ domain in the central region of RapGAP3 was sufficient for posterior localization in migrating cells, as opposed to leading-edge localization of full-length Rap-GAP3. All truncated proteins accumulated at the leading edge of migrating cells exhibited clear translocation to the cell cortex in response to stimulation, whereas proteins localized to the posterior in migrating cells displayed no translocation to the cortex. The I/LWEQ domain appears to passively accumulate at the posterior region in migrating cells due to exclusion from the extended front region in response to chemoattractant stimulation rather than actively being localized to the back of cells. Our results suggest that posterior localization of the I/LWEQ domain of RapGAP3 is likely related to F-actin, which has probably different properties compared to newly formed F-actin at the leading edge of migrating cells, at the lateral and posterior regions of the cell.

Abstract: Summary
We report the identification and characterization of a five-carbon protein posttranslational modification (PTM) called lysine glutarylation (Kglu). This protein modification was detected by immunoblot and mass spectrometry (MS), and then comprehensively validated by chemical and biochemical methods. We demonstrated that the previously annotated deacetylase, sirtuin 5 (SIRT5), is a lysine deglutarylase. Proteome-wide analysis identified 683 Kglu sites in 191 proteins and showed that Kglu is highly enriched on metabolic enzymes and mitochondrial proteins. We validated carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1), the rate-limiting enzyme in urea cycle, as a glutarylated protein and demonstrated that CPS1 is targeted by SIRT5 for deglutarylation. We further showed that glutarylation suppresses CPS1 enzymatic activity in cell lines, mice, and a model of glutaric acidemia type I disease, the last of which has elevated glutaric acid and glutaryl-CoA. This study expands the landscape of lysine acyl modifications and increases our understanding of the deacylase SIRT5.

Abstract: Summary
Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by cellular sensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinkers. The molecular defect in FA is an impaired DNA repair pathway. The critical event in activating this pathway is monoubiquitination of FANCD2. In vivo, a multisubunit FA core complex catalyzes this step, but its mechanism is unclear. Here, we report purification of a native avian FA core complex and biochemical reconstitution of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. This demonstrates that the catalytic FANCL E3 ligase subunit must be embedded within the complex for maximal activity and site specificity. We genetically and biochemically define a minimal subcomplex comprising just three proteins (FANCB, FANCL, and FAAP100) that functions as the monoubiquitination module. Residual FANCD2 monoubiquitination activity is retained in cells defective for other FA core complex subunits. This work describes the in vitro reconstitution and characterization of this multisubunit monoubiquitin E3 ligase, providing key insight into the conserved FA DNA repair pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Serotonin and dopamine are major neuromodulators. Here, we used a modified rabies virus to identify monosynaptic inputs to serotonin neurons in the dorsal and median raphe (DR and MR). We found that inputs to DR and MR serotonin neurons are spatially shifted in the forebrain, and MR serotonin neurons receive inputs from more medial structures. Then, we compared these data with inputs to dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We found that DR serotonin neurons receive inputs from a remarkably similar set of areas as VTA dopamine neurons apart from the striatum, which preferentially targets dopamine neurons. Our results suggest three major input streams: a medial stream regulates MR serotonin neurons, an intermediate stream regulates DR serotonin and VTA dopamine neurons, and a lateral stream regulates SNc dopamine neurons. These results provide fundamental organizational principles of afferent control for serotonin and dopamine.

Abstract: Summary
In marmoset T cells transformed by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), a viral U-rich noncoding (nc) RNA, HSUR 1, specifically mediates degradation of host microRNA-27 (miR-27). High-throughput sequencing of RNA after crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) identified mRNAs targeted by miR-27 as enriched in the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, including GRB2. Accordingly, transfection of miR-27 into human T cells attenuates TCR-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and induction of CD69. MiR-27 also robustly regulates SEMA7A and IFN-γ, key modulators and effectors of T cell function. Knockdown or ectopic expression of HSUR 1 alters levels of these proteins in virally transformed cells. Two other T-lymphotropic γ-herpesviruses, AlHV-1 and OvHV-2, do not produce a noncoding RNA to downregulate miR-27 but instead encode homologs of miR-27 target genes. Thus, oncogenic γ-herpesviruses have evolved diverse strategies to converge on common targets in host T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses interact extensively with host proteins, but the mechanisms controlling these interactions are not well understood. We present a comprehensive analysis of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) in 2,208 viral genomes and reveal that viruses exploit molecular mimicry of host-like ELMs to possibly assist in host-virus interactions. Using a statistical genomics approach, we identify a large number of potentially functional ELMs and observe that the occurrence of ELMs is often evolutionarily conserved but not uniform across virus families. Some viral proteins contain multiple types of ELMs, in striking similarity to complex regulatory modules in host proteins, suggesting that ELMs may act combinatorially to assist viral replication. Furthermore, a simple evolutionary model suggests that the inherent structural simplicity of ELMs often enables them to tolerate mutations and evolve quickly. Our findings suggest that ELMs may allow fast rewiring of host-virus interactions, which likely assists rapid viral evolution and adaptation to diverse environments.

Abstract: Summary
Leptin has beneficial effects on glucose metabolism via actions in the hypothalamus, but the roles of specific subgroups of neurons responsible for these antidiabetic effects remain unresolved. We generated diabetic Lepob/ob or Leprdb/db mice lacking or re-expressing leptin receptors (LepRb) in subgroups of neurons to explore their contributions to leptin’s glucose-lowering actions. We show that agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are both required and sufficient to correct hyperglycemia by leptin. LepRb in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons or steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) neurons are not required. Furthermore, normalization of blood glucose by leptin is blunted in Lepob/ob/MC4R-null mice, but not in Lepob/ob mice lacking neuropeptide Y (NPY) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in AgRP neurons. Leptin’s ability to improve glucose balance is accompanied by a reduction in circulating glucagon. We conclude that AgRP neurons play a crucial role in glucose-lowering actions by leptin and that this requires the melanocortin system, but not NPY and GABA.

Abstract: Summary
Despite correlations between histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity and gene regulation, direct evidence that HMT activity is responsible for gene activation is sparse. We address the role of the HMT activity for MLL1, a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase critical for maintaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we show that the SET domain, and thus HMT activity of MLL1, is dispensable for maintaining HSCs and supporting leukemogenesis driven by the MLL-AF9 fusion oncoprotein. Upon Mll1 deletion, histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation is selectively depleted at MLL1 target genes in conjunction with reduced transcription. Surprisingly, inhibition of SIRT1 is sufficient to prevent the loss of H4K16 acetylation and the reduction in MLL1 target gene expression. Thus, recruited MOF activity, and not the intrinsic HMT activity of MLL1, is central for the maintenance of HSC target genes. In addition, this work reveals a role for SIRT1 in opposing MLL1 function.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling crosstalk between tumor cells and fibroblasts confers proinvasive properties to the tumor microenvironment. Here, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a tumor promoter that mediates proinvasive activation of stromal fibroblasts independent of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression. We demonstrate that a pulse of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) establishes stable proinvasive fibroblast activation by inducing LIF production in both fibroblasts and tumor cells. In fibroblasts, LIF mediates TGF-β-dependent actomyosin contractility and extracellular matrix remodeling, which results in collective carcinoma cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, carcinomas from multiple origins and melanomas display strong LIF upregulation, which correlates with dense collagen fiber organization, cancer cell collective invasion, and poor clinical outcome. Blockade of JAK activity by Ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor) counteracts fibroblast-dependent carcinoma cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. These findings establish LIF as a proinvasive fibroblast producer independent of α-SMA and may open novel therapeutic perspectives for patients with aggressive primary tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), endothelial-specific secretory granules that are central to primary hemostasis and inflammation, occur in dimensions ranging between 0.5 and 5 μm. How their size is determined and whether it has a functional relevance are at present unknown. Here, we provide evidence for a dual role of the Golgi apparatus in controlling the size of these secretory carriers. At the ministack level, cisternae constrain the size of nanostructures (“quanta”) of von Willebrand factor (vWF), the main WPB cargo. The ribbon architecture of the Golgi then allows copackaging of a variable number of vWF quanta within the continuous lumen of the trans-Golgi network, thereby generating organelles of different sizes. Reducing the WPB size abates endothelial cell hemostatic function by drastically diminishing platelet recruitment, but, strikingly, the inflammatory response (the endothelial capacity to engage leukocytes) is unaltered. Size can thus confer functional plasticity to an organelle by differentially affecting its activities.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is the major pathway by which macromolecules and organelles are degraded. Autophagy is regulated by the mTOR signaling pathway—the focal point for integration of metabolic information, with mTORC1 playing a central role in balancing biosynthesis and catabolism. Of the various inputs to mTORC1, the amino acid sensing pathway is among the most potent. Based upon transcriptome analysis of neurons subjected to nutrient deprivation, we identified let-7 microRNA as capable of promoting neuronal autophagy. We found that let-7 activates autophagy by coordinately downregulating the amino acid sensing pathway to prevent mTORC1 activation. Let-7 induced autophagy in the brain to eliminate protein aggregates, establishing its physiological relevance for in vivo autophagy modulation. Moreover, peripheral delivery of let-7 anti-miR repressed autophagy in muscle and white fat, suggesting that let-7 autophagy regulation extends beyond CNS. Hence, let-7 plays a central role in nutrient homeostasis and proteostasis regulation in higher organisms.

Abstract: Summary
BS69 (also called ZMYND11) contains tandemly arranged PHD, BROMO, and PWWP domains, which are chromatin recognition modalities. Here, we show that BS69 selectively recognizes histone variant H3.3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3.3K36me3) via its chromatin-binding domains. We further identify BS69 association with RNA splicing regulators, including the U5 snRNP components of the spliceosome, such as EFTUD2. Remarkably, RNA sequencing shows that BS69 mainly regulates intron retention (IR), which is the least understood RNA alternative splicing event in mammalian cells. Biochemical and genetic experiments demonstrate that BS69 promotes IR by antagonizing EFTUD2 through physical interactions. We further show that regulation of IR by BS69 also depends on its binding to H3K36me3-decorated chromatin. Taken together, our study identifies an H3.3K36me3-specific reader and a regulator of IR and reveals that BS69 connects histone H3.3K36me3 to regulated RNA splicing, providing significant, important insights into chromatin regulation of pre-mRNA processing.

Abstract: ICa-gated Ca2+ release (CICR) from the cardiac SR is the main mechanism mediating the rise of cytosolic Ca2+, but the extent to which mitochondria contribute to the overall Ca2+ signaling remains controversial. To examine the possible role of mitochondria in Ca2+ signaling, we developed a low affinity mitochondrial Ca2+ probe, mitycam-E31Q (300–500 MOI, 48–72h) and used it in conjunction with Fura-2AM to obtain simultaneous TIRF images of mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Mitycam-E31Q staining of adult feline cardiomyocytes showed the typical mitochondrial longitudinal fluorescent bandings similar to that of TMRE staining, while neonatal rat cardiomyocytes had a disorganized tubular or punctuate appearance. Caffeine puffs produced rapid increases in cytosolic Ca2+ while simultaneously measured global mitycam-E31Q signals decreased more slowly (increased mitochondrial Ca2+) before decaying to baseline levels. Similar, but oscillating mitycam-E31Q signals were seen in spontaneously pacing cells. Withdrawal of Na+ increased global cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in one population of mitochondria, but unexpectedly decreased it (release of Ca2+) in another mitochondrial population. Such mitochondrial Ca2+ release signals were seen not only during long lasting Na+ withdrawal, but also when Ca2+ loaded cells were exposed to caffeine-puffs, and during spontaneous rhythmic beating. Thus, mitochondrial Ca2+ transients appear to activate with a delay following the cytosolic rise of Ca2+ and show diversity in subpopulations of mitochondria that could contribute to the plasticity of mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling.

Abstract: The contribution of the Ca2+ sensor S100A1 to in vivo Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathobiology has not been elucidated although S100A1 regulates numerous cellular processes linked to AD. This study uses genetic ablation to ascertain the effects of S100A1 on neuroinflammation, beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition and Akt activity in the PSAPP AD mouse model. PSAPP/S100A1−/− mice exhibited decreases in astrocytosis (GFAP burden), microgliosis (Iba1 burden) and plaque load/number when compared to PSAPP/S100A1+/+ mice at six and twelve months of age. The presence of detectable S100A1 staining in human AD specimens is consistent with a detrimental gain of S100A1 function in AD. S100A1 ablation also reduced plaque associated and increased non-plaque associated PO4-Akt and PO4-GSK3β staining. S100A1·Akt complexes were undetectable in PC12 cells and AD brain tissue suggesting that S100A1 indirectly modulates Akt activity. In contrast, S100A1·RyR (ryanodine receptor) complexes were present in human/mouse AD brain and exhibited Ca2+-dependent formation in neuronal cells. This is the first direct demonstration of an S100A1· target protein complex in tissue/cells and identifies the RyR as a primary S100A1 target protein in the brain. Collectively, these data suggest that S100A1 inhibition may be a novel strategy for normalizing aberrant Ca2+ signaling in AD.

Abstract: Summary
UHRF1 is a multidomain protein crucially linking histone H3 modification states and DNA methylation. While the interaction properties of its specific domains are well characterized, little is known about the regulation of these functionalities. We show that UHRF1 exists in distinct active states, binding either unmodified H3 or the H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) modification. A polybasic region (PBR) in the C terminus blocks interaction of a tandem tudor domain (TTD) with H3K9me3 by occupying an essential peptide-binding groove. In this state the plant homeodomain (PHD) mediates interaction with the extreme N terminus of the unmodified H3 tail. Binding of the phosphatidylinositol phosphate PI5P to the PBR of UHRF1 results in a conformational rearrangement of the domains, allowing the TTD to bind H3K9me3. Our results define an allosteric mechanism controlling heterochromatin association of an essential regulatory protein of epigenetic states and identify a functional role for enigmatic nuclear phosphatidylinositol phosphates.

Abstract: Summary
Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) can prevent infection in animal models. Characterized bNAb targets, although key to vaccine and therapeutic strategies, are currently limited. We defined a new site of vulnerability by solving structures of bNAb 8ANC195 complexed with monomeric gp120 by X-ray crystallography and trimeric Env by electron microscopy. The site includes portions of gp41 and N-linked glycans adjacent to the CD4-binding site on gp120, making 8ANC195 the first donor-derived anti-HIV-1 bNAb with an epitope spanning both Env subunits. Rather than penetrating the glycan shield by using a single variable-region CDR loop, 8ANC195 inserted its entire heavy-chain variable domain into a gap to form a large interface with gp120 glycans and regions of the gp120 inner domain not contacted by other bNAbs. By isolating additional 8ANC195 clonal variants, we identified a more potent variant, which may be valuable for therapeutic approaches using bNAb combinations with nonoverlapping epitopes.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a lysosome-dependent degradation process that has been implicated in age-associated diseases. Autophagy is involved in both cell survival and cell death, but little is known about the mechanisms that distinguish its use during these distinct cell fates. Here, we identify the microRNA miR-14 as being both necessary and sufficient for autophagy during developmentally regulated cell death in Drosophila. Loss of miR-14 prevented induction of autophagy during salivary gland cell death, but had no effect on starvation-induced autophagy in the fat body. Moreover, misexpression of miR-14 was sufficient to prematurely induce autophagy in salivary glands, but not in the fat body. Importantly, miR-14 regulates this context-specific autophagy through its target, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate kinase 2 (ip3k2), thereby affecting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) signaling and calcium levels during salivary gland cell death. This study provides in vivo evidence of microRNA regulation of autophagy through modulation of IP3 signaling.

Regulation of p53 by Mdm2 E3 Ligase Function Is Dispensable in Embryogenesis and Development, but Essential in Response to DNA Damage,

Abstract: Summary
Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated p53 degradation is generally accepted as the major mechanism for p53 regulation; nevertheless, the in vivo significance of this function has not been unequivocally established. Here, we have generated an Mdm2Y487A knockin mouse; Mdm2Y487A mutation inactivates Mdm2 E3 ligase function without affecting its ability to bind its homolog MdmX. Unexpectedly, Mdm2Y487A/Y487A mice were viable and developed normally into adulthood. While disruption of Mdm2 E3 ligase function resulted in p53 accumulation, p53 transcriptional activity remained low; however, exposure to sublethal stress resulted in hyperactive p53 and p53-dependent mortality in Mdm2Y487A/Y487A mice. These findings reveal a potentially dispensable nature for Mdm2 E3 ligase function in p53 regulation, providing insight that may affect how this pathway is targeted therapeutically.
