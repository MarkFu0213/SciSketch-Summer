Abstract: Adipose organ is made of white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissue which are primarily responsible for lipid storage and energy production (heat and ATP) respectively. Metabolic activation of WAT may ascribe to this tissue characteristics of BAT, namely non-shivering thermogenesis and ATP production. Recent data indicate that apolipoproteins E (APOE) and A1 (APOA1) regulate WAT mitochondrial metabolic activation. Here, we investigated the functional cross-talk between natural human APOE2 and APOE4 isoforms with APOA1 in this process, using Apoe2knock-in and Apoe4knock-in mice. At baseline when Apoe2knock-in and Apoe4knock-in mice express both APOE and Apoa1, the Apoe2knock-in strain appears to have higher mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation levels and non-shivering thermogenesis in WAT compared to Apoe4knock-in mice. When mice were switched to a high-fat diet for 18 weeks, circulating levels of endogenous Apoa1 in Apoe2knock-in mice became barely detectable though significant levels of APOE2 were still present. This change was accompanied by a significant reduction in WAT mitochondrial Ucp1 expression while BAT Ucp1 was unaffected. Ectopic APOA1 expression in Apoe2knock-in animals potently stimulated WAT but not BAT mitochondrial Ucp1 expression providing further evidence that APOA1 potently stimulates WAT non-shivering thermogenesis in the presence of APOE2. Ectopic expression of APOA1 in Apoe4knock-in mice stimulated BAT but no WAT mitochondrial Ucp1 levels, suggesting that in the presence of APOE4, APOA1 is a trigger of BAT non-shivering thermogenesis. Overall, our data identified a tissue-specific role of the natural human APOE2 and APOE4 isoforms in WAT- and BAT-metabolic activation respectively, that appears dependent on circulating APOA1 levels.

Abstract: After decades in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3's shadow, PtdIns(3,4)P2 has now emerged as a bona fide regulator of important cellular events, including endocytosis and cell migration. New understanding of PtdIns(3,4)P2's cellular roles has been possible via novel approaches to observe and quantify cellular PtdIns(3,4)P2 dynamics, alongside methods to target the kinases and phosphatases governing phosphoinositide turnover. Despite this, the mechanisms by which PtdIns(3,4)P2 orchestrates its cellular roles remain more poorly understood, most notably because, to date, few PtdIns(3,4)P2 effectors have been identified. Here, we develop and apply an affinity-proteomics strategy to conduct a global screen for PtdIns(3,4)P2 interactors in human platelets; a primary cell type with striking PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation. Through an integrated approach, coupling affinity capture of PtdIns(3,4)P2-binding proteins to both label-free and isobaric tag-based quantitative proteomics, we identify a diverse PtdIns(3,4)P2 interactome. Included are long-established PtdIns(3,4)P2-binding proteins such as PLEKHA1, PLEKHA2, AKT and DAPP1, and a host of potentially novel effectors, including MTMR5, PNKD, RASA3 and GAB3. The PtdIns(3,4)P2 interactome shows an enrichment of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins, and through bioinformatics and array analyses we characterise the PH domain of MTMR5 and define its phosphoinositide selectivity. The interactome is also diverse in function, including several proteins known to support protein trafficking and cytoskeletal mobilisation. Such proteins have the ability to drive key platelet events, and to fulfil recently-defined roles for PtdIns(3,4)P2 in a wider range of cell types. Moreover, this study will serve as a valuable resource for the future characterisation of effector-driven PtdIns(3,4)P2 function.

Abstract: Increasing evidence underline the role of inflammation in the behavioral, emotional and cognitive dysregulations displayed in anorexia nervosa (AN). Among the inflammatory mediators acting at both peripheral and central levels, growing attention receives a class of lipids derived from arachidonic acid (AA), called eicosanoids (eiCs), which exert a complex, multifaceted role in a wide range of neuroinflammatory processes, peripheral inflammation, and generally in immune system function. To date, little is known about their possible involvement in the neurobiological underpinnings of AN. The present study evaluated whether the activity-based model of AN (ABA) may alter AA-metabolic pathways by changing the levels of AA-derived eiCs in specific brain areas implicated in the development of the typical anorexic-like phenotype, i.e. in prefrontal cortex, cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum. Our results point to brain region-specific alterations of the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP) metabolic pathways rendering altered levels of AA-derived eiCs (i.e. prostaglandins, thromboxanes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) in response to induction of and recovery from the ABA condition. These changes, supported by altered messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of genes coding for enzymes involved in eiCs-related methabolic pathways (i.e., PLA2, COX-2, 5-LOX and 15-LOX), underlie a widespread brain dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory eiC-mediated processes in the ABA model of AN. These data suggest the importance of eiCs signaling within corticolimbic areas in regulating key neurobehavioral functions and highlight eiCs as biomarker candidates for monitoring the onset and development of AN, and/or as possible targets for pharmacological management.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. CF is manifested by abnormal accumulation of mucus in the lungs, which serves as fertile ground for the growth of microorganisms leading to recurrent infections and ultimately, lung failure. Mucus in CF patients consists of DNA from dead neutrophils as well as mucins produced by goblet cells. MUC5AC mucin leads to pathological plugging of the airways whereas MUC5B has a protective role against bacterial infection. Therefore, decreasing the level of MUC5AC while maintaining MUC5B intact would in principle be a desirable mucoregulatory treatment outcome. Fenretinide prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase of MUC5AC gene expression, without affecting the level of MUC5B, in a lung goblet cell line. Additionally, fenretinide treatment reversed the pro-inflammatory imbalance of fatty acids by increasing docosahexaenoic acid and decreasing the levels of arachidonic acid in a lung epithelial cell line and primary leukocytes derived from CF patients. Furthermore, for the first time we also demonstrate the effect of fenretinide on multiple unsaturated fatty acids, as well as differential effects on the levels of long- compared to very-long-chain saturated fatty acids which are important substrates of complex phospholipids. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-treating mice with fenretinide in a chronic model of P. aeruginosa lung infection efficiently decreases the accumulation of mucus. These findings suggest that fenretinide may offer a new approach to therapeutic modulation of pathological mucus production in CF.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein F (ApoF) regulates cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity. We previously observed that hepatic APOF mRNA levels are decreased by high fat, cholesterol-enriched diets. Here we show in human liver C3A cells that APOF mRNA levels are reduced by agonists of LXR and PPARα nuclear receptors. This negative regulation requires co-incubation with the RXR agonist, retinoic acid. Bioinformatic analysis of the ~2 kb sequence upstream of the APOF promoter identified one potential LXR and 4 potential PPARα binding sites clustered between nucleotides −2007 and −1961. ChIP analysis confirmed agonist-dependent binding of LXRα, PPARα, and RXRα to this hormone response element complex (HREc). A luciferase reporter containing the 2 kb 5′ APOF sequence was negatively regulated by LXR and PPARα ligands as seen in cells. This regulation was maintained in constructs lacking the ~1700 nucleotides between the HREc and the APOF proximal promoter. Mutations of the HREc that disrupted LXRα and PPARα binding led to the loss of reporter construct inhibition by agonists of these nuclear receptors. siRNA knockdown studies showed that APOF gene regulation by LXRα or PPARα agonists did not require an interaction between these two nuclear receptors. Thus, APOF is subject to negative regulation by agonist-activated LXR or PPARα nuclear receptors binding to a regulatory element ~1900 bases 5′ to the APOF promoter. High fat, cholesterol-enriched diets likely reduce APOF gene expression via these receptors interacting at this regulatory site.

Abstract: Full thickness models (FTMs) are 3D-cultured human skin models that mimic many aspects of native human skin (NHS). However, their stratum corneum (SC) lipid composition differs from NHS causing a reduced skin barrier. The most pronounced differences in lipid composition are a reduction in lipid chain length and increased monounsaturated lipids. The liver-X-receptor (LXR) activates the monounsaturated lipid synthesis via stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1). Therefore, the aim was to improve the SC lipid synthesis of FTMs by LXR deactivation. This was achieved by supplementing culture medium with LXR antagonist GSK2033. LXR agonist T0901317 was added for comparison. Subsequently, epidermal morphogenesis, lipid composition, lipid organization and the barrier functionality of these FTMs were assessed. We demonstrate that LXR deactivation resulted in a lipid composition with increased overall chain lengths and reduced levels of monounsaturation, whereas LXR activation increased the amount of monounsaturated lipids and led to a reduction in the overall chain length. However, these changes did not affect the barrier functionality. In conclusion, LXR deactivation led to the development of FTMs with improved lipid properties, which mimic the lipid composition of NHS more closely. These novel findings may contribute to design interventions to normalize SC lipid composition of atopic dermatitis patients.

Abstract: Background
To our knowledge, we lack a complete understanding of the lipidomes alterations caused by maternal supraphysiological hypercholesterolemia (MSPH) at the third trimester.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to investigate lipidomes alterations in maternal and umbilical venous (UV) serum and explore the association between these alterations and MSPH.
Methods
We conducted a nest case-control study between maternal physiological hypercholesterolemia (MPH) and MSPH subjects during pregnancy. Lipidomic profiling of maternal serum at the first trimester of gestation and UV serum was performed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography system connected to a quadrupole time-of-light/mass spectrometer.
Results
Several glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids (C18 sphingoid base) species were distinctly altered in maternal serum and/or UV serum with MSPH versus MPH. Glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and propanoate metabolism were the main pathways that involved the most of discriminate metabolites. Higher HDL-c and phosphatidylcholine (16:0/0:0) (PC (16:0/0:0)) during pregnancy, higher PC (16:0/0:0) and lower cholesterol ester 20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z) (CE (20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z))) in the UV serum may be the risk factors for the increased placental circulation resistance. The total cholesterol levels of maternal serum both at the first trimester and at the third trimester were significantly correlated with some lipid species of UV serum.
Conclusion
This study clarifies the differential lipid profiles to distinguish MSPH from MPH and the pathway which is influenced under the condition of MSPH. Also, it provides a resource to look for potential therapeutic targets for MSPH.

Abstract: The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during obesity are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1–5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell–cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.

Abstract: CGL type 2 is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by an almost complete lack of body fat. CGL is caused by loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the BSCL2 gene that codifies to seipin. Subjects often show hyperglycemia, decreased HDL-c, and hypoadiponectinemia. These laboratory findings are important triggers for changes in redox and ER homeostasis. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether these intracellular mechanisms are associated with this syndrome. We collected blood from people from Northeastern Brazil with 0, 1, and 2 mutant alleles for the rs786205071 in the BSCL2 gene. Through the qPCR technique, we evaluated the expression of genes responsible for triggering the antioxidant response, DNA repair, and ER stress in leukocytes. Colorimetric tests were applied to quantify lipid peroxidation and to evaluate the redox status of glutathione, as well as to access the panorama of energy metabolism. Long extension PCR was performed to observe leukocyte mitochondrial DNA lesions, and the immunoblot technique to investigate plasma adiponectin concentrations. Subjects with the rs786205071 in both BSCL2 alleles showed increased transcription of NFE2L2, APEX1, and OGG1 in leukocytes, as well as high concentrations of malondialdehyde and the GSSG:GSH ratio in plasma. We also observed increase of mitochondrial DNA lesions and XBP1 splicing, as well as a decrease in adiponectin and HDL-c. Our data suggest the presence of lipid lesions due to changes in redox homeostasis in that group, associated with increased levels of mitochondrial DNA damage and transcriptional activation of genes involved with antioxidant response and DNA repair.

Abstract: Eosinophils are important multifaceted effector cells involved in allergic inflammation. Following allergen challenge, eosinophils and other immune cells release secreted phospholipases, generating lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). LPCs are potent lipid mediators, and serum levels of LPCs associate with asthma severity, suggesting a regulatory activity of LPCs in asthma development. As of yet, the direct effects of LPCs on eosinophils remain unclear. In the present study, we tested the effects of the major LPC species (16:0, 18:0 and 18:1) on eosinophils isolated from healthy human donors. Addition of saturated LPCs in the presence of albumin rapidly disrupted cholesterol-rich nanodomains on eosinophil cell membranes and suppressed multiple eosinophil effector responses, such as CD11b upregulation, degranulation, chemotaxis, and downstream signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a mouse model of allergic cell recruitment, that LPC treatment markedly reduces immune cell infiltration into the lungs. Our observations suggest a strong modulatory activity of LPCs in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Ultrahigh-performance supercritical fluid chromatography - mass spectrometry (UHPSFC/MS), ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) - MS techniques were used for the lipidomic characterization of exosomes isolated from human plasma. The high-throughput methods UHPSFC/MS and UHPLC/MS using a silica-based column containing sub-2 μm particles enabled the lipid class separation and the quantitation based on exogenous class internal standards in <7 minute run time. MALDI provided the complementary information on anionic lipid classes, such as sulfatides. The nontargeted analysis of 12 healthy volunteers was performed, and absolute molar concentration of 244 lipids in exosomes and 191 lipids in plasma belonging to 10 lipid classes were quantified. The statistical evaluation of data included principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis, S-plots, p-values, T-values, fold changes, false discovery rate, box plots, and correlation plots, which resulted in the information on lipid changes in exosomes in comparison to plasma. The major changes were detected in the composition of triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, and lysophosphatidylcholines, whereby sphingomyelins, phosphatidylinositols, and sulfatides showed rather similar profiles in both biological matrices.

Abstract: Lipid metabolic abnormalities have received intensified concerns and increased de novo synthesis of lipids is recognized as a common feature of many human cancers. Nevertheless, the role of lipid metabolism that confers aggressive properties on human cancers still remains to be revealed. Natural compounds represent an abundant pool of agents for the discovery of novel lead compounds. Trichothecin (TCN) is a sesquiterpenoid originating from an endophytic fungus of the herbal plant Maytenus hookeri Loes. Here, we assess the association of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) over-expression with malignant progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Based on this association, the effect of TCN on migration and invasion of colon carcinoma cells closely related to the inhibition of SCD-1 is evaluated. We further demonstrate that reduced production of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) by blocking SCD-1 activity is beneficial for the anti-invasion effect of TCN. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanistic connection between metabolite alterations induced by metabolic rewiring and the aggressive tumor phenotype and further develop novel pharmacological tools for the intervention of tumor invasion associated with SCD-1-mediated metabolite alterations.

Abstract: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, butyrate, and propionate, are produced when colonic bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract ferment undigested fibers. Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) and FFA3 are G-protein-coupled receptors recently identified as SCFA receptors that may modulate inflammation. We previously showed through in vitro experiments that SCFAs activate FFA2 and FFA3, thereby mitigating inflammation in human renal cortical epithelial cells. This study used a murine model of adenine-induced renal failure to investigate whether or not SCFAs can prevent the progression of renal damage. We also examined whether or not these FFA2 and FFA3 proteins have some roles in this protective mechanism in vivo. Immunohistochemical analyses of mouse kidneys showed that FFA2 and FFA3 proteins were expressed mainly in the distal renal tubules and collecting tubules. First, we observed that the administration of propionate mitigated the renal dysfunction and pathological deterioration caused by adenine. Consistent with this, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis-related genes was reduced. Furthermore, the mitigation of adenine-induced renal damage by the administration of propionate was significantly attenuated in FFA2−/− and FFA3−/− mice. Therefore, the administration of propionate significantly protects against adenine-induced renal failure, at least in part, via the FFA2 and FFA3 pathways. Our data suggest that FFA2 and FFA3 are potential new therapeutic targets for preventing or delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: In Barth syndrome (BTHS) mutations in tafazzin leads to changes in both the quantities and the molecular species of cardiolipin (CL), which are the hallmarks of BTHS. Contrary to the well-established alterations in CL associated with BTHS; recently a marked decrease in the plasmalogen levels in Barth specimens has been identified. To restore the plasmalogen levels, the present study reports the effect of promotion of plasmalogen biosynthesis on the lipidome of lymphoblasts derived from Barth patients as well as on cell viability, mitochondria biogenesis, and mitochondrial membrane potential. High resolution 31P NMR phospholipidomic analysis showed an increase in the levels of plasmenylethanolamine (the major plasmalogen in lymphoblasts), which reached values comparable to the control and a compensatory decrease in the levels of its diacyl-PE counterpart. Importantly, 31P NMR showed a significant increase in the levels of CL, while not altering the levels of monolysocardiolipin. Mass spectrometry measurements showed that the promotion of plasmalogen biosynthesis did not change the molecular species profile of targeted phospholipids. In addition, promotion of plasmalogen biosynthesis did not impact on cellular viability, although it significantly decrease mitochondria copy number and restored mitochondrial membrane potential. Overall, the results showed the efficacy of the promotion of plasmalogen biosynthesis on increasing the CL levels in a BTHS cell model and highlight the potential beneficial effect of a diet supplemented with plasmalogen precursors to BTHS patients.

Abstract: The contribution of individual lipoprotein species to the generation of the adrenal cholesterol pool used for the synthesis of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid species remains unknown. Here we examined the impact of specific lowering of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density (LDL) levels on adrenal cholesterol and glucocorticoid homeostasis. Hereto, lethally-irradiated hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E (APOE) knockout mice received APOE-containing bone marrow from wild-type mice (n = 6) or APOE knockout control bone marrow (n = 10) and were subsequently fed a regular chow diet. Transplantation with wild-type bone marrow was associated with a 10-fold decrease in VLDL/LDL-cholesterol levels. No changes were observed in adrenal weights, adrenal cholesterol content, or basal plasma corticosterone levels. However, food deprivation-induced corticosterone secretion was 64% lower (P < 0.05) in wild-type bone marrow recipients as compared to APOE knockout bone marrow recipients, in the context of similar plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. A parallel 19–29% decrease in adrenal relative mRNA expression levels of ACTH-responsive genes SR-BI (P < 0.01), STAR (P < 0.05), and CYP11A1 (P < 0.05) was detected. In support of relative glucocorticoid insufficiency, blood lymphocyte and eosinophil concentrations were respectively 2.4-fold (P < 0.01) and 8-fold (P < 0.001) higher in wild-type bone marrow recipients under food deprivation stress conditions. In conclusion, we have shown that a selective lowering of VLDL/LDL levels in APOE knockout mice through a transplantation with APOE-containing wild-type bone marrow is associated with a decreased maximal adrenal glucocorticoid output. Our studies provide experimental support for the hypothesis that, in vivo, VLDL/LDL serves as the primary source of cholesterol used for glucocorticoid synthesis during food deprivation stress.

Abstract: Macrophages are the effector immune cells with plasticity to differentiate as M1 (classically activated) and M2 (alternatively activated) phenotypes. Prostaglandins (PGs) have various important roles and are involved in the regulation of macrophage activation. However, the role of PGF2α in macrophage activation remains unclear. We investigated the role of PGF2α receptor (FP)-mediated signaling in the M1 macrophage polarization using murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon (IFN)-γ increased the mRNA expression of the M1 macrophage markers such as inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and CD11c. Pre-treatment with AL8810, an FP receptor antagonist, further enhanced the expression of these genes. In contrast, treatment with fluprostenol, an FP receptor agonist, decreased the LPS + IFN-γ-induced expression of M1 markers. LPS-induced M1 macrophage polarization was dependent on the activation of NF-κB p65. Treatment with IκB kinase β inhibitor reduced AL8810-induced mRNA expression of the M1 markers. Stimulation with LPS + IFN-γ increased the expression of IL-10. Pre-treatment with AL8810 lowered LPS + IFN-γ-induced IL-10 expression, and further enhanced LPS + IFN-γ-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. In contrast, co-treatment with IL-10 reversed AL8810-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. These results indicate that the FP receptor signaling was involved in the control of M1 polarization of macrophages via IL-10-regulated nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65.

Abstract: Obesity is characterized by uncontrolled expansion of adipose tissue mass, resulting in adipocyte hypertrophy (increased adipocyte size) and hyperplasia (increased number of adipocytes). The number of adipose cells is directly related to adipocyte differentiation process from stromal vascular cells to mature adipocytes. It is known that epigenetic factors influence adipose differentiation program. However, how specific epigenome modifiers affect white adipocyte differentiation and metabolic phenotype is still matter of research. Here, we provide evidence that class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved both in the differentiation of adipocytes and in determining the metabolic features of these cells. We demonstrate that inhibition of class I HDACs from the very first stage of differentiation amplifies the differentiation process and imprints cells toward a highly oxidative phenotype. These effects are related to the capacity of the inhibitor to modulate H3K27 acetylation on enhancer regions regulating Pparg and Ucp1 genes. These epigenomic modifications result in improved white adipocyte functionality and metabolism and induce browning. Collectively, our results show that modulation of class I HDAC activity regulates the metabolic phenotype of white adipocytes via epigenetic imprinting on a key histone mark.

Abstract: Curcumin, a hydrophobic polyphenol found in the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has been shown to reduce intracellular lipid accumulation in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann-Pick type C. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles secreted by cells in response to changes in intracellular ceramide composition. Curcumin can induce exosome/microvesicle release in cellular models of lipid deposition; however, the mechanism by which curcumin stimulates this release is unknown. In a model of lipid trafficking impairment in C6 glia cells, we show that curcumin stimulated ceramide synthesis by increasing the intracellular concentration of ceramide-dihydroceramide. Ceramide overload increased exosome/microvesicle secretion 10-fold, thereby reducing the concentration of lipids in the endolysosomal compartment. These effects were blocked by inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase (myriocin) and ceramide synthase (fumonisin B1). It is concluded that the decrease in intracellular lipid deposition induced by curcumin is mediated by increased ceramide synthesis and exosome/microvesicle release. This action may represent an additional health benefit of curcumin.

Abstract: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lower risk of cardiovascular disease. The primary source of EPA and DHA is fatty fish. Plant-derived alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and stearidonic acid (SDA) could provide sustainable land-based alternatives, but their functionality is underexplored. Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) may influence atherogenic processes through changing endothelial cell (EC) function and lowering inflammation. This study compared effects of marine- and plant-derived n-3 FAs on EC inflammatory responses. EA.hy926 cells were exposed to ALA, SDA, EPA or DHA prior to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. All FAs were shown to be incorporated into ECs in a dose-dependent manner. SDA (50 μM) decreased both production and cell-surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1; however EPA and DHA resulted in greater reduction of ICAM-1 production and expression. EPA and DHA also significantly lowered production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. ALA, SDA and DHA (50 μM) all reduced adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to EA.hy926 cells. DHA significantly decreased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB)p105 gene expression and phosphorylated NFκBp65 protein. Both EPA and DHA (50 μM) significantly decreased cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein. Thus, both marine-derived n-3 FAs, particularly DHA, had potent anti-inflammatory effects in this EC model. Of the plant-derived n-3 FAs, SDA showed the greatest inhibition of inflammation. Although neither ALA nor SDA reproduced the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA and DHA in this model, there is some potential for SDA to be a sustainable anti-inflammatory alternative to the marine n-3 FAs.

Conserved mechanism of phospholipid substrate recognition by the P4-ATPase Neo1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae,

Abstract: The type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) thus far characterized are lipid flippases that transport specific substrates, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), from the exofacial leaflet to the cytofacial leaflet of membranes. This transport activity generates compositional asymmetry between the two leaflets important for signal transduction, cytokinesis, vesicular transport, and host-pathogen interactions. Most P4-ATPases function as a heterodimer with a β-subunit from the Cdc50 protein family, but Neo1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its metazoan orthologs lack a β-subunit requirement and it is unclear how these proteins transport substrate. Here we tested if residues linked to lipid substrate recognition in other P4-ATPases also contribute to Neo1 function in budding yeast. Point mutations altering entry gate residues in the first (Q209A) and fourth (S457Q) transmembrane segments of Neo1, where phospholipid substrate would initially be selected, disrupt PS and PE membrane asymmetry, but do not perturb growth of cells. Mutation of both entry gate residues inactivates Neo1, and cells expressing this variant are inviable. We also identified a gain-of-function mutation in the second transmembrane segment of Neo1 (Neo1[Y222S]), predicted to help form the entry gate, that substantially enhances Neo1's ability to replace the function of a well characterized phospholipid flippase, Drs2, in establishing PS and PE asymmetry. These results suggest a common mechanism for substrate recognition in widely divergent P4-ATPases.

Abstract: Mimetic peptides are promising therapeutic agents for atherosclerosis prevention. A 10-residue class G* peptide from apolipoprotein J (apoJ), namely, D-[113–122]apoJ, possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. This prompted us to determine its effect on the aggregation process of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, an early event in the development of atherosclerosis. LDL particles with and without [113–122]apoJ peptide were incubated at 37 °C with sphingomyelinase (SMase) or were left to aggregate spontaneously at room temperature. The aggregation process was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), native gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE), absorbance at 405 nm, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). In addition, circular dichroism was used to determine changes in the secondary structure of apoB, and SDS-PAGE was performed to assess apoB degradation. At an equimolar ratio of [113–122]apoJ peptide to apoB-100, [113–122]apoJ inhibited both SMase-induced or spontaneous LDL aggregation. All methods showed that [113–122]apoJ retarded the progression of SMase-induced LDL aggregation at long incubation times. No effect of [113–122]apoJ on apoB secondary structure was observed. Binding experiments showed that [113–122]apoJ presents low affinity for native LDL but binds readily to LDL during the first stages of aggregation. Laurdan fluorescence experiments showed that mild aggregation of LDL resulted in looser lipid packaging, which was partially prevented by D-[113–122]apoJ. These results demonstrate that [113–122]apoJ peptide prevents SMase-induced LDL aggregation at an equimolar ratio and opens the possibility for the use of this peptide as a therapeutic tool.

Abstract: We previously detected a submicromolar concentration of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in human saliva. Here, we compare LPA concentrations in human gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from patients with periodontitis and healthy controls, and examine how the local LPA levels are regulated enzymatically. The concentrations of LPA and its precursor lysophospholipids in GCF was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The LPA-producing and LPA-degrading enzymatic activities were measured by quantifying the liberated choline and free fatty acid, respectively. The concentration of LPA in GCF of periodontitis patients was lower than that of healthy controls, due to higher soluble lysophospholipase activity toward LPA. LPA was found to prevent survival of Sa3, a human gingival epithelium-derived tumor cell line, activate Sa3 through Ca2+ mobilization, and release interleukin 6 from Sa3 in vitro. Furthermore, local injection of LPA into the gingiva attenuated ligature-induced experimental alveolar bone loss induced by oral bacteria inoculation in a rat model of periodontitis in vivo. A high concentration of LPA in human GCF is necessary to maintain normal gingival epithelial integrity and function, protecting the progression of periodontitis.

Suppression of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase blocks intracellular fatty acid flux and glucose uptake in skeletal myotubes,

Abstract: Alterations in fatty acid metabolism are associated with impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (Acsl) 6 is the one of the Acsl isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle although its role in muscle energy metabolism has not been studied. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the role of Acsl6 in fatty acid partitioning and glucose uptake in differentiated skeletal myotubes using a siRNA-mediated knockdown approach. Compared with cells transfected with control siRNA, cells transfected with Acsl6 siRNA exhibited reduced intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. The initial rate of [1‑14C]‑oleic acid uptake was not altered while the incorporation of [1‑14C]‑acetic acids into total cellular lipids decreased under Acsl6 knockdown (p < 0.05). In a metabolic labeling study, Acsl6 suppression decreased the incorporation of [1‑14C]‑oleic acids and [1‑14C]‑acetic acids into TAG and diacylglycerol (DAG) (p < 0.05). During the chase period of a pulse-chase experiment, Acsl6 suppression increased the intracellular free fatty acids and decreased the fatty acid channeling toward the reacylation of TAG (p < 0.05). The incorporation of the labeled fatty acids into acid-soluble metabolites, β-oxidation product, was not changed under Acsl6 knockdown. Acsl6 siRNA decreased the insulin-induced uptake of [1‑14C]‑2‑deoxyglucose (p < 0.05) but did not change the glucose uptake in the presence of acipimox, inhibitor of lipolysis. Suppression of Acsl6 deteriorated Akt phosphorylation and Glut4 mRNA expression in response to insulin. These results suggest that Acsl6 activates and channels fatty acids toward anabolic pathways and has a role in glucose and fatty acid cycling through the re-esterification of fatty acids in skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Macrophage polarization switches during the course of inflammation along with the lipid mediators released. We investigated the lipid mediator formation in human monocyte-derived macrophages during in vitro differentiation and pathogen stimulation. For this, peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated into M1 (CSF-2/IFNγ) or M2 (CSF-1/IL-4) macrophages followed by stimulation with the toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands zymosan (TLR-2), Poly(I:C) (TLR-3) or bacterial lipopolysaccharides (TLR-4) mimicking fungal, viral and bacterial infection, respectively. Expression of enzymes involved in lipid mediator formation such as 5- and 15-lipoxygenases (LO), the 5-LO activating protein and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was monitored on mRNA and protein level and lipid mediator formation was assessed. In addition, cytokine release was measured. In vitro differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes to M1 and M2 macrophages considerably attenuated 5-LO activity. Furthermore, while TLR-2 and -4 stimulation of M1 macrophages primarily triggered pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators, persistent stimulation (16 h) of human M2 macrophages induced a coordinated upregulation of 5- and 15-LO-2 expression. This was accompanied by a marked increase in IL-10 and monohydroxylated 15-LO products in the conditioned media of the cells. After additional stimulation with Ca2+ ionophore combined with supplementation of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid these cells also released small amounts of SPM such as lipoxins and resolvins. From this we conclude that activation of TLR-2 or -4 triggers the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory 5-LO and COX-2 derived lipid mediators in human monocyte-derived M1 macrophages while persistent stimulation of M2 macrophages induces a shift towards pro-resolving 15-LO derived oxylipins.

Abstract: LiCl is widely prescribed for bipolar disorder but adversely associated with a higher incidence of increased body weight. Here, we investigated effects and underlying mechanisms of LiCl on lipid accumulation. LiCl induced dose-dependent lipid accumulation in HepG2 and RAW264.7 cells under normal as well as high glucose conditions. LiCl exposure additionally promoted lipid accumulation in livers of zebrafish. SB216763, a specific GSK-3β inhibitor, did not affect lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Expression of key lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and aP2, as well as SR-B1 were increased in RAW264.7 cells. LiCl enhanced FAS, ACC and SCD-1 mRNA levels while suppressing CPT-1 in HepG2 cells. LiCl stimulated DNA binding activities of SREBP-1c and ChREBP. LiCl activated AMPK phosphorylation but the AMPK inhibitor, AICAR, did not suppress LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7. LiCl, but not SB216763, induced a significant increase in ROS in RAW264.7 and HepG2 cells. NOX activity was dose-dependently enhanced by LiCl. Furthermore, NOX-1, NOX-2 and DUOX-1 mRNA levels were upregulated at an early stage of LiCl stimulation. LiCl-induced lipid accumulation was suppressed by the antioxidant, NAC, and inhibitors of NOX, DPI and APO. Phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of CREB were enhanced by LiCl. The cell-permeable cAMP analog, di-butyryl cAMP, not only promoted lipid accumulation itself but also LiCl-induced lipid accumulation in RAW264.7 cells. H-89, a PKA inhibitor, suppressed CREB activation, lipid accumulation and NOX activity in RAW264.7 cells. Our results indicate that LiCl stimulates lipid accumulation in hepatocyte and macrophage cells potentially through increased PKA-dependent ROS production.

Abstract: Adverse effects of aging can be delayed with life-style interventions. We examined how exercise training (ET) alone or combined with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) affects serum and adipose tissue (AT) lipidome in older women. Fifty-five sedentary older women were included in the physical activity program and given either sunflower (Placebo) or wax esters-rich (Calanus) oil capsules for 4 months. Serum and subcutaneous abdominal AT samples were acquired while maximum rates of oxygen consumption (VO2 max), insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps) and comprehensive lipidome profiles were determined before and after the study. ET increased VO2 max in both groups. Lipidomics profiling revealed unusual serum triacylglycerols and phospholipids with ether-bound alkyls in the Calanus group, while ET generally induced shorter-chain triacylglycerols in AT, suggesting increased de novo lipogenesis. The latter was positively associated with whole-body insulin sensitivity. Unexpectedly, insulin-sensitizing lipokines from the family of branched palmitic acid esters of hydroxy stearic acid (PAHSAs) were elevated in both serum and AT after ET, while PAHSAs-containing triacylglycerols were detected in AT. ET stimulated beneficial changes in AT, including PAHSAs synthesis. Although the added value of omega-3 PUFA supplementation was not proven, our discovery can help understand the nature of the metabolic benefits of exercise.

Abstract: Brain-specific diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) δ-knockout mice exhibited serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor-sensitive obsessive-compulsive disorder-like behaviors. Moreover, SERT protein levels were markedly increased in the DGKδ-deficient brain. However, its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We found that the catalytic subdomain-a and the coiled-coil structure-containing region of DGKδ interacted with the C-terminal cytoplasmic region (CTC) of SERT. Moreover, the protein levels of full-length SERT and SERT-CTC alone were significantly decreased by DGKδ in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. A proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, inhibited DGKδ-dependent SERT degradation. Notably, DGKδ interacted with MAGE-D1 adaptor protein and Praja-1 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, and enhanced the ubiquitination of SERT through Praja-1. Taken together, these results indicate that DGKδ interacts with SERT and induces SERT degradation in an activity-dependent manner through the Praja-1 ubiquitin ligase-proteasome system. These new findings provide novel insights into serotonergic system regulation and the pathophysiology/therapeutics of serotonin-/SERT-related diseases such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, autism and schizophrenia.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis (AS) is characterized by lipids metabolism disorder and inflammatory response. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Wingless type 5a (Wnt5a) is implicated in cardiovascular diseases through non-canonical Wnt cascades. However, its precise role during the pathogenesis of AS is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role and the underlying mechanism of Wnt5a/receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) pathways in the promotion of AS process through affecting lipid accumulation and inflammation. In atherosclerotic clinical samples, Wnt5a levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. In vivo experiments were conducted by using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE−/−) mice model. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were applied for in vitro studies. Wnt5a was highly expressed in both of atherosclerotic clinical samples and apoE−/− mice. The knockdown of Wnt5a significantly inhibited cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation aggravated the cholesterol accumulation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in VSMCs. Depletion of intracellular cholesterol by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and the inhibition of inflammation. Conversely, the overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited ABCA1 expression, facilitated cholesterol accumulation, impared cholesterol efflux, promoted NF-κB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, the knockdown of Ror2 increased ABCA1 expression and reduced Wnt5a-induced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the knockdown of ABCA1 enhanced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Therefore, Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway was critical in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response, which might be a promising therapeutic target for AS therapy.

Abstract: Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters (CE) from high-density lipoproteins (HDL). An impaired SR-BI function leads to hyperalphalipoproteinemia with elevated levels of cholesterol transported in the HDL fraction. Accumulation of cholesterol in apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins has been shown to alter skin lipid composition and barrier function in mice. To investigate whether these hypercholesterolemic effects on the skin also occur in hyperalphalipoproteinemia, we compared skins of wild-type and SR-BI knockout (SR-BI−/−) mice. SR-BI deficiency did not affect the epidermal cholesterol content and induced only minor changes in the ceramide subclasses. The epidermal free fatty acid (FFA) pool was, however, enriched in short and unsaturated chains. Plasma CE levels strongly correlated with epidermal FFA C18:1 content. The increase in epidermal FFA coincided with downregulation of cholesterol and FFA synthesis genes, suggesting a compensatory response to increased flux of plasma cholesterol and FFAs into the skin. Importantly, the SR-BI−/− epidermal lipid barrier showed increased permeability to ethyl-paraminobenzoic acid, indicating an impairment of the barrier function. In conclusion, increased HDL-cholesterol levels in SR-BI−/− mice can alter the epidermal lipid composition and lipid barrier function similarly as observed in hypercholesterolemia due to elevated levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins.

Abstract: Elevating evidences suggested roles of peptidoglycan (PGN) for the insulin resistance, metabolic inflammation and liver disorders. But, whether PGN affects the occurrence of steatohepatitis remains unclear. Here, we reported that subcutaneous infusion of purified PGN for 4 weeks significantly increased hepatic levels of triglyceride, inflammation and fibrosis in mice fed normal chow. These alterations were associated with raise in circulating triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin content and inflammatory cytokines. PGN significantly increased triglyceride contents as well as lipogenesis related genes in primary hepatocytes or LO2 cells, either in basal or oleic acid treated conditions. Administration of PGN stimulated the expression of NOD2, as well as phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα, leading to subsequent nuclear translocation of p65. Over-expression of NOD2 significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of p65, levels of nuclear PPARγ and SREBP1, followed by increase in triglyceride contents in LO2 cells treated with or without oleic acid. Further, over-expression of NOD2 significantly augmented the up-regulation of PPARγ induced by rosiglitazone. Inhibition of NFκB blocked the effect of NOD2 on the upregulation of PPARγ. Our study demonstrates that PGN stimulates hepatic lipogenesis by NOD2-NFκB-PPARγ signaling. PGN from intestinal microbiota is thus sufficient to induce the progression of steatohepatitis.

Abstract: Triacylglycerols (TG) in milk derive from different sources, and their composition may be influenced by both maternal diet and obesity. We used two rat models to ascertain potential changes in TG composition in milk associated to maternal intake of an obesogenic diet during lactation and to distinguish them from the effects attributable to maternal adiposity. Milk samples were obtained from dams fed a cafeteria diet during lactation (CAF) and from dams made obese by cafeteria diet feeding, with dietary normalization before gestation (PCaf). Levels of specific TG species in milk collected at different time points of lactation were determined by shotgun lipidomics. CAF and PCaf dams presented a greater adiposity than their respective controls. The principal component analysis of TG peaks showed a clear separation between milk from CAF dams and milk from control and Pcaf dams, already evident at 5 days of lactation. Milk from CAF dams was enriched with TG species with greater number of carbons and double bonds and reduced in TG with lower number of carbons. TG composition of milk from Pcaf dams was similar to controls, although specific differences were observed at day 5 of lactation. Thus, the intake of a cafeteria diet during lactation, rather than maternal adiposity, alters milk composition. This effect is avoided with dietary normalization before gestation, although the remaining fat reserves may also influence TG composition at initial stages of lactation. Therefore, normalization of maternal diet prior to pregnancy should be considered as a strategy for achieving optimal milk composition.

Abstract: Background and aims
Fargesin mainly functions in the improvement of lipid metabolism and the inhibition of inflammation, but the role of fargesin in atherogenesis and the molecular mechanisms have not been defined. We aimed to explore if and how fargesin affects atherosclerosis by regulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory response.
Methods and results
ApoE−/− mice were fed a high-fat diet to form atherosclerotic plaques and then administrated with fargesin or saline via gavage. Oil Red O, HE and Masson staining were performed to assess atherosclerostic plaques in apoE−/− mice. [3H] labeled cholesterol was used to detect cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) efficiency. Enzymatic methods were performed to analyze plasma lipid profile in apoE−/− mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze macrophage infiltration. THP-1-derived macrophages were incubated with fargesin or not. Both Western blot and qRT-PCR were applied to detect target gene expression. Oil Red O staining was applied to examine lipid accumulation in THP-1-derived macrophages. ELISA and qRT-PCR were used to examine the levels of inflammatory mediotors. We found that fargesin reduced atherosclerotic lesions by elevating efficiency of RCT and decreasing inflammatory response via upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in apoE−/− mice. Further, fargesin reduced lipid accumulation in THP-1-derived macrophages. Besides, fargesin increased phosphorylation of CEBPα in Ser21 and then upregulated LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in THP-1-derived macrophages. In addition, fargesin could reduce ox-LDL-induced inflammatory response by inactivation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.
Conclusion
These results suggest that fargesin inhibits atherosclerosis by promoting RCT process and reducing inflammatory response via CEBPαS21/LXRα and TLR4/NF-κB pathways, respectively.

Abstract: The mitochondrial phospholipid (CL) has been linked to mitochondrial and cellular functions. It has been postulated that the composition of CL is of impact for mitochondrial energy metabolism and cell proliferation. Although a correlation between CL composition and proliferation could be demonstrated for several cell types, evidence for a causal relationship remains obscure. Here, we applied two independent approaches, i) supplementation of fatty acids and ii) knock-out of the phospholipid remodeling enzyme tafazzin, to manipulate CL composition and analyzed the response on proliferation of C6 glioma cells. Both strategies caused substantial changes in the distribution of cellular fatty acids as well as in the distribution of fatty acids incorporated in CL that were accompanied by changes of the composition of molecular CL species. These changes did not correlate with cell proliferation. However, knock-out of tafazzin caused dramatic reduction in proliferation of C6 glioma cells independent of CL composition. The mechanism of tafazzin-dependent restriction of proliferation remains unclear. Among the various fatty acids administered only palmitic acid restricted cell proliferation by induction of cell death.

Abstract: The exact role of VD deficiency in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unknown. In this study, we induced VD deficiency by feeding Female Sprague-Dawley rats a VD deficient (VDD) Diet and studied the hepatic changes associated with VD deficiency. Simultaneously, we provided the VDD rats with VD or 8-methoxy psoralen (8-MOP), a suggested vitamin D receptor agonist, to test the reversibility of the hepatic changes. VDD Rats developed borderline non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with considerable elevation in hepatic triglycerides, total cholesterol, and malondialdehyde. Furthermore, VD deficiency induced the expression of crucial enzymes and transcription factors involved in denovo lipogenesis, which justified the hepatic lipid accumulation. Insulin receptor signaling was affected by VD deficiency, demonstrated by the elevation in insulin substrate-1 (IRS1) and reduction in insulin substrate-2 (IRS2) signaling. Treatment with VD or 8-MOP attenuated IRS1 signaling and its downstream targets, leading to a decline in de novo lipogenesis, while the elevation in IRS2 expression resulted in the nuclear exclusion of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and diminished gluconeogenesis, a vital source of acetyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis. Moreover, 8-MOP and Calcipotriol modulated insulin signaling in human hepatocyte cell line L02, which highlighted the crucial role of VD in the regulation of hepatic lipid contents in rats and humans. Silencing of the vitamin D receptor expression in L02 diminished the inhibitory effect of Calcipotriol and 8-MOP on fatty acid synthase and acetyl- CoA carboxylase 1 and provided the evidence that 8-MOP actions mediated via vitamin D receptor.

Abstract: Patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) suffer from inflamed skin and skin barrier defects. Proper formation of the outermost part of the skin, the stratum corneum (SC), is crucial for the skin barrier function. In this study we analyzed the localization and activity of lipid enzymes β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) in the skin of AD patients and controls. Localization of both the expression and activity of GBA and ASM in the epidermis of AD patients was altered, particularly at lesional skin sites. These changes aligned with the altered SC lipid composition. More specifically, abnormal localization of GBA and ASM related to an increase in specific ceramide subclasses [AS] and [NS]. Moreover we related the localization of the enzymes to the amounts of SC ceramide subclasses and free fatty acids (FFAs). We report a correlation between altered localization of active GBA and ASM and a disturbed SC lipid composition. Localization of antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3) and AD biomarker Thymus and Activation Regulated Chemokine (TARC) also appeared to be diverging in AD skin compared to control. This research highlights the relation between correct localization of expressed and active lipid enzymes and a normal SC lipid composition for a proper skin barrier.

Abstract: Hemichannels formed by connexins mediate the exchange of ions and signaling molecules between the cytoplasm and the extracellular milieu. Under physiological conditions hemichannels have a low open probability, but in certain pathologies their open probability increases, which can result in cell damage. Pathological conditions are characterized by the production of a number of proinflammatory molecules, including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), one of the most common lipid peroxides produced in response to inflammation and oxidative stress. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether 4-HNE modulates the activity of Cx46 hemichannels. We found that 4-HNE (100 μM) reduced the rate of 4′,6-diamino-2-fenilindol (DAPI) uptake through hemichannels formed by recombinant human Cx46 fused to green fluorescent protein, an inhibition that was reversed partially by 10 mM dithiothreitol. Immunoblot analysis showed that the recombinant Cx46 expressed in HeLa cells becomes carbonylated after exposure to 4-HNE, and that 10 mM dithiothreitol reduced its carbonylation. We also found that Cx46 was carbonylated by 4-HNE in the lens of a selenite-induced cataract animal model. The exposure to 100 μM 4-HNE decreased hemichannel currents formed by recombinant rat Cx46 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This inhibition also occurred in a mutant expressing only the extracellular loop cysteines, suggesting that other Cys are not responsible for the hemichannel inhibition by carbonylation. This work demonstrates for the first time that Cx46 is post-translationally modified by a lipid peroxide and that this modification reduces Cx46 hemichannel activity.

Abstract: Perinatal and long-term offspring morbidities are strongly dependent on the preservation of placental vascular homeostasis during pregnancy. In adults, the HDL-apoM-S1P complex protects the endothelium and maintains vascular integrity. However, the metabolism and biology of cord blood-derived HDLs (referred to as neonatal HDL, nHDL) strikingly differ from those in adults. Here, we investigate the role of neonatal HDLs in the regulation of placental vascular function. We show that nHDL is a major carrier of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is anchored to the particle through apoM (rs = 0.90, p < 0.0001) in the fetal circulation. Furthermore, this complex interacts with S1P receptors on the feto-placental endothelium and activates specifically extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK) and phospholipase C (PLC) downstream signaling, promotes endothelial cell proliferation and calcium flux. Notably, the nHDL-S1P complex triggers actin filaments reorganization, leading to an enhancement of placental endothelial barrier function. Additionally, nHDL induces vasorelaxation of isolated placental chorionic arteries. Taken together, these results suggest that circulating nHDL exerts vasoprotective effects on the feto-placental endothelial barrier mainly via S1P signaling.

Abstract: The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a rat-sized mammal, which is more closely related to humans than mice and rats. However, the use of tree shrew to explore the patho-mechanisms of human inflammatory disorders has been limited since nothing is known about eicosanoid metabolism in this mammalian species. Eicosanoids are important lipid mediators exhibiting pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, which are biosynthesized via lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. When we searched the tree shrew genome for the presence of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase isoforms we found copies of functional COX1, COX2 and LOX genes. Interestingly, we identified four copies of ALOX15 genes, which encode for four structurally distinct ALOX15 orthologs (tupALOX15a-d). To explore the catalytic properties of these enzymes we expressed tupALOX15a and tupALOX15c as catalytically active proteins and characterized their enzymatic properties. As predicted by the Evolutionary Hypothesis of ALOX15 specificity we found that the two enzymes converted arachidonic acid predominantly to 12S-HETE and they also exhibited membrane oxygenase activities. However, their reaction kinetic properties (KM for arachidonic acid and oxygen, T- and pH-dependence) and their substrate specificities were remarkably different. In contrast to mice and humans, tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms are highly expressed in the brain suggesting a role of these enzymes in cerebral function. The genomic multiplicity and the tissue expression patterns of tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms need to be considered when the results of in vivo inflammation studies obtained in this animal are translated into the human situation.

Abstract: Besides energy storage and membrane biogenesis, lipids are known for their numerous biological functions. The two essential lipids, diacylglycerol (DG) and phosphatidic acid (PA), are shown to be associated with cell signalling processes. In this study, we examined whether triglyceride-deficient yeast mutants (tgΔ), dga1Δ and dga1Δlro1Δ, may play an important role in mevalonate (MEV) pathway regulation. Our metabolite analyses revealed that tgΔ cells showed high levels of squalene (SQ) and ergosterol (ERG), which are key indicators of MEV pathway activity. In addition, gene expression studies indicated that the MEV pathway genes in tgΔ cells were significantly upregulated. Interestingly, tgΔ cells exhibited high diacylglycerol kinase1 (DGK1) expression. Furthermore, DGK1 overexpression in WT and tgΔ phenotypes causes a substantial elevation in SQ and ERG levels, and we also found a significant increase in transcript levels of MEV pathway genes, confirming the new role of DGK1 in MEV pathway regulation. This suggests that high DG phosphorylation activity increases the PA pool that may induce the upregulation of MEV pathway in tgΔ cells. The induced MEV pathway is one of the key strategies in the field of synthetic biology for improved production of terpenoids in yeast. Thus, to examine whether increased endogenous MEV pathway flux can be redirected to triterpenoid, β-Amyrin synthase gene was heterologously expressed in DGK1 overexpressing tgΔ cells that led to significant production of β-Amyrin, a natural triterpenoid. In conclusion, our findings provide a novel strategy to increase MEV pathway precursors by modulating endogenous signal lipids for improved production of terpenoids.

Abstract: STARD4, a member of the evolutionarily conserved START gene family, is a soluble sterol transport protein implicated in cholesterol sensing and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. STARD4 is widely expressed and has been shown to transfer sterol between liposomes as well as organelles in cells. However, STARD4 knockout mice lack an obvious phenotype, so the overall role of STARD4 is unclear. To model long term depletion of STARD4 in cells, we use short hairpin RNA technology to stably decrease STARD4 expression in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells (STARD4-KD). We show that STARD4-KD cells display increased total cholesterol, slower cholesterol trafficking between the plasma membrane and the endocytic recycling compartment, and increased plasma membrane fluidity. These effects can all be rescued by transient expression of a short hairpin RNA-resistant STARD4 construct. Some of the cholesterol increase was due to excess storage in late endosomes or lysosomes. To understand the effects of reduced STARD4, we carried out transcriptional and lipidomic profiling of control and STARD4-KD cells. Reduction of STARD4 activates compensatory mechanisms that alter membrane composition and lipid homeostasis. Based on these observations, we propose that STARD4 functions as a critical sterol transport protein involved in sterol sensing and maintaining lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Solid tumors are characterized by global metabolic alterations which contribute to their growth and progression. Altered gene expression profiles and plasma lipid composition suggested a role for metabolic reprogramming in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. However, a conclusive picture of CRC-associated lipidome alterations in the tumor tissue has not emerged. Here, we determined molar abundances of 342 species from 20 lipid classes in matched biopsies of CRC and adjacent normal mucosa. We demonstrate that in contrast to previous reports, CRC shows a largely preserved lipidome composition that resembles that of normal colonic mucosa. Important exceptions include increased levels of lyso-phosphatidylinositols in CRC and reduced abundance of ether phospholipids in advanced stages of CRC. As such, our observations challenge the concept of widespread alterations in lipid metabolism in CRC and rather suggest changes in the cellular lipid profile that are limited to selected lipids involved in signaling and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species.

Abstract: Objective
Highly elevated plasma levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) are causally associated with “Disappearing HDL Syndrome” and low plasma LDL-cholesterol, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Fluid-phase endocytosis, a process highly dependent on actin dynamics, enables cells to internalize relatively high amounts of extracellular fluids and solutes. We sought to investigate whether IL-10 induces lipoprotein uptake by fluid-phase endocytosis in macrophages.
Methods and results
Macrophages (RAW264.7, Kupffer and human) were incubated with vehicle (PBS) or IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for 7 days. Uptake of HDL, LDL, and/or fluid-phase endocytosis probes (albumin-Alexa680®, 70 kDa FITC-Dextran and Lucifer Yellow, LY) was evaluated by FACS. Intracellular cofilin and phosphorylated cofilin (p-cofilin) levels were determined by immunoblotting. Macrophage uptake of lipoproteins and probes was non-saturable and increased after IL-10 incubation (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, pre-incubation with fluid-phase endocytosis inhibitors (LY294002, Latrunculin A, and Amiloride) significantly reduced uptake (p < 0.05). IL-10 increased the cofilin/p-cofilin ratio (p = 0.021), signifying increased cofilin activation and hence filamentous actin. Consistently, phalloidin staining revealed increased filamentous actin in macrophages after IL-10 treatment (p = 0.0018). Finally, RNA-seq analysis demonstrated enrichment of gene sets related to actin filament dynamics, membrane ruffle formation and endocytosis in IL-10-treated macrophages (p < 0.05). IL-10 did not alter mRNA levels of Ldlr, Vldlr, Scarb1, Cd36 or Lrp1. In primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine Kupffer cells, IL-10 incubation also increased uptake of lipoproteins, albumin and LY (p < 0.01).
Conclusions
Interleukin-10 induces the uptake of HDL and LDL by fluid-phase endocytosis by increasing actin-filament rearrangement in macrophages, thus providing a plausible mechanism contributing to “Disappearing HDL Syndrome”.

Abstract: Previous studies demonstrated that loss of CL in the yeast mutant crd1Δ leads to perturbation of mitochondrial iron‑sulfur (FeS) cluster biogenesis, resulting in decreased activity of mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S-requiring enzymes, including aconitase and sulfite reductase. In the current study, we show that crd1Δ cells exhibit decreased levels of glutamate and cysteine and are deficient in the essential antioxidant, glutathione, a tripeptide of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol essential for maintaining intracellular redox potential in almost all eukaryotes, including yeast. Consistent with glutathione deficiency, the growth defect of crd1Δ cells at elevated temperature was rescued by supplementation of glutathione or glutamate and cysteine. Sensitivity to the oxidants iron (FeSO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was rescued by supplementation of glutathione. The decreased intracellular glutathione concentration in crd1Δ was restored by supplementation of glutamate and cysteine, but not by overexpressing YAP1, an activator of expression of glutathione biosynthetic enzymes. These findings show for the first time that CL plays a critical role in regulating intracellular glutathione metabolism.

Abstract: His596 of human ALOX12 has been suggested to interact with the COO−-group of arachidonic acid during ALOX catalysis. In mammalian ALOX15 orthologs Gln596 occupies this position and this amino acid exchange might contribute to the functional differences between the two ALOX-isoforms. To explore the role of Gln596 for ALOX15 functionality we mutated this amino acid to different residues in rabbit and human ALOX15 and investigated the impact of these mutations on structural, catalytic and allosteric enzyme properties. To shed light on the molecular basis of the observed functional alterations we performed in silico substrate docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations and also explored the impact of Gln596 exchange on the protein structure. The combined theoretical and experimental data suggest that Gln596 may not directly interact with the COO−-group of arachidonic acid. In contrast, mutations at Gln596 destabilize the secondary and tertiary structure of ALOX15 orthologs, which may be related to a disturbance of the electrostatic interaction network with other amino acids in the immediate surrounding. Moreover, our MD-simulations suggest that the geometry of the dimer interface depends on the structure of substrate bound inside the substrate-binding pocket and that Gln596Ala exchange impairs the allosteric properties of the enzyme. Taken together, these data indicate the structural and functional importance of Gln596 for ALOX15 catalysis.

Abstract: Pancreatic lipase (PNLIP) is a digestive enzyme that is a potential drug target for the treatment of obesity. A better understanding of its regulation mechanisms would facilitate the development of new therapeutics. Recent studies indicate that intestinal lipolysis by PNLIP is reduced by Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), whose N-terminal domain (nANGPTL4) is a known inactivator of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in blood circulation and adipocytes. To elucidate the mechanism of PNLIP inhibition by ANGPTL4, we developed a novel approach, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The obtained results were compared with those of well-described inhibitors of PNLIP – ε-polylysine (EPL), (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and tetrahydrolipstatin. We demonstrate that ITC allows to investigate PNLIP inhibition mechanisms in complex substrate emulsions and that the ITC-based assay is highly sensitive - the lowest concentration for quantification of PNLIP is 1.5 pM. Combining ITC with surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence measurements, we present evidence that ANGPTL4 is a lipid-binding protein that influences PNLIP activity through interactions with components of substrate emulsions (bile salts, phospholipids and triglycerides), and this promotes the aggregation of triglyceride emulsions similarly to the PNLIP inhibitors EPL and EGCG. In the absence of substrate emulsion, unlike in the case of LPL, ANGPTL4 did not induce the inactivation of PNLIP. Our data also prove that due to various interactions with components of substrate systems, the effect of a PNLIP inhibitor depends on whether its effect is measured in a complex substrate emulsion or in a simple substrate system.

Abstract: In many γ-proteobacteria, FadR is recognized as a global transcriptional regulator: in addition to being the most prominent regulator for FA biosynthesis and degradation, the protein also mediates expression of many genes in diverse biological processes. In Shewanella oneidensis, a bacterium renowned for its respiratory versatility, FadR directly controls only a few genes. However, the FadR loss substantially increases BCFA contents and impairs growth. In this study, we showed that FadR is required to activate a number of important FA biosynthesis genes, including fabA, fabB, and fabH1. Although most of these genes are controlled by FadR in a direct manner, they are not critically responsible for the phenotypes resulting from the FadR depletion. Subsequent investigations identified BKD encoded by the bkd operon as the critical factor for enhanced BCFA production. In the absence of FadR, the bkd operon is derepressed, resulting in elevated conversion of 3MOP to 3-methylbutanoyl-CoA, one of the direct substrates for BCFA synthesis. We further showed that the growth defect of the fadR mutant is due to BCAA shortage, a scenario also attributable to excessive BKD: 3MOP, the common substrate for both BCFA and BCAA, is disproportionately used for BCFA synthesis, leading to reduced production of BCAA. Collectively, our findings reveal that the S. oneidensis FadR regulon is surely larger than previously proposed and a new mechanism by which FadR impacts bacterial physiology.

Abstract: The dermal adipocytes, superficial fascia and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) exist in the interspaces between the dermis and muscular fascia. They are adjacent to each other and traditionally recognized as one SAT. Recently, the dermal adipocyte was redefined as a unique population independent from the SAT. Also, we identified a novel type of adipogenic progenitors in rat superficial fascia. This study aimed to examine cytological and functional characteristics of fascial adipocytes in rats. Superficial fascia had no adipocytes in neonatal rats but gradually appeared numbers of adipocytes in growing rats. Adipogenic progenitors were found to reside in fascia and had strong ability in spontaneous and induced adipogenic differentiation in vitro. Differentiated fascial adipocytes versus subcutaneous or visceral adipocytes expressed increased adipose triglyceride lipase but decreased beta-adrenoreceptor, perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), thus having high basal lipolysis but low lipolysis response to catecholamines. Phosphorylation of perilipin-1 and HSL and translocation of HSL to lipid droplets were attenuated in response to catecholamines rather than post-adrenoreceptoral lipolytic stimulators. The results suggested that superficial fascia was an origin of adipocytes with distinct developmental, cytological and functional characteristics. We proposed that fascial adipocytes could be considered as a unique population of adipocytes in the body. The fascia origin of adipocytes as an adipogenic model might logically explain fat neogenesis occurred at anatomical locations where originally exist no adipose tissues and thereby no adipose-derived stromal precursors. Also, the special histoanatomical relations and overlaps between the dermis, superficial fascia, SAT, and their adipocytes were discussed.

Abstract: Maternal undernutrition during late gestation accelerates body fat mobilization to provide more energy for foetal growth and development, which unbalances metabolic homeostasis and results in serious lipid metabolism disorder. However, detailed regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, a sheep model was used to explore the regulatory role of PPARA/RXRA signalling in hepatic lipid metabolism in undernutrition based on RNA sequencing and cell experiments. KOG function classification showed that lipid transport and metabolism was markedly altered in an undernourished model. In detail, when compared with the controls, fatty acid transport and oxidation and triglyceride metabolism were up-regulated in an undernourished model, while fatty acid synthesis, steroid synthesis, and phospholipid metabolism were down-regulated. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that PPARA/RXRA signalling pathway was altered. Moreover, PPARA signalling associated genes were positively correlated with hepatic non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels, while retinol metabolism associated genes were negatively correlated with blood beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) levels. Results of primary hepatocytes showed that NEFAs could activate PPARA signalling and facilitate fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis, while BHBA could inhibit RXRA signalling and repress FAO and ketogenesis. Excessively accumulated NEFAs in hepatocytes promoted triglyceride synthesis. Furthermore, activation of PPARA/RXRA signalling by WY14643 and 9-cis-retinoic acid could enhance FAO and ketogenesis and reduce NEFAs accumulation and esterification. Our findings elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of NEFAs and BHBA on lipid metabolism as well as the potential role of the PPARA/RXRA signalling pathway in hepatic lipid metabolism, which may contribute to exploring new strategies to maintain lipid metabolic homeostasis in human beings.

Abstract: Several hereditary point mutations in human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) have been associated with low HDL-cholesterol levels and/or increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. However, one apoA-I mutation, the V19L, recently identified in Icelanders, has been associated with increased HDL-cholesterol levels and decreased CAD risk. In an effort to gain mechanistic insight linking the presence of this mutation in apoA-I with the increase of HDL-cholesterol levels we evaluated the effect of V19L mutation on the conformational integrity and functional properties of apoA-I in lipid-free and lipidated form. ApoA-I[V19L] was found to be thermodynamically destabilized in lipid-free form and displays an increased capacity to associate with phospholipids compared to WT apoA-I. When associated to reconstituted HDL (rHDL), apoA-I[V19L] was more thermodynamically stabilized than WT apoA-I. ApoA-I[V19L] displayed normal capacity to promote ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and to activate the enzyme LCAT, in lipid-free and rHDL-associated forms, respectively. Additionally, rHDL-associated apoA-I[V19L] showed normal capacity to promote ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux, but 45% increased capacity to promote SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux, while the SR-BI-mediated HDL-lipid uptake was normal. Overall, our findings show that the apoA-I V19L mutation does not affect the first steps of HDL biogenesis pathway. However, the increased capacity of apoA-I[V19L] to associate with phospholipids, in combination with the enhanced thermodynamic stability of lipoprotein-associated apoA-I[V19L] and increased capacity of apoA-I[V19L]-containing lipoprotein particles to accept additional cholesterol by SR-BI could account for the increased HDL-cholesterol levels observed in human carriers of the mutation.

Abstract: In renal cells, hyperosmolarity can induce cellular stress or differentiation. Both processes require active endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein synthesis. Lipid biosynthesis also occurs at ER surface. We showed that hyperosmolarity upregulates glycerophospholipid (GP) and triacylglycerol (GL-TG) de novo synthesis. Considering that massive synthesis of proteins and/or lipids may drive to ER stress, herein we evaluated whether hyperosmolar environment induces ER stress and the participation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α)-XBP1 in hyperosmotic-induced lipid synthesis. Treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with hyperosmolar medium triggered ER stress-associated unfolded protein response (UPR). Hyperosmolarity significantly increased xbp1 mRNA and protein as function of time; 24 h of treatment raised the spliced form of XBP1 protein (XBP1s) and induced its translocation to nuclear compartment where it can act as a transcription factor. XBP1 silencing or IRE1α ribonuclease (RNAse) inhibition impeded the expression of lipin1, lipin2 and diacylglycerol acyl transferase-1 (DGAT1) enzymes which yielded decreased GL-TG synthesis. The lack of XBP1s also decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) 1 and 2. Together our data demonstrate that hyperosmolarity induces IRE1α → XBP1s activation; XBP1s drives the expression of SREBP1 and SREBP2 which in turn regulates the expression of the lipogenic enzymes lipin1 (LPIN1) and 2 (LPIN2) and DGAT1. We also demonstrated for the first time that tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP), the master regulator of osmoprotective response, regulates XBP1 expression. Thus, XBP1 acts as an osmoprotective protein since it is activated by high osmolarity and upregulates lipid metabolism, membranes generation and the restoration of ER homeostasis

Abstract: Lipid homeostasis allows cells to adjust membrane biophysical properties in response to changes in environmental conditions. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a downward shift in temperature from an optimal reduces membrane fluidity, which triggers a lipid remodeling of the plasma membrane. How changes in membrane fluidity are perceived, and how the abundance and composition of different lipid classes is properly balanced, remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], the most abundant plasma membrane phosphoinositide, drop rapidly in response to a downward shift in temperature. This change triggers a signaling cascade transmitted to cytosolic diphosphoinositol phosphate derivatives, among them 5-PP-IP4 and 1-IP7, that exert regulatory functions on genes involved in the inositol and phospholipids (PLs) metabolism, and inhibit the activity of the protein kinase Pho85. Consistent with this, cold exposure triggers a specific program of neutral lipids and PLs changes. Furthermore, we identified Pho85 as playing a key role in controlling the synthesis of long-chain bases (LCBs) via the Ypk1-Orm2 regulatory circuit. We conclude that Pho85 orchestrates a coordinated response of lipid metabolic pathways that ensure yeast thermal adaptation.

Abstract: Untargeted lipidomics is a powerful tool to discover new biomarkers and to understand the physiology and pathology of lipids. The use of stable isotopes as tracers to investigate the kinetics of lipids is another tool able to supply dynamic information on lipid synthesis and catabolism. Coupling the two methodology is then very appealing in the study of lipid metabolism. The main issue to face is to perform thousands of calculations in order to obtain kinetic parameters starting from the MS raw data. An automated computerized routine able to do accomplish such task is presented in this paper. We analyzed the lipid kinetics of palmitic acid (PA) in hepatoma liver cells cultured in vitro in which insulin resistance has been induced by high glucose supplementation. The deuterated palmitate tracer (d5PA) was administered as a bolus and the cells were harvested daily for 48 h. 5dPA was incorporated into 326 monoisotopic compounds and in 84 of their [M + 1] isotopologues detected by high resolution orbitrap MS. The differences between the kinetics curves showed that at least four long chain triglycerides (TG) species incorporated more PA in glucose treated cells, while phosphocholines, sphingomyelins, mono- and di-glycerides and ceramides (Cer) incorporated less tracer under glucose treatment. Nevertheless, Cer amount was increased by glucose treatment. In conclusion we developed an automated powerful algorithm able to model simultaneously hundreds of kinetic curves obtained in a cell culture spiked with a stable isotope tracer, and to analyze the difference between the two different cell models.

GPR75 receptor mediates 20-HETE-signaling and metastatic features of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells,

Abstract: Purpose
Recent studies have shown that 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) is a key molecule in sustaining androgen-mediated prostate cancer cell survival. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether 20-HETE can affect the metastatic potential of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells, and the implication of the newly described 20-HETE receptor, GPR75, in mediating these effects.
Methods
The expression of GPR75, protein phosphorylation, actin polymerization and protein distribution were assessed by western blot and/or fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, in vitro assays including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity, scratch wound healing, transwell invasion and soft agar colony formation were used to evaluate the effects of 20-HETE agonists/antagonists or GPR75 gene silencing on the aggressive features of PC-3 cells.
Results
20-HETE (0.1 nM) promoted the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by increasing EMT, the release of MMP-2, cell migration and invasion, actin stress fiber formation and anchorage-independent growth. Also, 20-HETE augmented the expression of HIC-5, the phosphorylation of EGFR, NF-κB, AKT and p-38 and the intracellular redistribution of p-AKT and PKCα. These effects were impaired by GPR75 antagonism and/or silencing. Accordingly, the inhibition of 20-HETE formation with N-hydroxy-N′-(4-n-butyl-2-methylphenyl) formamidine (HET0016) elicited the opposite effects.
Conclusions
The present results show for the first time the involvement of the 20-HETE-GPR75 receptor in the activation of intracellular signaling known to be stimulated in cell malignant transformations leading to the differentiation of PC-3 cells towards a more aggressive phenotype. Targeting the 20-HETE/GPR75 pathway is a promising and novel approach to interfere with prostate tumor cell malignant progression.

Abstract: Endothelial lipase (EL) changes structural and functional properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a relevant modulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, but the effect of EL on HDL induced eNOS-activation has not yet been investigated. Here, we examined the impact of EL-modified HDL (EL-HDL) on eNOS activity, subcellular trafficking, and eNOS- dependent vasorelaxation. EL-HDL and empty virus (EV)-HDL as control were isolated from human serum incubated with EL-overexpressing or EV infected HepG2 cells. EL-HDL exhibited higher capacity to induce eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and eNOS activity in EA.hy 926 cells, as well as eNOS-dependent vasorelaxation of mouse aortic rings compared to control HDL. As revealed by confocal and structured illumination-microscopy EL-HDL-driven induction of eNOS was accompanied by an increased eNOS-GFP targeting to the plasma membrane and a lower eNOS-GFP colocalization with Golgi and mitochondria. Widefield microscopy of filipin stained cells revealed that EL-HDL lowered cellular free cholesterol (FC) and as found by thin-layer chromatography increased cellular cholesterol ester (CE) content. Additionally, cholesterol efflux capacity, acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase activity, and HDL particle uptake were comparable between EL-HDL and control HDL. In conclusion, EL increases eNOS activating capacity of HDL, a phenomenon accompanied by an enrichment of the plasma membrane eNOS pool, a decreased cell membrane FC and increased cellular CE content.

Abstract: Iron accumulation has been frequently found in atherosclerotic lesions, especially in macrophages/foam cells, but the exact mechanisms by which hepcidin induces iron retention in plaque macrophages and its roles in atherogenesis remain unknown. Double immunofluorescence staining showed colocalization of hepcidin-positive macrophages with ox-LDL, TLR4, p-p65 and ferritin light chain (ferritin-L) both in human and murine atherosclerotic lesions. RAW264.7 macrophages incubated with ox-LDL showed elevated expression of TLR4, p-p65, hepcidin, ferritin-L/H, CYP27A1, CD36, PPARγ, liver X receptor α (LXRα), and ATP binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), as well as increased intracellular labile iron pool level and lipid accumulation. Ox-LDL-induced iron retention and lipid accumulation were aggravated by lipopolysaccharide but blocked by TAK-242, an antagonist of TLR4. Moreover, macrophage TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation and foaming triggered by ox-LDL was enhanced by ferric ammonium citrate or exogenous hepcidin but attenuated by hepcidin silencing or the use of iron chelator. Meanwhile, the addition of hepcidin stimulated CD36-mediated Dil-labeled-ox-LDL uptake and inhibited the LXRα-ABCA1/G1 pathway-dependent cholesterol efflux in macrophages, which was significantly reversed by 27-hydroxycholesterol but further exacerbated by cyclosporin A, a selective inhibitor of CYP27A1. Our study provided the evidence that iron trapped in atherosclerosis plaque macrophages contributes to cholesterol disequilibrium-initiated foam cell formation, which is provoked by the unique but largely unknown autocrine formation of hepcidin in plaque macrophages via activating the TLR4/NF-κB pathway when exposed to ox-LDL. Such findings, considering the intricate vicious cycle between macrophage hepcidin autocrine-triggered iron retention and cholesterol disequilibrium, may shed new light on the “iron hypothesis” of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Maternal smoking-induced congenital heart and microvascular defects are closely associated with the impaired functioning of the in-utero feto-placental circulation system. Current groundbreaking facts revealed intimate crosstalk between circulating red blood cells (RBCs) and the vascular endothelium. Thus, RBCs have become the protagonists under varied pathological and adverse pro-oxidative cellular stress conditions. We isolated and screened fetal RBCs from the arterial cord blood of neonates, born to non-smoking (RBC-NS) and smoking mothers (RBC-S), assuming that parameters of fetal RBCs are blueprints of conditions experienced in-utero. Using atomic force microscopy and mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics in the RBC-S population we revealed induced membrane stiffness, loss in intrinsic plastic activities and several abnormalities in their membrane-lipid composition, that could consequently result in perturbed hemodynamic flow movements. Altogether, these features are indicative of the outcome of neonatal microvascular complications and suggest unavailability for the potential rescue mechanism in cases of vascular endothelium impairment due to altered membrane integrity and rheological properties.

Abstract: The C. elegans lipase-like 5 (lipl-5) gene is predicted to code for a lipase homologous to the human gastric acid lipase. Its expression was previously shown to be modulated by nutritional or immune cues, but nothing is known about its impact on the lipid landscape and ensuing functional consequences. In the present work, we used mutants lacking LIPL-5 protein and found that lipl-5 is important for normal lipidome composition as well as its remodeling in response to food deprivation. Particularly, lipids with signaling functions such as ceramides and mitochondrial lipids were affected by lipl-5 silencing. In comparison with wild type worms, animals lacking LIPL-5 were enriched in cardiolipins linked to polyunsaturated C20 fatty acids and coenzyme Q-9. Differences in mitochondrial lipid composition were accompanied by differences in mitochondrial activity as mitochondria from well-fed lipl-5 mutants were significantly more able to oxidize respiratory substrates when compared with mitochondria from well-fed wild type worms. Strikingly, starvation elicited important changes in mitochondrial activity in wild type worms, but not in lipl-5 worms. This indicates that this lipase is a determinant of mitochondrial functional remodeling in response to food withdrawal.

Abstract: Sphingosine kinases (SphK) catalyse the formation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and play important roles in the cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems. We have shown before that Gq-coupled receptors induce a rapid and long-lasting translocation of SphK1 to the plasma membrane and cross-activation of S1P receptors. Here, we further addressed Gq regulation of SphK1 by analysing the influence of the WD40 repeat protein, WDR36. WDR36 has been described as a scaffold tethering Gαq to phospholipase C (PLC)-β and the thromboxane A2 receptor-β (TPβ receptor). Overexpression of WDR36 in HEK-293 cells enhanced TPβ receptor-induced inositol phosphate production, as reported (Cartier et al. 2011), but significantly attenuated inositol phosphate production induced by muscarinic M3 and bradykinin B2 receptors. In agreement with its effect on PLCβ, WDR36 augmented TPβ receptor-induced [Ca2+]i increases. Surprisingly, WDR36 also augmented M3 receptor-induced [Ca2+]i increases, which was due to increased Ca2+ mobilization while the Ca2+ content of thapsigargin-sensitive stores remained unaltered. Interestingly, overexpression of WDR36 significantly delayed SphK1 translocation by Gq-coupled M3, B2 and H1 receptors in HEK-293 cells, while TPβ receptor-induced SphK1 translocation was generally slow and not altered by WDR36 in these cells. Finally, in C2C12 myoblasts, overexpression of WDR36 delayed SphK1 translocation induced by B2 receptors. It is concluded that WDR36 reduces signalling of Gq-coupled receptors other than TPβ towards PLC and SphK1, most likely by scavenging Gαq and PLCβ. Our results support a role of WDR36 in orchestration of Gq signalling complexes, and might help to functionally unravel its genetic association with asthma and allergy.

The role of the C-terminal domain of PCSK9 and SEC24 isoforms in PCSK9 secretion,

Abstract: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secretory protein that promotes low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation and thereby regulating plasma levels of LDL cholesterol. Previous studies have revealed the role of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of PCSK9 in its secretion, however, how CTD regulates PCSK9 secretion is not completely understood. Additionally, SEC24A, the cargo adaptor protein of the coat protein complex II, has been implicated in the secretion of mouse PCSK9. Here, we investigated how CTD and SEC24 regulated PCSK9 secretion in humans. We found that mutant PCSK91–528, in which amino acids from 529 to the end (amino acid 692) were deleted, was maturated and secreted from cells as effectively as the wild-type protein. On the other hand, lacking amino acids 454 to 692 in mutant PCSK91–453 significantly reduced its maturation and secretion, but to a lesser extent when compared to mutants PCSK91–446, PCSK91–445 and PCSK91–444, that all markedly impaired PCSK9 maturation. However, mutant PCSK91–444 virtually eliminated PCSK9 secretion while PCSK91–446 and PCSK91–445 could still be adequately detected in culture medium. Interestingly, mutation of Pro445 to other amino acid residues considerably impaired the secretion of mutant PCSK91–445 but not the full-length protein. We also found that natural variants in CTD including S462P, S465L, E482G, R495Q and A522T impaired PCSK9 secretion. Further, the knockdown of SEC24A, SEC24B, SEC24C but not SEC24D reduced secretion of the full-length PCSK9 but not mutant PCSK91–446. Therefore, SEC24A, SEC24B, and SEC24C facilitate endogenous PCSK9 secretion from cultured human hepatocytes, that are most likely mediated by the CTD of PCSK9. Our studies also indicate that the CTD of PCSK9 may allosterically and independently modulate the stability of the hinge region. Collectively, these data revealed that the CTD of PCSK9 and the hinge region play a critical role in PCSK9 maturation and secretion.

Abstract: Dead box helicase 5 (DDX5) is an RNA helicase that is has cellular function on RNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. It has been reported to be involved in cell differentiation including adipogenesis. However, it is not clear how DDX5 is regulated during adipogenesis. Our previous report demonstrated that the Ten-eleven translocation methyl-cytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) is required for adipogenesis. This study was aimed to investigate DDX5 as a direct target of TET2 upon adipogenic induction of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte. Microarray-based screening of differentially expressed genes upon TET2 knockdown identified genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication, and ribosome biology as major targets of TET2 in the initial step of adipogenic induction. The Ddx5 gene was identified and validated as the target. TET2-mediated epigenetic regulation of the Ddx5 gene was measured by two independent methods including immunoprecipitation against 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) as well as EpiMark 5hmC and 5mC analysis. Ddx5 expression was downregulated upon TET2 knockdown, coincided with a significant decrease of 5hmC at the Ddx5 locus. DDX5 knockdown significantly suppressed adipogenesis, while DDX5 overexpression promoted it. Importantly, DDX5 overexpression, when co-transfected, rescued the process of adipogenesis, which was hindered by TET2 siRNA treatment. The findings suggest TET2-mediated regulation of the Ddx5 gene is required for an initial step of adipogenesis.

Abstract: Branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) and linear chain/normal odd chain fatty acids (n-OCFA) are major fatty acids in human skin lipids, especially sebaceous gland (SG) wax esters. Skin lipids contain variable amounts of monounsaturated BCFA and n-OCFA, in some reports exceeding over 20% of total fatty acids. Fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) codes for a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes Δ4-, Δ6- and Δ8-desaturation towards ten unsaturated fatty acids but only one saturate, palmitic acid, converting it to 16:1n-10; FADS2 is not active towards 14:0 or 18:0. Here we test the hypothesis that FADS2 also operates on BCFA and n-OCFA. MCF-7 cancer cells stably expressing FADS1 or FADS2 along with empty vector control cells were incubated with anteiso-15:0, iso-16:0, iso-17:0, anteiso-17:0, iso-18:0, or n-17:0. BCFA were Δ6-desaturated by FADS2 as follows: iso-16:0 → iso-6Z-16:1, iso-17:0 → iso-6Z-17:1, anteiso-17:0 → anteiso-6Z-17:1 and iso-18:0 → iso-6Z-18:1. anteiso-15:0 was not desaturated in either FADS1 or FADS2 cells. n-17:0 was converted to both n-6Z-17:1 by FADS2 Δ6-desaturation and n-9Z-17:1 by SCD Δ9-desaturation. We thus establish novel FADS2-coded enzymatic activity towards BCFA and n-OCFA, expanding the number of known FADS2 saturated fatty acid substrates from one to six. Because of the importance of FADS2 in human skin, our results imply that dysfunction in activity of sebaceous FADS2 may play a role in skin abnormalities associated with skin lipids.

Abstract: Carboxyl ester lipase (Cel), is a lipolytic enzyme secreted by the pancreas, which hydrolyzes various species of lipids in the gut. Cel is also secreted by mammary gland during lactation and exists in breast milk. It facilitates dietary fat digestion and absorption, thus contributing to normal infant development. This study aimed to examine whether the Cel in zebrafish embryos has a similar role of maternal lipid utilization as in human infants, and how Cel contributes to the utilization of yolk lipids in zebrafish. The cel1 and cel2 genes were expressed ubiquitously in the blastodisc and yolk syncytial layer before 24 hpf, and in the exocrine pancreas after 72 hpf. The cel1 and cel2 morphants exhibited developmental retardation and yolk sac retention. The total cholesterol, cholesterol ester, free cholesterol, and triglyceride were reduced in the morphants' body while accumulated in the yolk (except triglyceride). The FFA content of whole embryos was much lower in morphants than in standard controls. Moreover, the delayed development in cel (cel1/cel2) double morphants was partially rescued by FFA and cholesterol supplementation. Delayed and weakened cholesterol ester transport to the brain and eyes was observed in cel morphants. Correspondingly, shrunken midbrain tectum, microphthalmia, pigmentation-delayed eyes as well as down-regulated Shh target genes were observed in the CNS of double morphants. Interestingly, cholesterol injections reversed these CNS alterations. Our findings suggested that cel genes participate in the lipid releasing from yolk sac to developing body, thereby contributing to the normal growth rate and CNS development in zebrafish.

Abstract: Objective
Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), a secreted protein, mainly regulates angiogenesis. Ang-1 has been shown to promote the development of atherosclerosis, whereas little is known about its effects on lipid metabolism and inflammation in this process.
Method
Ang-1 was transfected into ApoE−/− mice via lentiviral vector or incubated with THP-1 derived macrophages. Oil red O and HE staining were performed to measure the size of atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE−/− mice. Immunofluorescence was employed to show the expression of target proteins in aorta. [3H] labeled cholesterol was performed to examine the efficiency of cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) both in vivo and vitro. Western blot and qPCR were used to quantify target proteins both in vivo and vitro. ELISA detected the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse peritoneal macrophage.
Results
Our data showed that Ang-1 augmented atherosclerotic plaques formation and inhibited cholesterol efflux. The binding of Ang-1 to Tie2 resulted in downregulation of LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression via inhibiting the translocation of TFE3 into nucleus. In addition, Ang-1 decreased serum HDL-C levels and reduced reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in ApoE−/− mice. Furthermore, Ang-1 induced lipid accumulation followed by increasing TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β，and MCP-1 produced by MPMs, as well as inducing M1 phenotype macrophage marker iNOS and CD86 expression in aorta of ApoE−/− mice.
Conclusion
Ang-1 has an adverse effect on cholesterol efflux by decreasing the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 via Tie2/TFE3/LXRα pathway, thereby promoting inflammation and accelerating atherosclerosis progression.

Abstract: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). A diverse group of factors including miRNA has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these two metabolic conditions, although underlying molecular mechanisms involved are not well defined. Here, we provide evidence that hepatic miR-125a levels are diminished in both genetic as well as dietary mouse models of obesity. Overexpression of miR-125a enhanced insulin signaling and attenuated cellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and Hepa1–6 cells. Likewise, treatment of mice with ago-miR-125a increased insulin sensitivity, similar to overexpression of miR-125a, whereas treatment of mice with antago-miR-125a blunted the insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-125a in mice previously fed a high-fat diet (HFD), significantly improved insulin sensitivity, and attenuated obesity-linked hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte lipid accumulation. In addition, we show that ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6 (Elovl6) is a direct target of miR-125a, and participates in miR-125a mediated regulation of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. These data led us to conclude that dysregulated miR-125a expression augments the development of obesity-induced IR and that miR-125a might serve as a therapeutic target for the development of new drug(s) in the clinical management of metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Dysregulation of the tryptophan (Trp)-NAD+ pathway has been related to several pathological conditions, and the metabolites in this pathway are known to influence mitochondrial respiration and redox status. The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD+ pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD+ pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a negative impact on muscle mass, and reduces patient's mobility and autonomy. Furthermore, RA is associated with metabolic comorbidities, notably in lipid homeostasis by unknown mechanisms. To understand the links between the loss in muscle mass and the metabolic abnormalities, arthritis was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 11) using the collagen-induced arthritis model. Rats immunized with bovine type II collagen were compared to a control group of animals (n = 11) injected with acetic acid and complete Freund's adjuvant. The clinical severity of the ensuing arthritis was evaluated weekly by a semi-quantitative score. Skeletal muscles from the hind limb were used for the histological analysis and exploration of mitochondrial activity, lipid accumulation, metabolism and regenerative capacities. A significant atrophy in tibialis anterior muscle fibers was observed in the arthritic rats despite a non-significant decrease in the weight of the muscles. Despite moderate inflammation, accumulation of triglycerides (P < 0.05), reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number (P < 0.05) and non-significant dysfunction in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity were found in the gastrocnemius muscle. Concomitantly, our results suggested an activation of the muscle specific E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and MAFbx. Finally, the adipose tissue from the arthritic rats exhibited decreased PPARγ mRNA suggesting reduced adipogenic capacities. In conclusion, the reduced adipose tissue adipogenic capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity are probably involved in the activation of protein catabolism, inhibition of myogenesis, accumulation of lipids and fiber atrophy in the skeletal muscle during RA.

Abstract: Obesity, liver steatosis and type 2 diabetes are major diseases partly imputed to energy-dense diets rich in long chain triglycerides (LCT). The search for bioactive nutrients that help to overcome metabolic diseases is a growing field. In this regard, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) were shown to promote lipid catabolism and to stimulate brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. The objective of our study was to evaluate if the replacement of LCT by MCT in high-fat diets could prevent and/or reduce metabolic disorders. For this purpose, two cohorts of C57BL/6 mice were fed during 10 weeks with three isocaloric high-fat diets with variable MCT content. Cohort A was composed of lean mice while cohort B was composed of obese, insulin resistant mice. In cohort A, replacement of LCT by MCT preserved metabolic health, in part by triggering hepatic thermogenesis. We further found that medium chain fatty acids promote thermogenesis markers within cultured hepatocytes in a FFAR1/GPR40-dependent manner. In cohort B, high-fat diets enriched in MCT promoted body fat depletion and caused metabolic health improvement, together with the induction of thermogenesis markers in the liver as well as in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Our study supports that replacement of LCT by MCT in high-fat diets improves the metabolic features associated with obesity.

Abstract: SR-B1 belongs to the class B scavenger receptor, or CD36 super family. SR-B1 and CD36 share an affinity for a wide array of ligands. Although they exhibit similar ligand binding specificity, SR-B1 and CD36 have some very specific lipid transport functions. Whereas SR-B1 primarily facilitates the selective delivery of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and cholesterol from HDL particles to the liver and non-placental steroidogenic tissues, as well as participating in cholesterol efflux from cells, CD36 primarily mediates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids in high fatty acid-requiring organs such as the heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, CD36 also mediates cholesterol efflux and facilitates selective lipoprotein-CE delivery, although less efficiently than SR-B1. Interestingly, the ability or efficiency of SR-B1 to mediate fatty acid uptake has not been reported. In this paper, using overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SR-B1, we show that SR-B1 possesses the ability to facilitate fatty acid uptake. Moreover, this function is not blocked by BLT-1, a specific chemical inhibitor of HDL-CE uptake activity of SR-B1, nor by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, which inhibits fatty acid uptake by CD36. Attenuated fatty acid uptake was also observed in primary adipocytes isolated from SR-B1 knockout mice. In conclusion, facilitation of fatty acid uptake is an additional function that is mediated by SR-B1.

Abstract: Hepatic steatosis is the hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance with potential evolution towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Key roles of autophagy and oxidative stress in hepatic lipid accumulation and NAFLD progression are recognized. Here, we employed a rat hepatoma cell model of NAFLD progression made of FaO cells exposed to oleate/palmitate followed or not by TNFα treatment to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which silybin, a lipid-lowering nutraceutical, may improve hepatic lipid dyshomeostasis. The beneficial effect of silybin was found to involve amelioration of the fatty acids profile of lipid droplets, stimulation of the mitochondrial oxidation and upregulation of a microRNA of pivotal relevance in hepatic fat metabolism, miR-122. Silybin was also found to restore the levels of Aquaporin-9 (AQP9) and glycerol permeability while reducing the activation of the oxidative stress-dependent transcription factor NF-κB, and autophagy turnover. In conclusion, silybin was shown to have molecular effects on signaling pathways that were previously unknown and potentially protect the hepatocyte. These actions intersect TG metabolism, fat-induced autophagy and AQP9-mediated glycerol transport in hepatocytes.

Abstract: Mitochondrial membrane biogenesis requires the import of phospholipids; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Recent work has implicated membrane contact sites between the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and vacuole in phospholipid transport. Utilizing a genetic approach focused on these membrane contact site proteins, we have discovered a ‘moonlighting’ role of the membrane contact site and vesicular fusion protein, Vps39, in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) transport to the mitochondria. We show that the deletion of Vps39 prevents ethanolamine-stimulated elevation of mitochondrial PE levels without affecting PE biosynthesis in the ER or its transport to other sub-cellular organelles. The loss of Vps39 did not alter the levels of other mitochondrial phospholipids that are biosynthesized ex situ, implying a PE-specific role of Vps39. The abundance of Vps39 and its recruitment to the mitochondria and the ER is dependent on PE levels in each of these organelles, directly implicating Vps39 in the PE transport process. Deletion of essential subunits of Vps39-containing complexes, vCLAMP and HOPS, did not abrogate ethanolamine-stimulated PE elevation in the mitochondria, suggesting an independent role of Vps39 in intracellular PE trafficking. Our work thus identifies Vps39 as a novel player in ethanolamine-stimulated PE transport to the mitochondria.

Abstract: Trihydroxyoctadecenoic acids (TriHOMEs) are linoleic acid-derived lipid mediators reported to be dysregulated in obstructive lung disease. In contrast to many other oxylipins, TriHOME biosynthesis in humans is still poorly understood. The association of TriHOMEs with inflammation prompted the current investigation into the ability of human granulocytes to synthesize the 16 different 9,10,13-TriHOME and 9,12,13-TriHOME isomers and of the TriHOME biosynthetic pathway. Following incubation with linoleic acid, eosinophils and (to a lesser extent) the mast cell line LAD2, but not neutrophils, formed TriHOMEs. Stereochemical analysis revealed that TriHOMEs produced by eosinophils predominantly evidenced the 13(S) configuration, suggesting 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX)-mediated synthesis. TriHOME formation was blocked following incubation with the 15-LOX inhibitor BLX-3887 and was shown to be largely independent of soluble epoxide hydrolase and cytochrome P450 activities. TriHOME synthesis was abolished when linoleic acid was replaced with 13-HODE, but increased in incubations with 13-HpODE, indicating the intermediary role of epoxy alcohols in TriHOME formation. In contrast to eosinophils, LAD2 cells formed TriHOMEs having predominantly the 13(R) configuration, demonstrating that there are multiple synthetic routes for TriHOME formation. These findings provide for the first-time insight into the synthetic route of TriHOMEs in humans and expand our understanding of their formation in inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are organelles that have multiple roles in inflammatory and infectious diseases. LD act as essential platforms for immunometabolic regulation, including as sites for lipid storage and metabolism, inflammatory lipid mediator production, and signaling pathway compartmentalization. Accumulating evidence indicates that intracellular pathogens may exploit host LDs as source of nutrients and as part of their strategy to promote immune evasion. Notably, numerous studies have demonstrated the interaction between LDs and pathogen-containing phagosomes. However, the mechanism involved in this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we observed LDs and PLIN2 surrounding M. bovis BCG-containing phagosomes, which included observations of a bacillus cell surrounded by lipid content inside a phagosome and LAM from mycobacteria co-localizing with LDs; these results were suggestive of exchange of contents between these compartments. By using beads coated with M.tb lipids, we demonstrated that LD-phagosome associations are regulated through the mycobacterial cell wall components LAM and PIM. In addition, we demonstrated that Rab7 and RILP, but not Rab5, localizes to LDs of infected macrophages and observed the presence of Rab7 at the site of interaction with an infected phagosome. Moreover, treatment of macrophages with the Rab7 inhibitor CID1067700 significantly inhibited the association between LDs and LAM-coated beads. Altogether, our data demonstrate that LD-phagosome interactions are controlled by mycobacterial cell wall components and Rab7, which enables the exchange of contents between LDs and phagosomes and may represent a fundamental aspect of bacterial pathogenesis and immune evasion.

Abstract: Ceramide kinase (CerK) phosphorylates ceramide to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), a bioactive sphingolipid. Since the mechanisms responsible for regulating the proliferation and migration/metastasis of cancer cells by the CerK/C1P pathway remain unclear, we conducted the present study. The knockdown of CerK in A549 lung and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (shCerK cells) increased the formation of lamellipodia, which are membrane protrusions coupled with cell migration. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts prepared from CerK-null mice also showed an enhanced formation of lamellipodia. The overexpression of CerK inhibited lamellipodium formation in A549 cells. The knockdown of CerK increased the number of cells having lamellipodia with Rac1 and the levels of active Rac1-GTP form, whereas the overexpression of CerK decreased them. CerK was located in lamellipodia after the epidermal growth factor treatment, indicating that CerK functioned there to inhibit Rac1. The migration of A549 cells was negatively regulated by CerK. An intravenous injection of A549-shCerK cells into nude mice resulted in markedly stronger metastatic responses in the lungs than an injection of control cells. The in vitro growth of A549 cells and in vivo expansion after the injection into mouse flanks were not affected by the CerK knockdown. These results suggest that the activation of CerK/C1P pathway has inhibitory roles on lamellipodium formation, migration, and metastasis of A549 lung cancer cells.

Abstract: In contrast to human hepatocytes in vivo, which solely express acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) 2, both ACAT1 and ACAT2 (encoded by SOAT1 and SOAT2) are expressed in primary human hepatocytes and in human hepatoma cell lines. Here, we aimed to create hepatocyte-like cells expressing the ACAT2, but not the ACAT1, protein to generate a model that – at least in this regard – resembles the human condition in vivo and to assess the effects on lipid metabolism. Using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology, we knocked out SOAT1 in HepG2 and Huh7.5 cells. The wild type and SOAT2-only-cells were cultured with fetal bovine or human serum and the effects on lipoprotein and lipid metabolism were studied. In SOAT2-only-HepG2 cells, increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein(a) in the cell media were detected; this was likely dependent of the increased expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism (e.g. MTP, APOB, HMGCR, LDLR, ACACA, and DGAT2). Opposite effects were observed in SOAT2-only-Huh7.5 cells. Our study shows that the expression of SOAT1 in hepatocyte-like cells contributes to the distorted phenotype observed in HepG2 and Huh7.5 cells. As not only parameters of lipoprotein and lipid metabolism but also some markers of differentiation/maturation increase in the SOAT2-only-HepG2 cells cultured with HS, this cellular model represent an improved model for studies of lipid metabolism.

Abstract: During cold acclimation fruit flies switch their feeding from yeast to plant food, however there are no robust molecular markers to monitor this in the wild. Drosophila melanogaster is a sterol auxotroph and relies on dietary sterols to produce lipid membranes, lipoproteins and molting hormones. We employed shotgun lipidomics to quantify eight major food sterols in total lipid extracts of heads and genital tracts of adult male and female flies. We found that their sterol composition is dynamic and reflective of fly diet in an organ-specific manner. Season-dependent changes observed in the organs of wild-living flies suggested that the molar ratio between yeast (ergosterol, zymosterol) and plant (sitosterol, stigmasterol) sterols is a quantifiable, generic and unequivocal marker of their feeding behavior suitable for ecological and environmental population-based studies. The enrichment of phytosterols over yeast sterols in wild-living flies at low temperatures is consistent with switching from yeast to plant diet and corroborates the concomitantly increased unsaturation of their membrane lipids.

Abstract: Since inhibitors of sphingosine kinases (SK1, SK2) have been shown to induce p53-mediated cell death, we have further investigated their role in regulating p53, stress activated protein kinases and XBP-1s in HEK293T cells. Treatment of these cells with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor, SKi, which fails to induce apoptosis, promoted the conversion of p53 into two proteins with molecular masses of 63 and 90 kDa, and which was enhanced by over-expression of ubiquitin. The SKi induced conversion of p53 to p63/p90 was also enhanced by siRNA knockdown of SK1, but not SK2 or dihydroceramide desaturase (Degs1), suggesting that SK1 is a negative regulator of this process. In contrast, another sphingosine kinase inhibitor, ABC294640 only very weakly stimulated formation of p63/p90 and induced apoptosis of HEK293T cells. We have previously shown that SKi promotes the polyubiquitination of Degs1, and these forms positively regulate p38 MAPK/JNK pathways to promote HEK293T cell survival/growth. siRNA knockdown of SK1 enhanced the activation of p38 MAPK/JNK pathways in response to SKi, suggesting that SK1 functions to oppose these pro-survival pathways in HEK293T cells. SKi also enhanced the stimulatory effect of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 on the expression of the pro-survival protein XBP-1s and this was reduced by siRNA knockdown of SK2 and increased by knockdown of p53. These findings suggest that SK1 and SK2 have opposing roles in regulating p53-dependent function in HEK293T cells.

Abstract: Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is recognized by CD14 protein and the Toll-like receptor (TLR)4/MD2 complex localized in the plasma membrane of immune cells. TLR4 triggers two signaling pathways engaging the MyD88 and TRIF adaptor proteins which lead to production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. These processes are likely to be modulated by sphingomyelin, as the CD14 - TLR4 interaction takes place in plasma membrane rafts enriched in this lipid. To verify this assumption, we analyzed the influence of tricyclodecane-9-yl xanthogenate (D609), which was proven here to be an SMS inhibitor, and silencing of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) 1 and/or SMS2 on LPS-induced signaling in macrophages. LPS up-regulated the expression and activity of SMS while exposure to D609 or silencing of SMS1 and SMS2 counteracted this action and led (except for SMS2 silencing) to a depletion of sphingomyelin in cells. Concomitantly, the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways of TLR4 were inhibited with the latter being especially sensitive to the reduction of the SMS1 and/or SMS2 activity. The D609 treatment and SMS1 and/or SMS2 depletion all reduced the level of CD14 protein in cells, which likely was an important determinant of the reduction of the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses.

Abstract: Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are a new class of endogenous lipids with anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic effects, having the potential to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D). In view of the important regulatory and therapeutic actions of FAHFAs on age-related diseases such as T2D, we hypothesized that they may also play crucial roles in the growth, development, and aging process. Here, we investigated the FAHFA footprint in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of mice across lifespan to attain potential clues for understanding the roles of FAHFAs in growth, development, and aging using chemical isotope labeling assisted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. VAT samples were harvested from 80 C57BL/6J male mice of nine different ages (1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months). The results showed that a total of 51 FAHFA families, including 301 regioisomers, were detected in the VAT of mice of all ages, and the number of FAHFAs (both family and regioisomer) in VAT increased with age, from 35 families (186 ± 0 regioisomers) at 1-month-old mice to 46 families (278 ± 6 regioisomers) in 18-month-old mice. Furthermore, the content of 12 FAHFA families per 100 mg of VAT of mice was highly correlated with age, and was usually low in the middle-age (3–15 months). However, because the VAT mass was 4–5 fold higher in middle-aged mice compared to younger or older mice, the total amount of most of the FAHFA regioisomers in VAT was increased in middle-aged mice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the number of regioisomers from 51 FAHFA families and abundance of 15 FAHFA families are strongly dependent on age, which would be helpful for understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of FAHFAs on growth, development, and aging.

Contrasting effects of membrane enrichment with polyunsaturated fatty acids on phospholipid composition and cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded J774 mouse or primary human macrophages,

Abstract: A high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly n-3 PUFAs, is atheroprotective. PUFAs incorporation into membrane phospholipids alters the functionality of membrane proteins. We studied the consequences of the in vitro supplementation of several PUFAs on the FA profiles and on ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux capacities from cholesterol-loaded macrophages. Arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4 n-6) and, to a lesser extent, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3), dose-dependently impaired cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded J774 mouse macrophages without alterations in ABCA1 expression, whereas docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) had no impact. AA cells exhibited higher proportions of arachidonic acid and adrenic acid (C22:4 n-6), its elongation product. EPA cells exhibited slightly higher proportions of EPA associated with much higher proportions of docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n-3), its elongation product and with lower proportions of AA. Conversely, both EPA and DHA and, to a lesser extent, AA decreased cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded primary human macrophages (HMDM). The differences observed in FA profiles after PUFA supplementations were different from those observed for the J774 cells. In conclusion, we are the first to report that AA and EPA, but not DHA, have deleterious effects on the cardioprotective ABCA1 cholesterol efflux pathway from J774 foam cells. Moreover, the membrane incorporation of PUFAs does not have the same impact on cholesterol efflux from murine (J774) or human (HMDM) cholesterol-loaded macrophages. This finding emphasizes the key role of the cellular model in cholesterol efflux studies and may partly explain the heterogeneous literature data on the impact of PUFAs on cholesterol efflux.

Abstract: Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in ANGPTL3, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), cause a drastic reduction of serum lipoproteins and protect against the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Therefore, ANGPTL3 is a promising therapy target. We characterized the impacts of ANGPTL3 depletion on the immortalized human hepatocyte (IHH) transcriptome, lipidome and human plasma lipoprotein lipidome. The transcriptome of ANGPTL3 knock-down (KD) cells showed altered expression of several pathways related to lipid metabolism. Accordingly, ANGPTL3 depleted IHH displayed changes in cellular overall fatty acid (FA) composition and in the lipid species composition of several lipid classes, characterized by abundant n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs). This PUFA increase coincided with an elevation of lipid mediators, among which there were species relevant for resolution of inflammation, protection from lipotoxic and hypoxia-induced ER stress, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance or for the recovery from cardiovascular events. Cholesterol esters were markedly reduced in ANGPTL3 KD IHH, coinciding with suppression of the SOAT1 mRNA and protein. ANGPTL3 LOF caused alterations in plasma lipoprotein FA and lipid species composition. All lipoprotein fractions of the ANGPTL3 LOF subjects displayed a marked drop of 18:2n-6, while several highly unsaturated triacylglycerol (TAG) species were enriched. The present work reveals distinct impacts of ANGPTL3 depletion on the hepatocellular lipidome, transcriptome and lipid mediators, as well as on the lipidome of lipoproteins isolated from plasma of ANGPTL3-deficient human subjects. It is important to consider these lipidomics and transcriptomics findings when targeting ANGPTL3 for therapy and translating it to the human context.
