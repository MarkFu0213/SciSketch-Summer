Abstract: In this work, highly stable and efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in n-i-p configuration has been fabricated. Application of poly (4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) interlayer into the perovskite films via solution based process and quaternary semiconductor Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+) (CMTS) nanostructure particles as an inorganic hole transporting material (HTM), result in modified perovskite surface and improving the long term stability and the photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the record device with Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) HTM and PVP interlayer reaches 13.57%, Voc gains 1.03 V, fill factor (FF) increases up to 70.64% and the device demonstrates low hysteresis (4.14%). Photoluminescence (PL), absorption spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and FESEM images reveal that, the interface between PVP and inorganic CMTS nanostructure particles favorably can reduce non-radiative recombination and enhance Voc. In addition, the presence of hydrophobic PVP interlayer and CMTS nanostructure particles capping with PVP ligands prevent the ingress of the moisture in to the perovskite layer and result in improved stability, where the devices based on CZTS HTM, retain 97% of the initial efficiency after 30 days at room temperature and 35–40% relative humidity.

Abstract: Potential-induced degradation (PID)-test results of modules fabricated from the rear- and front-emitter silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells were compared to clarify the influence of the emitter position of SHJ photovoltaic (PV) cell modules on their PID behaviors. The PID tests were performed by applying a bias of −2000 V to the shorted interconnector ribbons from the front surface of the cover glass, at 85 °C. In the initial stage, both modules showed the same degradation characterized by a reduction in the short-circuit current density (Jsc). After the first-stage degradation, the rear-emitter SHJ PV modules exhibited subsequent degradation characterized by a significant reduction in the Jsc and open-circuit voltage (Voc), due to the enhancement of the minority-carrier recombination in the front surface region of the n-type crystalline silicon base. The front-emitter SHJ PV modules, on the other hand, showed a reduction in the fill factor (FF), in addition to moderate reductions in Jsc and Voc. The FF reduction of the front-emitter SHJ PV modules is considered to be caused by the enhancement of the recombination in the front surface region of the n-type crystalline-silicon base as the region corresponds to the pn junction interface of the front-emitter configuration. The moderate reductions in both Jsc and Voc may be due to further progression of the first-stage degradation. These findings are essential for understanding the mechanism of PID in SHJ PV cell modules.

Abstract: As a well-known thermochromic material, Vanadium dioxide (VO2) has drawn widespread interest due to its particular phase transition feature. Many endeavors have been implemented to decrease critical temperature in order to realize VO2-based smart window, while there is still much room to improve. Herein, we provide a facile way to control the critical temperature of VO2 by co-introducing of hydrogen and oxygen vacancy while without deteriorating its original metal-insulator transition behavior. SIMS was carried out to detect the depth profile of hydrogen element, and XPS was conducted to investigate the chemical state. Based on the first-principle calculation, it was found that the hydrogen played a crucial role on the structural evolution of VO2. For seldom hydrogen doping, rutile-like VO2 with metallic state was formed, in agreement with the XRD observation. Strikingly, it transformed into a more monoclinic structure as further introducing hydrogen atoms. In addition, the energy-eﬃcient demonstration experiment exhibited a promising application for VO2 material in energy-saving field. The current findings offer a novel strategy to modulate the critical temperature of VO2, which will promote the development of VO2 in smart window and bring insight into comprehensive understanding the role of H in VO2 phase transition process.

Abstract: Salt hydrate based thermochemical heat storage (TCHS) is currently a pivotal technique used for long-term energy storage due to its reversible gas-solid reaction at middle-to-low temperature. MgSO4 is a promising salt candidate owing to its theoretically ultrahigh energy storage density (ESD). However, its poor heat and mass transfer performance severely restricts its large-scale application. Composite salts consist of MgSO4 and other promising salt are prepared to improve the thermochemical performance such as the adsorption kinetics. Simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) is used to screen several other potential salt candidates by comparing the ESD. SrCl2 shows the highest ESD and is selected to mix with MgSO4. X-ray diffraction confirms that the composite salt hydrate is successfully prepared, and the chemical composition is measured by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The STA results show that the mixture with an appropriate composition proportion can enhance ESD at mid-low temperatures. The mixture with 20 wt% MgSO4 possesses the best adsorption kinetics even under the most unfavorable condition. Vapor adsorption isobars for dehydrated SrCl2, MgSO4, and their mixtures are measured between 30 °C and 90 °C, which is conducive to understand the chemisorption mechanism. Additionally, cyclability test results show that the aforementioned mixture has better cycle stability than do pure salts. Specifically, the heat storage capacity of the mixture stays above 75% of the original after 20 consecutive heat charging (dehydration) and discharging (hydration) cycles. All these results indicate that the composite salt has good potential for use in long-term TCHS at mid-low temperatures.

Abstract: Up to now, the most efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) typically utilize Spiro-OMeTAD as hole transporting materials (HTMs). The unique “spiro” structure offers appropriate energy levels for hole transfer and high thermal stability with suppressed aggregation. However, the pristine Spiro-OMeTAD requires additional oxidizing dopants to work efficiently due to its low hole mobility. To retain the advantages of spiral structure and overcome its shortcomings, we demonstrate the design of three dopant-free HTMs with spiral structure by molecular engineering, in which three groups with different conjugated lengths, namely benzene, naphthalene and anthracene, are inserted between spiral core and electron donor. These designed molecules, Y-1~Y-3, are initially identified with quantum chemical calculations based on the mother molecule X59 and then are obtained by easy synthetic routes. Our studies show that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states are formed in the designed molecules due to the introduction of conjugated groups, which produces a self-doping effect without the need to add any external dopant. The best-performing PSCs using the dopant-free Y-1 as HTM achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.29% under one sun illumination, which is higher than that of devices with X59 as dopant-free HTMs (14.64%). The present work provides an effective strategy for designing, synthesizing of highly efficient and stable dopant-free HTMs.

Abstract: Monofacial PERC and bifacial PERC + solar cells have become the mainstream solar cell technology exhibiting conversion efficiencies around 22.5% in mass production. We determine a specific saturation current density J0,Ag = 1400 fA/cm2 of the screen-printed Ag front contact. When weighted with the contact area fraction of 3.0% the Ag metal contacts contribute 42 fA/cm2 to the total J0,total = 130 fA/cm2 thereby being a main limitation of the Voc. We investigate carrier selective poly-Si on oxide (POLO) fingers below the screen-printed Ag contacts of PERC + solar cells in order to minimize contact recombination. We name this solar cell PERC + POLO. Numerical simulations reveal that PERC + POLO cells exhibit an efficiency potential up to 24.1% which is 0.3%abs. higher compared to PERC + solar cells. In order to enable low-cost manufacturing of poly-Si fingers, we investigate for the first time the deposition of suitable a-Si fingers by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) through a shadow mask in a vacuum chamber. We demonstrate a-Si fingers as narrow as 70 μm and as high as 250 nm. The parasitic deposition below the mask increases the a-Si finger width by less than 30 μm compared to the mask opening width. First test wafers demonstrate an implied Voc up to 716 mV of PECVD a-Si layers which are crystalized and doped in a subsequent POCl3 diffusion. Applying this process sequence, PERC + POLO cells could be manufactured with the established industrial PERC + process only adding the PECVD deposition of a-Si fingers through a shadow mask.

Abstract: Here, we report a method using laser beam induced current (LBIC) measurements to ascertain nonresponsive features of photovoltaic devices that are smaller than the measurement beam size. To demonstrate the method, we determine the effective electrical width of laser scribed lines. Laser scribing is a critical process in producing thin-film photovoltaics modules and minimizing the effective width of the laser scribed lines is important for closing the cell-to-module efficiency gap. However, in addition to removing material, laser scribing can also produce a heat-affected zone in which the optoelectronic properties of the remaining materials may be adversely impacted. We measured the LBIC signal across scribe lines that were produced in CdTe thin-films. The collected data was compared with the expectations based on the probing beam's shape and the profile of the scribed line. The approach allows the electrical dead width to be determined with a resolution that is substantially higher than the width of the LBIC beam. At the lowest scribing powers, where the lines were the smallest, the electrically-determined widths were larger than the optically-determined widths by nearly a factor of two. The ability to rapidly resolve features that are much smaller than the dimensions of the probing laser beam without the use of confocal optics may be useful in a manufacturing environment, as demonstrated here, or more generally for rapid defect identification on devices with areas ranging from centimeters up to meters.

Abstract: Dynamic radiative cooling with variable emissive power is experimentally demonstrated in this study by a wavelength-selective tunable metafilm emitter, which consists of an opaque aluminum film, a sputtered silicon spacer, and a thermochromic vanadium dioxide (VO2) layer fabricated by a furnace oxidation method. The temperature-dependent spectral emittance, experimentally obtained from spectral reflectance measurements, clearly shows a pronounced emission peak around 10 μm wavelength when the VO2 experiences an insulator-to-metal phase transition near 65 °C. The tunable metafilm emitter achieves a significant total emittance increase from 0.14 at room temperature to 0.60 at 100 °C. Theoretical modeling based on thin-film optics indicates that the emission enhancement at high temperatures is realized by Fabry-Perot cavity resonance with the metallic VO2 film. Moreover, a calorimetry-based thermal vacuum experiment was conducted and the enhanced thermal emission of the fabricated tunable metafilm sample was experimentally demonstrated at temperatures higher than the phase transition temperature, compared to black, aluminum and doped silicon samples, whose emittance changes little near room temperatures. The developed tunable metafilm emitter with variable spectrally-selective emittance in the mid-infrared holds great promise for both terrestrial and extraterrestrial dynamic radiative cooling applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel shape-stable phase change material (PCM) composite for thermal energy storage applications. The formulation of the material consists of the components: eutectic nitrate (NaNO3-KNO3) as thermal storage material, expanded graphite (EG) for improving structural stability and thermal conductivity, and SiO2 nanoparticles for improving specific heat. The material was successfully prepared by the mechanical dispersion method. The effects of EG and SiO2 nanoparticles additives on the thermophysical properties of the composite were investigated by SEM, STA, and LFA. The results showed that EG, SiO2 nanoparticles and eutectic nitrate have excellent chemical compatibility. The specific heat of the composite was 3.92 J/(g·K), which was 2.58 times higher than that of eutectic nitrate when the content of EG and SiO2 nanoparticles was 15 wt% and 1 wt%, respectively. The latent heat of the composite decreased with the increase of EG mass fraction, but overall an increase in energy storage density was found due to the addition of SiO2 nanoparticles. The thermal conductivity of the composite with 15 wt% EG and 1 wt% SiO2 nanoparticles was significantly increased by about 16.2 times compared with that of eutectic nitrate. Furthermore, thermal cycle stability was tested. The NaNO3-KNO3/1 wt% nano-SiO2/15 wt% EG composite showed no obvious specific heat change after 100 thermal cycles and 100 h high-temperature test, respectively. The prepared NaNO3-KNO3/nano-SiO2/EG composite has a promising application prospect in the high-temperature energy storage.

Abstract: The implementation of inexpensive scalable thermal energy storage will play a crucial role in the successful establishment of dispatchable renewable energy technologies. Storage based on molten nitrate salts is one of the most relevant technologies implemented in the GWh-scale. Yet, there is significant cost reduction potential in replacing the conventional two-tank system by a single-tank thermocline system. The latter involves the use of a single-tank design where a large fraction of the costly salt is replaced by an inexpensive filler material. Industrial waste materials such as AlferRock (red-mud-derived Fe2O3-rich ceramics), have significant potential since they are readily available in the Mt-range and have adequate thermal and mechanical resistance at the intended temperature of use. This study explicitly investigates the corrosion resistance of AlferRock in Solar Salt, 60% NaNO3-40% KNO3 mixture, at 560 °C. By variation of particle sizes classical exposure tests as well as accelerated test methods can be applied to understand the long-term stability of this waste material under relevant conditions. Salt chemistry and compositional changes in the filler are analyzed in terms of ion chromatography, titration, diffraction techniques (XRD) as well as electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with element mapping (EDX).

Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the impact of interstitial Fe contamination on the effective minority carrier lifetime of n-type Cz silicon bulk material for high efficiency solar cells. The study covers a Fe concentration in the silicon bulk from 3.5 × 1012 cm-3 to 2.7 × 1014cm-3. We have added 5 different concentrations (30, 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 ppb) of Fe intentionally to a wet chemical process tank and measured the transfer to the silicon wafer surface mimicking a possible contamination during wet chemical processing. In order to fabricate carrier lifetime test vehicles, the silicon wafer is then passivated with thermal silicon oxide from both sides. The surface contamination is driven into the bulk by mimicking a high temperature process during solar cell manufacturing. Effective minority carrier lifetime is measured at injection levels from 1 × 1013 cm-3 to 3 × 1015cm-3. We have fitted the theoretical curve for interstitial Fe derived from the SRH theory to the measured values and extracted the Fe contamination concentration. This value is comparable to the calculated value extracted from the surface contamination measurement. For low level injection (LLI), we extracted the capture cross section for interstitial Fe to be 6.45 × 10-17 cm/s ± 2.23 × 10-17 cm/s. The measured Fe contamination levels are used for the conversion efficiency fitting of a n-type bifacial silicon solar cell using QUOKKA simulations. The simulations show that very low Fe contamination concentrations of [Fe]bulk = 3.5 × 1012 cm-3 ([Fe]surf = 6 × 1010cm-2) already degrade the solar cell efficiency by 10% relative.

Abstract: Sensible heat storage is a cost-efficient and scalable technology for energy storage. The state-of-the-art storage systems in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants use the storage material Solar Salt, which is a nitrate salt mixture. Chemical stability of this salt material is crucial for lifetime reliance, and for development of the storage technology towards higher temperatures. High temperatures enhance the storage capacity, but also promote decomposition reactions. For instance, harmful gases can evolve, and oxide ions are produced, which aggravate corrosion. Up to now, it is unclear how to describe the salt chemistry, and how to quantitatively predict the problematic decomposition products. The experimental method in this study is chosen with regard to the exclusion of mass transport limitations. Thin films of salt are heated to 560–630 °C. The salt composition is analyzed by ion chromatography and acid-base titration. The ratio of nitrite to nitrate ions stabilizes, which indicates chemical equilibrium of the nitrite forming reaction. The oxide content increases continuously over time, and is interpreted in terms of a kinetic rate law. A consistent mathematical description of Solar Salt chemistry at high temperatures (≥560 °C) in contact with air is presented. It includes thermodynamic parameters, in particular the reaction enthalpy of 95 ± 4 kJ⋅mol−1 and entropy of 86 ± 5 J⋅mol−1⋅K−1 for the nitrate-nitrite reaction. The microkinetics of the oxide ion formation are characterized by an activation energy of 42 ± 3 kJ⋅mol−1. The work presented finally contributes to a forecast of material stability at and above 560 °C.

Abstract: At present, solar energy is widely used as a kind of clean energy. The main solar radiation range under AM 1.5 is about 300 ~ 3000 nm. In this paper, we designed an efficient, ultra-broadband perfect solar absorber to have as long absorption bands in this range as possible to help alleviate the energy problem. The simulation calculations and experiments of the solar absorber show that the absorption bandwidth with absorption greater than 90% is greater than 2100 nm. It is worth noting that the perfect absorption bandwidth with absorption greater than 99% has more than 1600 nm. The absorption rate over the whole wavelength range (300 nm–3000 nm) (weighted directly around the sun by solar AM 1.5) is more than 90%. We can effectively control the absorption spectrum by adjusting the structural parameters. In addition, the proposed solar absorber is polarization independent, both the transverse electrical (TE) mode and the transverse magnetic (TM) mode, Absorption remains above 80% when the wide incidence angle is as high as 50°. Our propose design has high broadband absorption and great potential for solar thermal energy harvesting, thermoelectrics, and thermal emitters applications.

Abstract: Curcumin has been demonstrated to affect the chemoresistance in cancer cells of various origins. However, its ability to modulate lactate-induced chemoresistance remains unclear. The Present investigation demonstrates that curcumin inhibits the survival of HepG2 and HuT78 cells and can modulate chemo-susceptibility of HepG2 cells. Experimental simulation of simultaneous and pre-treatment suggest cooperatively between curcumin and anticancer drugs as well as the modulation of molecular regulators. Inhibition of glucose consumption, lactate production, extracellular acidity and augmented level of Nitric oxide were observed. DAPI staining revealed hyper condensation of chromatin in curcumin-treated HepG2 cells. Curcumin also diminished the lactate-induced chemoresistance against doxorubicin in hepatic cancer cells along with down regulation of lactate receptor (hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor-1; HCAR-1/GPR81). Alteration of the extracellular milieu along with inhibited expression of genes (hif-1α, ldh-a, mct-1, mdr-1 and stat-3) and proteins (HIF-1α and HCAR-1) are indicated to be involved in curcumin-induced reversal of chemoresistance in HepG2 cells. Findings of present investigation contribute to knowledge of curcumin mediated chemosensitization and its mechanism.

Abstract: In recent times, solar-driven desalination has emerged as a sustainable solution for the impending water crisis. Herein, we report a novel solar-driven steam generator manufactured from porous carbon derived from sweet lime peels (a food waste) and polyvinyl alcohol sponge for efficient steam generation and its application in solar seawater desalination. The solar steam generator fabricated with a unidirectional pathway design satisfactorily absorbed incoming solar illumination, provided localized heat at the air-water interface and produced steam at a rate of 1.386 kg m−2 h−1, exhibiting an excellent photothermal efficiency of 90.88% under 1 sun (1000 W m−2) illumination. Furthermore, the steam generator proved capable of maintaining its performance in lower solar intensities (<1 sun), making it an excellent device for seawater desalination. Bearing in mind the aforementioned virtues, the steam generator was incorporated into a facile laboratory solar still for passive solar desalination. The modified solar still could generate clean water even at low simulated solar intensities with a near-100% salt removal efficiency. Moreover, the excellent performance of the solar still was retained in long-term and real-life experimentation and resulted in sustained clean water generation. The merits of the solar still, such as facile fabrication technique, low cost, scalability, and excellent desalination performance should inspire further research in solar steam generator-based solar stills for solar seawater desalination.

Abstract: Soiling impacts the photovoltaic (PV) module performance by reducing the amount of light reaching the photovoltaic cells and by changing their external spectral response. Currently, the soiling monitoring market is moving toward optical sensors that measure transmittance or reflectance, rather than directly measuring the impact of soiling on the performance of photovoltaic modules. These sensors, which use a single optical measurement, are not able to correct the soiling losses that depend on the solar irradiance spectra and on the spectral response of the monitored PV material. This work investigates methods that can improve the optical detection of soiling by extracting the full soiling spectrum profiles using only two or three monochromatic measurements. Spectral transmittance data, measured with a spectrophotometer and collected during a 46-week experimental soiling study carried out in Jaén, Spain, was analysed in this work. The use of a spectral profile for the hemispherical transmittance of soiled PV glass is found to significantly improve the soiling detection, returning the lowest errors independently of the PV materials and irradiance conditions. In addition, this work shows that it is also possible to select the measurement wavelengths to minimize the soiling loss detection error depending on the monitored PV semiconductor material (silicon, CdTe, a-Si, CIGS and a representative perovskite). The approaches discussed in this work are also found to be more robust to potential measurement errors compared to single wavelength measurement techniques.

Abstract: Electrochromic supercapacitor (SC) have great research significance on the exploration of smart energy storage device. Conjugated polymer (CP) as a promising electrode material for electrochromic SC, has advantages of low price, structural controllability, ease of processing, and excellent ﬂexibility. However, low mechanical stability and limit cycle life constraint the performance of conducting polymer in SC. Herein, we have designed and synthesized a carbazole based polymer PCBDTP with the side chain terminal linked with vinyl groups, which can simply be solution processed to form a thin film and subsequently undergo thermal cross-linking to provide a stable and cross-linked polymer (PCBDTP-X) network. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) fabricated with PCBDTP-X as the positive electrode material, exhibited outstanding electrochemical stability and electrochromic behavior, resulting in a "smart" energy storage device in which its energy storage level can be visualized through the color change. The PCBDTP-X//PEDOT electrochromic ASC with PMMA-based solid electrolyte yielded maximum energy density of 18.4 W h kg-1, across a wide potential window of 2.4 V. More importantly, the capacitance could still retain above 99.1% of the initial value after 5000 charging/discharging cycles, which indicated its outstanding cyclic stability. Meanwhile, the device exhibited high optical contrast at the wavelength of 480 nm with a noticeable and reversible color change from yellow-brown (discharged state) to gray-blue (charged state). In summary, we present here a new strategy to design the conjugated polymer with outstanding electrochemical stability and superior performance for electrochromic supercapacitor as next-generation smart energy storage device.

Abstract: Radiative cooling is a passive means of cooling that does not require the consumption of additional energy and has broad application potential. While experimental spectral measurements have been conducted, the daylighting of buildings, photovoltaic (PV) cells, and vehicles has seldom been considered. Here, we use spectrum-selective coatings to resolve the competing demands of daylighting (or appearance) and radiative cooling. A simple liquid blade-coating method that was inexpensive, convenient, and scalable was used to achieve radiative cooling with ultrahigh transmittance in visible light and excellent cooling performance. Resonant polar dielectric SiO2 microparticles with optimized volumetric fractions and diameters were randomly mixed into an acrylic resin and manually bladed at room temperature with natural evaporation drying. Spectrometry results showed that a mean visible light transmittance >91.3% was achieved, which was much higher than reported in previous studies; a mean emittance >93.7% within the “atmospheric window” was also reached. Over four days testing of a silver-plated aluminum sheet in a populous area at sea level, we achieved a maximum sub-ambient decrease in temperature of ~8.7 °C and a maximum cooling power of 108.49 W/m2.

Abstract: Harvesting full spectrum sunlight for direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs) has attracted extensive attention and a number of potential nanofluids have been reported. In the current work, oxygen-deficient TiO2 (TiO2-x) improves the defects of conventional TiO2, making it fascinating optical absorption in the full solar spectrum. In the current work, oxygen-deficient TiO2 is obtained by NaBH4-reduction. The lower the reduction temperature is, the poorer the full solar absorption possesses. 600 °C is an appropriate reducing temperature from the results of XRD and UV–Vis–NIR. TiO2-x is stably dispersed in two oil system (heat transfer oil and silicone oil), leading to good medium-temperature solar thermal conversion. Au nanoparticles can further enhance the full solar absorption of oxygen-deficient TiO2. The highest temperature can be arrived at 91 °C for 100 ppm 5% Au/TiO2-x, 26.6 °C higher than base silicone oil. The excellent full solar absorption properties of TiO2-x and Au/TiO2-x in oil nanofluids bring new paradigms for working fluids in DASCs with medium temperatures.

Abstract: Sub-ambient radiative cooling has been achieved recently by applying advanced nanofabrication technologies, which attracts extensive research attention due to its passive cooling characteristic. Water condensation is an important application of radiative cooling, which is also an unconventional technology for gaining fresh water without consuming energy. However, limited efforts have been devoted to improving the water harvesting using the state-of-the-art radiative cooling materials. To efficiently accomplish dew condensation by radiative cooling, we first take a theoretical approach to analyze the weather conditions for effective dew condensation. Then, we propose the durable enhance specular reflector-metal by 3 M Company (DESR-M) as an efficient material for dew condensation and further improve its dew condensation performance through a simple hydrophilic coating. The dew condensation performance shows significant enhancement over the previously used polytetrafluororoethylene (PTFE) radiative condenser. On-site experiment result shows that the hydrophilic DESR-M can achieve lowest cooling temperature among all the three samples. The dew yield improves by 72.7% and 88.1% compared to DESR-M and PTFE, respectively.

Abstract: The human archease, hereafter named HArch, is identified as a key cofactor of the tRNA-splicing ligase complex, and a potential therapeutic target for treating nervous system injuries. However, little is known about the structural basis of HArch in tRNA maturation, mRNA splicing, and RNA repair. Here we report the crystal structures of HArch and its two mutants D51A and D178A with resolutions ranging from 1.96 Å to 3.4 Å. HArch is composed of an extended N-terminal protrusion domain (NTD) and one compacted C-terminal domain (CTD). Unlike previously reported homologous proteins, the NTD of the first subunit interacts with the CTD of the second one, and this interaction might be important for maintaining protein stability. Moreover, HArch interacts and colocalizes with RNA ligase RTCB in cells. Our current study reveals the atomic structure of HArch and may help us understand its function in mRNA splicing.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Among patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, continuous intravenous (IV) tacrolimus infusion is frequently used for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. Twice-daily intermittent IV tacrolimus dosing may confer safety and convenience benefits.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of 66 patients who received twice-daily IV bolus tacrolimus for GvHD prophylaxis. The primary end point of the study was safety, as measured by renal toxicity. The secondary end points included mean tacrolimus serum concentrations, incidence of grades II–IV acute GvHD, electrolyte abnormalities, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and neurologic toxicity.
Results
There was acceptable, possibly favorable, incidence of renal toxicity (42%) and no significant difference in grades II–IV GvHD (37%), compared with published data. Mean tacrolimus blood concentrations were not affected by occurrence of renal toxicity.
Conclusion
We conclude that administration of IV tacrolimus twice daily over 4 h may be safe and effective in preventing GvHD in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.

Abstract: The production of fresh water by means of solar steam generation has emerged as one of frontier technologies for addressing the global water shortage issue. Here, we report the preparation of new photothermal materials by chemical modification of nickel foam with sulfur via a simple hydrothermal method for solar steam generation. The generation of nano nickel wire on the surface of skeleton of nickel foam by sulfur treatment could construct a much more dense network with hierarchical porous structure and hydrophilicity, which significantly enhance their light absorption (average 40–50% for untreated nickel foam while 91% for sulfur treated nickel foam (named as S–Ni foam) as well as water transportation. In the way, the as-prepared S–Ni foam possesses a high energy conversion efficiency of 83.6% under 1 kW m−2 irradiation. In view of most of reported photothermal materials which suffer the drawback of lose effectiveness in oily water, the S–Ni foam was further chemically modified with an anionic coordination between sodium perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium (PDDA) chloride to achieve a strong hydrophilic-oleophobic wettability (named as OR-S-Ni foam). Such unique wettability endows the as-resulted OR-S-Ni foam excellent oil-repellent performance, making it possible solar vaporization even in water containing oils or organics contaminates, which should be of significantly technological significance for practical solar steam generation by largely extends its applications range.

Abstract: Interfacial engineering is an effective method to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to find a material as interfacial layer with the dual function of defect-passivation and efficient charge-transfer. In this work, organophosphorus ligands, trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), were used as passivators through antisolvent process for the interfacial modification. Significantly, the organophosphorus ligands can effectively passivate the defects of perovskite crystals through the formation of Pb–O bond between organophosphorus ligand and undercoordinated Pb2+ ion in perovskite. More interestingly, benzene rings with π electron in TPPO facilitate the charge transfer between perovskite and hole-transporting layer, achieving the best power conversion efficiency of 18.29% with negligible hysteresis, as well as excellent long-term stability with remaining nearly 85% of the initial efficiency after 2000 h storage under 50% humidity ambient air. In contrast, uncharged octyl alkanes in TOPO hinder the charge transfer and lead to the accumulation of charges at interface although it is a good passivator in light emitting devices for charge confinement. Our findings shed light on the importance of efficient transfer when defect-passivation is employed in solar cell.

Abstract: In this work, porous bilayer hybrid WO3 nanoarray devices are constructed in which the active materials are composed of a crystalline WO3 nanobowl arrays layer modified by a nanoholey amorphous WO3 layer. The hybrid nanoarrays exhibit outstanding electrochromic performance with high color contrast in both visible and near infrared regions (93.9% at 633 nm, 89.6% at 1500 nm), fast response speed (3.0 s for coloring and 3.6 s for bleaching), exceptional cycling stability (95.4% contrast retention after 10,000 cycles) and decent coloring efficiency (92.3 cm2C-1) at low colored/bleached potentials (-1.0/1.0 V). In addition, the hybrid nanoarrays display high areal capacitance (47.4 mF/cm2), superior rate capability and cyclic stability (areal capacitance remains 84.0% after 2000 cycles). An electrochromic supercapacitor nanodevice is constructed based on the excellent electrochromic and capacitive performance of the hybrid nanoarrays. The enhanced electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the unique top amorphous layer structure and the underlying crystalline WO3 layer. In addition, oxygen partial pressure plays a crucial role in modulating the microstructure of the amorphous layer as well as electrochemical performance of the nanodevice. The obtained hybrid WO3 nanoarrays as well as the structure modulation promise great potential in developing high quality smart energy-efficient devices.

Abstract: Recent developments have renewed the demand for solar cells with increased tolerance to radiation damage. To investigate the specific irradiation damage of 1 MeV electron irradiation in GaInAsP lattice matched to InP for varying In and P contents, a simulation based analysis is employed: by fitting the quantum efficiency and open-circuit voltage simultaneously before and after irradiation, the induced changes in lifetime are detected. Furthermore, the reduction of irradiation damage during regeneration under typical satellite operating conditions for GEO missions (60 °C and AM0 illumination) is investigated. A clear decrease of the radiation damage is observed after post irradiation regeneration. This regeneration effect is stronger for increasing InP-fraction. It is demonstrated that the irradiation induced defect recombination coefficient for irradiation with 1 MeV electrons after regeneration for 216 h can be described with a linear function of InP-fraction between 1⋅10 −5 cm2/s for GaAs and 7⋅10−7 cm2/s for InP. The results show that GaInAsP is a promising material for radiation hard space solar cells.

Abstract: In concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies, the absorber material should be spectrally selective under severe operating conditions, i.e., ~1000 °C under air atmosphere. SiC–TiC nanocomposites could be good candidates for this application due to their spectral selectivity at room temperature; however, their behaviour under CSP operating conditions is unknown. Therefore, the spectral selectivity and oxidation resistance of TiC–SiC composites were studied up to 500 °C, in air, and at various compositions. During heating, the emittance increased with the temperature. After heating, the TiC grains at the surface were oxidized to TiO2, while SiC grains showed good behaviour. However, despite little oxidation, the spectral selectivity of the nanocomposites remained interesting after heating. Specific oxidation tests of up to 9 days at 1000 °C in air showed an increase in the oxidation resistance with the amount of SiC. This result is the consequence of the formation of a protective layer of SiO2 that prevents oxidation of the TiC grains. The composition of 30 at% TiC–70 at% SiC is a good compromise between low oxidation and good selectivity.

Abstract: In this work, we have investigated Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cells made from oxide, oxy-sulfide and sulfide precursors produced by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Although sulfide precursors are widely used to fabricate CZTS solar cells, Sn loss is commonly observed due to the high volatility of SnxSy species during high temperature sulfurization. This can lead to a non-ideal absorber composition and a high density of detrimental Sn-related defects that severely affect the performance of the device. By using oxide precursors, we have shown that the Sn loss can be significantly reduced due to the higher thermal stability of SnxOy species when compared to their sulfide counterparts. However, the reaction mechanism for the oxide route results in rough CZTS films. We hypothesize that the SO2 gas that forms during the conversion from oxide to sulfide is trapped in the film during sulfurization, and can lead to grains with hollow cavities and thus increase the surface roughness. Therefore, we have developed an annealing route for the oxide precursors at lower annealing pressures, which leads to improved film morphology and device performance. As a result, we report a power conversion efficiency of 5.4% for solar cells made from oxide precursors. This is the highest value reported for a CZTS absorber produced by PLD.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary malignancy of bone with a tendency to metastasize early. An understanding of the pathways that regulate OS metastasis is required for the design of novel treatment approaches. Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) is upregulated and functions as a potential tumor promoter in diverse human cancers, but has yet to be investigated in the OS. In the present study, results showed that SPAG5 expression is upregulated in OS tissues, and SPAG5 overexpression is obviously associated with the malignant phenotype and poor survival in patients with OS. Multivariate analyses also revealed that SPAG5 overexpression is an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome of patients with OS. The functional assay indicated that SPAG5 silencing significantly inhibits the invasion and migration of OS cells in vitro. Additionally, knockdown of SPAG5 in OS cells suppresses lung metastasis in vivo. Further, we also found that SPAG5 silencing inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of OS cells. Moreover, our results indicated that SPAG5 promotes OS metastasis by increasing matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) expression, and demonstrated that MMP2 is crucial for the pro-metastasis role of SPAG5 in OS cells. Mechanistically, we identified that SPAG5 regulates MMP2 expression by modulating FOXM1 (Forkhead box M1) degradation to enhance the protein stability of FOXM1. Collectively, these findings describe the effects of SPAG5-FOXM1-MMP2 axis in the regulation of OS cell migration and metastasis formation. We provide a novel evidence that SPAG5 may serve as a prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target for patients with osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Combining hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) and photovoltaic/phase change material (PV/PCM) systems in a so called hybrid PV/T/PCM system is a potential solution for the high temperature gradients and unsatisfactory thermal regulation in conventional PV/T systems. Several combinations of different PCMs and different types of nanomaterials at different loadings are employed in this study to overcome the increased PV-temperature levels in the presence of a PCM and improve both the cooling and the thermal regulation of hybrid systems. A finite difference numerical model was developed and validated to evaluate the average PV panel temperature, the temperature gain across the cooling fluid, the thermal and electrical efficiencies, and the temperature distribution along the PV panel for the hybrid PV/T/nano-enhanced PCM system. The effects of the solar concentration and the operation season (summer or winter) were also assessed. Four types of PCMs and four nanoparticle materials were used at high loadings of 10 wt %, 20 wt %, and 30 wt %. When paraffin wax RT35 is used as the PCM, although the temperature increasing magnitude along the panel decreases from 41% to 12%, PV-temperature levels increase compared to the conventional PV/T system (65 °C with RT35 compared to 47.5 °C without a PCM). Increasing the loading of nanoparticles in a PCM provides better cooling and improved overall performance. Among the nanomaterials, Multi-walled carbon nanotube is the best to obtain better cooling (52 °C for RT35/MWCNT at a loading of nanoparticles of 10 wt %) and higher overall performance. Also, the addition of nanoparticles is more effective at higher solar concentrations. The CaCl2.6H2O PCM provides better performance and relatively lower temperature levels, while the RT35 provides better thermal regulation of the PV panel, but at relatively higher temperature levels. No previous work has been conducted to study the effect of different combinations from the nano-enhanced PCMs on the performance and thermal regulation of the new hybrid PV/T/nanoPCM systems. In addition, the study is the first to assess their effect at high loadings of the nanomaterials and under different solar concentrations in summer and winter.

Abstract: Graphite crucibles are potentially interesting for the directional solidification processing of photovoltaic silicon, because, contrarily to standard silica crucibles, they can be used many times. In the present work, two types of graphite crucibles are studied: i) graphite directly coated with the Si3N4 powder classically used as a releasing layer for standard silica crucibles, and ii) graphite protected by a dense SiC layer before deposition of the releasing coating. In both cases, spontaneous detachment of the silicon ingot is observed to occur during cooling. Results are given and discussed concerning the impurities introduced in the silicon during the melting-solidification cycle, as well as their consequences on the photo-electrical characteristics of silicon. These results are compared with those obtained using the standard silica crucible. It is shown that re-useable SiC protected graphite crucibles lead to the same performances as standard silica. Reproducible results are found after four runs with the same crucible, and no degradation of the crucible is observed.

Abstract: Doped polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si), when coupled with a thin SiO2 interlayer, is of large interest for crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells due to its outstanding passivating contact properties. To reach high levels of surface passivation, it is pivotal to hydrogenate the poly-Si and the underlying c-Si/SiO2 interface. This can be done by capping the poly-Si with a hydrogen-containing dielectric layer such as Al2O3 or SiNx, followed by a thermal anneal. On the basis of recent research, this work addresses several aspects of such hydrogenation by dielectric materials, including the effect of the annealing ambient, the thermal stability and reversibility of hydrogenation, the poly-Si doping level and c-Si surface texture. Additionally, the implementation of hydrogenation of poly-Si by dielectric materials in solar cells is discussed.

Abstract: In this paper, alternating electromagnetic field and directional solidification are used to separate SiC and Si3N4 in polycrystalline silicon tailings. It is found the inclusion particles move downward at the center of the ingot and moving upward at the edge of the ingot by a variety of forces during the directional solidification process. The electromagnetic force accelerates the melt flow and enhances the lift force, so that larger particles can be pushed to the top of the ingot. Rod-shaped Si3N4 and block-shaped SiC particles show symbiotic relationship between each other. The aggregation of inclusion particles adsorbs metallic impurities, especially volatile metals, due to the effects of mushy region and short-circuit diffusion. The average conversion efficiency of the solar cells (Al-BSF method) prepared using the recycled silicon reached 18.56%, which meets the demand of the solar cells.

Abstract: We have investigated new nano materials for their applicability as ice/snow melting agents. They are based on nano-textured anti-reflective (hence black) Si and compared with standard agents used in the industry. Nano-needles of black-Si decrease surface reflectance and enhance absorption of sunlight by Si. The effective ice/snow melting properties of the black-Si based samples outperform the most widely used chaff charcoal. This newest solar photo-thermal conversion material/agent has high potential to the farming in early springs at relative cold regions.

Abstract: The development of lightweight and flexible solar modules is highly desirable for high specific power applications, building integrated photovoltaics, unmanned aerial vehicles and space. Flexible metallic and polyimide foils are frequently used, but in this work an alternative substrate with attractive properties, ultra-thin glass (UTG) has been employed. CdTe solar cells with average efficiency reaching 14.7% AM1.5G efficiency have been produced on UTG of 100 μm thickness. Little has been reported on the effects on PV performance when flexed, so we investigated the effects on J-V parameters when the measurements were performed in 40 mm and 32 mm bend radius, and in a planar state before and after the bend curvature was applied. The flat J-V measurements after 32 mm bending test showed some improvement in efficiency, Voc and FF, with values higher than the first measurement in a planar state. In addition, two CdTe solar cells with identical initial performance were subjected to 32 mm static bending test for 168 hours, the results showed excellent uniformity and stability and no significant variation on J-V parameters was observed. External quantum efficiency and capacitance voltage measurements were performed and showed no significant change in spectral response or carrier concentration. Residual stress analysis showed that no additional strain was induced within the film after the bending test and that the overall strain was low. This has demonstrated the feasibility of using CdTe solar cells on UTG in new applications, when a curved module is required without compromising performance.

Abstract: Whereas there are numerous studies dedicated to the corrosion performance of different grades of austenitic stainless steel (ASS) exposed to the conditions of thermal storage of solar energy, there is no data concerning the resistance of the welding joints, which are unavoidable when fabricating large structures. Because the microstructure of a weld bead can significantly differ from that of the base metal and the heat-affected zone (HAZ), increased susceptibility to localized corrosion can be expected. This work explores corrosion resistance of a welding joint of ASS grade 316 L when exposed to molten Solar Salt (60% NaNO3 – 40% KNO3) at 565 °C. Further, the application of laser surface melting (LSM) is proposed as a method to modify the microstructure of the weld bead and HAZ to enhance the corrosion resistance of the joint. Isothermal exposure to molten Solar Salt was implemented in static immersion, in the presence of atmospheric air, for the duration of up to 1008 h (6 weeks). The gravimetric analysis revealed a corrosion rate of 54 μm/y at the weld joint, which is at least twice as high as that expected for the same non-welded alloy in similar conditions. Although LSM reduces the rate of uniform corrosion in the first 2 weeks, there is no long term benefit in this regard. However, the onset of localized corrosion of the intergranular type is effectively prevented, presenting a potential approach for diminishing the risk of catastrophic failure of HAZ by fracture.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) backsheets provide critical moisture, mechanical, and electrical insulation to the backside of PV modules, but their continued functionality depends upon their ability to remain well adhered over years of harsh environmental exposure. A study of adhesive strength was conducted on several PV backsheet types exposed to indoor accelerated weathering. Two adhesion tests – the wedge test and single cantilever beam test – were used to measure adhesion energy in four backsheets: two with fluoropolymer-based outer (airside) layers – polyvinyl fluoride (PVF), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) – and two with non-fluoropolymer-based outer layers–polyamide (PA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The effects of changes in temperature, ultraviolet (UV) irradiance, relative humidity, and a periodic water spray were studied. The PET-, PVF- and PVDF-based backsheets all showed instances of debonding in an adhesive layer, which is commonly reported. For the PA-, PET-, and PVDF-based backsheets, adhesion energy dropped fairly rapidly with exposure, reaching very low levels by 4000 h. The PVF-based backsheet was relatively robust to weathering. Pull-off of an outer chalking layer in the PA- and PET-based backsheets suggested a sensitivity to UV. Adhesion in these two backsheets was also highly sensitive to changes in moisture level. Changes in UV irradiance and temperature did not show a statistically significant effect on adhesion loss for the exposure levels used. The present work is part of a two-part adhesion study on both field-weathered and indoor-exposed backsheets, and forms a basis for understanding adhesion degradation across a variety of backsheet types and degradation factors.

Abstract: Modifications to the buffer structure in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells are examined in terms of power conversion efficiency and metastability. Varying amounts of thin hole-injecting layers are introduced at different locations in the CIGS/Zn(O,S) device structure. It is found that such layers simultaneously increase performance and decrease metastability. The most effective variant produces devices without metastability and with higher efficiency than the CdS-only controls. The most effective location for hole injection is found to be between the Zn(O,S) buffer and the transparent conductor. At this location, passivation of the CIGS surface is not a function of the hole injection layer, and thus a variety of materials with appropriate band-edge energies should achieve the same purpose.

Abstract: Efficient solar evaporation requires photothermal conversion materials with broad band absorption in solar spectrum, high specific area for water evaporation, and sufficient water transport paths. In the current work, porous carbonaceous membrane consists of continuous ultrafine carbon fibers was prepared by electrospinning followed by carbonation and oxidation. The carbonaceous membrane can absorb more than 95% of incident solar energy in the range from 250 to 2500 nm. The carbonaceous membrane has hydrophilic characteristics and continuous channels for sufficient water transport. The ultrafine carbon fibers on the surface of the membrane provide tremendous interfaces for water evaporation. With localized heating design, the carbonaceous membrane delivers a water evaporation rate of 1.33 kg m−2 h−1 and a solar evaporation efficiency of 81.71%. It is also demonstrated that the carbonaceous membrane can recover fresh water from seawater, acid solutions and alkali solutions. Furthermore, the carbonaceous membrane shows the potential of electricity generation driven by solar evaporation.

Abstract: ZrW2O8 with excellent negative thermal expansion coefficient and anti-reflective property, was successfully introduced onto VO2 thermochromic films. With an increase in temperature, thermal expansion mismatch appears at the interface between VO2 and ZrW2O8 layers, and the concave-shaped structures are formed to collect more light. Additionally, ZrW2O8 serves as an anti-reflective coating, which results in a significant enhancement in luminous transmittance. The luminous transmittance of VO2/ZrW2O8 and ZrW2O8/VO2/ZrW2O8 films is 71.9% and 75.7%, respectively, which have shown significant improvement compared to 39.8% for intrinsic VO2 film. In addition, the solar modulation value of VO2/ZrW2O8 and ZrW2O8/VO2/ZrW2O8 films have also been improved compared to VO2 film, and the obtained value for bi-layer film is higher than that of tri-layer film. The results obtained for VO2/ZrW2O8 and ZrW2O8/VO2/ZrW2O8 films have shown a remarkable improvement over other bi-layer or tri-layer structures. The described VO2/ZrW2O8 and ZrW2O8/VO2/ZrW2O8 films with enhanced luminous transmittance and solar modulation make them promising materials for the application in smart windows.

Abstract: Despite huge progress in the fields of newborn screening, encapsulated bacterial infection prophylaxis, immunization, and supportive care in general, people suffering from sickle cell anemia still continue to have a shorter life expectancy and a poorer quality of life due to painful vaso-occlusive events and strokes during childhood, and later, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal injuries, including in Western and high-income countries. From the 2000s, allogeneic stem cell transplantation for severe sickle cell disease from a sibling donor provided the best results—overall as well as disease-free survival—never obtained for any other disease. Nevertheless, this only curative option is proposed to few patient numbers, including in Western countries with high-level medical equipment development, with discrepancies between (i) patients and family, (ii) physicians and care centers dedicated to sickle cell disease, and (iii) hematopoietic stem cell transplant teams. Due to these discrepancies and in order to provide the same quality of discussion and treatment choice for every sickle cell disease patient, we developed a National French multidisciplinary pluri-annual meeting dedicated to sickle cell disease patients and transplantation. We report here our experience of such a meeting.

Abstract: This work aims to prepare potential solar thermal energy storage coating using melamine-formaldehyde (MF) microcapsules with an n-Tetracosane (n-Tetra) core as phase change material (PCM). The shell material was prepared by reacting melamine with formaldehyde using a two-step process. After centrifuging and drying, these microcapsules were incorporated (0–25 wt%) into an epoxy primer-polyurethane (EP-PU) topcoat system for thermal energy storage applications. The microcapsules were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM) & Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), respectively. n-Tetra, incorporated in the microcapsule (MF-n-Tetra), has been found to melt at 53.07 °C with the latent heat of melting 134.74 J/g and crystallizes at 48.81 with latent heat crystallization 133.32 J/g. The phase change properties of the coated material were found to increase with the increase in the microcapsule loading. The thermal energy transfer rate was quantified in terms of the time taken by the coated panels to reach an equilibrium temperature of 60 °C. The microcapsule incorporated coatings were also subjected to salt spray analysis to understand any potential effects of phase change material (PCM) loading on the corrosion resistance aspect of the primer-topcoat system. The corrosion resistance was found to increase with microcapsule addition. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) indicated enhanced thermal stability of Tetra in the microcapsule.

Abstract: This paper concerns the development of a metal composite containing aluminium as phase change material (PCM) and alumina as structural supporting material (SSM) by the cold compression-hot sintering (CCHS) approach. The microstructural characteristics, thermal and mechanical properties and thermal performance of the proposed composite are characterized. For comparison, a salt composite made of NaLiCO3 as PCM and MgO as SSM with the same melting temperature as the proposed composite is also prepared and investigated. The results indicate that the alumina is wettable with liquid aluminium at elevated temperature, establishing confidence in fabrication of such aluminium composite through CCHS technique. The composite has good chemical compatibility with the melting temperature around 660 °C, and 45% alumina gives the composite optimal formulation at which a thermal conductivity of 3.75 W/m·K, a mechanical strength of 33 MPa and a thermal energy storage density of 400 kJ/kg over temperature range of 500–700 °C can be achieved. The results also indicate that the aluminium composite presents a higher thermal performance than the salt composite. At the same working conditions, the aluminium composite thermal conductivity is over twice as high as that the salt composite while maintaining a similar thermal energy storage density with salt composite.

Abstract: Intrinsic defect density in polycrystalline halide perovskite films are required to be low enough to suppress charge recombination loss for improvement in performance of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). In this paper, we propose the use of amphoteric imidazole to achieve high crystalline quality of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorption layer. The imidazole additive plays a synergistic role in controlling the perovskite crystal growth for large grain size and passivating the uncoordinated ions (e.g., Pb2+) defects, resulting in improved carrier transport/lifetime and suppressed non-radiative recombination. The champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PeSCs with imidazole is improved to 16.88%, from the control device with a PCE value of 14.65%. Besides, the stability of imidazole modified perovskite films is further improved by limiting ion immigration at grain boundaries against moisture and heat stresses. The findings pave an avenue for synergistically modulating crystallization and healing defect in perovskite to achieve efficient and stable solar cells.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the effect of Zn1-yMgyO/ZnO1-xSx double buffer layers on the antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) solar cells performance. Our results show that the magnesium and sulfur concentrations in proposed double buffer layers have a significant effect on the band alignment optimization at the junctions. The flexibility with Zn1-yMgyO/ZnO1-xSx double buffer layers ranging from 0 to 25% magnesium and 10%–70% sulfur allows an optimal conduction band offset (CBO) for Sb2Se3 solar cells. An improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) was observed in the Sb2Se3 solar cell with Zn0.93Mg0.07O/ZnO0.4S0.6 proposed double buffer layers due to appropriate CBO values at the junction interfaces. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) values increased as the sulfur concentration in the ZnO1-xSx buffer layer increased from 0 to 0.7 (x value), which could be related to the increase in the optical band gap of the ZnO1-xSx layer. The results demonstrated that under small positive offset conditions (spike-like), the carrier recombination rate at the interface is reduced, and consequently, the Sb2Se3 solar cell performance is improved. A Sb2Se3 solar cell with the optimum CBO amount (+0.3 eV) represented a conversion efficiency of 15.46%, which exhibited a 68% enhancement in comparison to the traditional CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cell.

Abstract: Next-generation concentrating solar power (CSP) technology requires a high-temperature heat-transfer fluid and thermal energy storage media. Molten MgCl2-KCl-NaCl is considered a potential candidate salt due to its thermophysical properties. However, MgCl2 presents various challenges because of its hygroscopic nature. To keep corrosion under control, this molten chloride needs to remain free of hydrates and other impurities. Here, we have developed an effective purification method for MgCl2-containing salts by 1) combining known laboratory-scale, batch-style thermal and chemical purification processes to enable scalable, continuous-style processes for commercial next-generation CSP operation; 2) improving overall efficiency and minimizing the major corrosive impurity MgOHCl by optimizing key engineering parameters such as heating temperature/time and amount of elemental Mg addition; and 3) investigating the addition of halite (NaCl) to carnallite (KMgCl3) to reduce the liquidus temperature. Laboratory-scale results suggest that 1) adding 6.5 wt% of halite and less than 0.1 wt% of elemental Mg to commercial carnallite and 2) following a heating schedule to at least 650 °C with ~3 h of holding time at that temperature can produce a ternary MgCl2-KCl-NaCl salt composition with a low liquidus temperature of about 400 °C. It also reduces the presence of the corrosive impurity, MgOHCl, from ~1 to 2 wt.% to ~0.1 wt%. Findings of these key engineering parameters should provide a pathway toward a scalable, continuous-style salt-purification process at a scale of metric tons per hour that can produce a corrosion-controlled chloride molten salt for CSP applications.

Abstract: The front cover glass required for photovoltaic (PV) module insulation is the first surface in receiving irradiation towards solar cell, and the first surface in limiting the photon flux impinging it due to optical losses, which can be counteracted by means of antireflective (AR) coatings. The soiling adherence inherently disrupts the intended function of the AR coatings, thus reducing the power output of the PV plants. In this work, hydrophobicity of highly antireflective layer stacks was pursued to deal against soiling adherence. Whereas antireflection property has a direct effect on the minimization of cell-to-module losses, antisoiling property reduces maintenance expenditures, both contributing to the reduction of levelized cost of energy. Properties of methyl-silylated silica and polyfluoroalkyl-silica mono- and bi-layer stacks were compared to achieve the most rational AR design based on a proper trade-off between cost-efficiency, processability, optical properties, mechanical properties and reliability during real life operation. Nanoindentation permitted to compare hardness of different coatings; cohesion and adhesion were studied by nanoscratch, both related to cleaning resistance studied by reciprocating wear test. Effect of AR layer stacks on electrical response of monocrystalline silicon cells was assessed during outdoor exposure as well as the effect of environmental relative humidity on the optical properties. Methyl-silylated silica mono-layer and polyfluoroalkyl-silica bi-layer both prepared in two-steps were the more rational designs based on adhesion, mechanical properties and abrasion resistance to cleaning process. They showed an equivalent overgeneration of 2% when applied on cover glass of PV mono-modules compared to uncoated ones along one-year exposure.

Abstract: The Si–SiO2 interface has and will continue to play a major role in the development of silicon photovoltaic devices. This work presents a detailed examination of how charge at or near this interface influences device performance. New understanding is identified on the effect of charge-induced potential fluctuations at the silicon surface. Such fluctuations have been considered in Si–SiO2 recombination models previously, where a universal value of electrical potential deviation was used to represent the effect. However, the approach disregards that the variation occurs in the charge concentration rather than the potential. We modify the models to accurately reflect fluctuations in external charge, allowing a precise representation of surface recombination velocity, with self-consistent Dit, σp, and σn parameters. Correctly accounting for these parameters can provide insights into the passivation mechanisms which can aid the development of future devices. Using the corrected model, we find that the effect of charge fluctuation at the Si–SiO2 interface is significant for the depletion regime to the weak inversion regime. This indicates that surface passivation dielectrics must operate with charge concentrations in excess of 2x1012 q/cm2 to avoid these effects. TCAD device simulations show that the efficiency of future PERC cells can improve up to 1% absolute when optimally charged dielectric coatings are applied both at the front and rear surfaces.

Abstract: NTCP (SLC10A1) has been well recognized as a basolateral (sinusoidal) Na+-bile acid co-transporter that mediates the hepatic uptake of bile acids. However, little is known about the effects of NTCP (SLC10A1) on hepatoblastoma (HB) and its underlying metabolic mechanisms. In this study, we found that NTCP (SLC10A1) expression was downregulated in HB cells and tissues, and it was demonstrated that NTCP (SLC10A1) reduced cell viability, promoted cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis of HB cells. The metabolic profiles of HB cells with NTCP (SLC10A1) overexpression were further examined to determine their biochemical alterations and deepen our understanding on the metabolic regulation of NTCP (SLC10A1) overexpression. The metabolomics study based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed alterations in the metabolites of HB cells following NTCP (SLC10A1) overexpression. Next, we stably overexpressed NTCP (SLC10A1) in HepG2 cells, and found that NTCP (SLC10A1)-overexpressing cells could inhibit the production of adenosine and decreased both mRNA and protein levels of HIF1α. Further overexpression of HIF1α in the NTCP (SLC10A1)-overexpression group restored the production of adenosine. Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence that NTCP (SLC10A1) overexpression significantly disrupts the metabolism of adenosine in HB cells and highlight that NTCP (SLC10A1) mediates adenosine production mainly through HIF1α.

Abstract: Bulk transition metal dichalcogenides are indirect gap semiconductors with optical gaps in the range of 0.7–1.6 eV, which makes them suitable for solar cell applications. In this work, we study the electronic structure, optical properties, and the thickness dependence of the solar cell efficiencies of MX2 (M: Mo, W; X: S, Se, Te) with density functional theory and GW + BSE. Through this analysis, we find a change in solar cell efficiency trends at slab thicknesses of 3 μm. For thin films solar cells (thicknesses smaller than 3 μm), the tellurides present the highest efficiencies (about 20% for a 100 nm thick slab). In contrast, for thicknesses greater than 3 μm, our results indicate that a maximum solar cell efficiency can be achieved in WS2. For instance, a 100 μm slab of WS2 presents a solar cell efficiency of 36.3%, making this material a promising candidate for solar cell applications.

Abstract: Phase change material (PCM) slurry with nanoparticles added has been proved to improve the performance of solar thermal storage. While, it is found that previous studies have not systematically dealt with the thermo-physical properties of PCM slurry (PCS) based on the type and mass fraction of nanoparticles and its stability and viscosity. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to experimentally evaluate the effects of nanoparticles and dispersants on the thermal-physical properties of PCS and determine the role and the associated optimal mass fraction ratio of dispersants in promoting the stability of suspension. The 30% mass fraction alkyl hydrocarbon PCS was employed for our study. Three types of nanoparticles (i.e., Cu, Al2O3 and TiO2) were selected for the study on performance improvement of PCS. Static and dynamic stability were measured by the static precipitation method and thermal cycle method. Thermo-physical properties including viscosity, thermal conductivity and latent heat were measured by a digital display rotary viscometer, a thermal conductivity measuring instrument and a differential scanning calorimeter, respectively. The experimental results revealed that the nanoparticles can improve the thermal properties of PCS, while the dispersants can improve the stability of the nano-enhanced PCS. The PCS with 0.1% TiO2 added had the best latent heat property and minimum viscosity. The 30% mass fraction PCS with 0.1% TiO2 and 0.1% SDBS added was the ideal choice for the application on low temperature solar energy collection.

Abstract: Objectives
To compare mechanobiological response of synovial fibroblasts (SFb) from OA patient cohorts under mechanical load and inflammatory stressors for better understanding of SFb homeostatic functions.
Methods
Primary SFb isolated from knee synovium of OA obese (OA-ob:SFb), OA-pre-obese (OA-Pob:SFb), non-OA arthroscopic (scope:SFb), and non-OA arthroscopic with cartilage damage (scope-CD:SFb) were exposed to OA-conditioned media (OACM), derived from OA obese (OA-ob:CM), OA-pre-obese (OA-Pob:CM), and mechanical stretch at either 0 %, 6 % or 10 % for 24 h. Differences in the mRNA levels of genes involved in extracellular matrix production, inflammation and secretory activity were measured.
Results
Despite the significant BMI differences between the OA-ob and OA-Pob groups, OA-Pob has more patients with underlying dyslipidaemia, and low-grade synovitis with higher levels of secreted proteins, CXCL8, COL4A1, CCL4, SPARC and FGF2 in OA-Pob:CM. All primary SFb exhibited anti-proliferative activity with both OA-CM. Mechanical stretch stimulated lubricin production in scope:SFb, higher TGFβ1 and COL1A1 expressions in scope-CD:SFb. OA-Pob:CM stimulated greater detrimental effects than the OA-ob:CM, with higher pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1β, IL6, COX2 and proteases such as aggrecanases, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5, and lower ECM matrix, COL1A1 expressions in all SFb. OA-ob:SFb were unresponsive but expressed higher pro-inflammatory cytokines under OA-Pob:CM treatment.
Conclusion
Both mechanical and inflammatory stressors regulate SFb molecular functions with heterogeneity in responses that are dependent on their pathological tissue of origins. While mechanical stretch promotes a favorable effect with enhanced lubricin production in scope:SFb and TGFβ1 and COL1A1 in scope-CD:SFb, the presence of excessively high OA-associated inflammatory mediators in OA-Pob:CM, predominantly SPARC, CXCL8 and FGF2 drive all SFb regardless of pathology, towards greater pro-inflammatory activities.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate circular RNA (circRNA) expression profile via microarray, and further assess the potential of candidate circRNAs as biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Methods
CircRNA expression profile in cerebrospinal fluid from 8 AD patients and 8 control (Ctrl) subjects was assessed by microarray. Subsequently, 10 candidate circRNAs from microarray were validated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in cerebrospinal fluid from 80 AD patients and 40 Ctrl subjects.
Results
By microarray, 112 circRNAs were upregulated and 51 circRNAs were downregulated in AD patients compared with Ctrl subjects, and these circRNAs were enriched in AD related pathways such as neurotrophin signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and cholinergic synapse. By RT-qPCR, circ-LPAR1, circ-AXL and circ-GPHN were increased, whereas circ-PCCA, circ-HAUS4, circ-KIF18B and circ-TTC39C were decreased in AD patients compared with Ctrl subjects, and these circRNAs were disclosed to predict AD risk by receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Further forward-stepwise multivariate logistic regression revealed that circ-AXL, circ-GPHN, circ-ITPR3, circ-PCCA and cic-TTC39C were independent predictive factors for AD risk. Besides, in AD patients, circ-AXL and circ-GPHN negatively correlated, while circ-PCCA and circ-HAUS4 positively correlated with mini–mental state examination score; Circ-AXL negatively correlated, while circ-PCCA, circ-HAUS4 and circ-KIF18B positively correlated with Aβ42; Circ-AXL and circ-GPHN positively correlated, whereas circ-HAUS4 negatively correlated with t-tau; Circ-AXL positively correlated with p-tau.
Conclusion
Our study provides an overview of circRNA expression profile in AD, and identifies that circ-AXL, circ-GPHN and circ-PCCA hold clinical implications for guiding disease management in AD patients.

Abstract: Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a p-type semiconductor, considered as an excellent photovoltaic absorber for its high absorption coefficient in the visible region and a nearly optimal band-gap for single-junction solar cells. The simple binary composition, together with non-toxic and earth-abundant constituents make this material very promising toward industrial production of low-cost thin-film solar cells. Theoretical calculations and experimental data have confirmed that Sb2Se3 exhibits strong anisotropic optoelectronic properties, due to the presence of infinite covalent (Sb4Se6)n ribbons along the (001) direction, whereas weak van der Waals interactions occur between ribbons. In such anisotropic materials, electronic transport is strongly affected by crystal structure: when ribbons are aligned perpendicularly to the solar cell surface, a better collection of photogenerated current occurs, leading to larger photovoltaic conversion efficiencies. In order to understand the alignment mechanisms of ribbons, Sb2Se3 thin films were grown by Low-Temperature Pulsed Electron Deposition (LT-PED) technique at different temperatures (from 200 °C to 400 °C) on a variety of substrates, such as glass, molybdenum, CdS, Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) and nanostructured ZnO. The structural and morphological characterization of the Sb2Se3 films, performed by out-of-plane and in-plane X-Ray Diffraction and micro-Raman spectroscopy, demonstrated that ribbon alignment along the surface normal is strongly dependent on the used substrate. The comparison between solar cells grown in substrate configuration on Mo and FTO, clearly demonstrates the influence of ribbon orientation on short-circuit current.

Abstract: Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a potential absorber material for environment-friendly and cost-efficiently photovoltaics due to its material advantages and superior optoelectronic properties. In this work, we proposed a facile and versatile method of ball milling followed with spark plasma sintering (SPS) to prepare high-quality Sb2Se3 sputtering target. Then the highly crystalline Sb2Se3 thin film consisted of large crystal grains can be prepared by using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with an additional post-selenization heat treatment. An efficient substrate structured Sb2Se3 thin film solar cell with configuration of Mo/Sb2Se3/CdS/ITO/Ag was fabricated and a champion device with highly interesting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.08% has been achieved. Superior device performances are closely related to the Sb2Se3 absorber layer with benign growth orientation and the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction interface with smooth contact, which induced less recombination loss. The combined features of homemade sputtering target and advantageous thin film preparation technology further demonstrated its attractive application potential in thin film photovoltaic scenarios.

Abstract: Modeling radiative transfer on a dusty photovoltaic (PV) module is a complicated problem. In this work, an improved optical light pathway model was established based on a three-layer system (dust particles–cover glass–solar cell); this system models radiative transfer by considering absorption, reflection, and transmission. Transmittance and reflectance formulae based on the light transmission and reflection pathway were obtained. Optical experiments were conducted for incident light with a spectral range of 0.30–0.7 μm to verify the improved model. The results show that when the thickness of the particle layer was larger than the sum of the minimum and maximum diameters, the theoretical spectral transmittance and reflectance agree well with the experimental data. The relative errors of spectrum transmittance and reflectance were 1.17–16.79% and 4.17–11.68%, respectively. Spectral transmittance through the composite layers was very low, and the dust particle composition and layer thickness had strong inhibiting effects on the transmission of incident light.

Abstract: The reflectance losses are the predominate energy losses in solar radiation transfer process for the porous volumetric solar receiver. However, few studies pay attention to the influence of geometrical parameters of porous media on the reflectance losses, and the data of reflectance losses of porous volumetric solar receiver in solar spectrum is not complete. In this paper, both experimental and numerical simulation methods are applied to comprehensively investigate the reflectance losses of the porous volumetric solar receiver. A series of silicon carbide reticulated porous ceramics (SiC RPCs) is fabricated by replica method and recoating technique. The reflectance losses are measured based on UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. Meanwhile, porous models with different geometrical parameters are artificially reconstructed. Monte Carlo Ray Tracing method is used to calculate the total reflectance. The results present that the SiC RPCs exhibit small reflectance losses in the solar spectrum with a peak at about 420 nm. The geometrical parameters, such as porosity and pore diameter do not change the spectral behavior but only influence the magnitude of the reflectance. Larger porosity and larger pore diameter are beneficial for reducing the reflectance losses. The correlation of the reflectance losses as functions of pore density and porosity has been developed. Furthermore, the influence of the incident angle of radiation on reflectance losses is studied. Relatively large increase is observed as the incident angle is larger than 30°. This phenomenon becomes more obvious for the porous media with larger porosity or larger pore diameter.

Abstract: Superhydrophobic self-cleaning covers, exhibiting small roll-off angles of water droplets, mitigate the soiling of photovoltaic (PV) modules. In this work, microcone-textured fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) covers attached to the front side of PV modules offer improved performance via dual functionality, namely via self-cleaning and reduced parasitic reflection losses. The aspect ratio of the FEP microcone-textures was investigated in view of both functionalities. The best performing microcone-textured cover (aspect ratio of 0.7) demonstrated a significant enhancement in short-circuit current density (JSC) of 3.1% relative when applied to Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. Furthermore, compared to a planar FEP layer, the microcone-textures showed superior self-cleaning capability when tested using different soil types. Microcone-textured FEP recovered 100% and 65.8% of photocurrent generated when soiled with sea sand and Arizona test dust, respectively. We also present robust microcone-textured FEP covers such that superhydrophobicity was still achieved even with truncated microcones.

Abstract: Effective electron transport layers (ETLs) provide enhanced charge separation and transport, therefore as a vital part in improving the efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a new synergistic strategy using HI to passivate TiO2 film and surface while incorporating tin element into TiO2 ETL. HI is first used to control the hydrolysis of TiO2 precursors and eliminate oxygen vacancies related trap states. Then, tin element is incorporated into HI-passivated TiO2 precursor solution to construct composite TiO2/SnO2 film, affording increased electron mobility and suitable energy level. Moreover, the entire preparation process is performed under uncontrolled environmental conditions at 150 °C temperatures. Benefiting from the improved quality of the ETLs, the unencapsulated PSCs achieve optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.77% with greatly improved stability. After storage in ambient for 1450 h, the device still maintains 92% of its initial efficiency, while hold 79% PCE after 7 h of 1 sun exposure and 86% PCE after heating at 100 °C for 21 h.

Abstract: Mycobacterium smegmatis MSMEG_0129 and Rv0164, its homologue in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are single START-domain proteins essential for bacterial growth and survival, but their biochemical activities and biological roles remain undetermined. Here, we probed the possible functions of MSMEG_0129 and its underlying mechanisms by determining its cellular location, searching for its interaction partners and monitoring its transcription profile. MSMEG_0129, and Rv0164 by extension, were found to be cytosolic proteins rather than secreted components as previously understood. Increases in MSMEG_0129 expression at physiological levels accelerated bacterial growth in a proportional manner, but additional growth acceleration was not observed when MSMEG_0129 was overexpressed up to 20 fold. MSMEG_0129 is a short-lived protein, unstable at both the mRNA and protein levels. Co-IP and GST pull-down assays showed that MSMEG_0129 interacts with the ClpP2 protease and a global transcription factor, CarD, their expression being correlated with that of MSMEG_0129. Nutrient deficiency led to the downregulation of MSMEG_0129 but upregulation of CarD. However, in the context of constitutive MSMEG_0129 overexpression under nutrient-rich or starvation conditions, the mRNA level of CarD was reduced 3 fold. Conversely, expression of ClpP2 decreased with MSMEG_0129 downregulation under starvation conditions, but increased 4–8 fold when MSMEG_0129 was overexpressed. Our data suggest that MSMEG_0129, and Rv0164 by analogy, are likely to be nutrition sensing factors that regulate mycobacterial growth and may be involved in signal transfer under nutrient deficiency, possibly via physical and regulatory interactions with CarD and ClpP2.

Abstract: Intense pulsed light (IPL) is capable of entirely replacing thermal annealing (curing and contact formation) within back end processing of silicon solar cells with passivating contacts. In order to demonstrate this, full-size silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cells with IPL-processed screen-printed metal contacts are fabricated. The device with the highest conversion efficiency reaches 23.0%, which is confirmed by Fraunhofer ISE CalLab. On average, IPL-annealed SHJ cells outperform their thermally treated pendants by 0.3–0.4%abs, in particular due to higher open-circuit voltages and fill factors. To further exploit the potential of IPL, it is applied to tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon). 2 cm × 2 cm-sized p-type solar cells with TOPCon layers on both sides are fabricated. On the front they exhibit indium tin oxide (ITO) layers as well as screen-printed metal contacts which are either thermally or IPL-annealed. The trade-off between low contact resistivity at the TOPCon/ITO interface and high-quality surface passivation (open-circuit voltages of up to 709.4 mV) is balanced, which is a current challenge for the optimization of such devices. The IPL-processed cells’ series resistances do not differ significantly from those of thermally treated ones. Due to the pulse durations of several milliseconds only, IPL is very fast and offers a high throughput and, therefore, cost saving potential.

Abstract: Photovoltaic backsheets are exposed to harsh outdoor weathering conditions throughout their service lives that can compromise their protective function, through adhesive debonding between their constituent layers and between the backsheet and the module. A large-scale study on adhesive degradation was conducted on 37 field-exposed modules, that spanned 19 different module manufacturers, that were deployed among six Köppen–Geiger climatic zones, and that were fielded between 0 and 28 years. Six outer layer polymer classes were identified among the backsheets: polyamide (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl fluoride (PVF), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), fluoroethylene vinyl ether copolymer (FEVE), and tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene vinylidene fluoride copolymer (THV). Two adhesion tests were used to measure the adhesive strength: the wedge test and the width-tapered single-cantilever beam (SCB) test. Adhesion energies were compared across exposure time and Köppen–Geiger climatic zone. Many of the PET-, PVF-, and PVDF-based backsheets experienced degradation of the adhesive layer between the backsheet outer and core layers. A consistent trend of decreasing adhesion energy with exposure time was observed in five out of the six backsheet types. Trends among adhesion energy and climatic zone, while expected, were not observed, possibly due to broad ranges in temperature, humidity, and precipitation defining Köppen–Geiger climatic zones. The cantilever beam measurements produced an upper cutoff of approximately 100 J/m2, above which no modules exhibited field delamination. The results are part of a two-part study quantifying adhesion in both field-weathered and indoor-exposed PV backsheets.

Abstract: Thin-film solar cells have attracted increasing attention due to its low material cost and large flexibility, but they also face the challenge of low solar absorption due to reduced active layer thickness. Through exciting surface plasmon resonance, plasmonic metal nanoparticles are usually placed on the cell front surface to enhance solar absorption. However, if eliminating the unuseful intrinsic absorption in nanoparticles, we find that dielectric ones are better choices to enhance a-Si thin-film solar cell absorption efficiency. Moreover, a composite light trapping structure with dielectric nanoparticles on the front surface and metal hemispheres on the rear surface is proposed to achieve broadband absorption enhancement in both short and long wavelengths, with the aim to get a higher conversion efficiency. The finite-difference-time-domain simulation results show that, compared with bare 100-nm-thick amorphous silicon solar cell, the short-circuit current density and photoelectric conversion efficiency could be respectively improved by 21% and 18% with addition of optimized composite light trapping structure. The general method proposed in this study could provide valuable guidance to light trapping structure design for various kinds of thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: A dual Z-scheme fe2O3@MnO2 core/shell nanocube supported C3N4 ternary composite is rationally designed and successfully fabricated as a photocatalyst for water splitting. The as-prepared Fe2O3@MnO2/C3N4 ternary composite exhibits an enhanced visible light-induced absorbance capacity and superior photocatalytic activity for direct water splitting than that of pure g-C3N4. The photocatalytic efficiency is investigated by varying amounts of Fe2O3@MnO2 core/shell nanocubes in the ternary composite (10%wt, 20%wt and 30%wt). When the mass fraction of Fe2O3@MnO2 is determined to be 20%, the hydrogen evolution rate would achieve the maximum with a value of 124 μmol*h−1. The improved photocatalytic performance of Fe2O3@MnO2/C3N4 ternary composite can be mainly attributed to improved visible light absorption range and construction of an effective dual Z-scheme interfacial heterojunction with a rapid separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs.

Abstract: We present a novel, low temperature approach to multijunction solar cell fabrication combining the high efficiency multi-junction concept with the low cost of thin film technology in one solar cell structure. The intermetallic bonding approach presented is based on joining indium metal which has been deposited on the metal contact grid of the respective solar cells. This approach avoids the problems of lattice mismatch and tunnel junction limitations, connecting solar cells of potentially any material with patterned contacts. No measurable increase in resistance has been measured between bonded materials. This method allows the independent development of each cell technology for use in multijunction solar cells. This technique can be applied to any commercial off-the-shelf solar cells, if available. A GaAs/Si multijunction solar cell bonded using this approach is demonstrated.

Abstract: Planar-structure perovskite solar cells have attracted more and more attention, because their simple and low-temperature preparation processing. However, the performance of perovskite solar cells is currently limited by defect-induced recombination at interfaces between perovskite and charge transport layers. In this work, a filmy poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer introduced in Perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface to passivate the interfacial and interganular defects, by which a high open-circuit voltage (1.18 V) is acquired, and the optimal device shows a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 20.5% and negligible hysteresis. Femtosecond transient absorption measurement confirms a significant reduction in non-radiative recombination for passivated devices. Mott-Schottky measurement indicates improved flat band potential and carrier density in passivated devices, consisting with the increased voltage. In addition, PMMA film can protect perovskite film from moisture and oxygen erosion. The unsealed device still maintains 95% of the initial efficiency under ambient conditions with 60% relative humidity for one month. This approach solves one of the main limitations of interfacial recombination and shows its potential to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells in the future.

Abstract: Polyethylene glycol (PEG)/poly Acrylic acid (PAA)/silica (SiO2) composite phase change materials (PCMs) with strong shape stability were successfully synthesized by a simultaneous sol-gel reaction, and in situ free radical polymerization. The network structure, shape stability, phase change enthalpy, and thermostability of the prepared materials were characterized through FT-IR, DSC, TGA, and XRD. The synthesized PEG/PAA/SiO2 composite PCMs with a semi-interpenetrating network (semi-IPN) exhibited a high phase change enthalpy of 172.9 J/g and strong shape stability under 355 °C. The interaction between PEG and PAA/SiO2 network was also discussed in this paper, as well as the relationship between the interaction, energy density, and shape stability. The prepared PEG/PAA/SiO2 composite PCMs provided a novel method in preparing shape stable phase change materials.

Abstract: This paper presents a colloidal binary composite phase change storage material prepared using inorganic–organic phase-change materials (PCMs) to improve the thermal conductivity of the organic PCM and solve the supercooling and phase separation problems associated with inorganic PCMs. Samples of disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DHPD)/capric acid (CA) were prepared using a sol-gel method. These samples were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal conductivity analyses, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). First, the eutectic mixture ratio for a DHPD-CA binary system was theoretically predicted. An analysis of the DSC curve and the two-phase diagram of the eutectic system reveals that the colloidal mixture is close to the eutectic state when the DHPD/CA ratio is 7:3. The results of FTIR spectroscopy and XRD revealed that DHPD and CA in the colloidal mixture did not undergo a chemical reaction, indicating the occurrence of physical mixing. Second, the melting temperature of the composite material was 33.8 °C, the degree of supercooling was 0.9 °C, the melting enthalpy of phase change was 168.8 J g−1, and the thermal conductivity was 0.468 W m−1K−1 at 15 °C. Moreover, after 300 accelerated cold–hot cycles, the thermal properties and morphology of the colloidal binary composite were stable. The addition of CA reduced the degree of supercooling of the DHPD. Furthermore, the addition of DHPD improved the phase-change latent heat and thermal conductivity of CA, thereby reducing the cost of the composite material. The material presented can be used in passive solar energy applications.

Abstract: Previous studies have considered the same temperature for all components of the silicon etching solution, and the effect of the temperature of the individual components on the etching results has not been explored. In the present study, a diamond-wire-sawn (DWS) multi-crystalline silicon wafer was etched twice for 50 s each time. The initial temperature of HF was selected to be room temperature, 55 and 66 °C, whereas those of H2O2 and Cu(NO3)2 varied between 40 and 70 °C, 40 and 72 °C, respectively. The temperature of the three components of the solution was allowed to change over time. The effects of H2O2, Cu(NO3)2, and HF temperatures on the etch morphology, reflectivity, and energy conversion efficiency of the fabricated solar cells were investigated. The saw marks of a DWS wafer were determined to be the preferred nucleation sites for the formation of the inverted pyramid (IP) structure. The optimum temperatures for etching Si to obtain a large area of IP structure were ~72 °C for Cu2+, ~25 °C for HF, and ~55 °C for H2O2. The strong isotropic etching ability of high-temperature HF caused the silicon crystal surface to deviate from the IP structure and left many recombination centers on the surface. A wafer with an IP structure on the entire surface exhibited the highest energy conversion efficiency of 18.21%. A simple wet-chemical post-processing step is expected to reduce the recombination centers and improve the energy conversion efficiency of the fabricated solar cell.

Abstract: Solar-powered vapor generation, by a strict structural design, has become one of the most effective ways to utilize solar energy for water remediation. Recently, low-cost molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) based solar evaporation systems have provided an ideal way for solar-powered vapor generation, while instability and low evaporation rate still remain as challenges. In this work, we introduce a stabilized Mo2S3 by FeS2 (Fe-Mo2S3) based porous solar evaporation system as a light-harvesting and light-thermal conversion material. The system reveals a dual feature with high light absorption and water supply, leading to a higher evaporation rate up to ~2.4 kg m-2 h-1 than MoS2 under 1 kW m-2 solar illumination. Long-time photothermal and cycle tests for brine further reveals that the porous solar evaporation system has excellent photothermal stability and relieves salt blockage problem to some extent. Meanwhile, this system can directly be used for the purification of seawater, organic solution and heavy metal ion solution. The water purification rate can reach approximately 1.76 kg m−2 h−1 under natural sun-light. It provides a very promising material for water purification, water pollution remediation and other related photothermal technologies.

Abstract: A laser texturing process including laser ablation and post-etching has been developed to form a unique microstructure of pits in craters (PIC) on the front surface of the diamond wire sawn multi-crystalline silicon (DWS mc-Si) wafer. A laser ablation is applied to produce craters with size of tens of microns distributed at the front surface of the wafer, followed by a post-etching process to remove silicon slags produced in the laser process and to form the pits of size in few microns embedded in each crater. The structural, optical and electrical characteristics of the PIC structure are investigated and optimized to achieve a good trade-off between light trapping and recombination. Finally, an applicative laser texturing process is demonstrated for the industrial-grade DWS mc-Si solar cells with an increased efficiency of 19.26% compared with the standard acid textured ones (19.10%).

Abstract: We present a systematic study on intrinsic thermal stability of a series of complex lead halides APbX3, used as absorber materials in perovskite solar cells. Mechanistically, the perovskites APbX3 were shown to decompose under thermal stress conditions initially to form PbX2 and AX salts. Thermolysis of the latter yields multiple volatile products, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry. We reconfirmed the CH3I + NH3 decomposition route for MAPbI3 and observed for the first time CH4, ethylene and HI (formed from CH3I). In case of FAPbI3, the formation of 2-aminomalononitrile (not 1,3,5-triazine as reported recently) was revealed along with NH4I and HCN. Importantly, the stability of the lead halide perovskites shows a good correlation with the volatility of univalent cation halides (or their decomposition products) incorporated in their structure. In particular, MAPbX3 have the lowest stability since they incorporate the most volatile (or easy to decompose) methylammonium halides MAX. On the contrary, all-inorganic CsPbX3 show remarkable compositional stability since CsBr and CsI are non-volatile under the solar cell operation conditions. The established relationship and material decomposition pathways provide important guidelines for rational design of novel absorber materials for perovskite solar cells with improved thermal stability suitable for terrestrial and space applications.

Abstract: Recently, the 2D perovskite layer is employed as a capping/passivating layer in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The 2D perovskite layer is prepared by inserting a large-sized hydrophobic cation spacer into the perovskite crystal lattice. The large-sized cation in the 2D perovskite lattice can successfully suppress the moisture intrusion and hence improve the stability of the PSCs. However, a deep understanding of the interfacial mechanisms at the 2D/3D heterojunction and the relative contributions of the mobile ions and trapped charge carriers is still lacking. In this work, deep levels transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and reverse DLTS (RDLTS) have been performed to characterize the n-i-p structured 3D and 2D/3D PSCs. DLTS and RDLTS have been used to distinguish between the spectral contribution made by mobile ionic species, electron/hole traps, and to investigate the presence of ordinary deep electron and hole traps in the bandgap of perovskite. Besides, the PSCs have been characterized by photoinduced voltage transient spectroscopy (PIVTS) to study the decay of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) under illumination. For both 3D and 2D/3D PSCs, the contribution of mobile ions was found to be dominant; however, in the case of 2D/3D samples, the intensity of the mobile ions signal was several times lower. The lower intensity can be correlated with a lower amplitude of slow tails in VOC decay curves in 2D/3D solar cells as compared to 3D solar cells. The PIVTS study also endorses the 2D/3D structures as more robust than the 3D structures.

Abstract: Commercially available lightweight-flexible CIGS solar cells are investigated under the Low-Intensity-Low-Temperature (LILT) conditions that exist at Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Current density-voltage measurements, concentrated solar, and external quantum efficiency measurements are performed under varying temperatures and illumination intensities to determine the applicability and performance of flexible CIGS in outer planetary conditions. The well-known metastability of the CIGS absorber is observed as a result of a barrier to minority carrier extraction at the CIGS/CdS interface under higher intensity illumination. However, despite the low temperatures and low intensities experienced in deeper space, the presence of this barrier does not significantly affect the performance of the solar cells under LILT conditions. This is attributed to the lower photogeneration rate of carriers particularly at conditions relative to Saturn and Jupiter, which appears to be less than the thermionic emission rate across the barrier and therefore the carrier extraction is relatively unaffected under these illumination conditions. At elevated temperatures and/or intensities such as at AM0 and conditions relative to Mars, however, the higher carrier generation rate results in the appearance of large series resistance and a significant loss of fill factor at irradiation levels greater than 1-sun AM0. Proton irradiation of the solar cells systematically reduces the performance, predominately through the formation of defect states in the absorber layer, the presence of which is increasingly more prohibitive in LILT conditions due to the low thermal energy of the minority carriers and the subsequent increased effect of SRH recombination.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of highly boron (B)-doped poly-silicon (p+-poly-Si) and ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) bi-layer structure, also named as p-TOPCon, as the hole-selective passivated contact on n-type c-Si wafer, where the SiOx layer is made with three methods of hot nitric acid oxidation SiOx (NAOS-SiOx), plasma-assisted nitrous-oxide (N2O) gas oxidation (PANO-SiOx), and thermal oxidation (Thermal-SiOx). We demonstrate that the SiOx has a strong influence on the passivation quality. The best result is achieved using the Thermal-SiOx, while the NAOS-SiOx is slightly inferior, but better than the PANO-SiOx. The p+-poly-Si/SiOx structures with the three SiOx layers achieve the optimized passivation quality at different annealing temperatures of 820 °C for the NAOS-SiOx, 880 °C for the PANO-SiOx, and 930 °C for the Thermal-SiOx. The other potential factors affecting the passivation quality are also studied. The most important observation is that the optimized p-TOPCon structures with the three SiOx layers have a similar B diffusion profile, which penetrates into the c-Si wafer about 50 nm with B concentration decreasing to ~1 × 1018 cm−3. However, the overall p+-poly-Si/SiOx is still much poorer than n+-poly-Si/SiOx in terms the passivation quality. The comparison of the τeff versus carrier injection intensity spectra suggests that the B–O complex is the passivation killer possibly, and the approaches to improve the p-TOPCon are searching the other elements to reduce the B–O defects. In addition, contact resistivity (ρc) measurements show that the Thermal-SiOx leads a higher ρc than the others, but its value is still low enough for high-efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Patients in need of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation often cannot find a suitable HLA-matched donor in their families and rely on unrelated donors. Individuals can register with their country’s donor registry either online or at a stem cell drive by providing consent and a tissue sample for typing.
Methods
Stem Cell Club is a donor recruitment organization in Canada that recruits Canadians as stem cell donors. This article outlines the Stem Cell Club’s protocol for donor recruitment at stem cell drives including five core components: prescreening, informed consent, registration, tissue sample collection, and reconciliation.
Results
At stem cell drives, recruiters approach individuals from the most-needed demographic groups, catch their attention, explain the purpose of the drive, and prescreen them to ensure eligibility. Recruiters then secure informed consent, educating registrants about the stem cell donation process, the risks involved, the right to withdraw, and donor–patient anonymity. Recruiters subsequently ask registrants to register by providing their contact/demographic information, completing a health questionnaire, and signing a consent form. Recruiters also guide registrants to provide a tissue sample (e.g., buccal swab) for typing. Finally, recruiters reconcile completed registration kits and prepare them for shipment to the donor registry. Data are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of stem cell drives employing this protocol on recruitment of the most-needed donor demographics and of quality donors.
Conclusion
This protocol incorporates best practices for unrelated donor recruitment. It is relevant to donor recruitment organizations worldwide seeking to improve their recruitment efforts and standardize registrant experience.

Abstract: Radiative cooling has gained considerable attention recently, mainly due to its spontaneous thermodynamic process of dissipating surplus heat from the terrestrial object to deep space without any external energy. However, challenges still remain to meet better the stringent requirement on spectral selectivity for improving the current unoptimized cooling performance, especially for the multilayer-type radiative coolers. In this work, we proposed a radiative cooler with seven layers of SiO2 and Si3N4 optimized by using the evolutionary algorithm, which firstly facilitates a high reflection of solar irradiation utilizing the optical impedance mismatch, secondly enables a broadband emissivity merely within the atmospheric window by complementary phonon resonances, and thirdly suppresses the emissivity outside the atmospheric window (not only the solar spectral range). The continuous rooftop measurement and the comprehensive calculation collectively demonstrated the excellent capability of the radiative cooler, e.g., a measured temperature drop of 8 °C and a simulated cooling power of 87 W/m2 under the sunlight of ~900 W/m2. Besides, the cooling performance can be further enhanced if exposed to a dry climate due to the high humidity during the test. Our work contributes an alternative candidate to multilayered radiative coolers with cooling performance comparable to the polymer counterparts, and as well as providing a rational design approach exploiting both the structural and material aspects for similar photothermal devices.

Abstract: This work focuses on developing a novel photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) cell combined with a solar cell for the highest efficiency, simplest process, and most energy savings to degrade organic dyes in wastewater. FTO/WO3/BiVO4 photoanode electrode fabrication was developed with the simple layer-by-layer dip coating method, which allows production to be scaled up in the future. The fabricated WO3/BiVO4 shows thin film properties of high porosity, good visible light absorption, and ability to cover the entire FTO substrate area. The developed FTO/WO3/BiVO4 electrode exhibits high oxidation activity and high durability, and it can be applied to the PEC cell prototype by working under the catalytic mechanism of light irradiation and bias potential for organic dye degradation. The novel PEC cell was especially designed to include a solar cell to convert light into electrical energy that is stored in batteries for potential bias at the anode electrode and to supply electricity to the light-irradiated electrode and solar cell panel under the electrical circuit's controller. The result shows that the developed PEC cell prototype can operate on its own without using external power and is able to degrade methylene blue and rhodamine B dyes up to 94% and 93% in 3 h, respectively. This research provides a novel, innovative PEC cell prototype that is highly effective at removing various organic dye substances, uses a simple method, offers an energy saving process, and is a very interesting way to further a large industrial dye wastewater treatment system.

Abstract: Objective
Fraxetin, extracted from the bark of Fraxinus rhynchophylla, has been shown to exhibit antitumour and anti-inflammatory pharmacological properties. However, the mechanism underlying its anticancer activity towards colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is not well understood. We aimed to determine the antitumour effect of fraxetin on COAD cell lines and elucidate its biochemical and molecular targets.
Methods
The cell lines HCT116 and DLD-1 were used to evaluate the in vitro antitumour efficacy of fraxetin. Cytotoxicity and viability were assessed by CCK-8 and plate colony formation assays. Flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis and cell cycle progression in fraxetin-treated COAD cells. Western blot, RT-qPCR, molecular docking, immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescence analyses were used to gain insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms. Preclinical curative effects were evaluated in nude mouse xenograft models.
Results
Fraxetin significantly inhibited COAD cell proliferation in both dose- and time-dependent manners, specifically by inducing S-phase cell cycle arrest and triggering intrinsic apoptosis. Additionally, the level of p-JAK2 was decreased by fraxetin via the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signalling pathway. Interestingly, in COAD cells, fraxetin directly targeted the Y1007 and Y1008 residues of JAK2 to suppress its auto- or transphosphorylation, leading to decreased activation of its downstream effector STAT3 and blocking its nuclear translocation. Finally, fraxetin exhibited good tumour growth suppression activity and low toxicity.
Conclusions
Fraxetin inhibits the proliferation of COAD cells by regulating the JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway, providing evidence that targeting JAK2 with fraxetin may offer a novel potential auxiliary therapy for COAD treatment.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage because of the late onset of symptoms, and this together with the lack of effective treatments, has meant it is associated with a very high mortality. The aberrant expression of MicroRNA (miRNA) contributes to the initiation and development of human tumors including OC. Several miRNAs are secreted by tumor cells and can be identified in body fluids. Serum miRNAs levels are associated with several clinical conditions, and may be used to predict prognosis and response to treatments in some cancers including OC. This review summarizes the current progresses regarding the potential applications of circulating miRNA as innovative biomarkers in OC.

Abstract: A novel herbal electrochromic device has been fabricated using raw hibiscus flower extract and its performance parameters have been studied. With no usage of any chemical to obtain extracts of herbal hibiscus flower is in itself a safe, economic way and a first such demonstration. Optical and electrochemical properties of the herbal extract have been studied using optical absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The Cyclic Voltammetry curves of the extracted solution shows reversible redox activity with overall reducing behaviour corresponding to less than a volt. The redox induced color switching properties of the solution is studied by monitoring the spectral changes in its as-prepared and chemically reduced forms. The color change, when mimicked using dynamic doping, can also be achieved to form a solid state electrochromic device. Performance of such a fabricated device has been studied in terms of its color modulation, switching speed and cyclability. This demonstrates the first herbal electrochromic device using natural ingredients which leads the way to have better performing sustainable and environment friendly devices.

Abstract: Through passively emitting excess heat to the outer space, radiative cooling has been demonstrated as an efficient way for energy saving applications. Instead of well-designed photonic structures, we rediscovered the potential of a bulk material as a selective emitter for sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling. The proposed cooler, consisting of a 1-mm-thick lithium fluoride crystal coated with silver backing, exhibits a low solar absorptance of 4.7% and nearly ideal infrared selectivity with high emission exactly within the atmospheric transmission band (i.e., 8–13 μm). Potentially, the cooler could achieve an ultra-low stagnation temperature up to 57 °C below the ambient. Sub-ambient daytime cooling performance was also demonstrated in an outdoor test with cooler stagnation temperature below the ambient one by 5 °C under solar irradiance above 900 W/m2 and a net cooling power of about 60 W/m2 in thermal equilibrium with the ambient. The proposed simple selective infrared emitter could efficiently and passively cool optical systems due to the wide applications of lithium fluoride crystal as optical windows and mirrors.

Abstract: Future's sustainable economy based on hydrogen will require large-scale hydrogen production processes in a CO2 emission-free way. Within this context, solar-driven thermochemical water splitting cycles have been proposed as a promising alternative for hydrogen mass production. Thermochemical processes require thermal and chemically stable reactor wall materials, which can withstand severe operating conditions, suitable for specific solar fuels production. Several unresolved issues are involved in predicting the effect of environmental degradation on the long-term performance of innovative materials for next generation solar chemical reactors to guarantee their reliability and durability under demanding working conditions. The research project ARROPAR-CEX involves a multidisciplinary team for studying novel receiver concepts and new materials, working under extreme conditions (in excess of 1000 kW/m2, and very high temperatures, typically above 1000 °C). The main objective of this work has been to develop and propose as candidate an accelerated ageing method for solar receiver’ materials, in order to estimate their degradation during lifetime under extreme solar operating conditions. A set of four selected ceramic materials have been submitted to these accelerated ageing test procedures and some preliminary conclusions on their suitability have been extracted.

Abstract: Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-reduced graphene oxide/Cu-based metal-organic framework (PrGO/HKUST-1) was electrochemically synthesized via a chronoamperometry. Structural identification, functional groups characterization, morphology and charge transfer properties of the PrGO/HKUST-1 were studied using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The PrGO/HKUST-1 exhibited a high coloration efficiency of 176.8 cm2C-1 at 500 nm with high optical contrast. An electrochromic coloration and bleaching times of 1.3 and 1.4 s were recorded at 500 nm which proved an excellent switching kinetics of PrGO/HKUST-1 compared to PEDOT (tc = 50.6 s, tb = 49.3 s), PrGO (tc = 4.6 s, tb = 5.5 s) and HKUST-1 (tc = 23.0 s, tb = 31.9 s). The charge retention of 83.4% over 900 cycles proved efficient Li+ ions diffusion into the PrGO/HKUST-1 throughout the coloration/bleaching process. Thus, the combination of PEDOT, rGO and HKUST-1 as a PrGO/HKUST-1 is a promising electrochromic display due to its excellent electrochromic performance.

Abstract: The silica sphere embedded hybrid system is a promising emitter for radiative cooling in construction applications. Optimization of its cooling performance requires a thorough understanding of how the fabrication parameters influence its cooling performance. The objective of this study was to explore the influence of the silica sphere radius, sphere volume fraction, and layer thickness on a material’s optical properties and cooling efficiency through theoretical prediction. Using OptiFDTD and Mie theory, the optical property of eight different silica sphere radii, five different silica sphere volume fractions, and five different silica-TPX layer thicknesses were simulated and analyzed. A well-validated thermal model predicted the cooling power of these scenarios under various climatic inputs. These inputs covered the common range of the related parameters in most middle and low latitude areas. The 0.3 μm and 0.5 μm radii had higher emissivity in the atmospheric window and higher cooling power under various climatic conditions. Emissivity in the atmospheric window and other infrared wavelengths increased as the silica sphere volume fraction or silica-TPX layer thickness increased. The best cooling performance was balanced between high emissivity in the 8–13 μm range and low emissivity in other infrared ranges.

Abstract: Cell adhesion molecule 4 (CADM4) is downregulated in many human cancers. However, CADM4 expression levels in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and its roles in NSCLC progression remain unknown. Our study aims to address these issues. We examined CADM4 levels in NSCLC tissues using real-time PCR and western blot. A549 and NCI-H1299 cells were then transfected with pcDNA3.1-CADM4 plasmid or siCADM4 to overexpress or knock down CADM4. Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, migration, and invasion were evaluated. NSCLC cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-CADM4 plasmid or siCADM4 were treated with SC79 or LY294002, respectively, to investigate the involvement of the Akt signaling pathway. Male nude mice were subcutaneously injected with stably transfected cells (1 × 106 cells/mice) to observe tumor growth. Stable transfectants were injected into nude mice (1 × 106 cells/mice) via tail vein to observe tumor metastasis. The results showed that CADM4 gene and protein levels in NSCLC tissues were significantly lower than those in corresponding adjacent tissues. CADM4 overexpression markedly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We also found that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2 activities were reduced. Moreover, CADM4 overexpression arrested the cell cycle at G1 phase, with the changes in expression of cell cycle regulators. The Akt signaling pathway was inhibited by CADM4 overexpression. In contrast, CADM4 knockdown showed the opposite effects. Additionally, SC79 and LY294002 reversed the effects of CADM4 overexpression and CADM4 knockdown in vitro, respectively. In xenograft models, CAMD4 overexpression suppressed, while CADM4 knockdown promoted tumor growth, accompanied by changes in Ki67 expression. In in vivo metastasis assay, CADM4 overexpression decreased, while CADM4 knockdown increased numbers of metastatic nodules in lung and liver. These evidences suggest that CADM4 may regulate NSCLC progression via the Akt signaling pathway. CADM4 may be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.

Abstract: Among common methods to form polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) films for passivating-contact solar cells, physical vapor deposition, in particular sputtering, is the safest one as it does not require any toxic gaseous precursors. One of the critical parameters to control the properties of sputtered silicon films is their deposition pressure. In this work, structural and optoelectronic characteristics of ex-situ boron-doped poly-Si/SiOx passivating contacts, formed from sputtered intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si) deposited at different pressures on top of SiOx/c-Si substrates and subjected to a high-temperature boron diffusion step, are investigated. The deposition rate and density of the as-deposited a-Si films increase with reducing pressure. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra captured from the as-deposited samples at different pressures do not show typical emissions from hydrogenated a-Si. Meanwhile, their Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectra all show Si–H stretching modes, indicating that hydrogen had been initially incorporated into the chemical SiOx layers and eventually hydrogenated the a-Si/SiOx interfaces during the sputtering process. After the high-temperature boron-diffusion step, all hydrogen-related peaks disappear. Lower pressure films (1.5 and 2.5 mTorr) show more consistent improved performance after hydrogen treatments, compared to higher pressure films (4 and 5 mTorr). The resultant passivating contacts at 2.5 mTorr achieve a low single-side recombination current density Jo of ~9 fA/cm2, whereas their contact resistivity is still low at 15 mΩ cm2.

Abstract: Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is a member of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family that contributes to tumor cell metastasis. Our previous data identified two splice variants of LOXL2 (i.e., LOXL2 Δ72 and Δ13) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells that increased cell invasiveness and migration but had lower LOX activities than wild-type LOXL2 (LOXL2 WT). We generated a series of LOXL2 deletion mutants with different deleted biochemical domains and examined the relationship between the cell migration abilities and catalytic activities, as well as subcellular locations, of these deletion mutants compared with LOXL2 WT in ESCC cells to explore the mechanism of LOXL2-driven ESCC cell migration. Our results indicated that the deletion mutants of LOXL2 had impaired deamination enzymatic activity; LOXL2 ΔSRCR4, which lacks the fourth scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain, had lower enzymatic activity; and LOXL2 Y689F had no catalytic activity compared with LOXL2 WT. However these two mutants stimulated greater cellular migration than LOXL2 WT. Furthermore, the degree of cell migration promoted by LOXL2 ΔLO (in which the LOX-like domain was deleted) was higher than that of LOXL2 WT, and LOXL2 ΔSRCR3, which does not have the third SRCR domain, had lower LOX activity and cellular migration ability than LOXL2 WT. These results suggested that LOXL2 promotes ESCC cell migration independent of catalytic activity.

Abstract: The control of defect multiplication in the upper part of seed-assisted multicrystalline silicon (SAMC-Si), also called as high-performance multi-crystalline silicon, has become crucial for the further improvement of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) crystal quality. This work investigates the impact of the temperature gradient at solid/liquid interface on the defect multiplication and solar cell performance. To get the in-time temperature gradient at solid/liquid interface, an equation and an experiment method were developed. It is found that the multiplication rate at the upper ingot is strongly relevant to the temperature gradient at solid/liquid interface. After modifying the temperature gradient, the defect density in the upper part of ingot is reduced about 40%, and the solar cell efficiency increases averagely about 0.07%. Finally, the mechanism and control of defect multiplication were discussed.

Abstract: With suitable thermophysical properties and commercial viability, molten chlorides are promising candidates to replace nitrate salts as heat transfer fluids (HTF) and thermal energy storage (TES) materials for next-generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Nevertheless, structural materials including steels and nickel-based alloys experience severe corrosion in molten chlorides. The explicit understanding of the corrosion mechanisms is therefore decisive in order to propose viable technical solutions to increase the durability of these materials. In this work, the corrosion behavior of ferritic-martensitic P91 steel and Inconel 600 nickel-based alloy is investigated in molten NaCl–KCl at 700 °C under Ar. The salt mixtures after exposure as well as the corroded samples were simultaneously characterized. The systematic metallographic study after the water-free preparation indicates that electrochemical processes play a major role in the overall corrosion mechanisms. In both P91 steel and Inconel 600, the formation of micro-galvanic pairs between Cr-rich phases (anodic sites) and the alloy matrix (cathode) leads to the selective dissolution of Cr from the alloys resulting in the formation of subsurface voids. The influence of O2 and of various alloying elements on the corrosion kinetics is discussed. Based on the experimental observations, several corrosion mechanisms combining electrochemical reactions, solid-state diffusion and chloridation-oxidation processes have to be taken into account.

Abstract: Passive daytime radiative cooling plays a significant role in various cooling operations, which helps reducing electricity consumption and decreasing electricity demand. This work presents a new double-layered radiative cooling structure composed of a transparent dipentaerythritol penta-hexa-acrylate (DPHA) top layer, modified using Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) as resonators, and a metallic Ag bottom layer (DPHA@Al2O3 NPs/Ag). The DPHA@Al2O3 NPs layer is prepared through a fast photopolymerization process. The prepared DPHA@Al2O3 NPs/Ag system exhibits a solar reflectivity of 0.9465 and long-wave infrared (the so-called atmospheric transparency window) emissivity of 0.9163. The computed radiative cooling power at 27 °C can reach up to 106.43 W m−2. A subambient temperature drop of 10.35 °C is measured from 13:00 to 16:00 p.m. in Seoul, Korea, when using the proposed material as radiative cooler. Since this structure can be applied on flexible substrate, this has far-reaching implications for future applications in wearable devices.

Abstract: Exploring the inherent spectral selectivity of ultra-high temperature ceramics is of great significance to prepare solar absorber coatings with a simple structure and low cost. The present work shows a further improvement towards the design and deposition of the multilayer spectrally selective absorber coatings based on HfB2 and ZrB2. This novel HfB2-ZrB2/ZrB2/Al2O3 solar absorber coating exhibits a high spectral selectivity (α/ε) of 0.93/0.07. Considering the application environment, the thermal shock resistance experiments are carried out at −70 °C, room temperature and 400 °C in air to test the applicability. After 5 cycling tests, the optical properties of the coating do not degrade. In addition, the detailed failure mechanism at high temperature of this coating is also investigated.

Abstract: Optical modeling of aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) silicon wafer solar cells are extended into the infrared wavelength range (300–2500 nm). The model incorporates ray tracing to account for pyramidal texture of the front silicon surface, free carrier absorption in the front emitter; bulk silicon wafer, BSF; and Lambertian scattering at the silicon back contact. Total reflectance of pyramidal textured cells with different contact geometries with and without encapsulation are simulated. Simulated reflectance and short circuit current density match well with experimental values. These physics-based optical models serve as input for evaluating optical and thermal management strategies for silicon wafer solar cells.

Abstract: The paper proposes an experimental approach to determine the external quantum efficiency of multijunction solar cells with pronounced optical coupling. A new technique based on the cascade mechanism of coupling has been elaborated to separate the influence of the induced luminescent flux from the external illumination and to establish the absolute values of photosensitivity without negative impact of optical interaction between subcells. The novelty of this work lies in the method extended to multijunction devices with N-number of subcells.

Abstract: Microencapsulated phase-change materials (MPCMs) with carbon nanotube (CNT)-enhanced fillers and binary cores, which exhibit improved thermal conductivity and an adjustable working temperature range, are highly desirable for various heat energy storage applications. However, degraded properties are usually found for the CNT-enhanced MPCMs due to the poor compatibility of CNTs with PCMs, and the existing types of binary-core MPCMs (BCMPCMs) are quite limited. Herein, we prepared a novel type of BCMPCM with a n-octadecane/n-octacosane (C18/C28) mixture as the core, octadecyl isocyanate-grafted CNTs (OICNTs) as the enhancers and melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin as the shell via in situ polymerization. Morphological and structural characterization of the OICNT-enhanced BCMPCMs demonstrated uniform distributions of OICNTs in both the core and shell. The determined phase-change temperatures were approximately 26 °C and 43 °C, with small degrees of supercooling. The phase-change enthalpy was as high as 187.9 J/g for a relatively large OICNT loading (3 wt%). Thermal conductivity measurements of the OICNT-enhanced BCMPCM/epoxy resin composites showed a 71.4% increase over that of the pure BCMPCM/epoxy resin composite. Moreover, the BCMPCMs experienced two separate temperature buffer stages resulting from the phase-change processes and exhibited a prominent thermal regulation capacity, which is of significance for their potential applications in the cooling of electronic devices, battery thermal management, utilization of waste heat, and air conditioning systems, etc.

Abstract: In the field of imaging, it is required to control the dynamic range by darkening of the overexposed parts of a scene. Up to now, conventional one-dimensional graduated filters with a fixed transmission profile are used. Making use of electrochromic materials, we present a tunable electrochromic graduated filter device with two-dimensional control. It combines multiple conventional filters in one device as its continuous transmission profile can be individually translated, rotated, stretched and adapted in absorption by means of a multiple electrode configuration. To calculate the spatial transmission and the required potential combination for the control electrodes, we establish a Finite Element Method based simulation model considering the non-linear transmission-potential response of our complementary electrochromic materials. We simulate several electrode configurations and optimize them for the highest correlation of specified and simulated transmission. Finally, we build the device using microsystem technology and demonstrate the successful operation with desired functionalities.

Abstract: As a new kind of electronic waste, waste solar cells have posed a great threat to the environment. Solar cells contain a mass of hazardous organic components, such as ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and polyethylene glycol terephthalate. The degradation of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and polyethylene glycol terephthalate may produce toxic substances to the environment. This paper proposed molecule co-fracture to dispose the organics in order to judge the hazard of degradation products to the environment. Co-fracture kinetics analysis showed that the heating rate with highest co-fracture efficient was 30 °C/min, at which the activation energy E had the largest value of 68.84 kJ/mol. The co-fracture products under different heating rates were tested. The main product was 1-hexadecanol, 2-methyl-, which had the highest yield of 44.66 wt % at the heating rate of 25 °C/min. Diisobutyl phthalate was the main hazardous product, which had highest yield was 9.75 wt % at the heating rate of 5 °C/min. Only at the heating rate of 30 °C/min, no hazardous substance was produced. Different energy supply in the system was the main reason for the different products. Molecule co-fracture was employed in this study to dispose organics in waste solar cells, which provides guidance for the disposal of waste solar cells to avoid environmental pollution.

Abstract: Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) based solar cell technology has experienced rapid development with demonstrated cell efficiency reaching ̴ 9.2% for devices in substrate configuration, hence motivating more intense research investigations. Though the effect of crystallographic orientation in this non-cubic material on device performance is now well understood, the influence of composition and intrinsic defects remains debatable. In this work we describe the fabrication and device characteristics of Sb2Se3 solar cells designed in the substrate configuration (SLG/Mo/Sb2Se3/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO). Notably, Sb2Se3 absorber layers with a predominant (hk0) orientation were deposited in a single step by e-beam evaporation of pre synthesized bulk source material. As grown precursor Sb2Se3 thin films were subjected to reactive thermal annealing treatment in the presence of Se source at different temperatures for enhancing their crystalline quality and balancing their stoichiometry. Analysis of the completed solar cells indicated improved efficiencies post reactive thermal annealing process, with the best performing devices exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (η) of ~4.34% for an absorber annealed at a temperature of 350 °C. The improved efficiency is ascribed to the observed changes in chemical composition of the absorber layer and the possible formation of related beneficial antisite defects.

Abstract: Inorganic-organic nanocomposites composed of nanoparticles and polymers offer a vast space for tuning material properties have attracted considerable interest. In this work, a nanocomposite composed of Cs0.32WO3 (CWO) nanoparticles as functional additive and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as matrix was developed for the application to energy-saving windows. The key to the process was in-situ polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomers in the presence of CWO nanoparticles, which can effectively prevent the nanoparticles from agglomeration. As a result, a homogeneous dispersion of the nanoparticles in the PMMA matrix was obtained and the nanocomposite exhibits a high visible light transmittance (>70%), a low haze (<1%) and excellent near-infrared (NIR, 780–2600 nm) blocking ability (above 90%). Furthermore, the nanocomposite has a good stability in a high temperature/humid environment. The thermal stability and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite is remained comparable with PMMA. A model house was applied to evaluate the heat shielding performance of the nanocomposite, and the results indicate that the nanocomposite is superior to ITO glass. All of these results suggest that the proposed CWO/PMMA nanocomposite is promising for the application to energy saving windows.

Abstract: This report aims to explore how LINC00691 regulates the proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer (GC). Clinical tissue and serum samples, as well as specimens in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, were used to analyse the expression of LINC00691 in GC. Our data indicated that the expression of LINC00691 in GC was significantly higher than that in healthy controls and was associated with clinicopathological features and survival time. In the GC cell lines MKN-45 and HGC-27, the knockdown of LINC00691 suppressed proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene experiments showed that LINC00691 activated Lin28 transcription. Western blot analysis indicated that the knockdown of LINC00691 contributed to the decreased expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in GC cells. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway inhibitor ruxolitinib effectively suppressed the effects of LINC00691. In addition, both LINC00691 and Lin28 promoted the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Therefore, our study clarified that LINC00691 is highly expressed in GC and is a potential biomarker for GC diagnosis and prognosis. LINC00691 promotes the proliferation and invasion of GC cells by activating Lin28 transcription and facilitating EGF expression through the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, which provides new ideas for targeted therapy of GC.
