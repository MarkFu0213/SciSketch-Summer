Abstract: Loss of skeletal muscle is a serious consequence of cancer as it leads to weakness and increased risk of death. To better understand the interplay between urothelial carcinoma and skeletal muscle wasting, cancer-induced catabolic profile and its relationship with muscle mitochondria dynamics were evaluated using a rat model of chemically induced urothelial carcinogenesis by the administration of N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN). The histologic signs of non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors observed in BBN animals were related to 17% loss of body weight and high serum levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, TWEAK, C-reactive protein, myostatin and lactate and high urinary MMPs activities, suggesting a catabolic phenotype underlying urothelial carcinoma. The 12% loss of gastrocnemius mass was related to mitochondrial dysfunction, manifested by decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes due to, at least partially, the impairment of protein quality control (PQC) systems involving the mitochondrial proteases paraplegin and Lon. This was paralleled by the accumulation of oxidatively modified mitochondrial proteins. In overall, our data emphasize the relevance of studying the regulation of PQC systems in cancer cachexia aiming to identify therapeutic targets to counteract muscle wasting.

Abstract: High-efficiency Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cells typically include CdS buffer layers deposited in a chemical bath. In this work, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 devices are presented in which the CdS buffer layer was omitted completely. Instead, low-energy ion implantation of group-II-elements (Cd, Zn, and Mg) is applied in order to establish an n-type surface layer in p-type Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers. Therefore, thermal annealing procedures were developed which lead to a full recovery of the implantation induced defects and simultaneously minimize the diffusion of the dopants. Such a treatment is shown to provide high-quality p–n junction functionality and buffer-free Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cells with open-circuit voltages close to 600mV and efficiencies exceeding 10 %.

Amadori products promote cellular senescence activating insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and down-regulating the antioxidant enzyme catalase,

Abstract: Activation of the insulin growth factor receptor-1 signaling pathways has been largely related to the aging process. Amadori products are produced in pathological conditions such as diabetes and aging, and are potentially involved in diabetic nephropathy or age-associated decline of renal function. We hypothesize that Amadori products induce senescence in primary human mesangial cells through the activation of IGF-1 receptor and investigate, in the present work, the intracellular mechanism involved after this activation. We treated cultured human mesangial cells with glycated albumin, one of the most abundant Amadori product, and senescence was assessed by determining the senescence associated β-galactosidase activity and the expression of the cell cycle regulators p53 and p21. We demonstrated that prolonged exposition (more than 24h) to glycated albumin induced senescence and, in parallel, incremented the release of IGF-1 and the activation of the IGF-1 receptor. Inhibition of the IGF-1 activation prevented the GA induced senescence. Activation of IGF-1R, after GA addition, promoted a reduction in the catalase content through the constitutive activation of Ras and erk1/2 proteins which were, in turn, responsible of the observed GA-induced senescence. In conclusion, we propose that the Amadori product, glycated albumin, promotes premature cell senescence in mesangial cells through the activation of the IGF-1 receptor and the subsequent reduction in the antioxidant enzyme catalase.

Abstract: It has been well demonstrated that excessive blood glucose level could be detrimental to the myocardial function through the variety of mechanisms, of which endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) could play an unprecedented role through the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR). Recently, reports are coming out with the evidences that UPR signaling proteins are regulated differentially depend on the experimental conditions and cell types. In addition, ERS has been proposed to be closely associated with the regulation of lipogenesis. Therefore, in this study we tried to find out the expressions of myocardial UPR signaling proteins as well as proteins involved in lipid and glucose metabolism in non-obese type 2 diabetic mellitus (DM) condition using Spontaneous Diabetic Torii (SDT) rat. We have found the significant up-regulation of oxidative, nitrosative and ERS marker proteins in the myocardium of the SDT rats, in comparison to its normal (Sprague-Dawley – SD) rats. In addition, the sub-arm of UPR signaling proteins, such as p-PERK, p-eIF2α, ATF6, CHOP/GADD153, TRAF2, apoptotic signaling proteins, such as BAD, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-7 and -12, were significantly up-regulated in the SDT rats, in comparison to the SD rats. Interestingly, there were no significant changes in the phosphorylation of IRE-1α, and XBP-1 protein expression. In addition, the proteins involved in lipid and glucose metabolisms, such as PPARα, PPARγ, CPT1, PGC-1α except GLUT4, and the proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as p-Akt and p-PI3K were shown significant attenuation in its expressions in the SDT rats, when compared with the SD rats. Taken together, it is suggested that the activation of PERK and ATF6 pathway are the major determinant rather than the IRE-1α-XBP1 pathway for the ERS-mediated metabolic dysfunction, which might eventually leads to diabetic cardiomyopathy in non-obese type 2 DM.

Abstract: Differential scanning calorimetry in combination with atomic force microscopy is used to examine the phase separation of a blended nematic liquid crystalline electron-donor and crystalline perylene electron-acceptor mixture. Separate domains of donor and acceptor material are mostly retained in the blend, although a small proportion of the acceptor, increasing with increasing donor concentration, is mixed in with the donor domains. Annealing in the nematic phase allows the donor and acceptor molecules to move and generate phase-separated domains of the required size, thus enhancing the performance of bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices based on these blends. We show that the optimum annealing temperature can be controlled by manipulation of the temperature range of the nematic phase of the donor.

Abstract: The role of cytoskeleton-associated proteins during TNF-induced apoptosis is not fully understood. A potential candidate kinase that might connect TNF signaling to actin reorganization is the death-associated protein kinase (DAPK). To identify new DAPK interaction partners in TNF-induced apoptosis, we performed a peptide array screen. We show that TNF-treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of LIMK at threonine508 and its downstream target cofilin at serine3 (p-cofilinSer3). Modulation of DAPK activity and expression by DAPK inhibitor treatment, siRNA knockdown, and overexpression affected the phosphorylation of both proteins. We propose a 3D structural model where DAPK functions as a scaffold for the LIMK/cofilin complex and triggers a closer interaction of both proteins under TNF stimulation. Upon TNF a striking redistribution of LIMK, DAPK, and cofilin to the perinuclear compartment was observed. The pro-apoptotic DAPK/LIMK/cofilin multiprotein complex was abrogated in detached cells, indicating that its signaling was no longer needed if cells committed to apoptosis. P-cofilinSer3 was strongly accumulated in cells with condensed chromatin, pronounced membrane blebs and Annexin V up-regulation. From studying different cofilinSer3 mutants we suggest that p-cofilinSer3 is an indicator of TNF-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our findings identify a novel molecular cytoskeleton-associated mechanism in TNF-induced DAPK-dependent apoptosis.

Abstract: Diffusion parameters including the ambient gas, temperature, and time for the phosphorus diffusion process were examined and optimized for selective emitter solar cell processing using a novel screen-printable phosphorus paste. The carrier lifetime of CZ p-type wafers were increased to up to 350μs from an initial lifetime of 195μs and up to 10-fold carrier lifetime improvements were observed for mc-Si p-type wafers. Selective emitter structures on CZ-Si p-type wafers were fabricated by a single screen-printed diffusion process using two simple steps: a single screen-printing of phosphorous paste and an optimized single diffusion process. Highly doped regions under the printed fingers and lowly doped regions between the fingers were realized by phosphorus atoms being diffused out of the printed paste via ambient gas. After optimization of the screen-printed selective emitter, this diffusion process was applied to industrial-type large-area monocrystalline solar cells. A conversion cell efficiency of 18.1% was realized with a fill factor of 79.2%.

Abstract: Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. The pathogenesis of CM is complex. Cerebral metabolic dysfunction is implicated in CM, which may be caused by both an impaired cerebral microcirculation and a dysregulated inflammatory response affecting cellular respiration of mitochondria. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) is a promising new therapy that has been shown to reduce mortality in a mouse model of CM. In order to further elucidate the metabolic dysfunction in CM the objective of the present study was to assess brain mitochondrial respiratory function in CM with and without rhEPO treatment. The P. berghei ANKA – C57BL/6 murine model of CM was used. Mitochondrial respiration was analyzed in brain homogenates using high-resolution respirometry and a multiple substrate and inhibitor protocol. The animals were divided into four groups; infected injected with saline or with rhEPO, non-infected injected with saline or with rhEPO. Infected mice developed CM and treatment with rhEPO attenuated clinical signs of disease. There were no differences in respiratory parameters of brain mitochondria between infected and non-infected mice and no connection between disease severity and mitochondrial respiratory function. Treatment with rhEPO similarly had no effect on respiratory function. Thus cerebral metabolic dysfunction in CM does not seem to be directly linked to altered mitochondrial respiratory capacity as analyzed in brain homogenates ex vivo. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

Abstract: Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), as a key branchpoint of the mevalonate pathway, catalyzes the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates. The isoprenoid intermediates are needed for protein isoprenylation to participate in cardiac remodeling. We have previously demonstrated that both knockdown of FPPS with small interfering RNA and inhibition of FPPS by alendronate could prevent Ang II-induced hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes. In this study, we evaluated the effects of FPPS inhibition in Ang II-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in vivo. Wild type mice were separately treated with saline, Ang II (2.88mg/kg per day), FPPS inhibitor alendronate (0.1mg/kg per day), or the combination of Ang II (2.88mg/kg per day) and alendronate (0.1mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks. The results showed that Ang II increased FPPS expression, and the increases of Ang II-induced synthesis of the isoprenoid intermediates, FPP and GGPP, were significantly inhibited by FPPS inhibitor. In the meantime, FPPS inhibition attenuated Ang II-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis as indexed by the heart weight to body weight ratio, echocardiographic parameters, histological examinations and expression of ANP and BNP mRNA. Furthermore, it was also found that FPPS inhibitor attenuated Ang II-induced increases of RhoA activity and p-38 MAPK phosphorylation and TGF-β1 mRNA expression. In conclusion, FPPS might play an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in vivo, at least in part through RhoA, p-38 MAPK and TGF-β1.

Abstract: In order to improve the stability of organic solar cells based on CuPc/C60 planar heterojunction, an ultra-thin layer of Au (∼2nm) is inserted between CuPc and PEDOT:PSS. Although, short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of the device containing Au layer are less than those of the Au-free one, it has comparable power conversion efficiency (ηp) owing to its higher fill factor (FF). In addition, this ultra-thin Au layer enhances the stability of the device significantly. After a month under ambient condition, the device with “indium thin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/Au” anode reaches 67% of its initial ηp value, while the ηp of the cell with “ITO/PEDOT:PSS” anode drops to less than half of its initial value. The improvement in stability is ascribed to the more durable Au/CuPc interface in contrast to the PEDOT:PSS/CuPc interface.

Abstract: Tubulointerstitial inflammation plays a key role in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Cytokines in the IL-1 family are the key pro-inflammatory cytokines of tubulointerstitial inflammation. Extracellular ATP can cause P2X receptors to activate the NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and cause IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and release. We investigated the role of ATP-P2X4 signaling in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and renal interstitial inflammation characteristic of DN. Ex vivo studies, P2X4 showed increased expression in renal tubule epithelial cells in patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes compared to those in the control group. Linear correlation analysis shows that P2X4 expression was positively related with urine IL-1β and IL-18 levels. Moreover, P2X4 expression was co-localized with NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 expression. In vitro culture experiments showed NLRP3 protein expression, cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β, and release of IL-1β, IL-18 and ATP in HK-2 cells significantly increased after high glucose stimulation. However, apyrase, which consumes extracellular ATP, completely blocked the changes caused by high glucose. The P2 receptor antagonist suramin, P2X receptor antagonist TNP-ATP, P2X4 selective antagonist 5-BDBD, and P2X4 gene silencing attenuated NLRP3 expression, cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β, and release of IL-1β and IL-18 induced by high glucose. Taken together, these results suggest that ATP-P2X4 signaling mediates high glucose-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, regulates IL-1 family cytokine secretion, and causes the development of tubulointerstitial inflammation in DN.

Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is prone to appearing regional lymph node and distant metastasis. And its underlying mechanism is unclear. Recent study suggests that overexpression of metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) was independently associated with poorer distant metastasis-free survival in NPC. However, it is still lack of direct evidence that MTA1 is responsible for aggressive phenotypes of NPC. Using stably transfected MTA1 knockdown or overexpression cells, we discovered the function of MTA1 in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and metastasis processing of NPC in this study. For the first time, our data demonstrate two tumor relevant molecular mechanisms, i.e. Rho GTPases and Hedgehog signaling both contribute to the effect of MTA1 on the aggressive phenotypes of NPC cells. In summary, the novel findings in this work provide further insight into the function of MTA1 and the molecular mechanism in the progression of NPC. Our results indicate that MTA1 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for advanced NPC.

Abstract: A description of the synthesis procedure is provided for a new squaraine molecule, DiPSQ(OH)2. This molecule is an interesting target molecule for organic photovoltaics (OPV) because of its unusually broad panchromaticity, suggesting a tighter molecular packing than would be expected, given its bulky alkyl side groups. UV–vis–NIR absorption data provides evidence for the presence of both H- and J-aggregates. Thin film X-ray diffraction (TFXRD) data supports the presence of one dominant crystal structure. Further interpretation of TFXRD results and complementary Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) characterization for pure and blended samples provides a comprehensive explanation of how DiPSQ(OH)2 aggregates are affected by annealing and crystal growth. The described aggregation properties of donor–acceptor blends for solar cells are strongly dependent on annealing. Influencing phase separation, local crystallinity, and macroscopic crystallization, these physical properties are known to significantly impact charge dissociation, exciton diffusion rates, and bulk charge transport in devices. The strategy of systematically varying annealing times has resulted in improved bulk heterojunction crystallinity and regions of increased phase separation, both necessary to achieve the long term goal of morphological control for commercially viable NIR-active OPV devices.

Abstract: The lifetime of organic solar cells is a critical point limiting their marketability. To extend this lifetime, these devices rely on ultra-barrier materials to prevent their oxidation by oxygen and moisture. Production costs of this barrier material should nevertheless remain in accordance with the low price of the devices. The aim of this work is the development of a multilayer gas barrier material adapted to the device requirements, relying on low cost wet processes. Oxygen and water vapor permeability of organic/inorganic multilayer materials obtained on polymer substrates has been studied. In this paper we also demonstrate that fast helium permeability measurements may be used to screen water barrier performances of thin inorganic layers on polymers in a short time span. Different multilayer composite structures were tested. The potential of such materials as encapsulation material for organic solar cells has been investigated. We demonstrate in this paper that a few layers with a minimum of process steps are sufficient to enhance the stability of P3HT:PCBM organic solar cells under illumination, limiting the efficiency loss to about 10% over 450h.

Abstract: Availability of thermal energy storage systems (TES) is a key to ensuring continuous power supply from solar thermal power plants. The application of sensible heat storage (SHS) in solid media is an attractive economic option, but is dependent on identifying suitable SHS media. Given the growing number of new materials available today, finding a suitable material is a time-consuming and difficult process. This paper demonstrates the use of a materials selection software package and identifies suitable SHS materials for high temperature (>500°C) TES systems. The environmental performance of some selected materials was also evaluated using the package. Common materials such as alumina, silicon carbide, high temperature concrete, graphite, cast iron and steel were found to be highly suitable for SHS for the duty considered (500–750°C). For cost comparison, a simple heat exchanger, consisting of a packed bed of the materials (in brick or block form) heated by an inert gas, was considered. On the basis of equivalent gas phase heat transfer, high alumina cement concrete blocks had the lowest cost, followed by a common refractory brick at <US$ 10/kWh (thermal). High temperature concretes, such as the high alumina cement-based materials and alumina–silicate geoploymers, were identified as having potential for SHS media as they are cheap composite materials. Their thermo–physical properties could be optimised for SHS by a suitable choice of aggregates, binders and additives.

Abstract: A total of 16 analytical methods, spanning from classical solvent extraction over different thermo-analytic and mechanical approaches to acoustic and optical spectroscopy, have been evaluated as to their ability to determine the crosslinking state of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), the prevailing encapsulant for photovoltaics applications. The key objective of this work was to create a systematic and comprehensive comparison, using a unified set of traceable test samples covering the full range of realistically occurring degrees of EVA crosslinking. A majority number of these tested methods proved fundamentally suitable for detecting changes in the polymer properties during crosslinking based on the effect e.g. its mechanical properties or its crystallinity. Interestingly, when investigated in detail, most of the methods showed mutually different dependencies on the lamination time, indicating a complex range of effects of the chemical crosslinking on the properties and behaviour of the material. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy could be identified as a potential new method for measuring the degree of crosslinking in-line in the PV module manufacturing process, thus providing an interesting approach for improving process control in PV module processing.

Glutathionylation of recombinant Prdx6 mediated by π glutathione S-transferase (GST) is required for reduction of the oxidized Cys and completion of the peroxidatic catalytic cycle in vitro. This study investigated the requirement for πGST in intact cells. Transfection with a plasmid construct expressing πGST into MCF7, a cell line that lacks endogenous πGST, significantly increased phospholipid peroxidase activity as measured in cell lysates and protected intact cells against a peroxidative stress. siRNA knockdown indicated that this increased peroxidase activity was Prdx6 dependent. Interaction between πGST and Prdx6, evaluated by the Duolink Proximity Ligation Assay, was minimal under basal conditions but increased dramatically following treatment of cells with the oxidant, tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Interaction was abolished by mutation of C47, the active site for Prdx6 peroxidase activity. Depletion of cellular GSH by treatment of cells with buthionine sulfoximine had no effect on the interaction of Prdx6 and πGST. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation of the catalytic cysteine in Prdx6 is required for its interaction with πGST and that the interaction plays an important role in regenerating the peroxidase activity of Prdx6.

Abstract: Luminescent solar concentrators are low cost photovoltaic devices, which reduce the amount of necessary semiconductor material per unit area of a solar collector by means of concentration. The device is comprised a thin plastic plate in which luminescent species (fluorophores) have been incorporated. The fluorophores absorb the solar light and radiatively re-emit part of the energy. Total internal reflection traps most of the emitted light inside the plate and wave-guides it to a narrow side facet with a solar cell attached, where conversion into electricity occurs. The efficiency of such devices is as yet rather low, due to several loss mechanisms, of which self-absorption is of high importance. This work demonstrates that type-II semiconductor hetero-nanocrystals may offer a solution to the self-absorption problem in luminescent solar concentrators.

Abstract: The eigenfunctions and the interband photon absorption of a solar quantum well solar cell are calculated using the K.p Empirical Hamiltonian developed for quantum dot solar cells. The calculations are compared with the measured quantum efficiency in a prototype quantum well solar cell. The agreement is reasonably good. The absorption with quantum wells is found to be much greater than with quantum dots. This is due, besides the higher number of states, to the partially extended nature of quantum well wavefunctions that leads to photon matrix elements which are substantially different to those applicable to quantumdots.

Abstract: Diseases of the mitochondria generally affect cells with high-energy demand, and appear to most profoundly affect excitatory cells that have localized high energy requirements, such as neurons and cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Complex I of the mammalian mitochondrial respiratory chain is a very large, 45 subunit enzyme, and functional deficiency of complex I is the most frequently observed cause of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disorders. Impairment of complex I results in decreased cellular energy production and is responsible for a variety of human encephalopathies, myopathies and cardiomyopathies. Complex I deficiency may be caused by mutations in any of the seven mitochondrial or 38 nuclear genes that encode complex I subunits or by mutations in various other nuclear genes that affect complex I assembly or function. Mouse models that faithfully mimic human complex I disorders are needed to better understand the role of complex I in health and disease and for evaluation of potential therapies for mitochondrial diseases. In this review we discuss existing mouse models of mitochondrial complex I dysfunction, focusing on those with similarities to human mitochondrial disorders. We also discuss some of the noteworthy murine genetic models in which complex I genes are not disrupted, but complex I dysfunction is observed, along with some of the more popular chemical compounds that inhibit complex I function and are useful for modeling complex I deficiency in mice. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

Abstract: To maximise the degree of light incoupling, therefore improving the short circuit current and efficiency of solar cells, a novel subwavelength (SW) structured ‘moth-eye’ antireflection coating (ARC) is formed on the sun-facing side of the glass superstrate. This moth-eye structure in theory can suppress reflection entirely in the 300–1200nm wavelength range. It is produced by fabricating a mask, followed by reactive ion etch. In this paper, we present a novel etch mask, a random Ag nanoparticle array on glass with feature size ranging from ∼50nm to ∼350nm. The subwavelength features can be adjusted by varying the size, shape and distribution of the Ag nanoparticle array, which in turn is tuned by varying as-deposited Ag thickness. The optimal structures reduce reflection loss by a current equivalent of 1.25mA/cm2 for a 3.3mm borosilicate glass (BSG) superstrate, by 1.39mA/cm2 for 1.1mm BSG and enhances Jsc by 3.4% on average for 2.4μm poly-Si thin-film solar cells on 3.3mm BSG. On Si film side of the glass surface, a preliminary modulated texture investigation, consisting of growing SW structure on micron sized aluminium induced textured (AIT) glass reduced reflection loss by ∼7% compared to original AIT samples.

Abstract: Titanium oxide (TiOx) was introduced as an electron selective layer between the active layer and bottom electrode in inverted organic solar cells with graphene oxide (GO) an anode interfacial layer. The device with TiOx exhibited a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency compared to that without TiOx, which indicates that TiOx efficiently blocked holes at the active/bottom layer. This device exhibits good stability over 2160h of storage with only 3.67% reduction in efficiency. The dependence of the device performances on TiOx film thickness was also investigated.

Abstract: The long-term stability of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) based on an amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer, CYC-B6L was studied. When the surface of the TiO2 electrode was passivated with a co-adsorbent, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the resulting DSC reveals very good long-term stability with over 87% of initial performance under a 1000h prolonged light-irradiation and thermal stress (60°C) aging, which is as good as the state-of-the art robust device. The solvent used in dye bath also affects the long-term stability of the DSC devices. The effect of co-adsorbent and the impact of the dye bath solvents on the device durability were investigated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Abstract: Many degradation mechanisms in organic solar cells are underpinned by the ingress of water at certain points. We demonstrate the use of a photocurrent mapping technique to examine the diffusive ingress of water at the edges of a cell and at pinholes in the cathode layer. A diffusion model applied to the experimental results leads to a value of (5.0±2.7)×10−6cm2s−1 for the diffusivity of water in the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulphonate) layer. The existence of this layer increases the rate of cell degradation by a factor of ten. The literature is inconclusive with respect to which entry pathway for water is the most important. We find that (a) water ingress clearly occurs at pinholes and at the device edges, rather than uniformly through the cathode film; (b) that ingress at pinholes has the same time dependence as ingress at the edges, however the absolute rate depends on the size of the pinhole; and (c) that degradation at the device edges is faster than even at larger pinholes, except where the cathode layer extends beyond the boundary of the active cell. It follows that the lateral architecture of the cell can significantly impact the degradation of efficiency in the device, and we quantify this effect. We demonstrate that the photocurrent mapping method does not require complete local annihilation of device performance in order to track the ingress of water, which means that the method may also be valuable for the study of water ingress through encapsulants in commercial or near-commercial devices.

Abstract: Human serum has the potential for mesenchymal progenitor cell recruitment in repair of articular cartilage lesions. It is unclear which factor(s) in serum mediate this migratory effect. Our goal was to identify cell recruiting factors in human serum fractions obtained by ion exchange chromatography. The recruiting activity of serum fractions on human subchondral mesenchymal progenitor cells was analyzed using 96-well chemotaxis assays. Protein composition of recruiting serum fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry and showed 58 potential candidates. Fibronectin, gelsolin, lumican, thrombospondin-1 and WNT-9a were identified as key candidates for progenitor cell recruitment. Only human plasma derived and recombinant fibronectin showed significant recruiting activity on progenitors reaching 50–90% of the recruiting activity of normal human serum. Presence of fibronectin in all human serum fractions with recruiting activity was verified by Western blot analysis. This study shows that fibronectin is a key factor in human serum to recruit mesenchymal progenitor cells and might be involved in subchondral mesenchymal progenitor cell migration into cartilage defects after microfracture.

Abstract: The superior transport and lifetime properties of Cu-rich chalcopyrite semiconductors are discussed. The reason why solar cells are made from Cu-poor absorbers in spite of their inferior properties is the CdS/absorber interface which leads to high recombination in the case of Cu-rich absorbers. We report on Cu-rich solar cells with a Cu-poor surface, which have reached 13.1% efficiency.

Abstract: We report on the electrochromic properties of transparent one-dimensional nickel oxide (NiO) nanorods grown in a high-density and large-area array. The NiO nanorod array was synthesized on a conducting indium tin oxide thin film via hot-filament metal-oxide vapor deposition (HFMOVD). The array contained ∼100 nanorods per square micrometer, which were ∼500nm long and ∼100nm wide. XRD analysis revealed the 1D NiO nanorods to be in cubic crystalline form within space group Fm3¯m . The outstanding electrochromic properties, including the stable and reversible coloration–bleaching cycles, and large diffusion coefficient (∼6.33×10−8cm2/s), as well as good coloration efficiency (43.3cm2/C), great optical transmittance difference (60%), high optical density (1.06), and very fast coloration and bleaching times (1.55 and 1.22s) at a wavelength of 630nm, make the NiO nanorods excellent materials for use in smart windows.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the effects of a wet chemical etch-back process and the porous Si that is formed during the etch-back process on the optical and electrical performances of a selective emitter solar cell. In this paper, we assert that the sheet resistance of the emitter after the etch-back process could be controlled by monitoring the reflectivity of the porous Si at 500nm. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs of the porous Si reveal that the thickness of the porous Si is not entirely homogenous, gradually decreasing from the top of the pyramid to the valley. The etch-back process results in pyramid morphology variations that increase the reflectivity of the texture. After removing the porous Si, the minority carrier lifetime of the emitter increases significantly. Because of this effect, the conversion efficiency of the SE solar cell is 0.27% higher than that of the regular homogenous emitter solar cells. Although this approach increases the texture reflectivity, the etch-back process greatly improves the internal quantum efficiency in the short wavelength range, which in turn increases the short-circuit current density by a large amount. The calculated Jsc shows that the peak gain of the short-circuit current density occurs at approximately 400nm.

Abstract: III–V monolithic multi-junction solar cells reach efficiencies exceeding 40% and have applications in space and terrestrial concentrator systems. Due to the series connection of the junctions, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement of multi-junction cells presents additional challenges compared to EQE measurement procedures for single-junction devices. Previous work has shown that optimization of bias light and voltage is necessary to minimize measurement artifacts that usually appear during the measurement of the Germanium (Ge) junctions with low shunt resistance. This paper aims to contribute to the improvement of multi-junction device characterization by reporting the effects of low and high shunt resistance junctions on EQE for various voltage and light bias conditions. Voltage and light bias are shown to have different effects on junctions with different shunt resistance. Therefore further investigation of junctions with different shunt resistance under variable light and voltage conditions is needed to provide better understanding of the precise test conditions for EQE measurements. Our results showed that in the high shunt resistance junctions the bias voltage technique is not necessary. However, in the case of junctions with low shunt resistance, a combination of voltage and light bias is required during EQE measurements. Furthermore, the luminescence coupling effect was observed during EQE measurements at very intense light bias conditions confirming previous indications. Finally, an alternative approach for measuring the EQE is proposed.

Abstract: Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 4 (STEAP4) plays a critical role in modulating inflammatory response and protecting metabolic function. However, the role of STEAP4 in hepatocytes is not well understood, and the mechanism of STEAP4 action remains elusive. Here, we report the molecular characterization of porcine STEAP4 and its novel splice variant (STEAP4v), then the metabolic and anti-inflammatory roles of porcine STEAP4 and STEAP4v were investigated in HepG2 liver cells. The results revealed that overexpression of STEAP4, but not STEAP4v, suppresses triglyceride (TG) content and ameliorates the up-regulation of the transcription of the genes necessary for de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis elicited by FFAs treatment. In RAW264.7 macrophage cells, transient transfection of STEAP4v, to a greater extent than STEAP4, repressed the transcription of TNFα and IL-6. In HepG2 cells with LPS treatment, the endogenous mRNA and protein levels of STEAP4 and STEAP4v were up-regulated, which was accompanied by a concurrent increase in C/EBPβ mRNA and protein levels. Thirdly, the functional regulation of STEAP4 was explored, which revealed that the porcine STEAP4 promoter activity was significantly up-regulated by C/EBPβ. The progressive deletions and mutations demonstrated that the C/EBPβ binding motif situated at −73/−59bp is an essential component required for promoter activity of STEAP4 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays determined that C/EBPβ can directly interact with the steap4 promoter DNA. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that C/EBPβ directly regulates the roles of STEAP4 and its novel variant in attenuating lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis or/and inflammation elicited by FFAs or LPS in hepatocytes.

Abstract: The apoptosis pathway has been proposed to be involved in causing neuronal cell death in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. However, the details of this pathway are poorly understood. Previous research has shown increased acetylcholinesterase expression during apoptosis in various cell types, which suggests that acetylcholinesterase has a potential role in neuronal cell death. In this study, we found that acetylcholinesterase protein expression increased and caspase-3 was activated in PC12 cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. Furthermore, the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of acetylcholinesterase was shown to protect PC12 cells from MPP+ induced apoptotic cell death. To study the function of acetylcholinesterase as a mechanism of neuronal cell death in vivo, we subsequently established a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine Parkinson's disease mouse model utilizing acetylcholinesterase-deficient mice. Studies in these mice revealed reduced dopaminergic neuron loss and lower expression levels of apoptotic proteins in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated heterozygous mice compared to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated wild-type mice. We conclude that it is highly probable that acetylcholinesterase is involved in the pathogenesis of the neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease via apoptosis. Specifically, a deficiency or inhibition of acetylcholinesterase can decrease apoptosis and protect dopaminergic neurons in the neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Human Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a receptor for a variety of microbial products and mediates activation signals in cells of the innate immune system. Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of TLR2. In this study, using real-time PCR and western blot assays, we show that trichostatin A (TSA), which is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, upregulates the expression of both TLR2 mRNA and protein in the human THP-1 cell line. A luciferase activity analysis of the truncated TLR2 promoter indicated that the region from −230 to −140 in the TLR2 promoter was sensitive to TSA. Moreover, using electrophoresis mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we identified an AP-2 alpha (AP-2α) responsive element at position −184 and found that the binding of AP-2α to this element was enhanced by TSA under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses showed that the levels of acetylated AP-2α were increased in THP-1 cells after TSA treatment, and this increase is consistent with the increased binding affinity to the AP-2α responsive elements. In summary, these data define a mechanism through which AP-2α acetylation and increased promoter access induce the expression of the TLR2 gene. This mechanism may provide insight into a regulatory mode of TLR2 expression and the molecular foundations of certain immunological diseases.

Abstract: Clusterin is a stress-responsive and highly glycosylated secretory protein that plays cytoprotective role in most body fluids. In addition to extracellular clusterin, several intracellular clusterin variants that are rather cytotoxic have been recently uncovered under diverse pathological conditions. Although these variants revealed heterogeneity in their glycan modification, its significance in many diseases remains to be validated. Here, we found that clusterin is differentially metabolized by two well-characterized ER stress inducers. Thapsigargin induced retrotranslocation and rapid degradation of clusterin from the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas tunicamycin failed to degrade but rather retained clusterin in the endoplasmic reticulum. Important sorting determinant for these processes proved to be N-glycan moieties that are required for the prevention of terminal misfolding and aggregation of clusterin in the endoplasmic reticulum. This study provides a mechanistic insight into the generation of noble cytotoxic variant of intracellular clusterin and an idea about molecular pathogenesis of diseases associated with chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress, such as neurodegeneration.

Abstract: TISS paints are complex multi-phase systems consisting of large Al flakes (>50μm) and small inorganic oxide pigment (<500nm), embedded in a resin. The large difference between the metallic and inorganic oxide pigment particles poses a problem for paint application in a well reproducible manner, necessary for attaining the highest difference between the solar absorptance and thermal emittance values (i.e., spectral selectivity) of the applied coatings. Due to the complex paint flow through the spray gun nozzle, adjustment of the deposition parameters can be correct only by knowing the detailed rheological properties of the paint, combined with a trial-and-error process. In the present work, we studied the rheological properties of TISS paints and their effect on the spectral selectivity of dry coatings, which were applied on the substrate with the spraying application method. The final aim of our study was to determine the influence of spraying parameters (nozzle, spray gun pressure, and speed of substrate) on the selectivity and to establish the phenomenon of pigment distribution and flake orientation during spraying application.

And the new NDT-based polymers (PNDTTT-C and PNDTTT-CF) with thienothiophene units were synthesized. The polymers showed deep HOMO levels of −5.44eV and −5.51eV with the optical band gap of ∼1.6eV. The electrochemical as well as optical and photovoltaic properties of these polymers were studied. The OPV devices fabricated from the blends of polymer PNDTTT-C/PNDTTT-CF: PC71BM were afforded a high power conversion efficiency of 4.49% and 5.16%, respectively. The optimization of device fabrication included different solvents, different weight ratios and usage of solvent processing additive. To obtain the high PCE a typical processing additive 1,8-diiodooctane was used. The effect of processing additive was studied using AFM analysis. In addition, the field-effect hole mobilities of 3.5×10−4cm2V−1s−1 and 5.7×10−4cm2V−1s−1 were observed for the polymers PNDTTT-C and PNDTTT-CF, respectively. Since we have developed the synthetic process of the 3,8-bis(2-butyloctyloxy)- naphtho[3,2-b:7,6-b′]dithiophene(NDT) monomer, the NDT unit will play an important role in future research on conjugated polymer and small molecule design for high-performance organic semiconducting material.

Abstract: Sialyltransferases have received much attention recently as they are frequently up-regulated in cancer cells. However, the role played by each sialyltransferase in tumour progression is still unknown. α2,3-Sialyltransferases ST3Gal III and ST3Gal IV are involved in sialyl-Lewisx (SLex) synthesis. Given that the role of ST3Gal III in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells has been previously reported, in this study we have focused on investigating the role of ST3Gal IV in the acquisition of adhesive, migratory and metastatic capabilities and, secondly, in analyzing the expression of ST3Gal III and ST3Gal IV in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues versus control tissues. ST3Gal IV overexpressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma MDAPanc-28 cell lines were generated. They showed a heterogeneous increase in SLex, and enhanced E-selectin adhesion and migration. Furthermore, when injected into nude mice, increased metastasis and decreased survival were found in comparison with controls. The behaviour of MDAPanc-28 ST3Gal IV overexpressing cells in these processes was similar to the already reported MDAPanc-28 ST3Gal III overexpressing cells. Furthermore, pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues tended to express high levels of ST3Gal III and ST3Gal IV together with other fucosyltransferase genes FUT3 and FUT6, all involved in the last steps of sialyl-Lewisx biosynthesis. In conclusion, both α2,3-sialyltransferases are involved in key steps of pancreatic tumour progression processes and are highly expressed in most pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues.

Abstract: A novel donor–acceptor (D–A) donor molecule, 1, comprising of two di-p-tolylamino donors and a dicyanovinylene acceptor bridged by a planar and rigid fluorene moiety has been synthesized and characterized. The molecular structure and crystal packing of 1 was characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Such molecular configuration endowed 1 with an efficient D–A interaction, rendering an intense ICT absorption band for efficiently light-harvesting and retain low-lying HOMO for generating sufficient open-circuit voltage (Voc). The vacuum-deposited hybrid planar-mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) photovoltaic devices utilizing 1 as donor and C70 as acceptor to achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.04 and 5.31% for the single- and tandem-cell photovoltaic devices under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100mWcm−2).

Abstract: Tungsten-oxide-based electrochromic (EC) windows are currently the most robust and matured dynamic windows where the transmittance of visual light and near-infrared radiation can be controlled by a small applied voltage. In its standard application, the window is commonly either in its clear or colored state. In this contribution, we study the optical and energy performance of such window in the fully bleached and fully colored state as well as when it is kept in intermediate states. Different configurations in terms of placement of the EC layer stack and possible additional low-emissivity (low-E) coating within the insulated glass unit are considered. Using optical data and software tools we find that even a small coloration has a significant effect on the energy performance because the solar heat gain coefficient is readily reduced by the absorption of the EC layer stack. We compare the performance of the EC windows to commercially available solar-control (spectrally selective) low-E windows.

Interactions of the ubiquitous octamer-binding transcription factor-1 with both the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and the glucocorticoid receptor mediate prolactin and glucocorticoid-induced β-casein gene expression in mammary epithelial cells,

Abstract: Regulation of milk protein gene expression by lactogenic hormones (prolactin and glucocorticoids) provides an attractive model for studying the mechanisms by which protein and steroid hormones synergistically regulate gene expression. β-Casein is one of the major milk proteins and its expression in mammary epithelial cells is stimulated by lactogenic hormones. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and glucocorticoid receptor are essential downstream mediators of prolactin and glucocorticoid signaling, respectively. Previous studies have shown that mutating the octamer-binding site of the β-casein gene proximal promoter dramatically reduces the hormonal induction of the promoter activity. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this report, we show that lactogenic hormones rapidly induce the binding of octamer-binding transcription factor-1 to the β-casein promoter and this induction is not mediated by either increasing the expression of octamer-binding transcription factor-1 or inducing its translocation to the nucleus. Rather, lactogenic hormones induce physical interactions between the octamer-binding transcription factor-1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, and glucocorticoid receptor to form a ternary complex, and these interactions enhance or stabilize the binding of these transcription factors to the promoter. Abolishing these interactions significantly reduces the hormonal induction of β-casein gene transcription. Thus, our study indicates that octamer-binding transcription factor-1 may serve as a master regulator that facilitates the DNA binding of both signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and glucocorticoid receptor in hormone-induced β-casein expression, and defines a novel mechanism of regulation of tissue-specific gene expression by the ubiquitous octamer-binding transcription factor-1.

Abstract: Chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) is a member of C-C chemokine superfamily that contributes to inflammatory and fibrotic process. Studies in patients and experimental animals provide compelling evidence that increased CCL2 expression plays an important role in the development of fibroproliferative lung disease. The up-regulated CCL2 expression in pulmonary fibrosis is also involved in the potent profibrotic effects that thrombin exerts during lung injury. Here, we investigated the transcriptional mechanism involved in CCL2 production by thrombin in human primary lung fibroblasts and explored the transcriptional mechanism of increased CCL2 expression in pulmonary fibrosis. Thrombin increased CCL2 mRNA levels but not mRNA stability, suggesting it was acting transcriptionally. The increased binding of transcription factors to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) elements in the CCL2 promoter contributed to active transcription following thrombin stimulation. Primary human lung fibroblasts isolated from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) produced significantly higher levels of CCL2 than nonfibrotic lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays detected increased binding of NF-κB p65 and AP-1 subunit c-Jun to the CCL2 promoter of IPF cells both in the presence and absence of thrombin stimulation. The significantly increased binding of p65 and c-Jun to the CCL2 promoter was also observed in the lung tissue of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis murine model. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that the increased binding of transcription factors to NF-κB and AP-1 elements in the CCL2 promoter is responsible for the active transcription expression of CCL2 in pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: We performed a comprehensive study on the electrochromism in TiO2 thin films made by reactive DC magnetron sputtering and elucidated the roles of sputter gas pressure p, O2/Ar gas ratio γ and substrate temperature τs. Good mid-luminous optical modulation—taken to be ∼50% in ∼200-nm-thick films—was obtained under charge exchange in a Li+ electrolyte for p>15mTorr and τs<100°C, whereas γ was less important. The deposition rate dropped for increasing p, and hence p≈15mTorr was optimal. These films were X-ray amorphous and contained some water. The coloration efficiency η was ∼25cm2/C, which exceeds data on η in most prior studies on sputter deposited TiO2 and verifies that such films can display the same values of η as those of TiO2 films made by several chemical techniques.

Abstract: Amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide (a-SiC:H) multilayers consisting of nm-thin, alternating Si-rich Si1−xCx and stoichiometric SiC layers were prepared using plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. Such multilayers are possible precursor layers for forming Si nanocrystals (NCs) for Si-based tandem solar cells. The multilayers were annealed at temperatures up to 1000°C for 30min and the crystallization of Si NCs in a SiC matrix was investigated. The annealing temperature affected the nanostructure of the multilayers and was studied using various techniques: by scanning electron microscopy we observed that the total thickness of the multilayers was reduced during annealing by 30%. X-ray diffraction revealed the crystallization of Si and SiC NCs when annealing temperatures exceeded 900°C. The crystal structure and the nanostructure were investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) bright-field imaging, high resolution TEM and electron diffraction. By electron diffraction it was proved that SiC crystallized in the cubic polytype 3C-SiC during the annealing process. Energy-filtered TEM showed a roughening of the multilayer structure when crystalline phases were formed. Aberration-corrected high-resolution images yielded lattice fringe images of the SiC and Si NCs. The size of the NCs was 5nm for Si and 2nm for SiC. Raman spectroscopy and electron diffraction showed that a large fraction of Si was still amorphous after annealing at 900°C. Annealing at 1000°C reduced the fraction of the amorphous phase by ∼35% for Si and ∼25% for SiC and strongly affected the crystalline perfection of the NCs and also the integrity of the layers. In contrast to Si NCs in a SiO2 matrix, Si NCs in a SiC matrix did not yield significant photoluminescence possible reasons will be discussed.

Abstract: During quantum dot (QD) growth, substrate misorientation has been shown to play a role in the QD growth mechanism, changing their size, shape and density. Since various misorientation angles are used in production of solar cells, this work investigates QD enhanced GaAs p-i-n solar cells grown using the Stranski–Krastanov (SK) growth method on substrates misoriented either 2° or 6° off the (100) in the [11¯0] direction. Results of this work show that 2° misoriented samples have a lower critical thickness for InAs QD formation as compared to the 6° misorientation: ∼1.7 monolayers (ML) versus∼1.8ML, respectively. In addition, the 6° substrates showed a more uniform QD density and size distribution of QDs without significant QD coalescence. Photoluminescence of both substrate types shows that the QD ground state transitions are similar in wavelength. Results of the solar cells under one sun illumination show that QD cells grown on both 2° and 6° substrates have higher short-circuit current density than comparable cells without QD and maintain a high open-circuit voltage. The QD contributed short-circuit current density was normalized for QD size and density for both the 2° and 6° samples. Values of 360A/cm2 per cm3 of InAs and 400A/cm2 per cm3 of InAs were found for the 2° and 6° samples, respectively. For both substrate types, the reduced number of coalesced QDs promoted effective strain balancing, while the increased QD density lead to strong QD absorption.

Abstract: Creatine kinase plays a key role in the energy homeostasis of vertebrate cells. Creatine kinase B (CKB), a cytosolic isoform of creatine kinase, shows upregulated expression in a variety of cancers. In this research, we confirmed that some ovarian cancer tissues had elevated CKB expression at the protein level. The functions of CKB in ovarian cancer progression were investigated in the ovarian cancer cell line Skov3, which has a high CKB expression. It was found that CKB knockdown inhibited Skov3 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis under hypoxia or hypoglycemia conditions. CKB depletion also sensitized Skov3 to chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, the CKB knockdown reduced glucose consumption and lactate production, and increased ROS production and oxygen consumption. This suggested that CKB knockdown decreased cytosolic glycolysis and resulted in a tumor suppressive metabolic state in Skov3 cells. Consequently, we found that the knockdown of CKB induced G2 arrest in cell cycle by elevating p21 expression and affected the PI3K/Akt and AMPK pathways. These findings provide new insights in the role of CKB in cancer cell survival and tumor progression. Our results also suggest that CKB depletion/inhibition in combination with chemotherapeutic agents might have synergistic effects in ovarian cancer therapy.

Abstract: The Notch signaling system features a growing number of modulators that include extracellular proteins that bind to the Notch ectodomain. Collagens are a complex, heterogeneous family of secreted proteins that serve both structural and signaling functions, most prominently through binding to integrins and DDR. The shared widespread tissue distribution of Notch and collagen prompted us to investigate the effects of collagen on Notch signaling. In a cell co-culture signaling assay, we found that type IV collagen inhibited Notch signaling in H460 and A7R5 cell lines. Moreover, Notch-stimulated expression of mature smooth muscle genes SMA, MHC, SM22, and calponin, which define the physiologic phenotype of normal vascular smooth muscle, was inhibited by type IV collagen in A7R5 cells. Cloned promoters of three of these genes were also inhibited by exposure to collagen. Collagen-dependent repression of Notch signaling required an RBP-jK site within the SM22 promoter. Moreover, repression by collagen required extracellular stimulation of the Notch signaling pathway. Type IV collagen bound to both Notch3 and Jagged1 proteins in purified protein binding assays. In addition, type I collagen also inhibited Notch signaling and bound to Notch and Jagged. We conclude that type IV and type I collagen repress canonical Notch signaling to alter expression of Notch target genes.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma (NB) is characterized by pleomorphic molecular characteristics, which may influence cellular metabolism as well as the efficacy of glycolytic inhibitors in suppressing NB cell growth. We studied the metabolic profile of four NB cell lines without or with MYCN amplification and found no unanimous metabolic characteristics. The two NB cell lines with MYCN amplification exhibited a significantly higher HIF-1α expression level and ATP content compared to the two cell lines without MYCN amplification. MYCN amplification was associated with significantly greater inhibition of cellular proliferation and more apoptosis after treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). Further analysis showed that 2DG increased PDK1 but decreased the ATP content and increased expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bad in both SK-N-AS (without MYCN amplification) and SK-N-DZ (with MYCN amplification) cells. In addition, 2DG decreased hexokinase II expression in SK-N-DZ cells and increased HIF-1α, Noxa, and PUMA expression in SK-N-AS cells. Pretreating SK-N-DZ cells with 2DG or cisplatin for 24h, followed by cisplatin or 2DG for another 24h, resulted in significantly greater suppression of cellular proliferation compared to treatment with 2DG or cisplatin for 48h alone. Effective suppression of SK-N-AS proliferation occurred only when the cells were pretreated with cisplatin. Pretreatment of SK-N-DZ, but not SK-N-AS, with 2DG followed by the BH3-only mimetic ABT737 also resulted in significantly greater suppression of cellular proliferation compared to treatment with ABT737 or 2DG alone. A low dose of 2DG (2mM) was as effective as a high dose (20mM) in SK-N-DZ cells. In conclusion, the glycolytic inhibitor 2DG complemented the cisplatin- or ABT737-induced suppression of growth in NB cells, which are sensitive to glycolytic inhibition.

Abstract: Resident myogenic stem cells, satellite cells, up-regulate a secreted multi-functional modulator, semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), exclusively at the early-differentiation phase in response to muscle-crush injury and treatment with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). Here, we add evidence that the Sema3A expression and secretion induced by the growth factors is significantly higher in primary cultures from adult rat soleus than from the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. The higher Sema3A response, revealed by quantitative PCR and Western blotting of cell lysates and conditioned media, may account for the higher myogenin expression of soleus muscle satellite cells early in differentiation since addition of recombinant Sema3A stimulates myogenin expression in cultures. These experiments also showed that mRNA expression of plexin A2, which together with neuropilins, constitutes Sema3A composite-receptors, was higher in satellite cells from soleus than EDL with no difference in plexin A1 and A3 and neuropilin-1 and 2 levels. These comparative studies, therefore, highlight a possible Sema3A-plexin A2-myogenin signaling axis that may ensure promoting early differentiation by soleus muscle satellite cells.

Abstract: One of the prime objects of organic solar cell research has been to improve the power conversion efficiency. Unfortunately, the accurate determination of this property is not straight forward and has led to the recommendation that record devices be tested and certified at a few accredited laboratories following rigorous ASTM and IEC standards. This work tries to address some of the issues confronting the standard laboratory in this regard. Solar simulator lamps are investigated for their light field homogeneity and direct versus diffuse components, as well as the correct device area determination using various types of masks, are discussed. The main findings are that the light field inhomogeneity and a large diffuse component in combination with masking give rise to a substantial variation in the measured efficiency. As a result the device efficiency can easily be over or underestimated. We offer a set of recommendations for the device masking and efficiency characterization that enable accurate determination of the efficiency in a standard OPV characterization laboratory.

Abstract: Aberrant cell-surface glycosylation patterns are present on tumors and have been linked to tumor progression. This study aimed to identify the alterations of glycogene and N-glycan involved in tumor invasion, tumorigenicity and drug resistance in MHCC97-H and MHCC97-L human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, which have high, low metastatic potential, respectively. Using real-time PCR for quantification of glycogene and FITC-lectin binding for glycan profiling, we found that the expression of glycogenes and glycan profiling were different in MHCC97-H cells, as compared to those in MHCC97-L cells. We silenced the expression levels of glycogenes MGAT3 and MGAT5, which were over-expressed in MHCC97-L and MHCC97-H cells. Knockdown of MGAT3 expression promoted MHCC97-L cells invasion and increased resistance to 5-fluorouracil in vitro. The silencing of MGAT5 in MHCC97-H cells inhibited invasion and increased sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil in vitro. Further analysis of the N-glycan regulation by tunicamycin application or PNGase F treatment in MHCC97-H and MHCC97-L cells showed partial inhibition of N-glycan glycosylation, decreased invasion, tumorigenicity and increased sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that alterations of glycogene and N-glycan in human hepatocarcinoma cells correlate with tumor invasion, tumorigenicity and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug, and have significant implications for the development of treatment strategies.

Abstract: Prototype electrochromic devices (ECDs) based on anodically-colouring thin-film Prussian blue (PB) or Ruthenium purple (RP) and cathodically-colouring aqueous solution-phase di-n-heptyl viologen are described. The initial (‘off’) state of each ECD is set with the PB (or RP) in the colourless reduced form and the di-n-heptyl viologen as the colourless di-cation. Switching the ECDs to the coloured state (‘on’), forms on oxidation the coloured mixed-valence PB (or RP), with simultaneous reduction of the di-n-heptyl viologen di-cation to form the purplish-red di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation dimer salt as a thin film. The overall perceived reversible colour changes were colourless to deep blue/purple for the PB/di-n-heptyl viologen ECDs and colourless to pinkish-purple for the RP/di-n-heptyl viologen ECDs. Using the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) system of colorimetry, the colour stimuli of the ECDs were calculated from in situ visible region spectra recorded under electrochemical control, the depth of colour being controlled by the di-n-heptyl viologen concentration. For the coloured states of the PB/di-n-heptyl viologen ECDs, the CIELAB 1976 colour space coordinates for a D55 illuminant were L⁎=60, a*=22 and b*=−47, and L*=39, a*=47 and b*=−55, respectively for 5 and 10mmoldm−3 di-n-heptyl viologen solution concentrations. For the RP/di-n-heptyl viologen ECDs, the coordinates were L*=70, a*=31 and b*=−27, and L*=63, a*=44 and b*=−34, respectively for 5 and 10mmoldm−3 di-n-heptyl viologen solution concentrations. L* quantifies the lightness, with +a*, −a*, +b* and −b* respectively giving the red, green, yellow and blue directions away from the achromatic point (0, 0).

Abstract: A series of high coplanar alternative copolymers containing benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor unit and alkoxy substituted electron-accepting 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole moiety (PBDT-BT), high coplanar electron-donating thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moiety (PBDT-TT), or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene attached to both sides of the benzothiadiazole moiety (PBDT-TTBTT) were designed and synthesized. The influences of the conjugated moiety on polymer optical and electrochemical properties, phase separation in blend film with (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), and photovoltaic properties for the application as donor materials in polymer photovoltaic cells (PVCs) were studied. The optical and electrochemical properties of copolymers showed that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined by BDT and BT moiety in the alternative copolymers, respectively. The TT moiety does not have significant influence on the energy level when incorporated with BDT and BT units in alternative copolymers, but can significantly affect the phase separation behavior when mixed with PC61BM by improving the crystal structural order. Interestingly, hierarchical lamella structures were observed in the blend film containing copolymer and PC61BM: one is crystalline copolymer’s ordered lamella packing structure with size about 2nm, as revealed by the XRD experiments; the other is the lamella phase separation structure with width about 15nm. The crystal grain size in blend film was estimated by means of Scherrer’s equation, and the value coincided well with that from TEM observation. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated by using the copolymers as donors and PC61BM or (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptors. The results indicate larger crystal domain size will give better power conversion efficiency (PCE) in our system, where the domain size is smaller than the exciton diffusion length (∼20nm). The photovoltaic device based on PBDT-TTBTT:PC71BM showed a Jsc of 9.15mA/cm2 and a PCE of 3.54%.

Abstract: The degradation of the edge regions of crystalline silicon cells after damp-heat tests is a common phenomenon which can be observed in the electroluminescence images of most c-Si PV modules after damp-heat aging. However, the origin of this damp-heat induced degradation effect is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the degradation behavior of laminates with different designs, including laminate types with an open, thus breathable, front-side and two standard designs with one or two layers of EVA in front of the cell, respectively. This way, the influence of permeation properties and possible barrier effects on the degradation of the cell were investigated. The laminates were subjected to damp-heat aging tests at 80% r.h., 80°C and 90°C, respectively, for up to 2500h. Electroluminescence imaging showed degradation after 2000h of damp-heat aging at 90°C for the standard laminate designs. No cell degradation was found for the breathable laminates. Measurements of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) did not reveal a change of the recombination rate, thus the corrosion of the grid is the most likely cause of the degradation. This hypothesis was confirmed by an increased series resistance in the degraded areas. In those areas, aggregates of small needles were observed which could be identified as organic lead compounds by EDX. Since no hints of degradation could be found for the breathable laminates, an impact of the acetic acid as one corrosive degradation product from the encapsulant on the metal corrosion is very likely.

Abstract: We present optical and electrical measurements of bandgap of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H). The absorption coefficient (α) does not yield a linear relation on the Tauc plot, indicating that the concept of the Tauc bandgap is no longer valid. The energy at the absorption coefficient α=104cm−1 increases with crystallinity, but it does not imply that the optical bandgap increases with crystallinity. Instead, it reflects the characteristics of mixed-phase material, where the crystalline phase has lower absorption than the amorphous phase. Dark current versus voltage measurements of nc-Si:H solar cells as a function of temperature showed that the products of ideality factor and the activation energy of the pre-factor are the same for nc-Si:H solar cells with different crystallinities. A mobility bandgap at 0K of 1.06eV was derived from these studies. Finally, the temperature dependence of open circuit voltage (Voc) of nc-Si:H solar cells with different Voc values at 25°C shows the same intersection of 1.04eV at 0K. It provides additional evidence that the mobility bandgap is independent of crystallinity and is similar to that of c-Si. The values obtained from both the methods are similar to but smaller than the bandgap of c-Si at 0K; however, the difference could result from experimental errors.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate tandem amorphous/microcrystalline silicon solar cells with asymmetric intermediate reflectors grown in the n–i–p substrate configuration. We compare different types of substrates with respect to their light-trapping properties as well as their influence on the growth of single-junction microcrystalline cells. Our most promising back reflector combines a textured zinc oxide film grown by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, a silver film for reflection, and a zinc oxide buffer layer. Grown on this substrate, microcrystalline cells exhibit excellent response in the infrared while keeping high open-circuit voltage and fill factor, leading to efficiencies of up to 10.0%. After optimizing the morphology of the asymmetric intermediate reflector, we achieve an n–i–p micromorph solar cell stabilized efficiency of 11.6%, using 270nm and 1.7μm of silicon for the absorber layer of the amorphous top cell and the microcrystalline bottom cell, respectively. Using this original device architecture, we reach efficiencies close to those of state-of-the-art n–i–p and p–i–n micromorph devices, demonstrating a promising route to deposit high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells on opaque substrates.

Abstract: We report the self-assembly of InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) grouped along lines on semiconductor surfaces. Nanoscale spatial thermal modulations were created in-situ on strained-but-flat InGaAs surfaces in a Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) growth chamber by employing interferential irradiations of high power laser pulses. As-irradiated surfaces were examined using an attached ultra-high vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). STM images indicate that the irradiation induces self-assembly of QDs. The average size of laser-induced QDs is smaller while their density is larger than that of QDs formed by the typical Stranski–Krastanov (S–K) growth mode. Furthermore, the dot density is modulated sinusoidally with a periodicity commensurate with that of the interference, which suggests that the placement of QDs can be controlled on the scale of the optical wavelength used.

Abstract: The primary role of fibroblasts is production and degradation of extracellular matrix, and thus it helps in the structural framework of tissues. The close relation between fibroblast malfunction and many diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and fibrosis is widely accepted. Fibroblasts are known to respond to different growth factors and cytokines including platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF). However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms are not entirely clear. In addition to complex phosphorylation-driven signaling pathways, PDGF is also known to work through Ca2+ signaling. We hypothesize that in human pulmonary fibroblasts, Ca2+ waves play an important role in PDGF-mediated changes. To test this hypothesis, we treated human pulmonary fibroblasts, obtained from the lungs of ten donors, with PDGF acutely or overnight plus/minus a variety of blockers under various conditions. Ca2+ waves were monitored by confocal [Ca2+]i fluorimetry, while gene expression of extracellular matrix genes was assessed via RT-PCR method. We found that both acute and overnight PDGF treatment evoked Ca2+ waves. Removal of external Ca2+ or depletion of internal Ca2+ store using Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) completely occluded PDGF-evoked Ca2+ waves. Ryanodine, which blocks ryanodine receptor channels, had no effect on PDGF-evoked Ca2+ wave, whereas the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 and Xestospongin C, a potent IP3 receptor blocker, reduced the rapid PDGF-response to a relatively slowly-developing rise in [Ca2+]i. We also found that PDGF dramatically increased the expression of fibronectin1 and collagen A1 genes, which was reversed by the use of CPA or U73122. Our study indicates that, in human pulmonary fibroblasts, PDGF acts through IP3-induced Ca2+-release to trigger Ca2+ waves, which in turn modulate gene expression of several matrix proteins.

Abstract: A primary optics for solar concentrator made of an achromatic Fresnel doublet has been designed and manufactured. The achromatic Fresnel doublet combines the advantages of plastic lenses without being affected by chromatic aberrations. The performance has been determined experimentally using a homemade continuous solar simulator and compared to paraxial theory and ray-tracing simulations. Experimental results are in good agreement with theory and show that the achromatic Fresnel doublet is tolerant to manufacturing errors and uncertainty on the dispersion of the refractive index: the concentration factor remains above 1600× with an f-number of 2.

Abstract: To enhance the work function of indium tin oxide (ITO) and make its surface hydrophobic, triethoxy(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-octyl)silane (FOTES) was introduced as a self-assembly monolayer (SAM) material. A polymer solar cell has been fabricated with FOTES–ITO, and due to decreased series resistance (RS) and increased shunt resistance (RSH), the short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) of the optimized device were 9.2mA/cm2, 0.63V and 57.9%, respectively. The calculated power conversion efficiency (PCE) was 3.4%. In addition, the air stability of the fabricated device was improved.

Abstract: The radiation response of GaAs PiN solar cells with 50 stacked layers containing self-aligned In0.4Ga0.6As quantum dots (QDs) was compared to that of GaAs PiN solar cells with non QD layers. Those solar cells were radiated with 1MeV electrons up to 1×1016/cm2, and the change in their electrical characteristics under AM 0 was investigated using an in-situ measurement technique. After electron irradiation at 1×1016/cm2, the value of open circuit voltage (VOC) for the In0.4Ga0.6As 50 QD and the non QD solar cells remained 90 and 80% of the initial value, respectively. On the other hand, the values of short circuit current (ISC) and maximum power (PMAX) for the 50 QD solar cells became approximately 80 and 55% of the initial value by electron irradiation at 1×1016/cm2, respectively, although the non QD solar cells showed 95% for ISC and 63% for PMAX after the irradiation. The recovery of the electrical characteristics of both the InGaAs 50 QD and the non QD solar cells irradiated with electrons at 1×1016/cm2 were observed under AM0 light illumination at RT.

Abstract: The characterization of InxGa1−xN/GaN-based solar cells with a InxGa1−xN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) structure on SiCN/Si(111) substrates at various operation temperatures is reported. Solar cell operation with a low dark-current density (Jd), a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), and a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) is demonstrated. An increase in the operation temperature results in increases in Jd and Jsc, but decreases in Voc, the fill factor (FF), and the photovoltaic efficiency (η). Device configurations with various levels of indium content are investigated under an air mass 1.5 global solar spectrum. The proposed structure can be used for fabricating solar cells with a low Jd of 2.01–4.27μA/cm2, a high Voc of 2.34–2.94V, a high Jsc of 2.71–2.82mA/cm2, a high FF of 64.40–75.01%, and a high η of 4.25–5.99%.

Abstract: High conductivity poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spray cast to form highly flexible transparent electrodes for forward- and inverted-mode organic solar cells (OSCs). A multiple solvent ink containing ethylene glycol was developed, and a post-deposition annealing step contributed to a high conductivity of 1070±50Scm−1. Sheet resistance and transmission at a wavelength of 550nm were controlled within 24–259Ω□−1 and 71–95%, respectively, which are amongst the best-reported combined characteristics. Forward-mode OSCs with spray coated PEDOT:PSS anodes yielded a power conversion efficiency of 3.2%. Mechanical bending and stretching tests demonstrated that the flexibility of these PEDOT:PSS layers were far superior to that of ITO: elastic moduli were reduced by more than an order of magnitude, and the resistance increased far more slowly under both uniaxial stretching and bending to progressively smaller radii of curvature. With these experiments, the minimum radii of curvature and maximum uniaxial strains at which acceptable performance is maintained were investigated. Collectively, our results illustrate a promising future for the scalable printing of low-cost PEDOT:PSS-based flexible transparent electrodes.

Abstract: Viroporins are a group of viral proteins that participate in viral replication cycles, including modification of membrane permeability and promotion of viral release. Although biological data have been accumulated on viroporion-like proteins of other viruses belonging to family Flaviviridae, the viroporin activity and membrane topology of p7 protein from classical swine fever virus (CSFV), a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, are largely unknown. In this study, sequence analysis of the primary structure of p7 polypeptide demonstrates that p7 contains two putative transmembrane regions connected by a short hydrophilic segment. Expression of p7 protein in Escherichia coli leads to the permeabilization of bacterial cells to small molecules. The p7 protein also enhances the permeability of mammalian cells, increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and the permeability of cells to the translation inhibitor Hygromycin B. This protein is an integral membrane protein and can form homo-oligomers. It mainly localizes to the ER at the early stage of the expression and can be transferred to the plasma membrane at the late stage of the expression. Detergent permeabilization assays confirmed that the p7 protein is a 2-pass transmembrane protein and its N and C termini are exposed to the ER lumen. Deletion analysis showed that amino acid residues 41–63 may be essential for the viroporin activity of the protein. Our studies demonstrate that CSFV p7 possesses properties commonly associated with viroporins, which could be a potential target for the development of a therapeutic intervention for classic swine fever virus infection.

Abstract: Transcription factors of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) family play a key role in various biological processes. In this study, we explored the role of NF-κB in the dysfunction of splenic macrophages in hypersplenism due to liver cirrhosis. By using confocal microscopic analysis, Western Blot, TransAM NF-κB ELISA, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we observed that NF-κB p65, p52, and c-Rel were activated in macrophages in patients with hypersplenism (hypersplenic macrophages). Transfection of hypersplenic macrophages with a κB/luciferase reporter plasmid showed that NF-κB complexes were functional. Using co-immunoprecipitation studies, we demonstrated that p65/c-Rel dimers were activated in hypersplenic macrophages. NF-κB activation inhibitor JSH-23 and the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated p65, and c-Rel gene silencing significantly blocked phagocytosis and secretion in hypersplenic macrophages. Using promoter analysis and RNA interference, we found that many phagocytotic and hepatic fibrogenetic regulators, including interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were regulated by NF-κB p65 and c-Rel in hypersplenic macrophages. Our findings demonstrate that NF-κB p65 and c-Rel play an important role in phagocytosis and secretion in hypersplenic macrophages. Activation of NF-κB p65 and c-Rel may be considered an important regulator of hypersplenism and liver cirrhosis.

Abstract: CuInSe2 (CIS) thin films were formed on a Mo-coated soda lime glass with a newly formulated hybrid ink composed of binary Cu2−xSe nanoparticles and an In precursor solution. The thin films were fabricated by the spin coating method and a subsequent selenization process, and the compositional and structural properties of the CIS thin films were characterized. Deposition of a hybrid ink provides the unique advantage of producing centers composed of pure material-based nanoparticles that can promote stress-relief and crack-deflection. Additionally, hybrid inks offer efficient binding with nanoparticles by using precursor solutions without other organic binders. Binary Cu2−xSe nanoparticles were synthesized by a low-temperature colloidal process, and an In precursor solution was prepared by using a non-toxic chelating agent for dispersing the In component stably. The band gap of the CIS thin film was measured to be 1.14eV by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) technique, and the best conversion efficiency of the fabricated device was determined to be 4.19%.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage applications require readily available commercial PCMs which offer suitable thermal properties desired for thermal applications. However, commercial PCMs in the market are restricted with few material groups which include mostly different paraffin waxes and salt hydrates. Therefore, three commercial products which have been currently used in cosmetics and personal care industry have been investigated from the perspective of thermal energy storage engineering. The presented commercial products have the main compositions of different high-chain mono- and diesters with the trade names of Cutina EGMS, Cutina AGS and Cutina CP. Thermal properties of the commercial products have been presented with necessary statistical calculations in terms of phase change temperature, enthalpy, specific heat capacity (Cp) values of liquid and solid states, thermal decomposition and thermal reliability after 1000 thermal cycles. The DSC analyses indicate that the melting temperatures are between 44°C and 60°C with phase change enthalpies above 180kJ/kg. According to the presented results, Cutina EGMS has average whereas Cutina AGS and Cutina CP have fairly well thermal behaviors and properties for low temperature heat transfer applications. The research outcomes offer a new potential market to the investigated products.

Abstract: A computer code based on the characteristic matrix formulation and a Monte Carlo algorithm have been devised for the optical design of D/M/WO3 combined electrochromic-transparent conducting coatings. When these coatings are incorporated into electrochromic devices, the WO3 film serves a dual purpose: It anti-reflects the metal in the bleached state and becomes absorptive in the colored state (as a LixWO3 tungsten bronze). The optimum design was found to be Glass/ZnS (34nm)/Ag (15nm)/WO3 (326nm), with the WO3 layer being thick to ensure adequate optical modulation. Simulation of the coating in the colored state revealed an asymmetry in its response related to the direction of the incoming radiation, with high absorptance in one direction and high reflectance in the opposite one. This feature was verified experimentally and it has not been observed in typical electrochromic devices. Substitution of the ZnS layer with WO3, of the Ag layer with Au, and addition of a 4th Al2O3 protective layer were found to be feasible alternatives to the optimum design. Glass/WO3/Ag/WO3 coatings have been fabricated by electron beam gun deposition. They are transparent in the visible (Tlum=57%), reflective in the infrared with emittance equal to 0.09 and electrically conductive (Rsheet=9Ω). These coatings were incorporated into electrochromic devices of the type Glass/WO3/Ag/WO3/1M LiCLO4–PC/SnO2:F/Glass. Such devices exhibit a transmittance contrast ratio of 10:1 at 550nm for 90mC/cm2 of inserted charge density, and a coloration efficiency of about 30cm2/C at 534nm. They can also withstand more than 500 voltammetric coloration–bleaching cycles.

Abstract: Organic solar cells (OSCs) generally degrade seriously due to the rapid intake of oxygen and water if exposed to the air. In this paper, we investigated the extrinsic degradation of OSCs by showing the remarkable acceleration effect of fluorescent lamps. We attributed this effect to the accelerated lateral diffusion of oxygen in the fullerene layer under light. We simulated the dynamics of this process using a finite-element method. The simulation suggests that the diffusion constant of oxygen in cells increases approximately sevenfold under fluorescent lamps. We finally reported a recovering phenomenon of an unencapsulated OSC in dark, which demands more investigations.

Abstract: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is organized in nucleoids in complex with accessory proteins, proteins of mtDNA replication and gene expression machinery. A robust mtDNA genome is represented by hundreds to thousands of nucleoids in cell mitochondrion. Detailed information is lacking about the dynamics of nucleoid distribution within the mitochondrial network upon physiological and pathological events. Therefore, we used confocal microscopy to study mitochondrial nucleoid redistribution upon mitochondrial fission and following reintegration of the mitochondrial network. Fission was induced by oxidative stress at respiration inhibition by rotenone or upon elimination of the protonmotive force by uncoupling or upon canceling its electrical component, ΔΨm, by valinomycin; and by silencing of mitofusin MFN2. Agent withdrawal resulted in concomitant mitochondrial network reintegration. We found two major principal morphological states: (i) a tubular state of the mitochondrial network with equidistant nucleoid spacing, 1.10±0.2 nucleoids per μm, and (ii) a fragmented state of solitary spheroid objects in which several nucleoids were clustered. We rarely observed singular mitochondrial fragments with a single nucleoid inside and very seldom we observed empty fragments. Reintegration of fragments into the mitochondrial network re-established the tubular state with equidistant nucleoid spacing. The two major morphological states coexisted at intermediate stages. These observations suggest that both mitochondrial network fission and reconnection of the disintegrated network are nucleoid-centric, i.e., fission and new mitochondrial tubule formation are initiated around nucleoids. Analyses of combinations of these morphological icons thus provide a basis for a future mitochondrial morphology diagnostics.

Abstract: This paper addresses a major issue related to the use of upgraded-metallurgical grade silicon for n-type solar cells. We show that n-type silicon ingots, grown from silicon feedstock containing both boron and phosphorus, display a vertical net doping variation which is incompatible with high-yield production of high-efficiency solar cells. As a solution, we propose to use compensation engineering, by means of gallium co-doping, and demonstrate its potential to control the net doping along the ingot height. The resulting material exhibits high minority carrier diffusion length gratefully to compensation but degrades upon illumination due to the activation of the boron–oxygen defect. This latter degradation remains an important though not unsurmountable challenge for making high-efficiency n-type solar cells with upgraded-metallurgical grade silicon.

Abstract: The influence of the interface morphologies on amorphous silicon thin-film solar cells prepared on randomly textured substrates was studied. A simple three-dimensional geometrical model was developed to describe the surface morphology of amorphous silicon films and thin-film solar cells. The simulated surface morphologies are confirmed by experimental measurements. A detailed understanding of the interface morphologies is required to gain insights in the light-trapping of silicon thin-film solar cells on randomly textured substrates and derive strategies to improve the light-trapping properties. The morphology of amorphous silicon solar cell layers is calculated by using atomic force microscope scans of the randomly textured substrates and the thickness of layers as input data. The influence of the interface morphologies on the surface roughness, average film thickness and size of surface textures is investigated. Finally the influence of these parameters on the light-trapping and optical losses is discussed.

Abstract: A new series of fullerene (C60) multiadducts of methyl ester substituted thieno-o-quinodimethane were synthesized for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The synthesized 5-methyl ester thieno-o-quinodimethane fullerene (C60) multiple adducts, such as METFMA (mono-adduct), METFBA (bis-adduct) and METFTA (tris-adduct), showed good solubility in toluene, CHCl3 and ODCB. Their molecular structures were confirmed by 1H, 13C NMR, UV–visible spectroscopy, DSC, TGA and HRMS Cyclic voltammetry revealing a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of −3.65eV for METFMA, −3.53eV for METFBA and −3.42eV for METFTA, which is higher than that of PC61BM. The higher LUMO energy level of METFMA, METFBA and METFTA resulted in an enhancement of the open-circuit voltages (Voc) of PSCs. Device of the multiple adduct acceptors was blended with a P3HT donor with the configuration, ITO/PEDOT/P3HT:acceptor/LiF/Al, using METFMA, METFBA, METFTA and PC61BM as the electron acceptor. The optimal photovoltaic performances were achieved using METFBA and METFTA with power conversion efficiencies of 3.00% and 2.93%, respectively. These results were comparable to the device conducted with P3HT:PC61BM (3.42%) under the same conditions.

Abstract: Polymer solar cell (PSC) with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Bphen/Ag was fabricated using spray coating method, and the influence of in situ annealing treatment on the PSC performance was studied. Comparing the performance of in situ annealed PSC with that of conventional post-annealed cell, the results showed that the in situ annealing treatment at low temperature not only corresponding to 12% enhancement of fill factor, but also resulting in 13% increase of open circuit voltage. The interpenetrating networks of P3HT:PCBM film were characterized by X-ray diffraction, and surface morphologies have been studied by atomic force microscope. The performance enhancement of PSC was attributed to the improved hole mobility of P3HT:PCBM blend and the increased interaction of active layer.

Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the effect of antimony (Sb) on the uniform incorporation of nitrogen atoms in GaInNAs alloy grown with different levels of Sb fluxes. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity and full-width at half maximum (FWHM) are both improved for a narrow range of Sb flux between 1×10−8 and 5×10−8Torr, in which Sb plays the role of surfactant. On the other hand, higher level of Sb flux deteriorates the PL characteristics most likely due to Sb-related defects. Furthermore in temperature dependent PL measurements, drastic peak energy shifts were observed in all samples, which indicate a strong carrier localization. Although GaInNAs sample showed a large energy shift of 53meV, supply of Sb decreased the localization energies to 13–22meV. These results show that optimized amount of Sb, maintaining a high growth temperature of 520°C, enhances the homogeneity of potential energy in conduction band of GaInNAs alloy, since the carrier localization is led by inhomogeneous N incorporation.

Abstract: With crystalline silicon technology around in commercial products for over 30 years and still dominating the PV market for the foreseeable future, it is important to consider how this technology can be improved to cope with the increasing demand for lower cost. This paper builds on a concept proposed by imec, integrated-interconnect-module (i2-module), to merge current crystalline silicon cell and module technology with module-level thin-film technology. It investigates, in particular, how hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers can be deposited on wafers that are bonded to a glass superstrate, to provide a low-temperature (heterojunction) approach for passivation and emitter formation in this concept. First, the concept is introduced, together with its context and motivation for a-Si:H heterojunctions. Then, the experiments are described. Starting from screening trials on temporarily and permanently bonded wafers, the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) a-Si:H deposition process is optimized by shielding the adhesive from the plasma, resulting in comparable surface passivation quality between bonded samples and standalone wafers. Finally, first attempts toward integration into solar cell devices are reported, resulting into efficiencies above 18%.

Abstract: Suspended particle devices (SPDs) allow rapid voltage-controlled modulation of their optical transmittance and are of interest for solar-energy-related and other applications. We investigated the spectral total and diffuse transmittance of an SPD, including its angular dependence. The optical modulation was large for visible light but almost nil in the infrared, and the devices had noticeable haze. A theoretical two-flux model was formulated and provided a quantitative description of the absorption and scattering coefficients and thereby of the detailed optical performance. This analysis gives a benchmark for assessing improvements of the SPD technology as well as for comparing it with alternative technologies for optical modulation.

Abstract: The performance of sputtered CdS/CdTe solar cells with MoO3−x/Au contacts was examined. The cells were fabricated on Pilkington SnO2:F-coated soda-lime glass with a high resistivity transparent SnO2 buffer layer. The MoO3-x/Au back contact layers were deposited by thermal evaporation. The incorporation of the MoO3−x layer was found to improve the open circuit voltage (VOC) but reduce the fill factor (FF) of the sputtered CdS/CdTe cells. While VOC is not sensitive to the thickness of the MoO3 layer, FF is very sensitive. The optimal thickness for the MoO3 layer is found to be 2–5nm, which yields nearly 12% efficiency. The performance of these CdS/CdTe solar cells was further evaluated under thermal stress at 200°C in controlled environments. We found that the cells degraded significantly under thermal stress in air, due to the increase of series resistance or decrease of FF.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes/Prussian blue (CNT/PB) films were prepared and tested as electrodes for electrochemical devices. The thicknesses (and transmittances) of the different films were controlled through the amount of both CNTs and PB. The electrochromic behavior of the films was compared to a PB film electro-synthesized by the classical route, showing improvement in several parameters, mainly the stability towards electrochemical cycles. The five different CNT/PB films presented Coulombic efficiency between 91 and 94%, coloration efficiency between 61.1 and 138.6cm2C−1, response time between 1.1 and 3.2s and oxidation/reduction charge between 0.17 and 0.69mCcm−2. The combination of the electrochromic parameters and high stability should enable the CNT/PB films to be suitable for technological applications.

Abstract: Heterojunction is an important structure for the development of photovoltaic solar cells. In contrast to homojunction structures, heterojunction solar cells have internal crystalline interfaces, which will reflect part of the incident light, and this has not been considered carefully before though many heterostructure solar cells have been commercialized. This paper discusses the internal reflection for various material systems used for the development of heterostructure-based solar cells. It has been found that the most common heterostructure solar cells have internal reflection less than 2%, while some potential heterojunction solar cells such as ITO/GaAs, ITO/InP, Si/Ge, polymer/semiconductors and oxide semiconductors may have internal reflection as high as 20%. Also it is worse to have a window layer with a lower refractive index than the absorption layer for solar cells. Ignoring this strong internal reflection will lead to severe deterioration and reduction of conversion efficiency; therefore measures have to be taken to minimize or prevent this internal reflection.

Abstract: CrMoN(H)/CrMoN(L)/CrON tandem absorber was deposited on stainless steel (SS) and aluminum (Al) substrates by the sputtering method. The nitrogen flow rate was varied in order to obtain the CrMoN(H) (high metal content) and CrMoN(L) (low metal content) layers. The structural properties of the coatings were studied using the X-ray diffraction technique. The optimized tandem absorber on SS substrate exhibited high absorptance in the range of 0.90–0.92 and emittance in the range of 0.13–0.15. The optical constants of CrMoN(H), CrMoN(L) and CrON layers were obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometric measurements. The optical constants data revealed that the CrMoN(H) layer is the main absorber layer in the tandem absorber. The tandem absorber deposited on SS substrates was thermally stable up to 425 and 500°C in air and vacuum for 7h, respectively. The changes in the chemical composition of the tandem absorber were studied by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy techniques. The tandem absorber deposited on Al substrates qualified the performance criterion evaluation test and the service life time of the coating is more than 25 years.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells derived from human Wharton's jelly (WJ-MSC) have emerged as a favorable source for autologous and allogenic cell therapy. Here, we characterized the proangiogenic features of WJ-MSCs and examined their ability to form functional vessels in in vivo models. First, we examined whether WJ-MSCs express endothelial and smooth muscle cell specific markers after culture in endothelial growth media. WJ-MSCs expressed an endothelial specific marker, VEGFR1, at mRNA and protein levels, but did not express other specific markers (VEGFR2, Tie2, vWF, CD31, and VE-cadherin). Rather, WJ-MSCs expressed smooth muscle cell specific markers, α-SMA, PDGFR-β and calponin, and were unable to form tube-like structures with lumen on Matrigel. WJ-MSCs secreted growth factors including angiogenin, IGFBP-3, MCP-1, and IL-8, which stimulated endothelial proliferation, migration, and tube formation. When WJ-MSCs suspended in Matrigel were implanted into nude mice, it led to formation of functional vessels containing erythrocytes after 7 days. However, implantation of endothelial cell-suspended Matrigel resulted in no perfused vessels. The implanted WJ-MSCs were stained positively for calponin or PDGFR-β and were located adjacent to the lining of mouse endothelial cells that were stained with labeled BS-lectin B4. In a murine hindlimb ischemia model, the transplantation of MSCs (5×105cells) into the ischemic limbs improved perfusion recovery and neovascularization of the limbs compared to control group. Therefore, the results suggest that WJ-MSCs promote neovascularization and perfusion by secreting paracrine factors and by functioning as perivascular precursor cells, and that WJ-MSCs can be used efficiently for cell therapy of ischemic disease.

Abstract: Up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are implicated in lung inflammation. Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) has been shown to act via activation of P2 purinoceptors, leading to COX-2 expression in various inflammatory diseases. The mechanisms of ATP-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 release remain unclear. We showed that pretreatment with the inhibitors of P2 receptors (PPADS and Suramin), Gq protein (GPA2A), phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C (PC-PLC; D609), phosphoinositide-phospholipase C (PI-PLC; ET-18-OCH3), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII; KN62), protein kinase C (PKC; Gö6976, Ro-318220, GF109203X, and rottlerin), MEK1/2 (PD98059), p38 MAPK (SB202190), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB; Bay11-7082) and the intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM) or transfection with siRNAs of these molecules and cPLA2 reduced ATPγS-induced COX-2 expression or PGE2 production in A549 cells. In addition, ATPγS-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration was attenuated by PPADS, Suramin, D609, or ET-18-OCH3. ATPγS-induced p38 MAPK, p42/p44 MAPK, and NF-κB p65 activation were inhibited by Gö6976, Ro-318220, GF109203X, or rottlerin. ATPγS also induced cPLA2 phosphorylation and activity, which were reduced via inhibition of P2 receptors, PKCs, p38 MAPK, and p42/p44 MAPK. ATPγS-induced cPLA2 expression was inhibited by SB202190, PD98059, or Bay11-7082. In the in vitro study, we established that ATPγS induced PGE2 generation via a cPLA2/COX-2-dependent pathway. In the in vivo study, we found that ATPγS induced COX-2 mRNA expression in the lungs and leukocyte (mainly eosinophils and neutrophils) count in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in mice via a P2 receptors-dependent signaling pathway. We concluded that ATPγS may induce lung inflammation via a cPLA2/COX-2/PGE2-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Hot carrier solar cells (HCSCs) are a high-efficiency third generation solar cell concept. One major difficulty in realizing HSCSs is the delay of the hot carrier cooling process in their absorber. Bulk boron antimonide (BSb) was investigated with ab initio methods for its potential as hot carrier absorber (HCA). Our calculation results of its phononic structure show that several phonon decay processes are suppressed, leading to a phonon bottleneck and a considerable delay of carrier cooling. Results on its electronic structure reveal a low electron effective mass and an indirect band gap of 0.59eV. Surprisingly high experimental values of the absorption coefficient near band gap are explained by distinct features of the electronic and phononic band dispersions and provide favorable optical properties for a HCA.

Interleukin-17 modulates myoblast cell migration by inhibiting urokinase type plasminogen activator expression through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase,

Abstract: Interleukin-17 belongs to a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines with pleiotropic effects, which can be associated with several inflammatory diseases of the muscle tissue. Although elevated levels of interleukin-17 have been described in inflammatory myopathies, its role in muscle homeostasis remains to be elucidated. The requirement of the urokinase type plasminogen activator in skeletal myogenesis was recently demonstrated in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration and myoblast fusion. Our previous results have demonstrated that interleukin-17 inhibits myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in vitro concomitantly with the inhibition of cell migration. However, the involvement of urokinase type plasminogen activator in interleukin-17-inhibited myogenesis and migration remained to be analyzed. Therefore, the effect of interleukin-17 on the production of urokinase type plasminogen activator by C2C12 myoblasts was determined in the present study. Our results demonstrated that interleukin-17 strongly inhibits urokinase type plasminogen activator expression during myogenic differentiation. This reduction of urokinase type plasminogen activator production corresponded with the inhibition of cell migration by interleukin-17. Activation of p38 signaling pathway elicited by interleukin-17 mediated the inhibition of both urokinase type plasminogen activator expression and cell migration. Additionally, IL-17 inhibited C2C12 cells migration by causing the cells to reorganize their cytoskeleton and lose polarity. Therefore, our results suggest a novel mechanism by which interleukin-17 regulates myogenic differentiation through the inhibition of urokinase type plasminogen activator expression and cell migration. Accordingly, interleukin-17 may represent a potential clinical target worth investigating for the treatment of inflammatory muscle diseases.

Abstract: Chemically modified fullerenes and chlorinated solvents have been predominantly chosen in the recent studies of the photovoltaic devices based on polymer bulk heterojunction composites. However, these items seem to be undesirable because of their potential impacts on the environment as well as the consumption of resources. In this context, a systematic study on the annealing effect and film composition dependence of bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices based on composites consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and neat C70 prepared with a chlorine-free solvent 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene has been carried out. For the device using P3HT:C70 composite (2:1 by weight) film as an active layer, power conversion efficiency of 1.47%, with open-circuit voltage of 0.52V, short-circuit current density of 6.2mA/cm2 and fill-factor of 45%, has been obtained after post-production annealing at 160°C. The combination of neat fullerenes with naturally obtained solvents will open up a new way to produce cost-effective and environmentally-friendly photovoltaic devices based on polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction composites.

Abstract: Organic solar cells are appealing with respect to their inorganic counterparts because the functional layers of these devices can be processed from solution with technologies such as inkjet printing. In order to be able to use inkjet printing on a large scale, hazardous, chlorinated solvents should be avoided when depositing the functional materials. In this work, a novel adapted absorber polymer was blended with fullerene and inkjet printing was used to deposit the blend films. A special emphasis was placed on finding a chlorine-free solvent system which delivers good device performance. A chlorine-free solvent system based on anisole and tetralin delivered efficiencies of 2.7% which compares to 3.5% for active layers that were printed from chlorinated solvents. A coarser phase separation was found with energy filtered transmission electron microscopy plasmon mapping which most likely resulted in the performance differences for the chlorinated and chlorine-free solvent systems.

Abstract: Mitochondria produce the most part of the energy used by the cells. This energetic production occurs through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process. Mitochondrial functions such as OXPHOS need to be tightly regulated to respect the needs of cells. Phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins now appears as a major regulation pathway of mitochondrial functions. Several kinases and phosphatases are specifically targeted to mitochondria where they modulate mitochondrial functions. However, we still poorly understand the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation events on mitochondrial metabolism. Among the tyrosine-kinases observed in mitochondria, Src kinases emerge as key players. In the past years, several mitochondrial proteins were shown to be substrates of Src kinases. Notably, these kinases can impact greatly OXPHOS and apoptosis. Important regulators of Src kinases activity are also observed in mitochondria. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent findings on how overall mitochondrial tyrosine phosphorylation events and more specifically Src kinases can influence mitochondrial functions. The different mechanisms of Src kinases regulation and translocation into mitochondria will be also discussed. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

Abstract: The neuroinflammatory process is thought to contribute to the progression of neurological disorders and brain pathologies. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by activated glial cells, astrocytes and microglia plays an important role in this process. However, the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), the key transcription factor regulating the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes, during glial activation is less known. Thus, we examined the significance of HIF-1α in three experimental models: first in an acute model of inflammation induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ; secondly, in a chronic model of inflammation using an APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and thirdly via the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway in a model of neuronal apoptosis. During acute glial inflammation induced by in vitro administration of TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ, mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α were significantly upregulated; however, this effect was blocked by SP600126, a pharmacological inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). These data suggest that MAPKs could be involved in HIF-1α regulation. In addition, we observed that HIF-1α is not involved in the neuronal apoptotic process mediated by PI3-kinase inhibition, which is regulated by c-Jun. Finally, we did not detect significant differences in the expression of HIF-1α mRNA in APP/PS1 mice during the course of the study (3–12 months of age). Thus, we demonstrated that HIF-1α has a prominent role in acute but not in chronic inflammatory processes, such as the one which occurs in the APP/PS1 experimental model of AD. Moreover, HIF-1α is not involved in neuronal apoptosis after PI3K/AKT inhibition.

Abstract: Compartmentalization of the plasma membrane into lipid microdomains promotes efficient cellular processes by increasing local molecular concentrations. Calcium signaling, either as transients or propagating waves require integration of complex macromolecular machinery. Calcium waves represent a form of intercellular signaling in the central nervous system and the retina. We hypothesized that the mechanism for calcium waves would require effector proteins to aggregate at the plasma membrane in lipid microdomains. The current study shows that in Müller glia of the retina, proteins involved in calcium signaling aggregate in detergent resistant membranes identifying rafts and respond by redistributing on stimulation. We have investigated Purinoreceptor-1 (P2Y1), Ryanodine receptor (RyR), and Phospholipase C (PLC-β1). P2Y1, RyR and PLC-β1, redistribute from caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 positive fractions on stimulation with the agonists, ATP, 2MeS-ATP and Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of sarcoplasmic–endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA). Redistribution is absent on treatment with cyclopiazonic acid, another SERCA inhibitor. Disruption of rafts by removing cholesterol cause proteins involved in this machinery to redistribute and change agonist-induced calcium signaling. Cholesterol depletion from raft lead to increase in time to peak of calcium levels in agonist-evoked calcium signals in all instances, as seen by live imaging. This study emphasizes the necessity of a sub-population of proteins to cluster in specialized lipid domains. The requirement for such an organization at the raft-like microdomains may have implications on intercellular communication in the retina. Such concerted interaction at the rafts can regulate calcium dynamics and could add another layer of complexity to calcium signaling in cells.

Abstract: Economically viable copper oxide nano particles were prepared via a novel simplistic synthesis method using oleic acid as a solvent, surfactant and capping agent with varying reaction temperature (200°C, 300°C and 400°C) by solvothermal technique to develop a high efficiency solar cell. The influence of calcined temperature on crystalline size, purity, morphology, structural phase transition and stoichiometric formation of copper oxide powders were investigated by using powder X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The band gaps were calculated by optical studies. The luminescence spectra exhibit band to band transition of copper oxide nano particles. From TGA profile the mass reduction was occurred below 300°C. The growth mechanism of Copper oxide nano particles from copper chloride dihydrate with oleic acid (OA) investigated. The maximum overall conversion efficiency of 0.863% has been achieved from I to V characteristic study in favor of copper oxide nano particles calcined at 400°C.

Abstract: Polycrystalline Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films were prepared by a two-stage process namely thermal evaporation of stacked layers Cu/ZnSe/Sn/Se on soda-lime glass substrates held at different substrate temperatures (Ts) in the range 523–723K followed by annealing the stack in selenium atmosphere at 723K for an hour. The effect of Ts on the growth and properties of these films were analyzed by studying their structural, microstructural and optical properties. XRD studies revealed the structure to be kesterite with a=0.569nm and c=1.139nm. Raman spectroscopy is used as a complimentary tool to know the presence of possible secondary phases. The crystallinity of the films improved with increase in the substrate temperature. Spectral transmittance studies of these films revealed two optical transitions with direct band gaps of ∼1.0eV and 1.4eV which are attributed to CZTSe and CZTSe with minor ZnSe, as the annealed stack might be inhomogeneous.

Abstract: Self-cleaning and antifogging coatings are of great interest for application in outdoor solar cell installations to mitigate the performance loss and associated maintenance costs due to environmental contamination. These coatings, applied to the cover glass of solar panels, can remove contaminants when wetted with rain water and transmit more sunlight in foggy weather. Herein, we report a superhydrophilic silica nanoparticle film that exhibits the self-cleaning effect without relying on photocatalytic materials. When wetted with simulated light raining conditions, the coated glass removed 90% of surface contaminants, compared to only 48% removed from the bare glass. The deposited film created an antifogging surface in addition to increasing the solar transmittance (AM 1.5) of glass substrates by 4.3% over bare glass in the wavelength range of 350–1100nm.

Abstract: We describe a one-pot chemical synthesis to produce TiO2−x(OH)2x colloidal solutions that are suitable to be deposited, at 150°C only, as interfacial electron transporting layer, in inverted organic solar cells. The crystallized nanoparticles were synthesized from the hydrolysis of [Ti8O12(H2O)24]Cl8HCl·7H2O in organic solvent, using solvothermal method at 120°C. The UV-illumination of TiO2 colloidal solutions, before the deposition process, was found to improve the initial performance of solar cells. Compared to the usual sol–gel TiOx layer, no kink shape of the I/V curve is observed, indicating the good quality of the interfacial contact with the P3HT:PCBM blend of polymer. Additionally it is worth noting the significant improvement of the solar cells stability, characterized by a loss of power conversion efficiency limited to 17% after 6500h over continuous AM 1.5 illumination.

Abstract: Random Al and Ag nanoparticle distributions are studied on varying substrates, where we exploit the nanosphere self-aggregation (NSA) method for fabrication. Relying on the measured particle size distributions of these samples, we develop a theoretical model that can be applied to arbitrary random nanostructure layers as is demonstrated for several distinct NSA samples. As a proof of concept, the optical properties of the exact same particles distributions, made from the quasi-random modelling input with electron beam lithography (EBL), are investigated from both theory and experiment. Our numerical procedure is based on rigorous solutions of Maxwell's equations and yields optical spectra of fully interacting randomly positioned nanoparticle arrays. These results constitute a new methodology for improving the optical performance of layers of nanoparticles with direct application to enhanced photovoltaics.

Abstract: Silicon solar cell technology is evolving rapidly with recent improvements in both multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon wafers and ingots prepared by high throughput directional solidification, using both semiconductor grade and upgraded metallurgical grade silicon. Photoconductance and photoluminescence measurements are being rapidly developed to guide the development of these materials, with increasing attention being paid to combining steady-state and transient photoluminescence measurements to obtain self-consistent results. Analytical transient solutions are presented for both photoconductance and photoluminescence from silicon bricks or thick wafers which will guide this development by highlighting important interdependencies.

Abstract: Lectins from Diocleinae subtribe belong to the family of legume lectins and are characterized by high identity between their amino acids sequences. It has been shown that punctual differences in amino acid sequences, such as one single amino acid or an alternative conformation, represent changes in biological activities caused by these lectins. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of three-dimensional structures of these proteins is essential for accurate analyzing the relationship between structure and function. In this study lectins purified from the seeds of Dioclea violacea (DVL) and Dioclea rostrata (DRL) were compared with regard to crystal structure and vasorelaxant properties. Differences in structure of lectins were found to be reflected in differences in vasorelaxant effects based on their high specificity and selectivity for cell glycans. Binding activity was related to the position of specific residues in the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). DVL complexed structure was solved by X-ray crystallography and was compared to native DVL and DRL. Therefore, DVL was co-crystallized with X-Man, and a molecular modeling with X-Man complexed with DVL was done to compare the complexed and native forms adjusted fit. The relatively narrow and deep CRD in DVL promotes little interaction with carbohydrates; in contrast, the wider and shallower CRD in DRL favors interaction. This seems to explain differences in the level of relaxation induced by DVL (43%) and DRL (96%) in rat aortic rings.

Abstract: We investigated Ag nanowire (NW) network embedded ITO films as potential near infrared transparent and flexible electrodes for use in flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs). By embedding Ag NWs network between very thin ITO films using simple a brush painting method, we achieved a flexible ITO/Ag NW/ITO multilayer electrode with a low sheet resistance of 11.58Ω/sq, a high diffusive transmittance of 84.78%, as well as superior mechanical flexibility. The effective embedment of the Ag NW network between top and bottom ITO films led to a metallic conductivity, high near infrared transparency, and mechanical durability of the ITO/Ag NW/ITO multilayer. This indicate that embedment of the Ag NW network into thin ITO films is a key solution to solve the critical drawbacks associated with brittle ITO electrodes and Ag NW network films with weak adhesion. Furthermore, better performances of FOSCs with ITO/Ag NW/ITO multilayer electrodes than those of the FOSC with a conventional ITO electrode demonstrate that flexible ITO/Ag NW/ITO electrode is a promising alternative to conventional ITO films for high performance FOSCs.

Abstract: The lysosomal protease Cathepsin D (CD) plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and embryo–fetus abnormalities. It is therefore of interest to know how this protein is synthesized in animal species used for modeling human diseases. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is emerging as a valuable ‘in vivo’ vertebrate model for several human diseases. We have characterized the biogenetic pathways of zebrafish and human CD transgenically expressed in both human SH-SY5Y cells and zebrafish PAC2 cells. Differently from human CD, zebrafish CD was synthesized as a mono-glycosylated precursor (pro-CD) that was eventually processed into a single-chain mature polypeptide. In PAC2 cells, ammonium chloride and chloroquine impaired the N-glycosylation, and greatly stimulated the secretion, of pro-CD; still, a portion of un-glycosylated pro-CD reached the lysosomes and was processed to mature CD. The treatment with tunicamycin, which abrogates N-glycosylation, resulted in a similar effect. Zebrafish pro-CD was correctly processed when expressed in human cells, and its glycosylation, transport and maturation were not impaired by ammonium chloride. On the contrary, the transport and processing of human pro-CD expressed in zebrafish cells were profoundly altered: while the intermediate single-chain was not detectable, a small amount of double-chain mature CD still formed. This fact indicates that the enzyme machinery for single- to double-chain processing of mammal CD is present in zebrafish. Our data highlight the respective impact of the information imparted by the primary sequence and of the cellular transport and processing machineries in the biogenesis of lysosomal CD.

Photocurrent contributions from both components are observed and show a photoresponse down to approximately 1eV. The performance of the devices as a function of annealing time is investigated. A model for the effect of structure on the NIR response of these devices is developed and highlights the ambipolar nature of pC6TP as a charge transport material.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) play important roles in nicotine-induced cardiovascular disease. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the abnormal SMC behavioral response to nicotine, we investigated the activation of the NF-κB signal transduction pathway and cell adhesion molecular (CAM) expression on SMCs. Also we used different cell culture manner of SMC sole and EC–SMC co-culture with a 0.4 or a 3μm membrane pore, to observe whether there is a crosstalk between EC/SMC involved in the process of NF-κB pathway activation. Nicotine-induced effects were observed in SMCs by both monoculture and co-culture with the 3μm-pore size, including the phosphorylation of IKK and IκB, the shift of transcription factor NF-κB, and the enhancement of SMC cytoskeleton protein expression and migration ability, but none were observed by co-culture with the 0.4μm-pore size. All of the actions could be distinctly blocked by α-bungarotoxin (α7 nicotinic receptor inhibitor) or PDTC (NF-κB suppressor). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-1 and VCAM-1 and VLA-4 were better expressed similarly on the surface of SMCs in the monoculture and 3μm-pore size co-culture system vs. the 0.4μm co-culture way. The results imply that nicotine induces SMC cytoskeleton protein up-expression and migration via the NF-κB signaling pathway and that EC–SMC crosstalk via CAM facilitates its response to nicotine.

Abstract: Toxic aldehydes produced by alcohol dehydrogenases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori-related damage to the gastric mucosa. Despite this, the enzymes that might be responsible for producing such aldehydes have not been fully described. It was, therefore, of considerable interest to characterize the alcohol oxidizing enzymes in this pathogen. Previous work in this laboratory characterized two such H. pylori enzymes that had broad specificity for a range of aromatic alcohol substrates. However, an enzyme with specificity for aliphatic alcohols is likely to be required in order that H. pylori can metabolize the wide range of substrates encountered in the gastric mucosa. In this study we describe HpSCADH, an alcohol dehydrogenase from H. pylori 26695 with broad specificity for aliphatic alcohols. HpSCADH was classified in the cD1e subfamily of classical short chain alcohol dehydrogenases. The enzyme was a monomer of approximately 29kDa with a preference for NAD+ as cofactor. Pyrazole was found to be a competitive inhibitor of HpSCADH. The physiological role of this enzyme was explored by construction of an HpSCADH isogenic mutant. At pH 7.0 the mutant showed reduced growth which became more pronounced when the pH was lowered to 5.0. When pyrazole was added to wild type H. pylori cells it caused growth profiles to be reduced to match those of the isogenic mutant suggesting that HpSCADH inhibition alone was responsible for growth impairment. Taken together, the data relating to the alcohol metabolizing enzymes of this pathogen indicate that they play an important role in H. pylori growth and adaptation to acidic environments. The therapeutic potential of targeting H. pylori alcohol dehydrogenases is discussed.
