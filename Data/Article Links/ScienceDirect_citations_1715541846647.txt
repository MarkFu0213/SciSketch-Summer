Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at a uniquely high risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infections. The pre-emptive treatment model whereby asymptomatic post-transplant patients are routinely screened with treatment initiated if found viremic has recently been shown to be superior in terms of patient mortality when compared to deferring laboratory assessment and treatment until symptoms emerge. This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness of the pre-emptive therapy model in patient care dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Utilization and outcome data were compiled as a retrospective cohort study of 96 pediatric patients receiving HSCT at University of California Los Angeles Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department between the years 2006 and 2010. Two-decision tree models were constructed for each the pre-emptive model and the deferred model wherein costs and probability assumptions were based on either previously published literature or calculated from this study cohort.
RESULTS
The pre-emptive model resulted in a five-year survival of 71%, during which time 4% of patients were found to be EBV viremic, while 33% were found to be CMV viremic. The average actual cost of EBV/CMV virology screening per patient in the cohort following the pre-emptive model was $9699 while the expected cost following the deferred model was $19,284. This results in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio illustrating pre-emptive model cost-savings of $2367/QALY.
CONCLUSION
These results support the financial viability and prudence of scheduled screening for subclinical viremia for achieving optimal outcomes in a cost-effective manner in the pediatric HSCT population.

Abstract: Solar cells that convert sunlight into electrical power have demonstrated a large and consistent growth through several decades. The growth has spawned research on new technologies that potentially enable much faster, less costly and environmentally friendly manufacture from earth abundant materials. Here we review carbon based solar cells through a complete analysis of all the data that has been reported so far and we highlight what can be expected from carbon based technologies and draw scenarios of how it can be made of immediate use.

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that the kinase inhibitor Sorafenib efficiently blocks HCV replication by inhibition of c-Raf. However, a longer treatment with higher doses of Sorafenib might be associated with adverse effects. Therefore, it was analysed whether a decreased dose of Sorafenib can be applied in combination with interferon α to obtain additive antiviral, but at the same time decreased adverse effects. However, Sorafenib abolishes the inhibitory effect of interferon α on HCV replication and vice versa. In order to reveal the underlying mechanisms, we observed that on the one hand IFNα activates c-Raf and thereby counteracts the inhibitory effect of Sorafenib on HCV replication that is based on the Sorafenib-dependent inhibition of c-Raf. On the other hand we found that the IFNα-induced PKR-phosphorylation depends on c-Raf. So, Sorafenib as a potent inhibitor of c-Raf prevents the IFNα-dependent PKR phosphorylation. Moreover, Sorafenib inhibits c-Raf-independent the phosphorylation of STAT1 resulting in an impaired induction of IFNα-dependent genes. Taken together, these data indicate that a combined application of Sorafenib and interferon α in order to obtain an antiviral effect is not useful since Sorafenib exerts an inhibitory effect on targets that are crucial for the transduction of interferon α-dependent antiviral response.

Abstract: While high dose total body irradiation (TBI) is used therapeutically, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, increasing use of nuclear power, and worldwide radical terrorism underscore the need to develop countermeasures to a radiological mass casualty event. The hematopoietic syndrome of the acute radiation syndrome (HS-ARS) results from severe compromise to the hematopoietic system, including lymphocytopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and possible death from infection and/or hemorrhage. Given adequate time to recover, expand, and appropriately differentiate, bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and progenitor cells (HPC) may overcome HS-ARS and restore homeostasis of the hematopoietic system. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to have pleiotropic effects on hematopoiesis, acting to inhibit apoptosis and promote self-renewal of HSC, while inhibiting HPC proliferation. We assessed the radio-mitigating potential of modulating PGE2 signaling in a mouse model of HS-ARS. Treatment with the PGE2 analog 16,16 dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2) 6h post-irradiation or inhibition of PGE2 synthesis via delayed administration of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) Meloxicam resulted in increased survival of lethally irradiated mice. Both early dmPGE2 and delayed Meloxicam treatment were associated with increased HPC activity 35days following irradiation, demonstrating enhanced recovery of hematopoiesis. Our results define two different treatment modalities that are highly effective and safe to administer, and can be readily available.

Abstract: Elucidating ways to enhance megakaryopoiesis in vivo would have therapeutic applications for thrombocytopenia and transfusion medicine. Nicotinamide has been shown to enhance endomitosis in megakaryocytes cultured in vitro, suggesting that it may be beneficial for the production of platelets in culture. We hypothesized that regular injections of nicotinamide in mice would also increase platelets in vivo. However, we found that platelet counts were reduced by about 25% with daily injections of nicotinamide. Altering the schedule, duration, or nicotinamide dose did not improve platelet production. Consistent with lower platelet levels, nicotinamide also tended to decrease megakaryocyte frequency in sternum and spleen sections, as well as colony formation in vitro by bone marrow progenitor cells. However, there was no effect on the fraction or ploidy of CD41+ cells harvested from bone marrow. Together, our results suggest that, although nicotinamide increases polyploidization of megakaryocytes in culture, it does not have translatable effects in vivo.

Intracellular pigment epithelium-derived factor contributes to triglyceride degradation,

Abstract: Pigment epithelium-derived factor is well known as a secreted glycoprotein with multiple functions, such as anti-angiogenic, neuroprotective and anti-tumor activities. However, its intracellular role remains unknown. The present study was performed to demonstrate the intracellular function of pigment epithelium-derived factor on triglyceride degradation. Hepatic pigment epithelium-derived factor levels increased at the early stage and subsequently decreased after 16 weeks in high-fat-diet-fed mice compared to those in chow-fed mice. Similarly, oleic acid led to long-term downregulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor in HepG2 cells. Endogenous pigment epithelium-derived factor was an intracellular protein with cytoplasmic distribution in hepatocytes by immunostaining. Exogenous FITC-labeled pigment epithelium-derived factor could be absorbed into hepatocytes. Both signal peptide deletion and full-length pigment epithelium-derived factor transfection HeLa cells and hepatocytes promoted triglyceride degradation. Intracellular pigment epithelium-derived factor co-immunoprecipitated with adipose triglyceride lipase and promoted triglyceride degradation in an adipose triglyceride lipase-dependent manner. Additionally, pigment epithelium-derived factor bound to the C-terminal of adipose triglyceride lipase (aa268–504) and adipose triglyceride lipase-G0/G1 switch gene-2 complex simultaneously, which facilitated adipose triglyceride lipase-G0/G1 switch gene-2 translocation onto lipid droplet using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. Moreover, knockdown of endogenous pigment epithelium-derived factor in hepatocytes diminished triglyceride degradation. Taken together, these results indicate that hepatic pigment epithelium-derived factor was decreased in obese mice accompanied with hepatic steatosis. Intracellular pigment epithelium-derived factor binds to and facilitates adipose triglyceride lipase translocation onto lipid droplet, which promotes triglyceride degradation. These findings suggest that a decreased level of hepatic pigment epithelium-derived factor may contribute to hepatic steatosis in obesity.

Abstract: Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-l), a key part of the fibrinolytic system, plays a critical host protective role during the acute phase of infection by regulating interferon(IFN)-γ release. IFN-γ regulates PAI-1 expression, which suggests an intricate interplay between PAI-1 and IFN-γ. Here, using the notion of a feedback loop, we report the complicated regulatory relationship between PAI-1 and IFN-γ. Mice were inoculated intravenously with 1×103 colony forming units of Yersinia enterocolitica; PAI-1 deficiency enhanced lethality (p<0.0001) and increased bacterial growth and dissemination (p=0.08 on day 3, p=0.004 on day 5, respectively). PAI-1 significantly increased the levels IFN-γ mRNA (p<0.005), which may increase survival and decrease bacterial burden. Simultaneously, we showed that IFN-γ increased PAI-1 mRNA levels in vivo (p<0.05). Next, we investigated the transduction signal pathway. After mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 50μg lipopolysaccharide (LPS), both levels of IFN-γ mRNA (p=0.05) and levels of PAI-1 mRNA (p<0.0001) decreased in MyD88-deficient mice. The same trend was also found in mice treated with 1000μg LPS. As a result of correlations of IFN-γ and PAI-1 in wild-type mice, we delineated the transduction signal pathway, namely MyD88-IFN-γ-PAI-1. The in vivo LPS-injected animal model further confirmed that PAI-1 feedback controlled IFN-γ in a direct or indirect manner. New perspectives of the relationship between PAI-1 and IFN-γ should help in understanding the complex and often conflicting results that have been reported in different infection models. Thus, the feedback loop between PAI-1 and IFN-γ is part of the dynamic equilibrium of coagulation and inflammation that helps maintain innate immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Background
Previous reports have shown an increased risk for Parkinson disease (PD) among type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) patients. However, the number of the reported cases of GD/PD is small and it is unknown whether certain GD phenotypes are associated with an increased PD risk.
Objective
To present GD and PD characteristics of adults affected by both diseases from a large Israeli GD clinic, and assess whether certain GD characteristics are associated with a higher risk for PD.
Methods
Medical files of patients >18years between 1990 and 2010 were reviewed for PD signs or symptoms. Available patients with PD underwent an additional neurological examination. Demographic and GD characteristics were compared between GD patients with and without PD using t-test and Fisher exact. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to estimate age-specific risk for PD among males and females. Age-specific risk for PD was compared between males and females using Cox Hazard ratio model.
Results
510 type 1 GD adults (233 males; 45.7%), were evaluated. 11 PD patients were identified (2.2%). Among those with GD/PD cognitive impairment was common (7/11). Two patients underwent successful deep brain stimulation (DBS). PD diagnosis was associated with male gender (81.8% versus 44.9% male, p=0.027) and older age (mean age, PD=62.8, non-PD=47.1, p=0.004). GD phenotype and severity did not differ between the two groups, including mean Zimran Severity Score index (7.7 versus 8.3), percent splenectomized (15.8% versus 27.3%), history of avascular necrosis (13.0% versus 27.3%) and percent ever treated with enzyme replacement (49.4% versus 45.5%).
Conclusion
Male gender and older age are risk factors for PD among GD patients, but GD severity is not associated with increased risk for PD. Further research is required to assess which GD patients are at a higher risk for PD, and why.

Abstract: Taliglucerase alfa (Protalix Biotherapeutics, Israel) is a carrot-cell-expressed recombinant human beta-glucocerebrosidase recently approved in the United States for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease (GD). As bone disease is one of the most debilitating features of GD, quantification of bone marrow involvement is important for monitoring the response to treatment. Therefore, bone marrow fat fraction (Ff) measured by quantitative chemical shift imaging (QCSI) was included as exploratory parameter to evaluate bone marrow response in treatment naïve GD patients participating in a double-blind, randomized phase III study. Eight GD patients with intact spleens were treated with 30 or 60U/kg biweekly. Ff results were compared to outcomes in 15 untreated Dutch GD patients with a follow-up interval of 1year. Five taliglucerase alfa treated patients had a Ff below the threshold that relates to complication risk (<0.23) at baseline (median (n=8) 0.19, range 0.11–0.35). Ff significantly increased compared to baseline (p=0.012) and compared to untreated patients (p=0.005), already after 1year of follow-up with further improvement up to 36months. In four patients with the lowest Ff, the higher dose resulted in increases above 0.23 within 1year. All patients had sustained improvements in all other parameters. There was no influence of antibodies on response parameters. Treatment with taliglucerase alfa results in significant increases in lumbar spine fat fractions, which indicates clearance of Gaucher cells from the bone marrow.

Abstract: Highly efficient passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC cells) were fabricated using low cost laser ablation (LA) for pilot production. The laser source for the LA system had a wavelength of 532nm and pulse width of 20ns. To minimize the damage created during the LA process, the laser power density was optimized at 2.8J/cm2. Nevertheless, some damage occurred, such as dislocation and the formation of amorphous silicon, and was analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, and Sinton's quasi-steady-state photo-conductance (QSSPC). The measured laser damage depth was approximately 2.5μm. Since the local contact depth (eutectic alloy+back surface field (BSF)) was over 10μm when the cell fabrication was completed, this laser damage depth of 2.5μm was not problematic. After optimizing the geometry of the local contacts, the measured efficiency of the laser-ablated PERC solar cell was 19.78%.

Abstract: There is limited data on the occurrence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with Von Willebrand disease and the literature is even scarce on their management. We at our institute reviewed the medical records of 198 patients with Von Willebrand disease over a period of 15years, of which 6 were found to have symptomatic CAD. Acute coronary syndrome was noted in 3 patients while the remaining 3 had stable angina. Cardiac catheterization showed that left main coronary artery was the culprit vessel in all of these patients. In terms of management, stents were placed in 3 patients, two of them underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and the remaining one patient was medically managed. Aspirin, and in some patients clopidogrel, was well tolerated with minimal side effects.

Abstract: During the last three decades, a growing body of clinical, basic science and animal model data has demonstrated that blood transfusions have important effects on the immune system. These effects include: dysregulation of inflammation and innate immunity leading to susceptibility to microbial infection, down-regulation of cellular (T and NK cell) host defenses against tumors, and enhanced B cell function that leads to alloimmunization to blood group, histocompatibility and other transfused antigens. Furthermore, transfusions alter the balance between hemostasis and thrombosis through inflammation, nitric oxide scavenging, altered rheologic properties of the blood, immune complex formation and, no doubt, several mechanisms not yet elucidated. The net effects are rarely beneficial to patients, unless they are in imminent danger of death due to exsanguination or life threatening anemia. These findings have led to appeals for more conservative transfusion practice, buttressed by randomized trials showing that patients do not benefit from aggressive transfusion practices. At the risk of hyperbole, one might suggest that if the 18th and 19th centuries were characterized by physicians unwittingly harming patients through venesection and bleeding, the 20th century was characterized by physicians unwittingly harming patients through current transfusion practices. In addition to the movement to more parsimonious use of blood transfusions, an effort has been made to reduce the toxic effects of blood transfusions through modifications such as leukoreduction and saline washing. More recently, there is early evidence that reducing the storage period of red cells transfused might be a strategy for minimizing adverse outcomes such as infection, thrombosis, organ failure and mortality in critically ill patients particularly at risk for these hypothesized effects. The present review will focus on two approaches, leukoreduction and saline washing, as means to reduce adverse transfusion outcomes.

Abstract: Environmental rotenone is associated with Parkinson's disease due to its inhibitory property to the complex I of mitochondrial respiration chain. Although environmental pollution has been postulated as a causal factor for the increasing prevalence of obesity, the role of rotenone in the pathogenesis of obesity has not been studied. We employed muscle-derived cell C2C12 as a model and shotgun lipidomics as a tool for lipid analysis and found that treatment with rotenone led to the profound deposition of intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG) in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The TAG deposition resulted from complex I inhibition. Further studies revealed that rotenone induced mitochondrial stress as shown by decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, increased NADH/NAD+ ratio (i.e., reductive stress) and mitochondrial metabolites. We demonstrated that rotenone activated fatty acid de novo synthesis and TAG synthesis and ultimately resulted in intracellular TAG deposition. These studies suggested that increased mitochondrial stresses might be an underlying mechanism responsible for TAG accumulation manifest in obesity.

Abstract: A novel model based on the thermodynamic principles is developed to predict the eutectic temperature and composition in molten salt systems. In pursuit of novel low melting point molten salt mixtures with high thermal storage density for concentrating solar power generation, a new quaternary eutectic system comprising of lithium nitrate, sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate and sodium nitrite was developed. The thermodynamic model based on regular solution approximation was used to predict the eutectic composition and temperature in the LiNO3–NaNO3–KNO3–NaNO2 quaternary salt system. The result obtained for eutectic point of the LiNO3–NaNO3–KNO3–NaNO2 quaternary system was T=98.6°C and XLiNO3=0.215, XNaNO3=0.142, XKNO3=0.424, and XNaNO2=0.219. The calculated eutectic composition obtained from the thermodynamic model was verified experimentally for the eutectic temperature using the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) technique. Melting temperature of 99.02°C was obtained from the heating cycles. The experimentally determined melting temperature of the eutectic composition was in excellent agreement with that of calculated eutectic temperature of the system.

Abstract: The sensitivity of cadmium stannate (CTO) performance to both sputtering and annealing conditions was investigated. Films treated by the standard proximity anneal in contact with a CdS film displayed an electrical resistivity of ~2.2×10−4Ωcm, high mobility (~57cm2/Vs), and >90% transmission throughout the near infrared (λ≤1350nm). Film properties were insensitive to annealing temperature and sputtering ambient when O2 was present during deposition. Next, we demonstrated process modifications to the proximity anneal. CTO and CTO/CdS bilayer films were annealed either uncovered or covered with a bare glass plate. CTO/CdS bilayers annealed in the covered configuration had comparable or superior conductivity to the proximity anneal, with optimal performance achieved with 10nm of CdS. The resistivity of uncovered films and films produced without CdS was insensitive to CdS thickness (~3×10−4Ωcm), and displayed higher mobility and improved transparency, particularly in the near infrared. The electrical properties were well correlated with X-ray diffraction measurements of film crystallinity and purity. These high-conductivity films are promising for photovoltaic applications, transmitting 92–95% of solar radiation >1eV.

Abstract: The purpose of this pilot was to assess the tolerability and efficacy of ambroxol as a pharmacological chaperone in patients with symptomatic, type 1 Gaucher disease who present with measurable disease parameters but are not receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in order to provide proof of concept and/or ascertain the suitability of ambroxol for a larger clinical trial. The Israeli Ministry of Health Form 29c was employed to prescribe ambroxol for off-label use. Twelve patients were dispensed 2 capsules of 75mg of ambroxol daily for 6months. There were 8 females (66.7%). Mean age at entry was 41.1 (range: 24–63) years. Mean body weight at entry was 66.4 (range: 46.5–100) kg. One patient withdrew because of a hypersensitivity reaction, one because of elective splenectomy. No patient experienced clinically relevant deterioration in disease parameters measured. One patient achieved a robust response relative to baseline: +16.2% hemoglobin; +32.9% platelets; −2.8% liver volume; and −14.4% spleen volume. Three patients, including the above one, elected to continue on ambroxol for a further 6months: hemoglobin levels and liver volumes were relatively stable, but platelet counts further increased in the above patient (+52.6% from baseline) and spleen volumes decreased further in all three patients (−6.4%, −18.6%, and −23.4% from baseline). Thus, ambroxol may be a safe option for Gaucher disease patients with potential disease-specific efficacy and should be expanded into a clinical trial using higher doses and placebo-controlled design.

Abstract: The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway mediates the high-glucose-induced lipid accumulation in the renal tubular cells in diabetes. Studies have revealed that the downstream target genes of phospho-Akt, BCL2-associated death promoter (Bad) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) are associated with lipid accumulation in hepatic cells and preadipocytes. In the present study, it was revealed that the phospho-Akt, phospho-Bad, phosphor-GSK-3β contents and lipogenesis were increased in the renal tubular cells of diabetic rats. However, in high-glucose-treated human renal tubular cells, only the phospho-GSK-3β content increased without an alteration in the phospho-Bad content, which could be reversed by treatment with a short hairpin RNA vector aimed at Akt. Inhibiting GSK-3β activity using TWS119 increased the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) content and lipogenesis in renal tubular cells. Furthermore, the exogenous expression of wild-type GSK-3β enhanced the level of phospho-GSK-3β in high-glucose-stimulated renal tubular cells, followed by increased SREBP-1 expression and lipogenesis. Moreover, exogenous expression of mutant GSK-3β (via vector S9A) prevented the increase in SREBP-1 expression and cellular lipogenesis by decreasing the phospho-GSK-3β content and increasing the GSK-3β activity in high-glucose-treated cells. These data suggested that phospho-GSK-3β is involved in the high-glucose-mediated increase of SREBP-1 expression and triglyceride content in renal tubular cells in diabetes.

Abstract: We report on transparent stand alone C60 top electrodes for small molecule based organic photovoltaic cells. All device layers (including bottom and top electrode) are thermally evaporated in vacuum, guaranteeing fast, reliable, high-purity and low-cost processing. Employing an organic compound as electrode avoids refractive index mismatch between contact and photo-active layer which results in an increased number of photons reaching the absorber layers. The conductivity of C60 is improved from 10−8S/cm to remarkable 4.97S/cm by optimized molecular n-type doping. Furthermore, it is shown that high doping concentrations change the absorption behavior of C60, leading to transmittance values over 70% for wavelengths larger than 600nm with a weak dependence on layer thickness. Organic solar cells employing such an optimized n-doped C60 top electrode (thickness 200nm, doping concentration 16wt%) exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 1.53%. Electrical device simulations based on a discretized equivalent circuit model reveal an efficient lateral charge transport in n-doped C60 electrodes over a few 100µm. In combination with a supporting grid electrode (usually employed for large area photovoltaic applications), n-doped C60 might replace ITO and fill the lack of transparent conductive top electrodes required for roll-to-roll processed semi-transparent organic devices or devices on opaque substrates.

Abstract: We screened 423 patients referred to our laboratory after hemolysis triggered by fava beans ingestion, neonatal jaundice or drug hemolysis. Others were asymptomatic but belonged to a family with a history of G6PD deficiency. The determination of enzymatic activity using spectrophotometric method, revealed 293 deficient (143 males and 150 females). The molecular analysis was performed by a combination of PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing to characterize the mutations causing G6PD deficiency. 14 different genotypes have been identified : G6PD A− (376A>G;202G>A) (46.07%) and G6PD Med (33.10%) were the most common variants followed by G6PD Santamaria (5.80%), G6PD Kaiping (3.75%), the association [c.1311T and IVS11 93c] (3.75%), G6PD Chatham (2.04%), G6PD Aures (1.70%), G6PD A− Betica (0.68%), the association [ 376G;c.1311T;IVS11 93c] (0.68%), G6PD Malaga, G6PD Canton and G6PD Abeno respectively (0.34%). Two novel missense mutations were identified (c.920A>C: p.307Gln>Pro and c.968T>C: p.323 Leu>Pro). We designated these two class III variants as G6PD Tunis and G6PD Nefza. A mechanism which could account for the defective activity is discussed.

Abstract: Introduction
Research has implied that the immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of MDS and that T-cells are reacting to tumour antigen present on the surface of the malignant cells. This could imply that the immune system could be utilized to generate immune based therapy. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of studying this further by analysing the interaction of dendritic cells with T-cells in a small cohort of MDS patients.
Methods
Dendritic cells were generated in 6 MDS patients and 9 controls by culturing monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4. After activation with LPS and TNFα, the dendritic cells were analyzed for expression of co-stimulatory and activation antigens. Thereafter, they were co-cultured with T-cells and the T-cell response was examined by measuring the % change in expression of the activation antigen CD69.
Results
MDS MoDC had reduced expression of HLA-DR (p=0.006), CD11c (p=0.0004), CD80 (p=0.03) and CD86 (p=0.003), while resting T-cells from MDS patients had higher expression of the activation antigen CD69 on all subsets. The % change in CD69 expression increased significantly for both the control and MDS T-cells after co-culture with allogeneic dendritic cells, however this change was lower in the MDS group. Despite the increased CD69 expression prior to culture, MDS MoDC significantly up-regulated CD69 expression on autologous T-cells to values that were statistically higher than control cells.
Conclusion
This initial study suggests that the T-cells in MDS are able to respond to dendritic cells and are therefore probably not part of the malignant clone. It further implies that the dendritic cell population could be capable of presenting antigen and initiating an immune response and therefore further study is both feasible and warranted.

Abstract: Chondrogenic differentiation of human embryonic (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has been achieved in embryoid bodies (EBs) by adding selected growth factors to the medium. Also chondrocyte-secreted factors have been considered to promote the chondrogenic differentiation. Hence, we studied whether co-culture with primary chondrocytes can induce hESCs or hiPSCs to differentiate into chondrocyte lineage. Co-culture of hESCs or hiPSCs was established in a transwell insert system in feeder-free culture conditions, while hESCs or hiPSCs grown alone in the wells were used as controls. After 3-week co-culture with weekly replenished chondrocytes, the chondrogenically committed cells (hCCCs) were evaluated by morphology, immunocytochemistry, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and analysis of chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation markers. The expressions of chondrocyte- and pluripotency-associated genes were frequently measured during the monolayer expansion of hCCCs from passage 1 to 10. Human CCCs displayed morphology similar to chondrocytes, and expressed chondrocyte-associated genes, which were declined following passaging, similarly to passaged chondrocytes. They also formed a chondrogenic cell pellet, and differentiated into chondrocytic cells, which secreted abundant extracellular matrix. Human CCCs also proliferated rapidly. However, they did not show osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation capacity. Our results show that co-culture of hESCs or hiPSCs with primary chondrocytes could induce specific chondrogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Poly [3,3‴-didodecylquaterselenophene] (PQS) and poly[3,3‴-didodecylquaterselenophene-alt-didodecylquaterthiophene] (PQSQT), have been synthesized by using a Stille cross-coupling reaction. The weight-averaged molecular weights (Mw) of PQS and PQSQT were found to be 18,900Da and 22,300Da with polydispersity indices of 1.71 and 1.99, respectively. Photophysical measurements found the low bandgaps of 1.73eV for PQS and 1.86eV for PQSQT. The field-effect mobilities of PQS and PQSQT were determined to be 6.0×10−3 and 0.05cm2/Vs, respectively. The influence of the selenium and sulfur atoms in the polymer backbones were investigated with regard to device performances. The polymers were combined with the PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) acceptor to fabricate bulk heterojunction solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 0.73–2.37% under AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) conditions.

Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) p-i-n solar cells were grown in a single, non-load-locked chamber by using 13.56MHz plasma. Residual air impurities were controlled with high vacuum pumping, or not controlled, and the concentrations were measured at the onset, before p-layer deposition. The low pressures (approximately 10−7–10−8Torr) of N2 and O2 near the lowest vacuum pressure of the chamber, incorporated base contamination levels of nitrogen and oxygen (approximately 1018–1019atoms/cm3). High pressures of H2O (10−5–10−6Torr) resulted in extremely high oxygen contamination levels (approximately 1021atoms/cm3), which was the dominant residual impurity. High concentration un-stabilized H2O showed a rapidly decreasing rate which induced non-uniform oxygen doping and resulted in a non-uniform distribution of the internal electric field in the i-layer. The net loss (ΔQE(0,V)) of quantum efficiency (QE) of the cells between zero and a forward bias showed the increase of QE loss in the long-wavelength region for increasing forward bias resulted in poor performance of the low fill factor and energy conversion efficiency, and a high series resistance of the cells. The removal of residual water vapor from the chamber is a key factor in improving the performance of a-Si:H solar cells.

Abstract: Administration of β2-agonists triggers skeletal muscle anabolism and hypertrophy. We investigated the time course of the molecular events responsible for rat skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to 1, 3 and 10 days of formoterol administration (i.p. 2000μg/kg/day). A marked hypertrophy of rat tibialis anterior muscle culminated at day 10. Phosphorylation of Akt, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1 and ERK1/2 was increased at day 3, but returned to control level at day 10. This could lead to a transient increase in protein translation and could explain previous studies that reported increase in protein synthesis following β2-agonist administration. Formoterol administration was also associated with a significant reduction in MAFbx/atrogin-1 mRNA level (day 3), suggesting that formoterol can also affect protein degradation of MAFbx/atrogin1 targeted substrates, including MyoD and eukaryotic initiation factor-3f (eIF3-f). Surprisingly, mRNA level of autophagy-related genes, light chain 3 beta (LC3b) and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (Gabarapl1), as well as lysosomal hydrolases, cathepsin B and cathepsin L, was significantly and transiently increased after 1 and/or 3 days, suggesting that autophagosome formation would be increased in response to formoterol administration. However, this has to be relativized since the mRNA level of Unc-51-like kinase1 (Ulk1), BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein3 (Bnip3), and transcription factor EB (TFEB), as well as the protein content of Ulk1, Atg13, Atg5–Atg12 complex and p62/Sqstm1 remained unchanged or was even decreased in response to formoterol administration. These results demonstrate that the effects of formoterol are mediated, in part, through the activation of Akt-mTOR pathway and that other signaling pathways become more important in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass with chronic administration of β2-agonists.

Abstract: Early growth response 2 (Egr2) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that acts as an important modulator of a variety of physiological processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Here we showed that Egr2 was downregulated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways during the commitment of C3H10T1/2 stem cells to adipocyte lineage. Overexpression of Egr2 completely prevented BMP4-induced adipocyte lineage commitment of C3H10T1/2 stem cells, while simultaneously stimulating early smooth muscle-like differentiation. We also demonstrated that Egr2-induced early smooth muscle-like differentiation is transforming growth factor β1-independent. Egr2 can activate the transcription of early smooth muscle cell specific genes smooth muscle protein 22α and calponin 1. Together, the results indicated a novel role for Egr2 in repressing adipocyte lineage commitment and promoting early smooth muscle-like cell differentiation.

Abstract: Dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC) technology has seen some radical advancement recently owing to the new materials and device structure innovations. The efficiency increase in the solid state version of DSSCs from about 5% to over 15% have been reported within two years of time scale, which comes mainly from the efforts in the perovskites based mesoporous solar cells developments. This has increased its potential significantly to become a low cost alternative for commercially available solar cell technologies. The progress of the liquid junction based DSSCs towards their better performance and stability had been relatively slower and was coupled with scale up and engineering challenges such as encapsulation, sealing of the device, etc. The efficiency figures for conventional DSSCs had been staying stagnant for almost two decades although many research groups had been concentrating to improve the efficiency of DSSC through various ways. The recent developments on the solid state DSSCs have given a solid belief for this technology to make a mark towards its commercialisation. Although a great progress in the device efficiency has been made but a lot of efforts are still needed to break the barriers which had been preventing this from penetrating the market. An attempt has been made through this article to report the recent developments in the liquid junction, quasi and solid state versions of the DSSC technology with their state of the art efficiency figures reflecting their current status.

Abstract: Aim
To investigate the genotype–phenotype correlation in Romanian patients treated with acenocoumarol.
Material and methods
We studied 301 consecutive patients who required treatment with acenocoumarol, admitted within the Municipal Hospital of Cluj-Napoca and the Heart Institute “Niculae Stănciou” in Cluj-Napoca over a 3-year period. For each patient we recorded clinical parameters which could interfere with the achievement of stable therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). We performed genetic analysis which consisted of genotyping the CYP2C9 gene and the VKORC1 gene. Patients were divided in three groups according to the acenocoumarol dose needed to reach a stable INR: the low dose group (≤7mg/week), the medium dose group (>7mg and <28mg/week) and the high acenocoumarol dose group (>28mg/week).
Results
We found that patients' age was significantly different between groups (p<0.001). No differences existed between groups regarding the pathologies which required anticoagulation therapy or the concomitant treatment. The following parameters increased the odds of receiving a low dose of acenocoumarol: patient's age over 65years (OR, 3.2; p=0.01; 95%CI: 1.24–8.25), the presence of the CYP2C9*3 allele (OR, 3.4; p=0.006; 95%CI: 1.41–8.34), and the GA or AA genotype of c.-1639G>A polymorphism of VKORC1 (OR, 6.5; p=0.01; 95%CI: 1.38–30.5; respectively OR, 11.6; p=0.003; 95%CI: 2.26–59.58). A high acenocoumarol dose was less likely to be administered to an elderly patient (OR, 0.24; p=0.001; 95%CI: 0.1–0.56) or to a patient with the GA or AA genotype (OR, 0.2; p<0.001; 95CI%: 0.09–0.45; respectively OR, 0.05; p=0.006; 95%CI: 0.007–0.43).
Conclusion
The stable therapeutic dose of acenocoumarol is dependent of patient's age, the presence of the CYP2C9*3 allele and the c.-1639G>A polymorphism of VKORC1.

Abstract: We analyzed the draft genome of the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae (B. floridae) for genes encoding intermediate filament (IF) proteins. From 26 identified IF genes 13 were not reported before. Four of the new IF genes belong to the previously established Branchiostoma IF group A, four to the Branchiostoma IF group B, one is homologous to the type II keratin E2 while the remaining four new IF sequences N1 to N4 could not be readily classified in any of the previously established Branchiostoma IF groups. All eleven identified A and B2-type IF genes are located on the same genomic scaffold and arose due to multiple cephalochordate-specific duplications. Another IF gene cluster, identified in the B. floridae genome, contains three keratins (E1, Y1, D1), two keratin-like IF genes (C2, X1), one new IF gene (N1) and one IF unrelated gene, but does not show any similarities to the well defined vertebrate type I or type II keratin gene clusters. In addition, some type III sequence features were documented in the new IF protein N2, which, however, seems to share a common ancestry with the Branchiostoma keratins D1 and two keratin-related genes C. Thus, a few type I and type II keratin genes existed in a common ancestor of cephalochordates and vertebrates, which after separation of these two lineages gave rise to the known complexities of the vertebrate cytoplasmic type I–IV IF proteins, as well as to the multiple keratin and related IF genes in cephalochordates, due to multiple gene duplications, deletions and sequence divergences.

Abstract: We report a series of neonates who developed a total serum bilirubin (TSB) >20mg/dL during a recent ten-year period in a multihospital healthcare system. The incidence of a TSB >20mg/dL fell after instituting a pre-hospital discharge bilirubin screening program in 2003/2004 (91.3 cases/10,000 births before vs. 72.4/10,000 after), but the incidence has subsequently remained unchanged. No specific cause for the hyperbilirubinemia was identified in 66% of (n=32) cases with a TSB >30mg/dL or in 76% of (n=112) cases with a TSB 25.0–29.9mg/dL. We hypothesized that hemolysis was a common contributing mechanism, but our review of hospital records indicated that in most instances these infants were not evaluated sufficiently to test this hypothesis. Records review showed maternal and neonatal blood types and direct antiglobulin testing were performed in >95% cases, but rarely were other tests for hemolysis obtained. In the ten-year period reviewed there were zero instances where erythrocyte morphology from a blood film examination or Heinz body evaluation by a pediatric hematologist or pathologist were performed. In 3% of cases pyruvate kinase was tested, 3% were evaluated by hemoglobin electrophoresis, 3% had a haptoglobin measurement, and 16% were tested for G6PD deficiency. Thus, determining the cause for hyperbilirubinemia in neonates remains a problem at Intermountain Healthcare and, we submit, elsewhere. As a result, the majority of infants with a TSB >25mg/dL have no specific causation identified. We speculate that most of these cases involve hemolysis and that the etiology could be identified if searched for more systematically. With this in mind, we propose a “consistent approach” to evaluating the cause(s) of hyperbilirubinemia among neonates with a TSB >25mg/dL.

Abstract: Efficient inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with ZnO electron transport layers (ETLs) prepared by spray pyrolysis, which is a simple and cost efficient method producing a thin oxide layer by direct spray of precursor on hot substrate. To investigate the effect of substrate temperature on the structural and optical properties as well as performance of PSCs, ZnO ETLs were fabricated by spray pyrolysis on hot substrate controlled at 150, 250, and 350°C, respectively. The PSC with ZnO prepared by spray pyrolysis at 150°C exhibited poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.94% due to the mis-matched energy level and microscopic roughness of ZnO ETL. On the other hand, enhanced efficiency of 2.99% and 3.22% was obtained by using ZnO prepared by spray pyrolysis at 250 and 350°C, respectively. Enhancement of efficiency at higher temperature is attributed to better matching of ZnO coated ITO work-function with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of PCBM and the formation of smooth and homogeneous polycrystalline ZnO, resulting in improved interfacial property and electron transport. In the durability test, inverted ZnO solar cell was retained above 80% during 9 days in an ambient atmosphere without any encapsulation, while conventional solar cells showed dramatic decrease of efficiency.

Abstract: Chitotriosidase is an enzyme secreted by activated macrophages and a useful biomarker in several lysosomal and nonlysosomal diseases. However, chitotriosidase gene (CHIT1) mutations may lead to inaccuracy in the significance of this biomarker. Reports on the molecular spectrum of genetic variation in chitotriosidase are rare, and this is one of the few that focus on a specific population group. In this work we assessed the variation of CHIT1 mutations in ten normal controls and detected six missense alterations. G102S, a polymorphism with known altered catalytic properties, was the most frequent being detected in 4/10 individuals. Using allelic discrimination we tested 503 individuals, randomly sampled from the Portuguese population. Variant G102S was detected in 49.5% of the individuals and presented an allele frequency of 0.29. The results of this study showed that variability in CHIT1 gene is considerable and that G102S polymorphism presents a high frequency in the Portuguese.

Abstract: RhoB is the only member of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases, which is classified as an immediate early gene product. RhoB is up-regulated in response to growth factors as well as cytotoxic and genotoxic agents. Clostridial glucosylating toxins have been reported to evoke pronounced RhoB expression, based on the inactivation of Rho/Ras proteins. In this study, we report on a long lasting expression of RhoB in cultured cells upon activation of Rho proteins by the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) from Escherichia coli. The observations of this study highlight a new pathway involving Rac1, which positively regulates the activity of the rhoB promoter and RhoB expression. Conversely, the isomeric cytotoxic necrotizing factor from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (CNFy) drives GTP-loading of basal RhoB but fails to cause activation of the rhoB promoter and thus its expression. CNF1 inhibits cytokinesis and induces the formation of bi-nucleated (tetraploid) cells. Upon long term treatment with CNF1, RhoB−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and loss of membrane integrity, while RhoB+/− MEFs persist as bi-nucleated (tetraploid) cells without any signs of cell death. In conclusion, the cytoprotective RhoB response is not only evoked by bacterial protein toxins inactivating Rho/Ras proteins but also by the Rac1-activating toxin CNF1.

Abstract: We demonstrate response and lifetime improvements for organic photovoltaic (OPV) by using organic bathophenanthroline (Bphen) and inorganic molybdenum oxide (MoO3) as a compound cathode buffer layer (CBL). Not only power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases by 27% but also working and storage lifetimes extend at least 10 and 60 times respectively comparing with PV cell with 5nm thick Bphen as CBL. The optimized PV structure is ITO/CuPc (20nm)/C60 (40nm)/Bphen (2nm)/MoO3 (5nm)/Al and the CBL of the reference device is 5nm Bphen without MoO3 layer. The achievement of PV performance and lifetime improvement by introducing such a compound CBL is attributed to appropriate level alignment between C60, Bphen and MoO3, and stable inorganic MoO3 can prevent from superior oxygen and moisture diffusion into the C60 acceptor layer. The detailed working mechanism of the compound Bphen/MoO3 CBL in the OPV cells is also argued.

Abstract: Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are the two most common myeloproliferative neoplasms. The same JAK2V617F mutation can be found in both disorders and is able to recapitulate many of the phenotypic abnormalities of these diseases in the murine models. The disease phenotype is also influenced by other unknown genetic or epigenetic factors. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are 18–24 nucleotides single-stranded non-protein-coding RNAs that function primarily as gene repressors by binding to their target messenger RNAs. We performed miRNA expression profiling by oligonucleotide microarray analysis in purified peripheral blood CD34+ cells from eight JAK2V617F-positive PV patients and six healthy donors. A quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was used to verify differential miRNA expression. Since erythrocytosis is the only feature that distinguishes PV from ET, we also compared specific miRNA expression in the nucleated erythroid cells directly descended from the early erythroid progenitor cells of PV and ET patients. Our data indicate that significant miRNA deregulation occurs in PV CD34+ cells and confirm a genetic basis for the gender-specific differences that characterize PV with respect to miRNA. The results of our study also suggest that deregulated miRNAs may represent an important mechanism by which the PV erythrocytosis and ET thrombocytosis phenotypes are determined.

Abstract: The clinical and hematological course of β thalassemia intermedia is influenced by a number of genetic factors which play a role in increasing fetal haemoglobin levels. Several polymorphisms located in the promoters of β and γ globin gene are involved in influencing the disease severity. Our objective was to study the effect of cis-DNA haplotypes, motifs, or polymorphisms (Pre G γ globin gene haplotypes, Aγ–δ intergenic region haplotypes XmnI and (AT)x(T)y polymorphisms, β-LCR HS2 and HS3 site motifs) that may contribute to higher HbF levels and a milder clinical course. We found that a combination of T haplotype of the Aγ–δ intergenic region, TAG Pre-Gγ haplotype, presence of the XmnI polymorphism along with the (AT)9(T)5 motif constitutes a topography that co-relates with raised HbF levels which may contribute in ameliorating the disease severity.

Abstract: The p15Ink4b gene is frequently hypermethylated in myeloid neoplasia and has been demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor. Since it is a member of the INK4b family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, it was initially presumed that its loss in leukemic blasts caused a dysregulation of the cell cycle. However, animal model experiments over the last several years have produced a very different picture of how p15Ink4b functions in hematopoietic cells and how its loss contributes to myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloid leukemia. It is clear now, that in early hematopoietic progenitors, p15Ink4b functions outside of its canonical role as a cell cycle inhibitor. Its functions are involved in signal transduction and influence the development of erythroid, monocytic and dendritic cells.

Abstract: The α-globin genes were studied in nine families with unexplained hypochromic anaemia and in 167 patients with HbE β thalassaemia in Sri Lanka. As well as the common deletion forms of α+ thalassaemia three families from an ethnic minority were found to carry a novel form of α0 thalassaemia, one family carried a previously reported form of α0 thalassaemia, −−THAI, and five families had different forms of non-deletional thalassaemia. The patients with HbE β thalassaemia who had co-inherited α thalassaemia all showed an extremely mild phenotype and reduced levels of HbF and there was a highly significant paucity of α+ thalassaemia in these patients compared with the normal population. Extended α gene arrangements, including ααα, αααα and ααααα, occurred at a low frequency and were commoner in the more severe phenotypes of HbE β thalassaemia. As well as emphasising the ameliorating effect of α thalassaemia on HbE β thalassaemia the finding of a novel form of α0 thalassaemia in an ethnic minority, together with an unexpected diversity of forms of non-deletion α thalassaemia in Sri Lanka, further emphasises the critical importance of micro-mapping populations for determining the frequency of clinically important forms of the disease.

Abstract: Background and objectives
The role of bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) in leukaemic cell control is controversial. The purpose of this work was to evaluate BM-MSC role regarding the viability, proliferation and immunophenotype of normal B-cell precursors from control (Ct) patients and leukaemic cells from B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) patients.
Patients and methods
BM-MSC were isolated and characterised from voluntary donors. Mononuclear cells isolated from Ct and B-ALL bone marrow samples were cultured in the presence or absence of BM-MSC for 7days. Cell viability was determined with LIVE/DEAD and proliferation index evaluated by CFSE labelling. Cell population immunophenotypes were characterised by estimating CD19, CD10, CD20 and CD45 antigens by flow cytometry.
Results
After co-culture, B-ALL cells exhibited higher viability (20–40%) as compared to just cells (3–10%). Ct and B-ALL absolute cell counts were higher in the presence of BM-MSC (Ct: 25/mm3cf8/mm3, B-ALL: 15/mm3cf3/mm3). Normal B-cell subpopulations in co-culture had increased expression of CD19 and CD10 (Pre-pre B) and CD45 and CD20 antigens (Pre-B). B-ALL cells co-cultured with BM-MSC showed an increase in CD19 and CD20, although the greatest increase was observed in the CD10 antigen.
Conclusions
Lymphoid cell maintenance, at early stages of differentiation, was significantly promoted by BM-MSC in normal and leukaemic cells. Co-cultures also modulated the expression of antigens associated with the B-ALL asynchronous phenotype as CD10 co-expressed with CD19 and CD20. To our knowledge, this is the first time that CD10, CD19 and CD20 leukaemic antigens have been reported as being regulated by BM-MSC.

Abstract: TiO2@WO3 core/shell nanorod arrays are prepared by the combination of hydrothermal and electrodeposition method. The array films show remarkable enhancement of the electrochromic properties. In particular, a significant optical modulation (57.2% at 750nm, 70.3% at 1800nm and 38.4% at 10μm), fast switching speed (2.4s and 1.6s), high coloration efficiency (67.5cm2C−1 at 750nm) and excellent cycling performance (65.1% after 10,000 cycles) are achieved for the core/shell nanorod arrays. The improved electrochromic properties are mainly attributed to the core/shell structure and the porous space among the nanorod array, which makes the ion diffusion become easier and it also gives larger surface area for charge-transfer reactions. The data present great promise for the TiO2@WO3 core/shell nanorod arrays as practical electrochromic materials.

Abstract: High performance electrochromic electrodes prepared by the electrophoretic deposition of Au@PEDOT (gold@poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) nanoparticles were characterized. A detailed study was performed using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with a chemical analysis at the nanometer level showing core–shell structures with sizes ranging from 2 to 8nm. X-ray diffraction and Raman experiments were also performed. The modified electrodes present homogeneous surfaces with increased roughness, leading to excellent electrochromic properties like a high chromatic contrast with an electrochromic efficiency of ca. 300C−1cm2 with a response time of approximately 60–70ms for 90% of coloration. The fast switching was related to the location of the solid state electrochromic reaction, the very thin PEDOT layer surrounding the Au core of the nanoparticles.

Abstract: All-solution processed organic solar cells with a conventional device structure were demonstrated. The evaporated low work function LiF/Al electrode was replaced by a printed high work function silver electrode combined with an additional electron transport layer (ETL). Two electron transport layers were tested: (I) zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles and (II) poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9–dioctylfluorene)] (PFN). Devices with printed silver nanoparticle inks on top of the ZnO electron transport layer lead to crack formation in the silver layer during the drying and sintering. The crack formation was avoided by using PFN as electron transport layer. The sputtered high work function ITO electrode was substituted by a printed composite electrode containing inkjet-printed silver grids in combination with high conductivity poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). All-solution processed solar cells demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 1.94%.

Abstract: Generation of unbound nitric oxide (NO) via the oxidative denitrosylation (ODN) mechanism is proposed to involve the simultaneous reaction of nitrite with oxy and deoxy hemoglobin (Hb(O2) (k1) and Hb (k13)) to yield respectively, NO2 and Hb+2(NO). These two reaction pathways are coupled when NO2 reacts with Hb+2(NO) to yield Hb+3(NO) (k22), a species that releases NO rapidly. Here, I have constructed an experimentally based molecular model of the ODN mechanism (k1–k31), focusing on the high nitrite reductase activity of R-state hemoglobin. This model was used to test the hypothesis that human fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can generate unbound NO faster and to a greater extent than HbA, consequent to a 25-fold larger value of k1, which was determined in an earlier study. The results show that despite the use of identical values for k22, there was a 44-fold larger apparent rate of reaction of NO2 with HbF(NO) compared to HbA(NO), for reactions simulated at 410μM nitrite and 100μM hemoglobin (heme basis), 50% oxygen saturation at pH 7.4 and 37°C. This faster reaction was associated with the generation of about 11μM peak unbound NO. In contrast, HbA failed to generate unbound NO rapidly under the same conditions. However, raising the concentration of nitrite into the millimolar range did generate unbound NO in the HbA simulation, in agreement with the experimental literature, and that result was associated with acceleration in the rate of reaction of NO2 with HbA(NO). Unbound NO could be generated at 410μM nitrite in the HbA simulation by lowering the pH. This too was associated with an acceleration in the rate of reaction of NO2 with HbA(NO). Furthermore, generation of unbound NO could be assigned to the pH-dependent increase in k1, independent of the associated increase in k13. Finally, selective exchange of the HbA value of k1 for the HbF value, keeping all other constants and conditions unchanged, generated kinetic patterns for the various species of the “k1-modified” HbA simulation, which were virtually indistinguishable from those seen in the HbF simulation. Taken together, these findings show that rapid and extensive generation of unbound NO within the ODN mechanism is controlled by the value of k1. The faster and more extensive generation of unbound NO by HbF at micromolar nitrite concentration suggests a possible second function for HbF in sickle cell disease, namely enhanced vasodilation. The failure of 410μM nitrite to generate unbound NO in the HbA simulation at pH 7.4, contrasts with evidence in the literature showing that exposure of intact red cells to 100 to 200μM nitrite in PBS, promoted NO release into the gas phase. I point out that this difference in outcome may be due to the higher activity of HbA when bound to the cytoplasmic domain of the red cell membrane anion transport protein SLC4A1 (band 3) and to the demonstrated capacity of band 3 to transport nitrite.

Abstract: Since resveratrol is considered to exert a unique dual effect, protective for normal cells but toxic to tumor cells, its action on undifferentiated (original) and differentiated PC12 cells was analyzed, because undifferentiated cells are tumorigenic and differentiated ones are neuronal in nature. Compared to resveratrol-untreated cells in both undifferentiated and differentiated cell groups, cells treated with different doses of resveratrol, at dosages of 1, 10 and 100μM, showed the following alterations. Dying/dead cells were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in undifferentiated cells, but they were unchanged at doses of up to 10μM resveratrol in differentiated cells. In living cells, neurites were short in undifferentiated cells, but drastically elongated with an increased number in differentiated cells. The expression of SIRT1 was drastically reduced in undifferentiated cells, but stable in differentiated cells. SIRT3 was significantly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner at resveratrol doses of up to 10μM in both cells, with reduction and more enhanced at a dosage of 100μM in undifferentiated and differentiated cells, respectively. Mitochondrial number and ATP synthase β subunit expression was unaltered at doses of up to 10μM and were significantly reduced at doses of 100μM in undifferentiated cells, but they were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, with a slight reduction in the ATP synthase at doses of 100μM, in differentiated cells. In a dose-dependent manner, the number of autophagosomes and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were significantly less in undifferentiated cells and greater in differentiated cells. Also, in a dose-dependent manner, the expression of phosphorylated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) was significantly less in undifferentiated cells and greater in differentiated cells. Resveratrol-induced AMPK suppression and activation, possibly through the modulation of SIRT protein activity, may thus be related to the inhibition and promotion of mitochondrial and autophagic functions, leading to cell death and survival in undifferentiated and differentiated cells, respectively.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are important for the stability and function of cell proteins and thus for cell survival under physiological as well as stress conditions. Hsps were also reported to play an important role in tumorogenesis including leukemias. In this study we followed up Hsp70 and 90 protein levels in samples from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to evaluate these Hsps with regard to their ability to characterize the disease status and disease prognosis. We analyzed 68 samples of total leukocytes of CML patients with different response to therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The results of Western blot analyses showed that the level of Hsp70 did not change in the course of the disease and did not correlate with response to therapy. In contrast, Hsp90 levels showed good correlation with the disease state. Patients with good response to therapy (major molecular response—MMR, molecular remission—CMR) had low expression levels of Hsp90, similar to those in healthy individuals. High Hsp90 levels were found in patients with resistance to therapy (hematological relapse—HR, accelerated phase or blast crisis), and in leukemic cell line K562. The results of the study suggested that not the kinetics but the particular level of Hsp90 at any time point since therapy start is of prognostic value: Hsp90 level above 0.27 significantly predicted poor response to TKI therapy (relapse, progression) and the level below 0.085 good response (MMR, CMR). In conclusion, Hsp90 level in total leukocytes could serve as a risk factor at diagnosis as well as during therapy and might help in clinical decision making especially in cases where BCR-ABL monitoring is of low predictive value. Our data suggest that high expression of HSP90 contributes to the aggressivity of the disease and should be considered as an important target for specialized CML therapy.

Abstract: Here we report highlights of discussions and results presented at an International Workshop on Concepts and Models of Stem Cell Organization held on July 16th and 17th, 2012 in Dresden, Germany. The goal of the workshop was to undertake a systematic survey of state-of-the-art methods and results of clonality studies of tissue regeneration and maintenance with a particular emphasis on the hematopoietic system. The meeting was the 6th in a series of similar conceptual workshops, termed StemCellMathLab,22Previous StemCellMathLabs were held in 2001, 2005, 2007 (Leipzig, Germany), 2008 [1] (London, UK), and 2010 [2] (Dresden, Germany). all of which have had the general objective of using an interdisciplinary approach to discuss specific aspects of stem cell biology. The StemCellMathLab 2012, which was jointly organized by the Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden University of Technology and the Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, brought together 32 scientists from 8 countries, with scientific backgrounds in medicine, cell biology, virology, physics, computer sciences, bioinformatics and mathematics. The workshop focused on the following questions: (1) How heterogeneous are stem cells and their progeny? and (2) What are the characteristic differences in the clonal dynamics between physiological and pathophysiological situations? In discussing these questions, particular emphasis was placed on (a) the methods for quantifying clones and their dynamics in experimental and clinical settings and (b) general concepts and models for their description. In this workshop summary we start with an introduction to the current state of clonality research and a proposal for clearly defined terminology. Major topics of discussion include clonal heterogeneity in unperturbed tissues, clonal dynamics due to physiological and pathophysiological pressures and conceptual and technical issues of clone quantification. We conclude that an interactive cross-disciplinary approach to research in this field will continue to promote a conceptual understanding of tissue organization.

Abstract: Introduction
We evaluated a novel approach for investigation of lymphocyte dysregulation in Gaucher patients by including determination of IgH and TCR gene rearrangements together with levels of immunoglobulins, natural autoantibodies as well as presence of monoclonal protein.
Materials and methods
Measurement of serum immunoglobulins, monoclonal immunoglobulins, selected autoantibodies, as well as analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain and T cell receptor gene rearrangements.
Results
Immunoglobulin disorder was detected in 29.6% patients, 40.7% demonstrated presence of B cell clonality and 44.4% demonstrated presence of autoantibodies. In five patients in our series, the presence of IgH gene rearrangement was the only detectable indicator of B cell dysfunction. TCR gene rearrangements were not found in any of the patients.
Conclusion
Based on our results, we propose IgH gene rearrangements as a new biomarker for investigation of B cell dysfunction occurring as a complication of Gaucher disease.

Abstract: The metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI-1, which is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, has been proposed to exert its activity together with glycosphingolipids. However, the mechanism of CD82 inhibition has not been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the synergistic inhibition of cell migration by the tetraspanin CD82 and gangliosides and to correlate this inhibition with activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR/cMet) in Hepa1-6 cell lines, whose motility and migration is stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in vitro. We found that Hepa1-6 cells transfected with the CD82 gene exhibited decreased migration in response to EGF and HGF. EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr1173 was inhibited in these cells, which contributed to the attenuation of EGFR. Ectopic expression of CD82 in Hepa1-6 cells inhibited HGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of cMet at Tyr1313 and Tyr1365 without affecting the expression of cMet. These inhibitory effects were enhanced when CD82 was introduced with Ganglioside GM3 alone or GM2/GM3. Reduction of CD82 expression by RNA interference together with depletion of glycosphingolipids with P4 significantly enhanced cell motility and increased the expression of EGFR and its phosphorylation at Tyr1173 in response to EGF. Increased cell motility and HGF-dependent activation of cMet at Tyr1313 and Tyr1365 resulted from decreased CD82 levels and increased GM3. Furthermore, CD82 expression selectively attenuated EGFR and cMet signalling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt but had no affect on the activity of the MAPK signalling pathway. These results suggest that the synergistic effects of CD82 and GM3 or GM2/GM3 on EGFR expression and phosphorylation and cMet activation are responsible for CD82 inhibition of EGF- and HGF-dependent cell motility and migration of Hepa1-6 cells.

Abstract: Routine coagulation tests on a 14year-old male with frequent epistaxis showed a prolonged thrombin time together with diminished functional (162mg/dl) and gravimetric (122mg/dl) fibrinogen concentrations. His father showed similar aberrant results and sequencing of the three fibrinogen genes revealed a novel heterozygous nonsense mutation in the FGB gene c.1105C>T, which converts the codon for residue Bβ 339Q to stop, causing deletion of Bβ chain residues 339–461. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and RP-HPLC (reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography) of purified fibrinogen showed only normal Aα, Bβ, and γ chains, indicating that molecules with the truncated 37,990Da β chain were not secreted into plasma. Functional analysis showed impaired fibrin polymerization, fibrin porosity, and elasticity compared to controls. By laser scanning confocal microscopy the patient's fibers were slightly thinner than normal. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) presented normal sialylation of the oligosaccharide chains, and liver function tests showed no evidence of liver dysfunction that might explain the functional abnormalities.

Abstract: Paraffin/carbon foam composite phase change material (PCM) was prepared with vacuum assistance in the present study, and the structure and thermo-physical properties of the composite PCM were studied. The impregnation ratios were studied comparatively for the cases with and without vacuum assistance, and the results showed that the impregnation process with vacuum assistance was superior to that without vacuum assistance. Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) technique was used to investigate the inner structural characteristics of the composite PCM. The gray value analysis was conducted, and two dimensional (2D) cross-section images and three dimensional (3D) renderings were constructed accordingly. Both the surface porosity and bulk porosity were obtained from the image analysis. Compared with pure paraffin, the thermal conductivity of the composite PCM was enhanced, e.g., the composite PCM with vacuum assistance was about three times larger than that of pure paraffin. The measured thermal conductivity showed agreement with the theoretical models. The phase change behaviors of the composite PCM were investigated with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The presence of the porous carbon foam affected the phase change behavior of pure paraffin in that the extrapolated onset melting/freezing temperatures shifted from 52.10/60.56°C for pure paraffin to 51.73/61.16°C. The thermal effusivity of the composite PCM was larger than that of pure paraffin, which was apparently advantageous for latent thermal energy storage (LTES).

Abstract: Polyethylene (PE) mesh is shown to strongly suppress convective gain at night and to have a high black body transmittance, making it suited to use in radiative cooling. Advantages over previous non-porous cover systems include; self-supporting for large areas, good mechanical stability, low cost, retractable, and a long outdoor lifetime. This study compares performance with a PE mesh cover to that of an impermeable PE cover and to no cover. Convective suppression and net cooling for different wind speeds and ambient temperatures are examined. The impact of such a mesh on night sky cooling rates for a mesh over water, then over a roof is presented. For the roof the associated rise in surface temperature is also measured and modelled in the daytime. Effective permeabilities are not the same as geometric permeability. They are extracted by comparing simulation results with data and are found to depend only weakly on wind speed. They are most sensitive to magnitude and sign of the difference between roof and ambient temperatures. They differ significantly between night and day, that is for convective warming and cooling respectively.

Abstract: XK is a putative transporter of unknown function that is ubiquitously expressed and linked through disulfide bonds to Kell protein, an endothelin-3 (ET-3)-converting enzyme. We generated three knockout (KO) mice that lacked either Xk, Kell or both proteins and characterized erythrocyte cation levels, transport and hematological parameters. Absence of Xk or Kell was accompanied by changes in erythrocyte K+, Mg2+, Na+ and Ca2+ transport that were associated with changes in mean cellular volume and corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mean. Baseline Ca2+-ATPase activity was undetected in erythrocytes from all three mouse types but was restored upon pre-incubation with ET-3. Consistent with these alterations in Ca2+ handling, we observed increased Gardos channel activity in Kel and Xk KO mice. In addition Kel deletion was associated with increased Mg2+ permeability while Xk deletion blocked Na/Mg exchanger activity. Our results provide evidence that cellular divalent cation regulation is functionally coupled to the Kell/XK system in erythrocytes and loss of this complex may contribute to acanthocytosis formation in McLeod syndrome.

Abstract: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is one of the most common hematologic malignancies in Western countries. Accumulation of leukemic lymphocytes in peripheral blood, bone marrow and secondary lymphatic organs of CLL patients is due to decreased apoptosis rather than to increased proliferation. The former is driven by signals from a specific microenvironment, created by stromal cells of mesenchymal origin, follicular dendritic cells, T lymphocytes and others. Nurse-like cells (NLCs) were first described to differentiate from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CLL patients in vitro, then they have been also found in proliferation centers of their lymphatic tissues. Like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in solid tumors, nurse-like cells promote survival of CLL lymphocytes. NLC gene expression patterns suggest their similarity to TAMs and differ between patients depending on ZAP70 protein expression status. NLC number in vitro corresponds with CD14 expressing cell count and beta-2-microglobulin serum level, and positively correlates with leukemic lymphocyte viability. As NLCs strongly express genes for adhesion molecules and secrete chemokines of antiapoptotic activity, they should be considered as a target for anti-microenvironment therapy of this incurable disease.

Abstract: One of the limitations for the widespread use of solar water disinfection technologies in developing regions is the lack of low-cost clean water sensors. A new type of low-cost sensors using photovoltaic solar cells that provide information about received irradiance, temperature, UV irradiance and sunshine duration is presented. A key aspect of the design is the UV irradiance measurement. Two identical cells are used, one of them with a low-cost UV-blocking filter on top, so the total UV irradiance can be calculated as the difference between the two solar cells outputs. The first cell would be measuring UV–vis–NIR and the second only vis–NIR. The UV filter material was explored and a low-cost architectural film was selected. Materials costs for the first prototype were of approximately 4€ excluding labour. Initial testing also included experiments with real polluted water and Escherichia coli, showing the feasibility of the new design.

Abstract: Pyrite iron disulfide (FeS2) is an earth-abundant and environmentally benign semiconductor with low procurement costs and advantageous optoelectronic properties for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Here, pyrite FeS2 nanocrystals (NCs) synthesized with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) additives are deployed in ternary hybrid bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with an inverted architecture. The band gap (Eg) of the NCs is estimated to be 1.3 and 1.7eV using UV–vis–NIR absorption and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. A dramatic increase of the oxidized iron species in the NCs is shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which may cause the elevated Eg, according to recent density functional theory calculations. Three device performance regimes are observed when the pyrite NC concentration is varied from 0 to 4wt% that appear linked to microstructure transitions in the BHJ active layer. While addition of FeS2 NCs consistently increases photocurrent, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) decreases in the devices with higher pyrite NC concentrations, possibly due to increased current leakage. The inverted ternary hybrid solar cells demonstrate great air-stability after aging 28 days exposed in air. Due to the inverted structure, exposure in air actually improves the VOC and FF significantly resulting in an average 28% increase in power conversion efficiency of the ternary hybrid devices compared to the control binary device with no FeS2. The photocurrent enhancement and air-stability demonstrated by this inverted design offer a promising architecture for future pyrite FeS2 NC-based devices. Furthermore, the NC characterizations presented here provide insight to advance pyrite's development as a sustainable PV material.

Abstract: Ferroportin (FPN), the sole characterized iron exporter, is mainly controlled by the peptide hormone hepcidin in response to iron, erythroid factors, hypoxia, and inflammation. In addition, intracellular iron level controls FPN translation by modulating the binding of Iron Responsive Proteins at the 5′UTR of FPN mRNA. Recently, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)2α has been shown to regulate FPN expression in intestinal cells. Here we show that, during experimentally-induced acute anemia in mice, FPN is regulated at transcriptional level in a cell-specific manner. FPN mRNA level increases in duodenum and spleen macrophages, whereas it does not change in liver and is strongly down-regulated in erythroid precursors. These results were confirmed in Caco2, Raw264.7 and K562 cells treated with a hypoxic stimulus. Moreover, we found a differential expression of HIF1α and HIF2α in cells and tissues that might account for the specificity of FPN regulation. Thus, hypoxia, by directly controlling hepcidin and its target FPN, orchestrates a complex regulatory network aimed at ensuring rapid iron recovery from the periphery and efficient iron utilization in the erythroid compartment.

Abstract: The generation in vitro of cultured red blood cells (cRBC) could become an alternative to classical transfusion products. However, even when derived from healthy donors, the cRBC generated in vitro from hematopoietic stem cells may display alterations resulting from a poor controlled production process. In this context, we attempted to monitor the quality of the transfusion products arising from new biotechnologies. For that purpose, we developed an in vitro erythrophagocytosis (EP) test with the murine fibroblast cell line MS-5 and human macrophages (reference method). We evaluated 38 batches of cRBC, at the stage of reticulocyte, generated from CD34+ cells isolated from placental blood or by leukapheresis. We showed that (i) the EP test performed with the MS-5 cell line was sensitive and can replace human macrophages for the evaluation of cultured cells. (ii) The EP tests revealed disparities among the batches of cRBC. (iii) The viability of the cells (determined by calcein-AM test), the expression of CD47 (antiphagocytosis receptor) and the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS, marker of phagocytosis) were not critical parameters for the validation of the cRBC. (iv) Conversely, the cell deformability determined by ektacytometry was inversely correlated with the intensity of the phagocytic index. Assuming that the culture conditions directly influence the quality of the cell products generated, optimization of the production mode could benefit from the erythrophagocytosis test.

Abstract: Chemotactic cell migration is triggered by extracellular concentration gradients of molecules segregated by target fields. Neural crest cells (NCCs), paradigmatic as an accurately moving cell population, undergo wide dispersion along multiple pathways, invading with precision defined sites of the embryo to differentiate into many derivatives. This report addresses the involvement of NT-3 in early colonization by cephalic NCCs invading the optic vesicle region. The results of in vitro and in vivo approaches showed that NCCs migrate directionally up an NT-3 concentration gradient. We also demonstrated the expression of NT-3 in the ocular region as well as their functional TrkB, TrkC and p75 receptors on cephalic NCCs. On whole-mount embryo, a perturbed distribution of NCCs colonizing the optic vesicle target field was shown after morpholino cancelation of cephalic NT-3 or TrkC receptor on NCCs, as well as in situ blocking of TrkC receptor of mesencephalic NCCs by specific antibody released from inserted microbeads. The present results strongly suggest that, among other complementary cell guidance factor(s), the chemotactic response of NCCs toward the ocular region NT-3 gradient is essential for spatiotemporal cell orientation, amplifying the functional scope of this neurotrophic factor as a molecular guide for the embryo cells, besides its well-known canonical functions.

Abstract: The front transparent conductive oxide layer is a source of significant optical and electrical losses in silicon heterojunction solar cells because of the trade-off between free-carrier absorption and sheet resistance. We demonstrate that hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IO:H), which has an electron mobility of over 100cm2/Vs, reduces these losses compared to traditional, low-mobility transparent conductive oxides, but suffers from high contact resistance at the interface of the IO:H layer and the silver front electrode grid. This problem is avoided by inserting a thin indium tin oxide (ITO) layer at the IO:H/silver interface. Such IO:H/ITO bilayers have low contact resistance, sheet resistance, and free-carrier absorption, and outperform IO:H-only or ITO-only layers in solar cells. We report a certified efficiency of 22.1% for a 4-cm2 screen-printed silicon heterojunction solar cell employing an IO:H/ITO bilayer as the front transparent conductive oxide.

Abstract: Two dimensional conjugated polymers have emerged as excellent polymer donor components in recent years. Here, all-polymer solar cells based on two conjugated side-chain isolated polythiophene derivatives (PT4TV and PT4TV-C) as donors and perylene diimide (PDI)-based polymer (PPDI-DTT) as acceptor are fabricated and investigated in detail. The structure similarity of the two polymers provides more insightful structure–property relationships. PT4TV based device displays a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.99%, higher than that of PT4TV-C based device (0.55%). The high fill factor of larger than 50% in PT4TV based device is ascribed to the balanced hole and electron mobility of the donor and the acceptor. By adding chloronaphthalene solvent in PT4TV: PPDI-DTT solution, the PCE of PT4TV based solar cells is enhanced to 1.17%. Such improvement is interpreted in terms of the refined morphology of the film and ideality factor of the solar cell diode.

Abstract: Iron overload is the primary cause of mortality and morbidity in thalassemia major despite advances in chelation therapy. We performed a pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined therapy with deferasirox (DFX, 20–30mg/kg daily) and deferoxamine (DFO, 35–50mg/kg on 3–7days/week) in 22 patients with persistent iron overload or organ damage. In the 18 subjects completing 12months of therapy, median liver iron concentration decreased by 31% from 17.4mg/g (range 3.9–38.2mg/g) to 12.0mg/g (range 0.96–26.7mg/g, p<0.001). Median ferritin decreased by 24% from 2465ng/mL (range 1110–10,700ng/mL) to 1875ng/mL (range 421–5800ng/mL, p=0.002). All 6 subjects with elevated myocardial iron showed improvement in MRI T2* (p=0.031). The mean±S.E. plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) declined from 3.10±0.25μM to 2.15±0.29μM (p=0.028). The administration of DFX during infusion of DFO further lowered NTBI (−0.28±0.08μM, p=0.004) and labile plasma iron (LPI, −0.03±0.01μM, p=0.006). The simultaneous administration of DFO and DFX rapidly reduced systemic and myocardial iron, and provided an excellent control of the toxic labile plasma iron species without an increase in toxicity. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00901199.

Abstract: Charge carrier extracting electrodes are shown to control the long term stability of state-of-the-art polymer solar cells. Especially low work function metals like aluminum as electron extracting contact and their interface to the photoactive material are identified to be very unstable due to oxidation and delamination, even under superior sealing conditions. In this study we deliberately employed a solution processible titanium oxide interlayer between the photoactive layer and the electron transporting metal contact to study the impact of this layer, in combination with a variation of metal back electrodes and different sealing conditions on overall device long term stability. An automated lifetime testing setup for in-situ IV-characterization and different imaging techniques, namely lock-in thermography and luminescence imaging, were used for investigation of time dependent photovoltaic behavior and laterally resolved degradation features. A titanium oxide/aluminum bilayer as electron extracting contact revealed to be very stable, exhibiting ∼100h of lifetime without any sealing and approximately 18,000h extrapolated operation time with superior glass–glass sealing, reaching commercially usable dimensions of device stability.

Abstract: A heterojunction solar cell is prepared from poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the purposely surface-modified TiO2 nanorod array. The modification is carried out by connecting polypyrrole (PPy) to the TiO2 nanorod array through an in-situ polymerization, which is initiated by photoexcited TiO2 nanorods. The as-prepared composite films are investigated by using photoluminescence emission spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. The analysis results demonstrate that modifying TiO2 nanorod array with PPy increases the efficiency of charge separation and prolongs the electron lifetime. It is observed that the modified P3HT/PPy/TiO2 solar cell shows the power conversion efficiency which is 77% higher than that of the P3HT/TiO2 solar cell. These results prove that the in-situ photopolymerization is an efficient method to modify for the heterojunction solar cell.

Abstract: New polymers based on two different angular-shaped naphthodifurans (NDFs) have been synthesized. The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the new polymers were investigated. The UV–vis absorption spectra of polymer PIDNDF1 recorded in dilute solution and as thin-film were both red-shifted compared with those of polymer PIDNDF2. The HOMO energy levels of PIDNDF1 and PIDNDF2 were similar at −5.40eV. There was slight difference in the LUMO energy levels of these two polymers. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PIDNDF1 based solar cell devices was 1.83%, which was more than twice that of PIDNDF2 based device. The difference on the device performance resulted from the shapes of NDF repeating units and backbone geometries of polymers.

Abstract: Iron-induced cardiotoxicity remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major. Heart failure in these patients, which may be reversible but has a poor prognosis, is characterized by myocardial iron deposition-related early diastolic dysfunction. Amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a sensitive biomarker for the detection of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. In this study, we prospectively evaluated plasma NT-proBNP levels in 187 adult patients aged 19–54years with β-TM. Possible correlations with the proposed recently cardiac iron concentration based on an equation derived from heart T2* assessment by MRI: [Fe]=45.0×[T2*]−1.22 with [Fe] in milligrams per gram dry weight and T2* in milliseconds were explored. We found that: 143 patients had no cardiac hemosiderosis, defined as [Fe]<1.1mg/g dry weight, corresponding to T2*>20ms and 44 patients had cardiac hemosiderosis, defined as [Fe] >1.2mg/g dry weight. The main results of the study showed that: a) NT-proBNP levels were markedly increased in thalassemic patients (152.2±190.1pg/mL, ranged from 6.0 to 1336.0pg/mL compared to normal control levels 40.1±19.7pg/mL, p<0.001, b) NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in patients with cardiac hemosiderosis compared to patients without cardiac hemosiderosis (185.1±78.0 vs 128.9±20.2pg/mL, p<0.05), c) NT-proBNP levels correlated with [Fe] values (r=0.387, p<0.001). This correlation was significant in patients with cardiac hemosiderosis (r=0.520, p<0.001), but not in patients without cardiac hemosiderosis (p>0.1), and d) no significant correlation was found between NT-proBNP levels and left ventricular ejection fraction values, (p>0.3). Our study demonstrated for first time the significant association of NT-proBNP levels and cardiac iron concentration in patients with β-thalassemia major linking blood chemistry and imaging techniques. Multicenter studies of these parameters during iron chelation therapies are needed to validate their association and further exploit its clinical use.

Abstract: α-Helical coiled-coil domains (CCDs) direct protein oligomerisation in many biological processes and are of great interest as tools in protein engineering. Although CCDs are recognizable from protein sequences, prediction of oligomer state remains challenging especially for trimeric states and above. Here we evaluate LOGICOIL, a new multi-state predictor for CCDs, with regard to families of extracellular matrix proteins. Tenascins, which are known to assemble as trimers, were the first test case. LOGICOIL out-performed other algorithms in predicting trimerisation of these proteins and sequence analyses identified features associated with many other trimerising CCDs. The thrombospondins are a larger and more ancient family that includes sub-groups that assemble as trimers or pentamers. LOGICOIL predicted the pentamerising CCDs accurately. However, prediction of TSP trimerisation was relatively poor, although accuracy was improved by analyzing only the central regions of the CCDs. Sequence clustering and phylogenetic analyses grouped the TSP CCDs into three clades comprising trimers and pentamers from vertebrates, and TSPs from invertebrates. Sequence analyses revealed distinctive, conserved features that distinguish trimerising and pentamerising CCDs. Together, these analyses provide insight into the specification of higher-order CCDs that should direct improved CCD predictions and future experimental investigations of sequence-to-structure functional relationships.

Abstract: The photovoltaic performance of inverted structure hybrid solar cells fabricated using cadmium sulfide (CdS) films and the photoactive layer of P3HT (poly(3-hexyl)thiophene) and PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester) is reported. CdS thin films with different thicknesses were deposited using the spray deposition technique. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were performed under dark and AM 1.5 illumination (mW/cm2) conditions. Inverted structure hybrid solar cells employing CdS thin films yield a short circuit current density of 1.9mA/cm2, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of ca. 0.3%.

Abstract: Erythropoiesis is controlled by a complex interplay of several signaling pathways and key transcription factors, as well as microRNAs (miRNAs). MicroRNAs function as critical modulators of gene expression for cellular processes. In the present study, we found that miR-320a inhibits erythroid differentiation by targeting Matrix Attachment Region binding protein SMAR1. miR-320a negatively regulates the expression of SMAR1 by directly binding to its 3′UTR. In response to mild DNA damage, miR-320a expression is decreased resulting in enhanced expression of SMAR1 protein, which in turn, reduces its targets, Bax and Puma inhibiting apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, enhanced expression of SMAR1 negatively correlates with miR-320a expression. Further analysis reveals that SMAR1 regulates erythroid differentiation, by binding to the promoter of miR-221/222, which play a crucial role in early erythropoiesis. Overall, our studies provide an insight into the regulation of hemin mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells through post-transcriptional regulation of SMAR1.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) on self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in the presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). We demonstrated that in the presence of LIF, the activation of PPARγ by Rosiglitazone led to an increased proliferation of mESCs whereas PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) reversed this effect. Additionally, upon PPARγ activation, LIF increased PPARγ expression and resulted in the degradation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), an important negative regulator of LIF/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-pathway. In the absence of LIF, Rosiglitazone decreased proliferation of mESCs. In this state, our results showed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) proteins were activated and resulted in the suppression of Nanog expression, an important pluripotency determinant, whereas it did not affect Oct4 expression. These results suggest that the pivotal role of PPARγ on mESC self-renewal depends on the presence and absence of LIF.

Abstract: A comprehensive study of zinc oxide (ZnO) film thickness and morphology on the electronic properties of inverted cells is reported. The complete conversion of zinc acetate precursor to 3–5nm particles of ZnO with no residual acetate is obtained after 10min at 300°C. The work-function determined by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) was 4.3eV. and is independent of the thickness of the ZnO layer or with the planarization of the ITO surface topology. However, the efficiency varies from 0.6% to 1.7% as the ZnO thickness varies from 17nm to 28nm (assuming full density for the ZnO layer) in a laminated device, with both the shunt and series resistance showing a strong variation with ZnO thickness. A relatively thick, mixed phase ZnO/bulk hetero-junction in which the bulk hetero-junction penetrates into the porous ZnO layer is proposed to explain the observed performance trends.

Abstract: The ordered ZnO cavity-like nanopatterns were fabricated through the versatile nanosphere lithography (NSL) technique combined with the hydrothermal growth. Nanostructured Cu2O/ZnO heterojunction solar cell was fabricated by the electrodeposition of Cu2O into the ordered ZnO cavity-like nanopatterns. The formation of intercrossed interface between Cu2O and ZnO could increase the p–n heterojunction area effectively compared to the planar structure. The most efficient cavity-like cell showed a highest PCE of 0.51% with a Voc of 0.24V, a Jsc of 6.33mAcm−2, and a FF of 34.5. Significant increase in Jsc and PCE observed in the cavity-like cell was due to the increased p–n heterojunction area and then the enhanced charge carriers collection ability. Our results sheded light on a simple and economic approach to fabricate electrodeposited nanostructural Cu2O/ZnO solar cells with a high efficiency.

Abstract: Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is an important pathological change of diabetic cardiomyopathy. How the elevated glucose levels cause cell apoptosis remains unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate whether activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway plays an important role in high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with 33mmol/l glucose. The expression of ALK7, Smad2 and Smad3 were inhibited by small interfering RNA respectively. The level of ALK7, total Smad2/3, phosphorylated Smad2/3, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and cleaved Caspase3 were evaluated using western blot. The apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometer. High glucose treatment caused the apoptosis of H9c2 cardiomyocyte and the inhibition of Smad2 or Smad3 attenuated this apoptosis. ALK7 existed in both H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and high ambient glucose upregulated its expression. The increased expression level of cleaved Caspase3 and apoptosis rate and decreased expression of Bcl-2 were reversed after ALK7 was inhibited. The expression of phosphorylated Smad2/3 also decreased after the knockdown of ALK7. Our findings suggest that ALK7 mediates high ambient glucose-induced H9c2 cardiomyoblasts apoptosis through the activation of Smad2/3.

Abstract: The pancreatic duodenal homeodomain transcription factor PDX-1 plays a pivotal role in the development of the pancreas and the maintenance of glucose homeostasis by pancreatic β-cells. Recently, we found that the highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed tetrameric Ser/Thr protein kinase CK2, which is formed by two catalytic subunits (α and/or α′) and two non-catalytic subunits (β), phosphorylates PDX-1. So far, only little is known about CK2 in pancreatic β-cells and how this enzyme is regulated in these cells. In the present study, we found that (i) CK2 binds to PDX-1, (ii) the binding between CK2 and PDX-1 is regulated by glucose, (iii) glucose modulates the subcellular localization of PDX-1 and CK2 and (iv) the kinase activity is also regulated by glucose. Our novel data indicate that CK2 is a co-factor of PDX-1 in response to glucose in pancreatic β-cells.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the clinical and genetic features of protein C deficiency in the Chinese population. A total of 23 symptomatic patients with protein C deficiency were identified by thrombophilic assays. Detailed clinical data about the patients with respect to their personal and family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) were collected. Mutational analysis was then performed by direct sequencing of the protein C gene (PROC) in the patients and their family members. Of the 23 patients, 30.4% (7/23) had additional risk factors, 51.2% (12/23) suffered from recurrent thrombotic episodes, and 50.0% (6/12) of the patients with recurrent thrombosis had more than one heterozygous mutation in PROC itself or combined with protein S gene (PROS). The sex distribution of male:female was 19:4 in the 23 symptomatic patients and 10:2 in the 12 recurrent patients. Almost all patients (22/23) had lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and one had pulmonary embolism (PE) only. A total of 15 different causative mutations were identified from the 23 subjects with 6 (40.0%) of the mutations being novel. Among the mutations identified, the Arg147Trp substitution was hotspot mutation in the Chinese population with a high frequency of 43.5%. Our finding suggests that complex genotypes of PROC or combined with protein S deficiency are primarily responsible for an increased risk of recurrent VTE. Our data further provides a framework for correlating the clinical pathogenesis of protein C deficiency to ethnic backgrounds in the Chinese population.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is an inherited enzyme deficiency characterised by progressive cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly and destructive bone disease. It is diagnosed by demonstration of beta glucosidase deficiency but may be suspected in presence of abnormal storage cells on tissue biopsy. Specific treatment is available in the form of enzyme replacement (ERT) and is effective in reversing many disease features. Delayed treatment has been associated with increased disease complications. This retrospective review of a single centre cohort of 86 patients was undertaken to ascertain if the diagnostic journey had improved since the introduction of ERT and commissioning of services. Fifty-six percent of patients presented primarily with features related to thrombocytopenia or splenomegaly with a median time from symptom onset to diagnosis of 2years (range 0.5–26years), 19% experiencing delays of 5 or more years. Seventy-five percent of patients were diagnosed by haematologists, 68% following an abnormal bone marrow biopsy. Raised serum ACE levels, low HDL cholesterol and raised ferritin were identified as prevalent laboratory abnormalities at the time of diagnosis. These features, coupled with the relative preservation of haemoglobin and white cell counts compared to the platelet count, help identify patients presenting to haematologists with a possible diagnosis of GD earlier in the diagnostic pathway.

Abstract: T‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a heterogeneous malignancy originating from developing lymphocyte precursors likely due to mutations in genes regulating thymocyte differentiation. Here, we characterized mutation status of BCL11B and FLT3 genes, presumably involved in T-ALL, together with FBXW7 and NOTCH1 as known players in T-ALL in 65 pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. We also aimed at the assessment of prognostic value of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations in ALL-IC BFM 2002 protocol. FLT3 and BCL11B mutations were detected in 3% and 2% of patients, respectively. FBXW7 mutations were observed in 8% of patients, while NOTCH1 was mutated in 40%. No correlation was found between NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations and traditionally used clinical factors or molecular features. In total we have detected nine mutations, which have not been previously described by others. Eight of them were found in NOTCH1 and one in BCL11B gene. Observed frequencies of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 are in line with previous reports, thus confirming postulated participation of these two genes in T-ALL pathomechanism. Moreover, we report on mutation frequency of FLT3 and BCL11B, not extensively studied in T-ALL so far. Finally, we suggest a putative role of BLC11B as an oncogene in T-ALL pathogenesis.

Abstract: The bifunctional, microbial enzyme DmpFG is comprised of two subunits: the aldolase, DmpG, and the dehydrogenase, DmpF. DmpFG is of interest due to its ability to channel substrates between the two spatially distinct active sites. While the aldolase is well studied, significantly less is known about the dehydrogenase. Steady-state kinetic measurements of the reverse reaction of DmpF confirmed that the dehydrogenase uses a ping-pong mechanism, with substrate inhibition by acetyl CoA indicating that NAD+/NADH and CoA/acetyl CoA bind to the same site in DmpF. The Km of DmpF for exogenous acetaldehyde as a substrate was 23.7mM, demonstrating the necessity for the channel to deliver acetaldehyde directly from the aldolase to the dehydrogenase active site. A channeling assay on the bifunctional enzyme gave an efficiency of 93% indicating that less than 10% of the toxic acetaldehyde leaks out of the channel into the bulk media, prior to reaching the dehydrogenase active site. The thermodynamic activation parameters of the reactions catalyzed by the aldolase, the dehydrogenase and the DmpFG complex were determined. The Gibb's free energy of activation for the dehydrogenase reaction was lower than that obtained for the full DmpFG reaction, in agreement with the high kcat obtained for the dehydrogenase reaction in isolation. Furthermore, although both the DmpF and DmpG reactions occur with small, favorable entropies of activation, the full DmpFG reaction occurs with a negative entropy of activation. This supports the concept of allosteric structural communication between the two enzymes to coordinate their activities.

Abstract: A solution-based preparation route for 7.5% efficient thin-film solar cells with a kesterite-type Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 absorber is reported that allows low carbon residues after a rapid selenization step. Metal salts are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and subsequently coated and selenized in a simple process that uses only earth abundant elements. Despite the observation of a layered structure, no clear differences are distinguishable in the chemical composition or phase formation within the absorber layer. However, there is evidence of a ZnSe-rich layer at the molybdenum back contact.

Abstract: Background
Vitamin D regulates many biological processes including bone metabolism, innate immune response, and cell proliferation and differentiation by binding to its receptor VDR. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms have been associated with many cancers like breast, colorectal, prostate, and skin. The main aim of this study was to determine whether VDR polymorphisms (ApaI, BsmI and FokI) are associated with increased risk of multiple myeloma.
Methods
We designed a case control study where 75 multiple myeloma cases were studied for VDR polymorphisms (ApaI, BsmI and FokI) against 150 controls taken from general population. The polymorphisms of VDR gene were investigated using PCR–RFLP method.
Results
We did not find any significant association between ApaI and BsmI polymorphisms and multiple myeloma risk (P>0.05), but FokI polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk for multiple myeloma. We also found a significant association between the ff variant genotype with creatinine levels, albumin levels, and Durie–Salmon stage III.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the FokI polymorphism is involved in the increased susceptibility to development and progression in multiple myeloma in the ethnic Kashmiri population. Furthermore these results suggest that ff genotype is associated with higher risk for developing multiple myeloma.

Abstract: Duffy or DARC (Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines) is a glycosylated membrane protein that selectively binds angiogenic chemokines. Previous in vivo and in vitro studies of DARC function in cancer have associated DARC over expression with better prognosis, decreased metastatic potential, and inhibition of tumor-associated neovascularization. Another carcinogenesis-associated antigen is Lutheran or BCAM (basal cell adhesion molecule), a surface glycoprotein that acts as a receptor for the extracellular matrix protein, laminin. BCAM is a protein related to tumor progression; and, its over expression is associated with skin, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. We explored DARC and BCAM functions and investigated whether or not their expressions were altered in thyroid cancer. The expression of DARC and BCAM were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in a set of 18 normal thyroid tissues (NT), 15 follicular adenomas (FTA), 17 follicular carcinomas (FTC), and 122 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), including 78 classical (CVPTC) and 44 follicular variant (FVPTC). RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed to cDNA, and used in qPCR reactions containing SYBR Green. The relative expression value was calculated using ribosomal protein S8 as an internal control. When we compared benign (NT and FTA) versus malignant samples (FTC, CVPTC and FVPTC) we observed a significant decrease of DARC and BCAM relative expression in malignant cases. Additionally, we correlated clinic-pathological features (tumor size, presence of metastasis, presence of lymphocyte infiltrate) with DARC and BCAM expression. We found a diminished expression of DARC in PTC samples, which was correlated with tumor size and presence of a lymphocyte infiltrate. We, also, found a correlation between decreased BCAM expression and tumor size or presence of metastasis. DARC and BCAM expression was associated with pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma and correlated with clinical–pathological features.

Abstract: Dual-junction solar cells formed by a GaAsP or GaInP top cell and a silicon bottom cell seem to be attractive candidates to materialize the long sought-for integration of III–V materials on silicon for photovoltaic applications. When manufacturing a multi-junction solar cell on silicon, one of the first processes to be addressed is the development of the bottom subcell and, in particular, the formation of its emitter. In this study, we analyze, both experimentally and by simulations, the formation of the emitter as a result of phosphorus diffusion that takes place during the first stages of the epitaxial growth of the solar cell. Different conditions for the Metal-Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) process have been evaluated to understand the impact of each parameter, namely, temperature, phosphine partial pressure, time exposure and memory effects in the final diffusion profiles obtained. A model based on SSupremIV process simulator has been developed and validated against experimental profiles measured by ECV and SIMS to calculate P diffusion profiles in silicon formed in a MOVPE environment taking in consideration all these factors.

Abstract: Light-induced degradation (LID) in boron-doped p-type Czochralski (Cz) silicon is caused by a boron–oxygen (BO) complex, which may be permanently deactivated by simultaneous illumination and heating leading to a permanent regeneration of carrier lifetime and solar cell performance. Up to now, regeneration has only been investigated on wafer and solar cell level. In this work, we investigate whether the regeneration gain on solar cell level can be transferred to module level. For this purpose, we fabricated solar cells with passivated emitter and rear on boron-doped p-type Cz and float zone wafers. The cells are extensively characterised regarding losses in cell performance due to LID by preparing different defect states with certain temperature and illumination treatments. The effect of the injection-dependent carrier lifetime caused by the BO complex in its active state on fill factor is investigated in detail theoretically and experimentally, developing a descriptive explanation. Finally, it is shown by integrating solar cells in the degraded and regenerated state into solar modules, that the regeneration effect can be transferred to module level and is stable upon subsequent illumination of the module.

Abstract: A thin ZnO (<200nm) film grown by Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD) in a matter of minutes was studied as a hole-blocking layer in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-buyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) based inverted solar cells. These AALD ZnO layers were compact, had a high electron mobility of 3.4+0.1cm2/Vs, had up to 100% transmittance to visible light, and a good wettability for the blend. Despite the very rapid, open atmosphere growth method, the cell performance was comparable with some of the best inverted bulk heterojunction P3HT:PCBM cells in the literature. The performance was also maintained after 200 days of storage in air in the dark.

Abstract: A new lectin from the marine sponge Haliclona caerulea (H-3) was isolated using a combination of hydrophobic interaction chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. H-3 is a protein with three distinct bands on SDS-PAGE: 9kDa, 16kDa and 18kDa. Nevertheless, on gel filtration and N-PAGE, H-3 showed a symmetrical peak and a unique band, respectively. Hemagglutinating activity of H-3 was stable at neutral pH and temperatures up to 60°C. N-Acetylgalactosamine and porcine stomach mucin were the most potent inhibitors of H-3. Primary structure of the lectin was determined using tandem mass spectrometry, and it showed no similarity to any members of the animal lectin families. Top down fragmentation revealed some posttranslational modifications in H-3, including glycosylation. The glycan composition of H-3 was determined, and its structure was predicted. Furthermore, H-3 is a blue protein, binding to a chromophore(-597) by weak interactions, and this is the first time that the interaction between one lectin and a natural chromophore has been shown.

Abstract: UGT1A1 enzyme defects are responsible of both Gilbert syndrome (GS) and Crigler–Najjar syndrome (CNS). GS depends on a variant TATAA element (which contains two extra TA nucleotides as compared to the wild type genotype) in the UGT1A1 gene promoter resulting in a reduced gene expression. On the contrary, CNS forms are classified in two types depending on serum total bilirubin concentrations (STBC): the more severe (CNS-I) is characterized by high levels of STBC (342–684μmol/L), due to total deficiency of the UGT1A1 enzyme, while the milder one, namely CNS-II, is characterized by partial UGT1A1 deficiency with STBC ranging from 103 to 342μmol/L. GS and CNS are caused by genetic lesions involving a complex locus encoding the UGT1A1 gene. The present report provides an update of all reported UGT1A1 gene mutations associated to GS and CNS.

Genistein modulates oxidative stress in breast cancer cell lines according to ERα/ERβ ratio: Effects on mitochondrial functionality, sirtuins, uncoupling protein 2 and antioxidant enzymes,

Abstract: Genistein is a biologically active isoflavone with estrogenic activity and can be found in a variety of soy products. This natural compound displays a wide array of biological activities, but it is best known for its ability to inhibit cancer progression, especially for hormone-related ones such as breast cancer. Genistein has been shown to bind both the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), although it has a higher affinity for the ERβ. The ERα/ERβ ratio is a prognostic marker for breast tumors, and ERβ expression could indicate the presence of tumors more benign in state, whereas ERα indicates malignant tumors. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of genistein on oxidative stress and mitochondrial functionality through its interaction with the estrogen receptor in breast cancer cell lines with different ERα/ERβ ratios. The lower ERα/ERβ ratio T47D cell line showed lower oxidative stress and greater mitochondrial functionality, along with an up-regulation of uncoupling protein 2 and sirtuins. On the other hand, genistein-treated MCF-7 cell line, with the highest ERα/ERβ ratio, reported no changes for the control situation. On the whole, our results show different genistein effects depending on ERα/ERβ ratio for oxidative stress regulation, mitochondrial functionality, and modulation of UCPs, antioxidant enzymes and sirtuins in breast cancer cell lines. Effects of genistein on oxidative stress and mitochondria could be due at least in part, to a higher ERβ presence, but could also be due to up-regulation of ERβ caused by the genistein treatment.

Abstract: Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation with increased adipose tissue pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) stimulates triglyceride synthesis and glucose transport via its receptor C5L2. Circulating ASP is increased in obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The present study examines the effects of normal (50nM), high physiological (200nM) and pathological (600nM) levels of ASP on inflammatory changes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and J774 macrophages and the underlying mechanisms involved. Treatment with ASP for 24h increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1, 800%, P<0.001) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC, >150%, P<0.01) secretion in adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with no effect on IL-6 or adiponectin. In macrophages, ASP had no effect on these cytokines. C5a, a ligand for C5L2 and C5aR receptors, differed from ASP. Macrophage-adipocyte coculture increased MCP-1 and adiponectin secretion, and ASP further enhanced secretion (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively) at doses of 50nM and 200nM. ASP increased Ser468 and Ser536 phosphorylation of p65 NFκB in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (P<0.05) as well as phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 (p=0.02). ASP and insulin stimulations of Ser536 p65 NFκB phosphorylation were comparable (both p<0.05) but not additive. Both inhibition of PI3kinase (with wortmannin) and NFκB (with BAY11-7085) prevented ASP stimulation of MCP-1 and KC secretion in adipocytes. These findings suggest that ASP, especially at high physiologic doses, may stimulate specific inflammatory cytokines in adipocytes through PI3kinase- and NFκB-dependant pathways, thus further promoting macrophage infiltration and local inflammation in obese adipose tissue.

Abstract: This paper reports a facile fabrication of vertical ZnO nanowalls on ITO coated glass substrates by using an aqueous solution growth method at low temperature. The formation of nanowalls is ascribed to selective dissolution of (001) planes of the chemical bath deposited dense ZnO rods. The morphology of the etched ZnO nanowalls is determined by the structure of the as-grown ZnO rod arrays, which can be readily controlled by tuning aqueous solution parameters such as: initial pH value of chemical bath solution and the growth temperature. With verticaly aligned ZnO nanowalls as electrode in inverted polymer solar cells, the average performance of devices with open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency are measured as 0.56V, 7.56mWcm−2, 0.49 and 2.14%, respectively. The results indicate that the two-dimensional structure of ZnO nanowalls can effectively serve as an electrode for inverted polymer solar cells.

Abstract: Chromatin remodeling plays an essential role in regulation of gene transcription. Consequently, targeted changes in chromatin may also augment pluripotency of somatic cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of epigenetic drug BIX-01294 (BIX), a histone G9a inhibitor, on DNA methylation, expression of pluripotency genes POU5F1 (isoform a), NANOG, KLF4, and CMYC in mesenchymal stem cells, and the ability to increase their differentiation potential into endothelial cells (ECs). Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) were isolated from abdominal adipose tissue. Cells were pre-treated with BIX for 48h and further differentiated in endothelial medium for 7 and 14 days. Global DNA methylation was determined by MethyLight application, expression of genes for pluripotency, endothelial and angiogenic markers by SYBRGreen-based real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and immunobloting. Following treatment with BIX, DNA methylation status of AdMSCs was significantly reduced by 53% (p=0.008), the expression of POU5F1 and NANOG was increased by 2.2-fold (p=0.016) and 1.5-fold (p<0.001), respectively. Furthermore, BIX pre-treatment improved the differentiation capacity of AdMSCs into ECs and significantly increased expression of several endothelial markers and factors involved in blood vessel formation: VCAM-1, PECAM-1, von Willebrand factor, VEGFR-2, PDGF, and ANG-1 in comparison with AdMSCs without BIX pre-treatment. In the present study we demonstrate that epigenetic modifying drug BIX-01294 is able to increase the ability of AdMSCs to differentiate into ECs engaging DNA and histone methylation. Hence, BIX-01294 might serve as a simple tool to increase the differentiation potential of AdMSCs.

Abstract: Repair of bone fracture requires recruitment and proliferation of stem cells with the capacity to differentiate to functional osteoblasts. Given the close association of bone and bone marrow (BM), it has been suggested that BM may serve as a source of these progenitors. To test the ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to give rise to osteo-chondrogenic cells, we used a single HSC transplantation paradigm in uninjured bone and in conjunction with a tibial fracture model. Mice were lethally irradiated and transplanted with a clonal population of cells derived from a single enhanced green fluorescent protein positive (eGFP+) HSC. Analysis of paraffin sections from these animals showed the presence of eGFP+ osteocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes. To determine the contribution of HSC-derived cells to fracture repair, non-stabilized tibial fracture was created. Paraffin sections were examined at 7days, 2weeks and 2months after fracture and eGFP+ hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteoblasts and osteocytes were identified at the callus site. These cells stained positive for Runx-2 or osteocalcin and also stained for eGFP demonstrating their origin from the HSC. Together, these findings strongly support the concept that HSCs generate bone cells and suggest therapeutic potentials of HSCs in fracture repair.

Abstract: In this article we report a morphological study of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) material system in nanoparticle organic thin films. The morphology and chemical composition of unannealed and annealed P3HT:PCBM nanoparticles has been investigated using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) for a range of P3HT molecular weights (Mw=5–72kgmol−1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to support the STXM data. We find that unannealed P3HT:PCBM nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit a common core–shell morphology, with a PCBM-rich core and P3HT-rich shell. The morphology of the thermally annealed NP films is highly dependent upon the molecular weight of the P3HT and is determined by PCBM diffusion through the P3HT matrix. Two PCBM diffusion mechanisms operate within this system: (1) at high molecular weights diffusion of molecular PCBM dominates whilst, (2) at low molecular weights diffusion of the PCBM cores is significant. The Stokes–Einstein continuum model for diffusion has been used to determine a threshold molecular weight at which the diffusion of PCBM cores is activated in these films. The calculated value (Mw~38–25kgmol−1) is shown to agree very well with experimental observations. Finally, a model for the morphological evolution of annealed P3HT:PCBM NP films is developed.

Abstract: The effects of manufacturing processes and artificial accelerated weathering on the solar reflectance and cooling effect of cool roof coatings were investigated using UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometry, laser diffraction spectrometry, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The solar reflectance and the cooling effect of the coatings were found to correlate positively with the grinding speed (over a constant grinding time) and grinding time (at a constant grinding speed) due to an improved dispersion effect of TiO2 particles. Artificial accelerated weathering slightly reduces the solar reflectance of cool roof coatings, and its influences on the cooling effect of cool roof coatings are negligible within the experimental error.

Abstract: Microcrystalline silicon oxide (µc-SiOx:H) alloys prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) represent a versatile material class for opto-electronic applications especially for thin-film and wafer based silicon solar cells. The material is a phase mixture of microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) and amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiOx:H). The possibility to enhance the optical band gap energy and to adjust the refractive index over a considerable range, together with the possibility to dope the material p-type as well as n-type, makes μc-SiOx:H an ideal material for the application as window layer, as intermediate reflector (IR), and as back reflector in thin-film silicon solar cells. Analogously, μc-SiOx:H is a suitable material for p- and n-type contact layers in silicon hetero junction (SHJ) solar cells. The present paper gives an overview on the range of physical parameters (refractive index, optical band gap, conductivity) which can be covered by this material by variation of the deposition conditions. The paper focuses on the interdependence between these material properties and optical improvements for amorphous silicon/microcrystalline silicon (a-Si:H/µc-Si:H) tandem solar cells prepared on different substrates, such as Asahi (VU) and sputtered ZnO:Al. It gives a guideline on possible optical gains when using doped µc-SiOx:H in silicon based solar cells. As intermediate reflector in a-Si:H/µc-Si:H tandem cells µc-SiOx:H leads to an effective transfer of short circuit current generation from the bottom cell to the top cell resulting in a possible thickness reduction of the top cell by 40%. Within another series of solar cells shown in this paper a short circuit current density of 14.1mA/cm² for an a-Si:H/µc-Si:H tandem solar cell with a µc-SiOx:H intermediate reflector is demonstrated. A SHJ solar cell on a flat (non-textured) wafer using p- and n-type doped µc-SiOx:H contact layers with an effective area efficiency of 19.0% is also presented.

Abstract: We present an innovative dry etching method to modify the surface of in-house ZnO:B (BZO) films deposited by the LP-MOCVD technique. With the optimized hydrogen and methane mixed gas plasma post treatment process, we obtain a novel surface texture that constitutes of pyramids with enlarged feature size (>1μm) and shrunken feature size (<0.2μm), which can improve the light trapping capability both in short and long wavelength region. In addition, we also discuss the evolution of optical and electrical properties of BZO films with etching time. When those etched BZO films are used as front contacts in a-Si:H solar cells, the recovery of open circuit voltage and fill factor can be ascribed to the soft sharp edges of the new pyramids texture. The conversion efficiency of single a-Si:H solar cells can reach up to 6.2% for an absorber layer thickness only around 140nm.

Abstract: The main objective of the present study was to investigate if vanadate is extruded from the cells in a glutathione dependent manner resulting in the appearance of extracellular glutathione and complexes of glutathione with vanadium. Vanadate significantly depleted intracellular non-protein sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The intracellular NPSH level was decreased to 0.0±0.0μmol/ml erythrocyte when exposed to 10mM of vanadate for 4h. Extracellular NPSH level was increased concomitantly with the intracellular decrease and reached to 0.1410±0.005μmol/ml erythrocyte in 4h. Intracellular decrease and extracellular increase in NPSH levels were significantly inhibited in the presence of DIDS, a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger which also mediates phosphate and arsenate transport in erythrocytes. In parallel with the increase in extracellular NPSH levels, significant increases in extracellular glutathione levels were detected following exposure to vanadate. Extracellular glutathione levels reached to 0.0150±0.0.001, 0.0330±0.001, and 0.0576±0.002μmol/ml erythrocyte with 1, 5, and 10mM of vanadate respectively. Dimercaptosuccinic acid treatment of supernatants significantly increased the glutathione levels measured in the extracellular media. Utilization of MK571 an MRP inhibitor decreased the rate of glutathione efflux from erythrocytes suggesting a role for this membrane transporter in the process. A known methylation inhibitor periodate oxidized adenosine decreased the rate of glutathione efflux from erythrocytes. This observed decrease in extracellular GSH levels suggests that GSH release partly requires a proper cellular methylation process and that part of GSH detected in the extracellular media may arise from GSH–vandium complexes. The results of the present study indicate that human erythrocyte efflux glutathione in reduced free form and in conjugated form/s that can be recovered with dimercaptosuccinic acid when exposed to vanadate.

Abstract: Forward genetic screens have been performed in many species to identify phenotypes in specific organ systems. We have undertaken a large-scale N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen to identify dominant mutations that perturb erythropoiesis in mice. Mutant mice that displayed an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) greater than three standard deviations from the population mean were identified. Two of these lines, RBC13 and RBC14, displayed a hypochromic, microcytic anemia, accompanied by a marked reticulocytosis, splenomegaly and diminished red cell survival. Timed pregnancies from heterozygous intercrosses revealed that a quarter of the embryos displayed severe anemia and did not survive beyond embryonic day (E) 18.5, consistent with homozygous β-thalassemia. Genetic complementation studies with a β-thalassemia mouse line reproduced the embryonic lethality in compound heterozygotes and a genomic custom capture array and massively parallel sequencing of the β-globin locus identified the causative mutations. The RBC13 line displayed a nonsense mutation at codon 40 in exon 2 of the β-major gene, invoking parallels with the common β039 thalassemia mutation seen in humans. The RBC14 line exhibited a mutation at the polyadenylation signal of the β-major gene, exactly replicating a human β-thalassemia mutation. The RBC13 and RBC14 lines are the first β-thalassemia mouse models that reproduce human β-thalassemia at the genomic level, and as such highlight the power of ENU mutagenesis screens in generating mouse models of human disease.

Abstract: Iron overload may still occur in transfusion-independent patients with β-thalassemia intermedia due to increased intestinal iron absorption. In this study, we evaluated the association between iron overload, using a liver iron concentration threshold of therapeutic significance (≥5mg/g), and morbidity in 168 chelation naive patients with β-thalassemia intermedia. We demonstrated that patients with a liver iron concentration ≥5mg/g have a significantly higher prevalence of several serious vascular and endocrine/bone morbidities than do patients with <5mg/g, and we established absolute morbidity risk values differentiating both groups. We also demonstrated that the association between iron overload and morbidity in such patients is independent of the effects of advancing age and disease severity. These findings suggest that treating iron burden in β-thalassemia intermedia may be associated with reduction in serious morbidity risk.

Abstract: Background
Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by the reduced activity of lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages and a chronic stimulation of the immune system. GD is divided into 3 main types according to the presence or absence of neurological involvement and to its presentation (acute or chronic). Gaucher cells show an increase in their expression of HLA-DR antigens on their surface, and there is an increase in levels of antigen-presenting molecules. Over 100 diseases have already been associated to HLA antigens; however, this association has never been studied in GD.
Objectives
To analyze the variability of HLA genes in a Southern Brazilian sample of GD patients, to compare it with controls, and to look for associations with clinical manifestations.
Methodology
Thirty-one GD patients (24 mild, 4 moderate, and 3 severe) were included in the study. They were typed for HLA A, B, and DR and compared to 250 healthy controls. The clinical data were obtained from the review of medical records.
Results/discussion
There was a significant difference in the frequency of B37 allele among patients when compared to controls (p=0.011, OR 13.28). An association was found between DR11 (p=0.008) and DR13 (p=0.011) alleles and the severity of the disease. DR11 allele seems to be associated to neurologic compromise, while DR13 seems to be associated to osteonecrosis.
Conclusion
Our data suggest a possible association of HLA variants and GD. The HLA variants must be further studied, for they seem to be a phenotype-modifier factor for GD.

Abstract: Multiple protective effects of pharmacological activated protein C (APC) are reported in several organ pathologies. To help evaluate the endogenous murine PC system, we characterized a rat monoclonal anti-mouse PC antibody, SPC-54, which inhibited the amidolytic and anticoagulant activities of murine APC by>95%. SPC-54 blocked active site titration of purified APC using the active site titrant, biotinylated FPR-chloromethylketone, showing that SPC-54 blocks access to APC's active site to inhibit all enzymatic activity. A single injection of SPC-54 (10mg/kg) neutralized circulating PC in mice for at least 7days, and immunoblotting and immuno-precipitation with protein G-agarose confirmed that SPC-54 in vivo was bound to PC in plasma. Pre-infusion of SPC-54 in tissue factor-induced murine acute thromboembolism experiments caused a major decrease in mean survival time compared to controls (7min vs. 42.5min, P=0.0016). SPC-54 decreased lung perfusion in this model by 54% when monitored by vascular perfusion methodologies using infrared fluorescence of Evans blue dye. In LD50 endotoxemia murine models, SPC-54 infused at 7hr after endotoxin administration increased mortality from 42% to 100% (P<0.001). In summary, monoclonal antibody SPC-54 ablates in vitro and in vivo APC protective functions and enzymatic activity. The ability of SPC-54 to block the endogenous PC/APC system provides a powerful tool to understand better the role of the endogenous PC system in murine injury models and in cell bioassays and also to neutralize the enzymatic activities of murine APC in any assay system.
