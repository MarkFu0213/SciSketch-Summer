Abstract: Summary
Self-renewal potential and multipotency are hallmarks of a stem cell. It is generally accepted that acquisition of such stemness requires rejuvenation of somatic cells through reprogramming of their genetic and epigenetic status. We show here that a simple block of cell differentiation is sufficient to induce and maintain stem cells. By overexpression of the transcriptional inhibitor ID3 in murine hematopoietic progenitor cells and cultivation under B cell induction conditions, the cells undergo developmental arrest and enter a self-renewal cycle. These cells can be maintained in vitro almost indefinitely, and the long-term cultured cells exhibit robust multi-lineage reconstitution when transferred into irradiated mice. These cells can be cloned and re-expanded with 50% plating efficiency, indicating that virtually all cells are self-renewing. Equivalent progenitors were produced from human cord blood stem cells, and these will ultimately be useful as a source of cells for immune cell therapy.

Abstract: Numerous compounds for treating human disease have been discovered in nature. Manumycin-A (Man-A) is a natural, well-tolerated microbial metabolite and a potent experimental tumoricide. We recently showed that Man-A stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) which were upstream of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) dephosphorylation and caspase-dependent cleavage of MEK and Akt in lymphoma apoptosis. Conversely, activation-specific, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of MEK and Akt proteins was stable in Man-A-resistant tumors suggesting that stimulation of Ser/Thr PPase activity might be required for Man-A tumoricidal activity. Pre-treatment with Calyculin-A, an equipotent inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, blocked all downstream effects of Man-A whereas, the PP2A-selective inhibitor, Okadaic acid did not, suggesting that PP1 and not PP2A played a role in Man-A action. Phosphorylation of PP1α on Thr320 inhibits its activity. Hence, we posited that if PP1α was important for Man-A action, then Man-A treatment should promote dephosphorylation of PP1α on Thr320. Indeed, T320 was only dephosphorylated in the tumors that underwent apoptosis. Lastly, stable over-expression of a constitutively active PP1α mimetic (PP1αT320A mutant), elevated basal ROS levels and enhanced Man-A-stimulated apoptosis. Taken together, we conclude that PP1α is an important proximal effector of Man-A mediated lymphoma apoptosis and that the mechanisms of Man-A action warrant further investigation.

Abstract: PHOX2B is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of neurogenesis and in the correct differentiation of the autonomic nervous system. The pathogenetic role of PHOX2B in neuroblastoma (NB) is supported by mutations in familial, sporadic and syndromic cases of NB and overexpression of PHOX2B and its target ALK in tumor samples and NB cell lines. Starting from these observations, we have performed in vitro drug screening approaches targeting PHOX2B overexpression as a potential pharmacological means in NB. In particular, in order to identify molecules able to decrease PHOX2B expression, we have evaluated the effects of 70 compounds in IMR-32 cell line stably expressing the luciferase gene under the control of the PHOX2B promoter. Curcumin, SAHA and trichostatin A showed to down-regulate the PHOX2B promoter activity which resulted in a decrease of both protein and mRNA expressions. In addition, we have observed that curcumin acts by interfering with PBX-1/MEIS-1, NF-κB and AP-1 complexes, in this work demonstrated for the first time to regulate the transcription of the PHOX2B gene. Finally, combined drug treatments showed successful effects in down-regulating the expression of both PHOX2B and its target ALK genes, thus supporting the notion of the effectiveness of molecule combination in tumor therapy.

Abstract: Paramecium is a single cell able to divide in its morphologically differentiated stage that has many cilia anchored at its cell surface. Many thousands of cilia are thus assembled in a short period of time during division to duplicate the cell pattern while the cell continues swimming. Most, but not all, of these sensory cilia are motile and involved in two main functions: prey capture and cell locomotion. These cilia display heterogeneity, both in their length and their biochemical properties. Thanks to these properties, as well as to the availability of many postgenomic tools and the possibility to follow the regrowth of cilia after deciliation, Paramecium offers a nice opportunity to study the assembly of the cilia, as well as the genesis of their diversity within a single cell. In this paper, after a brief survey of Paramecium morphology and cilia properties, we describe the tools and the protocols currently used for immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry to analyze cilia, with special recommendations to overcome the problem raised by cilium diversity.

Abstract: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP/ACP5/uteroferrin/purple acid phosphatase/PP5) has received considerable attention as a newly discovered proinvasion metastasis driver associated with different malignancies. This renders TRAP an interesting target for novel anti-cancer therapy approaches. TRAP exists as two isoforms, 5a and 5b, where the 5a isoform represents an enzymatically less active monomeric precursor to the more enzymatically active 5b isoform generated by proteolytic excision of a repressive loop domain. Recently, three novel lead compounds were identified by fragment-based screening and demonstrated to be efficient TRAP enzyme inhibitors in vitro. We conclude that one of the three compounds i.e. 5-phenylnicotinic acid (CD13) was efficient as a TRAP inhibitor with Kic values in the low micromolar range towards the TRAP 5b isoform, but was not able to inhibit the TRAP 5a isoform. Structure-based docking revealed similar interactions of CD13 with the active site in both TRAP isoforms. In stably TRAP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, CD13 inhibited intracellular TRAP activity and showed no cytotoxicity at 200µM. Furthermore, CD13 selectively blocked the TRAP 5b isoform compared to the TRAP 5a in cultured cells, indicating the usefulness of CD13 for assessing the different biological functions of the two TRAP isoforms 5a and 5b in cell systems. Moreover, inhibition of cell migration and invasion of stably TRAP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 by CD13 was observed. These data establish a proof of principle that a small chemical inhibitor of the TRAP enzyme can block TRAP-dependent functions in cancer cells.

Abstract: Due to their cardiac origin, H9c2 cells rank among the most popular cell lines in current cardiovascular research, yet molecular phenotype remains elusive. Hence, in this study we used proteomic approach to describe molecular phenotype of H9c2 cells in their undifferentiated (i.e., most frequently used) state, and its functional response to cardiotoxic drug doxorubicin. Of 1671 proteins identified by iTRAQ IEF/LC–MSMS analysis, only 12 proteins were characteristic for striated muscle cells and none was cardiac phenotype-specific. Targeted LC-SRM and western blot analyses confirmed that undifferentiated H9c2 cells are phenotypically considerably different to both primary neonatal cardiomyocytes and adult myocardium. These cells lack proteins essential for formation of striated muscle myofibrils or they express only minor amounts thereof. They also fail to express many proteins important for metabolism of muscle cells. The challenge with clinically relevant concentrations of doxorubicin did not induce a proteomic signature that has been previously noted in primary cardiomyocytes or adult hearts. Instead, several alterations previously described in other cells of mesodermal origin, such as fibroblasts, were observed (e.g., severe down-regulation of collagen synthesis pathway). In conclusion, the molecular phenotype of H9c2 cells resembles very immature myogenic cells with skeletal muscle commitment upon differentiation and thus, translatability of findings obtained in these cells deserves caution.

Abstract: Stem cell-based neuronal differentiation has provided a unique opportunity for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. Neurospheres are the most commonly used neuroprogenitors for neuronal differentiation, but they often clump in culture, which has always represented a challenge for neurodifferentiation. In this study, we report a novel method and defined culture conditions for generating sub-type or region-specific neurons from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells derived neurosphere without any genetic manipulation. Round and bright-edged neurospheres were generated in a supplemented knockout serum replacement medium (SKSRM) with 10% CO2, which doubled the expression of the NESTIN, PAX6 and FOXG1 genes compared with those cultured with 5% CO2. Furthermore, an additional step (AdSTEP) was introduced to fragment the neurospheres and facilitate the formation of a neuroepithelial-type monolayer that we termed the “neurosphederm”. The large neural tube-type rosette (NTTR) structure formed from the neurosphederm, and the NTTR expressed higher levels of the PAX6, SOX2 and NESTIN genes compared with the neuroectoderm-derived neuroprogenitors. Different layers of cortical, pyramidal, GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic neurons appeared within 27days using the neurosphederm, which is a shorter period than in traditional neurodifferentiation-protocols (42–60days). With additional supplements and timeline dopaminergic and Purkinje neurons were also generated in culture too. Furthermore, our in vivo results indicated that the fragmented neurospheres facilitated significantly better neurogenesis in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse brains compared with the non-fragmented neurospheres. Therefore, this neurosphere-based neurodifferentiation protocol is a valuable tool for studies of neurodifferentiation, neuronal transplantation and high throughput screening assays.

Abstract: Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in tissue repair and regeneration. New sources of stem cells in adult organisms are continuously emerging; dental tissues have been identified as a source of postnatal MSCs. Dental bud is the immature precursor of the tooth, is easy to access and we show in this study that it can yield a high number of cells with ≥95% expression of mesenchymal stemness makers and osteogenic capacity. Thus, these cells can be defined as Dental Bud Stem Cells (DBSCs) representing a promising source for bone regeneration of stomatognathic as well as other systems. Cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and neighboring cells are critical for tissue morphogenesis and architecture; such interactions are mediated by integrins and cadherins respectively. We characterized DBSCs for the expression of these adhesion receptors and examined their pattern during osteogenic differentiation. Our data indicate that N-cadherin and cadherin-11 were expressed in undifferentiated DBSCs and their expression underwent changes during the osteogenic process (decreasing and increasing respectively), while expression of E-cadherin and P-cadherin was very low in DBSCs and did not change during the differentiation steps. Such expression pattern reflected the mesenchymal origin of DBSCs and confirmed their osteoblast-like features. On the other hand, osteogenic stimulation induced the upregulation of single subunits, αV, β3, α5, and the formation of integrin receptors α5β1 and αVβ3. DBSCs differentiation toward osteoblastic lineage was enhanced when cells were grown on fibronectin (FN), vitronectin (VTN), and osteopontin (OPN), ECM glycoproteins which contain an integrin-binding sequence, the RGD motif. In addition we established that integrin αVβ3 plays a crucial role during the commitment of MSCs to osteoblast lineage, whereas integrin α5β1 seems to be dispensable. These data suggest that functionalization of biomaterials with such ECM proteins would improve bone reconstruction therapies starting from dental stem cells.

Abstract: After CNS injury, astrocytes and mesenchymal cells attempt to restore the disrupted glia limitans by secreting proteoglycans and extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs), forming the so-called glial scar. Although the glial scar is important in sealing the lesion, it is also a physical and functional barrier that prevents axonal regeneration. The synthesis of secretory proteins in the RER is under the control of the initiation factor of translation eIF2α. Inhibiting the synthesis of secretory proteins by increasing the phosphorylation of eIF2α, might be a pharmacologically efficient way of reducing proteoglycans and other profibrotic proteins present in the glial scar. Salubrinal, a neuroprotective drug, decreased the expression and secretion of proteoglycans and other profibrotic proteins induced by EGF or TGFβ, maintaining eIF2α phosphorylated. Besides, Salubrinal also reduced the transcription of proteoglycans and other profibrotic proteins, suggesting that it induced the degradation of non-translated mRNA. In a model in vitro of the glial scar, cortical neurons grown on cocultures of astrocytes and fibroblasts with TGFβ treated with Salubrinal, showed increased neurite outgrowth compared to untreated cells. Our results suggest that Salubrinal may be considered of therapeutic value facilitating axonal regeneration, by reducing overproduction and secretion of proteoglycans and profibrotic protein inhibitors of axonal growth.

Abstract: In the past few years, the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has emerged as a powerful model system to study the assembly and function of cilia. S. mediterranea is a free-living flatworm that uses the beating of cilia on its ventral epidermis for locomotion. The ventral epidermis is composed of a single layer of multiciliated cells highly similar to the multiciliated cells that line the airway, the brain ventricles, and the oviducts in humans. The genome of S. mediterranea has been sequenced and efficient methods for targeting gene expression by RNA interference (RNAi) are available. Locomotion defects induced by perturbing the expression of ciliary genes can be often detected by simple visual screening, and more subtle defects can be detected by measuring locomotion speed. Cilia are present in large numbers and are directly accessible, which facilitates analyses by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Here we describe a set of methods for maintaining planarians in the lab. These include gene knockout by RNAi, cilia visualization by immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and live imaging.

Abstract: Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR), a member of nuclear receptor superfamily, acts as a ‘xenosensor’ in our body and modulates a network of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and elimination. Expression levels of PXR in certain metabolic disorders including cancer are reported to be altered and its induced expression is associated with the development of resistance towards chemotherapy and adverse drug–drug interactions. Though the transcriptional regulation of PXR target genes have been elucidated in significant details, the structure and functional control of PXR promoter itself remains inadequately explored. In this work, we identify a Composite Element (CE) located within the proximal PXR promoter region that consists of multiple overlapping cis-elements and demonstrated that CE interacts specifically with some critical nuclear proteins. Subsequent DNA-protein interaction studies revealed mutually exclusive interactions on CE occurring between Sp1 and two unidentified DNA binding proteins with molecular masses of 50 and 54kDa. Here, we report the identification of 54kDa CE binding protein as a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) and demonstrate the effect of hnRNP K and Sp1 on PXR promoter transcriptional activity. Overall, the study indicates that PXR gene is tightly regulated to maintain a low receptor level.

Abstract: The cancer cells residing in the hypoxic layer are resistant to radiation and these are ones responsible for cancer recurrence after radiation therapy. One of the reasons why hypoxic cancer cells acquire radioresistance may be attributable to changes in the gene expression profile by the activation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). However, the details underlying this process remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of knockdown of HIF subunit genes to elucidate how HIF subunit genes may be involved in the radioresistance acquired by HeLa cells following exposure to a hypoxia mimic. Interestingly, HIF-1α and HIF-2α seemed mutually complementary for each other when either of them was suppressed. We thus suppressed the expression of both genes simultaneously. To do this, we developed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting a high homology region between HIF-1α and HIF-2α. It was shown that the expression of the shRNA effectively suppressed the acquisition of radioresistance following the hypoxia mimic. Moreover, it was confirmed that suppression of both subunits resulted in the downregulation of stem cell markers and the suppression of spheroid formation during the hypoxia mimicking-conditions. This shRNA-mediated knockdown method targeting a common region shared by a family of genes may offer a new candidate cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Precise self-renewal of the germ cell lineage is fundamental to fertility and reproductive success. The early precursors for the germ lineage, primordial germ cells (PGCs), survive and proliferate in several embryonic locations during their migration to the embryonic gonad. By elucidating the active signaling pathways in migratory PGCs in vivo, we were able to create culture conditions that recapitulate this embryonic germ cell environment. In defined medium conditions without feeder cells, the growth factors FGF2, insulin, and Activin A, signaling through their cognate-signaling pathways, were sufficient for self-renewal of germline-competent PGCs. Forced expression of constitutively active MEK1, AKT, and SMAD3 proteins could replace their respective upstream growth factors. Unexpectedly, we found that BMP4 could replace Activin A in non-clonal growth conditions. These defined medium conditions identify the key molecular pathways required for PGC self-renewal and will facilitate efforts in biobanking of chicken genetic resources and genome editing.

Abstract: Understanding the structure and function of the centrosome will require identification of its constituent components and a detailed characterization of the interactions among these components. Here, we describe the application of proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) to identify spatial and temporal relationships among centrosome proteins. The BioID method relies on protein fusions to a promiscuous mutant of the Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA, which biotinylates proteins that are in a ∼10 nm labeling radius of the enzyme. The biotinylated proteins are captured by affinity and are identified by mass spectrometry. Proteins identified in this way are referred to as “proximity interactors.” Application of BioID to a set of centrosome proteins demonstrated the utility of this approach in overcoming inherent limitations in probing centrosome structure. These studies also demonstrated the potential of BioID for building large-scale proximity interaction maps among centrosome proteins. In this chapter, we describe the work flow for identification of proximity interactions of centrosome proteins, including materials and methods for the generation and characterization of a BirA*-fusion protein expression plasmid, expression of BirA*-fusion proteins in cells, and purification and identification of proximity partners by mass spectrometry.

Abstract: Summary
Necroptosis is a form of programmed necrosis that is mediated by signaling complexes containing the receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) and RIP1 kinases. We show that RIP3 and its interaction with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protein ICP6 triggers necroptosis in infected mouse cells and limits viral propagation in mice. ICP6 interacts with RIP1/RIP3 through its RHIM domain and forms dimers/oliogmers by its C-terminal R1 domain. These binding events result in RIP1-RIP3 hetero- and RIP3-RIP3 homo-interactions and subsequent necroptosis of HSV-1-infected mouse cells. However, ICP6 RHIM cannot trigger necroptosis and even inhibits TNF-induced necroptosis in human cells. As the RHIM domain in murine cytomegalovirus protein vIRA can inhibit necroptosis in both human and mouse cells, these data suggest that both viral and host RHIM sequences determine whether the virus-host RHIM interaction is pro- or anti-necroptotic and that some viruses may evolve to escape this restriction.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) inhabit distinct microenvironments within the adult bone marrow (BM), which govern the delicate balance between HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation. Previous reports have proposed that HSCs localize to the vascular niche, comprised of endothelium and tightly associated perivascular cells. Herein, we examine the capacity of BM endothelial cells (BMECs) to support ex vivo and in vivo hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that AKT1-activated BMECs (BMEC-Akt1) have a unique transcription factor/cytokine profile that supports functional HSCs in lieu of complex serum and cytokine supplementation. Additionally, transplantation of BMEC-Akt1 cells enhanced regenerative hematopoiesis following myeloablative irradiation. These data demonstrate that BMEC-Akt1 cultures can be used as a platform for the discovery of pro-HSC factors and justify the utility of BMECs as a cellular therapy. This technical advance may lead to the development of therapies designed to decrease pancytopenias associated with myeloablative regimens used to treat a wide array of disease states.

Abstract: Summary
As the quintessential reprogramming model, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC re-wire somatic cells to achieve induced pluripotency. Yet, subtle differences in methodology confound comparative studies of reprogramming mechanisms. Employing transposons, we systematically assessed cellular and molecular hallmarks of mouse somatic cell reprogramming by various polycistronic cassettes. Reprogramming responses varied in the extent of initiation and stabilization of transgene-independent pluripotency. Notably, the cassettes employed one of two KLF4 variants, differing only by nine N-terminal amino acids, which generated dissimilar protein stoichiometry. Extending the shorter variant by nine N-terminal amino acids or augmenting stoichiometry by KLF4 supplementation rescued both protein levels and phenotypic disparities, implicating a threshold in determining reprogramming outcomes. Strikingly, global gene expression patterns elicited by published polycistronic cassettes diverged according to each KLF4 variant. Our data expose a Klf4 reference cDNA variation that alters polycistronic factor stoichiometry, predicts reprogramming hallmarks, and guides comparison of compatible public data sets.

Abstract: Summary
Enteric pathogens must overcome intestinal defenses to establish infection. In Drosophila, the ERK signaling pathway inhibits enteric virus infection. The intestinal microflora also impacts immunity but its role in enteric viral infection is unknown. Here we show that two signals are required to activate antiviral ERK signaling in the intestinal epithelium. One signal depends on recognition of peptidoglycan from the microbiota, particularly from the commensal Acetobacter pomorum, which primes the NF-kB-dependent induction of a secreted factor, Pvf2. However, the microbiota is not sufficient to induce this pathway; a second virus-initiated signaling event involving release of transcriptional paused genes mediated by the kinase Cdk9 is also required for Pvf2 production. Pvf2 stimulates antiviral immunity by binding to the receptor tyrosine kinase PVR, which is necessary and sufficient for intestinal ERK responses. These findings demonstrate that sensing of specific commensals primes inflammatory signaling required for epithelial responses that restrict enteric viral infections.

Abstract: Successful reconstitutions of SNARE-mediated intracellular membrane fusion have been achieved in bulk fusion assays since 1998 and in single liposome fusion assays since 2004. Especially in neuronal presynaptic SNARE-mediated exocytosis, fusion is controlled by numerous accessory proteins, of which some functions have also been reconstituted in vitro. The development of and results obtained with two fundamentally different single liposome fusion assays, namely liposome-to-supported membrane and liposome-to-liposome, are reviewed. Both assays distinguish between liposome docking and fusion steps of the overall fusion reaction and both assays are capable of resolving hemi-and full-fusion intermediates and end states. They have opened new windows for elucidating the mechanisms of these fundamentally important cellular reactions with unprecedented time and molecular resolution. Although many of the molecular actors in this process have been discovered, we have only scratched the surface of looking at their fascinating plays, interactions, and choreographies that lead to vesicle traffic as well as neurotransmitter and hormone release in the cell.

Abstract: Summary
The application of stem-cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine is hindered by the tumorigenic potential of residual human pluripotent stem cells. Previously, we identified a human pluripotent stem-cell-specific lectin probe, called rBC2LCN, by comprehensive glycome analysis using high-density lectin microarrays. Here we developed a recombinant lectin-toxin fusion protein of rBC2LCN with a catalytic domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, termed rBC2LCN-PE23, which could be expressed as a soluble form from the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography. rBC2LCN-PE23 bound to human pluripotent stem cells, followed by its internalization, allowing intracellular delivery of a cargo of cytotoxic protein. The addition of rBC2LCN-PE23 to the culture medium was sufficient to completely eliminate human pluripotent stem cells. Thus, rBC2LCN-PE23 has the potential to contribute to the safety of stem-cell-based therapies.

Abstract: It is generally accepted that Friedreich׳s ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a deficiency in frataxin expression, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis, which mainly affects the brain, dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, heart and in certain cases the pancreas. However, there is little knowledge as to other possible genes that may be affected in this disorder, and which can contribute to its complexity. In the current study we compared human periodontal ligament cells gene expression of healthy individuals and FRDA patients. The expression of active-caspase 3, as well as other apoptosis-related genes, was increased in the FRDA cells. Furthermore, iron–sulphur cluster genes, as well as oxidative stress-related genes were overexpressed in FRDA. Moreover, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neuregulin 1 and miR-132 were all upregulated. These three genes are capable of regulating the expression of each other. Interestingly, when the cells from FRDA patients were co-cultured in the presence of idebenone and deferiprone, caspase expression decreased while antioxidant gene expression, as well as frataxin expression, increased. Regarding epigenetic mechanisms, the frataxin gene was hypermethylated, compared to the healthy counterparts, in the upstream GAA repetitive region. Of the three DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 but not DNMT3׳s gene expression was higher in FRDA cells. In conclusion, our data show that FRDA cells present altered expression of genes related to cell cycle, oxidative stress and iron homeostasis which may be implicated in the increased apoptotic levels. Also, the altered expression is in a certain degree normalized in the presence of idebenone and deferiprone.

Abstract: Epithelial cells polarize their plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains where the apical membrane faces the luminal side of an organ and the basolateral membrane is in contact with neighboring cells and the basement membrane. To maintain this polarity, newly synthesized and internalized cargos must be sorted to their correct target domain. Over the last ten years, recycling endosomes have emerged as an important sorting station at which proteins destined for the apical membrane are segregated from those destined for the basolateral membrane. Essential for basolateral sorting from recycling endosomes is the tissue-specific adaptor complex AP-1B. This chapter describes experimental protocols to analyze the AP-1B function in epithelial cells including the analysis of protein sorting in LLC-PK1 cells lines, immunoprecipitation of cargo proteins after chemical crosslinking to AP-1B, and radioactive pulse-chase experiments in MDCK cells depleted of the AP-1B subunit μ1B.

Abstract: Glial scar formation derived from astrocyte proliferation and migration influences the functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, whose activity is closely related to its phosphorylation state, reportedly regulates astrocyte proliferation and migration. In this study, we reported that p27Kip1 undergoes O-GlcNAc modification at Ser 2, Ser 110 and Thr 197. Inhibiting O-GlcNAcylation on Ser 2 by gene mutation (S2A) attenuated the phosphorylation of Ser 10, and vice versa. Interestingly, compared with wild type p27Kip1, S2A p27Kip1 displayed a decreased interaction with CRM1 and reduced nuclear export following serum starvation and release. In addition, the interaction between stathmin and S2A p27Kip1 was also decreased. Cytoskeletal proteins microtubules appeared high density in astrocytes transfected with S2A p27Kip1 especially at the leading edge of the scratch wound. Accordingly, scratch-wound assay revealed that the motility of astrocytes transfected with S2A p27Kip1 was faster than that of control. Finally, we injected lentiviral vectors immediately after spinal cord contusion, and found the lesion volume of the rat injected with S2A p27Kip1 was smaller than that of rat injected with wild type p27Kip1. Besides, the BBB and CBS behavioral tests showed greater functional recovery in S2A p27Kip1 treated rats. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel function of O-GlcNAc modification of p27Kip1 in mediating astrocytes migration and functional recovery after spinal cord contusion.

Role of lipid rafts in neuronal differentiation of dental pulp-derived stem cells,

Abstract: Human dental pulp-derived stem cells (hDPSCs) are characterized by a typical fibroblast-like morphology. They express specific markers for mesenchymal stem cells and are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, adipoblasts and neurons in vitro. Previous studies showed that gangliosides are involved in the induction of early neuronal differentiation of hDPSCs. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of lipid rafts in this process. Lipid rafts are signaling microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, tyrosine kinase receptors, mono- or heterotrimeric G proteins and GPI-anchored proteins. We preliminary showed that established cells expressed multipotent mesenchymal stromal-specific surface antigens. Then, we analyzed the distribution of lipid rafts, revealing plasma membrane microdomains with GM2 and EGF-R enrichment. Following stimulation with EGF/bFGF, neuronal differentiation was observed. To analyze the functional role of lipid rafts in EGF/bFGF-induced hDPSCs differentiation, cells were preincubated with lipid raft affecting agents, i.e. [D]-PDMP or methyl-β-cyclodextrin. These compounds significantly prevented neuronal-specific antigen expression, as well as Akt and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, induced by EGF/bFGF, indicating that lipid raft integrity is essential for EGF/bFGF-induced hDPSCs differentiation. These results suggest that lipid rafts may represent specific chambers, where multimolecular signaling complexes, including lipids (gangliosides, cholesterol) and proteins (EGF-R), play a role in hDPSCs differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) by overexpression of cardiac transcription factors, including Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5; however, this process is inefficient under serum-based culture conditions, in which conversion of partially reprogrammed cells into fully reprogrammed functional iCMs has been a major hurdle. Here, we report that a combination of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2, FGF10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), termed FFV, promoted cardiac reprogramming under defined serum-free conditions, increasing spontaneously beating iCMs by 100-fold compared with those under conventional serum-based conditions. Mechanistically, FFV activated multiple cardiac transcriptional regulators and converted partially reprogrammed cells into functional iCMs through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways. Moreover, FFV enabled cardiac reprogramming with only Mef2c and Tbx5 through the induction of cardiac reprogramming factors, including Gata4. Thus, defined culture conditions promoted the quality of cardiac reprogramming, and this finding provides new insight into the mechanism of cardiac reprogramming.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is both the major source of intracellular Ca2+ for cell signaling and the organelle that forms the most extensive contacts with the plasma membrane and other organelles. Lysosomes fulfill important roles in degrading cellular materials and in cholesterol handling, but they also contribute to Ca2+ signaling by both releasing and sequestering Ca2+. Interactions between ER and other Ca2+-transporting membranes, notably mitochondria and the plasma membrane, often occur at sites where the two membranes are closely apposed, allowing local Ca2+ signaling between them. These interactions are often facilitated by scaffold proteins. Recent evidence suggests similar local interactions between ER and lysosomes. We describe simple fluorescence-based methods that allow the interplay between Ca2+ signals, the ER, and lysosomes to be examined.

Abstract: The microenvironment of tumor cells is critically involved in tumor development and progression. Tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) represent a major constituent of the tumor stroma. Tumor cells are operative in the activation of TAFs, whereas TAFs in turn contribute to tumor cell malignancy. This report describes mechanisms of communication between fibroblasts and urinary bladder cancer (UBC) cells. Migration of bladder cancer cell lines RT112 and Cal-29, representing two different grades of dedifferentiation, was enhanced by cocultivation with TAFs. Conditioned medium from tumor cells induced the release of interleukin (IL)-8, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), matrix metalloproteinase-2, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 by TAFs. Tumor cell-derived IL-1α was identified as a major mediator of these stimulatory effects. Fibroblasts, on the other hand, exerted a migration and invasion stimulating influence on UBC cells. MCP-1 and HGF were shown to promote cell migration of both bladder cancer cell lines.

Abstract: The use of Xenopus embryonic skin as a model system for the development of ciliated epithelia is well established. This tissue is comprised of numerous cell types, most notably the multiciliated cells (MCCs) that each contain approximately 150 motile cilia. At the base of each cilium lies the centriole-based structure called the basal body. Centriole biogenesis is typically restricted to two new centrioles per cell cycle, each templating from an existing “mother” centriole. In contrast, MCCs are post-mitotic cells in which the majority of centrioles arise “de novo” without templating from a mother centriole, instead, these centrioles nucleate from an electron-dense structure termed the deuterostome. How centriole number is regulated in these cells and the mechanism by which the deuterosome templates nascent centrioles is still poorly understood. Here, we describe methods for regulating MCC cell fate as well as for visualizing and manipulating centriole biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
In plants, host response to pathogenic microbes is driven both by microbial perception and detection of modified-self. The Xanthomonas campestris effector protein AvrAC/XopAC uridylylates the Arabidopsis BIK1 kinase to dampen basal resistance and thereby promotes bacterial virulence. Here we show that PBL2, a paralog of BIK1, is similarly uridylylated by AvrAC. However, in contrast to BIK1, PBL2 uridylylation is specifically required for host recognition of AvrAC to trigger immunity, but not AvrAC virulence. PBL2 thus acts as a decoy and enables AvrAC detection. AvrAC recognition also requires the RKS1 pseudokinase of the ZRK family and the NOD-like receptor ZAR1, which is known to recognize the Pseudomonas syringae effector HopZ1a. ZAR1 forms a stable complex with RKS1, which specifically recruits PBL2 when the latter is uridylylated by AvrAC, triggering ZAR1-mediated immunity. The results illustrate how decoy substrates and pseudokinases can specify and expand the capacity of the plant immune system.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal mucus layer provides a barrier limiting bacterial contact with the underlying epithelium. Mucus structure is shaped by intestinal location and the microbiota. To understand how commensals modulate gut mucus, we examined mucus properties under germ-free (GF) conditions and during microbial colonization. Although the colon mucus organization of GF mice was similar to that of conventionally raised (Convr) mice, the GF inner mucus layer was penetrable to bacteria-sized beads. During colonization, in which GF mice were gavaged with Convr microbiota, the small intestine mucus required 5 weeks to be normally detached and colonic inner mucus 6 weeks to become impenetrable. The composition of the small intestinal microbiota during colonization was similar to Convr donors until 3 weeks, when Bacteroides increased, Firmicutes decreased, and segmented filamentous bacteria became undetectable. These findings highlight the dynamics of mucus layer development and indicate that studies of mature microbe-mucus interactions should be conducted weeks after colonization.

Abstract: Summary
Tumorigenic potential of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is an important issue in clinical applications. Despite many efforts, PSC-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) have repeatedly induced tumors in animal models even though pluripotent cells were not detected. We found that polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)− cells among the early NPCs caused tumors, whereas PSA-NCAM+ cells were nontumorigenic. Molecular profiling, global gene analysis, and multilineage differentiation of PSA-NCAM− cells confirm that they are multipotent neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) that could differentiate into both ectodermal and mesodermal lineages. Transplantation of PSA-NCAM− cells in a gradient manner mixed with PSA-NCAM+ cells proportionally increased mesodermal tumor formation and unwanted grafts such as PERIPHERIN+ cells or pigmented cells in the rat brain. Therefore, we suggest that NCSCs are a critical target for tumor prevention in hPSC-derived NPCs, and removal of PSA-NCAM− cells eliminates the tumorigenic potential originating from NCSCs after transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of myopathies, characterized by muscle weakness and degeneration, without curative treatment. Mesoangioblasts (MABs) have been proposed as a potential regenerative therapy. To improve our understanding of the in vivo behavior of MABs and the effect of different immunosuppressive therapies, like cyclosporine A or co-stimulation-adhesion blockade therapy, on cell survival noninvasive cell monitoring is required. Therefore, cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding firefly luciferase (Fluc) and the human sodium iodide transporter (hNIS) to allow cell monitoring via bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and small-animal positron emission tomography (PET). Non-H2 matched mMABs were injected in the femoral artery of dystrophic mice and were clearly visible via small-animal PET and BLI. Based on noninvasive imaging data, we were able to show that co-stim was clearly superior to CsA in reducing cell rejection and this was mediated via a reduction in cytotoxic T cells and upregulation of regulatory T cells.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamics and interactions between stem cell pools in the hair follicle (HF), sebaceous gland (SG), and interfollicular epidermis (IFE) of murine skin are still poorly understood. In this study, we used multicolor lineage tracing to mark Lgr6-expressing basal cells in the HF isthmus, SG, and IFE. We show that these Lgr6+ cells constitute long-term self-renewing populations within each compartment in adult skin. Quantitative analysis of clonal dynamics revealed that the Lgr6+ progenitor cells compete neutrally in the IFE, isthmus, and SG, indicating population asymmetry as the underlying mode of tissue renewal. Transcriptional profiling of Lgr6+ and Lgr6− cells did not reveal a distinct Lgr6-associated gene expression signature, raising the question of whether Lgr6 expression requires extrinsic niche signals. Our results elucidate the interrelation and behavior of Lgr6+ populations in the IFE, HF, and SG and suggest population asymmetry as a common mechanism for homeostasis in several epithelial skin compartments.

Abstract: Summary
Symmetric and asymmetric divisions are important for self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells during neurogenesis. Although cerebellar granule neurogenesis is controlled by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, whether and how this process is mediated by regulation of cell division modes have not been determined. Here, using time-lapse imaging and cell culture from neuronal progenitor-specific and differentiated neuron-specific reporter mouse lines (Math1-GFP and Dcx-DsRed) and Patched+/− mice in which SHH signaling is activated, we find evidence for the existence of symmetric and asymmetric divisions that are closely associated with progenitor proliferation and differentiation. While activation of the SHH pathway enhances symmetric progenitor cell divisions, blockade of the SHH pathway reverses the cell division mode change in Math1-GFP;Dcx-DsRed;Patched+/− mice by promoting asymmetric divisions or terminal neuronal symmetric divisions. Thus, cell division mode change mediates the regulation of cerebellar granule neurogenesis controlled by SHH signaling.

Abstract: Phagocytosis is a critical biological activity through which the host can protect itself from infectious and non-infectious environmental particles and remove unwanted host cells in order to maintain tissue homeostasis. Phagocytosis is an ancient, conserved process that is apparent in all multicellular organisms. The process of phagocytosis requires the recognition of ligands on particles by specific receptors expressed by the phagocyte that promote internalization via reorganization of cytoskeletal elements and directed formation of the phagosome. Subsequent phagosome–lysosome fusion delivers the contents for destruction and recycling in the acidic compartment. Significantly, receptor engagement and uptake can also trigger intracellular signaling pathways that initiate appropriate innate immune and pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses dependent upon the nature of the particle. The important benefits of phagocytosis to host survival are exemplified by the detrimental effects to health that occur when phagocytic efficiency is diminished. In an overview, we discuss the different experimental approaches or options that can be considered when investigating and determining the characteristics and quantification of phagocytic activity. These criteria will include choice of phagocytic cell type, selection, and method of labeling of particle for monitoring internalization, targeting of particles to specific receptors, and quantification of ingestion either at the single cell or at the population level. We provide two detailed examples of phagocytosis assays.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation from latent neuronal infection requires stimulation of lytic gene expression from promoters associated with repressive heterochromatin. Various neuronal stresses trigger reactivation, but how these stimuli activate silenced promoters remains unknown. We show that a neuronal pathway involving activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), common to many stress responses, is essential for initial HSV gene expression during reactivation. This JNK activation in neurons is mediated by dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) and JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), which direct JNK toward stress responses instead of other cellular functions. Surprisingly, JNK-mediated viral gene induction occurs independently of histone demethylases that remove repressive lysine modifications. Rather, JNK signaling results in a histone methyl/phospho switch on HSV lytic promoters, a mechanism permitting gene expression in the presence of repressive lysine methylation. JNK is present on viral promoters during reactivation, thereby linking a neuronal-specific stress pathway and HSV reactivation from latency.

Abstract: Abnormal bone formation is a clinically significant dilemma for many conditions in response to injury, inflammation or genetic disease. However, the effects of inflammation on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remain unclear. IL-23 secretion from macrophages might contribute to the development of bone formation. Here, we investigated the stimulatory effects of THP-1 macrophage conditioned medium (MΦ CM) on the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs and the associated signaling pathways. The osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was induced after exposure to osteogenic differentiation medium (OM). MΦ CM significantly increased alkaline phosphate (ALP) activity and calcium mineralization in MSCs. Osteogenic marker genes, including RUNX2, ALP and osteocalcin (OCN), were also up-regulated in MSCs after exposure to MΦ CM. Moreover, western blotting revealed that MΦ CM treatment induced STAT3 and β-catenin activation in MSCs. Furthermore, blockade of IL-23 in MΦ CM not only impaired the osteogenic-promotion effects of macrophage but also decreased the expression of osteogenic maker genes. However, IL-23R silencing suppressed MΦ CM-induced calcium mineralization and osteogenic maker gene expression in MSCs. These data suggest that macrophages derived from THP-1 promote the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs through the IL-23/IL-23R/β-catenin pathway and macrophages might contribute to the development of bone formation in inflammation.

Abstract: Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSC) therapy may be promising for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders (IBDs). However, clinical success remains poor, partly explained by limited HSC recruitment following systemic delivery. The mechanisms governing HSC adhesion within inflamed colon, and whether this event can be enhanced, are not known. An immortalised HSC-like line (HPC7) was pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), activated platelet releasate enriched supernatant (PES) or platelet microparticles (PMPs). Subsequent adhesion was monitored using adhesion assays or in vivo ischaemia–reperfusion (IR) and colitis injured mouse colon intravitally. Integrin clustering was determined confocally and cell morphology using scanning electron microscopy. Both injuries resulted in increased HPC7 adhesion within colonic mucosal microcirculation. H2O2 and PES significantly enhanced adhesion in vitro and in the colitis, but not IR injured, colon. PMPs had no effect on adhesion. PES and PMPs induced clustering of integrins on the HPC7 surface, but did not alter their expression. Adhesion to the colon is modulated by injury but only in colitis injury can this recruitment be enhanced. The enhanced adhesion induced by PES is likely through integrin distribution changes on the HPC7 surface. Improving local HSC presence in injured colon may result in better therapeutic efficacy for treatment of IBD.

Abstract: Here, we describe a detailed protocol, based on laser ablation and fluorescence optical microscopy, to measure the microtubule organization in spindles, including microtubule length distribution, polarity, and plus and minus end densities. The method uses the asymmetry in microtubule depolymerization after a cut, where the newly created microtubule plus ends depolymerize all the way to the minus ends, whereas the newly created minus ends remain stable. The protocol described in this chapter is optimized for spindles, but can be easily applied to any microtubule-based structure. The chapter is divided into two parts. First, we provide the theoretical basis for the method. Second, we describe in detail all steps necessary to reconstruct the microtubule organization of a spindle assembled in Xenopus laevis egg extract. Compared to electron microscopy, which in theory can resolve individual microtubules in spindles and provide similar structural information, our method is fast and simple enough to allow for a full quantitative reconstruction of the microtubule organization of several X. laevis spindles—which have volumes tens of thousands of times larger than spindles whose structures have been previously solved by electron microscopy—in a single experimental session, as well as to explore how the architecture of these structures changes in response to biochemical perturbations.

Abstract: The PI3K–AKT pathway is expected to be a therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. We previously reported that a novel PI3K inhibitor iMDK suppressed NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo without harming normal cells and mice. Unexpectedly, iMDK activated the MAPK pathway, including ERK, in the NSCLC cells. Since iMDK did not eradicate such NSCLC cells completely, it is possible that the activated MAPK pathway confers resistance to the NSCLC cells against cell death induced by iMDK. In the present study, we assessed whether suppressing of iMDK-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway would enhance anti-tumorigenic activity of iMDK. PD0325901, a MAPK inhibitor, suppressed the MAPK pathway induced by iMDK and cooperatively inhibited cell viability and colony formation of NSCLC cells by inducing apoptosis in vitro. HUVEC tube formation, representing angiogenic processes in vitro, was also cooperatively inhibited by the combinatorial treatment of iMDK and PD0325901. The combinatorial treatment of iMDK with PD0325901 cooperatively suppressed tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis in a lung cancer xenograft model in vivo. Here, we demonstrate a novel treatment strategy using iMDK and PD0325901 to eradicate NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens that evade adaptive immunity typically exhibit antigenic variation. By contrast, it appears that although the chronic human tuberculosis (TB)-causing pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis needs to counter host T cell responses, its T cell epitopes are hyperconserved. Here we present an extensive analysis of the T cell epitopes of M. tuberculosis. We combined population genomics with experimental immunology to determine the number and identity of T cell epitope sequence variants in 216 phylogenetically diverse strains of M. tuberculosis. Antigen conservation is indeed a hallmark of M. tuberculosis. However, our analysis revealed a set of seven variable antigens that were immunogenic in subjects with active TB. These findings suggest that M. tuberculosis uses mechanisms other than antigenic variation to evade T cells. T cell epitopes that exhibit sequence variation may not be subject to the same evasion mechanisms, and hence vaccines that include such variable epitopes may be more efficacious.

Abstract: Summary
Altered commensal communities are associated with human disease. IgA mediates intestinal homeostasis and regulates microbiota composition. Intestinal IgA is produced at high levels as a result of T follicular helper cell (TFH) and B cell interactions in germinal centers. However, the pathways directing host IgA responses toward the microbiota remain unknown. Here, we report that signaling through the innate adaptor MyD88 in gut T cells coordinates germinal center responses, including TFH and IgA+ B cell development. TFH development is deficient in germ-free mice and can be restored by feeding TLR2 agonists that activate T cell-intrinsic MyD88 signaling. Loss of this pathway diminishes high-affinity IgA targeting of the microbiota and fails to control the bacterial community, leading to worsened disease. Our findings identify that T cells converge innate and adaptive immune signals to coordinate IgA against the microbiota, constraining microbial community membership to promote symbiosis.

Abstract: In this chapter, we describe the current methods of examining the structure of centrosomes by fluorescence subdiffraction microscopy. By using recently developed microscopy techniques, centrosomal proteins can now be examined in cells with a resolution of only a few nanometers, a level of molecular detail beyond the reach of traditional cell biology methods as confocal and widefield microscopy. We emphasize imaging by three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, and quantitative approaches to image data analysis.

Abstract: Summary
The nasopharynx (NP) is a reservoir for microbes associated with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Lung inflammation resulting from ARIs during infancy is linked to asthma development. We examined the NP microbiome during the critical first year of life in a prospective cohort of 234 children, capturing both the viral and bacterial communities and documenting all incidents of ARIs. Most infants were initially colonized with Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium before stable colonization with Alloiococcus or Moraxella. Transient incursions of Streptococcus, Moraxella, or Haemophilus marked virus-associated ARIs. Our data identify the NP microbiome as a determinant for infection spread to the lower airways, severity of accompanying inflammatory symptoms, and risk for future asthma development. Early asymptomatic colonization with Streptococcus was a strong asthma predictor, and antibiotic usage disrupted asymptomatic colonization patterns. In the absence of effective anti-viral therapies, targeting pathogenic bacteria within the NP microbiome could represent a prophylactic approach to asthma.

Abstract: Summary
FLT3 and c-KIT are crucial regulators of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We investigated the role of STS1 and STS2 on FLT3 and c-KIT phosphorylation, activity, and function in normal and stress-induced hematopoiesis. STS1/STS2-deficient mice show a profound expansion of multipotent progenitor and lymphoid primed multipotent progenitor cells with elevated colony-forming capacity. Although long-term hematopoietic stem cells are not increased in numbers, lack of STS1 and STS2 significantly promotes long-term repopulation activity, demonstrating a pivotal role of STS1/STS2 in regulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fitness. Biochemical analysis identified STS1/STS2 as direct phosphatases of FLT3 and c-KIT. Loss of STS1/STS2 induces hyperphosphorylation of FLT3, enhances AKT signaling, and confers a strong proliferative advantage. Therefore, our study reveals that STS1 and STS2 may serve as novel pharmaceutical targets to improve hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation.

Abstract: Joint contracture is a fibroproliferative disorder that restricts joint mobility, resulting in tissue degeneration and deformity. However, the etiology of joint contracture is still unknown. Chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide subunit eta (CCT-eta) is reported to increase in fibrotic diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether CCT-eta is implicated in joint contracture and to determine the role of CCT-eta in the progression of joint contracture by analyzing a rat model. We immobilized the left knee joint of rat by internal fixation for 8 weeks. The non-immobilized right leg served as a control. The range of motion (ROM) of the knee was investigated. Fibroblasts were obtained from the posterior joint capsule of the joints. The outcome was followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, fibroblast migration assay, and collagen assay. The effect of CCT-eta on the functions of fibroblasts was observed by utilizing a short inhibitory RNA (siRNA) targeting CCT-eta. The ROM of the immobilized joints was significantly limited compared to the contralateral joints (p < 0.05). Fibroblasts derived from the contractive joints showed higher mRNA and protein expressions of CCT-eta in parallel with alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) compared to the cells from the contralateral knees (p < 0.05). siRNA-mediated downregulation of CCT-eta inhibited the expressions of both CCT-eta and α-SMA. Moreover, the reduction of CCT-eta also significantly decreased fibroblast functions such as cell mobility and collagen synthesis (all p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that CCT-eta appears to be a potential marker of joint contracture disease.

Abstract: The chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotic cells begins at replication initation sites, which are marked by the assembly of the pre-replication complexes in early G1. At the G1/S transition, recruitment of additional replication initiation proteins enables origin DNA unwinding and loading of DNA polymerases. We found that depletion of the human DNA helicase B (HDHB) inhibits the initiation of DNA replication, suggesting a role of HDHB in the beginning of the DNA synthesis. To gain insight into the function of HDHB during replication initiation, we examined the physical interactions of purified recombinant HDHB with key initiation proteins. HDHB interacts directly with two initiation factors TopBP1 and Cdc45. In addition we found that both, the N-terminus and helicase domain of HDHB bind to the N-terminus of Cdc45. Furthermore depletion of HDHB from human cells diminishes Cdc45 association with chromatin, suggesting that HDHB may facilitate Cdc45 recruitment at G1/S in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Isolation of ventricular cardiomyocytes (vCMs) has been challenging due to the lack of specific surface markers. Here we show that vCMs can be purified from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using molecular beacons (MBs) targeting specific intracellular mRNAs. We designed MBs (IRX4 MBs) to target mRNA encoding Iroquois homeobox protein 4 (Irx4), a transcription factor specific for vCMs. To purify mESC vCMs, IRX4 MBs were delivered into cardiomyogenically differentiating mESCs, and IRX4 MBs-positive cells were FACS-sorted. We found that, of the cells isolated, ∼98% displayed vCM-like action potentials by electrophysiological analyses. These MB-purified vCMs continuously maintained their CM characteristics as verified by spontaneous beating, Ca2+ transient, and expression of vCM-specific proteins. Our study shows the feasibility of isolating pure vCMs via cell sorting without modifying host genes. The homogeneous and functional ventricular CMs generated via the MB-based method can be useful for disease investigation, drug discovery, and cell-based therapies.

Abstract: The post-traumatic hypertrophic scar (HS) is a fibrotic disease with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production by fibroblasts in response to tissue injury. Although dysregulation of miRNAs is known to be involved in a variety of pathophysiologic processes, the role of miRNA in hypertrophic scar formation is unclear. Abnormal expression of miRNA in fibrosis has been investigated in several studies. The transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) promotes fibroblasts proliferation, the synthesis of collagen and other extracellular matrix, and ultimately leads to the formation of the HS by inducing excessive deposition of ECM. We identified two miRNAs whose expression was correlated with fibrotic diseases: miR-21 and miR-200b. This study further confirmed that after stimulation with TGF-β1, the expression of miR-21 was increased, whereas the mRNA level of SMAD7 was decreased in fibroblasts. TGF-β1 reduced the expression of miR-200b, while it augmented that of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1(Zeb1). Our experiments demonstrated that the expression of miR-21 and miR-200b are related to a disorder, and the TGF-β/miR-21/Smad7 and TGF-β/miR200b/Zeb1 pathways might participate in the pathogenesis of HS. Thus, a novel, beyond the traditional methods, approach for HS treatment via miRNA therapeutics could have been provided.

Abstract: Bacteria have long been ideal model systems for studying many biological phenomena. But when it comes to motility, we are quite often just figuring out the mechanisms underlying their ability to move in liquid or on surfaces. In the last few decades, research has emphasized the importance for bacteria to be able to adhere to and move on surfaces in order to form complex bacterial communities called biofilms. To better understand the multiple chemical and biophysical mechanisms responsible for the initial interactions of bacteria on surfaces that develop into biofilms, we present here low-cost and easy-to-implement protocols to quantitatively analyze the movement of single bacteria on surfaces by microscopy. These protocols are presented in the case of the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae that moves on surfaces solely powered by Type IV pili, motility referred to as twitching motility. These methods, however, are applicable for any motile bacteria interacting with surfaces. The precise quantification of motility coupled with genetic tools will enable us to precisely dissect the mechanisms and dynamics of bacterial surface motility which are still poorly understood.

Abstract: We describe the reconstitution of dynamic cortical actin networks within cell-like compartments. The approach is based on encapsulation of Xenopus egg extract within water-in-oil emulsions. The growth of cortical actin networks is catalyzed by an amphiphilic actin nucleation-promoting factor that localizes to the water/oil interface. We first describe the preparation of cell-free Xenopus egg extract that provides all the soluble components of the actin machinery. We then describe the preparation of the amphiphilic, fluorescent actin nucleation-promoting factor that directs actin polymerization to the interface. Finally, we describe the steps required for assembly of dynamic actin cortices within water-in-oil emulsions, including the emulsification process and the sample preparation procedures. We provide recommendations for handling sensitive system components and discuss potential uses of this reconstitution approach for cytoskeletal research.

Abstract: Parkinson׳s disease (PD), among the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide for which there is no cure, is characterized as progressive dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra through an unknown mechanism. Administering 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) causes neuronal cell death and Parkinsonism in humans. Commonly used in animal models of PD, MPTP can metabolize to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+); however, the detailed mechanism through which MPP+ causes neuronal cell death remains undetermined. Previous reports have indicated those knockout mice with Bcl-2 associated protein X (Bax) or caspase-2, two mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization inducers, are resistant to MPTP administration, suggesting that mitochondria are involved in MPP+-triggered apoptosis. Our previous study showed that MPP+-triggered apoptosis can be distinguished from spontaneous apoptosis of primary cortical neurons. In the present study, we verified the involvement of mitochondria in MPP+-induced and spontaneous apoptosis in cortical neurons through confocal microscope analysis. We demonstrated that caspase-2 activation is specific to MPP+-induced apoptosis and occurs before Bax translocation to the mitochondria. Caspase-2 activation is one of the few early molecular events identified in PD models.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) and their progenitors have been identified based on retrospective functional criteria. CD markers are employed to define cell populations with distinct functional characteristics. However, defining and prospective isolation of BMSCs and committed progenitors are lacking. Here, we compared the transcriptome profile of CD markers expressed at baseline and during the course of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation of two well-characterized osteogenic-committed murine BMSCs (mBMSCBone) and adipogenic-committed mBMSCs (mBMSCAdipo), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of a core set of canonical mBMSC CD markers with comparable expression levels in mBMSCBone and mBMSCAdipo at baseline and during their differentiation. We identified 11 CD markers that are differentially expressed between mBMSCAdipo and mBMSCBone. Among these, we identified osteoprogenitor-associated CD markers expressed only in mBMSCBone: CD34, CD54, CD73, CD132, CD200, CD227 and adipoprogenitor-associated CD markers expressed only in mBMSCAdipo: CD53, CD80, CD134, CD141 and CD212. FACS analysis confirmed these results. We selected CD34 for further analysis. CD34 was expressed at baseline of mouse stromal cell line ST2, primary mBMSCs, mBMSCBone and its expression decreased during osteoblast differentiation. FACS-sorted CD34+ primary mBMSCs exhibited higher expression of 70% osteoblast-associated genes, and formed significantly higher heterotopic bone in vivo when implanted subcutaneously in immune-deficient mice compared with CD34− primary mBMSCs. Our results demonstrate that a set of CD markers can distinguish osteoprogenitor versus adipoprogenitor populations of mBMSCs. CD34 is suitable for prospective isolation of mouse bone marrow osteoprogenitors.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and the concurrent development of protocols for their cell-type-specific differentiation have revolutionized our approach to cell therapy. It has now become critical to address the challenges related to the generation of iPSCs under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) compliant conditions, including tissue sourcing, manufacturing, testing, and storage. Furthermore, regarding the technical challenges, it is very important to keep the costs of manufacturing and testing reasonable and solve logistic hurdles that permit the global distribution of these products. Here we describe our efforts to develop a process for the manufacturing of iPSC master cell banks (MCBs) under cGMPs and announce the availability of such banks.

Abstract: Here, we describe the general principles of RNA interference screens to study lysosomal functions in mammalian cells. Lysosomes occupy a central position in the biology of numerous processes such as degradation, microbial killing, and immunological antigen presentation to T cells. Selection of a screening system, conducting pooled versus arrayed screens, and appropriate steps in assay development, validation, and verification of novel gene candidates are all discussed. We focus on our experience in developing an arrayed short hairpin RNA screen to identify novel lysosomal trafficking proteins involved in vesicle and cargo trafficking and illustrate how such a trafficking library can be applied to screens involving lysosomes.

Abstract: Pitx2 is a bicoid-related homeobox transcription factor implicated in regulating left–right patterning and organogenesis. However, only a limited number of Pitx2 downstream target genes have been identified and characterized. Here we demonstrate that Pitx2 is a transcriptional repressor of DEP domain containing 1B (DEPDC1B). The first intron of the human and mouse DEP domain containing 1B genes contains multiple consensus DNA-binding sites for Pitx2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Pitx2, along with histone deacetylase 1, was recruited to the first intron of Depdc1b. In contrast, RNAi-mediated depletion of Pitx2 not only enhanced the acetylation of histone H4 in the first intron of Depdc1b, but also increased the protein level of Depdc1b. Luciferase reporter assays also showed that Pitx2 could repress the transcriptional activity mediated by the first intron of human DEPDC1B. The GAP domain of DEPDC1B interacted with nucleotide-bound forms of RAC1 in vitro. In addition, exogenous expression of DEPDC1B suppressed RAC1 activation and interfered with actin polymerization induced by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor TRIO. Moreover, DEPDC1B interacted with various signaling molecules such as U2af2, Erh, and Salm. We propose that Pitx2-mediated repression of Depdc1b expression contributes to the regulation of multiple molecular pathways, such as Rho GTPase signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The orphan nuclear receptor TLX is a master regulator of postnatal neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal and neurogenesis; however, it remains unclear how TLX expression is precisely regulated in these tissue-specific stem cells. Here, we show that a highly conserved cis-element within the Tlx locus functions to drive gene expression in NSCs. We demonstrate that the transcription factors SOX2 and MYT1 specifically interact with this genomic element to directly regulate Tlx enhancer activity in vivo. Knockdown experiments further reveal that SOX2 dominantly controls endogenous expression of TLX, whereas MYT1 only plays a modulatory role. Importantly, TLX is essential for SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming of astrocytes and itself is also sufficient to induce neurogenesis in the adult striatum. Together, these findings unveil functional genetic interactions among transcription factors that are critical to NSCs and in vivo cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma is a highly lethal cancer for which novel therapeutics are urgently needed. Two distinct subtypes of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) were recently identified: mesenchymal (MES) and proneural (PN). To identify mechanisms to target the more aggressive MES GSCs, we combined transcriptomic expression analysis and kinome-wide short hairpin RNA screening of MES and PN GSCs. In comparison to PN GSCs, we found significant upregulation and phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in MES GSCs. Knockdown of AXL significantly decreased MES GSC self-renewal capacity in vitro and inhibited the growth of glioblastoma patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, inhibition of AXL with shRNA or pharmacologic inhibitors also increased cell death significantly more in MES GSCs. Clinically, AXL expression was elevated in the MES GBM subtype and significantly correlated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers. In conclusion, we identified AXL as a potential molecular target for novel approaches to treat glioblastoma and other solid cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Biofilms—communities of bacteria encased in a polymer-rich matrix—confer bacteria with the ability to persist in pathologic host contexts, such as the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. How bacteria assemble polymers into biofilms is largely unknown. We find that the extracellular matrix produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa self-assembles into a liquid crystal through entropic interactions between polymers and filamentous Pf bacteriophages, which are long, negatively charged filaments. This liquid crystalline structure enhances biofilm function by increasing adhesion and tolerance to desiccation and antibiotics. Pf bacteriophages are prevalent among P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and were detected in CF sputum. The addition of Pf bacteriophage to sputum polymers or serum was sufficient to drive their rapid assembly into viscous liquid crystals. Fd, a related bacteriophage of Escherichia coli, has similar biofilm-building capabilities. Targeting filamentous bacteriophage or the liquid crystalline organization of the biofilm matrix may represent antibacterial strategies.

Abstract: RhoD is a member of the Rho GTPase family and it coordinates actin dynamics and membrane trafficking. Activation of RhoD results in formation of filopodia, dissolution of stress fibers, and the subsequent formation of short actin bundles. In addition, RhoD localizes to early endosomes and recycling endosomes, and has a regulatory role in endosome trafficking. In this study, we report on a function of RhoD in the regulation of Golgi homeostasis. We show that manipulation of protein and activation levels of RhoD, as well as of its binding partner WHAMM, result in derailed localization of Golgi stacks. Moreover, vesicle trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus measured by the VSV-G protein is severely hampered by manipulation of RhoD or WHAMM. In summary, our studies demonstrate a novel role for this member of the Rho GTPases in the regulation of Golgi function.

Abstract: HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) is a well-known long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) whose dysregulation correlates with poor prognosis and malignant progression in many forms of cancer. Here, we investigate the expression pattern, clinical significance, and biological function of HOTAIR in serous ovarian cancer (SOC). Clinically, we found that HOTAIR levels were overexpressed in SOC tissues compared with normal controls and that HOTAIR overexpression was correlated with an advanced FIGO stage and a high histological grade. Multivariate analysis revealed that HOTAIR is an independent prognostic factor for predicting overall survival in SOC patients. We demonstrated that HOTAIR silencing inhibited A2780 and OVCA429 SOC cell proliferation in vitro and that the anti-proliferative effects of HOTAIR silencing also occurred in vivo. Further investigation into the mechanisms responsible for the growth inhibitory effects by HOTAIR silencing revealed that its knockdown resulted in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through certain cell cycle-related and apoptosis-related proteins. Together, these results highlight a critical role of HOTAIR in SOC cell proliferation and contribute to a better understanding of the importance of dysregulated lncRNAs in SOC progression.

Abstract: Selenium (Se) is necessary for the immune system in chicken and mediates its physiological functions through selenoproteins. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are indispensable for maintaining normal cell function and for directing the immune response. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Se deficiency on the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of selenoproteins and Hsps as well as immune functions in the chicken bursa of Fabricius. Two groups of chickens, namely the control and Se-deficient (L group) groups, were reared for 55 days. The chickens were offered a basal diet, which contained 0.15 mg Se/kg in the diet fed to the control group and 0.033 mg Se/kg in the diet fed to the L group. We performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactionto detect the mRNA expression levels of selenoproteins and Hsps on days 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expression levels of Hsps on days 35, 45 and 55, and immune functions were assessed through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on days 15, 35, and 55. The data showed that the mRNA expression levels of selenoproteins, such as Txnrd1, Txnrd2, Txnrd3, Dio1, Dio2, Dio3, GPx1, GPx2, GPx3 GPx4, Sepp1, Selo, Sel-15, Sepx1, Sels, Seli, Selu, Selh, and SPS2, were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the L group compared with the control group. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Hsps (Hsp27, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90) were also significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the L group. The expression levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-1β, IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ were significantly lower (P < 0.05) and TNF-α was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the L group compared with the control group. Our results show that immunosuppression was accompanied by a downregulation of mRNA expression levels of selenoproteins and an upregulation of the Hsp mRNA expression levels. Thus, Se deficiency causes defects in the chicken bursa of Fabricius, and selenoproteins and Hsps play important roles in immunosuppression in the bursa of Fabricius of chickens with Se deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an established antiepileptic drug, has been reported to impair postnatal cognitive function in children born to VPA-treated epileptic mothers. However, how these defects arise and how they can be overcome remain unknown. Using mice, we found that comparable postnatal cognitive functional impairment is very likely correlated to the untimely enhancement of embryonic neurogenesis, which led to depletion of the neural precursor cell pool and consequently a decreased level of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Moreover, hippocampal neurons in the offspring of VPA-treated mice showed abnormal morphology and activity. Surprisingly, these impairments could be ameliorated by voluntary running. Our study suggests that although prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs such as VPA may have detrimental effects that persist until adulthood, these effects may be offset by a simple physical activity such as running.

Abstract: Radiation-induced cellular injury is attributed primarily to the harmful effects of free radicals, which play a key role in irradiation-induced apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the radioprotective efficacy of edaravone, a licensed clinical drug and a powerful free radical scavenger that has been tested against γ-irradiation-induced cellular damage in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes in studies of various diseases. Edaravone was pre-incubated with lymphocytes for 2 h prior to γ-irradiation. It was found that pretreatment with edaravone increased cell viability and inhibited generation of γ-radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lymphocytes exposed to 3 Gy γ-radiation. In addition, γ-radiation decreased antioxidant enzymatic activity, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as the level of reduced glutathione. Conversely, treatment with 100μm edaravone prior to irradiation improved antioxidant enzyme activity and increased reduced glutathione levels in irradiated lymphocytes. Importantly, we also report that edaravone reduced γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis through downregulation of Bax, upregulation of Bcl-2, and consequent reduction of the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio. The current study shows edaravone to be an effective radioprotector against γ-irradiation-induced cellular damage in lymphocytes in vitro. Finally, edaravone pretreatment significantly reduced DNA damage in γ-irradiated lymphocytes, as measured by comet assay (% tail DNA, tail length, tail moment, and olive tail moment) (p < 0.05). Thus, the current study indicates that edaravone offers protection from radiation-induced cytogenetic alterations.

Abstract: The EphB4 receptor tyrosine kinase is over-expressed in a variety of different epithelial cancers including prostate where it has been shown to be involved in survival, migration and angiogenesis. We report here that EphB4 also resides in the nucleus of prostate cancer cell lines. We used in silico methods to identify a bipartite nuclear localisation signal (NLS) in the extracellular domain and a monopartite NLS sequence in the intracellular kinase domain of EphB4. To determine whether both putative NLS sequences were functional, fragments of the EphB4 sequence containing each NLS were cloned to create EphB4NLS-GFP fusion proteins. Localisation of both NLS-GFP proteins to the nuclei of transfected cells was observed, demonstrating that EphB4 contains two functional NLS sequences. Mutation of the key amino residues in both NLS sequences resulted in diminished nuclear accumulation. As nuclear translocation is often dependent on importins we confirmed that EphB4 and importin-α can interact. To assess if nuclear EphB4 could be implicated in gene regulatory functions potential EphB4-binding genomic loci were identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation and Lef1 was confirmed as a potential target of EphB4-mediated gene regulation. These novel findings add further complexity to the biology of this important cancer-associated receptor.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal composition of intestinal bacteria—“dysbiosis”—is characteristic of Crohn’s disease. Disease treatments include dietary changes and immunosuppressive anti-TNFα antibodies as well as ancillary antibiotic therapy, but their effects on microbiota composition are undetermined. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed fecal samples from a prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn’s disease patients starting therapy with enteral nutrition or anti-TNFα antibodies and reveal the full complement and dynamics of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses during treatment. Bacterial community membership was associated independently with intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and therapy. Antibiotic exposure was associated with increased dysbiosis, whereas dysbiosis decreased with reduced intestinal inflammation. Fungal proportions increased with disease and antibiotic use. Dietary therapy had independent and rapid effects on microbiota composition distinct from other stressor-induced changes and effectively reduced inflammation. These findings reveal that dysbiosis results from independent effects of inflammation, diet, and antibiotics and shed light on Crohn disease treatments.

Abstract: Glipizide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, has been widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, it is controversial whether or not glipizide would affect angiogenesis or vasculogenesis. In the present study, we used early chick embryo model to investigate the effect of glipizide on angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, which are the two major processes for embryonic vasculature formation as well as tumor neovascularization. We found that Glipizide suppressed both angiogenesis in yolk-sac membrane (YSM) and blood island formation during developmental vasculogenesis. Glipizide did not affect either the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) or mesoderm cell migration. In addition, it did not interfere with separation of smooth muscle cell progenitors from hemangioblasts. Moreover, natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) has been identified as the putative target for glipizide׳s inhibitory effect on vasculogenesis. When NPRA was overexpressed or activated, blood island formation was reduced. NPRA signaling may play a crucial role in the effect of glipizide on vasculogenesis during early embryonic development.

Abstract: For some time, it has been known that recycling endosomes (REs) are organized in a nebulous “pericentrosomal” region in interphase cells. However, the collective use of previously developed methods, including centrosome isolation, live cell imaging, and electron microscopy, suggested that there is much more going on between the centrosome and the RE than previously imagined. By exploiting these approaches, we uncovered novel roles of the centrosome in RE function and, conversely, novel roles for REs in centrosome function. We first found that REs dynamically localized to the centrosome throughout the cell cycle. More specifically, we found that REs interacted with appendages of the older centriole in interphase cells to control endosome recycling, and this interaction was governed by RE-machinery including the small GTPase Rab11. We next determined that REs carry centrosome proteins to spindle poles as part of the “centrosome maturation” process. Here we discuss the methods used and materials needed to complete these types of studies.

Abstract: Summary
Protein ubiquitination plays key roles in protein turnover, cellular signaling, and intracellular transport. The genome of Toxoplasma gondii encodes ubiquitination machinery, but the roles of this posttranslational modification (PTM) are unknown. To examine the prevalence and function of ubiquitination in T. gondii, we mapped the ubiquitin proteome of tachyzoites. Over 500 ubiquitin-modified proteins, with almost 1,000 sites, were identified on proteins with diverse localizations and functions. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that 35% of ubiquitinated proteins are cell-cycle regulated. Unexpectedly, most classic cell-cycle regulators conserved in T. gondii were not detected in the ubiquitinome. Furthermore, many ubiquitinated proteins localize to the cytoskeleton and inner membrane complex, a structure beneath the plasma membrane facilitating division and host invasion. Comparing the ubiquitinome with other PTM proteomes reveals waves of PTM enrichment during the cell cycle. Thus, T. gondii PTMs are implicated as critical regulators of cell division and cell-cycle transitions.

Abstract: When environmental temperatures exceed a certain threshold, the upregulation of the ovine HSP90AA1 gene is produced to cope with cellular injuries caused by heat stress. It has been previously pointed out that several polymorphisms located at the promoter region of this gene seem to be the main responsible for the differences in the heat stress response observed among alternative genotypes in terms of gene expression rate. The present study, focused on the functional study of those candidate polymorphisms by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and in vitro luciferase expression assays, has revealed that the observed differences in the transcriptional activity of the HSP90AA1 gene as response to heat stress are caused by the presence of a cytosine insertion (rs397514115) and a C to G transversion (rs397514116) at the promoter region. Next, we discovered the presence of epigenetic marks at the promoter and along the gene body founding an allele-specific methylation of the rs397514116 mutation in DNA extrated from blood samples. This regulatory mechanism interacts synergistically to modulate gene expression depending on environmental circumstances. Taking into account the results obtained, it is suggested that the transcription of the HSP90AA1 ovine gene is regulated by a cooperative action of transcription factors (TFs) whose binding sites are polymorphic and where the influence of epigenetic events should be also taken into account.

Abstract: Multipotent human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) are the common progenitors of osteoblasts and adipocytes. A shift in hBMSC differentiation in favor of adipogenesis may contribute to the bone loss and marrow fat accumulation observed in aging and osteoporosis. Hence, the identification of factors modulating marrow adipogenesis is of great therapeutic interest. Fibroblast growth factors 1 (FGF1) and 2 (FGF2) play important roles in several cellular processes including differentiation. Their role in adipogenesis is, however, still unclear given the contradictory reports found in the literature. In this work, we investigated the effect of FGF signaling on hBMSC adipogenesis in a 3D collagen gel system to mimic the natural microenvironment. We successfully established adipogenic differentiation of hBMSC embedded in type I collagen gels. We found that exogenous FGF1 and FGF2 exerted an inhibitory effect on lipid droplet accumulation and gene expression of adipogenic markers, which was abolished by pharmacological blocking of FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling. FGF treatment also affected the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1), altering the MMP/TIMP balance, which modulates collagen processing and turnover. FGF1- and FGF2-mediated inhibition of differentiation was, however, not restricted to adipogenesis since FGF1 and FGF2 treatment also resulted in the inhibition of the osteogenic differentiation in collagen gels. We conclude that FGFR signaling inhibits the in vitro adipogenic commitment of hBMSCs, downregulating core differentiation markers and altering ECM composition.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have adopted an accelerated cell-cycle program with shortened gap phases and precocious expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). We examined the effect of CDK inhibition on the pathways regulating proliferation and survival of ESCs. We found that inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) leads to activation of the DNA damage response, nuclear p53 stabilization, activation of a subset of p53 target genes including NOXA, and negative regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 in human and mouse ESCs, but not differentiated cells. We demonstrate that MCL1 is highly expressed in ESCs and loss of MCL1 leads to ESC death. Finally, we show that clinically relevant CDK1 inhibitors prevent formation of ESC-derived tumors and induce necrosis in established ESC-derived tumors. Our data demonstrate that ES cells are uniquely sensitive to CDK1 inhibition via a p53/NOXA/MCL1 pathway.

Abstract: Changes in salinity affect the physiological status of the marine habitat including that of the intertidal mud crab Macrophthalmus japonicus. Chitinases play significant biological roles in crustaceans such as morphogenesis, nutrient digestion, and pathogen defense. In this study, the osmoregulatory function of three chitinase gene transcripts was determined compared to seawater (SW, 31 ± 1 psu) in M. japonicus gills and hepatopancreas under different salinities (10, 25, and 40 psu) for 1, 4, and 7 days. In SW-exposed crab, quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed chitinase 1 (Mj-chi1) and chitinase 4 (Mj-chi4) transcripts constitutively expressed in all the tested tissues with strong expression in hepatopancreas, but chitinase 5 (Mj-chi5) showed highest expression in stomach. When exposed to different salinities, Mj-chi1 showed significant up-regulation at day 4 whereas Mj-chi4 showed late up-regulation (day 7) at all the salinities in hepatopancreas. In the gills, early up-regulation (day 1) in Mj-chi1 and time-dependent late up-regulation (day 7) in Mj-chi4 at high salinity were observed. These results indicate the possibility of using Mj-chi4 as a marker against salinity changes. Moreover, our results further suggest that Mj-chi1 and Mj-chi4 transcriptions were significantly affected by changes in salinity; however, Mj-chi5 in gills was less affected by salinity and showed no effect in hepatopancreas. Thus, chitinase transcription modulations in the gills are more sensitive than hepatopancreas to salinity stress. Further, present data indicate the possible existence of different physiological roles among chitinase gene families, which need to be clarified in more detail by future biochemical and physiological functional studies.

Plant stilbenes induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and their anti-cancer activity can be enhanced by inhibitors of autophagy,

Abstract: Background
Environmental conditions or chemical agents can interfere with the function of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the resulting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can be toxic to the cell if it is not relieved. The classical compensatory response to ER stress is the unfolded protein response (UPR) that reduces protein load in the ER. However, autophagy may also compensate by removing large insoluble protein aggregates. Agents that stress the ER can have anti-cancer activity, and novel applications of ER stress inducing agents are being investigated. Plant stilbenes are a class of stress responsive molecules that includes resveratrol, which are being investigated as potential therapeutics in humans for conditions such as aging or cancer.
Results
We performed a screen of 1726 small, drug like molecules to identify those that could activate an ER-stress responsive luciferase gene. After secondary screening, we determined that the plant stilbenes pterostilbene and piceatannol were the most potent inducers of ER stress from this group. ER stress can be particularly toxic to cells with high ER load, so we examined their effect on cells expressing the Wnt family of secreted glycoprotein growth factors. Molecular analysis determined that these ER stress-inducing stilbenes could block Wnt processing and also induce autophagy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells expressing Wnt16. Combining pterostilbene (to induce ER stress) with chloroquine (to inhibit autophagy) lead to significant cellular toxicity in cells from aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Conclusions
Plant stilbenes are potent inducers of ER stress. However, their toxicity is more pronounced in cancer cells expressing Wnt growth factors. The toxicity of stilbenes in these ALL cells can be potentiated by the addition of autophagy inhibitors, suggesting a possible therapeutic application.

Abstract: The general view of the lysosome as the terminal end of cellular catabolic pathways, has started to change due to the recent discoveries of a lysosomal nutrient sensing machinery and of a lysosome-to-nucleus signaling mechanism that modulate lysosomal function by way of the master transcriptional regulator TFEB. Lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy are coordinated by TFEB, whose function is regulated by phosphorylation. TFEB interacts with and is phosphorylated by mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface. Thus, conditions resulting in inhibition of mTOR, such as starvation and lysosomal stress, promote TFEB nuclear translocation. Preliminary evidences showing that the TFEB activation are able to ameliorate the phenotype of lysosomal storage disorders and more common neurodegenerative diseases have opened an extraordinary possibility for the development of innovative therapies. Research in TFEB and lysosomal function has continued to advance and attract interest due to increased understanding of the mechanisms behind lysosomal function. In this paper, we present a set of procedures that facilitate examination of TFEB function and its related processes.

Abstract: S100A9 belongs to the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins and is over-expressed in many human tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent study demonstrated that S100A9 is significantly elevated and is associated with tumor differentiation and vascular invasion in HCC. The functional role of S100A9 is, however, poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that S100A9 treatment increased viability, invasiveness and clone formation in three HCC cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721 and Huh7). S100A9 also promoted tumor growth in vivo by a xenograft mouse model. In addition, we observed a co-localization of S100A9 with receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in human HCC intratumoral tissues and an interaction of S100A9 with RAGE in vitro. Treatment with RAGE blocking antibody blocked the enhanced viability, invasion, clone formation and tumor growth in vivo resulted by S100A9, suggesting that these effects were mediated via RAGE ligation. In order to investigate the signaling pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was characterized. S100A9 caused a significant increase in p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 levels, and inhibition of which blocked enhanced invasion and viability resulted by S100A9, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with RAGE blocking antibodies also abrogated the S100A9-induced p38 and ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that S100A9-induced MAPK activation is mediated via RAGE ligation. Our data demonstrate that S100A9 binds to RAGE and stimulates RAGE-dependent MAPK signaling cascades, promoting cell growth and invasion in HCC.

Abstract: Cell-surface markers and transcription factors are being used in the assessment of stem cell fate and therapeutic safety, but display significant variability in stem cell cultures. We assessed nuclear patterns of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC, associated with pluripotency), a second important epigenetic mark, and its combination with 5-methylcytosine (5mC, associated with differentiation), also in comparison to more established markers of pluripotency (Oct-4) and endodermal differentiation (FoxA2, Sox17) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) over a 10-day differentiation course in vitro: by means of confocal and super-resolution imaging together with 3D high-content analysis, an essential tool in single-cell screening. In summary: 1) We did not measure any significant correlation of putative markers with global 5mC or 5hmC. 2) While average Oct-4 levels stagnated on a cell-population base (0.015 lnIU/day), Sox17 and FoxA2 increased 22-fold and 3-fold faster, respectively (Sox17: 0.343 lnIU/day; FoxA2: 0.046 lnIU/day). In comparison, global DNA methylation levels increased 4-fold faster (0.068 lnIU/day), and global hydroxymethylation declined at 0.046 lnIU/day, both with a better explanation of the temporal profile. 3) This progression was concomitant with the occurrence of distinct nuclear codistribution patterns that represented a heterogeneous spectrum of states in differentiation; converging to three major coexisting 5mC/5hmC phenotypes by day 10: 5hmC+/5mC−, 5hmC+/5mC+, and 5hmC−/5mC+ cells. 4) Using optical nanoscopy we could delineate the respective topologies of 5mC/5hmC colocalization in subregions of nuclear DNA: in the majority of 5hmC+/5mC+ cells 5hmC and 5mC predominantly occupied mutually exclusive territories resembling euchromatic and heterochromatic regions, respectively. Simultaneously, in a smaller subset of cells we observed a tighter colocalization of the two cytosine variants, presumably delineating chromatin domains in remodeling. We conclude that 1) 5mC emerges as the most differential marker in our model system. 2) However, the combined enrollment of the two DNA modifications provided higher-definition screening and lead to the identification of cell subpopulations based on differential 5hmC/5mC phenotypes corresponding to different 5hmC/5mC ratios. The results encourage: a) assessing the regenerative potential of early-endodermal cells enriched for the three DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation categories, and b) exploring the universality of this type of epigenetic phenotyping across other lineage-specific differentiations.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in articular cartilage ultimately result in loss of joint function. Repairing cartilage defects requires cell sources. We developed an approach to generate scaffoldless hyaline cartilage from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We initially generated an hiPSC line that specifically expressed GFP in cartilage when teratoma was formed. We optimized the culture conditions and found BMP2, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and GDF5 critical for GFP expression and thus chondrogenic differentiation of the hiPSCs. The subsequent use of scaffoldless suspension culture contributed to purification, producing homogenous cartilaginous particles. Subcutaneous transplantation of the hiPSC-derived particles generated hyaline cartilage that expressed type II collagen, but not type I collagen, in immunodeficiency mice. Transplantation of the particles into joint surface defects in immunodeficiency rats and immunosuppressed mini-pigs indicated that neocartilage survived and had potential for integration into native cartilage. The immunodeficiency mice and rats suffered from neither tumors nor ectopic tissue formation. The hiPSC-derived cartilaginous particles constitute a viable cell source for regenerating cartilage defects.

Abstract: We identify and characterize 14 small heat-shock protein (sHSP) genes from the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), a destructive pest. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that, except for sHSP18.8 and sHSP19.22, the other 12 DBM sHSPs belong to five known insect sHSP groups. Developmental expression analysis revealed that most sHSPs peaked in the pupal and adult stages. The transcripts of sHSPs display tissue specificity with two exhibiting constitutive expression in four tested tissues. Expression of sHSP18.8 in fourth instar larvae is not induced by the tested abiotic stressors, and unless sHSP21.8 is not sensitive to thermal stress, 12 sHSPs are significantly up-regulated. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of all sHSPs are reduced under oxidative stress. Food deprivation leads to significant down-regulation of three sHSPs. The majority of sHSPs show expression variation to various heavy metals, whereas mRNA abundances of sHSP22.1 and sHSP 28.9 are reduced by four heavy metals. The responses of sHSPs to indoxacarb and cantharidin are varied. Beta-cypermethrin and chlorfenapyr exposure results in an increase of 13 sHSP transcripts and a reduction of 12 sHSP transcripts, respectively. These results show that different sHSPs might play distinct roles in the development and regulation of physiological activities, as well as in response to various abiotic stresses of DBM.

Abstract: Summary
The number of stem/progenitor cells available can profoundly impact tissue homeostasis and the response to injury or disease. Here, we propose that an atypical PKC, Prkci, is a key player in regulating the switch from an expansion to a differentiation/maintenance phase via regulation of Notch, thus linking the polarity pathway with the control of stem cell self-renewal. Prkci is known to influence symmetric cell division in invertebrates; however a definitive role in mammals has not yet emerged. Using a genetic approach, we find that loss of Prkci results in a marked increase in the number of various stem/progenitor cells. The mechanism used likely involves inactivation and symmetric localization of NUMB, leading to the activation of NOTCH1 and its downstream effectors. Inhibition of atypical PKCs may be useful for boosting the production of pluripotent stem cells, multipotent stem cells, or possibly even primordial germ cells by promoting the stem cell/progenitor fate.

Abstract: Background
Ephrin-B2 is the sole physiologically-relevant ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4, which is over-expressed in many epithelial cancers, including 66% of prostate cancers, and contributes to cancer cell survival, invasion and migration. Crucially, however, the cancer-promoting EphB4 signalling pathways are independent of interaction with its ligand ephrin-B2, as activation of ligand-dependent signalling causes tumour suppression. Ephrin-B2, however, is often found on the surface of endothelial cells of the tumour vasculature, where it can regulate angiogenesis to support tumour growth. Proteolytic cleavage of endothelial cell ephrin-B2 has previously been suggested as one mechanism whereby the interaction between tumour cell-expressed EphB4 and endothelial cell ephrin-B2 is regulated to support both cancer promotion and angiogenesis.
Methods
An in silico approach was used to search accessible surfaces of 3D protein models for cleavage sites for the key prostate cancer serine protease, KLK4, and this identified murine ephrin-B2 as a potential KLK4 substrate. Mouse ephrin-B2 was then confirmed as a KLK4 substrate by in vitro incubation of recombinant mouse ephrin-B2 with active recombinant human KLK4. Cleavage products were visualised by SDS-PAGE, silver staining and Western blot and confirmed by N-terminal sequencing.
Results
At low molar ratios, KLK4 cleaved murine ephrin-B2 but other prostate-specific KLK family members (KLK2 and KLK3/PSA) were less efficient, suggesting cleavage was KLK4-selective. The primary KLK4 cleavage site in murine ephrin-B2 was verified and shown to correspond to one of the in silico predicted sites between extracellular domain residues arginine 178 and asparagine 179. Surprisingly, the highly homologous human ephrin-B2 was poorly cleaved by KLK4 at these low molar ratios, likely due to the 3 amino acid differences at this primary cleavage site.
Conclusion
These data suggest that in in vivo mouse xenograft models, endogenous mouse ephrin-B2, but not human tumour ephrin-B2, may be a downstream target of cancer cell secreted human KLK4. This is a critical consideration when interpreting data from murine explants of human EphB4+/KLK4+ cancer cells, such as prostate cancer cells, where differential effects may be seen in mouse models as opposed to human clinical situations.

Abstract: Summary
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum replicates within erythrocytes, producing progeny merozoites that are released from infected cells via a poorly understood process called egress. The most abundant merozoite surface protein, MSP1, is synthesized as a large precursor that undergoes proteolytic maturation by the parasite protease SUB1 just prior to egress. The function of MSP1 and its processing are unknown. Here we show that SUB1-mediated processing of MSP1 is important for parasite viability. Processing modifies the secondary structure of MSP1 and activates its capacity to bind spectrin, a molecular scaffold protein that is the major component of the host erythrocyte cytoskeleton. Parasites expressing an inefficiently processed MSP1 mutant show delayed egress, and merozoites lacking surface-bound MSP1 display a severe egress defect. Our results indicate that interactions between SUB1-processed merozoite surface MSP1 and the spectrin network of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton facilitate host erythrocyte rupture to enable parasite egress.

Abstract: Acute stress alters anti-bacterial defenses, but the neuroimmunological mechanisms underlying this association are not yet well understood. Metallothionein (MT), a cysteine-rich protein, is a stress response protein that is induced by a variety of chemical, biological, and psychological stressors, and MT has been shown to influence immune activities. We investigated MT’s role in the management of anti-bacterial responses that occur during stress, using a C57BL/6 (B6) strain that has targeted disruptions of the Mt1 and Mt2 genes (B6-MTKO), and a B6 strain that has additional copies of Mt (B6-MTTGN). The well-characterized listeriosis model was used to examine immune mechanisms that are altered by a 1-h stress treatment (cold-restraint, CR) administered just prior to bacterial infection. Intriguingly, MT gene doses both greater and lower than that of wild-type (WT) B6 mice were associated with improved host defenses against Listeria monocytogenes (LM). This augmented protection was diminished by CR stress in the MTKO mice, but transgenic mice with additional MT copies had no CR stress-induced increase in their listerial burden. During the transition from innate to adaptive immunity, on day 3 after infection, oxidative burst and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometric methods, and cytokine transcription was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. MT gene expression and CR-stress affected the expression of IL-6 and TNFα. Additionally, these genetic and environmental modulations altered the generation of ROS responses as well as the number of apoptotic cells in livers and spleens. Although the level of MT altered the listerial response, MT expression was equally elevated by listerial infection with or without CR stress. These results indicate the ability of MT to regulate immune response mechanisms and demonstrate that increased amounts of MT can eliminate the immunosuppression induced by CR.

Abstract: Recycling endosomes recently have emerged as major regulators of cytokinesis and abscission steps of cell division. Rab11-endosomes in particular were shown to transport proteins to the mitotic ingression furrow and play a key role in establishing the abscission site. Rab11 GTPase functions by binding and activating various effector proteins, such as Rab11 family interacting proteins (FIPs). FIPs appear to be at the core of many Rab11 functions, with FIP3 playing a role in targeting of the Rab11-endosomes during mitosis. Here we summarize the newest finding regarding the roles and regulation of FIP3 and Rab11 complex, as well as describe the methods developed to analyze membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics during abscission step of cytokinesis.

Abstract: Summary
The molecules and mechanisms pertinent to the low immunogenicity of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remain poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a vital mediator in this phenomenon and directly suppresses T cell immune responses. MFG-E8 is enriched in undifferentiated ESCs but diminished in differentiated ESCs. Upregulation of MFG-E8 in ESCs increases the successful engraftment of both undifferentiated and differentiated ESCs across major histocompatibility complex barriers. MFG-E8 suppresses T cell activation/proliferation and inhibits Th1, Th2, and Th17 subpopulations while increasing regulatory T cell subsets. Neutralizing MFG-E8 substantially abrogates these effects, whereas addition of recombinant MFG-E8 to differentiated ESCs restores immunosuppression. Furthermore, we provide the evidence that MFG-E8 suppresses T cell activation and regulates T cell polarization by inhibiting PKCθ phosphorylation through the α3/5βV integrin receptor. Our findings offer an approach to facilitate transplantation acceptance.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm) is an enteropathogen requiring multiple virulence factors, including two type three secretion systems (T1 and T2). T1 triggers epithelium invasion in which the bacteria are taken up into endosomes that mature into Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCV) and trigger T2 induction upon acidification. Mechanisms controlling endosome membrane integrity or pathogen egress into the cytosol are incompletely understood. We screened for host factors affecting invasion and SCV maturation and identified a role for autophagy in sealing endosomal membranes damaged by T1 during host cell invasion. S.Tm-infected autophagy-deficient (atg5−/−) cells exhibit reduced SCV dye retention and lower T2 expression but no effects on steps preceding SCV maturation. However, in the absence of T1, autophagy is dispensable for T2 induction. These findings establish a role of autophagy at early stages of S.Tm infection and suggest that autophagy-mediated membrane repair might be generally important for invasive pathogens and endosomal membrane function.

Abstract: Primary cilia are necessary for shear stress sensing in different developing organs such as the kidneys and blood vessels. In endothelial cells (ECs), primary cilia bend in response to blood flow forces and are necessary for flow sensing as well as for the control of angiogenesis. The different parameters guiding cilia bending reflect the forces generated at the surface of the ECs and the mechanical properties of the endothelial cilia. Here, we present an approach allowing the calculation of the bending rigidity of endothelial cilia based on live imaging. The method relies on segmentation and mathematical modeling to extract the critical parameters needed for the calculation.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic application of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) requires precise control over their differentiation. However, spontaneous differentiation is prevalent, and growth factors induce multiple cell types; e.g., the mesoderm inducer BMP4 generates both mesoderm and trophoblast. Here we identify endogenous WNT signals as BMP targets that are required and sufficient for mesoderm induction, while trophoblast induction is WNT independent, enabling the exclusive differentiation toward either lineage. Furthermore, endogenous WNT signals induce loss of pluripotency in hESCs and their murine counterparts, epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). WNT inhibition obviates the need to manually remove differentiated cells to maintain cultures and improves the efficiency of directed differentiation. In EpiSCs, WNT inhibition stabilizes a pregastrula epiblast state with novel characteristics, including the ability to contribute to blastocyst chimeras. Our findings show that endogenous WNT signals function as hidden mediators of growth factor-induced differentiation and play critical roles in the self-renewal of hESCs and EpiSCs.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most frequent metabolic disorders in industrialized countries. Among other complications, T2DM patients have an increased fracture risk and delayed fracture healing. We have demonstrated that supraphysiological glucose and insulin levels inhibit primary human osteoblasts׳ maturation. We aimed at developing a more physiologically relevant in vitro model to analyze T2DM-mediated osteoblast changes. Therefore, SCP-1-immortalized pre-osteoblasts were differentiated with T2DM or control (non-obese and obese) sera. Between both control groups, no significant changes were observed. Proliferation was significantly increased (1.69-fold), while AP activity and matrix mineralization was significantly reduced in the T2DM group. Expression levels of osteogenic marker genes and transcription factors were altered, e.g. down-regulation of RUNX2 and SP-7 or up-regulation of STAT1, in the T2DM group. Active TGF-β levels were significantly increased (1.46-fold) in T2DM patients׳ sera. SCP-1 cells treated with these sera showed significantly increased TGF-β signaling (2.47-fold). Signaling inhibition effectively restored osteoblast maturation in the T2DM group. Summarizing our data, SCP-1 cells differentiated in the presence of T2DM patients׳ serum exhibit reduced osteoblast function. Thus, this model has a high physiological impact, as it can identify circulating factors in T2DM patients׳ blood that may affect bone function, e.g. TGF-β.

Abstract: Scoparone, one of the bioactive components of Artemisia capillaris Thunb, has various biological properties including immunosuppressive, hepatoprotective, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. This study aims at evaluating the anti-osteoporotic effect of scoparone and its underlying mechanism in vitro. Scoparone demonstrated potent cellular antioxidant capacity. It was also found that scoparone inhibited the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation and suppressed cathepsin K and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression via c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/p38-mediated c-Fos–nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) signaling pathway. During osteoclast differentiation, the production of general reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide anions was dose-dependently attenuated by scoparone. In addition, scoparone diminished NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression and activation via the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)–cSrc–phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k) signaling pathway and prevented the disruption of mitochondrial electron transport chain system. Furthermore, scoparone augmented the expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and catalase (CAT). The overall results indicate that the inhibitory effect of scoparone on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation is attributed to the suppressive effect on ROS and superoxide anion production by inhibiting Nox1 expression and activation and protecting the mitochondrial electron transport chain system and the scavenging effect of ROS resulting from elevated SOD1 and CAT expression.

Abstract: β-Catenin signaling plays a pivotal role in the genesis of a variety of malignant tumors, but its role in breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. Here, we examined whether deregulation of β-catenin signaling is related to the aggressive characteristics of certain types of breast cancers. Analysis of cytokine levels in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing a constitutively active form of β-catenin (CAβ-catenin) revealed a higher level of CCL5 expression. Cells transfected with CAβ-catenin or stimulated with recombinant CCL5 exhibited increased cell invasion activity and spheroid formation in vitro. Furthermore, CAβ-catenin-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells formed larger tumor masses that contained more Ki-67-positive cells and infiltrating lymphocytes than did the control cells. An inhibitor of CCR5 and a pan-CXCR neutralizing antibody dramatically reduced CAβ-catenin-promoted activities. In addition to CCL5, 6-BIO, a chemical activator of β-catenin, induced cell invasion and spheroid formation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, high levels of nuclear β-catenin accumulation were detected in breast cancer in patients with metastasis but not in those without metastasis. Nuclear β-catenin localization is related to increased CCL5 production in breast cancer. These findings suggest that β-catenin expression enhances tumor progression via chemokine production in breast cancers and that β-catenin signaling is a critical regulator of the aggressive traits of breast cancers.

Abstract: Bone marrow derived cells engraft to the uterine endometrium and contribute to endometriosis. The mechanism by which these cells are mobilized and directed to the endometrium has not been previously characterized. We demonstrate that human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) produce the chemokine CXCL12 and that bone marrow cells (BMCs) express the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4. Treatment with physiological levels of estradiol (E2) induced both CXCL12 and CXCR4 expression in hESCs and BMCs, respectively. BMCs migrated towards hESCs conditioned media; a CXCR4 antagonist blocked migration indicating that CXCL12 acting through its receptor, CXCR4, is necessary for chemoattraction of BM cells to human endometrial cells. E2 increased both CXCL12 expression in endometrial cells and CXCR4 expression in BM cells, further enhancing chemoattraction. E2 induced CXCL12/CXCR4 expression in endometrium and BM, respectively, drives migration of stem cells to the endometrium. The E2-CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway may be useful in determining treatments for endometrial disorders, and may be antagonized to block stem cell migration to endometriosis.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotency represents a cell state comprising a fine-tuned pattern of transcription factor activity required for embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. TBX3 is the earliest expressed member of the T-box transcription factor family and is involved in maintenance and induction of pluripotency. Hence, TBX3 is believed to be a key member of the pluripotency circuitry, with loss of TBX3 coinciding with loss of pluripotency. We report a dynamic expression of TBX3 in vitro and in vivo using genetic reporter tools tracking TBX3 expression in mouse ESCs (mESCs). Low TBX3 levels are associated with reduced pluripotency, resembling the more mature epiblast. Notably, TBX3-low cells maintain the intrinsic capability to switch to a TBX3-high state and vice versa. Additionally, we show TBX3 to be dispensable for induction and maintenance of naive pluripotency as well as for germ cell development. These data highlight novel facets of TBX3 action in mESCs.

Abstract: Protein gradients play key roles in subcellular spatial organization. In bacteria, ParA adenosine triphosphatases, or ATPases, form dynamic gradients on the nucleoid surface, which imparts positional information for the segregation, transport, and positioning of chromosomes, plasmids, and large protein assemblies. Despite the apparent simplicity of these minimal and self-organizing systems, the mechanism remains unclear. The small size of bacteria along with the number of physical and biochemical processes involved in subcellular organization makes it difficult to study these systems under controlled conditions in vivo. We developed a cell-free reconstitution technique that allows for the visualization of ParA-mediated cargo transport on a DNA carpet, which acts as a biomimetic of the nucleoid surface. Here, we present methods to express, purify, and visualize the dynamic properties of the SopABC system from F plasmid, considered a paradigm for the study of ParA-type systems. We hope similar cell-free studies will be used to address the biochemical and biophysical underpinnings of this ubiquitous transport scheme in bacteria.

Abstract: The in vitro antioxidant properties, cytoprotective activity, and ability to induce nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) of five solvent fractions of the methylene chloride/methanol (1:1 v/v) extract of Khaya grandifoliola (Meliaceae) and Entada africana (Fabaceae) were evaluated. Five antioxidant endpoints were used in the antioxidant activity investigation. The total phenolic content of the fractions was assessed as to the Folin–Ciocalteu method and the profile of interesting fractions analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The cytoprotective activity of fractions was determined by H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HC-04 cells by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage into culture medium. HC-04 cells were used to investigate the ability to induce nuclear translocation of Nrf2. For both plants, the methylene chloride/methanol (90/10; v/v) fraction (F10), methylene chloride/methanol (75/25; v/v) (F25), and the methanolic fraction (F100) were found to have the highest total polyphenol content and exhibited high antioxidant activity strongly correlated with total polyphenol content. The cytoprotective activity of fraction F25 from both plants was comparable to that of quercetin (3.40±0.05 μg/mL), inhibiting LDH leakage with a low half inhibition concentration (IC50) of 4.05±0.03 and 3.8±0.02 μg/mL for K. grandifoliola and E. africana, respectively. Lastly, fraction F25 of K. grandifoliola significantly (P < 0.05) induced nuclear Nrf2 translocation by sixfold, whereas that from E. africana and quercetin was only twofold. The results indicate for the first time that fraction F25 of the studied plants is more antioxidant and cytoprotective and induces nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in a human hepatocyte cell line.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a family of ATP-independent molecular chaperones which prevent cellular protein aggregation by binding to misfolded proteins. sHSPs form large oligomers that undergo drastic rearrangement/dissociation in order to execute their chaperone activity in protecting substrates from stress. Substrate-binding sites on sHSPs have been predominantly mapped on their intrinsically disordered N-terminal arms. This region is highly variable in sequence and length across species, and has been implicated in both oligomer formation and in mediating chaperone activity. Here, we present our results on the functional and structural characterization of five sHSPs in rice, each differing in their subcellular localisation, viz., cytoplasm, nucleus, chloroplast, mitochondria and peroxisome. We performed activity assays and dynamic light scattering studies to highlight differences in the chaperone activity and quaternary assembly of sHSPs targeted to various organelles. By cloning constructs that differ in the length and sequence of the tag in the N-terminal region, we have probed the sensitivity of sHSP oligomer assembly and chaperone activity to the length and amino acid composition of the N-terminus. In particular, we have shown that the incorporation of an N-terminal tag has significant consequences on sHSP quaternary structure.

Abstract: Thermal stress has a significant adverse effect on commercial swine production but it is not easy to measure. Animals may adapt to stress conditions by an alteration in the expression of stress-related genes such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). The present study presents a comparative analysis of seasonally varied effects on the expression profiles of HSPs (27, 70, and 90) and MCTs (1, 2, and 4) transcripts in thigh muscle and colon tissue of Ghungroo and Large White Yorkshire (LWY) breeds of pig. By real-time polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA expression of HSP27 and HSP90 genes was found to be higher in both thigh muscle and colon tissue in Ghungroo compared to Large White Yorkshire pigs during the summer. However, the relative expression of HSP70 was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in Ghungroo compared to Large White Yorkshire pigs during both seasons in both thigh muscle and colon tissue. The expression of HSP90 was higher in Ghungroo when compared to LWY though the variation was non-significant (P > 0.05) in the colon during different seasons. However, in Ghungroo, the mRNA expression of MCT1 was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher in thigh muscle and colon regions during the summer compared to LWY, whereas MCT2 was expressed more in the colon in LWY compared to Ghungroo during the summer. The relative expression of mRNA of MCT4 was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher in thigh region in both summer and winter in Ghungroo compared with LWY. Thus, the study demonstrated that both HSPs and MCTs gene expression during thermal stress suggests the possible involvement of these genes in reducing the deleterious effect of thermal stress, thus maintaining cellular integrity and homeostasis in pigs. These genes could be used as suitable markers for the assessment of stress in pigs.

Abstract: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) protects glycocalyx against shedding, playing important roles in endothelial functions. We previously found that glycocalyx on endothelial cells (ECs) was shed after plasma protein depletion. In the present study, we investigated the role of S1P on the recovery of glycocalyx, and tested whether it is mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. After depletion of plasma protein, ECs were treated with S1P for another 6h. And then, the major components of glycocalyx including syndecan-1 with attached heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) on endothelial cells were detected using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Role of PI3K in the S1P-induced synthesis of glycocalyx was confirmed by using the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). Syndecan-1 with attached HS and CS were degraded with duration of plasma protein depletion. S1P induced recovery of syndecan-1 with attached HS and CS. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolished the effect of S1P on recovery of glycocalyx. Thus, S1P induced synthesis of glycocalyx on endothelial cells and it is mediated by PI3K pathway.

Short-term uvb-irradiation leads to putative limbal stem cell damage and niche cell-mediated upregulation of macrophage recruiting cytokines,

Abstract: Ultraviolet light B (UVB)-irradiation is linked to various ocular pathologies such as limbal stem cell defects in pterygium. Despite the large circumstantial evidence linking UVB irradiation and limbal epithelial stem cell damage, the precise molecular responses of limbal stem cells to UVB irradiation are unclear. Here the effect of UVB irradiation on the putative stem cell phenotype, limbal niche cells and the subsequent effects on corneal (lymph)angiogenic privilege were investigated. Primary human limbal epithelial stem cells and fibroblasts were irradiated with 0.02J/cm2 of UVB, a low dose corresponding to 3min of solar irradiation. UVB irradiation caused significant reduction of limbal epithelial and limbal fibroblast proliferation for 24h, but apoptosis of limbal epithelial stem cells only. Moreover, UVB induced stem-like character loss of limbal epithelial cells, as their colony forming efficiency and putative stem cell marker expression significantly decreased. Interestingly, limbal epithelial cells co-cultured with UVB-irradiated limbal fibroblasts also exhibited loss of stem cell character and decrease of colony forming efficiency. Conditioned media from limbal epithelial cells inhibited lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation and tube network complexity; however this effect diminished following UVB irradiation. In contrast, pro-inflammatory and macrophage-recruiting cytokines such as TNFα, IFNγ and MCP1 were significantly upregulated following cell irradiation of limbal fibroblasts. These data demonstrate the key role of the limbal stem cell niche in response to UVB and subsequent (lymph)angiogenic and inflammatory events. These data suggest that the known pro(lymph)angiogenic effect of UVB irradiation in pterygium is not linked to a direct up-regulation of pro-angiogenic cytokines, but rather to indirect macrophage-recruiting cytokines being upregulated after UVB irradiation.
