Abstract: Summary
While dysfunction of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in chronic pain, the underlying neural circuits and the contribution of specific cellular populations remain unclear. Using in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we report that in both male and female mice, peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain causes a marked reduction of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneuron activity in the prelimbic area of the mPFC, which contributes to decreased prefrontal cortical outputs. Moreover, prelimbic glutamatergic projections to GABAergic interneurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are diminished, leading to loss of cortical-cortical inhibition and increased pyramidal neuron activity in the ACC. Chemogenetic activation of prelimbic VIP interneurons restores neuronal responses in the mPFC-ACC pathway and attenuates pain-like behaviors in mice. Furthermore, restoration of prelimbic outputs to the ACC reverses nerve injury-induced ACC hyperactivation. These findings reveal mPFC circuit changes associated with neuropathic pain and highlight VIP interneurons as potential therapeutic targets for pain treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Biologically active small molecules can impart modulatory effects, in some cases providing extended long-term memory. In a screen of biologically active small molecules for regulators of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induction, we identify several compounds with the ability to induce training effects on human macrophages. Rutaecarpine shows acute and long-term modulation, enhancing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and relieving LPS tolerance in human macrophages. Rutaecarpine inhibits β-glucan-induced H3K4Me3 marks at the promoters of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potential of this molecule to modulate chromosomal topology. Syk kinase inhibitor (SYKi IV), another screen hit, promotes an enhanced response to LPS similar to that previously reported for β-glucan-induced training. Macrophages trained with SYKi IV show a high degree of resistance to influenza A, multiple variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and OC43 coronavirus infection, highlighting a potential application of this molecule and other SYKis as prophylactic treatments for viral susceptibility.

Abstract: Summary
Gene-environment interactions can perturb the epigenome, triggering network alterations that participate in cancer pathogenesis. Integrating epigenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolic analyses with functional perturbation, we show that the tumor suppressor p53 preserves genomic integrity by empowering adequate levels of the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). In p53-deficient cells, perturbation of DNA methylation promotes derepression of heterochromatin, massive loss of histone H3-lysine 9 methylation, and consequent upregulation of satellite RNAs that triggers R-loop-associated replication stress and chromosomal aberrations. In p53-deficient cells, the inadequate SAM level underlies the inability to respond to perturbation because exogenous reintroduction of SAM represses satellite elements and restores the ability to cope with stress. Mechanistically, p53 transcriptionally controls genes involved in one-carbon metabolism, including Slc43a2, the methionine uptake transporter that is critical for SAM synthesis. Supported by clinical data, our findings shed light on the role of p53-mediated metabolism in preventing unscheduled R-loop-associated genomic instability.

Abstract: Summary
Copper deficiency has emerged to be associated with various lipid metabolism diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the mechanisms that dictate the association between copper deficiency and metabolic diseases remain obscure. Here, we reveal that copper restoration caused by hepatic ceruloplasmin (Cp) ablation enhances lipid catabolism by promoting the assembly of copper-load SCO1-LKB1-AMPK complex. Overnutrition-mediated Cp elevation results in hepatic copper loss, whereas Cp ablation restores copper content to the normal level without eliciting detectable hepatotoxicity and ameliorates NAFLD in mice. Mechanistically, SCO1 constitutively interacts with LKB1 even in the absence of copper, and copper-loaded SCO1 directly tethers LKB1 to AMPK, thereby activating AMPK and consequently promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, this study reveals a mechanism by which copper, as a signaling molecule, improves hepatic lipid catabolism, and it indicates that targeting copper-SCO1-AMPK signaling pathway ameliorates NAFLD development by modulating AMPK activity.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal activity induces topoisomerase IIβ (Top2B) to generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the promoters of neuronal early response genes (ERGs) and facilitate their transcription, and yet, the mechanisms that control Top2B-mediated DSB formation are unknown. Here, we report that stimulus-dependent calcium influx through NMDA receptors activates the phosphatase calcineurin to dephosphorylate Top2B at residues S1509 and S1511, which stimulates its DNA cleavage activity and induces it to form DSBs. Exposing mice to a fear conditioning paradigm also triggers Top2B dephosphorylation at S1509 and S1511 in the hippocampus, indicating that calcineurin also regulates Top2B-mediated DSB formation following physiological neuronal activity. Furthermore, calcineurin-Top2B interactions following neuronal activity and sites that incur activity-induced DSBs are preferentially localized at the nuclear periphery in neurons. Together, these results reveal how radial gene positioning and the compartmentalization of activity-dependent signaling govern the position and timing of activity-induced DSBs and regulate gene expression patterns in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Remembering the location of a food or water source is essential for survival. Here, we reveal that spatial memory for food location is reflected in ventral hippocampus (HPCv) neuron activity and is impaired by HPCv lesion. HPCv mediation of foraging-related memory involves communication to the lateral septum (LS), as either reversible or chronic disconnection of HPCv-to-LS signaling impairs spatial memory retention for food or water location. This neural pathway selectively encodes appetitive spatial memory, as HPCv-LS disconnection does not affect spatial memory for escape location in a negative reinforcement procedure, food intake, or social and olfactory-based appetitive learning. Neural pathway tracing and functional mapping analyses reveal that LS neurons recruited during the appetitive spatial memory procedure are primarily GABAergic neurons that project to the lateral hypothalamus. Collective results emphasize that the neural substrates controlling spatial memory are outcome specific based on reinforcer modality.

Abstract: Summary
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a hub for cognitive control, and dopamine profoundly influences its functions. In other brain regions, astrocytes sense diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and, in turn, orchestrate regulation of neuroactive substances. However, basic physiology of PFC astrocytes, including which neuromodulatory signals they respond to and how they contribute to PFC function, is unclear. Here, we characterize divergent signaling signatures in mouse astrocytes of the PFC and primary sensory cortex, which show differential responsiveness to locomotion. We find that PFC astrocytes express receptors for dopamine but are unresponsive through the Gs/Gi-cAMP pathway. Instead, fast calcium signals in PFC astrocytes are time locked to dopamine release and are mediated by α1-adrenergic receptors both ex vivo and in vivo. Further, we describe dopamine-triggered regulation of extracellular ATP at PFC astrocyte territories. Thus, we identify astrocytes as active players in dopaminergic signaling in the PFC, contributing to PFC function though neuromodulator receptor crosstalk.

Abstract: Senescence is associated with a decline in physiological function, which is accompanied by onset of diseases. Growth hormone (GH) is a class of growth-promoting cytokines with reduced secretion in aging populations. However, the effect of senescence on GH bioactivity is not fully understood in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). In this work, GH-induced cellular behavior and intracellular signaling transduction were explored in senescent hMSCs. Therefore, hMSCs were used to establish a senescence model by H2O2 treatment for this study. First, we investigated the effects of cellular senescence on the cell behavior of GH. The experimental results suggested that GH could not be internalized into the nucleus, and a significant reduction in GH internalization into the cytoplasm was observed in senescent hMSCs compared to the control group. Second, the effect of cellular senescence on GH-mediated intracellular signaling pathways was investigated by Western blotting. For this, the signaling molecule activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator transcription (STAT) stimulated by GH was detected. Our data indicated that the signaling intensity of p-JAK2, p-STAT5, p-STAT3 and p-STAT1 was considerably weakened. Taken together, these findings provide important insights into the impaired effects of cellular senescence on the biological activity of GH.

Abstract: Summary
Mast cells (MCs) are granulated cells implicated in inflammatory disorders because of their capacity to degranulate, releasing prestored proinflammatory mediators. As MCs have the unique capacity to reform granules following degranulation in vitro, their potential to regranulate in vivo is linked to their pathogenesis. It is not known what factors regulate regranulation, let alone if regranulation occurs in vivo. We report that mice can undergo multiple bouts of MC regranulation following successive anaphylactic reactions. mTORC1, a nutrient sensor that activates protein and lipid synthesis, is necessary for regranulation. mTORC1 activity is regulated by a glucose-6-phosphate transporter, Slc37a2, which increases intracellular glucose-6-phosphate and ATP during regranulation, two upstream signals of mTOR. Additionally, Slc37a2 concentrates extracellular metabolites within endosomes, which are trafficked into nascent granules. Thus, the metabolic switch associated with MC regranulation is mediated by the interactions of a cellular metabolic sensor and a transporter of extracellular metabolites into MC granules.

Abstract: Summary
Low dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) availability in the striatum can predispose for cocaine abuse; though how low striatal D2Rs facilitate cocaine reward is unclear. Overexpression of D2Rs in striatal neurons or activation of D2Rs by acute cocaine suppresses striatal Penk mRNA. Conversely, low D2Rs in D2-striatal neurons increases striatal Penk mRNA and enkephalin peptide tone, an endogenous mu-opioid agonist. In brain slices, met-enkephalin and inhibition of enkephalin catabolism suppresses intra-striatal GABA transmission. Pairing cocaine with intra-accumbens met-enkephalin during place conditioning facilitates acquisition of preference, while mu-opioid receptor antagonist blocks preference in wild-type mice. We propose that heightened striatal enkephalin potentiates cocaine reward by suppressing intra-striatal GABA to enhance striatal output. Surprisingly, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist does not block cocaine preference in mice with low striatal D2Rs, implicating other opioid receptors. The bidirectional regulation of enkephalin by D2R activity and cocaine offers insights into mechanisms underlying the vulnerability for cocaine abuse.

Abstract: Summary
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-invasive stage of breast cancer. During invasion, the encapsulating DCIS basement membrane (BM) is compromised, and tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma. The mechanisms that regulate functional epithelial BMs in vivo are poorly understood. Myosin-X (MYO10) is a filopodia-inducing protein associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome in invasive breast cancer (IBC). We identify elevated MYO10 expression in human DCIS and IBC, and this suggests links with disease progression. MYO10 promotes filopodia formation and cell invasion in vitro and cancer-cell dissemination from progressively invasive human DCIS xenografts. However, MYO10-depleted xenografts are more invasive. These lesions exhibit compromised BMs, poorly defined borders, and increased cancer-cell dispersal and EMT-marker-positive cells. In addition, cancer spheroids are dependent on MYO10-filopodia to generate a near-continuous extracellular matrix boundary. Thus, MYO10 is protective in early-stage breast cancer, correlating with tumor-limiting BMs, and pro-invasive at later stages, facilitating cancer-cell dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
To infer potential causal relationships between 3D chromatin structure, enhancers, and gene transcription, we mapped each feature in a genome-wide fashion across eight narrowly spaced time points of macrophage activation. Enhancers and genes connected by loops exhibit stronger correlations between histone H3K27 acetylation and expression than can be explained by genomic distance or physical proximity alone. At these looped enhancer-promoter pairs, changes in acetylation at distal enhancers precede changes in gene expression. Changes in gene expression exhibit a directional bias at differential loop anchors; gained loops are associated with increased expression of genes oriented away from the center of the loop, and lost loops are often accompanied by high levels of transcription within the loop boundaries themselves. These results are consistent with a reciprocal relationship where loops can facilitate increased transcription by connecting promoters to distal enhancers, whereas high levels of transcription can impede loop formation.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is poorly responsive to therapy and invariably lethal. One conceivable strategy to circumvent this intractability is to co-target distinctive mechanistic components of the disease, aiming to concomitantly disrupt multiple capabilities required for tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. We assessed this concept by combining vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors that remodel the tumor vasculature with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, which enhances autophagy in GBM cancer cells and unexpectedly reprograms immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages via inhibition of histamine receptor signaling to become immunostimulatory. While neither drug is efficacious as monotherapy, the combination of imipramine with VEGF pathway inhibitors orchestrates the infiltration and activation of CD8 and CD4 T cells, producing significant therapeutic benefit in several GBM mouse models. Inclusion up front of immune-checkpoint blockade with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in eventually relapsing tumors markedly extends survival benefit. The results illustrate the potential of mechanism-guided therapeutic co-targeting of disparate biological vulnerabilities in the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Background
Previous observations illustrated that programmed cell death ligand 1 in exosomes (Exo-PD-L1) may lead to immunosuppression. This study proposed to investigate the significance of Exo-PD-L1 and the results of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.
Methods
29 lung cancer patients were enrolled. Exosomes were extracted from the blood of patients and purified, and the extracts were identified by Western blot and transmission electron microscope. Next, the levels of Exo-PD-L1 and PD-L1 in tumor tissue were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IHC, respectively. The correlation between Exo-PD-L1, IHC PD-L1 status and pathological features of patients was analyzed by applying Chi-square test. After immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, the objective response rate (ORR) was calculated, and drug response prediction in lung cancer patients by using Exo-PD-L1 alone, IHC PD-L1 alone, and their combined detection were analyzed.
Results
This study confirmed that lung cancer patients had much expression of PD-L1 in blood exosomes and that Exo-PD-L1 level was associated with IHC PD-L1 status. The expression level of Exo-PD-L1 was evidently related to the positive lymph node metastasis of lung cancer patients, while IHC PD-L1 status was not correlated with clinicopathological features of patients. Moreover, Exo-PD-L1 and IHC PD-L1 alone or their combined detection could be utilized to predict the efficacy of ICI therapy in lung cancer patients.
Conclusion
The correlation between Exo-PD-L1 and IHC PD-L1 status was indicated, and Exo-PD-L1 could assist in determining the suitable lung cancer patients suitable for ICI therapy using IHC PD-L1. This study provides references for the application of Exo-PD-L1 as an effective predictor of ICI therapy.

Abstract: This study aimed to determine the expression and investigate the role of chemokine 26 (CCL26) in colon cancer cells. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis, qRT-PCR, and western blotting were used to detect CCL26 expression while the Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to analyze the survival of patients with colon cancer. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays were performed to measure the viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used to analyze the signaling pathways regulated by CCL26. Western blotting, used to measure protein expression in this study, found overexpression of CCL26 in colon tumors. Low CCL26 levels were associated with better survival of patients as CCL26 siRNAs markedly reduced viability and proliferation, accelerated apoptosis, decreased migration and invasion, enhanced E-cadherin expression, and reduced N-cadherin and vimentin expression in cancer cells. The opposite results were obtained in CCL26-overexpressed colon cancer cells. In addition, CCL26 activated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. CCL26 siRNAs suppressed the expression of tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), and fibromodulin (FMOD), while CCL26 overexpression significantly increased the expression of all. EMT inhibition using the EMT inhibitor C19 eliminated the effect of CCL26 overexpression on colon cancer cells. In summary, CCL26 is involved in colon cancer progression through regulation of the EMT signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Disruption of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in an intron of the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, but the mechanism by which the HRE disrupts NCT is incompletely understood. We find that expression of GGGGCC repeats in Drosophila neurons induces proteasome-mediated degradation of select nucleoporins of the NPC. This process requires the Vps4 ATPase and the endosomal-sorting complex required for transport complex-III (ESCRT-III), as knockdown of ESCRT-III/Vps4 genes rescues nucleoporin levels, normalizes NCT, and suppresses GGGGCC-mediated neurodegeneration. GGGGCC expression upregulates nuclear ESCRT-III/Vps4 expression, and expansion microscopy demonstrates that the nucleoporins are translocated into the cytoplasm before undergoing proteasome-mediated degradation. These findings demonstrate a mechanism for nucleoporin degradation and NPC dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
Periodontal disease (PD) is one of the most common inflammatory diseases in humans and is initiated by an oral microbial dysbiosis that stimulates inflammation and bone loss. Here, we report an abnormal elevation of succinate in the subgingival plaque of subjects with severe PD. Succinate activates succinate receptor-1 (SUCNR1) and stimulates inflammation. We detected SUCNR1 expression in the human and mouse periodontium and hypothesize that succinate activates SUCNR1 to accelerate periodontitis through the inflammatory response. Administration of exogenous succinate enhanced periodontal disease, whereas SUCNR1 knockout mice were protected from inflammation, oral dysbiosis, and subsequent periodontal bone loss in two different models of periodontitis. Therapeutic studies demonstrated that a SUCNR1 antagonist inhibited inflammatory events and osteoclastogenesis in vitro and reduced periodontal bone loss in vivo.

Abstract: Splicing factor B subunit 4 (SF3B4), a component of the U2-pre-mRNA spliceosomal complex, contributes to tumorigenesis in several types of tumors. However, the oncogenic potential of SF3B4 in lung cancer has not yet been determined. The in vivo expression profiles of SF3B4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from publicly available data revealed a significant increase in SF3B4 expression in tumor tissues compared to that in normal tissues. The impact of SF3B4 deletion on the growth of NSCLC cells was determined using a siRNA strategy in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. SF3B4 silencing resulted in marked retardation of the A549 cell proliferation, accompanied by the accumulation of cells at the G0/G1 phase and increased expression of p27, p21, and p53. Double knockdown of SF3B4 and p53 resulted in the restoration of p21 expression and partial recovery of cell proliferation, indicating that the p53/p21 axis is involved, at least in part, in the SF3B4-mediated regulation of A549 cell proliferation. We also provided ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B) is essential for p53 accumulation after SF3B4 depletion based on followings. First, co-immunoprecipitation showed that SF3B4 interacts with UBE4B. Furthermore, UBE4B levels were decreased by SF3B4 depletion. UBE4B depletion, in turn, reproduced the outcome of SF3B4 depletion, including reduction of polyubiquitinated p53 levels, subsequent induction of p53/p21 and p27, and proliferation retardation. Collectively, our findings indicate the important role of SF3B4 in the regulation of A549 cell proliferation through the UBE4B/p53/p21 axis and p27, implicating the therapeutic strategies for NSCLC targeting SF3B4 and UBE4B.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient myelination supports nerve conduction and axonal health throughout life. In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes (OLs) carry out this demanding anabolic duty in part through biosynthetic pathways controlled by mTOR. We identify Ral GTPases as critical regulators of mouse spinal cord myelination and myelin maintenance. Ablation of Ral GTPases (RalA, RalB) in OL-lineage cells impairs timely onset and radial growth of developmental myelination, accompanied by increased endosomal/lysosomal abundance. Further examinations, including transcriptomic analyses of Ral-deficient OLs, were consistent with mTORC1-related deficits. However, deletion of the mTOR signaling-repressor Pten in Ral-deficient OL-lineage cells is unable to rescue mTORC1 activation or developmental myelination deficiencies. Induced deletion of Ral GTPases in OLs of adult mice results in late-onset myelination defects and tissue degeneration. Together, our data indicate critical roles for Ral GTPases to promote developmental spinal cord myelination, to ensure accurate mTORC1 signaling, and to protect the healthy state of myelin-axon units over time.

Abstract: Summary
Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization maps help dissect cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs. Furthermore, 3D chromatin maps contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases by connecting distal regulatory regions and genetic risk variants to their respective target genes. To understand the cell-type-specific regulatory architecture of diabetes risk, we generated transcriptomic and 3D epigenomic profiles of human pancreatic acinar, alpha, and beta cells using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq, and high-resolution Hi-C of sorted cells. Comparisons of these profiles revealed differential A/B (open/closed) chromatin compartmentalization, chromatin looping, and transcriptional factor-mediated control of cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs. We identified a total of 4,750 putative causal-variant-to-target-gene pairs at 194 type 2 diabetes GWAS signals using pancreatic 3D chromatin maps. We found that the connections between candidate causal variants and their putative target effector genes are cell-type stratified and emphasize previously underappreciated roles for alpha and acinar cells in diabetes pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Transdifferentiation, or direct cell reprogramming, is the conversion of one fully differentiated cell type into another. Whether core mechanisms are shared between natural transdifferentiation events when occurring with or without cell division is unclear. We have previously characterized the Y-to-PDA natural transdifferentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans, which occurs without cell division and requires orthologs of vertebrate reprogramming factors. Here, we identify a rectal-to-GABAergic transdifferentiation and show that cell division is required but not sufficient for conversion. We find shared mechanisms, including erasure of the initial identity, which requires the conserved reprogramming factors SEM-4/SALL, SOX-2, CEH-6/OCT, and EGL-5/HOX. We also find three additional and parallel roles of the Wnt signaling pathway: selection of a specific daughter, removal of the initial identity, and imposition of the precise final subtype identity. Our results support a model in which levels and antagonistic activities of SOX-2 and Wnt signaling provide a timer for the acquisition of final identity.

Abstract: Summary
In bacteria, AAA+ proteases such as Lon and ClpXP degrade substrates with exquisite specificity. These machines capture the energy of ATP hydrolysis to power unfolding and degradation of target substrates. Here, we show that a mutation in the ATP binding site of ClpX shifts protease specificity to promote degradation of normally Lon-restricted substrates. However, this ClpX mutant is worse at degrading ClpXP targets, suggesting an optimal balance in substrate preference for a given protease that is easy to alter. In vitro, wild-type ClpXP also degrades Lon-restricted substrates more readily when ATP levels are reduced, similar to the shifted specificity of mutant ClpXP, which has altered ATP hydrolysis kinetics. Based on these results, we suggest that the rates of ATP hydrolysis not only power substrate unfolding and degradation, but also tune protease specificity. We consider various models for this effect based on emerging structures of AAA+ machines showing conformationally distinct states.

Abstract: Summary
Pharmacologic activation of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism is protective in models of heart failure (HF). How protection occurs remains unclear, although a causative block in cardiac BCAA oxidation is widely assumed. Here, we use in vivo isotope infusions to show that cardiac BCAA oxidation in fact increases, rather than decreases, in HF. Moreover, cardiac-specific activation of BCAA oxidation does not protect from HF even though systemic activation does. Lowering plasma and cardiac BCAAs also fails to confer significant protection, suggesting alternative mechanisms of protection. Surprisingly, activation of BCAA catabolism lowers blood pressure (BP), a known cardioprotective mechanism. BP lowering occurred independently of nitric oxide and reflected vascular resistance to adrenergic constriction. Mendelian randomization studies revealed that elevated plasma BCAAs portend higher BP in humans. Together, these data indicate that BCAA oxidation lowers vascular resistance, perhaps in part explaining cardioprotection in HF that is not mediated directly in cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play important roles in regulating tissue homeostasis and innate immune responses. Generation of ILCs after engraftment of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived hematopoietic progenitors (iHPCs) has not yet been reported. Here, we document that ILCs exist in Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− recipients engrafted with PSC-derived iHPCs guided by Runx1 and Hoxa9 expression. Upon transplantation, iHPCs immediately give rise to ILC-related progenitors containing common helper ILC progenitors in the bone marrow, followed by a more restricted population named ILC progenitors, which are able to further differentiate into mature ILCs in the primary and secondary immunodeficient recipients. The PSC-derived ILCs exhibit multiple tissue distributions and normal immunological functions. Single-cell transcriptomics illustrates the developmental trajectory of PSC-derived ILCs in vivo, which is consistent with that of natural ILCs. Our study provides insights into the generation of ILCs in animals transplanted with PSC-derived iHPCs as a cell source.

Abstract: Summary
An appropriate balance between explorative and defensive behavior is essential for the survival and reproduction of prey animals in risky environments. However, the neural circuit and mechanism that allow for such a balance remains poorly understood. Here, we use a semi-naturalistic predator threat test (PTT) to observe and quantify the defense-exploration balance, especially risk exploration behavior in mice. During the PTT, the activity of the putative dorsal CA3 glutamatergic neurons (dCA3Glu) is suppressed by predatory threat and risk exploration, whereas the neurons are activated during contextual exploration. Moreover, optogenetic excitation of these neurons induces a significant increase in risk exploration. A circuit, comprising the dorsal CA3, dorsal lateral septal, and dorsomedial hypothalamic (dCA3Glu-dLSGABA-DMH) areas, may be involved. Moreover, activation of the dCA3Glu-dLSGABA-DMH circuit promotes the switch from defense to risk exploration and suppresses threat-induced increase in arousal.

Abstract: Summary
Heart disease is associated with re-expression of key transcription factors normally active only during prenatal development of the heart. However, the impact of this reactivation on the regulatory landscape in heart disease is unclear. Here, we use RNA-seq and ChIP-seq targeting a histone modification associated with active transcriptional enhancers to generate genome-wide enhancer maps from left ventricle tissue from up to 26 healthy controls, 18 individuals with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and five fetal hearts. Healthy individuals have a highly reproducible epigenomic landscape, consisting of more than 33,000 predicted heart enhancers. In contrast, we observe reproducible disease-associated changes in activity at 6,850 predicted heart enhancers. Combined analysis of adult and fetal samples reveals that the heart disease epigenome and transcriptome both acquire fetal-like characteristics, with 3,400 individual enhancers sharing fetal regulatory properties. We also provide a comprehensive data resource (http://heart.lbl.gov) for the mechanistic exploration of DCM etiology.

Abstract: Summary
The pyrin inflammasome acts as a guard of RhoA GTPases and is central to immune defenses against RhoA-manipulating pathogens. Pyrin activation proceeds in two steps. Yet, the second step is still poorly understood. Using cells constitutively activated for the pyrin step 1, a chemical screen identifies etiocholanolone and pregnanolone, two catabolites of testosterone and progesterone, acting at low concentrations as specific step 2 activators. High concentrations of these metabolites fully and rapidly activate pyrin, in a human specific, B30.2 domain-dependent manner and without inhibiting RhoA. Mutations in MEFV, encoding pyrin, cause two distinct autoinflammatory diseases pyrin-associated autoinflammation with neutrophilic dermatosis (PAAND) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Monocytes from PAAND patients, and to a lower extent from FMF patients, display increased responses to these metabolites. This study identifies an unconventional pyrin activation mechanism, indicates that endogenous steroid catabolites can drive autoinflammation, through the pyrin inflammasome, and explains the "steroid fever" described in the late 1950s upon steroid injection in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Planar cell polarity (PCP) regulates the orientation of external structures. A core group of proteins that includes Frizzled forms the heart of the PCP regulatory system. Other PCP mechanisms that are independent of the core group likely exist, but their underlying mechanisms are elusive. Here, we show that tissue flow is a mechanism governing core group-independent PCP on the Drosophila notum. Loss of core group function only slightly affects bristle orientation in the adult central notum. This near-normal PCP results from tissue flow-mediated rescue of random bristle orientation during the pupal stage. Manipulation studies suggest that tissue flow can orient bristles in the opposite direction to the flow. This process is independent of the core group and implies that the apical extracellular matrix functions like a “comb” to align bristles. Our results reveal the significance of cooperation between tissue dynamics and extracellular substances in PCP establishment.

Abstract: The bacterial cell wall is composed of a thick layer of peptidoglycan and cell wall polymers, which are either embedded in the membrane or linked to the peptidoglycan backbone and referred to as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and wall teichoic acid (WTA), respectively. Modifications of the peptidoglycan or WTA backbone can alter the susceptibility of the bacterial cell towards cationic antimicrobials and lysozyme. The human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is intrinsically resistant towards lysozyme, mainly due to deacetylation and O-acetylation of the peptidoglycan backbone via PgdA and OatA. Recent studies identified additional factors, which contribute to the lysozyme resistance of this pathogen. One of these is the predicted ABC transporter, EslABC. An eslB mutant is hyper-sensitive towards lysozyme, likely due to the production of thinner and less O-acetylated peptidoglycan. Using a suppressor screen, we show here that suppression of eslB phenotypes could be achieved by enhancing peptidoglycan biosynthesis, reducing peptidoglycan hydrolysis or alterations in WTA biosynthesis and modification. The lack of EslB also leads to a higher negative surface charge, which likely stimulates the activity of peptidoglycan hydrolases and lysozyme. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the portion of cell surface exposed WTA is increased in the eslB mutant due to the thinner peptidoglycan layer and that latter one could be caused by an impairment in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) production or distribution.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are dynamic organelles essential for cell survival whose structural and functional integrity rely on selective and regulated transport of lipids from/to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and across the mitochondrial intermembrane space. As they are not connected by vesicular transport, the exchange of lipids between ER and mitochondria occurs at membrane contact sites. However, the mechanisms and proteins involved in these processes are only beginning to emerge. Here, we show that the main physiological localization of the lipid transfer proteins ORP5 and ORP8 is at mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) subdomains, physically linked to the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB)/mitochondrial contact sites and cristae junction organizing system (MICOS) complexes that bridge the two mitochondrial membranes. We also show that ORP5/ORP8 mediate non-vesicular transport of phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids from the ER to mitochondria by cooperating with the MIB/MICOS complexes. Overall our study reveals a physical and functional link between ER-mitochondria contacts involved in lipid transfer and intra-mitochondrial membrane contacts maintained by the MIB/MICOS complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial communities execute metabolic pathways to drive global nutrient cycles. Within a community, functionally specialized strains can perform different yet complementary steps within a linear pathway, a phenomenon termed metabolic division of labor (MDOL). However, little is known about how such metabolic behaviors shape microbial communities. Here, we derive a theoretical framework to define the assembly of a community that degrades an organic compound through MDOL. The framework indicates that to ensure community stability, the strains performing the initial steps should hold a growth advantage (m) over the “private benefit” (n) of the strain performing the last step. The steady-state frequency of the last strain is then determined by the quotient of n and m. Our experiments show that the framework accurately predicts the assembly of our synthetic consortia that degrade naphthalene through MDOL. Our results provide insights for designing and managing stable microbial systems for metabolic pathway optimization.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on diverse ancestry groups are lacking, resulting in deficits of genetic discoveries and polygenic scores. We conducted GWAS for 76 phenotypes in Korean biobank data, namely the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) (n = 72,298). Our analysis discovered 2,242 associated loci, including 122 novel associations, many of which were replicated in Biobank Japan (BBJ) GWAS. We also applied several up-to-date methods for genetic association tests to increase the power, discovering additional associations that are not identified in simple case-control GWAS. We evaluated genetic pleiotropy to investigate genes associated with multiple traits. Following meta-analysis of 32 phenotypes between KoGES and BBJ, we further identified 379 novel associations and demonstrated the improved predictive performance of polygenic risk scores by using the meta-analysis results. The summary statistics of 76 KoGES GWAS phenotypes are publicly available, contributing to a better comprehension of the genetic architecture of the East Asian population.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that are involved in controlling tumors or microbial infections through the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) inhibits IFN-γ secretion by NK cells, but the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Here, by comparing the multi-omics profiles of human NK cells before and after in vivo G-CSF treatment, we identify a pathway that is activated in response to G-CSF treatment, which suppresses IFN-γ secretion in NK cells. Specifically, glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) activated by G-CSF inhibit secretion of IFN-γ by promoting interactions between SOCS1 promoters and enhancers, as well as increasing the expression of SOCS1. Experiments in mice confirm that G-CSF treatment significantly downregulates IFN-γ secretion and upregulates GR and SOCS1 expression in NK cells. In addition, GR blockade by the antagonist RU486 significantly reverses the effects of G-CSF, demonstrating that GRs upregulate SOCS1 and inhibit the production of IFN-γ by NK cells.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are presented as early as the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. However, it remains unclear whether separate neuronal populations encode distinct aspects of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and drive them differently. Here, we report that pyramidal tract (PT) neurons projecting to the thalamus, but not to the pons or medulla, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the mouse model of AD show increased excitability, which is associated with increased irritability and aggressivity. Decreased Kv6.3 in corticothalamic PT neurons contributes to hyper-excitability, which is tightly associated with aggressive behaviors. Overexpression of Kv6.3 not only prevents abnormal excitability of corticothalamic PT neurons in mPFC, but also rescues aggressive behaviors of 3xTg model mice. Our study provides causal evidence for the contribution of corticothalamic PT neurons to irritability in the 3xTg model of AD and reveals circuit mechanisms used by PT neurons to regulate neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD.

Abstract: Background
Low shear stress (LSS) is closely related to vascular endothelial inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis. Berberine (BBR), a natural compound isolated from Coptis chinensis, has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic effects. However, the role of berberine in low shear stress-induced endothelial inflammation remains unclear.
Methods
The role of berberine in low shear stress-induced vascular endothelial inflammation was investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using a plate flow chamber in vitro and in mice with an established LSS model by partial ligation of the carotid artery in vivo.
Results
First, in vitro experiments demonstrated that BBR significantly decreased the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and the phosphorylation of Akt in HUVECs induced by low shear stress. Moreover, BBR significantly inhibited the low shear stress-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3 and its translocation to the nucleus. Notably, Akt overexpression markedly reversed the inhibitory effects of BBR on LSS-induced IRF3 activation and ICAM-1 expression. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed that BBR markedly decreased intimal ICAM-1 and IRF3 in the LSS areas of partially ligated carotid arteries in mice; however, EC-specific Akt overexpression mediated by adeno-associated viruses abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of BBR.
Conclusion
Taken together, our findings suggest that BBR treatment attenuates LSS-induced vascular endothelial inflammation by decreasing the activation of the Akt/IRF3 signalling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
How glucose metabolism remodels pro-tumor functions of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) needs further investigation. Here we show that M2-like TAMs bear the highest individual capacity to take up intratumoral glucose. Their increased glucose uptake fuels hexosamine biosynthetic pathway-dependent O-GlcNAcylation to promote cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. Glucose metabolism promotes O-GlcNAcylation of the lysosome-encapsulated protease Cathepsin B at serine 210, mediated by lysosome-localized O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), elevating mature Cathepsin B in macrophages and its secretion in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Loss of OGT in macrophages reduces O-GlcNAcylation and mature Cathepsin B in the TME and disrupts cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. Human TAMs with high OGT are positively correlated with Cathepsin B expression, and both levels predict chemotherapy response and prognosis of individuals with cancer. Our study reports the biological and potential clinical significance of glucose metabolism in tumor-promoting TAMs and reveals insights into the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
In the type III-E CRISPR-Cas system, a Cas effector (gRAMP) is associated with a TPR-CHAT to form Craspase (CRISPR-guided caspase). However, both the structural features of gRAMP and the immunity mechanism remain unknown for this system. Here, we report structures of gRAMP-crRNA and gRAMP:cRNA:target RNA as well as structures of Craspase and Craspase complexed with cognate target RNA (CTR) or non-cognate target RNA (NTR). Importantly, the 3′ anti-tag region of NTR and CTR binds at two distinct channels in Craspase, and CTR with a non-complementary 3′ anti-tag induces a marked conformational change of the TPR-CHAT, which allosterically activates its protease activity to cleave an ancillary protein Csx30. This cleavage then triggers an abortive infection as the antiviral strategy of the type III-E system. Together, our study provides crucial insights into both the catalytic mechanism of the gRAMP and the immunity mechanism of the type III-E system.

Abstract: Summary
Quorum sensing fundamentally alters the interaction of Vibrio cholerae with aquatic environments, environmental hosts, and the human intestine. At high cell density, the quorum-sensing regulator HapR represses not only expression of cholera toxin and the toxin co-regulated pilus, virulence factors essential in human infection, but also synthesis of the Vibrio polysaccharide (VPS) exopolysaccharide-based matrix required for abiotic and biotic surface attachment. Here, we describe a feature of V. cholerae quorum sensing that shifts the host-pathogen interaction toward commensalism. By repressing pathogen consumptive anabolic metabolism and, in particular, tryptophan uptake, V. cholerae HapR stimulates host intestinal serotonin production. This, in turn, activates host intestinal innate immune signaling to promote host survival.

Abstract: The onset of connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) is generally insidious and progressive, with pulmonary fibrosis in the middle stage, and eventually respiratory failure and death. This study aimed to explore the role of scorpion venom polypeptide (SVP), the primary active constituent of the entire scorpion, in alveolar macrophages and pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis mouse models were established, and then SVP and JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) was used to treat models. Alveolar macrophages were isolated and the impacts of SVP on M1/M2 polarization and the JAK/STAT6 pathway in vitro were assessed. H&E and Masson staining revealed that SVP and tofacitinib treatment alleviated lung damage and fibrosis. They also hindered the M2-polarization of macrophages in lung tissue and declined cytokine levels associated with M2 polarization (IL-4, IL-13) and fibrosis drivers (TGF-β, VEGF) in mice. Consistent with the trend presented by tofacitinib treatment, SVP suppressed the phosphorylation of proteins in the JAK/STAT6 pathway. In addition, the in vitro treatment of SVP on the isolated macrophages represented consistent results with in vivo experiments. The findings of the present study indicated that SVP suppressed the JAK/STAT6 signaling pathway, hindered alveolar macrophage M2-type polarization, and possessed the potential to ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) execute important physiological functions in numerous vital organ systems, including the vascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts. SMC differ morphologically and functionally at these different anatomical locations, but the molecular underpinnings of the differences remain poorly understood. Here, using deep single-cell RNA sequencing combined with in situ gene and protein expression analysis in four murine organs—heart, aorta, lung, and colon—we identify a molecular basis for high-level differences among vascular, visceral, and airway SMC, as well as more subtle differences between, for example, SMC in elastic and muscular arteries and zonation of elastic artery SMC along the direction of blood flow. Arterial SMC exhibit extensive organotypic heterogeneity, whereas venous SMC are similar across organs. We further identify a specific SMC subtype within the pulmonary vasculature. This comparative SMC cross-organ resource offers insight into SMC subtypes and their specific functions.

Abstract: Summary
Upon the initiation of collective cell migration, the cells at the free edge are specified as leader cells; however, the mechanism underlying the leader cell specification remains elusive. Here, we show that lamellipodial extension after the release from mechanical confinement causes sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and underlies the leader cell specification. Live-imaging of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and mouse epidermis through the use of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors showed that leader cells exhibit sustained ERK activation in a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent manner. Meanwhile, follower cells exhibit oscillatory ERK activation waves in an epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling-dependent manner. Lamellipodial extension at the free edge increases the cellular sensitivity to HGF. The HGF-dependent ERK activation, in turn, promotes lamellipodial extension, thereby forming a positive feedback loop between cell extension and ERK activation and specifying the cells at the free edge as the leader cells. Our findings show that the integration of physical and biochemical cues underlies the leader cell specification during collective cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) occur frequently in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, an aggressive sarcoma that arises from NF1-deficient Schwann cells. To define the oncogenic mechanisms underlying PRC2 loss, we use engineered cells that dynamically reassemble a competent PRC2 coupled with single-cell sequencing from clinical samples. We discover a two-pronged oncogenic process: first, PRC2 loss leads to remodeling of the bivalent chromatin and enhancer landscape, causing the upregulation of developmentally regulated transcription factors that enforce a transcriptional circuit serving as the cell’s core vulnerability. Second, PRC2 loss reduces type I interferon signaling and antigen presentation as downstream consequences of hyperactivated Ras and its cross talk with STAT/IRF transcription factors. Mapping of the transcriptional program of these PRC2-deficient tumor cells onto a constructed developmental trajectory of normal Schwann cells reveals that changes induced by PRC2 loss enforce a cellular profile characteristic of a primitive mesenchymal neural crest stem cell.

Abstract: Summary
Respiratory tract infections are among the deadliest communicable diseases worldwide. Severe cases of viral lung infections are often associated with a cytokine storm and alternating platelet numbers. We report that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) sense a non-systemic influenza A virus (IAV) infection via inflammatory cytokines. Irrespective of antiviral treatment or vaccination, at a certain threshold of IAV titer in the lung, CD41-positive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enter the cell cycle while endothelial protein C receptor-positive CD41-negative HSCs remain quiescent. Active CD41-positive HSCs represent the source of megakaryocytes, while their multi-lineage reconstitution potential is reduced. This emergency megakaryopoiesis is thrombopoietin independent and attenuated in IAV-infected interleukin-1 receptor-deficient mice. Newly produced platelets during IAV infection are immature and hyper-reactive. After viral clearance, HSC quiescence is re-established. Our study reveals that non-systemic viral respiratory infection has an acute impact on HSCs via inflammatory cytokines to counteract IAV-induced thrombocytopenia.

Abstract: Homeostatic regulation of meristematic stem cells accomplished by maintaining a balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is critical for proper plant growth and development. The quiescent center (QC) regulates root apical meristem homeostasis by maintaining stem cell fate during plant root development. Cell cycle checkpoints, such as anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome/cell cycle switch 52 A2 (APC/CCCS52A2), strictly control the low proliferation rate of QC cells. Although APC/CCCS52A2 plays a critical role in maintaining QC cell division, the molecular mechanism that regulates its activity remains largely unknown. Here, we identified SCFFBS1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, as a key regulator of QC cell division through the direct proteolysis of CCS52A2. FBS1 activity is positively associated with QC cell division and CCS52A2 proteolysis. FBS1 overexpression or ccs52a2-1 knockout consistently resulted in abnormal root development, characterized by root growth inhibition and low mitotic activity in the meristematic zone. Loss-of-function mutation of FBS1, on the other hand, resulted in low QC cell division, extremely low WOX5 expression, and rapid root growth. The 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of CCS52A2 was facilitated by its direct interaction with FBS1. The FBS1 genetically interacted with APC/CCCS52A2-ERF115-PSKR1 signaling module for QC division. Thus, our findings establish SCFFBS1-mediated CCS52A2 proteolysis as the molecular mechanism for controlling QC cell division in plants.

Abstract: For the first time, increased Dp71 in ischemia-reperfusion injured rat heart were identified, both Dp71 mRNA and protein reached its peak expression 8 h after reperfusion. In H2O2 stimulated H9c2 cells, Dp71 mRNA and protein gradually increased and reached a peak at 16 h. Enhanced Dp71 in H9c2 could resist H2O2-induced cell apoptosis, while Dp71 depletion accelerated the apoptosis induced by H2O2. Enhanced Bcl-2 expression and Bcl-2∕Bax protein expression ratio was identified in Dp71 overexpressed H9c2 cells, while knocking down Dp71 significantly decreased the Bcl-2 and Bcl-2∕Bax protein expression ratio. Increased Dp71 can accelerate FAK and p65 phosphorylation, which finally resulted in enhanced Bcl-2 expression and explains the highly possible cardiac protection role of Dp71.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful chromosome segregation into gametes depends on Spo11-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These yield single-stranded 3′ tails upon resection to promote crossovers (COs). While early Mre11-dependent end resection is the predominant pathway in most organisms, Exo1 or Dna2/BLM can also contribute to the efficient processing of meiotic DSBs. Although its enzymatic activity has been thoroughly dissected, the temporal dynamics underlying Spo11 activity have remained mostly elusive. We show that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, SPO-11-mediated DSB induction takes place throughout early meiotic prophase I until mid-late pachynema. We find that late DSBs are essential for CO formation and are preferentially processed by EXO-1 and DNA-2 in a redundant fashion. Further, EXO-1-DNA-2-mediated resection ensures completion of conservative DSB repair and discourages activation of KU-dependent end joining. Taken together, our data unveil important temporal aspects of DSB induction and identify previously unknown functional implications for EXO-1-DNA-2-mediated resection activity in C. elegans.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a source from which β cells can be derived for diabetes replacement therapy. However, their application may be hindered by immune-mediated responses. Although abrogation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) can address this issue, it may trigger natural killer (NK) cells through missing-self recognition mechanisms. By profiling the relevant NK-activating ligands on iPSCs during in vitro differentiation into pancreatic β cells, we find that they express high levels of B7-H3 and CD155. Hypothesizing that such surface ligands could be involved in the amplification of NK-activating signals following missing-self, we generate MHC-I-deprived B7-H3−/−, CD155−/−, and B7-H3−/−/CD155−/− iPSCs. All engineered lines correctly differentiate into insulin-secreting β cells and are protected from cell lysis mediated by CD16dim and CD16+ NK subpopulations both in vitro and in vivo in NSG mice. Our data support targeted disruption of NK-activating ligands to enhance the transplant compatibility of MHC-I−/− iPSC pancreatic derivatives.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrence of solid tumors renders patients vulnerable to advanced, treatment-refractory disease state with mutational and oncogenic landscape distinctive from initial diagnosis. Improving outcomes for recurrent cancers requires a better understanding of cell populations that expand from the post-therapy, minimal residual disease (MRD) state. We profile barcoded tumor stem cell populations through therapy at tumor initiation, MRD, and recurrence in our therapy-adapted, patient-derived xenograft models of glioblastoma (GBM). Tumors show distinct patterns of recurrence in which clonal populations exhibit either a pre-existing fitness advantage or an equipotency fitness acquired through therapy. Characterization of the MRD state by single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing reveals a tumor-intrinsic immunomodulatory signature with prognostic significance at the transcriptomic level and in proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients with GBM. Our results provide insight into the innate and therapy-driven dynamics of human GBM and the prognostic value of interrogating the MRD state in solid cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal mucosa exists in a state of “physiologic hypoxia,” where oxygen tensions are markedly lower than those in other tissues. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) have evolved to maintain homeostasis in this austere environment through oxygen-sensitive transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Using an unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) screen for HIF-1 targets, we identify autophagy as a major pathway induced by hypoxia in IECs. One important function of autophagy is to defend against intracellular pathogens, termed “xenophagy.” Analysis reveals that HIF is a central regulator of autophagy and that in vitro infection of IECs with Salmonella Typhimurium results in induction of HIF transcriptional activity that tracks with the clearance of intracellular Salmonella. Work in vivo demonstrates that IEC-specific deletion of HIF compromises xenophagy and exacerbates bacterial dissemination. These results reveal that the interaction between hypoxia, HIF, and xenophagy is an essential innate immune component for the control of intracellular pathogens.

Abstract: Schneiderian membrane is an indispensable structure for osteogenesis under the sinus floor space after maxillary sinus floor elevation.Therefore,this study aimed to compare the Schneiderian membrane and palatine mucoperiosteum in various aspects to explore whether the Schneiderian membrane has a periosteal layer and osteogenic ability. Schneiderian membrane and palatine mucoperiosteum specimens were collected and stained with HE, Masson, and Sirius red. Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the expression and localization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Then MSCs from two tissues were isolated,cultured, and identified. The expression of osteogenic markers OCN, RUNX2, and BMP2 ware detected by Western blotting and quantitative PCR after osteogenic differentiation.The morphological observations revealed both the Schneiderian membrane and palatine mucoperiosteum were composed of three layers.Immunofluorescence staining showed that the inner bone surface layer of the Schneiderian membrane was rich in MSCs, which was similar to the cambium layer of the palatine mucoperiosteum.In addition, MSCs from two tissues showed similar morphological phenotype. After further osteogenic induction of the two groups, the expression of BMP2, RUNX2, and OCN were significantly increased. This study provide a novel insight into that Schneiderian membrane is a mucoperiosteal membrane rich of MSCs, containing a periosteal layer and osteogenic ability similar to mucoperiosteum.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are supported and regulated by niche cells in the bone marrow with an important characterization of physiological hypoxia. However, how hypoxia regulates HSPCs is still unclear. Here, we find that meteorin (Metrn) from hypoxic macrophages restrains HSPC mobilization. Hypoxia-induced factor 1α and Yin Yang 1 induce the high expression of Metrn in macrophages, and macrophage-specific Metrn knockout increases HSPC mobilization through modulating HSPC proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, Metrn interacts with its receptor 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2b (Htr2b) to regulate the reactive oxygen species levels in HSPCs through targeting phospholipase C signaling. The reactive oxygen species levels are reduced in HSPCs of macrophage-specific Metrn knockout mice with activated phospholipase C signaling. Targeting the Metrn/Htr2b axis could therefore be a potential strategy to improve HSPC mobilization for stem cell-based therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Gene transcription is a highly regulated process in all animals. In Drosophila, two major transcriptional programs, housekeeping and developmental, have promoters with distinct regulatory compatibilities and nucleosome organization. However, it remains unclear how the differences in chromatin structure relate to the distinct regulatory properties and which chromatin remodelers are required for these programs. Using rapid degradation of core remodeler subunits in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, we demonstrate that developmental gene transcription requires SWI/SNF-type complexes, primarily to maintain distal enhancer accessibility. In contrast, wild-type-level housekeeping gene transcription requires the Iswi and Ino80 remodelers to maintain nucleosome positioning and phasing at promoters. These differential remodeler dependencies relate to different DNA-sequence-intrinsic nucleosome affinities, which favor a default ON state for housekeeping but a default OFF state for developmental gene transcription. Overall, our results demonstrate how different transcription-regulatory strategies are implemented by DNA sequence, chromatin structure, and remodeler activity.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that bind cognate DNA motif sequences in cis-regulatory elements (CREs). The combinations of DNA motifs acting within homeostasis and disease, however, are unclear. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, TF footprinting, and H3K27ac-dependent DNA looping data were generated and a random-forest-based model was applied to identify 7,531 cell-type-specific cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across 15 diploid human cell types. A co-enrichment framework within CRMs nominated 838 cell-type-specific, recurrent heterotypic DNA motif combinations (DMCs), which were functionally validated using massively parallel reporter assays. Cancer cells engaged DMCs linked to neoplasia-enabling processes operative in normal cells while also activating new DMCs only seen in the neoplastic state. This integrative approach identifies cell-type-specific cis-regulatory combinatorial DNA motifs in diverse normal and diseased human cells and represents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory sequence logic in gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The biosynthesis of thousands of proteins requires targeting a signal sequence or transmembrane segment (TM) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These hydrophobic ɑ helices must localize to the appropriate cellular membrane and integrate in the correct topology to maintain a high-fidelity proteome. Here, we show that the P5A-ATPase ATP13A1 prevents the accumulation of mislocalized and misoriented proteins, which are eliminated by different ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways in mammalian cells. Without ATP13A1, mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins mislocalize to the ER through the ER membrane protein complex and are cleaved by signal peptide peptidase for ERAD. ATP13A1 also facilitates the topogenesis of a subset of proteins with an N-terminal TM or signal sequence that should insert into the ER membrane with a cytosolic N terminus. Without ATP13A1, such proteins accumulate in the wrong orientation and are targeted for ERAD by distinct ubiquitin ligases. Thus, ATP13A1 prevents ERAD of diverse proteins capable of proper folding.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) enhance survival in response to environmental changes. In yeast, the Hog1 SAPK and Mrc1, a protein required for DNA replication, define a safeguard mechanism that allows eukaryotic cells to prevent genomic instability upon stress during S-phase. Here we show that, in mammals, the p38 SAPK and Claspin—the functional homolog of Mrc1—protect cells from DNA damage upon osmostress during S-phase. We demonstrate that p38 phosphorylates Claspin and either the mutation of the p38-phosphorylation sites in Claspin or p38 inhibition suppresses the protective role of Claspin on DNA damage. In addition, wild-type Claspin but not the p38-unphosphorylatable mutant has a protective effect on cell survival in response to cisplatin treatment. These findings reveal a role of Claspin in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus, this pathway protects S-phase integrity from different insults and it is conserved from yeast to mammals.

Abstract: Osteoclast generation from monocyte/macrophage lineage precursor cells needs to be tightly regulated to maintain bone homeostasis and is frequently over-activated in inflammatory conditions. PARK2, a protein associated with Parkinson’s disease, plays an important role in mitophagy via its ubiquitin ligase function. In this study, we investigated whether PARK2 is involved in osteoclastogenesis. PARK2 expression was found to be increased during the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. PARK2 gene silencing with siRNA significantly reduced osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL, LPS (lipopolysaccharide), TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α), and IL-1β (interleukin-1β). On the other hand, overexpression of PARK2 promoted osteoclastogenesis. This regulation of osteoclastogenesis by PARK2 was mediated by IKK (inhibitory κB kinase) and NF-κB activation while MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) activation was not involved. Additionally, administration of PARK2 siRNA significantly reduced osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in an in vivo model of inflammatory bone erosion. Taken together, this study establishes a novel role for PARK2 as a positive regulator in osteoclast differentiation and inflammatory bone destruction.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) subunits are thought to be involved in various transcription-associated processes, but it is unclear whether they play different regulatory roles in modulating gene expression. Here, we performed nascent and mature transcript sequencing after the acute degradation of 12 mammalian RNA Pol II subunits and profiled their genomic binding sites and protein interactomes to dissect their molecular functions. We found that RNA Pol II subunits contribute differently to RNA Pol II cellular localization and transcription processes and preferentially regulate RNA processing (such as RNA splicing and 3′ end maturation). Genes sensitive to the depletion of different RNA Pol II subunits tend to be involved in diverse biological functions and show different RNA half-lives. Sequences, associated protein factors, and RNA structures are correlated with RNA Pol II subunit-mediated differential gene expression. These findings collectively suggest that the heterogeneity of RNA Pol II and different genes appear to depend on some of the subunits.

Abstract: Summary
The intimate communication between the vascular and nervous systems is critical for maintaining central nervous system (CNS) development. However, whether cerebrovascular endothelial cells (ECs) can orchestrate neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation and differentiation, and the identity of the signals involved therein, is unclear. Here, we find that the development of ECs is often accompanied by DNA damage. RNF20, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is required for the DNA damage response (DDR). The deletion of RNF20 causes the accumulation of DNA damage in ECs, which fails to secrete cartilage intermediate layer protein 2 (CILP2). Moreover, the loss of endothelium-derived CILP2 alters the downstream cascade signaling of Wnt signaling pathways through the interaction with Wnt3a, which disturbs the NPC fate and causes autism-like behaviors in mice. Therefore, the close and refined controlled neurovascular interactions ensure the normal operation of neurogenesis during embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a childhood-onset cerebellar ataxia caused by mutations in SACS, which encodes the protein sacsin. Cellular ARSACS phenotypes include mitochondrial dysfunction, intermediate filament disorganization, and progressive death of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. It is unclear why the loss of sacsin causes these deficits or why they manifest as cerebellar ataxia. Here, we perform multi-omic profiling in sacsin knockout (KO) cells and identify alterations in microtubule dynamics and mislocalization of focal adhesion (FA) proteins, including multiple integrins. Deficits in FA structure, signaling, and function can be rescued by targeting PTEN, a negative regulator of FA signaling. ARSACS mice possess mislocalization of ITGA1 in Purkinje neurons and synaptic disorganization in the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN). The sacsin interactome reveals that sacsin regulates interactions between cytoskeletal and synaptic adhesion proteins. Our findings suggest that disrupted trafficking of synaptic adhesion proteins is a causal molecular deficit in ARSACS.

Abstract: Summary
The effects of fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) cycles in reducing many aging and disease risk factors indicate it could affect Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we show that FMD cycles reduce cognitive decline and AD pathology in E4FAD and 3xTg AD mouse models, with effects superior to those caused by protein restriction cycles. In 3xTg mice, long-term FMD cycles reduce hippocampal Aβ load and hyperphosphorylated tau, enhance genesis of neural stem cells, decrease microglia number, and reduce expression of neuroinflammatory genes, including superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase (Nox2). 3xTg mice lacking Nox2 or mice treated with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin also display improved cognition and reduced microglia activation compared with controls. Clinical data indicate that FMD cycles are feasible and generally safe in a small group of AD patients. These results indicate that FMD cycles delay cognitive decline in AD models in part by reducing neuroinflammation and/or superoxide production in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
To promote infections, pathogens exploit host cell machineries such as structural elements of the plasma membrane. Studying these interactions and identifying molecular players are ideal for gaining insights into the fundamental biology of the host cell. Here, we used the anthrax toxin to screen a library of 1,500 regulatory, cell-surface, and membrane trafficking genes for their involvement in the intoxication process. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-localized proteins TMED2 and TMED10 are required for toxin oligomerization at the plasma membrane of human cells, an essential step dependent on localization to cholesterol-rich lipid nanodomains. Biochemical, morphological, and mechanistic analyses showed that TMED2 and TMED10 are essential components of a supercomplex that operates the exchange of both cholesterol and ceramides at ER-Golgi membrane contact sites. Overall, this study of anthrax intoxication led to the discovery that lipid compositional remodeling at ER-Golgi interfaces fully controls the formation of functional membrane nanodomains at the cell surface.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular fate after infection with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) is typically death. Previous data suggest, however, that the transcriptional state of an individual cell may sometimes allow additional outcomes of infection. Here, to probe the range of interactions a permissive cell type can have with a HCoV, we perform a CRISPR activation screen with HCoV-229E. The screen identified the transcription factor ZBTB7A, which strongly promotes cell survival after infection. Rather than suppressing viral infection, ZBTB7A upregulation allows the virus to induce a persistent infection and homeostatic state with the cell. We also find that control of oxidative stress is a primary driver of cellular survival during HCoV-229E infection. These data illustrate that, in addition to the nature of the infecting virus and the type of cell that it encounters, the cellular gene expression profile prior to infection can affect the eventual fate.

Abstract: Summary
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most frequent and lethal malignancies in the world. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying its initiation and progression is limited. Here, we generate a series of primary GC models in mice with genome-edited gastric organoids, which elucidate the genetic drivers for sequential transformation from dysplasia to well-differentiated and poorly differentiated GC. Further, we find that the orthotopic GC, but not the subcutaneous GC even with the same genetic drivers, display remote metastasis, suggesting critical roles of the microenvironment in GC metastasis. Through single-cell RNA-seq analyses and functional studies, we show that the interaction between fibronectin 1 on stomach-specific macrophages and integrin a6β4 on GC cells promotes remote metastases. Taken together, our studies propose a strategy to model GC and dissect the genetic and microenvironmental factors driving the full-range gastric tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In this study, the gene that encodes a heme-binding protein in the pulmonary surfactant (PS) of the pika is identified. The protein is a homotetrameric hemoglobin (δ4) encoded by HBD (δ). HBD is expressed in alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) and type I (ATI) cells, upregulated by hypoxia. δ4 is secreted into alveolar cavities through osmiophilic multilamellar bodies. HBD expression is downregulated by RNAi, which significantly increases hypoxia-inducible factor 1α expression in lung tissue and red blood cells and hemoglobin and blood lactate concentrations but significantly decreases arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). Our results indicate that plateau pikas physiologically show hypoxemia when HBD expression is downregulated. Therefore, specific HBD expression in the lungs helps plateau pikas to obtain oxygen under hypoxia by maintaining higher PaO2. These findings provide insights into the adaptive mechanisms of plateau pikas to withstand high-altitude environments.

Abstract: Summary
Myelin transcription factor 1 like (Myt1l), a zinc-finger transcription factor, promotes neuronal differentiation and is implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether Myt1l promotes neuronal differentiation in vivo and its deficiency in mice leads to disease-related phenotypes. Here, we report that Myt1l-heterozygous mutant (Myt1l-HT) mice display postnatal age-differential ASD-related phenotypes: newborn Myt1l-HT mice, with strong Myt1l expression, show ASD-like transcriptomic changes involving decreased synaptic gene expression and prefrontal excitatory synaptic transmission and altered righting reflex. Juvenile Myt1l-HT mice, with markedly decreased Myt1l expression, display reverse ASD-like transcriptomes, increased prefrontal excitatory transmission, and largely normal behaviors. Adult Myt1l-HT mice show ASD-like transcriptomes involving astrocytic and microglial gene upregulation, increased prefrontal inhibitory transmission, and behavioral deficits. Therefore, Myt1l haploinsufficiency leads to ASD-related phenotypes in newborn mice, which are temporarily normalized in juveniles but re-appear in adults, pointing to continuing phenotypic changes long after a marked decrease of Myt1l expression in juveniles.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes transfer mitochondria to macrophages in white and brown adipose tissues to maintain metabolic homeostasis. In obesity, adipocyte-to-macrophage mitochondria transfer is impaired, and instead, adipocytes release mitochondria into the blood to induce a protective antioxidant response in the heart. We found that adipocyte-to-macrophage mitochondria transfer in white adipose tissue is inhibited in murine obesity elicited by a lard-based high-fat diet, but not a hydrogenated-coconut-oil-based high-fat diet, aging, or a corn-starch diet. The long-chain fatty acids enriched in lard suppress mitochondria capture by macrophages, diverting adipocyte-derived mitochondria into the blood for delivery to other organs, such as the heart. The depletion of macrophages rapidly increased the number of adipocyte-derived mitochondria in the blood. These findings suggest that dietary lipids regulate mitochondria uptake by macrophages locally in white adipose tissue to determine whether adipocyte-derived mitochondria are released into systemic circulation to support the metabolic adaptation of distant organs in response to nutrient stress.

Abstract: Summary
The human microbiome plays an important role in autoimmune diseases. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the microbiota in individuals with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS). Here, we perform 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of fecal, oral, and vaginal samples from a cohort of 133 individuals with pSS, 56 with non-pSS, and 40 healthy control (HC) individuals. Dysbiosis in the gut, oral, and vaginal microbiome is evident in patients with pSS, and oral samples demonstrate the greatest extent of microbial variation. Multiple key indicator bacteria and clinical characteristics are identified across different body sites, implying that microbial dysbiosis has important roles in the pathogenesis of pSS. Furthermore, we observe pSS-like dysbiosis in individuals with pre-clinical pSS or non-pSS-related disease, revealing that microbial shifts could appear prior to pSS. After hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment, microbial dysbiosis in individuals with pSS is partially resolved, although the microbiota composition remain disordered. These results contribute to the overall understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and pSS.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) typically direct degradation of their mRNA targets. However, some targets have unusual miRNA-binding sites that direct degradation of cognate miRNAs. Although this target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) is thought to shape the levels of numerous miRNAs, relatively few sites that endogenously direct degradation have been identified. Here, we identify six sites, five in mRNAs and one in a noncoding RNA named Marge, which serve this purpose in Drosophila cells or embryos. These six sites direct miRNA degradation without collateral target degradation, helping explain the effectiveness of this miRNA-degradation pathway. Mutations that disrupt this pathway are lethal, with many flies dying as embryos. Concomitant derepression of miR-3 and its paralog miR-309 appears responsible for some of this lethality, whereas the loss of Marge-directed degradation of miR-310 miRNAs causes defects in embryonic cuticle development.

Abstract: Summary
The egress of Candida hyphae from macrophages facilitates immune evasion, but it also alerts macrophages to infection and triggers inflammation. To better define the mechanisms, here we develop an imaging assay to directly and dynamically quantify hyphal escape and correlate it to macrophage responses. The assay reveals that Candida escapes by using two pore-forming proteins to permeabilize macrophage membranes: the fungal toxin candidalysin and Nlrp3 inflammasome-activated Gasdermin D. Candidalysin plays a major role in escape, with Nlrp3 and Gasdermin D-dependent and -independent contributions. The inactivation of Nlrp3 does not reduce hyphal escape, and we identify ETosis via macrophage extracellular trap formation as an additional pathway facilitating hyphal escape. Suppressing hyphal escape does not reduce fungal loads, but it does reduce inflammatory activation. Our findings explain how Candida escapes from macrophages by using three strategies: permeabilizing macrophage membranes via candidalysin and engaging two host cell death pathways, Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis and ETosis.

Abstract: Phagocytosis is an essential component of our immune defence against fungal pathogens. Differences in the dynamics of phagocyte migration, recognition, uptake and phagolysosome maturation are dependent on the characteristics of the fungal cargo, and in particular to differences in cell wall composition and cellular morphology. However, studies that have focused on phagocyte interactions with individual fungal species have not enabled comparisons in the kinetics of these interactions to be made between these different species. We therefore used live cell video microscopy to examine the temporal dynamics of phagocytosis for a range of fungal cargoes by thioglycollate–elicited peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice. Uniform populations of macrophages were challenged at the same time with yeast cells of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans (wild–type and an acapsular mutant, cap59Δ), and spores of Aspergillus fumigatus and Mucor circinelloides to enable standardized comparative interactions to be quantified from different stages of phagocytosis. Differences in the rate of uptake of fungal cells varied by up to 26–fold, whilst differences in time to induce phagosome acidification varied by as much as 29–fold. Heat-killing or opsonizing the fungal targets markedly affected the kinetics of the interaction in a species–specific manner. Fungal and macrophage killing assays further revealed cargo–specific differences in phagocytosis and diversity in fungal evasion mechanisms. Therefore, simultaneous assessment of the interaction of macrophages with different fungal pathogens highlighted major differences in the kinetics and growth responses during fungus–phagocyte interactions that are likely to impact on pathogenesis and virulence.

Abstract: Summary
Melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) expressed by the central nervous system are essential regulators of energy homeostasis, and Mc4r mutation is the most common cause of human monogenic obesity. Notably, patients with obesity carrying Mc4r mutations are protected against obesity-induced hypertension, and MC4R agonists elevate blood pressure (BP). Although increased sympathetic tone by MC4Rs is suggested to underlie this phenotype, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate how MC4Rs regulate the sympathetic preganglionic neurons and find that MC4Rs activate these neurons via the protein kinase A-dependent activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. Importantly, we demonstrate that the inhibition of TRPV1 prevents MC4R-induced elevation of BP but does not affect MC4R-induced anorexia. We further show that TRPV1 is responsible for MC4R-dependent activation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons by high-fat diet. Together, our results provide insight into how MC4Rs regulate sympathetic function.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise training is critical for the prevention and treatment of obesity, but its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood given the challenge of profiling heterogeneous effects across multiple tissues and cell types. Here, we address this challenge and opposing effects of exercise and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity at single-cell resolution in subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in mice with diet and exercise training interventions. We identify a prominent role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in obesity and exercise-induced tissue adaptation. Among the pathways regulated by exercise and HFD in MSCs across the three tissues, extracellular matrix remodeling and circadian rhythm are the most prominent. Inferred cell-cell interactions implicate within- and multi-tissue crosstalk centered around MSCs. Overall, our work reveals the intricacies and diversity of multi-tissue molecular responses to exercise and obesity and uncovers a previously underappreciated role of MSCs in tissue-specific and multi-tissue beneficial effects of exercise.

Abstract: Summary
Allele-specific expression of imprinted gene clusters is governed by gametic DNA methylation at master regulators called imprinting control regions (ICRs). Non-gametic or secondary differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at promoters and exonic regions reinforce monoallelic expression but do not control an entire cluster. Here, we unveil an unconventional secondary DMR that is indispensable for tissue-specific imprinting of two previously unlinked genes, Grb10 and Ddc. Using polymorphic mice, we mapped an intronic secondary DMR at Grb10 with paternal-specific CTCF binding (CBR2.3) that forms contacts with Ddc. Deletion of paternal CBR2.3 removed a critical insulator, resulting in substantial shifting of chromatin looping and ectopic enhancer-promoter contacts. Destabilized gene architecture precipitated abnormal Grb10-Ddc expression with developmental consequences in the heart and muscle. Thus, we redefine the Grb10-Ddc imprinting domain by uncovering an unconventional intronic secondary DMR that functions as an insulator to instruct the tissue-specific, monoallelic expression of multiple genes—a feature previously ICR exclusive.

Abstract: Summary
Growing evidence suggests prevalence of transcriptional condensates on chromatin, yet their mechanisms of formation and functional significance remain largely unclear. In human cancer, a series of mutations in the histone acetylation reader ENL create gain-of-function mutants with increased transcriptional activation ability. Here, we show that these mutations, clustered in ENL’s structured acetyl-reading YEATS domain, trigger aberrant condensates at native genomic targets through multivalent homotypic and heterotypic interactions. Mechanistically, mutation-induced structural changes in the YEATS domain, ENL’s two disordered regions of opposing charges, and the incorporation of extrinsic elongation factors are all required for ENL condensate formation. Extensive mutagenesis establishes condensate formation as a driver of oncogenic gene activation. Furthermore, expression of ENL mutants beyond the endogenous level leads to non-functional condensates. Our findings provide new mechanistic and functional insights into cancer-associated condensates and support condensate dysregulation as an oncogenic mechanism.

Abstract: KRAS-LKB1 (KL) mutant lung cancers silence STING owing to intrinsic mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in T cell exclusion and resistance to programmed cell death (ligand) 1 (PD-[L]1) blockade. Here we discover that KL cells also minimize intracellular accumulation of 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (2′3′-cGAMP) to further avoid downstream STING and STAT1 activation. An unbiased screen to co-opt this vulnerability reveals that transient MPS1 inhibition (MPS1i) potently re-engages this pathway in KL cells via micronuclei generation. This effect is markedly amplified by epigenetic de-repression of STING and only requires pulse MPS1i treatment, creating a therapeutic window compared with non-dividing cells. A single course of decitabine treatment followed by pulse MPS1i therapy restores T cell infiltration in vivo, enhances anti-PD-1 efficacy, and results in a durable response without evidence of significant toxicity.

Abstract: The present study investigated the protective effect of misoprostol (MSP) (0.2 mg/kg, oral) against kidney injury caused by paclitaxel (PLX) (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) in female Sprague Dawley rats. Twenty-eight 8-week-old rats were used and divided randomly into four equal groups (n = 7): control, MSP, PLX, and PLX+MSP. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level, serum creatinine (Cr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in the PLX group compared to the control group (p < 0.05), while superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) were decreased (p < 0.05). In the PLX+MSP group, levels of serum Cr, and BUN were significantly decreased than the MSP group (p < 0.05). Further, lower level of MDA, and higher activity of GSH, SOD, and CAT was detected in the PLX+MSP than the PLX group (p < 0.05). In the PLX group, we also found a significant decrease in the total number of glomeruli and the mean volumes of cortex, medulla, and kidney compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Besides, these stereological parameters were improved in the PLX+MSP group than the PLX group (p < 0.05). We speculated that administration of MSP attenuated the toxic effect of PLX on kidney tissue due to its antioxidative and anti-apoptotic efficacy of MSP.

Abstract: Summary
With age, senescence-associated (SA) CD4+ T cells that are refractory to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation are increased along with spontaneous germinal center (Spt-GC) development prone to autoantibody production. We demonstrate that CD153 and its receptor CD30 are expressed in SA-T and Spt-GC B cells, respectively, and deficiency of either CD153 or CD30 results in the compromised increase of both cell types. CD153 engagement on SA-T cells upon TCR stimulation causes association of CD153 with the TCR/CD3 complex and restores TCR signaling, whereas CD30 engagement on GC B cells induces their expansion. Administration of an anti-CD153 antibody blocking the interaction with CD30 suppresses the increase in both SA-T and Spt-GC B cells with age and ameliorates lupus in lupus-prone mice. These results suggest that the molecular interaction of CD153 and CD30 plays a central role in the reciprocal activation of SA-T and Spt-GC B cells, leading to immunosenescent phenotypes and autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Many developmental signaling pathways have been implicated in lineage-specific differentiation; however, mechanisms that explicitly control differentiation timing remain poorly defined in mammals. We report that murine Hedgehog signaling is a heterochronic pathway that determines the timing of progenitor differentiation. Hedgehog activity was necessary to prevent premature differentiation of second heart field (SHF) cardiac progenitors in mouse embryos, and the Hedgehog transcription factor GLI1 was sufficient to delay differentiation of cardiac progenitors in vitro. GLI1 directly activated a de novo progenitor-specific network in vitro, akin to that of SHF progenitors in vivo, which prevented the onset of the cardiac differentiation program. A Hedgehog signaling-dependent active-to-repressive GLI transition functioned as a differentiation timer, restricting the progenitor network to the SHF. GLI1 expression was associated with progenitor status across germ layers, and it delayed the differentiation of neural progenitors in vitro, suggesting a broad role for Hedgehog signaling as a heterochronic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Infection by the Ebola virus, a member of the Filoviridae family of RNA viruses, leads to acute viral hemorrhagic fever. End-stage Ebola virus disease is characterized by a cytokine storm that causes tissue damage, vascular disintegration, and multi-organ failure. Previous studies showed that a shed form of the viral spike glycoprotein (sGP1,2) drives this hyperinflammatory response by activating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, we find that glycosylation is not required for activation of TLR4 by sGP1,2 and identify the internal fusion loop (IFL) as essential for inflammatory signaling. sGP1,2 competes with lipid antagonists of TLR4, and the IFL interacts directly with TLR4 and co-receptor MD2. Together, these findings indicate that sGP1,2 activates TLR4 analogously to bacterial agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by binding into a hydrophobic pocket in MD2 and promoting the formation of an active heterotetramer. This conclusion is supported by docking studies that predict binding sites for sGP1,2 on TLR4 and MD2.

Abstract: Summary
Deubiquitinating enzymes are key regulators of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and cell cycle, and their dysfunction leads to tumorigenesis. Our in vivo drop-out screens in patient-derived xenograft models identify USP7 as a regulator of melanoma. We show that USP7 downregulation induces cellular senescence, arresting melanoma growth in vivo and proliferation in vitro in BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma. We provide a comprehensive understanding of targets and networks affected by USP7 depletion by performing a global transcriptomic and proteomics analysis. We show that RRM2 is a USP7 target and is regulated by USP7 during S phase of the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of RRM2 in USP7-depleted cells rescues the senescent phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of USP7 by P5091 phenocopies the shUSP7-induced senescent phenotype. We show that the bifunctional histone deacetylase (HDAC)/LSD1 inhibitor domatinostat has an additive antitumor effect, eliminating P5091-induced senescent cells, paving the way to a therapeutic combination for individuals with melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Upregulation of interleukin-17 receptor B (IL-17RB) is known to be oncogenic, while other IL-17 receptors and ligands are generally involved in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identify a mouse neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) D9, which blocks the IL-17RB/IL-17B pathway and inhibits pancreatic tumorigenesis in an orthotopic mouse model. The X-ray crystal structure of the IL-17RB ectodomain in complex with its neutralizing antibody D9 shows that D9 binds to a predicted ligand binding interface and engages with the A′-A loop of IL-17RB fibronectin III domain 1 in a unique conformational state. This structure also provides important paratope information to guide the design of antibody humanization and affinity maturation of D9, resulting in a humanized 1B12 antibody with marginal affinity loss and effective neutralization of IL-17B/IL-17RB signaling to impede tumorigenesis in a mouse xenograft model.

Abstract: Carboplatin-based chemotherapy is the primary treatment option for the management of retinoblastoma, an intraocular malignant tumor observed in children. The aim of the present study was to establish carboplatin-resistant retinoblastoma cell lines to facilitate future research into the treatment of chemoresistant retinoblastoma. In total, two retinoblastoma cell lines, Y79 and SNUOT-Rb1, were treated with increasing concentrations of carboplatin to develop the carboplatin-resistant retinoblastoma cell lines (termed Y79/CBP and SNUOT-Rb1/CBP, respectively). To verify resistance to carboplatin, the degree of DNA fragmentation and the expression level of cleaved caspase-3 were evaluated in the cells, following carboplatin treatment. In addition, the newly developed carboplatin-resistant retinoblastoma cells formed in vivo intraocular tumors more effectively than their parental cells, even after the intravitreal injection of carboplatin. Interestingly, the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase was higher in Y79/CBP and SNUOT-Rb1/CBP cells than in their respective parental cells. In line with these data, the expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 were decreased, whereas p18 and p27 expression was increased in the carboplatin-resistant cells. In addition, the expression levels of genes associated with multidrug resistance were increased. Thus, these carboplatin-resistant cell lines may serve as a useful tool in the study of chemoresistance in retinoblastoma and for the development potential therapeutics.

Abstract: The mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, which is important to regulate bioenergetics, cell death and cytoplasmic Ca2+ signaling, is mediated via the calcium uniporter complex (MCUC). In animal cells the MCUC is regulated by the mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 and 2 dimer (MICU1/MICU2), which has been proposed to act as gatekeeper preventing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload at low cytosolic Ca2+ levels. In contrast to animal cells, knockout of either MICU1 or MICU2 in Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, did not allow Ca2+ uptake at low extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]ext) and it was though that in the absence of one MICU the other would replace its role. However, previous attempts to knockout both genes were unsuccessful. Here, we designed a strategy to generate TcMICU1/TcMICU2 double knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Ablation of both genes was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. The absence of both proteins did not allow Ca2+ uptake at low [Ca2+]ext, significantly decreased the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake at different [Ca2+]ext, without dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased the [Ca2+]ext set point needed for Ca2+ uptake, as we have seen with TcMICU1-KO and TcMICU2-KO cells. Mg2+ was found to be a negative regulator of MCUC-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake at different [Ca2+]ext. Occlusion of the MCUC pore by Mg2+ could partially explain the lack of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake at low [Ca2+]ext in TcMICU1/TcMICU2-KO cells. In addition, TcMICU1/TcMICU2-KO epimastigotes had a lower growth rate, while infective trypomastigotes have a reduced capacity to invade host cells and to replicate within them as amastigotes.

Abstract: Summary
The role of intestinal microbiota on fate determination of intestinal epithelial cells has not been extensively examined. In this study, we explore the effect of Bacillus subtilis on programmed intestinal epithelial differentiation. We find that B. subtilis stimulates the differentiation of intestinal secretory cells. Moreover, B. subtilis inhibits the Notch pathway to reduce the expression of hairy and enhancer of split 1, thereby shifting intestinal stem cell differentiation toward a secretory cell fate. Moreover, we demonstrate that the programming effect of B. subtilis on intestinal differentiation is Toll-like receptor 2 pathway dependent. B. subtilis is associated with increased numbers of Paneth and goblet cells in the intestine. This results in the production of antimicrobial peptides to protect the intestinal mucosal barrier against Salmonella typhimurium. This study demonstrates that B. subtilis contributes to the differentiation of secretory cells by affecting Notch pathway signaling to maintain the intestinal barrier.

Abstract: Summary
Many breast cancer (BC) patients suffer from complications of metastatic disease. To form metastases, cancer cells must become migratory and coordinate both invasive and proliferative programs at distant organs. Here, we identify srGAP1 as a regulator of a proliferative-to-invasive switch in BC cells. High-resolution light-sheet microscopy demonstrates that BC cells can form actin-rich protrusions during extravasation. srGAP1low cells display a motile and invasive phenotype that facilitates their extravasation from blood vessels, as shown in zebrafish and mouse models, while attenuating tumor growth. Interestingly, a population of srGAP1low cells remain as solitary disseminated tumor cells in the lungs of mice bearing BC tumors. Overall, srGAP1low cells have increased Smad2 activation and TGF-β2 secretion, resulting in increased invasion and p27 levels to sustain quiescence. These findings identify srGAP1 as a mediator of a proliferative to invasive phenotypic switch in BC cells in vivo through a TGF-β2-mediated signaling axis.

Abstract: Summary
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an essential synapse whose loss is a key hallmark of the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, we show that activity of the SMA-determining SMN protein in the assembly of U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)—which functions in the 3′-end processing of replication-dependent histone mRNAs—is required for NMJ integrity. Co-expression of U7-specific Lsm10 and Lsm11 proteins selectively enhances U7 snRNP assembly, corrects histone mRNA processing defects, and rescues key structural and functional abnormalities of neuromuscular pathology in SMA mice—including NMJ denervation, decreased synaptic transmission, and skeletal muscle atrophy. Furthermore, U7 snRNP dysfunction drives selective loss of the synaptic organizing protein Agrin at NMJs innervating vulnerable muscles of SMA mice. These findings reveal a direct contribution of U7 snRNP dysfunction to neuromuscular pathology in SMA and suggest a role for histone gene regulation in maintaining functional synaptic connections between motor neurons and muscles.

Abstract: Summary
Despite a strong genetic component, only a few genes have been identified in congenital heart diseases (CHDs). We introduced systems analyses to uncover the hidden organization on biological networks of mutations in CHDs and leveraged network analysis to integrate the protein interactome, patient exomes, and single-cell transcriptomes of the developing heart. We identified a CHD network regulating heart development and observed that a sub-network also regulates fetal brain development, thereby providing mechanistic insights into the clinical comorbidities between CHDs and neurodevelopmental conditions. At a small scale, we experimentally verified uncharacterized cardiac functions of several proteins. At a global scale, our study revealed developmental dynamics of the network and observed its association with the hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), which was further supported by the dysregulation of the network in HLHS endothelial cells. Overall, our work identified previously uncharacterized CHD factors and provided a generalizable framework applicable to studying many other complex diseases. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are the most abundant cellular RNAs, and their synthesis from rDNA repeats by RNA polymerase I accounts for the bulk of all transcription. Despite substantial variation in rRNA transcription rates across cell types, little is known about cell-type-specific factors that bind rDNA and regulate rRNA transcription to meet tissue-specific needs. Using hematopoiesis as a model system, we mapped about 2,200 ChIP-seq datasets for 250 transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin proteins to human and mouse rDNA and identified robust binding of multiple TF families to canonical TF motifs on rDNA. Using a 47S-FISH-Flow assay developed for nascent rRNA quantification, we demonstrated that targeted degradation of C/EBP alpha (CEBPA), a critical hematopoietic TF with conserved rDNA binding, caused rapid reduction in rRNA transcription due to reduced RNA Pol I occupancy. Our work identifies numerous potential rRNA regulators and provides a template for dissection of TF roles in rRNA transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a redox-active lipid essential for core metabolic pathways and antioxidant defense. CoQ is synthesized upon the mitochondrial inner membrane by an ill-defined “complex Q” metabolon. Here, we present structure-function analyses of a lipid-, substrate-, and NADH-bound complex comprising two complex Q subunits: the hydroxylase COQ7 and the lipid-binding protein COQ9. We reveal that COQ7 adopts a ferritin-like fold with a hydrophobic channel whose substrate-binding capacity is enhanced by COQ9. Using molecular dynamics, we further show that two COQ7:COQ9 heterodimers form a curved tetramer that deforms the membrane, potentially opening a pathway for the CoQ intermediates to translocate from the bilayer to the proteins’ lipid-binding sites. Two such tetramers assemble into a soluble octamer with a pseudo-bilayer of lipids captured within. Together, these observations indicate that COQ7 and COQ9 cooperate to access hydrophobic precursors within the membrane and coordinate subsequent synthesis steps toward producing CoQ.

Abstract: Summary
Human chromosomes are pervasively transcribed, but systematic understanding of coding and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genome function in cell differentiation is lacking. Using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in human induced pluripotent stem cells, we performed dual genome-wide screens—assessing 18,905 protein-coding and 10,678 lncRNA loci—and identified 419 coding and 201 lncRNA genes that regulate neural induction. Integrative analyses revealed distinct properties of coding and lncRNA genome function, including a 10-fold enrichment of lncRNA genes for roles in differentiation compared with proliferation. Further, we applied CRISPRi perturbation coupled with single-cell RNA-seq (Perturb-seq) to obtain granular insights into neural induction phenotypes. While most coding hits stalled or aborted differentiation, lncRNA hits were enriched for the genesis of diverse cellular states, including those outside the neural lineage. In addition to providing a rich resource for understanding coding and lncRNA gene function in development, these results indicate that the lncRNA genome regulates lineage commitment in a manner fundamentally distinct from coding genes.

Abstract: The proliferation and migration of Schwann cells is pivotal to peripheral nerve injury (PNI) repair. Recent studies have revealed that Ginkgetin has neuroprotective effects. Hence, we focused on identifying whether Ginkgetin could regulate the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells, thereby contributing to the repair of PNI. Rat Schwann cells RSC96 were treated with different concentrations of Ginkgetin. Short hairpin RNA targeting phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class F (shPIGF) was employed to investigate the effects of PIGF on Ginkgetin-induced RSC96 cells. Viability of RSC96 cells was estimated via cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and proliferation of the cells was assessed by 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay. Migration was estimated via wound healing assay and invasion was evaluated through transwell assay. Western blot was employed to test the expressions of PIGF, protein-38 (p38), and phosphorylated p-38 (p-p38). Ginkgetin (50 or 100 μg/ml) increased the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of RSC96 cells, up-regulated PIGF expression and raised the ratio of p-p38/p38, which were all reversed by PIGF silencing. Ginkgetin promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of Schwann cells via PIGF/p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. Reports have revealed that the peripheral immune system is linked to neuropathology; however, little is known about the contribution of B lymphocytes in AD. For this longitudinal study, 133 participants are included at baseline and second-year follow-up. Also, we analyze B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire data generated from a public dataset of three normal and 10 AD samples and perform BCR repertoire profiling and pairwise sharing analysis. As a result, longitudinal increase in B lymphocytes is associated with increased cerebral amyloid deposition and hyperactivates induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia with loss-of-function for beta-amyloid clearance. Patients with AD share similar class-switched BCR sequences with identical isotypes, despite the high somatic hypermutation rate. Thus, BCR repertoire profiling can lead to the development of individualized immune-based therapeutics and treatment. We provide evidence of both quantitative and qualitative changes in B lymphocytes during AD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
During limb movement, spinal circuits facilitate the alternating activation of antagonistic flexor and extensor muscles. Yet antagonist cocontraction is often required to stabilize joints, like when loads are handled. Previous results suggest that these different muscle activation patterns are mediated by separate flexion- and extension-related motor cortical output populations, while others suggest recruitment of task-specific populations. To distinguish between hypotheses, we developed a paradigm in which mice toggle between forelimb tasks requiring antagonist alternation or cocontraction and measured activity in motor cortical layer 5b. Our results conform to neither hypothesis: consistent flexion- and extension-related activity is not observed across tasks, and no task-specific populations are observed. Instead, activity covariation among motor cortical neurons dramatically changes between tasks, thereby altering the relation between neural and muscle activity. This is also observed specifically for corticospinal neurons. Collectively, our findings indicate that motor cortex drives different muscle activation patterns via task-specific activity covariation.

Abstract: Summary
Context shapes our perception of facial expressions during everyday social interactions. We interpret a person’s face in a hostile situation negatively and judge the same face under pleasant circumstances positively. Critical to our adaptive fitness, context provides situation-specific framing to resolve ambiguity and guide our interpersonal behavior. This context-specific modulation of facial expression is thought to engage the amygdala, hippocampus, and orbitofrontal cortex; however, the underlying neural computations remain unknown. Here we use human intracranial electroencephalograms (EEGs) directly recorded from these regions and report bidirectional theta-gamma interactions within the amygdala-hippocampal network, facilitating contextual processing. Contextual information is subsequently represented in the orbitofrontal cortex, where a theta phase shift binds context and face associations within theta cycles, endowing faces with contextual meanings at behavioral timescales. Our results identify theta phase shifts as mediating associations between context and face processing, supporting flexible social behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Golgi outposts (GOPs) in dendrites are known for their role in promoting branch extension, but whether GOPs have other functions is unclear. We found that terminal branches of Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons actively grow during the early third-instar (E3) larval stage but retract in the late third (L3) stage. Interestingly, the Fringe (Fng) glycosyltransferase localizes increasingly at GOPs in distal dendritic regions through the E3 to the L3 stage. Expression of the endopeptidase Furin 2 (Fur2), which proteolyzes and inactivates Fng, decreases from E3 to L3 in C4da neurons, thereby increasing Fng-positive GOPs in dendrites. The epidermal Delta ligand and neuronal Notch receptor, the substrate for Fng-mediated O-glycosylation, also negatively regulate dendrite growth. Fng inhibits actin dynamics in dendrites, linking dendritic branch retraction to suppression of the C4da-mediated thermal nociception response in late larval stages. Thus, Fng-positive GOPs function in dendrite retraction, which would add another function to the repertoire of GOPs in dendrite arborization.

Abstract: Summary
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating mammary organogenesis and oncogenesis. However, therapeutic methods targeting the Wnt pathway against breast cancer have been limited. To address this challenge, we investigate the function of cyclin-dependent kinase 14 (CDK14), a member of the Wnt signaling pathway, in mammary development and breast cancer progression. We show that CDK14 is expressed in the mammary basal layer and elevated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). CDK14 knockdown reduces the colony-formation ability and regeneration capacity of mammary basal cells and inhibits the progression of murine MMTV-Wnt-1 basal-like mammary tumor. CDK14 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition by FMF-04-159-2 suppresses the progression and metastasis of TNBC. Mechanistically, CDK14 inhibition inhibits mammary regeneration and TNBC progression by attenuating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These findings highlight the significance of CDK14 in mammary development and TNBC progression, shedding light on CDK14 as a promising therapeutic target for TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Due to the recrudescence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections worldwide, mainly caused by the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) and its sub-lineages, several jurisdictions are administering an mRNA vaccine boost. Here, we analyze humoral responses induced after the second and third doses of an mRNA vaccine in naive and previously infected donors who received their second dose with an extended 16-week interval. We observe that the extended interval elicits robust humoral responses against VOCs, but this response is significantly diminished 4 months after the second dose. Administering a boost to these individuals brings back the humoral responses to the same levels obtained after the extended second dose. Interestingly, we observe that administering a boost to individuals that initially received a short 3- to 4-week regimen elicits humoral responses similar to those observed in the long interval regimen. Nevertheless, humoral responses elicited by the boost in naive individuals do not reach those present in previously infected vaccinated individuals.

Abstract: Summary
We identify ADIRF-AS1 circadian long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Deletion of ADIRF-AS1 in U2OS cells alters rhythmicity of clock-controlled genes and expression of extracellular matrix genes. ADIRF-AS1 interacts with all components of the PBAF (PBRM1/BRG1) complex in U2OS cells. Because PBRM1 is a tumor suppressor mutated in over 40% of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) cases, we evaluate ADIRF-AS1 in ccRCC cells. Reducing ADIRF-AS1 expression in ccRCC cells decreases expression of some PBAF-suppressed genes. Expression of these genes is partially rescued by PBRM1 loss, consistent with ADIRF-AS1 acting in part to modulate PBAF. ADIRF-AS1 expression correlates with survival in human ccRCC, particularly in PBRM1 wild-type, but not mutant, tumors. Loss of ADIRF-AS1 eliminates in vivo tumorigenesis, partially rescued by concurrent loss of PBRM1 only when co-injected with Matrigel, suggesting a PBRM1-independent function of ADIRF-AS1. Our findings suggest that ADIRF-AS1 functions partly through PBAF to regulate specific genes as a BMAL1-CLOCK-regulated, oncogenic lncRNA.

Abstract: Summary
The nanoscopic organization and regulation of individual molecular components in presynaptic varicosities of neurons releasing modulatory volume neurotransmitters like dopamine (DA) remain largely elusive. Here we show, by application of several super-resolution microscopy techniques to cultured neurons and mouse striatal slices, that the DA transporter (DAT), a key protein in varicosities of dopaminergic neurons, exists in the membrane in dynamic equilibrium between an inward-facing nanodomain-localized and outward-facing unclustered configuration. The balance between these configurations is inversely regulated by excitatory drive and DA D2 autoreceptor activation in a manner dependent on Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The DAT nanodomains contain tens of transporters molecules and overlap with nanodomains of PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) but show little overlap with D2 autoreceptor, syntaxin-1, and clathrin nanodomains. The data reveal a mechanism for rapid alterations of nanoscopic DAT distribution and show a striking link of this to the conformational state of the transporter.

Abstract: Summary
Sleep spindles are crucial for learning in the cortex and basal ganglia (BG) because they facilitate the reactivation of previously active neuronal ensembles. Studying field potentials (FPs) and spiking in the cortex and BG during sleep in non-human primates following pre-sleep learning, we show that FP sleep spindles are widespread in the BG and are similar to cortical spindles in morphology, spectral content, and response to the pre-sleep task. Further, BG spindles are concordant with electroencephalogram (EEG) spindles and associated with increased cortico-BG correlation. However, spindles across the BG differ markedly in their entrainment of local spiking. The spiking activity of striatal projection neurons exhibits consistent phase locking to striatal and EEG spindles, producing phase windows of peaked cross-region spindling. In contrast, firing in other BG nuclei is not entrained to either local or EEG sleep spindles. These results suggest corticostriatal synapses as the main hub for offline cortico-BG communication.
