Abstract: Summary
CD8 T cells play a key role in defense against the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma, but why certain CD8 responses are more potent than others is not well understood. Here, we describe a parasite antigen, ROP5, that elicits a CD8 T cell response in genetically susceptible mice. ROP5 is secreted via parasite organelles termed rhoptries that are injected directly into host cells during invasion, whereas the protective, dense-granule antigen GRA6 is constitutively secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole. Transgenic parasites in which the ROP5 antigenic epitope was targeted for secretion through dense granules led to enhanced CD8 T cell responses, whereas targeting the GRA6 epitope to rhoptries led to reduced CD8 responses. CD8 T cell responses to the dense-granule-targeted ROP5 epitope resulted in reduced parasite load in the brain. These data suggest that the mode of secretion affects the efficacy of parasite-specific CD8 T cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
Human RecQ4 (hRecQ4) affects cancer and aging but is difficult to study because it is a fusion between a helicase and an essential replication factor. Budding yeast Hrq1 is homologous to the disease-linked helicase domain of RecQ4 and, like hRecQ4, is a robust 3′-5′ helicase. Additionally, Hrq1 has the unusual property of forming heptameric rings. Cells lacking Hrq1 exhibited two DNA damage phenotypes: hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and telomere addition to DNA breaks. Both activities are rare; their coexistence in a single protein is unprecedented. Resistance to ICLs requires helicase activity, but suppression of telomere addition does not. Hrq1 also affects telomere length by a noncatalytic mechanism, as well as telomerase-independent telomere maintenance. Because Hrq1 binds telomeres in vivo, it probably affects them directly. Thus, the tumor-suppressing activity of RecQ4 could be due to a role in ICL repair and/or suppression of de novo telomere addition.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes, small RNAs (sRNAs) have key roles in development, gene expression regulation, and genome integrity maintenance. In ciliates, such as Paramecium, sRNAs form the heart of an epigenetic system that has evolved from core eukaryotic gene silencing components to selectively target DNA for deletion. In Paramecium, somatic genome development from the germline genome accurately eliminates the bulk of typically gene-interrupting, noncoding DNA. We have discovered an sRNA class (internal eliminated sequence [IES] sRNAs [iesRNAs]), arising later during Paramecium development, which originates from and precisely delineates germline DNA (IESs) and complements the initial sRNAs (“scan” RNAs [scnRNAs]) in targeting DNA for elimination. We show that whole-genome duplications have facilitated successive differentiations of Paramecium Dicer-like proteins, leading to cooperation between Dcl2 and Dcl3 to produce scnRNAs and to the production of iesRNAs by Dcl5. These innovations highlight the ability of sRNA systems to acquire capabilities, including those in genome development and integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of cargo transport via adaptor molecules is essential for neuronal development. However, the role of PDZ scaffolding proteins as adaptors in neuronal cargo trafficking is still poorly understood. Here, we show by genetic deletion in mice that the multi-PDZ domain scaffolding protein glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) is required for dendrite development. We identify an interaction between GRIP1 and 14-3-3 proteins that is essential for the function of GRIP1 as an adaptor protein in dendritic cargo transport. Mechanistically, 14-3-3 binds to the kinesin-1 binding region in GRIP1 in a phospho-dependent manner and detaches GRIP1 from the kinesin-1 motor protein complex thereby regulating cargo transport. A single point mutation in the Thr956 of GRIP1 in transgenic mice impairs dendritic development. Together, our results show a regulatory role for GRIP1 during microtubule-based transport and suggest a crucial function for 14-3-3 proteins in controlling kinesin-1 motor attachment during neuronal development.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling networks controlled by Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and the transcription factor Atoh1 regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs). Deregulations in those developmental processes lead to medulloblastoma formation, the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. Although the protein Atoh1 is a key factor during both cerebellar development and medulloblastoma formation, up-to-date detailed mechanisms underlying its function and regulation have remained poorly understood. Here, we report that SHH regulates Atoh1 stability by preventing its phosphodependent degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Huwe1. Our results reveal that SHH and Atoh1 contribute to a positive autoregulatory loop promoting neuronal precursor expansion. Consequently, Huwe1 loss in mouse SHH medulloblastoma illustrates the disruption of this developmental mechanism in cancer. Hence, the crosstalk between SHH signaling and Atoh1 during cerebellar development highlights a collaborative network that could be further targeted in medulloblastoma.

Abstract: Zinc-finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases are novel gene-editing platforms contributing to redefine the boundaries of modern biological research. They are composed of a non-specific cleavage domain and a tailor made DNA-binding module, which enables a broad range of genetic modifications by inducing efficient DNA double-strand breaks at desired loci. Among other remarkable uses, these nucleases have been employed to produce gene knockouts in mid-size and large animals, such as rabbits and pigs, respectively. This approach is cost effective, relatively quick, and can produce invaluable models for human disease studies, biotechnology or agricultural purposes. Here we describe a protocol for the efficient generation of knockout rabbits using transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and a perspective of the field.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) regulates metabolic genes in skeletal muscle and contributes to the response of muscle to exercise. Muscle PGC-1α transgenic expression and exercise both increase the expression of thermogenic genes within white adipose. How the PGC-1α-mediated response to exercise in muscle conveys signals to other tissues remains incompletely defined. We employed a metabolomic approach to examine metabolites secreted from myocytes with forced expression of PGC-1α, and identified β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) as a small molecule myokine. BAIBA increases the expression of brown adipocyte-specific genes in white adipocytes and β-oxidation in hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo through a PPARα-mediated mechanism, induces a brown adipose-like phenotype in human pluripotent stem cells, and improves glucose homeostasis in mice. In humans, plasma BAIBA concentrations are increased with exercise and inversely associated with metabolic risk factors. BAIBA may thus contribute to exercise-induced protection from metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Autogenous bone graft is the gold standard for fusion procedure. However, pain at donor site and inconsistent outcome have left a surgeon to venture into some other technique for spinal fusion. The objective of this study was to determine whether osteogenesis induced bone marrow stem cells with the combination of ceramics granules (HA or TCP/HA), and fibrin could serve as an alternative to generate spinal fusion. The sheep's bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were aspirated form iliac crest and cultured for several passages until confluence. BMSCs were trypsinized and seeded on hydroxyapatite scaffold (HA) and tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite (TCP/HA) for further osteogenic differentiation in the osteogenic medium one week before implantation. Six adult sheep underwent three-level, bilateral, posterolateral intertransverse process fusions at L1–L6. Three fusion sites in each animal were assigned to three treatments: (a) HA constructs group/L1–L2, (b) TCP/HA constructs group/L2–L3, and (c) autogenous bone graft group/L5–L6. The spinal fusion segments were evaluated using radiography, manual palpation, histological analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 12 weeks post implantation. The TCP/HA constructs achieved superior lumbar intertransverse fusion compared to HA construct but autogenous bone graft still produced the best fusion among all.

Abstract: Nitric oxide is a gaseous molecule associated with many distinct physiological functions, and is derived from l-arginine catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Nitric oxide synthase has 3 isoforms: nNOS, iNOS and eNOS. Although these NOS isoforms are believed to play an important role in gingival tissue, little information is available on their morphological dynamics. The aim of this study was to investigate the profiles of NOS isoforms in deficiency of nNOS in gingiva of mice. Twelve male (6 normal (C57BL/6) and 6 nNOS knockout) mice were used. All mice were 5-week-old, weighing approximately 20–25g each. After sacrifice, the jaws of the mice were removed by mechanical means and specimens analyzed by histology, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical observation revealed positive staining for iNOS and eNOS, especially in lamina propria. Similar results in the mRNA expression levels were shown by in situ hybridization analysis. It may suggest that iNOS and eNOS compensated nNOS deficiency in the gingiva of nNOS knockout mice.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial morphology is maintained by the opposing activities of dynamin-based fission and fusion machines. In response to stress, this balance is dramatically shifted toward fission. This study reveals that the yeast transcriptional repressor cyclin C is both necessary and sufficient for stress-induced hyperfission. In response to oxidative stress, cyclin C translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is destroyed. Prior to its destruction, cyclin C both genetically and physically interacts with Mdv1p, an adaptor that links the GTPase Dnm1p to the mitochondrial receptor Fis1p. Cyclin C is required for stress-induced Mdv1p mitochondrial recruitment and the efficient formation of functional Dnm1p filaments. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation studies and fluorescence microscopy revealed an elevated association between Mdv1p and Dnm1p in stressed cells that is dependent on cyclin C. This study provides a mechanism by which stress-induced gene induction and mitochondrial fission are coordinated through translocation of cyclin C.

Abstract: Summary
High tumor burden is associated with increased levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines that influence the pathophysiology of the tumor and its environment. The cellular and molecular events mediating the organismal response to a growing tumor are poorly understood. Here, we report a bidirectional crosstalk between epithelial tumors and the fat body—a peripheral immune tissue—in Drosophila. Tumors trigger a systemic immune response through activation of Eiger/TNF signaling, which leads to Toll pathway upregulation in adipocytes. Reciprocally, Toll elicits a non-tissue-autonomous program in adipocytes, which drives tumor cell death. Hemocytes play a critical role in this system by producing the ligands Spätzle and Eiger, which are required for Toll activation in the fat body and tumor cell death. Altogether, our results provide a paradigm for a long-range tumor suppression function of adipocytes in Drosophila, which may represent an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in the organismal response to solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Cell populations can be strikingly heterogeneous, composed of multiple cellular states, each exhibiting stochastic noise in its gene expression. A major challenge is to disentangle these two types of variability and to understand the dynamic processes and mechanisms that control them. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide an ideal model system to address this issue because they exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic expression of functionally important regulatory factors. We analyzed gene expression in individual ESCs using single-molecule RNA-FISH and quantitative time-lapse movies. These data discriminated stochastic switching between two coherent (correlated) gene expression states and burst-like transcriptional noise. We further showed that the “2i” signaling pathway inhibitors modulate both types of variation. Finally, we found that DNA methylation plays a key role in maintaining these metastable states. Together, these results show how ESC gene expression states and dynamics arise from a combination of intrinsic noise, coherent cellular states, and epigenetic regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations of WD40-repeat protein 62 (WDR62) have been identified recently to cause human MCPH (autosomal-recessive primary microcephaly), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by decreased brain size. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we investigate the function of WDR62 in brain development and the pathological role of WDR62 mutations. We find that WDR62 knockdown leads to premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The defect can be rescued by wild-type human WDR62, but not by the five MCPH-associated WDR62 mutants. We demonstrate that WDR62 acts upstream of JNK signaling in the control of neurogenesis. Depletion of JNK1 and WDR62 incurs very similar defects including abnormal spindle formation and mitotic division of NPCs as well as premature NPC differentiation during cortical development. Thus, our findings indicate that WDR62 is required for proper neurogenesis via JNK1 and provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying MCPH pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) are components of the mammalian core cell-cycle machinery and function to drive cell proliferation. Here, we report that D-cyclins perform a rate-limiting antiapoptotic function in vivo. We found that acute shutdown of all three D-cyclins in bone marrow of adult mice resulted in massive apoptosis of all hematopoietic cell types. We demonstrate that adult hematopoietic stem cells are particularly dependent on D-cyclins for survival and that they are especially sensitive to cyclin D loss. Surprisingly, we found that the antiapoptotic function of D-cyclins also operates in quiescent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Our analyses revealed that D-cyclins repress the expression of the death receptor Fas and its ligand, FasL. Acute ablation of D-cyclins upregulated these proapoptotic genes and led to Fas- and caspase 8-dependent apoptosis. These results reveal an unexpected function of cell-cycle proteins in controlling apoptosis in normal cell homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Aerobic glycolysis (AG; i.e., nonoxidative metabolism of glucose despite the presence of abundant oxygen) accounts for 10%–12% of glucose used by the adult human brain. AG varies regionally in the resting state. Brain AG may support synaptic growth and remodeling; however, data supporting this hypothesis are sparse. Here, we report on investigations on the role of AG in the human brain. Meta-analysis of prior brain glucose and oxygen metabolism studies demonstrates that AG increases during childhood, precisely when synaptic growth rates are highest. In resting adult humans, AG correlates with the persistence of gene expression typical of infancy (transcriptional neoteny). In brain regions with the highest AG, we find increased gene expression related to synapse formation and growth. In contrast, regions high in oxidative glucose metabolism express genes related to mitochondria and synaptic transmission. Our results suggest that brain AG supports developmental processes, particularly those required for synapse formation and growth.

Abstract: Summary
To take full advantage of fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutations, thermal control must be extremely rapid. We developed the Therminator, a device capable of shifting sample temperature in ∼17 s while simultaneously imaging cell division in vivo. Applying this technology to six key regulators of cytokinesis, we found that each has a distinct temporal requirement in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote. Specifically, myosin-II is required throughout cytokinesis until contractile ring closure. In contrast, formin-mediated actin nucleation is only required during assembly and early contractile ring constriction. Centralspindlin is required to maintain division after ring closure, although its GAP activity is only required until just prior to closure. Finally, the chromosomal passenger complex is required for cytokinesis only early in mitosis, but not during metaphase or cytokinesis. Together, our results provide a precise functional timeline for molecular regulators of cytokinesis using the Therminator, a powerful tool for ultra-rapid protein inactivation.

Abstract: Summary
E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b has emerged as a gatekeeper that controls the activation threshold of the T cell antigen receptor and maintains the balance between tolerance and autoimmunity. Here, we report that the loss of Cbl-b facilitates T helper 2 (Th2) and Th9 cell differentiation in vitro. In a mouse model of asthma, the absence of Cbl-b results in severe airway inflammation and stronger Th2 and Th9 responses. Mechanistically, Cbl-b selectively associates with Stat6 upon IL-4 ligation and targets Stat6 for ubiquitination and degradation. These processes are heightened in the presence of T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 costimulation. Furthermore, we identify K108 and K398 as Stat6 ubiquitination sites. Intriguingly, introducing Stat6 deficiency into Cblb−/− mice abrogates hyper-Th2 responses but only partially attenuates Th9 responses. Therefore, our data reveal a function for Cbl-b in the regulation of Th2 and Th9 cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
A large and diverse set of proteins, including CST complex, nonsense mediated decay (NMD), and DNA damage response (DDR) proteins, play important roles at the telomere in mammals and yeast. Here, we report that NMD, like the DDR, affects single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) production at uncapped telomeres. Remarkably, we find that the requirement for Cdc13, one of the components of CST, can be efficiently bypassed when aspects of DDR and NMD pathways are inactivated. However, identical genetic interventions do not bypass the need for Stn1 and Ten1, the partners of Cdc13. We show that disabling NMD alters the stoichiometry of CST components at telomeres and permits Stn1 to bind telomeres in the absence of Cdc13. Our data support a model that Stn1 and Ten1 can function in a Cdc13-independent manner and have implications for the function of CST components across eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
The displacement loop (D loop) is the product of homology search and DNA strand invasion, constituting a central intermediate in homologous recombination (HR). In eukaryotes, the Rad51 DNA strand exchange protein is assisted in D loop formation by the Rad54 motor protein. Curiously, Rad54 also disrupts D loops. How these opposing activities are coordinated toward productive recombination is unknown. Moreover, a seemingly disparate function of Rad54 is removal of Rad51 from heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) to allow HR-associated DNA synthesis. Here, we uncover features of D loop formation/dissociation dynamics, employing Rad51 filaments formed on ssDNAs that mimic the physiological length and structure of in vivo substrates. The Rad54 motor is activated by Rad51 bound to synapsed DNAs and guided by a ssDNA-binding domain. We present a unified model wherein Rad54 acts as an hDNA pump that drives D loop formation while simultaneously removing Rad51 from hDNA, consolidating both ATP-dependent activities of Rad54 into a single mechanistic step.

Abstract: Summary
Class switch recombination (CSR) is a B cell-specific genomic alteration induced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent DNA break at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, followed by repair. Although chromatin-associated factors in promoting AID-induced DNA break have been widely reported, the involvement of chromatin adaptors at the repair phase of CSR remains unknown. Here, we show that the acetylated histone reader Brd4 is critical for nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair of AID- and I-SceI-induced DNA breaks. Brd4 was recruited to the DNA break regions, and its depletion from the chromatin caused CSR impairment without affecting the DNA break generation. Inhibition of Brd4 suppressed the accumulation of 53BP1 and uracil DNA glycosylase at the switch regions, perturbed the switch junctional microhomology, and reduced Igh/c-myc translocation. We conclude that Brd4 serves as a chromatin platform required for the recruitment of repair components during CSR and general DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated hepatic synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides, driven by hyperactivation of the SREBP-1c transcription factor, has been implicated as a causal feature of metabolic syndrome. SREBP-1c activation requires the proteolytic maturation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-bound precursor to the active, nuclear transcription factor, which is stimulated by feeding and insulin signaling. Here, we show that feeding and insulin stimulate the hepatic expression of PASK. We also demonstrate, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, that PASK is required for the proteolytic maturation of SREBP-1c in cultured cells and in the mouse and rat liver. Inhibition of PASK improves lipid and glucose metabolism in dietary animal models of obesity and dyslipidemia. Administration of a PASK inhibitor decreases hepatic expression of lipogenic SREBP-1c target genes, decreases serum triglycerides, and partially reverses insulin resistance. While the signaling network that controls SREBP-1c activation is complex, we propose that PASK is an important component with therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA binding proteins Rbfox1/2/3 regulate alternative splicing in the nervous system, and disruption of Rbfox1 has been implicated in autism. However, comprehensive identification of functional Rbfox targets has been challenging. Here, we perform HITS-CLIP for all three Rbfox family members in order to globally map, at a single-nucleotide resolution, their in vivo RNA interaction sites in the mouse brain. We find that the two guanines in the Rbfox binding motif UGCAUG are critical for protein-RNA interactions and crosslinking. Using integrative modeling, these interaction sites, combined with additional datasets, define 1,059 direct Rbfox target alternative splicing events. Over half of the quantifiable targets show dynamic changes during brain development. Of particular interest are 111 events from 48 candidate autism-susceptibility genes, including syndromic autism genes Shank3, Cacna1c, and Tsc2. Alteration of Rbfox targets in some autistic brains is correlated with downregulation of all three Rbfox proteins, supporting the potential clinical relevance of the splicing-regulatory network.

Abstract: Summary
During the cell cycle, DNA duplication in S phase must occur before a cell divides in mitosis. In the intervening G2 phase, mitotic inducers accumulate, which eventually leads to a switch-like rise in mitotic kinase activity that triggers mitotic entry. However, when and how activation of the signaling network that promotes the transition to mitosis occurs remains unclear. We have developed a system to reduce cell-cell variation and increase accuracy of fluorescence quantification in single cells. This allows us to use immunofluorescence of endogenous marker proteins to assess kinetics from fixed cells. We find that mitotic phosphorylations initially occur at the completion of S phase, showing that activation of the mitotic entry network does not depend on protein accumulation through G2. Our data show insights into how mitotic entry is linked to the completion of S phase and forms a quantitative resource for mathematical models of the human cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-propagating cells in acute leukemia maintain a stem/progenitor-like immature phenotype and proliferative capacity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) originate from different lineages through distinct oncogenic events such as MLL fusions and Notch signaling, respectively. We found that Zfx, a transcription factor that controls hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, controls the initiation and maintenance of AML caused by MLL-AF9 fusion and of T-ALL caused by Notch1 activation. In both leukemia types, Zfx prevents differentiation and activates gene sets characteristic of immature cells of the respective lineages. In addition, endogenous Zfx contributes to gene induction and transformation by Myc overexpression in myeloid progenitors. Key Zfx target genes include the mitochondrial enzymes Ptpmt1 and Idh2, whose overexpression partially rescues the propagation of Zfx-deficient AML. These results show that distinct leukemia types maintain their undifferentiated phenotype and self-renewal by exploiting a common stem-cell-related genetic regulator.

Abstract: The structure of the kidney and the localization of Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) immunopositive cells were examined throughout the postembryonic development of the Persian sturgeon, Acipenser persicus, from newly hatched prelarvae (10mm) to 20 days post hatch (20 DPH) larvae (31mm). Investigations were conducted through histology and immunohistochemistry by using the light and immunofluorescence microscopy. The pronephros was observed in newly hatched prelarvae. The cells lining the distal pronephric tubules and their collecting ducts showed laterally expressed NKA immunofluorescence that later extended throughout the whole cytoplasm. Mesonephrogenous placodes and pre-glomeruli were distinguished at 2 DPH along the collecting ducts posteriorly. Their tubules were formed and present in kidney mesenchyma, differentiated into neck, proximal, distal and collecting segments at 7 DPH when NKA immunopositive cells were observed. Their distal and collecting tubules showed an increasing immunofluorescence throughout their cytoplasm while the glomeruli remained unstained. From D 9 to D 17, the epithelial layer of pronephric collecting duct changed along the mesonephros to form ureters. Ureters, possessing isolated strong NKA immunopositive cells, appeared as two sac-like structures hanging under the trunk kidney. Since NKA immunopositive cells were not observed on the tegument or along the digestive tract of newly hatched prelarva, and also the gills are not formed yet, the pronephros is the only osmoregulatory organ until 4 DPH. At the larval stage, the pronephros and mesonephros are functional osmoregulatory organs and actively reabsorb necessary ions from the filtrate.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation is a dynamic and reversible process that governs gene expression during development and disease. Several examples of active DNA demethylation have been documented, involving genome-wide and gene-specific DNA demethylation. How demethylating enzymes are targeted to specific genomic loci remains largely unknown. We show that an antisense lncRNA, termed TARID (for TCF21 antisense RNA inducing demethylation), activates TCF21 expression by inducing promoter demethylation. TARID interacts with both the TCF21 promoter and GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, alpha), a regulator of DNA demethylation. GADD45A in turn recruits thymine-DNA glycosylase for base excision repair-mediated demethylation involving oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the TCF21 promoter by ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase proteins. The results reveal a function of lncRNAs, serving as a genomic address label for GADD45A-mediated demethylation of specific target genes.

Gain-of-Function Mutant p53 Promotes Cell Growth and Cancer Cell Metabolism via Inhibition of AMPK Activation,

Abstract: Summary
Many mutant p53 proteins (mutp53s) exert oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) properties, but the mechanisms mediating these functions remain poorly defined. We show here that GOF mutp53s inhibit AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in head and neck cancer cells. Conversely, downregulation of GOF mutp53s enhances AMPK activation under energy stress, decreasing the activity of the anabolic factors acetyl-CoA carboxylase and ribosomal protein S6 and inhibiting aerobic glycolytic potential and invasive cell growth. Under conditions of energy stress, GOF mutp53s, but not wild-type p53, preferentially bind to the AMPKα subunit and inhibit AMPK activation. Given the importance of AMPK as an energy sensor and tumor suppressor that inhibits anabolic metabolism, our findings reveal that direct inhibition of AMPK activation is an important mechanism through which mutp53s can gain oncogenic function.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of cellular energy expenditure is fundamental to normal and pathological cell growth and differentiation. Mitochondria stores energy as a proton gradient across their inner membrane. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) can dissipate the gradient to produce heat or regulate metabolite fluxes. UCP-mediated proton currents require fatty acids (FAs) and are blocked by nucleotides, but the molecular basis of these processes is unknown. We find, by nuclear magnetic resonance and functional mutagenesis, that UCP2 can bind FAs laterally through its peripheral site, and this intramembrane molecular recognition is essential for UCP2-catalyzed FA flipping across the membrane, which in turn is essential for proton translocation. The antagonist GDP binds inside the UCP2 cavity and perturbs its conformation, which can displace FA from the peripheral site as a mean of inhibiting proton currents. Our data provide a biophysical perspective of the intricate interplay of UCPs, FA, and nucleotides in determining proton fluxes in mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) occupies a central place in cellular energy production, linking the tricarboxylic cycle with the electron transport chain. As a result, a subset of cancers and neuromuscular disorders result from mutations affecting any of the four SDH structural subunits or either of two known SDH assembly factors. Herein we characterize an evolutionarily conserved SDH assembly factor designated Sdh8/SDHAF4, using yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells. Sdh8 interacts specifically with the catalytic Sdh1 subunit in the mitochondrial matrix, facilitating its association with Sdh2 and the subsequent assembly of the SDH holocomplex. These roles for Sdh8 are critical for preventing motility defects and neurodegeneration in Drosophila as well as the excess ROS generated by free Sdh1. These studies provide insights into the mechanisms by which SDH is assembled and raise the possibility that some forms of neuromuscular disease may be associated with mutations that affect this SDH assembly factor.

Abstract: Summary
The chemokine receptor CCR7 plays a crucial role in the homing of central memory and naive T cells to peripheral lymphoid organs. Here, we show that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu downregulates CCR7 on the surface of CD4+ T cells. Vpu and CCR7 were found to specifically interact and colocalize within the trans-Golgi network, where CCR7 is retained. Downmodulation of CCR7 did not involve degradation or endocytosis and was strictly dependent on Vpu expression. Stimulation of HIV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells with the CCR7 ligand CCL19 resulted in reduced mobilization of Ca2+, reduced phosphorylation of Erk1/2, and impaired migration toward CCL19. Specific amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain of Vpu that were previously shown to be critical for BST-2 downmodulation (A14, A18, and W22) were also necessary for CCR7 downregulation. These results suggest that BST-2 and CCR7 may be downregulated via similar mechanisms.

Abstract: There is well-established variability in the numbers of lipid bodies (LB) in macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Similarly to the steatosis observed in adipocytes and hepatocytes during hyperinsulinemia and nutrient overload, immune cell LB hyper-accumulate in response to bacterial and parasitic infection and inflammatory presentations. Recently we described that hyperinsulinemia, both in vitro and in vivo, drives steatosis and phenotypic changes in primary and transformed mast cells and basophils. LB reach high numbers in these steatotic cytosols, and here we propose that they could dramatically impact the transcytoplasmic signaling pathways. We compared calcium release and influx responses at the population and single cell level in normal and steatotic model mast cells. At the population level, all aspects of FcɛRI-dependent calcium mobilization, as well as activation of calcium-dependent downstream signaling targets such as NFATC1 phosphorylation are suppressed. At the single cell level, we demonstrate that LB are both sources and sinks of calcium following FcɛRI cross-linking. Unbiased analysis of the impact of the presence of LB on the rate of trans-cytoplasmic calcium signals suggest that LB enrichment accelerates calcium propagation, which may reflect a Bernoulli effect. LB abundance thus impacts this fundamental signaling pathway and its downstream targets.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been implicated in human neurological diseases such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), neurodegeneration, and autism. However, little is known about when and how mTOR is involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases, due to a lack of animal models that directly increase mTOR activity. Here, we generated transgenic mice expressing a gain-of-function mutant of mTOR in the forebrain in a temporally controlled manner. Selective activation of mTORC1 in embryonic stages induced cortical atrophy caused by prominent apoptosis of neuronal progenitors, associated with upregulation of HIF-1α. In striking contrast, activation of the mTORC1 pathway in adulthood resulted in cortical hypertrophy with fatal epileptic seizures, recapitulating human TSC. Activated mTORC1 in the adult cortex also promoted rapid accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions and activation of microglial cells, indicative of progressive neurodegeneration. Our findings demonstrate that mTORC1 plays different roles in developmental and adult stages and contributes to human neurological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA represents a major mechanism underlying increased transcriptome and proteome complexity. Here, we show that the nuclear speckle RNA-binding protein (NSR) and the AS competitor long noncoding RNA (or ASCO-lncRNA) constitute an AS regulatory module. AtNSR-GFP translational fusions are expressed in primary and lateral root (LR) meristems. Double Atnsr mutants and ASCO overexpressors exhibit an altered ability to form LRs after auxin treatment. Interestingly, auxin induces a major change in AS patterns of many genes, a response largely dependent on NSRs. RNA immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that AtNSRs interact not only with their alternatively spliced mRNA targets but also with the ASCO-RNA in vivo. The ASCO-RNA displaces an AS target from an NSR-containing complex in vitro. Expression of ASCO-RNA in Arabidopsis affects the splicing patterns of several NSR-regulated mRNA targets. Hence, lncRNA can hijack nuclear AS regulators to modulate AS patterns during development.

Abstract: Summary
Short dysfunctional telomeres are capable of fusion, generating dicentric chromosomes and initiating breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Cells that escape the ensuing cellular crisis exhibit large-scale genomic rearrangements that drive clonal evolution and malignant progression. We demonstrate that there is an absolute requirement for fully functional DNA ligase III (LIG3), but not ligase IV (LIG4), to facilitate the escape from a telomere-driven crisis. LIG3- and LIG4-dependent alternative (A) and classical (C) nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways were capable of mediating the fusion of short dysfunctional telomeres, both displaying characteristic patterns of microhomology and deletion. Cells that failed to escape crisis exhibited increased proportions of C-NHEJ-mediated interchromosomal fusions, whereas those that escaped displayed increased proportions of intrachromosomal fusions. We propose that the balance between inter- and intrachromosomal telomere fusions dictates the ability of human cells to escape crisis and is influenced by the relative activities of A- and C-NHEJ at short dysfunctional telomeres.

Abstract: Summary
The melanocortin system regulates metabolic homeostasis and inflammation. Melanocortin agonists have contradictorily been reported to both increase and decrease metabolic rate and body temperature. We find two distinct physiologic responses occurring at similar doses. Intraperitoneal administration of the nonselective melanocortin agonist MTII causes a melanocortin-4 receptor (Mc4r)-mediated hypermetabolism/hyperthermia. This is preceded by a profound, transient hypometabolism/hypothermia that is preserved in mice lacking any one of Mc1r, Mc3r, Mc4r, or Mc5r. Three other melanocortin agonists also caused hypothermia, which is actively achieved via seeking a cool environment, vasodilation, and inhibition of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. These results suggest that the hypometabolic/hypothermic effect of MTII is not due to a failure of thermoregulation. The hypometabolism/hypothermia was prevented by dopamine antagonists, and MTII selectively activated arcuate nucleus dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that these neurons may contribute to the hypometabolism/hypothermia. We propose that the hypometabolism/hypothermia is a regulated response, potentially beneficial during extreme physiologic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells in the adult brain exist primarily in a quiescent state but are reactivated in response to changing physiological conditions. How do stem cells sense and respond to metabolic changes? In the Drosophila CNS, quiescent neural stem cells are reactivated synchronously in response to a nutritional stimulus. Feeding triggers insulin production by blood-brain barrier glial cells, activating the insulin/insulin-like growth factor pathway in underlying neural stem cells and stimulating their growth and proliferation. Here we show that gap junctions in the blood-brain barrier glia mediate the influence of metabolic changes on stem cell behavior, enabling glia to respond to nutritional signals and reactivate quiescent stem cells. We propose that gap junctions in the blood-brain barrier are required to translate metabolic signals into synchronized calcium pulses and insulin secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based cell therapies have great potential for regenerative medicine but are also potentially associated with tumorigenic risks. Current rodent models are not optimal predictors of efficiency and safety for clinical application. Therefore, we developed a clinically relevant nonhuman primate model to assess the tumorigenic potential and in vivo efficacy of both undifferentiated and differentiated iPSCs in autologous settings without immunosuppression. Undifferentiated autologous iPSCs indeed form mature teratomas in a dose-dependent manner. However, tumor formation is accompanied by an inflammatory reaction. On the other hand, iPSC-derived mesodermal stromal-like cells form new bone in vivo without any evidence of teratoma formation. We therefore show in a large animal model that closely resembles human physiology that undifferentiated autologous iPSCs form teratomas, and that iPSC-derived progenitor cells can give rise to a functional tissue in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8 genes are mutated in a mutually exclusive manner in 3M and other growth retardation syndromes. The mechanism underlying the function of the three 3M genes in development is not known. We found that OBSL1 and CCDC8 form a complex with CUL7 and regulate the level and centrosomal localization of CUL7, respectively. CUL7 depletion results in altered microtubule dynamics, prometaphase arrest, tetraploidy, and mitotic cell death. These defects are recaptured in CUL7 mutated 3M cells and can be rescued by wild-type, but not by 3M patient-derived CUL7 mutants. Depletion of either OBSL1 or CCDC8 results in defects and sensitizes cells to microtubule damage similarly to loss of CUL7 function. Microtubule damage reduces the level of CCDC8 that is required for the centrosomal localization of CUL7. We propose that CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8 proteins form a 3M complex that functions in maintaining microtubule and genome integrity and normal development.

Abstract: Summary
Silencing of MLH1 is frequently seen in sporadic colorectal cancers. We show here that hypoxia causes decreased histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation at the MLH1 promoter via the action of the H3K4 demethylases LSD1 and PLU-1 and promotes durable long-term silencing in a pathway that requires LSD1. Knockdown of LSD1 or its corepressor, CoREST, also prevents the resilencing (and associated cytosine DNA methylation) of the endogenous MLH1 promoter in RKO colon cancer cells following transient reactivation by treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). The results demonstrate that hypoxia is a driving force for silencing of MLH1 and that the LSD1/CoREST complex is necessary for this process. The results reveal a mechanism by which hypoxia promotes cancer cell evolution to drive malignant progression through epigenetic modulation. Our findings suggest that LSD1/CoREST acts as a colon cancer oncogene by epigenetically silencing MLH1 and also identify the LSD1/CoREST complex as a potential target for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to 30% of the adult population in Western societies, yet the underlying molecular pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the dimeric Activator Protein 1 as a regulator of NAFLD. Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1) and Fos-related antigen 2 (Fra-2) prevent dietary NAFLD by inhibiting prosteatotic PPARγ signaling. Moreover, established NAFLD and the associated liver damage can be efficiently reversed by hepatocyte-specific Fra-1 expression. In contrast, c-Fos promotes PPARγ expression, while c-Jun exerts opposing, dimer-dependent functions. Interestingly, JunD was found to be essential for PPARγ signaling and NAFLD development. This unique antagonistic regulation of PPARγ by distinct AP-1 dimers occurs at the transcriptional level and establishes AP-1 as a link between obesity, hepatic lipid metabolism, and NAFLD.

Abstract: Little is known about how hypercholesterolaemia affects Ca2+ signalling in the vasculature of ApoE−/− mice, a model of atherosclerosis. Our objectives were therefore to determine (i) if hypercholesterolaemia alters Ca2+ signalling in aortic endothelial cells before overt atherosclerotic lesions occur, (ii) how Ca2+ signals are affected in older plaque-containing mice, and (iii) whether Ca2+ signalling changes were translated into contractility differences. Using confocal microscopy we found agonist-specific Ca2+ changes in endothelial cells. ATP responses were unchanged in ApoE−/− cells and methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which lowers cholesterol, was without effect. In contrast, Ca2+ signals to carbachol were significantly increased in ApoE−/− cells, an effect methyl-β-cyclodextrin reversed. Ca2+ signals were more oscillatory and store-operated Ca2+ entry decreased as mice aged and plaques formed. Despite clearly increased Ca2+ signals, aortic rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine had impaired relaxation to carbachol. This functional deficit increased with age, was not related to ROS generation, and could be partially rescued by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. In conclusion, carbachol-induced calcium signalling and handling are significantly altered in endothelial cells of ApoE−/− mice before plaque development. We speculate that reduction in store-operated Ca2+ entry may result in less efficient activation of eNOS and thus explain the reduced relaxatory response to CCh, despite the enhanced Ca2+ response.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-cycle phase is a critical determinant of the choice between DNA damage repair by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). Here, we report that double-strand breaks (DSBs) induce ATM-dependent MOF (a histone H4 acetyl-transferase) phosphorylation (p-T392-MOF) and that phosphorylated MOF colocalizes with γ-H2AX, ATM, and 53BP1 foci. Mutation of the phosphorylation site (MOF-T392A) impedes DNA repair in S and G2 phase but not G1 phase cells. Expression of MOF-T392A also blocks the reduction in DSB-associated 53BP1 seen in wild-type S/G2 phase cells, resulting in enhanced 53BP1 and reduced BRCA1 association. Decreased BRCA1 levels at DSB sites correlates with defective repairosome formation, reduced HR repair, and decreased cell survival following irradiation. These data support a model whereby ATM-mediated MOF-T392 phosphorylation modulates 53BP1 function to facilitate the subsequent recruitment of HR repair proteins, uncovering a regulatory role for MOF in DSB repair pathway choice during S/G2 phase.

Abstract: Summary
As cells enter mitosis, the two centrosomes separate and grow dramatically, each forming a nascent spindle pole that nucleates a radial array of microtubules. Centrosome growth (and associated microtubule nucleation surge), termed maturation, involves the recruitment of pericentriolar material components via an as-yet unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Cep192 binds Aurora A and Plk1, targets them to centrosomes in a pericentrin-dependent manner, and promotes sequential activation of both kinases via T-loop phosphorylation. The Cep192-bound Plk1 then phosphorylates Cep192 at several residues to generate the attachment sites for the γ-tubulin ring complex and, possibly, other pericentriolar material components, thus promoting their recruitment and subsequent microtubule nucleation. We further found that the Cep192-dependent Aurora A-Plk1 activity is essential for kinesin-5-mediated centrosome separation, bipolar spindle formation, and equal centrosome/centriole segregation into daughter cells. Thus, our study identifies a Cep192-organized signaling cascade that underlies both centrosome maturation and bipolar spindle assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Modulating chromatin through histone methylation orchestrates numerous cellular processes. SETD2-dependent trimethylation of histone H3K36 is associated with active transcription. Here, we define a role for H3K36 trimethylation in homologous recombination (HR) repair in human cells. We find that depleting SETD2 generates a mutation signature resembling RAD51 depletion at I-SceI-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites, with significantly increased deletions arising through microhomology-mediated end-joining. We establish a presynaptic role for SETD2 methyltransferase in HR, where it facilitates the recruitment of C-terminal binding protein interacting protein (CtIP) and promotes DSB resection, allowing Replication Protein A (RPA) and RAD51 binding to DNA damage sites. Furthermore, reducing H3K36me3 levels by overexpressing KDM4A/JMJD2A, an oncogene and H3K36me3/2 demethylase, or an H3.3K36M transgene also reduces HR repair events. We propose that error-free HR repair within H3K36me3-decorated transcriptionally active genomic regions promotes cell homeostasis. Moreover, these findings provide insights as to why oncogenic mutations cluster within the H3K36me3 axis.

Dachsous-Dependent Asymmetric Localization of Spiny-Legs Determines Planar Cell Polarity Orientation in Drosophila,

Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila, planar cell polarity (PCP) molecules such as Dachsous (Ds) may function as global directional cues directing the asymmetrical localization of PCP core proteins such as Frizzled (Fz). However, the relationship between Ds asymmetry and Fz localization in the eye is opposite to that in the wing, thereby causing controversy regarding how these two systems are connected. Here, we show that this relationship is determined by the ratio of two Prickle (Pk) isoforms, Pk and Spiny-legs (Sple). Pk and Sple form different complexes with distinct subcellular localizations. When the amount of Sple is increased in the wing, Sple induces a reversal of PCP using the Ds-Ft system. A mathematical model demonstrates that Sple is the key regulator connecting Ds and the core proteins. Our model explains the previously noted discrepancies in terms of the differing relative amounts of Sple in the eye and wing.

Abstract: Summary
Ideal strategies to ameliorate CNS damage should promote both neuronal survival and axon regeneration. The receptor Neogenin promotes neuronal apoptosis. Its ligand prevents death, but the resulting repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa)-Neogenin interaction also inhibits axonal growth, countering any prosurvival benefits. Here, we explore strategies to inhibit Neogenin, thus simultaneously enhancing survival and regeneration. We show that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and RGMa-dependent recruitment of Neogenin into lipid rafts requires an interaction between RGMa and Neogenin subdomains. RGMa or Neogenin peptides that prevent this interaction, BMP inhibition by Noggin, or reduction of membrane cholesterol all block Neogenin raft localization, promote axon outgrowth, and prevent neuronal apoptosis. Blocking Neogenin raft association influences axonal pathfinding, enhances survival in the developing CNS, and promotes survival and regeneration in the injured adult optic nerve and spinal cord. Moreover, lowering cholesterol disrupts rafts and restores locomotor function after spinal cord injury. These data reveal a unified strategy to promote both survival and regeneration in the CNS.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms dictating whether a cell proliferates or differentiates have undergone intense scrutiny, but they remain poorly understood. Here, we report that UPF1, a central component in the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, plays a key role in this decision by promoting the proliferative, undifferentiated cell state. UPF1 acts, in part, by destabilizing the NMD substrate encoding the TGF-β inhibitor SMAD7 and stimulating TGF-β signaling. UPF1 also promotes the decay of mRNAs encoding many other proteins that oppose the proliferative, undifferentiated cell state. Neural differentiation is triggered when NMD is downregulated by neurally expressed microRNAs (miRNAs). This UPF1-miRNA circuitry is highly conserved and harbors negative feedback loops that act as a molecular switch. Our results suggest that the NMD pathway collaborates with the TGF-β signaling pathway to lock in the stem-like state, a cellular state that is stably reversed when neural differentiation signals that induce NMD-repressive miRNAs are received.

Abstract: Summary
Although regulators of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway are widely expressed in vertebrate nervous systems, their roles at synapses are unknown. Here, we show that Vangl2 is a postsynaptic factor crucial for synaptogenesis and that it coprecipitates with N-cadherin and PSD-95 from synapse-rich brain extracts. Vangl2 directly binds N-cadherin and enhances its internalization in a Rab5-dependent manner. This physical and functional interaction is suppressed by β-catenin, which binds the same intracellular region of N-cadherin as Vangl2. In hippocampal neurons expressing reduced Vangl2 levels, dendritic spine formation as well as synaptic marker clustering is significantly impaired. Furthermore, Prickle2, another postsynaptic PCP component, inhibits the N-cadherin-Vangl2 interaction and is required for normal spine formation. These results demonstrate direct control of classic cadherin by PCP factors; this control may play a central role in the precise formation and maturation of cell-cell adhesions at the synapse.

Abstract: Summary
White adipose tissue (WAT) morphology characterized by hypertrophy (i.e., fewer but larger adipocytes) associates with increased adipose inflammation, lipolysis, insulin resistance, and risk of diabetes. However, the causal relationships and the mechanisms controlling WAT morphology are unclear. Herein, we identified EBF1 as an adipocyte-expressed transcription factor with decreased expression/activity in WAT hypertrophy. In human adipocytes, the regulatory targets of EBF1 were enriched for genes controlling lipolysis and adipocyte morphology/differentiation, and in both humans and murine models, reduced EBF1 levels associated with increased lipolysis and adipose hypertrophy. Although EBF1 did not affect adipose inflammation, TNFα reduced EBF1 gene expression. High-fat diet intervention in Ebf1+/− mice resulted in more pronounced WAT hypertrophy and attenuated insulin sensitivity compared with wild-type littermate controls. We conclude that EBF1 is an important regulator of adipose morphology and fat cell lipolysis and may constitute a link between WAT inflammation, altered lipid metabolism, adipose hypertrophy, and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Extensive chromatin reprogramming occurs at fertilization and is thought to be under the control of maternal factors, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We report that maternal Hira, a chaperone for the histone variant H3.3, is required for mouse development past the zygote stage. Male pronucleus formation is inhibited upon deletion of Hira due to a lack of nucleosome assembly in the sperm genome. Hira mutant oocytes are incapable of developing parthenogenetically, indicative of a role for Hira in the female genome. Both parental genomes show highly reduced levels of DNA replication and transcription in the mutants. It has long been thought that transcription is not required for zygote development. Surprisingly, we found that Hira/H3.3-dependent transcription of ribosomal RNA is required for first cleavage. Our results demonstrate that Hira-mediated H3.3 incorporation is essential for parental genome reprogramming and reveal an unexpected role for rRNA transcription in the mouse zygote.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical flows mediate anteroposterior polarization in Caenorhabditis elegans by generating two mutually exclusive membrane domains. However, factors downstream of anteroposterior polarity that establish the dorsoventral axis remain elusive. Here, we show that rotational cortical flow orthogonal to the anteroposterior axis during the division of the AB blastomere in the two-cell embryo positions the cytokinetic midbody remnant of the previous division asymmetrically at the future ventral side of the embryo. In the neighboring P1 blastomere, astral microtubules contact a transient PAR-2-dependent actin coat that forms asymmetrically onto the midbody remnant-P1 interface. Ablation of the midbody remnant or perturbation of rotational cortical flow reveals that microtubule-midbody remnant contacts are crucial for P1 spindle rotation and dorsoventral axis formation. Thus, our findings suggest a mechanism for dorsoventral patterning that relies on coupling of anteroposterior polarity, rotational cortical flow, midbody remnant positioning, and spindle orientation.

Abstract: Summary
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a deadly disease for which current treatments are inadequate. We demonstrate that biallelic inactivation of Lkb1 and Pten in the mouse lung leads to SCC that recapitulates the histology, gene expression, and microenvironment found in human disease. Lkb1;Pten null (LP) tumors expressed the squamous markers KRT5, p63 and SOX2, and transcriptionally resembled the basal subtype of human SCC. In contrast to mouse adenocarcinomas, the LP tumors contained immune populations enriched for tumor-associated neutrophils. SCA1+NGFR+ fractions were enriched for tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) that could serially transplant the disease in orthotopic assays. TPCs in the LP model and NGFR+ cells in human SCCs highly expressed Pd-ligand-1 (PD-L1), suggesting a mechanism of immune escape for TPCs.

Abstract: Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) causes various biological effects through altering intracellular calcium homeostasis. The role of high voltage-gated (HVA) calcium channels in ELF-EMF induced effects has been extensively studied. However, the effect of ELF-EMF on low-voltage-gated (LVA) T-type calcium channels has not been reported. In this study, we test the effect of ELF-EMF (50Hz) on human T-type calcium channels transfected in HEK293 cells. Conversely to its stimulant effects on HVA channels, ELF-EMF exposure inhibited all T-type (Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Cav3.3) channels. Neither the protein expression nor the steady-state activation and inactivation kinetics of Cav3.2 channels were altered by ELF-EMF (50Hz, 0.2mT) exposure. Exposure to ELF-EMF increased both arachidonic acid (AA) and leukotriene E4 (LTE4) levels in HEK293 cells. CAY10502 and bestatin, which block the increase of AA and LTE4 respectively, abrogated the ELF-EMF inhibitory effect on Cav3.2 channels. Exogenous LTE4 mimicked the ELF-EMF inhibition of T-type calcium channels. ELF-EMF (50Hz) inhibits native T-type calcium channels in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons via LTE4. We conclude that 50Hz ELF-EMF inhibits T-type calcium channels through AA/LTE4 signaling pathway.

Abstract: A glycosyltransferase, YjiC, from Bacillus licheniformis has been used for the modification of the commercially available isoflavonoids genistein, daidzein, biochanin A and formononetin. The in vitro glycosylation reaction, using UDP-α-D-glucose as a donor for the glucose moiety and aforementioned four acceptor molecules, showed the prominent glycosylation at 4′ and 7 hydroxyl groups, but not at the 5th hydroxyl group of the A-ring, resulting in the production of genistein 4′-O-β-D-glucoside, genistein 7-O-β-D-glucoside (genistin), genistein 4′,7-O-β-D-diglucoside, biochanin A-7-O-β-D-glucoside (sissotrin), daidzein 4′-O-β-D-glucoside, daidzein 7-O-β-D-glucoside (daidzin), daidzein 4′, 7-O-β-D-diglucoside, and formononetin 7-O-β-D-glucoside (ononin). The structures of all the products were elucidated using high performance liquid chromatography-photo diode array and high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR QTOFESI/MS) analysis, and were compared with commercially available standard compounds. Significantly higher bioconversion rates of all four isoflavonoids was observed in both in vitro as well as in vivo bioconversion reactions. The in vivo fermentation of the isoflavonoids by applying engineered E. coli BL21(DE3)/ΔpgiΔzwfΔushA overexpressing phosphoglucomutase (pgm) and glucose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase (galU), along with YjiC, found more than 60% average conversion of 200 μM of supplemented isoflavonoids, without any additional UDP-α-D-glucose added in fermentation medium, which could be very beneficial to large scale industrial production of isoflavonoid glucosides.

Abstract: Endocannabinoid anandamide (N-arachidonoyl ethanolamide; AEA) has been shown to cause negative inotropic and antiarrhythmic effects in ventricular myocytes. In this study, using whole-cell patch clamp technique, we have investigated the effects of AEA on cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1)-mediated currents. AEA suppressed NCX1 with an IC50 value of 4.7μM. Both inward and outward components of exchanger currents were suppressed by AEA equally. AEA inhibition was mimicked by the metabolically stable analogue, methanandamide (metAEA, 10μM) while it was not influenced by inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase with 1μM URB597 incubation. The effect of AEA, was not altered in the presence of cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 antagonists AM251 (1μM) and AM630 (1μM), respectively. In addition, inhibition by AEA remained unchanged after pertussis toxin (PTX, 2μg/ml) treatment or following the inclusion of GDP-β-S (1mM) in pipette solution. Currents mediated by NCX1 expressed in HEK-293cells were also inhibited by 10μM AEA a partially reversible manner. Confocal microscopy images indicated that the intensity of YFP-NCX1 expression on cell surface was not altered by AEA. Collectively, the results indicate that AEA directly inhibits the function of NCX1 in rat ventricular myocytes and in HEK-293cells expressing NCX1.

Abstract: Summary
Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a soluble ligand overexpressed by neoplastic cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), drives formation of a fibroblast-rich desmoplastic stroma. To better understand its role in malignant progression, we deleted Shh in a well-defined mouse model of PDAC. As predicted, Shh-deficient tumors had reduced stromal content. Surprisingly, such tumors were more aggressive and exhibited undifferentiated histology, increased vascularity, and heightened proliferation—features that were fully recapitulated in control mice treated with a Smoothened inhibitor. Furthermore, administration of VEGFR blocking antibody selectively improved survival of Shh-deficient tumors, indicating that Hedgehog-driven stroma suppresses tumor growth in part by restraining tumor angiogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that some components of the tumor stroma can act to restrain tumor growth.

Abstract: Chronic pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk of morbidity/mortality, largely due to maladaptive remodeling and dilatation that progresses to dilated cardiomyopathy. Alternative splicing is an important biological mechanism that generates proteomic complexity and diversity. The recent development of next-generation RNA sequencing has improved our understanding of the qualitative signatures associated with alternative splicing in various biological conditions. However, the role of alternative splicing in cardiac hypertrophy is yet unknown. The present study employed RNA-Seq and a bioinformatic approach to detect the RNA splicing regulatory elements involved in alternative splicing during pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy. We found GC-rich exonic motifs that regulate intron retention in 5′ UTRs and AT-rich exonic motifs that are involved in exclusion of the AT-rich elements that cause mRNA instability in 3′ UTRs. We also identified motifs in the intronic regions involved in exon exclusion and inclusion, which predicted splicing factors that bind to these motifs. We found, through Western blotting, that the expression levels of three splicing factors, ESRP1, PTB and SF2/ASF, were significantly altered during cardiac hypertrophy. Collectively, the present results suggest that chronic pressure-overload hypertrophy is closely associated with distinct alternative splicing due to altered expression of splicing factors.

Abstract: Summary
Pathway-targeted cancer drugs can produce dramatic responses that are invariably limited by the emergence of drug-resistant cells. We found that many drug-treated “oncogene-addicted” cancer cells engage a positive feedback loop leading to Stat3 activation, consequently promoting cell survival and limiting overall drug response. This was observed in cancer cells driven by diverse activated kinases, including EGFR, HER2, ALK, and MET, as well as mutant KRAS. Specifically, MEK inhibition led to autocrine activation of Stat3 via the FGF receptor and JAK kinases, and pharmacological inhibition of MEK together with JAK and FGFR enhanced tumor regression. These findings suggest that inhibition of a Stat3 feedback loop may augment the response to a broad spectrum of drugs that target pathways of oncogene addiction.

Abstract: Summary
The mammary epithelium is organized as a bilayer of luminal and basal/myoepithelial cells. During pregnancy, the luminal compartment expands for milk production, while basal cells are thought to provide structural and contractile support. Here, we reveal a pregnancy-specific role of basal epithelia as a central coordinator of lactogenesis. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of the transcription factor p63 (Trp63) gene exclusively within basal cells of the adult gland during pregnancy leads to dramatic defects in luminal cell proliferation and differentiation, resulting in lactation failure. This phenotype is explained by direct transcriptional activation of the epidermal growth factor family ligand gene Nrg1 by p63 selectively in basal cells, which is required for luminal ERBB4/STAT5A activation and consequent luminal progenitor cell maturation. Thus, paracrine basal-to-luminal cell signaling, controlled by p63 via NRG1, orchestrates the entire lactation program. Collectively, these findings redefine the paradigm for cellular interactions specifying the functional maturation of the mammary gland.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple synaptic adhesion molecules govern synapse formation. Here, we propose calsyntenin-3/alcadein-β as a synapse organizer that specifically induces presynaptic differentiation in heterologous synapse-formation assays. Calsyntenin-3 (CST-3) is highly expressed during various postnatal periods of mouse brain development. The simultaneous knockdown of all three CSTs, but not CST-3 alone, decreases inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapse densities in cultured hippocampal neurons. Moreover, the knockdown of CSTs specifically reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, the loss of CSTs induces a concomitant decrease in neuron soma size in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Furthermore, α-neurexins (α-Nrxs) are components of a CST-3 complex involved in CST-3-mediated presynaptic differentiation. However, CST-3 does not directly bind to Nrxs. Viewed together, these data suggest that the three CSTs redundantly regulate inhibitory synapse formation, inhibitory synapse function, and neuron development in concert with Nrxs.

Abstract: The developmental oogenesis of gorgonian coral was investigated at the histological level. The objective of this study was to examine and improve the understanding of Junceella juncea oogenesis using ultrastructural methods, such as histological sectioning and transmission electron microscopy. At least three types of yolk materials were observed in this study: yolk body, lipid granules and cortical alveoli. Some of the complex yolk materials were encompassed by concentric or arched layers of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex in early stage oocytes. Different types of vesicles were found in both early and late stage oocytes and some granules could be seen inside the empty vesicles. This may be a possible method for elaborating complex yolk materials. Homogeneous yolks from different types of inclusions were abundant and the autosynthesis of yolk may be a major mechanism in J. juncea oocytes. This is the first report of the ultrastructural observation of oogenesis in gorgonian coral species using transmission electron microscopy. Our study obtained relatively detailed information at the ultrastructural level, and it provides an overview of the oocyte ultrastucture of the gorgonian coral J. juncea.

Abstract: Summary
The homeostatic balance of hepatic glucose utilization, storage, and production is exquisitely controlled by hormonal signals and hepatic carbon metabolism during fed and fasted states. How the liver senses extracellular glucose to cue glucose utilization versus production is not fully understood. We show that the physiologic balance of hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is regulated by Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), a protein with roles in apoptosis and metabolism. BAD deficiency reprograms hepatic substrate and energy metabolism toward diminished glycolysis, excess fatty acid oxidation, and exaggerated glucose production that escapes suppression by insulin. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that BAD’s suppression of gluconeogenesis is actuated by phosphorylation of its BCL-2 homology (BH)-3 domain and subsequent activation of glucokinase. The physiologic relevance of these findings is evident from the ability of a BAD phosphomimic variant to counteract unrestrained gluconeogenesis and improve glycemia in leptin-resistant and high-fat diet models of diabetes and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling in the ancestral branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated by unconventional splicing of HAC1/XBP1 mRNA during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In mammals, IRE1α has been known to cleave the XBP1 intron. However, the enzyme responsible for ligation of two XBP1 exons remains unknown. Using an XBP1 splicing-based synthetic circuit, we identify RtcB as the primary UPR RNA ligase. In RtcB knockout cells, XBP1 mRNA splicing is defective during ER stress. Genetic rescue and in vitro splicing show that the RNA ligase activity of RtcB is directly required for the splicing of XBP1 mRNA. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RtcB is the long-sought RNA ligase that catalyzes unconventional RNA splicing during the mammalian UPR.

Abstract: Summary
Retinoic acid (RA)-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is highly upregulated and functionally implicated in the RA-induced maturation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts. However, the underlying mechanism and the biological relevance of RIG-I expression to the maintenance of leukemogenic potential are poorly understood. Here, we show that RIG-I, without priming by foreign RNA, inhibits the Src-facilitated activation of AKT-mTOR in AML cells. Moreover, in a group of primary human AML blasts, RIG-I reduction renders the Src family kinases hyperactive in promoting AKT activation. Mechanistically, a PxxP motif in RIG-I, upon the N-terminal CARDs’ association with the Src SH1 domain, competes with the AKT PxxP motif for recognizing the Src SH3 domain. In accordance, mutating PxxP motif prevents Rig-I from inhibiting AKT activation, cytokine-stimulated myeloid progenitor proliferation, and in vivo repopulating capacity of leukemia cells. Collectively, our data suggest an antileukemia activity of RIG-I via competitively inhibiting Src/AKT association.

Abstract: Summary
Misfolded proteins compromise cellular function and cause disease. How these proteins are detected and degraded is not well understood. Here we show that PML/TRIM19 and the SUMO-dependent ubiquitin ligase RNF4 act together to promote the degradation of misfolded proteins in the mammalian cell nucleus. PML selectively interacts with misfolded proteins through distinct substrate recognition sites and conjugates these proteins with the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) through its SUMO ligase activity. SUMOylated misfolded proteins are then recognized and ubiquitinated by RNF4 and are subsequently targeted for proteasomal degradation. We further show that PML deficiency exacerbates polyglutamine (polyQ) disease in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1). These findings reveal a mammalian system that removes misfolded proteins through sequential SUMOylation and ubiquitination and define its role in protection against protein-misfolding diseases.

Abstract: Summary
It has been proposed that Ataxin-2, a member of the like-Sm (LSm) protein family, participates in the regulation of RNA metabolism through interaction with PABPC1. However, the exact biological mechanism and in vivo targets remain unknown. Here, we report that Ataxin-2 binds directly to RNAs in a PABPC1-independent manner. High-throughput sequencing of Ataxin-2-bound RNAs prepared by PAR-CLIP revealed that Ataxin-2 binds predominantly to uridine-rich elements, including well-characterized cis-regulatory AU-rich elements, in the 3′ UTRs of target mRNAs. Gene expression analysis after Ataxin-2 depletion or overexpression revealed that Ataxin-2 stabilizes target mRNAs and increases the abundance of the corresponding proteins. A tethering assay demonstrated that Ataxin-2 elicits this effect by direct interaction with mRNAs. We also found that disease-associated polyglutamine expansion downregulates the physiological activity of Ataxin-2. These findings suggest that Ataxin-2 is an RNA-binding protein that targets cis-regulatory elements in 3′ UTRs to stabilize a subset of mRNAs and increase protein expression.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamically controlled posttranslational modifications of nucleosomal histones alter chromatin condensation to regulate transcriptional activation. We report that a nuclear tandem kinase, JIL-1, controls gene expression by activating poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). JIL-1 phosphorylates the C terminus of the H2Av histone variant, which stimulates PARP-1 enzymatic activity in the surrounding chromatin, leading to further modification of histones and chromatin loosening. The H2Av nucleosome has a higher surface representation of PARP-1 binding patch, consisting of H3 and H4 epitopes. Phosphorylation of H2Av by JIL-1 restructures this surface patch, leading to activation of PARP-1. Exposure of Val61 and Leu23 of the H4 histone is critical for PARP-1 binding on nucleosome and PARP-1 activation following H2Av phosphorylation. We propose that chromatin loosening and associated initiation of gene expression is activated by phosphorylation of H2Av in a nucleosome positioned in promoter regions of PARP-1-dependent genes.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres, epigenetically defined by the presence of the histone H3 variant CenH3, are essential for ensuring proper chromosome segregation. In mammals, centromeric CenH3CENP-A deposition requires its dedicated chaperone HJURP and occurs during telophase/early G1. We find that the cell-cycle-dependent recruitment of HJURP to centromeres depends on its timely phosphorylation controlled via cyclin-dependent kinases. A nonphosphorylatable HJURP mutant localizes prematurely to centromeres in S and G2 phase. This unregulated targeting causes a premature loading of CenH3CENP-A at centromeres, and cell-cycle delays ensue. Once recruited to centromeres, HJURP functions to promote CenH3CENP-A deposition by a mechanism involving a unique DNA-binding domain. With our findings, we propose a model wherein (1) the phosphorylation state of HJURP controls its centromeric recruitment in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, and (2) HJURP binding to DNA is a mechanistic determinant in CenH3CENP-A loading.

Abstract: Summary
Gli proteins are transcriptional effectors of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in both normal development and cancer. We describe a program of multisite phosphorylation that regulates the conversion of Gli proteins into transcriptional activators. In the absence of Hh ligands, Gli activity is restrained by the direct phosphorylation of six conserved serine residues by protein kinase A (PKA), a master negative regulator of the Hh pathway. Activation of signaling leads to a global remodeling of the Gli phosphorylation landscape: the PKA target sites become dephosphorylated, while a second cluster of sites undergoes phosphorylation. The pattern of Gli phosphorylation can regulate Gli transcriptional activity in a graded fashion, suggesting a phosphorylation-based mechanism for how a gradient of Hh signaling in a morphogenetic field can be converted into a gradient of transcriptional activity.

Abstract: Summary
We define the activity and mechanisms of action of a small molecule lead compound for cancer targeting. We show that the compound, BMH-21, has wide and potent antitumorigenic activity across NCI60 cancer cell lines and represses tumor growth in vivo. BMH-21 binds GC-rich sequences, which are present at a high frequency in ribosomal DNA genes, and potently and rapidly represses RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription. Strikingly, we find that BMH-21 causes proteasome-dependent destruction of RPA194, the large catalytic subunit protein of Pol I holocomplex, and this correlates with cancer cell killing. Our results show that Pol I activity is under proteasome-mediated control, which reveals an unexpected therapeutic opportunity.

Abstract: Summary
The serine/threonine kinase LKB1 is a tumor suppressor whose loss is associated with increased metastatic potential. In an effort to define biochemical signatures of metastasis associated with LKB1 loss, we discovered that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcription factor Snail1 was uniquely upregulated upon LKB1 deficiency across cell types. The ability of LKB1 to suppress Snail1 levels was independent of AMPK but required the related kinases MARK1 and MARK4. In a screen for substrates of these kinases involved in Snail regulation, we identified the scaffolding protein DIXDC1. Similar to loss of LKB1, DIXDC1 depletion results in upregulation of Snail1 in a FAK-dependent manner, leading to increased cell invasion. MARK1 phosphorylation of DIXDC1 is required for its localization to focal adhesions and ability to suppress metastasis in mice. DIXDC1 is frequently downregulated in human cancers, which correlates with poor survival. This study defines an AMPK-independent phosphorylation cascade essential for LKB1-dependent control of metastatic behavior.

Abstract: Summary
We performed massively parallel sequencing of paired tumor/normal samples from 203 multiple myeloma (MM) patients and identified significantly mutated genes and copy number alterations and discovered putative tumor suppressor genes by determining homozygous deletions and loss of heterozygosity. We observed frequent mutations in KRAS (particularly in previously treated patients), NRAS, BRAF, FAM46C, TP53, and DIS3 (particularly in nonhyperdiploid MM). Mutations were often present in subclonal populations, and multiple mutations within the same pathway (e.g., KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF) were observed in the same patient. In vitro modeling predicts only partial treatment efficacy of targeting subclonal mutations, and even growth promotion of nonmutated subclones in some cases. These results emphasize the importance of heterogeneity analysis for treatment decisions.

Abstract: Hesperidin is a naturally common flavonoid. It is an abundant and cheap by-product of citrus cultivation. It is reported to have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects. This work was performed to investigate the possible protective role of hesperidin in ameliorating the effect of experimentally induced intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) on lung tissue, histologically, immunohistochemically and biochemically. Thirty male Wistar adult albino rats were randomized into three groups named: group I (control group); group II (I/R); and group III (I/R with hesperidin). Intestinal I/R was induced by occluding the superior mesenteric artery for 60min, followed by 120min of reperfusion period. Animals were given hesperidin orally 1h before the onset of ischemia. At the end of the reperfusion period the lung tissues were extracted for histopathological examination and immunohistochemical detection of the distribution of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Pulmonary edema was evaluated by lung tissue wet/dry weight ratios. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA, a biomarker of oxidative damage), myeloperoxidase (MPO, an index of the degree of neutrophil accumulation) and glutathione (GSH, a biomarker of protective oxidative injury) were also determined in all dissected tissues. Pretreatment with hesperidin (in group III) alleviated lung morphological changes noticed in I/R group and the levels of MDA and MPO were significantly decreased whereas those of GSH were significantly increased. Immunohistochemical study revealed a significant decrease in the iNOS. Hesperidin also significantly alleviated the formation of pulmonary edema as evidenced by the decreased organ wet/dry weight ratios. Hesperidin exerts a protective effect against lung damage induced by intestinal I/R injury in rats by reducing oxidative stress.

The DNA methylation status of both promoters act equally in the epigenetic transcriptional regulation of their relevant isoforms. The aim of this study was to analyze the different effects of these p73 isoforms in 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC)-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We investigated the effects of the DNA demethylation agent, 5-aza-dC, on the T-47D breast cancer cell line, and evaluated the methylation status of the p73 promoters and expression of TAp73 and ΔNp73. Furthermore, we assessed the expression of p53 and p73 isoforms in 5-aza-dC-treated T-47D cells and p53 knockout cells. 5-aza-dC induced significant anti-tumor effects in T-47D cells, including inhibition of cell viability, G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. This was associated with p73 promoter demethylation and a concomitant increase in TAp73 mRNA and protein expression. In contrast, the methylation status of promoter P2 was not associated with ΔNp73 mRNA or protein levels. Furthermore, demethylation of P2 failed to inhibit the expression of ΔNp73 with 5-aza-dC in the p53 knockdown cell model. Our study suggests that demethylation of the P1 and P2 promoters has opposite effects on the expression of p73 isoforms, namely up-regulation of TAp73 and down-regulation of ΔΝp73. We also demonstrate that p53 likely contributes to 5-aza-dC-induced ΔNp73 transcriptional inactivation in breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells possess the capacity to generate two cells of distinct fate upon division: one cell retaining stem cell identity and the other cell destined to differentiate. These cell fates are established by cell-type-specific genetic networks. To comprehensively identify components of these networks, we performed a large-scale RNAi screen in Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) covering ∼25% of the genome. The screen identified 366 genes that affect GSC maintenance, differentiation, or other processes involved in oogenesis. Comparison of GSC regulators with neural stem cell self-renewal factors identifies common and cell-type-specific self-renewal genes. Importantly, we identify the histone methyltransferase Set1 as a GSC-specific self-renewal factor. Loss of Set1 in neural stem cells does not affect cell fate decisions, suggesting a differential requirement of H3K4me3 in different stem cell lineages. Altogether, our study provides a resource that will help to further dissect the networks underlying stem cell self-renewal.

Abstract: Classic calcium hypothesis states that depolarization-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) triggers vesicle exocytosis by increasing vesicle release probability in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. The extracellular Ca2+, in this calcium hypothesis, serves as a reservoir of Ca2+ source. Recently we find that extracellular Ca2+ per se inhibits the [Ca2+]i dependent vesicle exocytosis, but it remains unclear whether quantal size is regulated by extracellular, or intracellular Ca2+ or both [1]. In this work we showed that, in physiological condition, extracellular Ca2+ per se specifically inhibited the quantal size of single vesicle release in rat adrenal slice chromaffin cells. The extracellular Ca2+ in physiological concentration (2.5mM) directly regulated fusion pore kinetics of spontaneous quantal release of catecholamine. In addition, removal of extracellular Ca2+ directly triggered vesicle exocytosis without eliciting intracellular Ca2+. We propose that intracellular Ca2+ and extracellular Ca2+ per se cooperately regulate single vesicle exocytosis. The vesicle release probability was jointly modulated by both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+, while the vesicle quantal size was mainly determined by extracellular Ca2+ in chromaffin cells physiologically.

Abstract: Summary
RIG-I activates interferon signaling pathways by promoting filament formation of the adaptor molecule, MAVS. Assembly of the MAVS filament is mediated by its CARD domain (CARDMAVS), and requires its interaction with the tandem CARDs of RIG-I (2CARDRIG-I). However, the precise nature of the interaction between 2CARDRIG-I and CARDMAVS, and how this interaction leads to CARDMAVS filament assembly, has been unclear. Here we report a 3.6 Å electron microscopy structure of the CARDMAVS filament and a 3.4 Å crystal structure of the 2CARDRIG-I:CARDMAVS complex, representing 2CARDRIG-I “caught in the act” of nucleating the CARDMAVS filament. These structures, together with functional analyses, show that 2CARDRIG-I acts as a template for the CARDMAVS filament assembly, by forming a helical tetrameric structure and recruiting CARDMAVS along its helical trajectory. Our work thus reveals that signal activation by RIG-I occurs by imprinting its helical assembly architecture on MAVS, a previously uncharacterized mechanism of signal transmission.

Abstract: Cardiac fibrosis is involved in a lot of cardiovascular pathological processes. Cardiac fibrosis can block conduction, cause hypoxia, strengthen myocardial stiffness, create electrical heterogeneity, and hamper systolic ejection, which is associated with the development of arrhythmia, heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Besides the initial stimulating factors, the cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the principal responsible cells in the fibrogenesis cascade of events. TRPM7, a member of the TRPM (Melastatin) subfamily, is a non-selective cation channel, which permeates both Ca2+ and Mg2+. Here we demonstrated TRPM7 expression in CFs, and 2-APB (TRPM7 inhibitor), inhibited Ang II-induced CTGF, α-SMA expression and CFs proliferation. Besides, knocking down TRPM7 by shRNA, we proved that TRPM7 mediated both calcium and magnesium changes in cardiac fibroblasts which contribute to fibrosis progress. This study suggested that TRPM7 should play a pivotal role in cardiac fibroblast functions associated to cardiac fibrosis development.

Abstract: The β2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) is a G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor expressed in the human respiratory tract and widely recognized as a pharmacological target for treatments of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). Although a number of ADRB2 agonists have been developed for use in asthma therapy, indacaterol is the only ultra-long-acting inhaled β2-agonist (LABA) approved by the FDA for relieving the symptoms in COPD patients. The precise molecular mechanism underlying the pharmacological effect of indacaterol, however, remains unclear. Here, we show that β-arrestin-2 mediates the internalization of ADRB2 following indacaterol treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate that indacaterol significantly inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB activity by reducing levels of both phosphorylated-IKK and -IκBα, thereby decreasing NF-κB nuclear translocation and the expression of MMP-9, an NF-κB target gene. Subsequently, we show that indacaterol significantly inhibits TNF-α/NF-κB-induced cell invasiveness and migration in a human cancer cell line. In conclusion, we propose that indacaterol may inhibit NF-κB activity in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner, preventing further lung damage and improving lung function in COPD patients.

Abstract: Summary
Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by cellular sensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinkers. The molecular defect in FA is an impaired DNA repair pathway. The critical event in activating this pathway is monoubiquitination of FANCD2. In vivo, a multisubunit FA core complex catalyzes this step, but its mechanism is unclear. Here, we report purification of a native avian FA core complex and biochemical reconstitution of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. This demonstrates that the catalytic FANCL E3 ligase subunit must be embedded within the complex for maximal activity and site specificity. We genetically and biochemically define a minimal subcomplex comprising just three proteins (FANCB, FANCL, and FAAP100) that functions as the monoubiquitination module. Residual FANCD2 monoubiquitination activity is retained in cells defective for other FA core complex subunits. This work describes the in vitro reconstitution and characterization of this multisubunit monoubiquitin E3 ligase, providing key insight into the conserved FA DNA repair pathway.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are deleterious lesions that lead to genetic mutations and cell death. Protein ubiquitination mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8 within the regions surrounding DSBs recruits DNA DSB response (DDR) factors and induces chromatin remodeling, which supports cell survival after DNA damage. Nevertheless, the impact of RNF8-mediated ubiquitination on DNA repair remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that depletion of the deubiquitinating enzyme OTUB2 enhances RNF8-mediated ubiquitination in an early phase of the DDR and promotes faster DSB repair but suppresses homologous recombination. The rapid ubiquitination results in accelerated accumulation of 53BP1 and RAP80 at DSBs, which in turn protects DSB ends from resection in OTUB2-depleted cells. Mechanistically, OTUB2 suppresses RNF8-mediated L3MBTL1 ubiquitination and Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chain formation in a deubiquitinating activity-dependent manner. Thus, OTUB2 fine-tunes the speed of DSB-induced ubiquitination so that the appropriate DNA repair pathway is chosen.

Abstract: Summary
RNA sequences are expected to be identical to their corresponding DNA sequences. Here, we found all 12 types of RNA-DNA sequence differences (RDDs) in nascent RNA. Our results show that RDDs begin to occur in RNA chains ∼55 nt from the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) active site. These RDDs occur so soon after transcription that they are incompatible with known deaminase-mediated RNA-editing mechanisms. Moreover, the 55 nt delay in appearance indicates that they do not arise during RNA synthesis by Pol II or as a direct consequence of modified base incorporation. Preliminary data suggest that RDD and R-loop formations may be coupled. These findings identify sequence substitution as an early step in cotranscriptional RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses interact extensively with host proteins, but the mechanisms controlling these interactions are not well understood. We present a comprehensive analysis of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) in 2,208 viral genomes and reveal that viruses exploit molecular mimicry of host-like ELMs to possibly assist in host-virus interactions. Using a statistical genomics approach, we identify a large number of potentially functional ELMs and observe that the occurrence of ELMs is often evolutionarily conserved but not uniform across virus families. Some viral proteins contain multiple types of ELMs, in striking similarity to complex regulatory modules in host proteins, suggesting that ELMs may act combinatorially to assist viral replication. Furthermore, a simple evolutionary model suggests that the inherent structural simplicity of ELMs often enables them to tolerate mutations and evolve quickly. Our findings suggest that ELMs may allow fast rewiring of host-virus interactions, which likely assists rapid viral evolution and adaptation to diverse environments.

Abstract: Summary
Leptin has beneficial effects on glucose metabolism via actions in the hypothalamus, but the roles of specific subgroups of neurons responsible for these antidiabetic effects remain unresolved. We generated diabetic Lepob/ob or Leprdb/db mice lacking or re-expressing leptin receptors (LepRb) in subgroups of neurons to explore their contributions to leptin’s glucose-lowering actions. We show that agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are both required and sufficient to correct hyperglycemia by leptin. LepRb in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons or steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) neurons are not required. Furthermore, normalization of blood glucose by leptin is blunted in Lepob/ob/MC4R-null mice, but not in Lepob/ob mice lacking neuropeptide Y (NPY) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in AgRP neurons. Leptin’s ability to improve glucose balance is accompanied by a reduction in circulating glucagon. We conclude that AgRP neurons play a crucial role in glucose-lowering actions by leptin and that this requires the melanocortin system, but not NPY and GABA.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is an essential degradative pathway in neurons, yet little is known about mechanisms driving autophagy in highly polarized cells. Here, we use dual-color live-cell imaging to investigate the neuron-specific mechanisms of constitutive autophagosome biogenesis in primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and hippocampal cultures. Under basal conditions, autophagosomes are continuously generated in the axon tip. There is an ordered assembly of proteins recruited with stereotypical kinetics onto the developing autophagosome. Plasma- or mitochondrial-derived membranes were not incorporated into nascent autophagosomes in the distal axon. Rather, autophagosomes are generated at double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1)-positive subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), distinct from ER exit sites. Biogenesis events are enriched distally; autophagosomes form infrequently in dendrites, the soma, or midaxon, consistent with a compartmentalized pathway for constitutive autophagy in primary neurons. Distal biogenesis may facilitate degradation of damaged mitochondria and long-lived cytoplasmic proteins reaching the axon tip via slow axonal transport.

The Histone Methyltransferase Activity of MLL1 Is Dispensable for Hematopoiesis and Leukemogenesis,

Abstract: Summary
Despite correlations between histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity and gene regulation, direct evidence that HMT activity is responsible for gene activation is sparse. We address the role of the HMT activity for MLL1, a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase critical for maintaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we show that the SET domain, and thus HMT activity of MLL1, is dispensable for maintaining HSCs and supporting leukemogenesis driven by the MLL-AF9 fusion oncoprotein. Upon Mll1 deletion, histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation is selectively depleted at MLL1 target genes in conjunction with reduced transcription. Surprisingly, inhibition of SIRT1 is sufficient to prevent the loss of H4K16 acetylation and the reduction in MLL1 target gene expression. Thus, recruited MOF activity, and not the intrinsic HMT activity of MLL1, is central for the maintenance of HSC target genes. In addition, this work reveals a role for SIRT1 in opposing MLL1 function.

Abstract: Summary
The mitotic spindle is defined by its organized, bipolar mass of microtubules, which drive chromosome alignment and segregation. Although different cells have been shown to use different molecular pathways to generate the microtubules required for spindle formation, how these pathways are coordinated within a single cell is poorly understood. We have tested the limits within which the Drosophila embryonic spindle forms, disrupting the inherent temporal control that overlays mitotic microtubule generation, interfering with the molecular mechanism that generates new microtubules from preexisting ones, and disrupting the spatial relationship between microtubule nucleation and the usually dominant centrosome. Our work uncovers the possible routes to spindle formation in embryos and establishes the central role of Augmin in all microtubule-generating pathways. It also demonstrates that the contributions of each pathway to spindle formation are integrated, highlighting the remarkable flexibility with which cells can respond to perturbations that limit their capacity to generate microtubules.

Abstract: Summary
The MRN complex (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) is important in double-strand break (DSB) recognition, end resection, replication fork stabilization, and ATM and ATR activation. Complete deletion of MRN is incompatible with cell and organism life, presumably due to replication-born DSBs; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We devised a noninvasive high-content assay, termed high-content microscopy-assisted cell-cycle phenotyping (hiMAC), to investigate the fate of cells lacking Nbs1. Surprisingly, deletion of Nbs1 does not kill cells during replication. The primary lesions in Nbs1-deleted cells are replication intermediates that result from defective resolution rather than fork destabilization. These lesions are converted to DSBs in the subsequent G2 phase, which subsequently activate Chk1, delay G2 progression, and lead to chromosome instability. Nbs1-deleted cells establish a DSB equilibrium that permits cell cycling but activates p53, causing G1 and G2 arrest, and cell death. Thus, we identify a physiological role of Nbs1 in the resolution of stalled replication forks.

Abstract: Summary
Nav1.7, a peripheral neuron voltage-gated sodium channel, is essential for pain and olfaction in mice and humans. We examined the role of Nav1.7 as well as Nav1.3, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 in different mouse models of chronic pain. Constriction-injury-dependent neuropathic pain is abolished when Nav1.7 is deleted in sensory neurons, unlike nerve-transection-related pain, which requires the deletion of Nav1.7 in sensory and sympathetic neurons for pain relief. Sympathetic sprouting that develops in parallel with nerve-transection pain depends on the presence of Nav1.7 in sympathetic neurons. Mechanical and cold allodynia required distinct sets of neurons and different repertoires of sodium channels depending on the nerve injury model. Surprisingly, pain induced by the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin and cancer-induced bone pain do not require the presence of Nav1.7 sodium channels or Nav1.8-positive nociceptors. Thus, similar pain phenotypes arise through distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms. Therefore, rational analgesic drug therapy requires patient stratification in terms of mechanisms and not just phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling crosstalk between tumor cells and fibroblasts confers proinvasive properties to the tumor microenvironment. Here, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a tumor promoter that mediates proinvasive activation of stromal fibroblasts independent of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression. We demonstrate that a pulse of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) establishes stable proinvasive fibroblast activation by inducing LIF production in both fibroblasts and tumor cells. In fibroblasts, LIF mediates TGF-β-dependent actomyosin contractility and extracellular matrix remodeling, which results in collective carcinoma cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, carcinomas from multiple origins and melanomas display strong LIF upregulation, which correlates with dense collagen fiber organization, cancer cell collective invasion, and poor clinical outcome. Blockade of JAK activity by Ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor) counteracts fibroblast-dependent carcinoma cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. These findings establish LIF as a proinvasive fibroblast producer independent of α-SMA and may open novel therapeutic perspectives for patients with aggressive primary tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), endothelial-specific secretory granules that are central to primary hemostasis and inflammation, occur in dimensions ranging between 0.5 and 5 μm. How their size is determined and whether it has a functional relevance are at present unknown. Here, we provide evidence for a dual role of the Golgi apparatus in controlling the size of these secretory carriers. At the ministack level, cisternae constrain the size of nanostructures (“quanta”) of von Willebrand factor (vWF), the main WPB cargo. The ribbon architecture of the Golgi then allows copackaging of a variable number of vWF quanta within the continuous lumen of the trans-Golgi network, thereby generating organelles of different sizes. Reducing the WPB size abates endothelial cell hemostatic function by drastically diminishing platelet recruitment, but, strikingly, the inflammatory response (the endothelial capacity to engage leukocytes) is unaltered. Size can thus confer functional plasticity to an organelle by differentially affecting its activities.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic progression of cancer is associated with poor outcome, and here we examine metabolic changes underlying this process. Although aerobic glycolysis is known to promote metastasis, we have now identified a different switch primarily affecting mitochondria. The switch involves overload of the electron transport chain (ETC) with preserved mitochondrial functions but increased mitochondrial superoxide production. It provides a metastatic advantage phenocopied by partial ETC inhibition, another situation associated with enhanced superoxide production. Both cases involved protein tyrosine kinases Src and Pyk2 as downstream effectors. Thus, two different events, ETC overload and partial ETC inhibition, promote superoxide-dependent tumor cell migration, invasion, clonogenicity, and metastasis. Consequently, specific scavenging of mitochondrial superoxide with mitoTEMPO blocked tumor cell migration and prevented spontaneous tumor metastasis in murine and human tumor models.

Abstract: Summary
The Mcm2–7 replicative helicase is central to all steps of eukaryotic DNA replication. The hexameric ring of Mcm subunits forms six essential ATPases whose contributions to replication initiation remain unclear. Mcm2–7 complexes containing ATPase-motif mutations showed Mcm2–7 ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for helicase loading. Loading-defective Mcm2–7 mutant complexes were defective in initial Mcm2–7 recruitment or Cdt1 release. Comparison with Cdc6 ATPase mutants showed that Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is not required for helicase loading but instead drives removal of Mcm2–7 complexes that cannot complete loading. A subset of Mcm2–7 ATPase-site mutants completed helicase loading but could not initiate replication. Individual mutants were defective in distinct events during helicase activation, including maintenance of DNA association, recruitment of the GINS helicase activator, and DNA unwinding. Consistent with its heterohexameric structure, our findings show that the six Mcm2–7 ATPase active sites are specialized for different functions during helicase loading and activation.

Abstract: Summary
Diverse environmental cues converge on and are integrated by the mTOR signaling network to control cellular growth and homeostasis. The mammalian Tsc1-Tsc2 GTPase activating protein (GAP) heterodimer is a critical negative regulator of Rheb and mTOR activation. The RalGAPα-RalGAPβ heterodimer shares sequence and structural similarity with Tsc1-Tsc2. Unexpectedly, we observed that C. elegans expresses orthologs for the Rheb and RalA/B GTPases and for RalGAPα/β, but not Tsc1/2. This prompted our investigation to determine whether RalGAPs additionally modulate mTOR signaling. We determined that C. elegans RalGAP loss decreased lifespan, consistent with a Tsc-like function. Additionally, RalGAP suppression in mammalian cells caused RalB-selective activation and Sec5- and exocyst-dependent engagement of mTORC1 and suppression of autophagy. Unexpectedly, we also found that Tsc1-Tsc2 loss activated RalA/B independently of Rheb-mTOR signaling. Finally, RalGAP suppression caused mTORC1-dependent pancreatic tumor cell invasion. Our findings identify an unexpected crosstalk and integration of the Ral and mTOR signaling networks.

Abstract: Induction of NF-κB-mediated gene expression has been identified in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is a piperazine derivative drug with anti-inflammatory properties. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of DEC on NF-κB pathways in mice undergoing alcoholism induced hepatic inflammation. Forty male C57BL/6 mice were divided equally into four groups: control group (C); DEC-treated group, which received 50mg/kg (DEC50); alcoholic group (EtOH), submitted to chronic alcohol consumption and the alcohol-DEC treated group (EtOH50), submitted to chronic alcoholism consumption plus DEC treatment. Histological analysis of the alcoholic group showed evident hepatocellular damage which was reduced in EtOH50 group. Immunohistochemistry and western blot results showed elevated expression of inflammatory markers such as MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2 and iNOS in hepatocytes of EtOH group. However, low immunopositivity for these markers was detected following DEC treatment. In the EtOH group the activation of NF-κB was observed by an increase in the expression of both NF-κB and pNF-κB in hepatocytes. This expression was significantly reduced in livers of EtOH50 group. Protein expression of Iκβα was measured to determine whether activation of NF-κB might be the result of Iκβα degradation. It was observed that expression of this protein was low in EtOH group, while animals treated with DEC had a high expression of Iκβα. The results of the present study indicate that DEC alleviates alcoholic liver injury, in part by the inhibiting activation of NF-κB and by suppressing the induction of NF-κB-dependent genes.

Abstract: Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from abnormal cellular process lead to various human diseases such as inflammation, ischemia, and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sensitive to apoptosis gene (SAG), a RING-FINGER protein, has anti-apoptotic activity and anti-oxidant activity. In this study, we investigate whether Tat-SAG, fused with a Tat domain, could protect SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine (MPTP) toxicity. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis showed that, unlike SAG, Tat-SAG transduced efficiently into SH-SY5Y cells and into the brain, respectively. Tat-SAG remarkably suppressed ROS generation, DNA damage, and the progression of apoptosis, caused by MPP+ in SH-SY5Y cells. Also, immunohistochemical data using a tyrosine hydroxylase antibody and cresyl violet staining demonstrated that Tat-SAG obviously protected DA neurons in the SN against MPTP toxicity in a PD mouse model. Tat-SAG-treated mice showed significant enhanced motor activities, compared to SAG- or Tat-treated mice. Therefore, our results suggest that Tat-SAG has potential as a therapeutic agent against ROS-related diseases such as PD.

Abstract: Summary
Amplification of the EMSY gene in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers is a poor prognostic indicator. Although EMSY has been linked to transcriptional silencing, its mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we report that EMSY acts as an oncogene, causing the transformation of cells in vitro and potentiating tumor formation and metastatic features in vivo. We identify an inverse correlation between EMSY amplification and miR-31 expression, an antimetastatic microRNA, in the METABRIC cohort of human breast samples. Re-expression of miR-31 profoundly reduced cell migration, invasion, and colony-formation abilities of cells overexpressing EMSY or haboring EMSY amplification. We show that EMSY is recruited to the miR-31 promoter by the DNA binding factor ETS-1, and it represses miR-31 transcription by delivering the H3K4me3 demethylase JARID1b/PLU-1/KDM5B. Altogether, these results suggest a pathway underlying the role of EMSY in breast cancer and uncover potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in sporadic breast cancer.

Abstract: ICa-gated Ca2+ release (CICR) from the cardiac SR is the main mechanism mediating the rise of cytosolic Ca2+, but the extent to which mitochondria contribute to the overall Ca2+ signaling remains controversial. To examine the possible role of mitochondria in Ca2+ signaling, we developed a low affinity mitochondrial Ca2+ probe, mitycam-E31Q (300–500 MOI, 48–72h) and used it in conjunction with Fura-2AM to obtain simultaneous TIRF images of mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Mitycam-E31Q staining of adult feline cardiomyocytes showed the typical mitochondrial longitudinal fluorescent bandings similar to that of TMRE staining, while neonatal rat cardiomyocytes had a disorganized tubular or punctuate appearance. Caffeine puffs produced rapid increases in cytosolic Ca2+ while simultaneously measured global mitycam-E31Q signals decreased more slowly (increased mitochondrial Ca2+) before decaying to baseline levels. Similar, but oscillating mitycam-E31Q signals were seen in spontaneously pacing cells. Withdrawal of Na+ increased global cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in one population of mitochondria, but unexpectedly decreased it (release of Ca2+) in another mitochondrial population. Such mitochondrial Ca2+ release signals were seen not only during long lasting Na+ withdrawal, but also when Ca2+ loaded cells were exposed to caffeine-puffs, and during spontaneous rhythmic beating. Thus, mitochondrial Ca2+ transients appear to activate with a delay following the cytosolic rise of Ca2+ and show diversity in subpopulations of mitochondria that could contribute to the plasticity of mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling.

Abstract: The contribution of the Ca2+ sensor S100A1 to in vivo Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathobiology has not been elucidated although S100A1 regulates numerous cellular processes linked to AD. This study uses genetic ablation to ascertain the effects of S100A1 on neuroinflammation, beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition and Akt activity in the PSAPP AD mouse model. PSAPP/S100A1−/− mice exhibited decreases in astrocytosis (GFAP burden), microgliosis (Iba1 burden) and plaque load/number when compared to PSAPP/S100A1+/+ mice at six and twelve months of age. The presence of detectable S100A1 staining in human AD specimens is consistent with a detrimental gain of S100A1 function in AD. S100A1 ablation also reduced plaque associated and increased non-plaque associated PO4-Akt and PO4-GSK3β staining. S100A1·Akt complexes were undetectable in PC12 cells and AD brain tissue suggesting that S100A1 indirectly modulates Akt activity. In contrast, S100A1·RyR (ryanodine receptor) complexes were present in human/mouse AD brain and exhibited Ca2+-dependent formation in neuronal cells. This is the first direct demonstration of an S100A1· target protein complex in tissue/cells and identifies the RyR as a primary S100A1 target protein in the brain. Collectively, these data suggest that S100A1 inhibition may be a novel strategy for normalizing aberrant Ca2+ signaling in AD.

Abstract: Summary
UHRF1 is a multidomain protein crucially linking histone H3 modification states and DNA methylation. While the interaction properties of its specific domains are well characterized, little is known about the regulation of these functionalities. We show that UHRF1 exists in distinct active states, binding either unmodified H3 or the H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) modification. A polybasic region (PBR) in the C terminus blocks interaction of a tandem tudor domain (TTD) with H3K9me3 by occupying an essential peptide-binding groove. In this state the plant homeodomain (PHD) mediates interaction with the extreme N terminus of the unmodified H3 tail. Binding of the phosphatidylinositol phosphate PI5P to the PBR of UHRF1 results in a conformational rearrangement of the domains, allowing the TTD to bind H3K9me3. Our results define an allosteric mechanism controlling heterochromatin association of an essential regulatory protein of epigenetic states and identify a functional role for enigmatic nuclear phosphatidylinositol phosphates.
