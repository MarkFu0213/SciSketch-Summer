Abstract: Summary
Malaria infection by Plasmodium falciparum continues to pose a global threat to the human population. P. falciparum expresses variable erythrocyte surface antigens such as RIFINs. Public antibodies with LAIR1 insertion have been identified from malarial patients against a subset of RIFINs. In this study, we solve a LAIR1-binding RIFIN structure: the complex structures of two RIFINs bound to mutated or wild-type LAIR1 in two distinct patterns. Notably, the two RIFINs engage similar binding sites on LAIR1 with different angles, and the RIFIN-binding sites overlap with the collagen-binding site. Surprisingly, RIFINs use completely different binding sites to bind to LAIR1 or LILRB1, indicating the kaleidoscopic change of RIFINs. We then verify that RIFIN could induce LAIR1-mediated cell signaling, and LAIR1-containing antibodies could block the pathway. The findings of this study provide structural insights into the mechanism of the immune escape of P. falciparum and the endless arms race between parasite and host.

Abstract: Endometrium is a dynamic tissue that undergoes extensive remodelling to attain a receptive state which is further modulated in presence of an embryo for successful initiation of pregnancy. Cadherins are the proteins of the junctional complex of which E-cadherin (E-Cad) is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell state and integrity of the epithelial barrier; gain of N-cadherin (N-Cad) in epithelial cells leads to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study, we investigated the expression of E-Cad and N-Cad in the mouse endometrial luminal epithelium and its modulation by estrogen, progesterone, and embryonic stimuli. We observed that E-Cad is diffusely expressed in the luminal epithelium of mouse endometrium during the estrus stage and upon estrogen treatment. It is apico-laterally and basolaterally sorted at the diestrus stage and in response to the combined treatment of estrogen and progesterone. In 3D spheroids of human endometrial epithelial cells, combined treatment with estrogen and progesterone led to lateral sorting of E-Cad without any effects on its mRNA levels. at the time of embryo implantation, there is loss of E-Cad along with the gain of N-Cad and SNAIL expression suggestive of EMT in the luminal epithelium. This EMT is possibly driven by embryonic stimuli as treatment with estrogen and progesterone did not lead to the gain of N-Cad expression in the mouse endometrium in vivo or in human endometrial epithelial cells in vitro. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that steroid hormones directly affect E-Cad sorting in the endometrial epithelium which undergo EMT in response to embryonic stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
Aging, genomic stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction are risk factors for neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Parkinson disease (PD). Although genomic instability is associated with aging and mitochondrial impairment, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that base excision repair generates genomic stress, promoting age-related neurodegeneration in a Caenorhabditis elegans PD model. A physiological level of NTH-1 DNA glycosylase mediates mitochondrial and nuclear genomic instability, which promote degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in older nematodes. Conversely, NTH-1 deficiency protects against α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity, maintaining neuronal function with age. This apparent paradox is caused by modulation of mitochondrial transcription in NTH-1-deficient cells, and this modulation activates LMD-3, JNK-1, and SKN-1 and induces mitohormesis. The dependance of neuroprotection on mitochondrial transcription highlights the integration of BER and transcription regulation during physiological aging. Finally, whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA from patients with idiopathic PD suggests that base excision repair might modulate susceptibility to PD in humans.

Abstract: During pregnancy, both the maternal endometrium and the blastocyst have highly glycosylated proteins with glycosylations controlled in a specific manner. Carbohydrates play a fundamental role in cell-cell and cell-matrix recognition and are involved in defining the structure and integrity of tissues. The uterus’ secretions, which are rich in glycoproteins and glycogen and the presence of a functional glycocalyx on the uterine epithelium, establish a favourable milieu, which is essential for the correct implantation and subsequent development of the blastocyst. Likewise, carbohydrate residues such as fucose and sialic acid present at the placental level are determinant in creating an immuno-environment, which supports the mother's tolerance towards the fetal antigens. In this review, we explore the literature concerning the role of important glycan-epitopes at the feto-maternal interface in the human species. Moreover, we also show some unpublished interesting results on changes of glycan residues in human placenta tissues from the first trimester of pregnancy.

Abstract: Memory T (TM) cells play an important role in the long-term defense against pathogen reinvasion. However, it is still unclear how these cells receive the crucial signals necessary for their longevity and homeostatic turnover. To understand how TM cells receive these signals, we infected mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and examined the expression sites of neural cadherin (N-cadherin) by immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that N-cadherin was expressed in the surroundings of the white pulps of the spleen and medulla of lymph nodes (LNs). Moreover, TM cells expressing high levels of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), a ligand of N-cadherin, were co-localized with N-cadherin+ cells in the spleen but not in LNs. We then blocked N-cadherin in vivo to investigate whether it regulates the formation or function of TM cells. The numbers of CD127hiCD62Lhi TM cells in the spleen of memory P14 chimeric mice declined when N-cadherin was blocked during the contraction phase, without functional impairment of these cells. In addition, when CD127loKLRG1hi TM cells were adoptively transferred into anti–N-cadherin–treated mice compared with control mice, the number of these cells was reduced in the bone marrow and LNs, without functional loss. Taken together, our results suggest that N-cadherin participates in the development of CD127hiCD62Lhi TM cells and homing of CD127loKLRG1hi TM cells to lymphoid organs.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism of vulnerability to pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs)—the most common brain tumor in children—during development remains largely unknown. Using mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated pLGGs in the optic pathway (NF1-OPG), we demonstrate that NF1-OPG arose from the vulnerability to the dependency of Mek-Erk/MAPK signaling during gliogenesis of one of the two developmentally transient precursor populations in the optic nerve, brain-derived migrating glial progenitors (GPs), but not local progenitors. Hyperactive Erk/MAPK signaling by Nf1 loss overproduced GPs by disrupting the balance between stem-cell maintenance and gliogenesis of hypothalamic ventricular zone radial glia (RG). Persistence of RG-like GPs initiated NF1-OPG, causing Bax-dependent apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells. Removal of three Mek1/Mek2 alleles or transient post-natal treatment with a low-dose MEK inhibitor normalized differentiation of Nf1−/− RG-like GPs, preventing NF1-OPG formation and neuronal degeneration. We provide the proof-of-concept evidence for preventing pLGGs before tumor-associated neurological damage enters an irreversible phase.

Abstract: Summary
Pain, whether acute or persistent, is a serious medical problem worldwide. However, its management remains unsatisfactory, and new analgesic molecules are required. We show here that TAFA4 reverses inflammatory, postoperative, and spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in male and female mice. TAFA4 requires functional low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRPs) because their inhibition by RAP (receptor-associated protein) dose-dependently abolishes its antihypersensitive actions. SNI selectively decreases A-type K+ current (IA) in spinal lamina II outer excitatory interneurons (L-IIo ExINs) and induces a concomitant increase in IA and decrease in hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) in lamina II inner inhibitory interneurons (L-IIi InhINs). Remarkably, SNI-induced ion current alterations in both IN subtypes were rescued by TAFA4 in an LRP-dependent manner. We provide insights into the mechanism by which TAFA4 reverses injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity by restoring normal spinal neuron activity and highlight the considerable potential of TAFA4 as a treatment for injury-induced mechanical pain.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer patients often die from symptoms that manifest at a distance from any tumor. Mechanisms underlying these systemic physiological perturbations, called paraneoplastic syndromes, may benefit from investigation in non-mammalian systems. Using a non-metastatic Drosophila adult model, we find that malignant-tumor-produced cytokines drive widespread host activation of JAK-STAT signaling and cause premature lethality. STAT activity is particularly high in cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where it induces aberrant BBB permeability. Remarkably, inhibiting STAT in the BBB not only rescues barrier function but also extends the lifespan of tumor-bearing hosts. We identify BBB damage in other pathological conditions that cause elevated inflammatory signaling, including obesity and infection, where BBB permeability also regulates host survival. IL-6-dependent BBB dysfunction is further seen in a mouse tumor model, and it again promotes host morbidity. Therefore, BBB alterations constitute a conserved lethal tumor-host interaction that also underlies other physiological morbidities.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic cross-feeding frequently underlies mutualistic relationships in natural microbial communities and is often exploited to assemble synthetic microbial consortia. We systematically identified all single-gene knockouts suitable for imposing cross-feeding in Escherichia coli and used this information to assemble syntrophic communities. Most strains benefiting from shared goods were dysfunctional in biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins or mutants in central carbon metabolism. We tested cross-feeding potency in 1,444 strain pairs and mapped the interaction network between all functional groups of mutants. This network revealed that auxotrophs for vitamins are optimal cooperators. Lastly, we monitored how assemblies composed of dozens of auxotrophs change over time and observed that they rapidly and repeatedly coalesced to seven strain consortia composed primarily from vitamin auxotrophs. The composition of emerging consortia suggests that they were stabilized by multiple cross-feeding interactions. We conclude that vitamins are ideal shared goods since they optimize consortium growth while still imposing member co-dependence.

Abstract: Summary
During Drosophila metamorphosis, dorsal and ventral wing surfaces adhere, separate, and reappose in a paradoxical process involving cell-matrix adhesion, matrix production and degradation, and long cellular projections. The identity of the intervening matrix, the logic behind the adhesion-reapposition cycle, and the role of projections are unknown. We find that laminin matrix spots devoid of other main basement membrane components mediate wing adhesion. Through live imaging, we show that long microtubule-actin cables grow from those adhesion spots because of hydrostatic pressure that pushes wing surfaces apart. Formation of cables resistant to pressure requires spectraplakin, Patronin, septins, and Sdb, a SAXO1/2 microtubule stabilizer expressed under control of wing intervein-selector SRF. Silkworms and dead-leaf butterflies display similar dorso-ventral projections and expression of Sdb in intervein SRF-like patterns. Our study supports the morphogenetic importance of atypical basement-membrane-related matrices and dissects matrix-cytoskeleton coordination in a process of great evolutionary significance.

Abstract: Summary
Cell death provides host defense and maintains homeostasis. Zα-containing molecules are essential for these processes. Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) activates inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, whereas adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) serves as an RNA editor to maintain homeostasis. Here, we identify and characterize ADAR1’s interaction with ZBP1, defining its role in cell death regulation and tumorigenesis. Combining interferons (IFNs) and nuclear export inhibitors (NEIs) activates ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis. ADAR1 suppresses this PANoptosis by interacting with the Zα2 domain of ZBP1 to limit ZBP1 and RIPK3 interactions. Adar1fl/flLysMcre mice are resistant to development of colorectal cancer and melanoma, but deletion of the ZBP1 Zα2 domain restores tumorigenesis in these mice. In addition, treating wild-type mice with IFN-γ and the NEI KPT-330 regresses melanoma in a ZBP1-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that ADAR1 suppresses ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis, promoting tumorigenesis. Defining the functions of ADAR1 and ZBP1 in cell death is fundamental to informing therapeutic strategies for cancer and other diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Biological heterogeneity in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is partly driven by cell-of-origin subtypes and associated genomic lesions, but also by diverse cell types and cell states in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, dissecting these cell states and their clinical relevance at scale remains challenging. Here, we implemented EcoTyper, a machine-learning framework integrating transcriptome deconvolution and single-cell RNA sequencing, to characterize clinically relevant DLBCL cell states and ecosystems. Using this approach, we identified five cell states of malignant B cells that vary in prognostic associations and differentiation status. We also identified striking variation in cell states for 12 other lineages comprising the TME and forming cell state interactions in stereotyped ecosystems. While cell-of-origin subtypes have distinct TME composition, DLBCL ecosystems capture clinical heterogeneity within existing subtypes and extend beyond cell-of-origin and genotypic classes. These results resolve the DLBCL microenvironment at systems-level resolution and identify opportunities for therapeutic targeting (https://ecotyper.stanford.edu/lymphoma).

Abstract: Summary
SLX4/FANCP is a key Fanconi anemia (FA) protein and a DNA repair scaffold for incision around a DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) by its partner XPF nuclease. The tandem UBZ4 ubiquitin-binding domains of SLX4 are critical for the recruitment of SLX4 to damage sites, likely by binding to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. However, the identity of the ubiquitin E3 ligase that mediates SLX4 recruitment remains unknown. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening with a GFP-tagged N-terminal half of SLX4 (termed SLX4-N), we identify the RNF168 E3 ligase as a critical factor for mitomycin C (MMC)-induced SLX4 foci formation. RNF168 and GFP-SLX4-N colocalize in MMC-induced ubiquitin foci. Accumulation of SLX4-N at psoralen-laser ICL tracks or of endogenous SLX4 at Digoxigenin-psoralen/UVA ICL is dependent on RNF168. Finally, we find that RNF168 is epistatic with SLX4 in promoting MMC tolerance. We conclude that RNF168 is a critical component of the signal transduction that recruits SLX4 to ICL damage.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, changes in weight elicit responses that favor a return to one’s previous weight and promote weight stability. It has been hypothesized that palatable sweet and high-fat foods disturb the defense of body weight, leading to weight gain. We find that increasing sweetness or percent calories from fat increases diet palatability but that only increases in nutritive fat content increase caloric intake and body weight. In a mouse model of overfeeding that activates weight defense, high-fat diets, but not sweetened diets, attenuate the defense of body weight, leading to weight gain. The ability of a palatable, high-fat diet to increase food intake does not require tasting or smelling the food. Instead, the direct infusion of a high-fat diet into the stomach increases the ad libitum intake of less palatable, low-fat food. Post-oral sensing of percent calories from fat modulates feeding behavior to alter weight stability.

Abstract: Summary
ParB-like CTPases mediate the segregation of bacterial chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids. They act as DNA-sliding clamps that are loaded at parS motifs in the centromere of target DNA molecules and spread laterally to form large nucleoprotein complexes serving as docking points for the DNA segregation machinery. Here, we solve crystal structures of ParB in the pre- and post-hydrolysis state and illuminate the catalytic mechanism of nucleotide hydrolysis. Moreover, we identify conformational changes that underlie the CTP- and parS-dependent closure of ParB clamps. The study of CTPase-deficient ParB variants reveals that CTP hydrolysis serves to limit the sliding time of ParB clamps and thus drives the establishment of a well-defined ParB diffusion gradient across the centromere whose dynamics are critical for DNA segregation. These findings clarify the role of the ParB CTPase cycle in partition complex assembly and function and thus advance our understanding of this prototypic CTP-dependent molecular switch.

Abstract: Summary
Localized radiotherapy (RT) induces an immunogenic antitumor response that is in part counterbalanced by activation of immune evasive and tissue remodeling processes, e.g., via upregulation of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). We report that a bifunctional fusion protein that simultaneously inhibits TGF-β and PD-L1, bintrafusp alfa (BA), effectively synergizes with radiotherapy, leading to superior survival in multiple therapy-resistant murine tumor models with poor immune infiltration. The BA + RT (BART) combination increases tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, reprograms the tumor microenvironment, and attenuates RT-induced fibrosis, leading to reconstitution of tumor immunity and regression of spontaneous lung metastases. Consistently, the beneficial effects of BART are in part reversed by depletion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Intriguingly, targeting of the TGF-β trap to PD-L1+ endothelium and the M2/lipofibroblast-like cell compartment by BA attenuated late-stage RT-induced lung fibrosis. Together, the results suggest that the BART combination has the potential to eradicate therapy-resistant tumors while sparing normal tissue, further supporting its clinical translation.

Despite absent expression in normal hematopoiesis, the Forkhead factor FOXC1, a critical mesenchymal differentiation regulator, is highly expressed in ∼30% of HOXAhigh acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases to confer blocked monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Through integrated proteomics and bioinformatics, we find that FOXC1 and RUNX1 interact through Forkhead and Runt domains, respectively, and co-occupy primed and active enhancers distributed close to differentiation genes. FOXC1 stabilizes association of RUNX1, HDAC1, and Groucho repressor TLE3 to limit enhancer activity: FOXC1 knockdown induces loss of repressor proteins, gain of CEBPA binding, enhancer acetylation, and upregulation of nearby genes, including KLF2. Furthermore, it triggers genome-wide redistribution of RUNX1, TLE3, and HDAC1 from enhancers to promoters, leading to repression of self-renewal genes, including MYC and MYB. Our studies highlight RUNX1 and CEBPA transcription factor swapping as a feature of leukemia cell differentiation and reveal that FOXC1 prevents this by stabilizing enhancer binding of a RUNX1/HDAC1/TLE3 transcription repressor complex to oncogenic effect.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare cells that arise in the embryo and sustain adult hematopoiesis. Although the functional potential of nascent HSCs is detectable by transplantation, their native contribution during development is unknown, in part due to the overlapping genesis and marker gene expression with other embryonic blood progenitors. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we define gene signatures that distinguish nascent HSCs from embryonic blood progenitors. Applying a lineage-tracing approach to selectively track HSC output in situ, we find significantly delayed lymphomyeloid contribution. An inducible HSC injury model demonstrates a negligible impact on larval lymphomyelopoiesis following HSC depletion. HSCs are not merely dormant at this developmental stage, as they showed robust regeneration after injury. Combined, our findings illuminate that nascent HSCs self-renew but display differentiation latency, while HSC-independent embryonic progenitors sustain developmental hematopoiesis. Understanding these differences could improve de novo generation and expansion of functional HSCs.

Abstract: Background
We aimed to study the beneficial property of chrysin (CHR) by targeting its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on nephrotoxicity induced by sodium arsenite (SA).
Materials & methods
We have used the 35 male Wistar rats in five equal groups (n = 7). Normal saline in (5 ml/kg; p.o.; 21 days) was given to the control group. Sodium arsenite (10 mg/kg; p.o.; 14 days) was given to the SA group. CHR (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg; p.o.; 21 days) and SA (10 mg/kg; p.o.; 14 days from the 7th day of the experiment) was given to the SA + CHR 25, 50 and 100 groups. On the 22nd day of the experiment, the animals’ bloods and kidneys were taken, and then we have performed functional, biochemical and histological assessment.
Results
CHR pre- and alongside administration (more potently at dose of 100 mg/kg) with SA reduced the SA-induced alterations in serum creatinine and blood urine nitrogen levels. Increased levels of protein carbonyl, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide in kidney tissue were decreased by CHR treatment. CHR administration increased the levels of glutathione and activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in renal tissue. Moreover, treatment with CHR reduced the levels of inflammatory mediators including interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha in renal tissue. The renal histological lesions induced SA were mitigated by CHR treatment in dose dependent manner.
Conclusion
The results of present study suggested that administration of CHR before and alongside with SA attenuated the renal toxic effects of SA via antioxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects.

Abstract: The cytosolic pH decline from 7.2 to 6.9 results in 90% inactivation of mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs) due to protons interactions with regulatory and transport domains (“proton block”). Remarkably, the pH titration curves of mammalian and prokaryotic NCXs significantly differ, even after excluding the allosteric effects through regulatory domains. This is fascinating since “only” three (out of twelve) ion-coordinating residues (T50S, E213D, and D240N) differ between the archaeal NCX_Mj and mammalian NCXs although they contain either three or two carboxylates, respectively. To resolve the underlying mechanisms of pH-dependent regulation, the ion-coordinating residues of NCX_Mj were mutated to imitate the ion ligation arrays of mammalian NCXs; the mutational effects were tested on the ion binding/transport by using ion-flux assays and two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. Our analyses revealed that two deprotonated carboxylates ligate 3Na+ or 1Ca2+ in NCX prototypes with three or two carboxylates. The Na+/Ca2+ exchange rates of NCX_Mj reach saturation at pH 5.0, whereas the Na+/Ca2+ exchange rates of the cardiac NCX1.1 gradually increase even at alkaline pHs. The T50S replacement in NCX_Mj "recapitulates" the pH titration curves of mammalian NCX by instigating an alkaline shift. Proteolytic shaving of regulatory CBD domains activates NCX1.1, although the normalized pH-titration curves are comparable in trypsin treated and untreated NCX1.1. Thus, the T50S-dependent alkaline shift sets a dynamic range for "proton block" function at physiological pH, whereas the CBDs (and other regulatory modes) modulate incremental changes in the transport rates rather than affect the shape of pH dependent curves.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila Vago is a small antiviral peptide. Its ortholog in Culex mosquito was found to be an interferon-like cytokine that limits virus replication through activating Jak/Stat signaling. However, this activation is independent of Domeless, the sole homolog of vertebrate type I cytokine receptor. How Vago activates the Jak/Stat pathway remains unknown. Herein, we report this process is dependent on integrin in kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus). Shrimp Vago-like (MjVago-L) plays an antiviral role by activating the Jak/Stat pathway and inducing Stat-regulated Ficolin. Blocking integrin abrogates the role of MjVago-L. The interaction between MjVago-L and integrin β3 is confirmed. An Asp residue in MjVago-L is found critical for the interaction and MjVago-L’s antiviral role. Moreover, Fak, a key adaptor of integrin signaling, mediates MjVago-L-induced Jak/Stat activation. Therefore, this study reveals that integrin, as the receptor of MjVago-L, mediates Jak/Stat activation. The establishment of the MjVago-L/integrin/Fak/Jak/Stat/Ficolin axis provides insights into antiviral cytokine signaling in invertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
Helitrons are widespread eukaryotic DNA transposons that have significantly contributed to genome variability and evolution, in part because of their distinctive, replicative rolling-circle mechanism, which often mobilizes adjacent genes. Although most eukaryotic transposases form oligomers and use RNase H-like domains to break and rejoin double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), Helitron transposases contain a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-specific HUH endonuclease domain. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Helitron transposase bound to the 5′-transposon end, providing insight into its multidomain architecture and function. The monomeric transposase forms a tightly packed assembly that buries the covalently attached cleaved end, protecting it until the second end becomes available. The structure reveals unexpected architectural similarity to TraI, a bacterial relaxase that also catalyzes ssDNA movement. The HUH active site suggests how two juxtaposed tyrosines, a feature of many replication initiators that use HUH nucleases, couple the conformational shift of an α-helix to control strand cleavage and ligation reactions.

Abstract: Summary
Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) are a target for broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutic agents. Recently, we demonstrated that incorporation of the T-1106 triphosphate, a pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotide, into nascent RNA increases pausing and backtracking by the poliovirus RdRp. Here, by monitoring enterovirus A-71 RdRp dynamics during RNA synthesis using magnetic tweezers, we identify the “backtracked” state as an intermediate used by the RdRp for copy-back RNA synthesis and homologous recombination. Cell-based assays and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments further demonstrate that the pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotide stimulates these processes during infection. These results suggest that pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotides do not induce lethal mutagenesis or chain termination but function by promoting template switching and formation of defective viral genomes. We conclude that RdRp-catalyzed intra- and intermolecular template switching can be induced by pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotides, defining an additional mechanistic class of antiviral ribonucleotides with potential for broad-spectrum activity.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less severe than it is in adults. We perform a longitudinal analysis of the early innate responses in children and adults with mild infection within household clusters. Children display fewer symptoms than adults do, despite similar initial viral load, and mount a robust anti-viral immune signature typical of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterized by early interferon gene responses; increases in cytokines, such as CXCL10 and GM-CSF; and changes in blood cell numbers. When compared with adults, the antiviral response resolves faster (within a week of symptoms), monocytes and dendritic cells are more transiently activated, and genes associated with B cell activation appear earlier in children. Nonetheless, these differences do not have major effects on the quality of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Our findings reveal that better early control of inflammation as observed in children may be key for rapidly controlling infection and limiting the disease course.

Abstract: Summary
AKT is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an important role in metabolism, cell growth, and cytoskeletal dynamics. AKT is activated by two kinases, PDK1 and mTORC2. Although the regulation of PDK1 is well understood, the mechanism that controls mTORC2 is unknown. Here, by investigating insulin receptor signaling in human cells and biochemical reconstitution, we found that insulin induces the activation of mTORC2 toward AKT by assembling a supercomplex with KRAS4B and RHOA GTPases, termed KARATE (KRAS4B-RHOA-mTORC2 Ensemble). Insulin-induced KARATE assembly is controlled via phosphorylation of GTP-bound KRAS4B at S181 and GDP-bound RHOA at S188 by protein kinase A. By developing a KARATE inhibitor, we demonstrate that KRAS4B-RHOA interaction drives KARATE formation. In adipocytes, KARATE controls insulin-dependent translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane for glucose uptake. Thus, our work reveals a fundamental mechanism that activates mTORC2 toward AKT in insulin-regulated glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Immune cells are armed with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for sensing and responding to pathogens and other danger cues. The role of extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) in TLR signaling remains enigmatic, with both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions described. We reveal here that the immune-specific transmembrane adaptor SCIMP is a direct scaffold for Erk1/2 in TLR pathways, with high-resolution, live-cell imaging revealing that SCIMP guides the spatial and temporal recruitment of Erk2 to membrane ruffles and macropinosomes for pro-inflammatory TLR4 signaling. SCIMP-deficient mice display defects in Erk1/2 recruitment to TLR4, c-Fos activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, with these effects being phenocopied by Erk1/2 signaling inhibition. Our findings thus delineate a selective role for SCIMP as a key scaffold for the membrane recruitment of Erk1/2 kinase to initiate TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
The relationship between B cells and CD4 T cells has been carefully studied, revealing a collaborative effort in which B cells promote the activation, differentiation, and expansion of CD4 T cells while the so-called “helper” cells provide signals to B cells, influencing their class switching and fate. Interactions between B cells and CD8 T cells are not as well studied, although CD8 T cells exhibit an accelerated contraction after certain infections in B-cell-deficient mice. Here, we find that B cells significantly enhance primary CD8 T cell responses after vaccination. Moreover, memory CD8 numbers and function are impaired in B-cell-deficient animals, leading to increased susceptibility to bacterial challenge. We also show that interleukin-27 production by B cells contributes to their impact on primary, but not memory, CD8 responses. Better understanding of the interactions between CD8 T cells and B cells may aid in the design of more effective future vaccine strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The human genome encodes tens of thousands circular RNAs (circRNAs) with mostly unknown functions. Circular RNAs require internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) if they are to undergo translation without a 5′ cap. Here, we develop a high-throughput screen to systematically discover RNA sequences that can direct circRNA translation in human cells. We identify more than 17,000 endogenous and synthetic sequences as candidate circRNA IRES. 18S rRNA complementarity and a structured RNA element positioned on the IRES are important for driving circRNA translation. Ribosome profiling and peptidomic analyses show extensive IRES-ribosome association, hundreds of circRNA-encoded proteins with tissue-specific distribution, and antigen presentation. We find that circFGFR1p, a protein encoded by circFGFR1 that is downregulated in cancer, functions as a negative regulator of FGFR1 oncoprotein to suppress cell growth during stress. Systematic identification of circRNA IRES elements may provide important links among circRNA regulation, biological function, and disease.

Abstract: Myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-MY) generate and actively propagate electrical slow waves in the stomach. Slow wave generation and propagation are altered in gastric motor disorders, such as gastroparesis, and the mechanism for the gradient in slow wave frequency that facilitates proximal to distal propagation of slow waves and normal gastric peristalsis is poorly understood.  Slow waves depend upon Ca2+-activated Cl− channels (encoded by Ano1). We characterized Ca2+ signaling in ICC-MY in situ using mice engineered to have cell-specific expression of GCaMP6f in ICC. Ca2+ signaling differed in ICC-MY in corpus and antrum. Localized Ca2+ transients were generated from multiple firing sites and were organized into Ca2+ transient clusters (CTCs). Ca2+ transient refractory periods occurred upon cessation of CTCs, but a relatively higher frequency of Ca2+ transients persisted during the inter-CTC interval in corpus than in antrum ICC-MY. The onset of Ca2+ transients after the refractory period was associated with initiation of the next CTC. Thus, CTCs were initiated at higher frequencies in corpus than in antrum ICC-MY. Initiation and propagation of CTCs (and electrical slow waves) depends upon T-type Ca2+ channels, and durations of CTCs relied upon L-type Ca2+ channels. The durations of CTCs mirrored the durations of slow waves. CTCs and Ca2+ transients between CTCs resulted from release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and were maintained, in part, by store-operated Ca2+ entry. Our data suggest that Ca2+ release and activation of Ano1 channels both initiate and contribute to the plateau phase of slow waves.

Abstract: Free fatty acids are converted to acyl-CoA by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) before entering into metabolic pathways for lipid biosynthesis or degradation. ACSL family members have highly conserved amino acid sequences except for their N-terminal regions. Several reports have shown that ACSL1, among the ACSLs, is located in mitochondria and mainly leads fatty acids to the β-oxidation pathway in various cell types. In this study, we investigated how ACSL1 was localized in mitochondria and whether ACSL1 overexpression affected fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rates in C2C12 myotubes. We generated an ACSL1 mutant in which the N-terminal 100 amino acids were deleted and compared its localization and function with those of the ACSL1 wild type. We found that ACSL1 adjoined the outer membrane of mitochondria through interaction of its N-terminal region with carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1b (CPT1b) in C2C12 myotubes. In addition, overexpressed ACSL1, but not the ACSL1 mutant, increased FAO, and ameliorated palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes. These results suggested that targeting of ACSL1 to mitochondria is essential in increasing FAO in myotubes, which can reduce insulin resistance in obesity and related metabolic disorders.

Abstract: In vertebrate embryos the presomitic mesoderm becomes progressively segmented into somites at the anterior end while extending along the anterior-posterior axis. A commonly adopted model to explain how this tissue elongates is that of posterior growth, driven in part by the addition of new cells from uncommitted progenitor populations in the tailbud. However, in zebrafish, much of somitogenesis is associated with an absence of overall volume increase, and posterior progenitors do not contribute new cells until the final stages of somitogenesis. Here, we perform a comprehensive 3D morphometric analysis of the paraxial mesoderm and reveal that extension is linked to a volumetric decrease and an increase in cell density. We also find that individual cells decrease in volume over successive somite stages. Live cell tracking confirms that much of this tissue deformation occurs within the presomitic mesoderm progenitor zone and is associated with non-directional rearrangement. Taken together, we propose a compaction-extension mechanism of tissue elongation that highlights the need to better understand the role tissue intrinsic and extrinsic forces in regulating morphogenesis.

Abstract: Kinesin family member 2C (KIF2C) has been identified as a potential oncogene in various types of human cancers; however, the role of KIF2C in thyroid cancer has not yet been elucidated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were employed for gene expression analysis. Cell Counting Kit-8 and ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine assays were performed to examine cell proliferation. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by wound-healing and transwell invasion assays. Results showed that KIF2C expression was upregulated in thyroid carcinoma cell lines. In addition, upregulation of KIF2C promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of thyroid carcinoma cells, while downregulation of KIF2C exerted the opposite effects. Overexpression of KIF2C induced the activation of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad signaling in thyroid carcinoma cells. However, inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad signaling through silencing TGF-β1 attenuated the promoting effects of KIF2C overexpression on the malignant phenotype of thyroid carcinoma cells. Besides, overexpression of TGF-β1 suppressed the inhibitory effect of KIF2C knockdown on the proliferation and metastasis of thyroid carcinoma cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that KIF2C contributed to the malignant phenotype of thyroid carcinoma cells by inducing the activation of TGF-β1/Smad signaling, thus uncovering a novel mechanism for thyroid carcinoma progression.

Abstract: Summary
In order to combat molecular damage, most cellular proteins undergo rapid turnover. We have previously identified large nuclear protein assemblies that can persist for years in post-mitotic tissues and are subject to age-related decline. Here, we report that mitochondria can be long lived in the mouse brain and reveal that specific mitochondrial proteins have half-lives longer than the average proteome. These mitochondrial long-lived proteins (mitoLLPs) are core components of the electron transport chain (ETC) and display increased longevity in respiratory supercomplexes. We find that COX7C, a mitoLLP that forms a stable contact site between complexes I and IV, is required for complex IV and supercomplex assembly. Remarkably, even upon depletion of COX7C transcripts, ETC function is maintained for days, effectively uncoupling mitochondrial function from ongoing transcription of its mitoLLPs. Our results suggest that modulating protein longevity within the ETC is critical for mitochondrial proteome maintenance and the robustness of mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Summary
Biological information can be encoded within the dynamics of signaling components, which has been implicated in a broad range of physiological processes including stress response, oncogenesis, and stem cell differentiation. To study the complexity of information transfer across the eukaryotic promoter, we screened 119 dynamic conditions—modulating the pulse frequency, amplitude, and pulse width of light—regulating the binding of an epigenome editor to a fluorescent reporter. This system revealed tunable gene expression and filtering behaviors and provided a quantification of the limit to the amount of information that can be reliably transferred across a single promoter as ∼1.7 bits. Using a library of over 100 orthogonal chromatin regulators, we further determined that chromatin state could be used to tune mutual information and expression levels, as well as completely alter the input-output transfer function of the promoter. This system unlocks the information-rich content of eukaryotic gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multi-factorial chronic intestinal inflammation driven by pathogenic T cells, among which a large portion of patients are resistant to current anti-inflammatory regimes. The mechanisms underlying colitis pathogenicity and drug resistance are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that RORα is highly expressed in active UC patients, particularly in those non-responsive to anti-TNF treatment. Rorα deficiency in CD4+ T cells greatly reduced colitis development. Mechanistically, RORα regulated T cell infiltration in colon and inhibited T cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, genome-wide occupancy and transcriptome analysis revealed that RORα promoted mTORC1 activation. mTORC1 signaling, also hyperactivated in active UC patients, is necessary for T cell-mediated colitis. Our results thus demonstrate a crucial role of the RORα-mTORC1 axis in CD4+ T cells in promoting IBD, which may be targeted in human patients.

Abstract: Summary
Currently favored models for meiotic recombination posit that both noncrossover and crossover recombination are initiated by DNA double-strand breaks but form by different mechanisms: noncrossovers by synthesis-dependent strand annealing and crossovers by formation and resolution of double Holliday junctions centered around the break. This dual mechanism hypothesis predicts different hybrid DNA patterns in noncrossover and crossover recombinants. We show that these predictions are not upheld, by mapping with unprecedented resolution parental strand contributions to recombinants at a model locus. Instead, break repair in both noncrossovers and crossovers involves synthesis-dependent strand annealing, often with multiple rounds of strand invasion. Crossover-specific double Holliday junction formation occurs via processes involving branch migration as an integral feature, one that can be separated from repair of the break itself. These findings reveal meiotic recombination to be a highly dynamic process and prompt a new view of the relationship between crossover and noncrossover recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Pathological hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau (pTau) and neuroinflammation, driven by interleukin-1β (IL-1β), are the major hallmarks of tauopathies. Here, we show that pTau primes and activates IL-1β. First, RNA-sequence analysis suggests paired-helical filaments (PHFs) from human tauopathy brain primes nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), chemokine, and IL-1β signaling clusters in human primary microglia. Treating microglia with pTau-containing neuronal media, exosomes, or PHFs causes IL-1β activation, which is NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 dependent. Suppression of pTau or ASC reduces tau pathology and inflammasome activation in rTg4510 and hTau mice, respectively. Although the deletion of MyD88 prevents both IL-1β expression and activation in the hTau mouse model of tauopathy, ASC deficiency in myeloid cells reduces pTau-induced IL-1β activation and improves cognitive function in hTau mice. Finally, pTau burden co-exists with elevated IL-1β and ASC in autopsy brains of human tauopathies. Together, our results suggest pTau activates IL-1β via MyD88- and NLRP3-ASC-dependent pathways in myeloid cells, including microglia.

Abstract: Summary
BRCA1/2 mutant tumor cells display an elevated mutation burden, the etiology of which remains unclear. Here, we report that these cells accumulate ssDNA gaps and spontaneous mutations during unperturbed DNA replication due to repriming by the DNA primase-polymerase PRIMPOL. Gap accumulation requires the DNA glycosylase SMUG1 and is exacerbated by depletion of the translesion synthesis (TLS) factor RAD18 or inhibition of the error-prone TLS polymerase complex REV1-Polζ by the small molecule JH-RE-06. JH-RE-06 treatment of BRCA1/2-deficient cells results in reduced mutation rates and PRIMPOL- and SMUG1-dependent loss of viability. Through cellular and animal studies, we demonstrate that JH-RE-06 is preferentially toxic toward HR-deficient cancer cells. Furthermore, JH-RE-06 remains effective toward PARP inhibitor (PARPi)-resistant BRCA1 mutant cells and displays additive toxicity with crosslinking agents or PARPi. Collectively, these studies identify a protective and mutagenic role for REV1-Polζ in BRCA1/2 mutant cells and provide the rationale for using REV1-Polζ inhibitors to treat BRCA1/2 mutant tumors.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is caused by the initiation of the thickening and calcification of valve leaflets by valve interstitial cells (VICs). Cell metabolic changes during the CAVD process are a new field of basic research on this disease. The present study aimed to investigate whether andrographolide (AGP) could attenuate the calcification of aortic valves by regulating cell metabolism. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) metabolome analysis was utilized to investigate the changes in the metabolites of VICs from healthy and CAVD samples. Cell growth and the osteogenic differentiation of human VICs (hVICs) were assessed using a CCK8 assay and Alizarin Red S staining, respectively. The expression of two calcification-related markers, RUNX2 and ALP, was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining. Molecular docking was used to detect the interaction between AGP and monoglyceride lipase (MGLL). The high-fat-fed ApoE-/- mice aortic valve calcification animal model was used to verify the effect of AGP on CAVD in vivo. Metabolome analysis showed that the metabolites of VICs from healthy and CAVD samples were highly enriched in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycerolipid metabolism. The top six highlighted metabolites were selected to reveal a high regulation of lipids in VICs from CAVD. AGP significantly suppressed the calcific differentiation of VICs while it decreased the accumulation of the above six metabolites, 1-monopalmitic, palmitic acid, glycerol, l-asparagine, tetraethylene glycol, and stearic acid induced by osteogenic medium (OM) stimulation. These metabolites were highly correlated with the calcific marker ALP and showed a positive correlation with CAVD. In the comprehensive assessment, MGLL, associated with glycerol synthesis, was selected as the molecular target of AGP in inhibiting the calcific phenotype of transforming hVICs. The in vivo results revealed that AGP visibly ameliorated aortic valve calcification by reducing Von Kossa and ALP staining, which was positively correlated with MGLL expression. AGP ameliorated aortic valve calcification by regulating lipid biosynthesis and glycerolipid metabolism targeting MGLL expression in vitro and in vivo. It is a potent therapeutic supplement that prevents the occurrence of heart valve calcification disease by regulating cell metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The normal androgen receptor (AR) cistrome and transcriptional program are fundamentally altered in prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we profile the chromatin landscape and AR-directed transcriptional program in normal prostate cells and show the impact of SPOP mutations, an early event in prostate tumorigenesis. In genetically normal mouse prostate organoids, SPOP mutation results in accessibility and AR binding patterns similar to that of human PCa. Consistent with dependence on AR signaling, castration of SPOP mutant mouse models results in the loss of neoplastic phenotypes, and human SPOP mutant PCa shows a favorable response to AR-targeted therapies. Together, these data validate mouse prostate organoids as a robust model for studying epigenomic and transcriptional alterations in normal prostate, provide valuable datasets for further studies, and show that a single genomic alteration may be sufficient to reprogram the chromatin of normal prostate cells toward oncogenic phenotypes, with potential therapeutic implications for AR-targeting therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Although understanding the diversity of HIV-1 reservoirs is key to achieving a cure, their study at the single-cell level in primary samples remains challenging. We combine flow cytometric multiplexed fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization for different viral genes with HIV-1 p24 protein detection, cell phenotyping, and downstream near-full-length single-cell vDNA sequencing. Stimulation-induced viral RNA-positive (vRNA+) cells from viremic and antiretroviral-therapy (ART)-suppressed individuals differ in their ability to produce p24. In participants on ART, latency-reversing agents (LRAs) induce a wide variety of viral gene transcription and translation patterns with LRA class-specific differences in reactivation potency. Reactivated proviruses, including in p24+ cells, are mostly defective. Although LRAs efficiently induce transcription in all memory cell subsets, we observe induction of translation mostly in effector memory cells, rather than in the long-lived central memory pool. We identify HIV-1 clones with diverse transcriptional and translational patterns between individual cells, and this finding suggests that cell-intrinsic factors influence reservoir persistence and heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is the most common paroxysmal dyskinesia, characterized by recurrent episodes of involuntary movements provoked by sudden changes in movement. Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) has been identified as the major causative gene for PKD. Here, we report that PRRT2 deficiency facilitates the induction of cerebellar spreading depolarization (SD) and inhibition of cerebellar SD prevents the occurrence of dyskinetic movements. Using Ca2+ imaging, we show that cerebellar SD depolarizes a large population of cerebellar granule cells and Purkinje cells in Prrt2-deficient mice. Electrophysiological recordings further reveal that cerebellar SD blocks Purkinje cell spiking and disturbs neuronal firing of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). The resultant aberrant firing patterns in DCN are tightly, temporally coupled to dyskinetic episodes in Prrt2-deficient mice. Cumulatively, our findings uncover a pivotal role of cerebellar SD in paroxysmal dyskinesia, providing a potent target for treating PRRT2-related paroxysmal disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudomonas aeruginosa notoriously adapts to the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), yet how infection-site biogeography and associated evolutionary processes vary as lifelong infections progress remains unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that early adaptations promoting aggregation influence evolutionary-genetic trajectories by examining longitudinal P. aeruginosa from the sinuses of six adults with CF. Highly host-adapted lineages harbored mutator genotypes displaying signatures of early genome degradation associated with recent host restriction. Using an advanced imaging technique (MiPACT-HCR [microbial identification after passive clarity technique]), we find population structure tracks with genome degradation, with the most host-adapted, genome-degraded P. aeruginosa (the mutators) residing in small, sparse aggregates. We propose that following initial adaptive evolution in larger populations under strong selection for aggregation, P. aeruginosa persists in small, fragmented populations that experience stronger effects of genetic drift. These conditions enrich for mutators and promote degenerative genome evolution. Our findings underscore the importance of infection-site biogeography to pathogen evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Subtype C is the most prevalent clade of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) worldwide. The reasons for this are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a characteristic additional third nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) binding site in the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter allows subtype C HIV-1 strains to evade restriction by nuclear PYHIN proteins, which sequester the transcription factor Sp1. Further, other LTR alterations are responsible for rare PYHIN resistance of subtype B viruses. Resistance-conferring mutations generally reduce the dependency of HIV-1 on Sp1 for virus production and render LTR transcription highly responsive to stimulation by NF-κB/p65. A third NF-κB binding site increases infectious virus yield in primary CD4+ T cells in an γ-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16)-dependent manner. Comprehensive sequence analyses suggest that the frequency of circulating PYHIN-resistant HIV-1 strains is increasing. Our finding that an additional NF-κB binding site in the LTR confers resistance to nuclear PYHIN proteins helps to explain the dominance of clade C HIV-1 strains.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammasomes are crucial for innate immunity against infections and, when deregulated, also contribute to inflammatory diseases. Here, we identify a critical function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Peli1 in regulating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Peli1 deficiency impairs induction of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion by different NLRP3 inducers, but not by inducers of the Aim2, NLRP1, and NLRC4 inflammasomes. Peli1-deficient mice have alleviated peritonitis induction by alum and display increased resistance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin shock, coupled with decreased serum concentration of IL-1β. Peli1 is required for NLRP3-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β maturation. Mechanistically, Peli1 conjugates K63 ubiquitin chain to lysine 55 of the inflammasome adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), which in turn facilitates ASC/NLRP3 interaction and ASC oligomerization, thereby contributing to inflammasome activation. Peli1 deficiency impairs the ubiquitination of ASC and inhibits inflammasome activation. Our findings establish Peli1 as an important inflammasome regulator and suggest a mechanism by which Peli1 mediates inflammatory responses.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial dynamics regulated by mitochondrial fusion and fission maintain mitochondrial functions, whose alterations underline various human diseases. Here, we show that inositol is a critical metabolite directly restricting AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission independently of its classical mode as a precursor for phosphoinositide generation. Inositol decline by IMPA1/2 deficiency elicits AMPK activation and mitochondrial fission without affecting ATP level, whereas inositol accumulation prevents AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission. Metabolic stress or mitochondrial damage causes inositol decline in cells and mice to elicit AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission. Inositol directly binds to AMPKγ and competes with AMP for AMPKγ binding, leading to restriction of AMPK activation and mitochondrial fission. Our study suggests that the AMP/inositol ratio is a critical determinant for AMPK activation and establishes a model in which AMPK activation requires inositol decline to release AMPKγ for AMP binding. Hence, AMPK is an inositol sensor, whose inactivation by inositol serves as a mechanism to restrict mitochondrial fission.

Abstract: Summary
In holometabolous insects, metamorphic timing and body size are controlled by a neuroendocrine axis composed of the ecdysone-producing prothoracic gland (PG) and its presynaptic neurons (PGNs) producing PTTH. Although PTTH/Torso signaling is considered the primary mediator of metamorphic timing, recent studies indicate that other unidentified PGN-derived factors also affect timing. Here, we demonstrate that the receptor tyrosine kinases anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) and PDGF and VEGF receptor-related (Pvr), function in coordination with PTTH/Torso signaling to regulate pupariation timing and body size. Both Alk and Pvr trigger Ras/Erk signaling in the PG to upregulate expression of ecdysone biosynthetic enzymes, while Alk also suppresses autophagy by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. The Alk ligand Jelly belly (Jeb) is produced by the PGNs and serves as a second PGN-derived tropic factor, while Pvr activation mainly relies on autocrine signaling by PG-derived Pvf2 and Pvf3. These findings illustrate that a combination of juxtacrine and autocrine signaling regulates metamorphic timing, the defining event of holometabolous development.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) possesses glioma stem cells (GSCs) that promote self-renewal, tumor propagation, and relapse. Understanding the mechanisms of GSCs self-renewal can offer targeted therapeutic interventions. However, insufficient knowledge of GSCs’ fundamental biology is a significant bottleneck hindering these efforts. Here, we show that patient-derived GSCs recruit elevated levels of proteins that ensure the temporal cilium disassembly, leading to suppressed ciliogenesis. Depleting the cilia disassembly complex components is sufficient to induce ciliogenesis in a subset of GSCs via relocating platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-α) to a newly induced cilium. Importantly, restoring ciliogenesis enabled GSCs to switch from self-renewal to differentiation. Finally, using an organoid-based glioma invasion assay and brain xenografts in mice, we establish that ciliogenesis-induced differentiation can prevent the infiltration of GSCs into the brain. Our findings illustrate a role for cilium as a molecular switch in determining GSCs’ fate and suggest cilium induction as an attractive strategy to intervene in GSCs proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of lipid homeostasis is not well understood. Using forward genetic screening, we demonstrate that the loss of dTBC1D22, an essential gene that encodes a Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing protein, results in lipid droplet accumulation in multiple tissues. We observe that dTBC1D22 interacts with Rab40 and exhibits GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity. Overexpression of either the GTP- or GDP-binding-mimic form of Rab40 results in lipid droplet accumulation. We observe that Rab40 mutant flies are defective in lipid mobilization. The lipid depletion induced by overexpression of Brummer, a triglyceride lipase, is dependent on Rab40. Rab40 mutant flies exhibit decreased lipophagy and small size of autolysosomal structures, which may be due to the defective Golgi functions. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab40 physically interacts with Lamp1, and Rab40 is required for the distribution of Lamp1 during starvation. We propose that dTBC1D22 functions as a GAP for Rab40 to regulate lipophagy.

Abstract: Summary
PBRM1, a subunit of the PBAF coactivator complex that transcription factors use to activate target genes, is genetically inactivated in almost all clear cell renal cell cancers (RCCs). Using unbiased proteomic analyses, we find that PAX8, a master transcription factor driver of proximal tubule epithelial fates, recruits PBRM1/PBAF. Reverse analyses of the PAX8 interactome confirm recruitment specifically of PBRM1/PBAF and not functionally similar BAF. More conspicuous in the PAX8 hub in RCC cells, however, are corepressors, which functionally oppose coactivators. Accordingly, key PAX8 target genes are repressed in RCC versus normal kidneys, with the loss of histone lysine-27 acetylation, but intact lysine-4 trimethylation, activation marks. Re-introduction of PBRM1, or depletion of opposing corepressors using siRNA or drugs, redress coregulator imbalance and release RCC cells to terminal epithelial fates. These mechanisms thus explain RCC resemblance to the proximal tubule lineage but with suppression of the late-epithelial program that normally terminates lineage-precursor proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Acute ischemic stroke damages the regional brain blood vessel (BV) network. Acute recovery of basic blood flows, which is carried out by the earliest regenerated BVs, are critical to improve clinical outcomes and minimize lethality. Although the late-regenerated BVs form via growing along the meninge-derived ingrown lymphatic vessels (iLVs), mechanisms underlying the early, acute BV regeneration remain elusive. Using zebrafish cerebrovascular injury models, we show that the earliest regenerated BVs come from lymphatic transdifferentiation, a hitherto unappreciated process in vertebrates. Mechanistically, the LV-to-BV transdifferentiation occurs exclusively in the stand-alone iLVs through Notch activation. In the track iLVs adhered by late-regenerated BVs, transdifferentiation never occurs because the BV-expressing EphrinB2a paracellularly activates the iLV-expressing EphB4a to inhibit Notch activation. Suppression of LV-to-BV transdifferentiation blocks acute BV regeneration and becomes lethal. These results demonstrate that acute BV regeneration occurs via lymphatic transdifferentiation, suggesting this process and key regulatory molecules EphrinB2a/EphB4a/Notch as new postischemic therapeutic targets.

Abstract: The fungal cell wall serves as the interface between the organism and its environment. Complex carbohydrates are a major component of the Candida albicans cell wall, i.e., glucan, mannan and chitin. β-Glucan is a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) composed of β-(1 → 3,1 → 6)-linked glucopyranosyl repeat units. This PAMP plays a key role in fungal structural integrity and immune recognition. Glycogen is an α-(1 → 4,1 → 6)-linked glucan that is an intracellular energy storage carbohydrate. We observed that glycogen was co-extracted during the isolation of β-glucan from C. albicans SC5314. We hypothesized that glucan and glycogen may form a macromolecular species that links intracellular glycogen with cell wall β-(1 → 3,1 → 6)-glucan. To test this hypothesis, we examined glucan-glycogen extracts by multi-dimensional NMR to ascertain if glycogen and β-glucan were interconnected. 1H NMR analyses confirmed the presence of glycogen and β-glucan in the macromolecule. Diffusion Ordered SpectroscopY (DOSY) confirmed that the β-glucan and glycogen co-diffuse, which indicates a linkage between the two polymers. We determined that the linkage is not via peptides and/or small proteins. Our data indicate that glycogen is covalently linked to β-(1 → 3,1 → 6) glucan via the β -(1 → 6)-linked side chain. We also found that the glucan-glycogen complex was present in C. dublinensis, C. haemulonii and C. auris, but was not present in C. glabrata or C. albicans hyphal glucan. These data demonstrate that glucan and glycogen form a novel macromolecular complex in the cell wall of C. albicans and other Candida species. This new and unique structure expands our understanding of the cell wall in Candida species.

Abstract: Summary
The PSMB11 proteasomal subunit, expressed only in cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs), is essential for the development of functional CD8+ T cells. An attractive yet unproven theory holds that PSMB11 generates unique major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I)-associated peptides required for positive selection. We recently reported that PSMB11 regulates the expression of hundreds of genes in cTECs, mainly by differential proteolysis of transcription factors. Thereby, PSMB11 maintains the distinctness of cTECs relative to medullary TECs (mTECs) and promotes cortex-to-medulla migration of developing thymocytes. These conclusions have been challenged by Ohigashi and colleagues, who suggest that their data show that PSMB11 uniquely controls antigen presentation without affecting cTEC biology. Here, we perform a comprehensive reanalysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data from the Ohigashi lab and confirm our original conclusions. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Ohigashi et al. (2019), published in Cell Reports. See also the response by Ohigashi and Takahama (2021), published in this issue of Cell Reports.

Abstract: Summary
Cognition depends on rapid and robust communication between neural circuits spanning different brain areas. We investigated the mesoscopic network of cortico-cortical interactions in the human brain in an extensive dataset consisting of 6,024 h of intracranial field potential recordings from 4,142 electrodes in 48 subjects. We evaluated communication between brain areas at the network level across different frequency bands. The interaction networks were validated against known anatomical measurements and neurophysiological interactions in humans and monkeys. The resulting human brain interactome is characterized by a broad and spatially specific, dynamic, and extensive network. The physiological interactome reveals small-world properties, which we conjecture might facilitate efficient and reliable information transmission. The interaction dynamics correlate with the brain sleep/awake state. These results constitute initial steps toward understanding how the interactome orchestrates cortical communication and provide a reference for future efforts assessing how dysfunctional interactions may lead to mental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Cachexia, the wasting syndrome commonly observed in advanced cancer patients, accounts for up to one-third of cancer-related mortalities. We have established a Drosophila larval model of organ wasting whereby epithelial overgrowth in eye-antennal discs leads to wasting of the adipose tissue and muscles. The wasting is associated with fat-body remodeling and muscle detachment and is dependent on tumor-secreted matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1). Mmp1 can both modulate TGFβ signaling in the fat body and disrupt basement membrane (BM)/extracellular matrix (ECM) protein localization in both the fat body and the muscle. Inhibition of TGFβ signaling or Mmps in the fat body/muscle using a QF2-QUAS binary expression system rescues muscle wasting in the presence of tumor. Altogether, our study proposes that tumor-derived Mmps are central mediators of organ wasting in cancer cachexia.

Abstract: Spemann organizer is a center of dorsal mesoderm and itself retains the mesoderm character, but it has a stimulatory role for neighboring ectoderm cells in becoming neuroectoderm in gastrula embryos. Goosecoid (Gsc) overexpression in ventral region promotes secondary axis formation including neural tissues, but the role of gsc in neural specification could be indirect. We examined the neural inhibitory and stimulatory roles of gsc in the same cell and neighboring cells contexts. In the animal cap explant system, Gsc overexpression inhibited expression of neural specific genes including foxd4l1.1, zic3, ncam, and neurod. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and promoter analysis of early neural genes of foxd4l1.1 and zic3 were performed to show that the neural inhibitory mode of gsc was direct. Site-directed mutagenesis and serially deleted construct studies of foxd4l1.1 promoter revealed that Gsc directly binds within the foxd4l1.1 promoter to repress its expression. Conjugation assay of animal cap explants was also performed to demonstrate an indirect neural stimulatory role for gsc. The genes for secretory molecules, Chordin and Noggin, were up-regulated in gsc injected cells with the neural fate only achieved in gsc uninjected neighboring cells. These experiments suggested that gsc regulates neuroectoderm formation negatively when expressed in the same cell and positively in neighboring cells via soluble factors. One is a direct suppressive circuit of neural genes in gsc expressing mesoderm cells and the other is an indirect stimulatory circuit for neurogenesis in neighboring ectoderm cells via secreted BMP antagonizers.

Abstract: Cellular processes are initiated and regulated by different stimuli, including mechanical forces. Cell membrane mechanosensors represent the first step towards the conversion of mechanical stimuli to a biochemical or electrical response. Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels form a growing family of ion gating channels that respond to direct physical force or plasma membrane deformations. A number of calcium (Ca2+) permeable MS channels are known to regulate the initiation, direction, and persistence of cell migration during development and tumour progression. While the evidence that links individual MS ion channels to cell migration is growing, a unified analysis of the molecular mechanisms regulated downstream of MS ion channel activation is lacking. In this review, we describe the MS ion channel families known to regulate cell migration. We discuss the molecular mechanisms that act downstream of MS ion channels with an emphasis on Ca2+ mediated processes. Finally, we propose the future directions and impact of MS ion channel activity in the field of cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribose (ADPr) readers are essential components of ADP-ribosylation signaling, which regulates genome maintenance and immunity. The identification and discrimination between monoADPr (MAR) and polyADPr (PAR) readers is difficult because of a lack of suitable affinity-enrichment reagents. We synthesized well-defined ADPr probes and used these for affinity purifications combined with relative and absolute quantitative mass spectrometry to generate proteome-wide MAR and PAR interactomes, including determination of apparent binding affinities. Among the main findings, MAR and PAR readers regulate various common and distinct processes, such as the DNA-damage response, cellular metabolism, RNA trafficking, and transcription. We monitored the dynamics of PAR interactions upon induction of oxidative DNA damage and uncovered the mechanistic connections between ubiquitin signaling and ADP-ribosylation. Taken together, chemical biology enables exploration of MAR and PAR readers using interaction proteomics. Furthermore, the generated MAR and PAR interaction maps significantly expand our current understanding of ADPr signaling.

Abstract: We previously described that cell-wide cytosolic Ca2+ transients evoked by inositol trisphosphate (IP3) are generated by two modes of Ca2+ liberation from the ER; ‘punctate’ release via an initial flurry of transient Ca2+ puffs from local clusters of IP3 receptors, succeeded by a spatially and temporally ‘diffuse’ Ca2+ liberation. Those findings were derived using statistical fluctuation analysis to monitor puff activity which is otherwise masked as global Ca2+ levels rise. Here, we devised imaging approaches to resolve individual puffs during global Ca2+ elevations to better investigate the mechanisms terminating the puff flurry. We find that puffs contribute about 40% (∼90 attomoles) of the total Ca2+ liberation, largely while the global Ca2+ signal rises halfway to its peak. The major factor terminating punctate Ca2+ release is an abrupt decline in puff frequency. Although the amplitudes of large puffs fall during the flurry, the amplitudes of more numerous small puffs remain steady, so overall puff amplitudes decline only modestly (∼30%). The Ca2+ flux through individual IP3 receptor/channels does not measurably decline during the flurry, or when puff activity is depressed by pharmacological lowering of Ca2+ levels in the ER lumen, indicating that the termination of punctate release is not a simple consequence of reduced driving force for Ca2+ liberation. We propose instead that the gating of IP3 receptors at puff sites is modulated such that their openings become suppressed as the bulk [Ca2+] in the ER lumen falls during global Ca2+ signals.

Abstract: Morphogenesis depends crucially on the complex rheological properties of cell tissues and on their ability to maintain mechanical integrity while rearranging at long times. In this paper, we study the rheology of polygonal cellular networks described by a vertex model in the presence of fluctuations. We use a triangulation method to decompose shear into cell shape changes and cell rearrangements. Considering the steady-state stress under constant shear, we observe nonlinear shear-thinning behavior at all magnitudes of the fluctuations, and an even stronger nonlinear regime at lower values of the fluctuations. We successfully capture this nonlinear rheology by a mean-field model that describes the tissue in terms of cell elongation and cell rearrangements. We furthermore introduce anisotropic active stresses in the vertex model and analyze their effect on rheology. We include this anisotropy in the mean-field model and show that it recapitulates the behavior observed in the simulations. Our work clarifies how tissue rheology is related to stochastic cell rearrangements and provides a simple biophysical model to describe biological tissues. Further, it highlights the importance of nonlinearities when discussing tissue mechanics.

Abstract: Summary
Teriparatide is the most widely prescribed bone anabolic drug in the world, but its cellular targets remain incompletely defined. The Gli1+ metaphyseal mesenchymal progenitors (MMPs) are a main source for osteoblasts in postnatal growing mice, but their potential response to teriparatide is unknown. Here, by lineage tracing, we show that teriparatide stimulates both proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of MMPs. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals heterogeneity among MMPs, including an unexpected chondrocyte-like osteoprogenitor (COP). COP expresses the highest level of Hedgehog (Hh) target genes and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) among all cell clusters. COP also expresses Pth1r and further upregulates Igf1r upon teriparatide treatment. Inhibition of Hh signaling or deletion of Igf1r from MMPs diminishes the proliferative and osteogenic effects of teriparatide. The study therefore identifies COP as a teriparatide target wherein Hh and insulin-like growth factor (Igf) signaling are critical for the osteoanabolic response in growing mice.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor family-related protein (GITR) is a critical regulatory molecule in modulation of T cell immune responses. Here we report the mouse GITR (mGITR) and mGITR ligand (mGITRL) complex structure and find that the binding interface of mGITR and mGITRL is distinct from the typical tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF)/TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) members. mGITR binds to its ligand with a single domain, whereas the binding interface on mGITRL is located on the side, which is distal from conserved binding sites of TNFSF molecules. Mutational analysis reveals that the binding interface of GITR/GITRL in humans is conserved with that in the mouse. Substitution of key interacting D93-I94-V95 (DIV) in mGITR with the corresponding K93-F94-S95 (KFS) in human GITR enables cross-recognition with human GITRL and cross-activation of receptor signaling. The findings of this study substantially expand our understanding of the interaction of TNFSF/TNFRSF superfamily molecules and can benefit the future design of biologics by targeting GITR/GITRL.

Abstract: Summary
The principles guiding the diurnal organization of biological pathways remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we perturb the hepatic transcriptome through nutrient regulators (high-fat diet and mTOR signaling components) to identify enduring properties of pathway organization. Temporal separation and counter-regulation between pathways of energy metabolism and inflammation/proliferation emerge as persistent transcriptome features across animal models, and network analysis identifies the G0s2 and Rgs16 genes as potential mediators at the metabolism-inflammation interface. Mechanistically, G0s2 and Rgs16 are sequentially induced during the light phase, promoting amino acid oxidation and suppressing overall mitochondrial respiration. In their absence, sphingolipids and diacylglycerides accumulate, accompanied by hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte proliferation. Notably, the expression of G0s2 and Rgs16 is further induced in obese mouse livers, and silencing of their expression accentuates hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, diurnal regulation of energy metabolism alleviates inflammatory and proliferative stresses under physiological and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the tremendous success of targeted and conventional therapies for lung cancer, therapeutic resistance is a common and major clinical challenge. RNF8 is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that plays essential roles in the DNA damage response; however, its role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer is unclear. Here, we report that RNF8 is overexpressed in lung cancer and positively correlates with the expression of p-Akt and poor survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. In addition, we identify RNF8 as the E3 ligase for regulating the activation of Akt by K63-linked ubiquitination under physiological and genotoxic conditions, which leads to lung cancer cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy. Together, our study suggests that RNF8 could be a very promising target in precision medicine for lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
CD4 T cells are essential for immunity to tuberculosis because they produce cytokines, including interferon-γ. Whether CD4 T cells act as “helper” cells to promote optimal CD8 T cell responses during Mycobacterium tuberculosis is unknown. Using two independent models, we show that CD4 T cell help enhances CD8 effector functions and prevents CD8 T cell exhaustion. We demonstrate synergy between CD4 and CD8 T cells in promoting the survival of infected mice. Purified helped, but not helpless, CD8 T cells efficiently restrict intracellular bacterial growth in vitro. Thus, CD4 T cell help plays an essential role in generating protective CD8 T cell responses against M. tuberculosis infection in vitro and in vivo. We infer vaccines that elicit both CD4 and CD8 T cells are more likely to be successful than vaccines that elicit only CD4 or CD8 T cells.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication timing and three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are associated with distinct epigenome patterns across large domains. However, whether alterations in the epigenome, in particular cancer-related DNA hypomethylation, affects higher-order levels of genome architecture is still unclear. Here, using Repli-Seq, single-cell Repli-Seq, and Hi-C, we show that genome-wide methylation loss is associated with both concordant loss of replication timing precision and deregulation of 3D genome organization. Notably, we find distinct disruption in 3D genome compartmentalization, striking gains in cell-to-cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of allelic replication timing in cancer hypomethylation models, potentially through the gene deregulation of DNA replication and genome organization pathways. Finally, we identify ectopic H3K4me3-H3K9me3 domains from across large hypomethylated domains, where late replication is maintained, which we purport serves to protect against catastrophic genome reorganization and aberrant gene transcription. Our results highlight a potential role for the methylome in the maintenance of 3D genome regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms by which androgens signal through the androgen receptor (AR) to maintain male fertility are poorly understood. Transgenic mice were produced expressing mutant ARs that can only (1) alter gene transcription through the classical response pathway (AR-C) or (2) activate kinase signaling cascades via the nonclassical pathway (AR-NC). AR-C is sufficient to produce sperm and fertility. Haploid germ cell production, the blood-testis barrier, and spermatid migration are supported by AR-NC. Gene expression essential for chromosome synapsis during meiosis requires AR-C. We identify targets of androgen signaling required for male fertility and provide a mechanistic explanation for meiotic germ cell arrest in the absence of androgen signaling. Prostate differentiation occurs with AR-C alone, but full development requires synergistic nonclassical signaling. Both AR signaling pathways are necessary for normal male reproductive tract development and function, validating our mouse models for studies of AR functions in other target tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Heart rate has natural fluctuations that are typically ascribed to autonomic function. Recent evidence suggests that conscious processing can affect the timing of the heartbeat. We hypothesized that heart rate is modulated by conscious processing and therefore dependent on attentional focus. To test this, we leverage the observation that neural processes synchronize between subjects by presenting an identical narrative stimulus. As predicted, we find significant inter-subject correlation of heart rate (ISC-HR) when subjects are presented with an auditory or audiovisual narrative. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that ISC-HR is reduced when subjects are distracted from the narrative, and higher ISC-HR predicts better recall of the narrative. Finally, patients with disorders of consciousness have lower ISC-HR, as compared to healthy individuals. We conclude that heart rate fluctuations are partially driven by conscious processing, depend on attentional state, and may represent a simple metric to assess conscious state in unresponsive patients.

Abstract: Summary
Scant understanding of the glioblastoma microenvironment and molecular bases hampers development of efficient treatment strategies. Analyses of gene signatures of human gliomas demonstrate that the SETD2 mutation is correlated with poor prognosis of IDH1/2 wild-type (IDH-WT) adult glioblastoma patients. To better understand the crosstalk between SETD2 mutant (SETD2-mut) glioblastoma cells and the tumor microenvironment, we leverage single-cell transcriptomics to comprehensively map cellular populations in glioblastoma. In this study, we identify a specific subtype of high-grade glioma-associated microglia (HGG-AM). Further analysis shows that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 derived from SETD2-mut/IDH-WT tumor cells activates HGG-AM, exhibiting pro-inflammation and proliferation signatures. Particularly, HGG-AM secretes interleukin (IL)-1β via the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated NLRP1 inflammasome, thereby promoting tumor progression. HGG-AM present extensive proliferation and infiltration to supplement the activated microglia pool. Notably, TGF-β1/TβRI depletion dramatically reduces HGG-AM density and suppresses tumor growth. Altogether, our studies identify a specific microglia subpopulation and establish the cellular basis of interactions between HGG-AM and glioblastoma cells.

Abstract: Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) are a transient population in the embryo, closely associated with nerves along which they migrate into the periphery of the body. Long considered to be progenitors that only form Schwann cells—the myelinating cells of nerves, current evidence suggests that SCPs have much broader developmental potential. Indeed, different cell marking techniques employed over the past 20 years have identified multiple novel SCP derivatives throughout the body. It is now clear that SCPs represent a multipotent progenitor population, which also display a level of plasticity in response to injury. Moreover, they originate from multiple origins in the embryo and may reflect several distinct subpopulations in terms of molecular identity and fate. Here we review SCP origins, derivatives and plasticity in development, growth and repair.

Abstract: S100A6 is a Ca2+-binding protein belonging to the S100 family. Many reports indicate that S100A6 is involved in actin filament organization, however the mechanism of S100A6 action in this process is not fully understood. By screening S100A6 binding partners in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, we have found that S100A6 binds cofilin-1, a protein required for the dynamics of actin polymerization and depolymerization. By applying various biochemical and cell biology assays, we have shown that S100A6 bound to cofilin-1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and increased cofilin-1 affinity for F-actin. Microscopic analysis indicated that S100A6 significantly decreased severing of the actin filaments induced by cofilin-1. Moreover, in the presence of cofilin-1, S100A6 stabilized the filaments by inhibiting their depolymerization. When S100A6 was present at sub-stoichiometric concentrations in relation to actin, polymerization of G-actin accelerated by cofilin-1 was increased. At higher S100A6:actin ratios the polymerization rate was decreased. Altogether, these results show that S100A6 regulates actin filament dynamics by controlling activity of cofilin-1 and suggest that this regulation is Ca2+ -dependent.

Abstract: Summary
Germline development is sensitive to nutrient availability and environmental perturbation. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), a key transcription factor driving the cellular heat shock response (HSR), is also involved in gametogenesis. The precise function of HSF1 (HSF-1 in C. elegans) and its regulation in germline development are poorly understood. Using the auxin-inducible degron system in C. elegans, we uncovered a role of HSF-1 in progenitor cell proliferation and early meiosis and identified a compact but important transcriptional program of HSF-1 in germline development. Interestingly, heat stress only induces the canonical HSR in a subset of germ cells but impairs HSF-1 binding at its developmental targets. Conversely, insulin/insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling dictates the requirement for HSF-1 in germline development and functions through repressing FOXO/DAF-16 in the soma to activate HSF-1 in germ cells. We propose that this non-cell-autonomous mechanism couples nutrient-sensing insulin/IGF-1 signaling to HSF-1 activation to support homeostasis in rapid germline growth.

Abstract: The transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6) channel is highly Ca2+-selective and has been implicated in mediating transcellular Ca2+ transport and thus maintaining the Ca2+ balance in the body. To characterize its physiological function(s), a detailed expression profile of the TRPV6 channel throughout the body is essential. Capitalizing on a recently established murine Trpv6-reporter strain, we identified primary TRPV6 channel-expressing cells in an organism-wide manner. In a complementary experimental approach, we characterized TRPV6 expression in different tissues of wild-type mice by TRPV6 immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass spectrometry analysis and correlated these data with the reporter gene expression. Taken together, we present a TRPV6 expression atlas throughout the entire body of juvenile and adult mice, providing a novel resource to investigate the role of TRPV6 channels in vivo.

Abstract: We have examined published transmission electron microscopy (TEM). photomicrographs of chromatin condensation patterning in developing sperm nuclei from five species of entognathous hexapods within the Classes Protura, Collembola, Diplura and five species of ancestral wingless insects in the Orders Archaeognatha and Zygentoma as well as in fifteen species of the winged insects. Each species reproduces by internal fertilization. Spatially quantitative analysis indicates that spermiogenic chromatin condensation patterning in several of these species may be due to spinodal decomposition (SD) or to microemulsion inversion (chromatin-in-nucleoplasm → nucleoplasm-in-chromatin), also known as nucleation (Nc). These are two different dynamic mechanisms of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). They might either occur independently or co-exist during the chromatin condensation associated with insect spermiogenesis. For example, the chromatin condensation pattern such as that observed in transverse sections of developing sperm nuclei from the wingless insect Anurida maritima (Collembola) is: granules → fibers → lamellae (SD) → nucleation (Nc) → condensed nuclei. Similar transitions are also observed in other more recently evolved species within the Class Insecta. From the limited but comprehensive sample of entognathus and ectognathus hexapods analyzed here, it appears that LLPS of sperm chromatin during spermiogenesis has occurred quite pervasively within the subphylum Hexapoda, including insects.

Abstract: Summary
Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease, but disease flares typically affect only a subset of joints, distributed in a distinctive pattern for each patient. Pursuing this intriguing pattern, we show that arthritis recurrence is mediated by long-lived synovial resident memory T cells (TRM). In three murine models, CD8+ cells bearing TRM markers remain in previously inflamed joints during remission. These cells are bona fide TRM, exhibiting a failure to migrate between joints, preferential uptake of fatty acids, and long-term residency. Disease flares result from TRM activation by antigen, leading to CCL5-mediated recruitment of circulating effector cells. Correspondingly, TRM depletion ameliorates recurrence in a site-specific manner. Human rheumatoid arthritis joint tissues contain a comparable CD8+-predominant TRM population, which is most evident in late-stage leukocyte-poor synovium, exhibiting limited T cell receptor diversity and a pro-inflammatory transcriptomic signature. Together, these findings establish synovial TRM as a targetable mediator of disease chronicity in autoimmune arthritis.

Abstract: Summary
The selection of B cells (BCs) in germinal centers (GCs) is pivotal to the generation of high-affinity antibodies and memory BCs, but it lacks global understanding. Based on the idea of a single Tfh-cell signal that controls BC selection and division, experiments appear contradictory. Here, we use the current knowledge on the molecular pathways of GC BCs to develop a theory of GC BC selection and division based on the dynamics of molecular factors. This theory explains the seemingly contradictory experiments by the separation of signals for BC fate decision from signals controlling the number of BC divisions. Three model variants are proposed and experiments are predicted that allow one to distinguish those. Understanding information processing in molecular BC states is critical for targeted immune interventions, and the proposed theory implies that selection and division can be controlled independently in GC reactions.

Abstract: Summary
Secretory cargos are collected at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites (ERES) before transport to the Golgi apparatus. Decades of research have provided many details of the molecular events underlying ER-Golgi exchanges. Essential questions, however, remain about the organization of the ER-Golgi interface in cells and the type of membrane structures mediating traffic from ERES. To investigate these, we use transgenic tagging in Drosophila flies, 3D-structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to characterize ERES-Golgi units in collagen-producing fat body, imaginal discs, and imaginal discs overexpressing ERES determinant Tango1. Facing ERES, we find a pre-cis-Golgi region, equivalent to the vertebrate ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), involved in both anterograde and retrograde transport. This pre-cis-Golgi is continuous with the rest of the Golgi, not a separate compartment or collection of large carriers, for which we find no evidence. We observe, however, many vesicles, as well as pearled tubules connecting ERES and Golgi.

Abstract: Summary
Radiotherapy is inevitably intertwined with various side effects impairing the quality of life of cancer patients. Here, we report the possibility that alterations of the oral microbiota influence the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases that pathologically disrupt gastrointestinal integrity and function. 16S rRNA sequencing shows that oral microbiota alterations change the gut bacterial composition within tumors but not in adjacent peritumor tissues in CRC mouse models. Specifically, buccal Fusobacterium nucleatum migrates to the CRC locus and impairs the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of radiotherapy. Administration of a specific antibiotic, metronidazole, abrogates the adverse effects of oral microbiome fluctuation on radiotherapy for CRC. The oral microbiota were also associated with radiation-induced intestinal injury via intestinal microbes. Our findings demonstrate that the oral microbiome in synergy with its intestinal counterparts impinges on the efficacy and prognosis of radiotherapy for CRC.

Abstract: Summary
To maintain secretory pathway fidelity, misfolded proteins are commonly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and selected for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Soluble misfolded proteins use ER chaperones for retention, but the machinery that restricts aberrant membrane proteins to the ER is unclear. In fact, some misfolded membrane proteins escape the ER and traffic to the lysosome/vacuole. To this end, we describe a model substrate, SZ∗, that contains an ER export signal but is also targeted for ERAD. We observe decreased ER retention when chaperone-dependent SZ∗ ubiquitination is compromised. In addition, appending a linear tetra-ubiquitin motif onto SZ∗ overrides ER export. By screening known ubiquitin-binding proteins, we then positively correlate SZ∗ retention with Ubx2 binding. Deletion of Ubx2 also inhibits the retention of another misfolded membrane protein. Our results indicate that polyubiquitination is sufficient to retain misfolded membrane proteins in the ER prior to ERAD.

Abstract: Summary
The interrelation between hypoxia and immune response has pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of chronic metabolic diseases. However, the role of macrophage HIF-2α in NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. Here, we show that deficiency of HIF-2α in macrophages results in excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a manner dependent on CPT1A-mediated enhancement of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Mechanistically, HIF-2α binds directly to the Cpt1a promoter and is involved in the regulation of H3K27me3 methylation during NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Myeloid-specific Hif2α knockout mice exhibit exacerbated insulin resistance and increased activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. Overexpression of the Hif2α gene or stabilization of the protein by FG-4592 ameliorates insulin resistance and reduces NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Taken together, our results suggest that macrophage HIF-2α inhibits FAO-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and alleviates insulin resistance.

Abstract: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common disorder in women, and it is characterized by weakening of pelvic supportive structure with extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was upregulated in anterior vaginal wall tissues of POP patients. We hypothesized that upregulation of ATF3 might contribute to POP development. This study aims to unveil the role of ATF3 in the pathogenesis of POP using a H2O2-induced in vitro model. Vaginal fibroblasts were isolated from woman with POP-Q stage greater than II and asymptomatic women with normal pelvic floor support. Knockdown of ATF3 enhanced cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis. Flow cytometry and immunnofluorescence showed that ATF3 deficiency inhibited H2O2-induced ROS production and the expression of 8 OHdG and 4-HNE. Western blot and Real-time PCR analysis revealed that ATF3 deficiency attenuated ECM component degradation (increasing collagen I, collagen III and elastin) and MMPs/TIMPs imbalance (decreasing MMP2 and MMP9 and increasing TIMP2). Moreover, knockdown of ATF3 induced the activation of p38/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Further treatment with p38 inhibitor SB203580 abolished the protection of ATF3 deficiency against H2O2-induced cell damage, which was reverted by Nrf2 activator TBHQ. Thus, ATF3 likely contributes to POP progression by inducing cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and ECM degradation via regulating p38/Nrf2 pathway, which provides a potential therapeutic target for POP.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapies often modulate macrophage effector function by introducing either targeting antibodies that activate Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) or blocking antibodies that disrupt inhibitory SIRPα-CD47 engagement. However, how these competing signals are integrated is poorly understood, raising questions about how to effectively titrate immune responses. Here, we find that macrophage phagocytic decisions are regulated by the ratio of activating ligand to inhibitory ligand over a broad range of absolute molecular densities. Using both endogenous and chimeric receptors, we show that activating:inhibitory ligand ratios of at least 10:1 are required to promote phagocytosis of model antibody-opsonized CD47-inhibited targets and that lowering that ratio reduces FcγR phosphorylation because of inhibitory phosphatases recruited to CD47-bound SIRPα. We demonstrate that ratiometric signaling is critical for phagocytosis of tumor cells and can be modified by blocking SIRPα, indicating that balancing targeting and blocking antibodies may be important for controlling macrophage phagocytosis in cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
FACT (facilitate chromatin transcription) is involved in heterochromatic silencing, but its mechanisms and function remain unclear. We reveal that the Spt16 recruitment mechanism operates in two distinct ways in heterochromatin. First, Pob3 mediates Spt16 recruitment onto the heterochromatin through its Spt16 dimerization and tandem PH domains. Without Pob3, Spt16 recruitment is partially reduced, exhibiting a silencing defect and impaired H2A/H2B organization. Second, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)/Swi6 mediates Spt16 recruitment onto the heterochromatin by physical interaction of the Swi6 chromo-shadow domain (CSD) and Spt16 peptidase-like domains. Several CSD mutants are tested for Spt16 binding activity, and the charged loop connecting β1 and β2 is critical for Spt16 binding and heterochromatic silencing. Loss of these pathways causes a severe defect in H3K9 methylation and HP1/Swi6 localization in the pericentromeric region, exhibiting transcriptional silencing defects and disordered heterochromatin. Our findings suggest that FACT and HP1/Swi6 work intimately to regulate heterochromatin organization.

Abstract: Summary
In Arabidopsis mature seeds, the onset of the embryo-to-seedling transition is nonautonomously controlled, being blocked by endospermic abscisic acid (ABA) release under unfavorable conditions. Whether the mature endosperm governs additional nonautonomous developmental processes during this transition is unknown. Mature embryos have a more permeable cuticle than seedlings, consistent with their endospermic ABA uptake capability. Seedlings acquire their well-sealing cuticles adapted to aerial lifestyle during germination. Endosperm removal prevents seedling cuticle formation, and seed reconstitution by endosperm grafting onto embryos shows that the endosperm promotes seedling cuticle development. Grafting different endosperm and embryo mutant combinations, together with biochemical, microscopy, and mass spectrometry approaches, reveal that the release of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST)-sulfated CIF2 and PSY1 peptides from the endosperm promotes seedling cuticle development. Endosperm-deprived embryos produced nonviable seedlings bearing numerous developmental defects, not related to embryo malnutrition, all restored by exogenously provided endosperm. Hence, seedling establishment is nonautonomous, requiring the mature endosperm.

Cell state changes are associated with proteome remodeling to serve newly emergent cell functions. Here, we show that NGN2-driven conversion of human embryonic stem cells to induced neurons (iNeurons) is associated with increased PINK1-independent mitophagic flux that is temporally correlated with metabolic reprogramming to support oxidative phosphorylation. Global multiplex proteomics during neurogenesis revealed large-scale remodeling of functional modules linked with pluripotency, mitochondrial metabolism, and proteostasis. Differentiation-dependent mitophagic flux required BNIP3L and its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, and BNIP3L also promoted mitophagy in dopaminergic neurons. Proteomic analysis of ATG12−/− iNeurons revealed accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and mitochondria during differentiation, indicative of widespread organelle remodeling during neurogenesis. This work reveals broad organelle remodeling of membrane-bound organelles during NGN2-driven neurogenesis via autophagy, identifies BNIP3L’s central role in programmed mitophagic flux, and provides a proteomic resource for elucidating how organelle remodeling and autophagy alter the proteome during changes in cell state.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma are heterogeneous tumors composed of highly invasive and highly proliferative clones. Heterogeneity in invasiveness could emerge from discrete biophysical properties linked to specific molecular expression. We identified clones of patient-derived glioma propagating cells that were either highly proliferative or highly invasive and compared their cellular architecture, migratory, and biophysical properties. We discovered that invasiveness was linked to cellular fitness. The most invasive cells were stiffer, developed higher mechanical forces on the substrate, and moved stochastically. The mechano-chemical-induced expression of the formin FMN1 conferred invasive strength that was confirmed in patient samples. Moreover, FMN1 expression was also linked to motility in other cancer and normal cell lines, and its ectopic expression increased fitness parameters. Mechanistically, FMN1 acts from the microtubule lattice and promotes a robust mechanical cohesion, leading to highly invasive motility.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple cognitive processes are recruited to achieve adaptive behavior. However, it is poorly understood how such cognitive processes are implemented in temporal cascades of human cerebral cortical areas as processing streams to achieve behavior. In the present study, we identify cortical processing streams for response inhibition and examine relationships among the processing streams. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and time-resolved single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) reveal three distinct critical timings of transient disruption in the functionally essential cortical areas that belong to two distinct cerebrocortical networks. Furthermore, single-pulse TMS following suppression of the ventral posterior inferior frontal cortex (vpIFC) with repetitive TMS reveals information flow from the vpIFC to the presupplementary motor area (preSMA) within the same network but not to the dorsal posterior inferior frontal cortex (dpIFC) across different networks. These causal behavioral effects suggest two parallel processing streams (vpIFC-preSMA versus dpIFC-intraparietal sulcus) that act concurrently during response inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Wound healing is a coordinated process that initially relies on pro-inflammatory macrophages, followed by a pro-resolution function of these cells. Changes in cellular metabolism likely dictate these distinct activities, but the nature of these changes has been unclear. Here, we profiled early- versus late-stage skin wound macrophages in mice at both the transcriptional and functional levels. We found that glycolytic metabolism in the early phase is not sufficient to ensure productive repair. Instead, by combining conditional disruption of the electron transport chain with deletion of mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, followed by single-cell sequencing analysis, we found that a subpopulation of early-stage wound macrophages are marked by mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production and HIF1α stabilization, which ultimately drives a pro-angiogenic program essential for timely healing. In contrast, late-phase, pro-resolving wound macrophages are marked by IL-4Rα-mediated mitochondrial respiration and mitohormesis. Collectively, we identify changes in mitochondrial metabolism as a critical control mechanism for macrophage effector functions during wound healing.

Abstract: Objective
To examine the potential therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for experimental scleroderma.
Materials and methods
Fifty-four mice six-week-old (30−35 g) were studied. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) induced scleroderma was considered. Mice were divided into 3 groups: (I) Control: Six mice did not receive any treatment and were sacrificed at the end of the experiment; (II) HOCl mice (induced scleroderma as a positive control): (III) MSCs-treated HOCl mice: Thirty six HOCl-induced mice were injected with MSCs (7.5 × 105) intravenous every week for 3 weeks. Skin pieces were taken from the backs of mice and lung tissue pieces. a smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1) were analysed or fixed in 10 % formalin for skin and lung tissue histopathological analysis. Plasma nitric oxide (NO) was also assayed.
Results
There was a significant rise in the NO level and of the cutaneous and lung tissue α-SMA and TGF-β1 in untreated scleroderma-induced mice. The values significantly normalized after MSC therapy over the 7 weeks duration of the study. The altered histopathology of the skin and lung tissues in the scleroderma-induced mice showed a remarkable tendency to normalization of the skin and lung parenchyma and vasculature.
Conclusion
There was a significant rise in the level of NO and skin and lung tissue α-SMA and TGF-β1 in untreated scleroderma-induced mice and values were significantly normalized after MSC therapy over the 7 weeks duration of the study. Altered histopathology of the skin and lung appeared nearly normal after MSC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The serine synthesis pathway (SSP) involving metabolic enzymes phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), and phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) drives intracellular serine biosynthesis and is indispensable for cancer cells to grow in serine-limiting environments. However, how SSP is regulated is not well understood. Here, we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is crucial for transcriptional activation of SSP upon serine deprivation. ATF3 is rapidly induced by serine deprivation via a mechanism dependent on ATF4, which in turn binds to ATF4 and increases the stability of this master regulator of SSP. ATF3 also binds to the enhancers/promoters of PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH and recruits p300 to promote expression of these SSP genes. As a result, loss of ATF3 expression impairs serine biosynthesis and the growth of cancer cells in the serine-deprived medium or in mice fed with a serine/glycine-free diet. Interestingly, ATF3 expression positively correlates with PHGDH expression in a subset of TCGA cancer samples.

Abstract: Summary
Decreased ability to maintain tissue integrity is critically involved in aging and degenerative diseases. Fatty acid (FA) metabolism has a profound impact on animal development and tissue maintenance, but our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited. We investigated whether and how FA abundance affects muscle integrity using Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that reducing the overall FA level by blocking FA biosynthesis or inhibiting protein myristoylation leads to disorganization of sarcomere structure and adult-onset paralysis. Further analysis indicates that myristoylation of two ARF guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) critically mediates the effect of FA deficiency on sarcomere integrity through inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER unfolded protein response (UPRER), which in turn leads to reduction of the level of sarcomere component PINCH and myosin disorganization. We thus present a mechanism that links FA signal, protein myristoylation, and ER homeostasis with muscle integrity, which provides valuable insights into the regulatory role of nutrients and ER homeostasis in muscle maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Heat-shock proteins of 70 kDa (Hsp70s) are vital for all life and are notably important in protein folding. Hsp70s use ATP binding and hydrolysis at a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) to control the binding and release of client polypeptides at a substrate-binding domain (SBD); however, the mechanistic basis for this allostery has been elusive. Here, we first characterize biochemical properties of selected domain-interface mutants in bacterial Hsp70 DnaK. We then develop a theoretical model for allosteric equilibria among Hsp70 conformational states to explain the observations: a restraining state, Hsp70R-ATP, restricts ATP hydrolysis and binds peptides poorly, whereas a stimulating state, Hsp70S-ATP, hydrolyzes ATP rapidly and has high intrinsic substrate affinity but rapid binding kinetics. We support this model for allosteric regulation with DnaK structures obtained in the postulated stimulating state S with biochemical tests of the S-state interface and with improved peptide-binding-site definition in an R-state structure.

Abstract: Summary
How autophagy initiation is regulated and what the functional significance of this regulation is are unknown. Here, we characterized the role of yeast Vac8 in autophagy initiation through recruitment of PIK3C3-C1 to the phagophore assembly site (PAS). This recruitment is dependent on the palmitoylation of Vac8 and on its middle ARM domains for binding PIK3C3-C1. Vac8-mediated anchoring of PIK3C3-C1 promotes PtdIns3P generation at the PAS and recruitment of the PtdIns3P binding protein Atg18-Atg2. The mouse homolog of Vac8, ARMC3, is conserved and functions in autophagy in mouse testes. Mice lacking ARMC3 have normal viability but show complete male infertility. Proteomic analysis indicated that the autophagic degradation of cytosolic ribosomes was blocked in ARMC3-deficient spermatids, which caused low energy levels of mitochondria and motionless flagella. These studies uncovered a function of Vac8/ARMC3 in PtdIns3-kinase anchoring at the PAS and its physical significance in mammalian spermatogenesis with a germ tissue-specific autophagic function.

Abstract: Summary
Of the eight distinct polyubiquitin (polyUb) linkages that can be assembled, the roles of K48-linked polyUb (K48-polyUb) are the most established, with K48-polyUb modified proteins being targeted for degradation. MINDY1 and MINDY2 are members of the MINDY family of deubiquitinases (DUBs) that have exquisite specificity for cleaving K48-polyUb, yet we have a poor understanding of their catalytic mechanism. Here, we analyze the crystal structures of MINDY1 and MINDY2 alone and in complex with monoUb, di-, and penta-K48-polyUb, identifying 5 distinct Ub binding sites in the catalytic domain that explain how these DUBs sense both Ub chain length and linkage type to cleave K48-polyUb chains. The activity of MINDY1/2 is inhibited by the Cys-loop, and we find that substrate interaction relieves autoinhibition to activate these DUBs. We also find that MINDY1/2 use a non-canonical catalytic triad composed of Cys-His-Thr. Our findings highlight multiple layers of regulation modulating DUB activity in MINDY1 and MINDY2.

Abstract: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has become a global health concern. Various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed and are being used for vaccination worldwide. However, no therapeutic agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been developed so far; therefore, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. In the present study, we evaluated several hepatitis C virus direct-acting antivirals as potential candidates for drug repurposing against COVID-19. Theses include asunaprevir (a protease inhibitor), daclatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), and sofosbuvir (an RNA polymerase inhibitor). We found that asunaprevir, but not sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects in Vero E6 cells. Both RNA and protein levels of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly decreased by treatment with asunaprevir. Moreover, asunaprevir profoundly decreased virion release from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. A pseudoparticle entry assay revealed that asunaprevir blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection at the binding step of the viral life cycle. Furthermore, asunaprevir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in human lung Calu-3 cells. Collectively, we found that asunaprevir displays broad-spectrum antiviral activity and therefore might be worth developing as a new drug repurposing candidate for COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin fibers must fold or coil in the process of chromosome condensation. Patterns of coiling have been demonstrated for reconstituted chromatin, but the actual trajectories of fibers in condensed states of chromosomes could not be visualized because of the high density of the material. We have exploited partial decondensation of mitotic chromosomes to reveal their internal structure at sub-nucleosomal resolution by cryo-electron tomography, without the use of stains, fixatives, milling, or sectioning. DNA gyres around nucleosomes were visible, allowing the nucleosomes to be identified and their orientations to be determined. Linker DNA regions were traced, revealing the trajectories of the chromatin fibers. The trajectories were irregular, with almost no evidence of coiling and no short- or long-range order of the chromosomal material. The 146-bp core particle, long known as a product of nuclease digestion, is identified as the native state of the nucleosome, with no regular spacing along the chromatin fibers.

Abstract: Ca2+ and pH homeostasis are closely intertwined and this interrelationship is crucial in the cells' ability to adapt to varying environmental conditions. To further understand this Ca2+-pH link, cytosolic Ca2+ was monitored using the aequorin-based bioluminescent assay in parallel with fluorescence reporter-based assays to monitor plasma membrane potentials and intracellular (cytosolic and vacuolar) pH in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At external pH 5, starved yeast cells displayed depolarized membrane potentials and responded to glucose re-addition with small Ca2+ transients accompanied by cytosolic alkalinization and profound vacuolar acidification. In contrast, starved cells at external pH 7 were hyperpolarized and glucose re-addition induced large Ca2+ transients and vacuolar alkalinization. In external Ca2+-free medium, glucose-induced pH responses were not affected but Ca2+ transients were abolished, indicating that the intracellular [Ca2+] increase was not prerequisite for activation of the two primary proton pumps, being Pma1 at the plasma membrane and the vacuolar and Golgi localized V-ATPases. A reduction in Pma1 expression resulted in membrane depolarization and reduced Ca2+ transients, indicating that the membrane hyperpolarization generated by Pma1 activation governed the Ca2+ influx that is associated with glucose-induced Ca2+ transients. Loss of V-ATPase activity through concanamycin A inhibition did not alter glucose-induced cytosolic pH responses but affected vacuolar pH changes and Ca2+ transients, indicating that the V-ATPase established vacuolar proton gradient is substantial for organelle H+/Ca2+ exchange. Finally, a systematic analysis of yeast deletion strains allowed us to reveal an essential role for both the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ exchanger Vcx1 and the Golgi exchanger Gdt1 in the dissipation of intracellular Ca2+.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal aging is characterized by low bone turnover and marrow fat accumulation. However, the underlying mechanism for this imbalance is unclear. Here, we show that during aging in rats and mice proinflammatory and senescent subtypes of immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, accumulate in the bone marrow and secrete abundant grancalcin. The injection of recombinant grancalcin into young mice was sufficient to induce premature skeletal aging. In contrast, genetic deletion of Gca in neutrophils and macrophages delayed skeletal aging. Mechanistically, we found that grancalcin binds to the plexin-b2 receptor and partially inactivates its downstream signaling pathways, thus repressing osteogenesis and promoting adipogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells. Heterozygous genetic deletion of Plexnb2 in skeletal stem cells abrogated the improved bone phenotype of Gca-knockout mice. Finally, we developed a grancalcin-neutralizing antibody and showed that its treatment of older mice improved bone health. Together, our data suggest that grancalcin could be a potential target for the treatment of age-related osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
In animals, Argonaute small-RNA pathways scan germline transcripts to silence self-replicating genetic elements. However, little is known about how endogenous gene expression is recognized and licensed. Here, we show that the presence of introns and, by inference, the process of mRNA splicing prevents default Argonaute-mediated silencing in the C. elegans germline. The silencing of intronless genes is initiated independently of the piRNA pathway but nevertheless engages multiple components of the downstream amplification and maintenance mechanisms that mediate transgenerational silencing, including both nuclear and cytoplasmic members of the worm-specific Argonaute gene family (WAGOs). Small RNAs amplified from intronless mRNAs can trans-silence cognate intron-containing genes. Interestingly, a second, small RNA-independent cis-acting mode of silencing also acts on intronless mRNAs. Our findings suggest that cues put in place during mRNA splicing license germline gene expression and provide evidence for a splicing-dependent and dsRNA- and piRNA-independent mechanism that can program Argonaute silencing.
