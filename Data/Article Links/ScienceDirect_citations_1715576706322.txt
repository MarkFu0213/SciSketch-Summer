Abstract: Neuromuscular junctions transmit signals from the nervous system to skeletal muscles, triggering their contraction, and their proper organization is essential for breathing and voluntary movements. αDystrobrevin-1 is a cytoplasmic component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and has pivotal functions in regulating the integrity of muscle fibers and neuromuscular junctions. Previous studies identified that αDystrobrevin-1 functions in the organization of the neuromuscular junction and that its phosphorylation in the C-terminus is required in this process. Our proteomic screen identified several putative αDystrobrevin-1 interactors recruited to the Y730 site in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states. Amongst various actin-modulating proteins, we identified the Arp2/3 complex regulator cortactin. We showed that similarly to αDystrobrevin-1, cortactin is strongly enriched at the neuromuscular postsynaptic machinery and obtained results suggesting that these two proteins interact in cell homogenates and at the neuromuscular junctions. Analysis of synaptic morphology in cortactin knockout mice showed abnormalities in the slow-twitching soleus muscle and not in the fast-twitching tibialis anterior. However, muscle strength examination did not reveal apparent deficits in knockout animals.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid advancements in wearable technology demand innovative materials that are flexible, lightweight, and environmentally sustainable. Here, we report the formulation, characterization, and application of screen-printed piezoelectric inks consisting of barium titanate (BT), barium calcium zirconate titanate (BCZT), and potassium sodium niobate (KNN) for flexible piezoelectric sensors. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy reveal high crystallinity and distinct morphologies. Rheological experiments show excellent printability; however, the BCZT-based ink reveals shear thickening behavior and a lower recovery rate of 63.5% during printing. Thermal gravimetric and Fourier transform infrared spectral analyses provide insights into the inks’ thermal and chemical stability. The screen-printed composites exhibit excellent adhesion to the substrates and consistent dielectric properties across a wide frequency range. A detailed investigation of the piezoelectric charge coefficient d33 under varying poling conditions is carried out using corona discharge poling. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of ceramic fillers in influencing the rheological, thermal, and piezoelectric properties of screen-printed piezoelectric inks, guiding the development of customizable flexible sensors.

Abstract: Summary
De-risking energy storage investments necessary to meet CO2 reduction targets requires a deep understanding of the connections between battery health, design, and use. The historical definition of the battery state of health (SOH) as the percentage of current versus initial capacity is inadequate for this purpose, motivating an expanded SOH consisting of an interrelated set of descriptors including capacity, energy, ionic and electronic impedances, open-circuit voltages, and microstructure metrics. In this work, we introduce deep transformer networks for the simultaneous prognosis of 28 battery SOH descriptors using two cycling datasets representing six lithium-ion cathode chemistries, multiple electrolyte/anode compositions, and different charge-discharge scenarios. The accuracy of these predictions for battery life (with an unprecedented mean absolute error of 19 cycles in predicting end of life for a lithium-iron-phosphate fast-charging dataset) illustrates the promise of deep learning toward providing enhanced understanding and control of battery health.

Abstract: Summary
Materials with tunable properties are crucial for mitigating CO2 emissions. Here, uniform and well-structured porous Rubik’s cube-shaped Linde type A (LTA) zeolites are synthesized for CO2 capture, representing advancement in eco-friendly and cost-effective materials. The synthesis procedure extracts melting silicon from silicon-rich biomass ashes, followed by template-free hydrothermal synthesis. The melting approach is proposed to collect silicon for high hydroxide anion concentration and outstanding flowability, accelerating reaction kinetics and yielding alkaline silicon-containing solutions to promote crystallization of zeolites. These zeolites possess CO2 sorption capacity (2.97 mmol/g at 1 bar and 298 K) and selectivity for CO2/N2 (around 255.1), influenced by ultramicropores with heterogeneous surfaces containing metal ions. Cyclic robustness during vacuum temperature swing cycles displays a low attenuation rate (approximately 7.7% over 20 cycles). Thus, Rubik’s cube-shaped LTA zeolites are a promising and cost-effective approach to addressing CO2 capture challenges by leveraging readily available biomass materials.

Abstract: Summary
Investigating exciton dynamics and device physics in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (Ph-OLEDs) is important for developing highly efficient devices with optimal color purity. Herein, we conduct an in-depth exploration of the recombination zone and various radiative transitions within blue Ph-OLEDs using operando electrically pumped spectroscopy. It serves as a versatile tool enabling the simultaneous analysis of time-resolved electroluminescence and photoluminescence. Our findings reveal that Ph-OLEDs with thin emission layers (3–5 nm) predominantly exhibit electromer emissions with minor interface exciplex formation, causing a reduction in efficiency. Conversely, thicker emission layers (30–40 nm) promote exciplex formation at the hole transport layer/emission layer interface, manipulating device color purity due to charge balance and recombination zone issues. Hence, electrically pumped spectroscopy is beneficial in deciphering parasitic excitons and their role in the efficiency/color purity of Ph-OLEDs. This operando investigation lays a foundation for understanding exciton dynamics and developing highly efficient device architectures.

Abstract: Summary
The success of lithium-ion batteries has relied on the application of ethylene carbonate-based electrolytes, but their high freezing point and strong solvating power frustrate operation under low-temperature and fast-charging conditions. Here, we report that a class of acetal electrolytes can support reversible lithium-ion intercalation into graphite without solvent co-intercalation at conventional concentrations, which comes from the unique four-membered-ring coordination structure of lithium and anion-rich inner solvation shells resulting in the weaker solvation energy of acetal electrolytes. Furthermore, the anion-rich solvation structures also contribute to the formation of a stable inorganic-compound-dominated solid electrolyte interphase. The graphite anode retains 80% of its capacity for more than 200 cycles with single-solvent/single-salt electrolytes. The co-intercalation-free nature and wide liquid region of acetal molecules show promise for broadening the environmental suitability of batteries.

Abstract: The use of strategies to reduce blood loss and transfusions is essential in the treatment of surgical patients, including in complex cardiac surgeries and those that use cardiopulmonary bypass. Antifibrinolytics, such as epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (TXA), are widely used in these procedures, as well as in other types of surgeries. These medicines are included in the World Health Organization (WHO) list of ‘essential medicines’. Scientific evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of EACA in reducing bleeding and the need for transfusions in heart surgery. EACA is highly recommended for use in heart surgery by the American Society of Anesthesiology Task Force on Perioperative Blood Management. Regarding the safety of EACA, there is no robust evidence of any significant thrombotic potential. TXA has also been shown to be effective in reducing the use of blood transfusions in cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries and is considered safer than other antifibrinolytic agents. There is no evidence of any increased risk of thromboembolic events with TXA, but doses greater than 2 g per day have been associated with an increased risk of seizures. It is also important to adjust the dose in patients with renal impairment. In conclusion, antifibrinolytics, such as EACA and TXA, are effective in reducing blood loss and transfusion use in cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries, without causing serious adverse effects.

Abstract: Summary
The straightforward preparation of amino-modified cellulose-based triboelectric materials with strong electron-donating ability, high contact electrification activity, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness has attracted widespread attention from researchers. Here, three facile and rapid methods have been reported for the multistage synthesis of amino-modified TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibril (TOCN); that is, using small molecules, dendritic, and crosslinked amines to directly modify the carboxylic acid groups unique to TOCN. These modified TOCNs are prepared into dense films and aerogel films for positive triboelectric materials. Comprehensive effects of the amount of amine grafting and specific surface area on triboelectric properties are investigated. The final prepared triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) device outputs a maximum open-circuit voltage of 217 V, a closed-circuit current of 19.2 μA, and a power density of 1.6 W/m2. This TENG device can be used effectively for human limb sensing and micromechanical energy harvesting.

Abstract: Patient Blood Management (PBM) is a holistic approach to managing blood as a resource of each patient; it is a multimodal strategy that is implemented using a set of techniques that can be applied in individual cases. In fact, the overall result of the implementation of PBM cannot be fully appreciated or explained by simply summing up the effects of the individual strategies and techniques used, since they can only produce the expected ideal result if combined. Implementing a PBM program in healthcare offers several benefits including improved patient safety, better outcomes, cost savings, conservation of resources, evidence-based practice, transfusion alternatives, improved quality of care, compliance with accreditation standards, patient-centered care, and professional education and training.

Abstract: Summary
Manufacturing fine three-dimensional (3D) structures from mesoscale down to nanoscale is of considerable importance in multiple application backgrounds. Here, we investigate the freezing of a nanofluid drop whose contact line is pinned by a 2D wettability base pattern. A surprisingly rich variety of shape choices for the top plateau can be obtained for basic polygonal patterns, allowing us to control the out-of-plane shape of the frozen drop. To understand the morphology of such an edge-confined drop and its shape change during solidification, we assume that the drop is an assembly of multiple slices with varying contact radii and a shared axial. Each contact radius yields a corresponding top plateau size at a certain drop height, engendering a specific plateau shape. The ability to control the plateau of a frozen drop and the fundamental understanding of its formation shed light on an alternative 3D fabrication method.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian skin is a densely innervated soft tissue where neural mechanoreceptors embedded in the skin report to the brain the mechanical events arising at its surface. Up to now, models of the transformations of these events into neural signals relied on quasi-static or viscoelastic mechanical models of the skin tissue. Here we developed a model, which, in addition to elasticity and viscosity, accounted for mass to accurately reproduce the propagation of mechanical waves observed in vivo. Skin dynamics converted sensory inputs into rapidly evolving spatiotemporal patterns that magnified the information made available to a population of mechanoreceptors. Accounting for dynamics in the skin tissue thus greatly enhanced the separability of tactile inputs and was efficient for a large range of mechanical parameter values. This advantage vanished when these parameters were set to approximate the quasi-static or viscoelastic cases.

Abstract: Summary
Underwater robots desire versatile, water-adaptive, untethered, and rapidly actuating soft artificial muscles. Existing artificial muscles compromise between high water compatibility and untethered rapid actuation. Taking inspiration from the watery and fast contraction characteristics of jellyfish, we present a jelly-like muscle design that features an extremely soft (elastic modulus, 66.9 kPa) and watery (water content, 83.3%) structure. The jelly-like muscle can instantly respond to electrical stimuli and provide underwater propulsion. The muscle can shift propulsion direction by simply tuning the voltage signal and quickly recover from electromechanical failures through repair. An untethered robot can be assembled by stimulating the muscle with an onboard power system. The robot reaches a maximum speed of 0.91 cm/s (0.3 body length per second) and has an endurance of 15.7 min with a 500-mAh lithium-ion battery. Robots can be constructed in different forms by tailoring the jelly-like muscle, which is promising for various applications.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanism of non-uniform deposition of lithium and dendrite growth is necessary for battery degradation and safety performance improvement. Here, we design a symmetric cell sealed in a glass capillary to observe in situ the morphological changes during the lithium deposition process. Based on the in situ observation results and ex situ battery postmortem scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results, it is found that uneven lithium deposition inevitably occurs under long-term electrodeposition. In addition, lithium deposition under high current density is loose and porous, which is accompanied by the growth of needle-like lithium dendrites. This study reveals that the surface morphology of the anode and the electric field form a feedback mechanism: uneven morphology forms an uneven electric field, leading to a “tip effect” on the electrode surface, causing further uneven lithium deposition and lithium dendrite growth.

Abstract: Understanding the physiological concepts of oxygen delivery is essential to discern the mechanisms that influence its increase, reduction or maintenance in the body. This text explores the different mechanisms that help maintain oxygen delivery even in the face of reduced hemoglobin levels. Adequate oxygen delivery ensures tissue and metabolic balance, which is crucial to avoid harmful consequences such as metabolic acidosis and cellular dysoxia. The complex interaction between variables such as cardiac output, hemoglobin and heart rate (HR) plays a fundamental role in maintaining oxygen delivery, allowing the body to temporarily adjust to situations of anemia or high metabolic demand. It is important to emphasize that blood transfusions should not be based on fixed values, but rather on individual metabolic needs. Strategies to reduce myocardial consumption and monitor macro and micro hemodynamics help in making rational decisions. Individualizing treatment and considering factors such as blood viscosity in relation to the benefits of transfusion are increasingly relevant to optimize therapy and minimize risks, especially in complex clinical scenarios, such as neurocritical patients and trauma victims.

4H-4-Hydroxybenzo[e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine-1,1-dioxides are based on a widely found structural motif for pharmaceutical applications, having an additional unique exocyclic N–O bond that is not accessible by conventional synthetic routes. Electrochemistry offers a sustainable tool for the direct synthesis of these heterocyclic structures containing this N-hydroxy modification. Here, we report a highly selective synthesis of 4H-4-hydroxybenzo[e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine-1,1-dioxides by direct reduction of widely available nitro arenes in almost quantitative yields. The electro-synthetic protocol is applied to more than 40 diverse examples, highlighting the versatility of this method. Furthermore, the technical relevance is demonstrated by two multi-gram-scale syntheses.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an hemoglobinopathy resulting in the production of an abnormal Hb (HbS) which can polymerize in deoxygenated conditions, leading to the sickling of red blood cells (RBC). These alterations can decrease the oxygen-carrying capacity leading to impaired function and energetics of skeletal muscle. Any strategy which could reverse the corresponding defects could be of interest. In SCD, endurance training is known to improve multiples muscle properties which restores patient's exercise capacity but present reduced effects in anemic patients. Hydroxyurea (HU) can increase fetal hemoglobin production which can reduce anemia in patients. The present study was conducted to determine whether HU can improve the effects of endurance training to improve muscle function and energetics. Twenty SCD Townes mice have been trained for 8 weeks with (n = 11) or without (n = 9) HU. SCD mice muscle function and energetics were analyzed during a standardized rest-exercise-recovery protocol, using Phosphorus-31 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) and transcutaneous stimulation. The combination of training and HU specifically decreased fatigue index and PCr consumption while muscle oxidative capacity was improved. These results illustrate the potential synergistic effects of endurance training and HU on muscle function and energetics in sickle cell disease.

Abstract: Summary
Solar panels (modules) based on metal halide perovskites are following a fast track to commercialization. Unlike more established solar cell materials, there are not yet decades-long field observations to increase consumer confidence. The “physics and chemistry of failure” approach is used in other industries and estimates product degradation based on laboratory accelerated tests integrated with an understanding of degradation mechanisms. This work uses that approach to quantify the relationship between accelerated tests and projected product behavior for metal halide perovskite modules. Degradation involving photooxidation of methylammonium lead iodide is used to illustrate the method. Acceleration factors in common accelerated tests are found to be low. Conclusions emphasize that the accelerated tests on photovoltaics should not be interpreted as equivalent across module types or as a green light for commercialization unless supported by the appropriate field data or physics and chemistry of failure analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Scaling organic solar cells (OSCs) for commercial use is challenging. High-quality and precise scribing is needed to bridge lab-scale cells and large-area OSC modules, but the research lags significantly. Here, we demonstrate a cost-effective patterning approach using a 355-nm ultraviolet nanosecond pulsed laser for performing all scribing processes, including P1, P2, and P3, in the fabrication of OSC modules. Optimized laser processing enables an 80-μm interconnection width, comparable with femtosecond laser methods, and broadens the process window of P2 layer patterning, making OSC module performance less impacted by indium tin oxide damage. With ultraviolet nanosecond laser scribing, the OSC module yields an impressive geometric fill factor of 98% and a certified power conversion efficiency of 15.43% with an aperture area of 11.30 cm2, making it one of the top-performing OSC modules reported. This study delivers an efficient, repeatable laser patterning method for high-quality OSC modules.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and gating access to genes. Even when the binding of TFs and their cofactors to DNA is reversible, indicating a reversible control of gene expression, there is little knowledge about the molecular effect DNA has on TFs. Using single-molecule multiparameter fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical assays, we find that the monomeric form of the forkhead (FKH) domain of the human FoxP1 behaves as a disordered protein and increases its folded population when it dimerizes. Notably, DNA binding promotes a disordered FKH dimer bound to DNA, negatively controlling the stability of the dimeric FoxP1:DNA complex. The DNA-mediated reversible regulation on FKH dimers suggests that FoxP1-dependent gene suppression is unstable, and it must require the presence of other dimerization domains or cofactors to revert the negative impact exerted by the DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Morphological development into evolutionary patterns under structural instability is ubiquitous in living systems and often of vital importance for engineering structures. Here, we propose a general data-driven approach to understand and predict their spatiotemporal complexities. A machine-learning framework is proposed based on the physical modeling of morphogenesis triggered by internal or external forcing. Digital libraries of structural patterns are constructed from the simulation data that are then used to recognize the abnormalities, predict their development, and assist in risk assessment and prognosis. The capabilities of identifying the key bifurcation characteristics and predicting the history-dependent development from the global and local features are demonstrated by examples of brain growth and aerospace structural design that share similar spatiotemporal features. The results of prediction and related discussion offer guidelines for disease diagnosis/prognosis and instability-tolerant design.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon dioxide is an abundant carbon resource for chemical and fuel synthesis. Formic acid, vital for hydrogen storage, has numerous applications. Covalent organic frameworks are a unique class of materials composed of interconnected organic building blocks through covalent bonds. They possess porosity and functional groups, making them suitable for creating supported metallic catalysts. In this study, we present a strategy that utilizes covalent organic frameworks with diverse structures and chemical compositions to enhance carbon dioxide hydrogenation to formic acid at low temperatures. This enhancement arises from both high density of single-atom ruthenium sites and their intrinsic activity. Operando X-ray absorption and catalytic tests demonstrate that the concentration of nitrogen functional groups affects the intrinsic single-site ruthenium activity, whereas the impact of oxygen-containing groups is minor. Catalyst stability is attributed to the ability of single atoms to resist reduction to metallic state. This strategy has broad applicability for various covalent organic framework-supported single-atom catalysts.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing the electrode thickness, thereby reducing the proportion of inactive cell components, is one way to achieve higher-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. This, however, results in higher electronic and ionic overpotentials and/or mechanical failure induced by binder migration. Here, we report ethanol-induced phase inversion as an effective method for making high-mass-loading nickel-rich, layered oxide (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 [NMC811]) electrodes. The ethanol-induced phase inversion electrodes significantly outperform their conventionally processed counterparts with similar loading (35 mg/cm2) and porosity (30%) in Li/NMC half-cells (131.7 mAh/g vs. 56.7 mAh/g) at 1C (7 mA/cm2) discharge. The binder structure induced by the nonsolvent improves the pore connectivity and results in lower tortuosity factors. The rapid solvent removal reduces the binder migration during drying, enabling ultrahigh active mass loadings up to 60 mg/cm2 (12 mAh/cm2). Further, the compatibility of the phase inversion process with current roll-to-roll coating setups makes this a processing technique with high industrial feasibility.

Abstract: Introduction
Early Death (ED) remains challenging in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), especially in developing countries. The clinical and laboratory profile at diagnosis were evaluated and causes and risk factors were investigated in adult APL patients.
Method
A retrospective real-life analysis of 141 medical records was performed of patients diagnosed with APL between 2007 and 2018, whether they were treated with the IC-APL 2006 protocol or not. Risk factors were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.
Main results
Overall, 112 patients were included in the study. ED occurred in 22.3% of cases, surpassing clinical trial reports, with non-protocol-eligible patients presenting notably higher rates (60%), potentially due to their clinical status. Hemorrhage (60%) and infection (33.3%) were the leading causes of ED. Univariate analysis associated ED to the ECOG score; white blood cell (WBC) count; body mass index; levels of hemoglobin, albumin, uric acid, and creatinine, aPTT and INR and FLT3 mutations. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG score ≥2 and elevated WBC count as independent risk factors.
Conclusion
ED remains a substantial challenge in APL, especially in real-world settings with hemorrhage and infection being the leading causes. ECOG status and WBC count emerged as independent risk factors, while age and platelet count lacked a 30-day prognostic correlation. Evaluating prognostic enhancement tools in controlled trials and real-life settings is pivotal to improving APL outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
The intermolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation represents a straightforward approach to synthesizing C(sp2)–C(sp3) bonds. When readily accessible alcohols are utilized directly as the alkylating agents, the sole byproduct generated is water. Traditional Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions are typically limited to alkyl (pseudo)halides and activated alcohols that form stabilized carbocations. However, by using inexpensive and abundant ZnCl2 and camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) as catalysts, we present a site-selective Friedel-Crafts alkylation of phenolic derivatives with unactivated secondary alcohols. This catalytic process favors ortho-selectivity, even in the absence of steric influence. Mechanistic studies elucidate the origin of site selectivity, favoring an SN1 pathway in which zinc and CSA function to scaffold both the phenolic and alcohol reactants for ortho-functionalization. This work highlights the efficacy of simple catalysts for achieving C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond synthesis, departing from conventional transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling methods.

Abstract: Summary
There is a drive to use bio-based feedstocks in polymers and engineer new materials for circularity. Here, we aimed to study bio-based, lower-ceiling-temperature alternatives to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to achieve enhanced recycling and performance. We show that poly(α-methylene-δ-valerolactone) (PMVL) and poly(α-methylene-δ-decalactone) (PMDL), derived from the corresponding bio-based monomers MVL and MDL, exhibit five advantages compared to PMMA: exceptionally high polymerization rates under green conditions, near-quantitative bulk depolymerization to recover the monomer under mild conditions, enhanced solvent resistance and glass transition temperatures, atom-efficient reversible upcycling to advanced materials, and reduction of the temperature needed for recycling high-ceiling-temperature polyacrylates by forming copolymers doped with MDL. All advantaged properties can be accredited to the pendent lactone attached to the all-carbon backbone. Lastly, techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment for producing PMVL from bio-based sources show that the production could be economically and environmentally competitive with PMMA under ambitious recycling scenarios that leverage the inherent recyclability of PMVL.

Abstract: Summary
Radiative cooling is a passive cooling process to reduce temperature by emitting infrared radiation in the atmospheric window range of 8–13 μm. In this work, droplets and wrinkles, which can induce Mie scattering and therefore increase emissivity, are generated via low-cost and scalable spray coating to enable economical radiative cooling production (∼$0.05/m2). Tested during the daytime with ∼920 W m−2 and ∼58% relative humidity in Thailand, the double layer consisting of droplets on top of a polydimethylsiloxane flat film can lead to a temperature reduction of 1.22°C and 3.61°C below the baseline temperature (without the coating) under an airflow test box and a closed test box, respectively. Furthermore, cooling stability and applicability on functional substrates such as glass, wood, and roof tiles are investigated. To demonstrate scalability, a commercial spray gun is used as an all-in-one technique for fabrication, achieving a similar temperature reduction and opening doors for commercialization.

Abstract: Objective
To clinically and laboratory characterize patients with a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) treated at the Hospital das Clínicas of the Federal University of Goiás (HC-UFG)
Methods
A retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out collecting data from medical records of patients with a positive DAT who were treated at HC-UFG between August 2021 and August 2022
Results
Eighty-four patients with positive polyspecific DAT results were screened in the clinical laboratory. Fifty-four patients had a laboratory profile compatible with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), however, among these, 16 patients already had a diagnosis of AIHA in their medical records. The most common symptoms present among AIHA patients were pallor, asthenia, fatigue and dyspnea. For the remaining patients, the most common symptoms were severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal dysfunction, fever, myalgia, headache, thrombosis, asthenia, hematuria and joint pain. Only one patient had primary AIHA, that is, he had no evident underlying disease. The majority of AIHA patients (75 %) underwent corticosteroid therapy with 60 % having a positive response. For patients without AIHA, prednisone was the most frequently prescribed medication in 17 (25 %) patients, followed by hydroxychloroquine (14 patients - 20.1 %)
Conclusion
It is essential to evaluate patients with positive DAT in detail in order to understand the real clinical case. The DAT serological result alone does not arrive at a conclusive diagnosis of AIHA, and so it must be evaluated in conjunction with both clinical data and other laboratory tests, such as hemoglobin concentration and hemolysis tests (reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase and/or haptoglobin).

Abstract: Summary
The structural tunability and compositional diversity of multicomponent perovskite oxides have enabled their various applications. The cation ordering in these oxides, ranging from disordered to ordered, profoundly controls their properties but concurrently complicates the design and discovery of these materials. While first-principles simulations and machine learning can typically predict properties associated with a particular ordering, inferring which ordering—if any—will dominate experimentally remains challenging. In this work, we establish data-driven, physics-informed descriptors of experimental ordering in multicomponent perovskite oxides to offer systematic benchmarks between machine learning, theory, and experiments. While state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potentials only partially capture experimental ordering, descriptors obtained from first-principles simulations correctly rank up to 93% of compositions in an experimental dataset of 190 perovskite oxides between cation ordered and disordered. These descriptors can accelerate the high-throughput virtual screening of multicomponent oxides by predicting dominant ordering before experiments to avoid costly, exhaustive simulations of cation arrangements.

Abstract: Background
Therapeutic options for steroid-resistant non-type 2 inflammation in obstructive lung diseases are limited. Bronchial epithelial cells are key in the pathogenesis by releasing the central proinflammatory cytokine interleukine-8 (IL-8). Olfactory receptors (ORs) are expressed in various cell types. This study examined the drug target potential of ORs by investigating their impact on associated pathophysiological processes in lung epithelial cells.
Methods
Experiments were performed in the A549 cell line and in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. OR expression was investigated using RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemical staining. OR-mediated effects were analyzed by measuring 1) intracellular calcium concentration via calcium imaging, 2) cAMP concentration by luminescence-based assays, 3) wound healing by scratch assays, 4) proliferation by MTS-based assays, 5) cellular vitality by Annexin V/PI-based FACS staining, and 6) the secretion of IL-8 in culture supernatants by ELISA.
Results
By screening 100 potential OR agonists, we identified two, Brahmanol and Cinnamaldehyde, that increased intracellular calcium concentrations. The mRNA and proteins of the corresponding receptors OR2AT4 and OR2J3 were detected. Stimulation of OR2J3 with Cinnamaldehyde reduced 1) IL-8 in the absence and presence of bacterial and viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), 2) proliferation, and 3) wound healing but increased cAMP. In contrast, stimulation of OR2AT4 by Brahmanol increased wound healing but did not affect cAMP and proliferation. Both ORs did not influence cell vitality.
Conclusion
ORs might be promising drug target candidates for lung diseases with non-type 2 inflammation. Their stimulation might reduce inflammation or prevent tissue remodeling by promoting wound healing.

Abstract: Many countries have modified their policies on banning or deferring blood donation by men who have sex with men (MSM) in light of ethical concerns and new evidence about transfusion risks. In Brazil, MSM were not eligible to donate blood unless they had been celibate for the previous 12 months. However, in May 2020, the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court overturned this restriction. Many authors have attempted to stress possible risks of transfusion-transmitted infection under various scenarios of changes in bans or restrictions on donations by MSM using mathematical models, but we consider that it is a difficult task due to the wide variety of sexual behaviors, attitudes, and practices. Among these factors, we highlight sex under the influence of illicit drugs, and the fact that people with an undetectable human immunodeficiency virus viral load have the potential to transmit should their blood be transfused. Despite these possible risks, we believe that some MSM can donate blood regardless of the time elapsed since their last sexual contact, especially because blood donations by MSM were occurring even when there were time-based deferral rules. Blood banks should always seek to use screening algorithms to identify high-risk sexual behaviors using gender-neutral criteria, and education about transfusion risks should be offered to healthcare workers and MSM.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving high sensitivity of pressure-responsive devices across a wide detection range using a single device remains a challenge. Here, we present a straightforward fabrication of a robust, tunable, economical, and highly sensitive pressure-responding unit. It is built on a switchable noncontinuous circuit design, where conductive routes are pre-disconnected through 3D distribution control of conducting material inside an elastic porous skeleton. The concept is realized by rotationally vortexing colloidal suspended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the elastic melamine sponge, producing an internal CNT distribution gradient architecture. External pressure stimuli initiate reconnection of conductive pathways by structure deformation and reduce overall resistance based on gradual circuit rebuilding. Parallel assembly of multiple units into one device to respond to a wide pressure range makes this design suitable for human motion detection as well as detecting random animals’ free passage. This design should further progress the current pressure-responsive devices and facilitate its practical applications.

Abstract: The preoperative clinical and laboratory evaluations of the patient is an essential step to ensure the safety and success of any surgical procedure. This assessment aims to identify any underlying medical conditions and risk factors and determine suitability for surgery. With this step, the medical team can adapt the care plan to meet each patient's specific needs, increasing the chances of a successful procedure. Good clinical assessment and comprehensive laboratory testing, when integrated into a Patient Blood Management approach, are invaluable in promoting safety of care, reducing transfusion risks, improving surgical outcomes, and optimizing resource utilization. This approach not only elevates the quality of care, but is also aligned with evidence-based practice and patient-centered principles, making it an essential component of the perioperative process.

Abstract: Summary
Single-molecule experiments have demonstrated the stochastic nature of protein dynamics, spanning a broad range of space and time. However, faster conformational transitions relative to measuring rates are recorded as unresolved flicker signals, and conventional time-domain methods are intractable for analysis. Here, we establish an analytical method for extracting rate constants of proteins’ conformational changes from flicker data. An amplitude histogram compiled from flicker data retains kinetic information in its histogram shape, which is fitted with a beta distribution for deducing rate constants. Simulation studies reveal a robust capability of the method for estimating fast flicker rates overwhelming the recording frequency. We examine the single-channel current of the KcsA potassium channel undergoing flicker blocking by a quaternary ammonium and obtain the blocking rate constants. The results indicate that our analytical method is generally useful for single-molecule data and substantially extends the temporal resolution of single-molecule analyses.

Abstract: Managing coagulation disorders and potential bleeding risks, especially in the context of anticoagulant medications, is of immense value both clinically and prior to surgery. Coagulation disorders can lead to bleeding complications, affecting patient safety and surgical outcomes. The use of Patient Blood Management protocols offers a comprehensive, evidence-based approach that effectively addresses these challenges. The problem is to find a delicate balance between preventing thromboembolic events (blood clots) and reducing the risk of bleeding. Anticoagulant medications, although crucial to preventing clot formation, can increase the potential for bleeding during surgical procedures. Patient blood management protocols aim to optimize patient outcomes by minimizing blood loss and unnecessary transfusions.

Abstract: Summary
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) involve atomically dispersed metal atoms on solid supports. SACs combine the fast reaction kinetics of homogeneous catalysts with the recyclability of heterogeneous catalysts, providing great technological opportunities. To date, SAC research has focused primarily on the development of synthetic methods and fuel production. Here, we report a combination of SAC and nanomotor design to fabricate motile systems, referred to here as SAC-nanomotors. This concept is demonstrated by an Fe SAC prepared via the pulsing H2-pyrolysis approach. The Fe SAC-nanomotor is powered by decomposing H2O2 with ultrahigh-density Fe atoms, achieving a velocity of 18 ± 3 μm s−1 at a low fuel concentration of 10 mM. This proof-of-principle SAC-nanomotor, with the smallest possible catalytic combustion site and excellent biocompatibility, illustrates the enormous potential of SACs for developing advanced nanomotor systems.

Abstract: Summary
In general, molecular interactions with high binding affinities are preferred when constructing self-assembly systems. Herein, we demonstrate that weak non-covalent interactions, although not advantageous in constructing thermodynamically stable assemblies, can play a vital role in regulating assembly kinetics. Positively charged polymer poly(lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL-g-PEG) can enrich DNA strands and lower the activation barrier for DNA strand displacements. The acceleration effect versus affinity between polymers and DNA follows a volcano-like plot, akin to the law governing catalysts in covalent synthesis. Optimal acceleration is achieved when the affinity is neither too strong nor too weak (around 105 to 107 M−1). In this case, polymer-catalyzed DNA strand displacement follows an assembly-while-bound mechanism. Due to relatively weak and dynamic binding, DNA strands reversibly associate with and dissociate from PLL-g-PEG, enabling conformational adjustments of DNA that facilitate strand displacement. The volcano relationship and assembly-while-bound mechanism relying on weak interactions may be widely applicable in designing catalyzed-assembly systems.

Abstract: Introduction
Different factors affect the quality and viability of cord blood stem cells, and therefore the efficacy of umbilical cord stem cell transplantation. Fetal distress is one factor affecting the quantity of CD34+ cells in cord blood. This study was designed to compare the viability and yield of the umbilical cord blood stem cells of women who have undergone emergency lower segment caesarean section for fetal distress or for other causes.
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional analytical study was performed at a tertiary care hospital facility with a total sample size of 68: 34 participants had undergone emergency C-section for fetal distress, and 34 had undergone emergency C-section for other causes. Umbilical cord blood was collected ex-utero in a 350 mL bag with citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution with adenine. Three milliliter of blood were transferred to an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube for cell counts and flow cytometry testing for CD34+. The chi-square test was used to compare the total mononuclear cell, CD34+, and viability between the groups.
Results
The CD34+ count [mean 4.9 versus 1.1 (× 106 cells/unit)] and total nucleated cell count [mean 14.2 versus 7.5 (× 108/unit)] were significantly higher in cord blood units collected from women who delivered by C-section for fetal distress (p-value <0.05). However, the volume of umbilical cord stem cells and viability of stem cells did not vary significantly based on the presence or absence of fetal distress (p-value >0.05).
Conclusion
The current study shows that umbilical cord blood collected during fetal distress has a significantly higher content of stem cells and total nucleated cells than the non-fetal distress group

Abstract: We analyzed actin cytoskeleton alterations during NET extrusion by neutrophil-like dHL-60 cells and human neutrophils in the absence of DNase1 containing serum to avoid chromatin degradation and microfilament disassembly. NET-formation by dHL-60 cells and neutrophils was induced by Ionomycin or phorbol-12-myristat-13-acetate (PMA). Subsequent staining with anti-actin and TRITC-phalloidin showed depolymerization of the cortical F-actin at spatially confined areas, the NET extrusion sites, effected by transient activation of the monooxygenase MICAL-1 supported by the G-actin binding proteins cofilin, profilin, thymosin ß4 and probably the F-actin fragmenting activity of gelsolin and/or its fragments, which also decorated the formed NETs. MICAL-1 itself appeared to be proteolyzed by neutrophil elastase possibly to confine its activity to the NET-extrusion area. The F-actin oxidization activity of MICAL-1 is inhibited by Levosimendan leading to reduced NET-formation. Anti-gasdermin-D immunohistochemistry showed a cytoplasmic distribution in non-stimulated cells. After stimulation the NET-extrusion pore displayed reduced anti-gasdermin-D staining but accumulated underneath the plasma membrane of the remaining cell body. A similar distribution was observed for myosin that concentrated together with cortical F-actin along the periphery of the remaining cell body suggesting force production by acto-myosin interactions supporting NET expulsion as indicated by the inhibitory action of the myosin ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin. Isolated human neutrophils displayed differences in their content of certain cytoskeletal proteins. After stimulation neutrophils with high gelsolin content preferentially formed “cloud”-like NETs, whereas those with low or no gelsolin formed long “filamentous” NETs.

Abstract: Summary
Valvular heart diseases are commonly addressed by the implantation of heart valve replacement devices; however, current prosthetics remain suboptimal in their performance and longevity, often necessitating multiple operations. Here, structurally reinforced polymeric heart valves are fabricated, utilizing a combination of dip coating and 4-axis three-dimensional printing with different grades of elastomeric polyurethanes. This strategy introduces mechanical anisotropy, increases toughness nearly 9-fold, and enhances fatigue resistance with a 150% increase in the energy required for tear propagation. While all valves exceed the ISO 5840-2 standard, structural reinforcement prevents the progression of tears during accelerated cardiac cycling and reduces regurgitation by about 50% compared with unreinforced valves without compromising opening performance. Subsequently, we demonstrate a valved conduit to broaden the possible clinical applications of this design. These structurally reinforced polymeric heart valve replacements could offer improved device performance and resistance against tear propagation, thus providing a vital window for necessary clinical interventions.

Abstract: The nervous and immune systems are highly developed, and each performs specialized physiological functions. However, they work together, and their dysfunction is associated with various diseases. Specialized molecules, such as neurotransmitters, cytokines, and more general metabolites, are essential for the appropriate regulation of both systems. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, is converted into functional molecules such as serotonin and kynurenine, both of which play important roles in the nervous and immune systems. The role of kynurenine metabolites in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases has recently received particular attention. Recently, we found that hyperactivity of the kynurenine pathway is a critical risk factor for septic shock. In this review, we first outline neuroimmune interactions and tryptophan derivatives and then summarized the changes in tryptophan metabolism in neurological disorders. Finally, we discuss the potential of tryptophan derivatives as therapeutic targets for neuroimmune disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae is known for its increased extracellular polysaccharide production. Biofilm matrices of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae have increased polysaccharide abundance and are uniquely susceptible to disruption by peptide bactenecin 7 (bac7 (1–35)). Here, using confocal microscopy, we show that polysaccharides within the biofilm matrix collapse following bac7 (1–35) treatment. This collapse led to the release of cells from the biofilm, which were then killed by the peptide. Characterization of truncated peptide analogs revealed that their interactions with polysaccharide were responsible for the biofilm matrix changes that accompany bac7 (1–35) treatment. Ultraviolet photodissociation mass spectrometry with the parental peptide or a truncated analog bac7 (10–35) reveal the important regions for bac7 (1–35) complexing with polysaccharides. Finally, we tested bac7 (1–35) using a murine skin abscess model and observed a significant decrease in the bacterial burden. These findings unveil the potential of bac7 (1–35) polysaccharide interactions to collapse K. pneumoniae biofilms.

Abstract: Summary
High-performance, ultra-sensitive, and universal protein post-translational modification (PTM) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) technologies are eagerly pursued in the pharmaceutical industry and bioanalytical research. Novel PTM and PPI detection methods outperform traditional assays in scope and scalability, enabling the collection of information on multiple biochemical targets. Detecting peptides and proteins at the single-molecule level is done by utilizing nanosized transducing elements and assaying solutions at very high analyte concentrations, in the nanomolar range or higher. Here, a proof of principle of a biosensing platform for single-molecule PTM detection is demonstrated. This platform is based on the single molecule with a large transistor (SiMoT) technology, encompassing a millimeter-sized electrolyte-gated organic field-effect transistor, for label-free PTM detection with a zeptomolar limit of detection. Sensitivity is improved 106- to 1012-fold compared with mass-spectrometry and luminescence-based assay methods. A functional assay for detecting enzyme-driven peptide PTMs in the zeptomolar concentration range is demonstrated using multivariate data processing, opening the way for future applications to monitor PTMs.

Abstract: Summary
Radio-frequency (RF) devices are an indispensable component in wireless communication systems. Developing high-strength, cost-effective RF devices with good performance on irregular surfaces is very important but remains highly challenging. Here, we report a dynamic variable-stiffness polymer with high mechanical strength, shape-memory behavior, and recyclability by introducing multiple dynamic cross-linking interactions (coordination bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, and chain entanglements). Leveraging the unique characteristics of the polymer, we fabricate several shape-adaptive RF devices and a backscatter communication system through the ultra-low-cost planar manufacturing process. These RF components can be fitted to various irregular surfaces when heated and retain their shape with high mechanical strength after cooling. In addition to simultaneously offering mechanical robustness and conformal capability, these devices possess high electromagnetic performance as well as self-healing and recyclable properties. We believe that such shape-adaptive RF devices hold great potential in robots, intelligent aircraft, wearable electronic systems, and more.

Abstract: Summary
Harnessing the untapped potential of solar energy sources is crucial for achieving a sustainable future, and accurate maximum-power-point tracking of solar cells is vital to maximizing their power generation. This article introduces a power-tracking algorithm and cost-effective hardware for long-term operational stability measurements in perovskite solar cells. Existing algorithms for photovoltaic technology lead to suboptimal performance when applied to the most stable perovskite devices (for example, triple-mesoscopic hole-transport-material-free metal halide perovskite solar cells). To address this challenge, we developed a low-cost hardware solution for research purposes that enables concurrent long-term stability measurements in parallel with a galvanostatic-type power-tracking algorithm, ensuring superior operational performance for high-hysteresis perovskite solar cells. The suggested enhancements bear significant implications for the extensive integration of perovskite solar-cell technologies, particularly those dependent on power-optimizer devices.

Abstract: Summary
As an anti-counterfeiting technology, physical unclonable function (PUF) is irreplaceable in addressing security risks in the Internet of Things. However, limited by the fixed structural shape, PUF security cannot be further improved. Here, we present a 5D spin-PUF with three sensing effects and two spatial parameters as encoding parameters. The free transformation of the spin state is regulated for dynamic anti-counterfeiting. Fabricated by the self-developed laser-induced technology, the 5D coding base units are composed with random crystal direction, height, and concentration of SiC nanocrystals with spin structures. Spin states are manipulated by temperature, magnetic fields, and microwaves as three additional dimensions. The number of challenge-response pairs increases exponentially to 4,097 with an encoding capacity of 1027,310,000. With an excellent Hamming distance and low autocorrelation coefficient, the recognition accuracy reaches more than 94% using DenseNet. Additionally, we demonstrate unique real-time anti-counterfeiting of product state information. It could potentially be a next-generation security strategy.

Abstract: Background
Hemolysis due to ABO incompatibility is an important differential diagnosis in newborns presenting with jaundice. Clinical studies evaluating ABO hemolytic disease of fetus and newborn (ABO-HDFN) question the diagnostic value of the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) in this situation.
Goals
To determine the clinical and laboratorial findings associated with the occurrence of ABO-HDFN and to evaluate the accuracy of DAT as a diagnostic tool.
Methods
This was a nested case control study with a cohort of 4122 newborns. Clinical and immunohematological data were retrieved from medical files including clinical and laboratorial factors associated with ABO-HDFN. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of positive DAT were calculated.
Results
Among the 4122 newborns, 44 had the diagnosis of ABO-HDFN. Positive DAT, group O mother and group A newborn were significantly associated with the occurrence of neonatal jaundice and this association persisted in a multivariable model (p-value <0.001). DAT presented 65.85 % sensitivity, 96.28 % specificity, 16.9 % PPV and 99.6 % NPV for the diagnosis of ABO-HDFN. There were no cases of positive DAT in cases other than O/A and O/B incompatibilities. The newborn hemoglobin was significantly lower in O/A incompatibility (p-value <0.001).
Conclusion
Positive DAT, mother of group O and newborn of group A are independent risk factors associated with ABO-HDFN. DAT exhibited high NPV for the diagnosis of this complication. Thus, performing DAT in newborns with O/A and O/B incompatibilities is a cost-effective strategy that can be applied as routine by blood banks.

Abstract: Background
COVID-19 convalescent plasma is one of the experimental therapies used widely in moderately sick COVID-19 patients. However, there are a few risks involved in plasma transfusion; notably, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) caused by antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA). This study was designed to assess the prevalence of anti-HLA antibodies in convalescent plasma donors using the single antigen bead method.
Study design and methods
This was a hospital-based observational study of consecutive plasma donors. A total of 252 samples were screened for anti-HLA Class I and Class II antibodies using the microbead assay with the identification of anti-HLA Ab in positive samples being performed using a single antigen bead assay. Luminex-based normalized background cutoff ratios of 10.8 for Class I and 6.9 for Class II and mean fluorescence intensity cutoffs of 2500 for Class I and 1500 for Class II were used for screening and the single bead assay, respectively.
Results
Of 252 screened samples, 28 (11.1 %) were positive for Class I, Class II or both Class I and Class II anti-HLA antibodies in donors with no history of a previous immunizing event. Moreover, 20/252 (7.9%) donors without any history of prior immunization had specific anti-HLA antibodies of Class I or Class II or both by the single bead assay.
Conclusions
The high prevalence of anti-HLA antibodies in our cohort of donors raises an urgent and immediate need for anti-HLA antibody screening in all convalescent plasma donors for safe therapy of COVID-19 patients.

Abstract: Summary
The fusicoccane diterpenoids have triggered particular interest from the organic synthesis community in recent years, owing to their promising biological profiles and complex chemical structures. Here, we report collective, asymmetric total syntheses of five fusicoccane diterpenoids, namely fusicoauritone, fusicogigantones A and B, fusicogigantepoxide, and anadensin. This work features a Yu [5+2+1] cycloaddition that is shown to be a swift approach to access the [5,8]-bicyclic ring system and an oxidative Nazarov cyclization that facilely fabricated the critical cyclopentenone moiety via an unfunctionalized tertiary divinyl carbinol (TDC) substrate. The substrate scope study of the oxidative Nazarov cyclization also revealed a general and robust transformation that is capable of synthesizing highly substituted cyclopentenones via unfunctionalized TDCs.

Abstract: Despite extensive research, targeted delivery of substances to the brain still poses a great challenge due to the selectivity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Most molecules require either carrier- or receptor-mediated transport systems to reach the central nervous system (CNS). These transport systems form attractive routes for the delivery of therapeutics into the CNS, yet the number of known brain endothelium-enriched receptors allowing the transport of large molecules into the brain is scarce. Therefore, to identify novel BBB targets, we combined transcriptomic analysis of human and murine brain endothelium and performed a complex screening of BBB-enriched genes according to established selection criteria. As a result, we propose the high-affinity cationic amino acid transporter 1 (SLC7A1) as a novel candidate for transport of large molecules across the BBB. Using RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization assays, we demonstrated elevated SLC7A1 gene expression in both human and mouse brain endothelium. Moreover, we confirmed SLC7A1 protein expression in brain vasculature of both young and aged mice. To assess the potential of SLC7A1 as a transporter for larger proteins, we performed internalization and transcytosis studies using a radiolabelled or fluorophore-labelled anti-SLC7A1 antibody. Our results showed that SLC7A1 internalised a SLC7A1-specific antibody in human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cells. Moreover, transcytosis studies in both immortalised human brain endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cells and primary mouse brain endothelial cells clearly demonstrated that SLC7A1 effectively transported the SLC7A1-specific antibody from luminal to abluminal side. Therefore, here in this study, we present for the first time the SLC7A1 as a novel candidate for transport of larger molecules across the BBB.

Abstract: Anemia is a pathological condition in which the hemoglobin and red blood cell mass decrease; it is mainly defined by the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood. The World Health Organization guidelines establish specific values to define anemia in different population groups. Early detection of anemia can also be a valuable indicator of underlying medical conditions. Clinical studies have explored the relationship between perioperative anemia and morbidity, highlighting the need for more judicious therapeutic strategies, such as the use of Patient Blood Management, which aims to prevent and treat anemia in a personalized and effective way. Patient Blood Management emerges as a promising approach to dealing with anemia, recognizing that its correction through transfusion always carries risks and that personalized prevention and treatment can offer better outcomes for patients.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advancements in flexible strain sensors utilizing nanomaterials and advanced carbon materials have showcased remarkable sensitivity, promising vast application potential. However, achieving a superior gauge factor (GF) with exceptional outstanding stability at a controllable strain range is still a critical challenge. We introduce the “soft break mechanism,” which enables reversible resistance switching through graphene interlayer displacement and rGO laminate (CPLs) distance variation. Utilizing polyurethane films as anchors, sandwiched with graphene layers, protects the graphene within the soft break range. The GFs can reach the 106–107 level and maintain stability in 10,000 tensile cycles. Adjusting pre-set artificial cracks modifies the abrupt variation point, achieving controllable strain range. Especially, gravitational wave detection can be enabled by our sensors with a strain of 10−21 leading to a resistance change of 1.03×10−7Ω. Our work can enable super sensitivity sensors for potential future subtle signal detection and scientific systems.

Abstract: Summary
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (rMBs) are regarded as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries but are hindered by low cycling stability and sluggish kinetics at present. Herein, we report a sandwich-structured CuS/hNCNC@rGO cathode for rMBs by immobilizing CuS nanoparticles on the hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (hNCNCs) followed by wrapping the reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The charge/discharge mechanism is established based on the unique mixed-valence CuS double-salt structure, i.e., Cu2+S22−⋅Cu+2S2−, which was neglected in the previous studies of CuS-based rMBs. The cathode achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 285 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, an outstanding rate capability of 158 mAh g−1 at 1,000 mA g−1, and ultralong cycling stability at room temperature, superior to most reported cathode materials to date. This study provides a fundamental understanding on the Mg storage mechanism of CuS and suggests a promising strategy for constructing high-performance conversion-type cathodes for rMBs.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochemical degradation of solid electrolytes is a major roadblock in the development of solid-state batteries. Combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterization, first-principles simulations, and machine learning, here we report the atomic-scale oxidative degradation mechanisms of sulfide electrolytes using Li3PS4 (LPS) as a model system. The degradation begins with a decrease of Li neighbor affinity to S atoms, followed by the formation of S-S bonds as the PS4 tetrahedron deforms. After the first cycle, the PS4 motifs become strongly distorted, and PS3 motifs start to form. The distortion of PS4 and the formation of S-S bonds are correlated with an increased interfacial impedance. We identify the spectral fingerprints of the local structural evolution and use them as a proxy for the electrochemical stability of phosphorus sulfide electrolytes, as demonstrated in argyrodite Li6PS5Cl. This study provides guidance for controlling macroscopic reactions through microstructural engineering and can advance the rational design of sulfide electrolytes.

Abstract: Summary
Ceramics that are thermally conductive and can be sintered at low temperatures are particularly desired for hybrid integration and co-fired technology in upsurging high-frequency communication applications. However, a seemingly contradictory relation between high thermal conductivity and low sintering temperature remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report that densified and oriented boron nitride (BN)-based ceramic composites that are sintered at ultralow temperatures (e.g., 150°C) exhibit an ultrahigh thermal conductivity (42 W m−1 K−1), far outperforming current state-of-the-art low-temperature ceramics. We reveal by experiments and simulations that the high thermal conductivity of the ceramic composites is attributable to a high density and high orientation of BN platelets that were previously unattainable at low temperatures, as further supported by our newly developed theoretical model. Coupled with simultaneously achieved excellent microwave dielectric properties, this work opens up a new avenue to high-thermal-conductivity ceramics that are integrable with high-power devices at low temperatures.

Abstract: Summary
Transition-metal-catalyzed allylation of azlactones represents an elegant strategy for the synthesis of valuable α-quaternary amino acids. While much progress has been achieved, catalytic prenylation and reverse prenylation of azlactones have been less explored. Regiodivergent catalysis, aiming at attaining distinct regioisomers from the same starting materials through varying the catalyst, is an emerging strategy in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present an atom-economical coupling of azlactones and isoprene with palladium catalysis in which ligand-controlled regiodivergence is achieved. With monophosphine PPhCy2 as ligand, reverse-prenylated azlactones are produced, while the selectivity switches to prenylation when varying to bisphosphine ligand dppe. The regiodivergence relies on tuning the coordination environment and steric effects. Initial rate kinetic analysis suggests a change in the rate-determining step induced by the optimal ligand. Furthermore, this protocol provides an expedient entry point to access quaternary-prenylated and reverse-prenylated amino acids, which have potential in the incorporation of peptides.

Abstract: Summary
Nature has already suggested bioinspired functions. Beyond them, adaptive and trainable functions could be the inspiration for novel responsive soft matter beyond the state-of-the-art classic static bioinspired, stimulus-responsive, and shape-memory materials. Here, we describe magnetic assembly/disassembly of electrically conducting soft ferromagnetic nickel colloidal particles into surface topographical pillars for bistable electrical trainable memories. They allow magnetic sensing with adaptable and rescalable sensitivity ranges, enabled by bistable memories and kinetic concepts inspired by biological sensory adaptations. Based on the soft ferromagnetism of the nanogranular composition and the resulting rough particle surfaces prepared via a solvothermal synthesis, triggerable structural memory is achieved by the magnetic field-driven particle assembly and disassembly, promoted by interparticle jamming. Electrical conversion from current to frequency for electrical spikes facilitates rescalable and trainable frequency-based sensitivity on magnetic fields. This work suggests an avenue for designing trainable and adaptable life-inspired materials, for example, for soft robotics and interactive autonomous devices.

Abstract: Postoperative anemia is a complex clinical issue that requires attention due to its ramifications on the patient's recovery and prognosis. Originating from multiple determinants, such as intraoperative blood loss, hemolysis, nutritional deficiencies, systemic inflammation and impact on the bone marrow, postoperative anemia has varied and often challenging presentations. Patients undergoing major surgical procedures, in particular, are susceptible to developing anemia due to the considerable associated blood loss. Accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in the approach, requiring meticulous hematological analysis, including hemoglobin, hematocrit and reticulocyte count, as well as an in-depth investigation of the underlying causes. An additional challenge arises in the form of the excessive practice of phlebotomy during hospitalization for clinical monitoring. Although it is essential to assess the progression of anemia, frequent removal of blood may contribute to iatrogenic anemia, further delaying recovery and possibly increasing susceptibility to infection.

Abstract: Yeast Rho5 is a small GTPase which mediates the response to nutrient and oxidative stress, and triggers mitophagy and apoptosis. We here studied the rapid translocation of a GFP-tagged Rho5 to mitochondria under such stress conditions by live-cell fluorescence microscopy in the background of strains lacking different mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (MOMP). Fun14, Msp1 and Alo1 were found to be required for efficient recruitment of the GTPase, whereas translocation of Dck1 and Lmo1, the subunits of its dimeric GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF), remained unaffected. An influence of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) Por1 on the association of GFP-Rho5 with mitochondria under oxidative stress conditions appeared to be strain-dependent. However, epistasis analyses and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) studies indicate a genetic and physical interaction. All four strains lacking a single MOMP were investigated for their effect on mitophagy.

Abstract: Airway epithelial cells form a physical barrier against inhaled pathogens and coordinate innate immune responses in the lungs. Bronchial cells in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) are colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa because of the accumulation of mucus in the lower airways and an altered immune response. This leads to chronic inflammation, lung tissue damage, and accelerated decline in lung function. Thus, identifying the molecular factors involved in the host response in the airways is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies. The septin (SEPT) cytoskeleton is involved in tissue barrier integrity and anti-infective responses. SEPT7 is critical for maintaining SEPT complexes and for sensing pathogenic microbes. In the lungs, SEPT7 may be involved in the epithelial barrier resistance to infection; however, its role in cystic fibrosis (CF) P. aeruginosa infection is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of SEPT7 in controlling P. aeruginosa infection in bronchial epithelial cells, particularly in CF. The study findings showed that SEPT7 encages P. aeruginosa in bronchial epithelial cells and its inhibition downregulates the expression of other SEPTs. In addition, P. aeruginosa does not regulate SEPT7 expression. Finally, we found that inhibiting SEPT7 expression in bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B 16HBE14o- and primary cells) resulted in higher levels of internalized P. aeruginosa and decreased IL-6 production during infection, suggesting a crucial role of SEPT7 in the host response against this bacterium. However, these effects were not observed in the CF cells (16HBE14o-/F508del and primary cells) which may explain the persistence of infection in pwCF. The study findings suggest the modification of SEPT7 expression as a potential approach for the anti-infective control of P. aeruginosa, particularly in CF.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how different networks relate to each other is key for understanding complex systems. We introduce an intuitive yet powerful framework to disentangle different ways in which networks can be (dis)similar and complementary to each other. We decompose the shortest paths between nodes as uniquely contributed by one source network, or redundantly by either, or synergistically by both together. Our approach considers the networks’ full topology, providing insights at multiple levels of resolution: from global statistics to individual paths. Our framework is widely applicable across scientific domains, from public transport to brain networks. In humans and 124 other species, we demonstrate the prevalence of unique contributions by long-range white-matter fibers in structural brain networks. Across species, efficient communication also relies on significantly greater synergy between long-range and short-range fibers than expected by chance. Our framework could find applications for designing network systems or evaluating existing ones.

Abstract: Background
Autologous stem cell transplantation is a treatment modality for several diseases. Prediction of successful mobilization may be useful to optimize hematopoietic stem cell collection.
Study design and methods
This was a retrospective study with data from transplantation candidates between September 2015 and December 2021 being analyzed. The medical record of each patient was reviewed to mine mobilization information. The laboratory data analyzed were CD34+ cell enumeration and pre-collection peripheral blood cell count. The primary outcome, good mobilization, was defined as a CD34+ cell count ≥20/μL.
Results
This study included 807 patients. Increased patient weight, low mean corpuscular volume, high nucleated red blood cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cell and immature granulocyte counts were significantly associated with good mobilization. In addition, patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma were two times more likely to be good mobilizers than patients with lymphoma. The model was applied to a validation set to identify patients who underwent apheresis (CD34+ cell count ≥10 µL), resulting in a sensitivity of 69 %, a specificity of 95 %, positive predictive value of 98 %, and a negative predictive value of 50 %.
Conclusion
Success in mobilization was greater in patients who underwent the first mobilization cycle and who had a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Furthermore, higher body weight, and nucleated red blood cells, immature granulocytes and mononuclear cell counts, as well as low mean corpuscular volumes, were associated with successful mobilization.

Abstract: Introduction
Common side effects after stem cell transplantation (SCT), such as anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, can disrupt the quality of life of patients. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of self-care education with smart phone applications on the severity of nausea and vomiting after SCT in leukemia patients.
Materials and methods
In this clinical trial study, using the blocked randomization method 104 leukemia patients undergoing SCT were assigned to two groups, intervention and control. The patients of the Control Group received routine care, and the Intervention Group received self-care education with a smart mobile phone application, in addition to routine care. Two weeks, one month, and three months after the start of the intervention, the severity of nausea and vomiting was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Khavar Oncology scale, both of which were completed by both Control and Intervention Groups. Data were analyzed using chi-square, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney, and Friedman tests using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25 software.
Results
The severity of nausea and vomiting in leukemia patients undergoing SCT was significantly different in the two groups at all three timepoints (two weeks, one month, and three months) after transplantation (p-value = 0.000).
Conclusion
The severity of nausea and vomiting after SCT in leukemia patients was improved by self-care education with a smart phone application. Therefore, this method is recommended to reduce the severity of nausea and vomiting in leukemia patients who undergo transplantation.

Abstract: Background
Regarding the close association between neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and occurrence of pathological jaundice as a cause of neurotoxicity and kernicterus, the present study aimed to evaluate the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia.
Methods
A retrospective case-control study of blood group O mothers and their ABO and Rh newborns was conducted. Medical records that included total serum bilirubin levels of 79 patients with hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) from between 2017 and 2020 were reviewed. Neonates who were eligible to receive immunoglobulin based on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines were classified as cases and the rest were included as the Control Group.
Results
The mean total bilirubin in relation to hemoglobin levels in IVIG-treated neonates was significantly lower than in non-IVIG-treated neonates (13.98 ± 4.23 mg/dL versus 16.61 ± 2.68 mg/dL; p-value = 0.002). Although females had longer hospitalizations in both IVIG-treated (3.81 ± 1.28 versus 3.54 ± 1.30 days; p-value = 0.509) and non-IVIG-treated (3.43 ± 0.811 versus 3.19 ± 0.75 days; p-value = 0.361) groups compared to males, this difference was not significant between the groups. Although four neonates with ABO incompatibility required packed red blood cells, all infants were managed medically and no deaths occurred during the course of treatment. Moreover, no exchange transfusion or adverse effects of IVIG were observed.
Conclusion
The results from the present study revealed that IVIG administration is a useful procedure for the management of bilirubin encephalopathy with greater opportunity to reduce exchange transfusion requirements for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

Abstract: Summary
Recreating tissue environments with precise control over mechanical, biochemical, and cellular organization is essential for next-generation tissue models for drug discovery, development studies, and the replication of disease environments. However, controlling these properties at cell-scale lengths remains challenging. Here, we report the development of printing approaches that leverage polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels containing photocaged oligonucleotides to spatially program material characteristics with non-destructive, non-ultraviolet light. We further integrate this system with a perfusion chamber to allow us to alter the composition of PEGDA hydrogels while retaining common light-activatable photocaged DNAs. We demonstrate that the hydrogels can capture DNA functionalized materials, including cells coated with complementary oligonucleotides with spatial control using biocompatible wavelengths. Overall, these materials open pathways to orthogonal capture of any DNA functionalized materials while not changing the sequences of the DNA.

Abstract: Summary
One of the challenges associated with the use of hydrogen is its storage and transportation. Hydrogen pipelines are an essential infrastructure for transporting hydrogen from offshore production sites to onshore distribution centers. This paper presents an innovative analysis of the pressure drops, velocity profile, and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) in various hydrogen transportation scenarios, examining the influence of pipeline type (steel vs. composite), diameter, and outlet pressure. The role of the compressor and the pipeline, individually and together, was assessed for 1,000 and 100 tons of hydrogen. Notably, the LCOH was highly sensitive to these parameters, with the compressor contribution ranging between 21.52% and 85.11% and the pipeline’s share varying from 14.89% to 78.48%. The outflow pressure and diameter of the pipeline have a significant impact on the performance: when 1,000 tons of hydrogen is transported, the internal pressure drop ranges from 2 to 30 bar and the flow velocity can vary between 2 and 25 m/s. For equivalent hydrogen quantities, the composite pipeline exhibits the same trends but with minor variations in the specific values.

Abstract: Background
Sickle cell disease (SCD) comprises a heterogeneous group of inherited hemolytic disorders that increases the risk of maternal and perinatal complications due to chronic systemic inflammatory response, endothelial damage and vaso-occlusion. The contribution of genotypes to the severity of outcomes during pregnancy is not completely established.
Methods
A retrospective study of medical charts was performed to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes in Hb SS, Hb SC disease and sickle-beta thalassemia (Hb Sβ) pregnancies followed at a high-risk antenatal care unit over a 6-year period. A descriptive analysis of morphological findings was performed of the placenta when pathology reports were available.
Results
Sixty-two SCD pregnant women [25 Hb SS (40 %), 29 Hb SC (47 %) and 8 Hb Sβ (13 %)] were included. Overall, SCD was associated with maternal complications (77 %), preterm birth (30 %), cesarean section (80 %) and a need of blood transfusion. In general there were no statistically significant differences between genotypes. The only significant difference was the hemoglobin level at first antenatal care visit which was lower for the homozygous genotype (7.7 g/dL) compared to Hb SC and Hb Sβ (9.7 g/dL and 8.4 g/dL, respectively; p-value = 0.01). Ten of 15 evaluated placentas showed abnormal morphological findings
Conclusion
SCD, regardless of the underlying genotype, is associated with increased adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes and placental abnormalities associated with maternal vascular malperfusion.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that are promising for cartilage tissue engineering secrete high amounts of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an immunoactive mediator involved in endochondral bone development. This study aimed to identify drivers of PGE2 and its role in the inadvertent MSC misdifferentiation into hypertrophic chondrocytes. PGE2 release, which rose in the first three weeks of MSC chondrogenesis, was jointly stimulated by endogenous BMP, WNT, and hedgehog activity that supported the exogenous stimulation by TGF-β1 and insulin to overcome the PGE2 inhibition by dexamethasone. Experiments with PGE2 treatment or the inhibitor celecoxib or specific receptor antagonists demonstrated that PGE2, although driven by prohypertrophic signals, exerted broad autocrine antihypertrophic effects. This chondroprotective effect makes PGE2 not only a promising option for future combinatorial approaches to direct MSC tissue engineering approaches into chondral instead of endochondral development but could potentially have implications for the use of COX-2-selective inhibitors in osteoarthritis pain management.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanical metamaterials have demonstrated their potential as programmable structural materials with tailorable deformative responses. The existing mechanical metamaterials have exhibited their potential to mimic certain flowers; however, it is of interest to expand the mimicry from morphological imitation in the spatial dimension (i.e., unchangeable over time) to multifunctional biomimicry in the spatiotemporal dimension. Here, we report the origami metamaterial biomimetic bouquets that combine biomimicry with information processing over time for floriography in the spatiotemporal 4D. The origami metamaterial bouquets not only mimic the key characteristics of the lily’s growing process (i.e., bud and bloom) but, more innovatively, also expand traditional floriography from the time-independent information expression (i.e., species, color, and quantity) in the spatial dimension to the fourth information dimension of changeable status through binary digital abstraction. This research opens a horizon for bio-inspired intelligent devices and information systems through rationally designing and assembling the new-generation origami mechanical metamaterials.

Abstract: Autologous blood transfusion can be achieved through different techniques, including by the patient donating blood before surgery (pre-deposit), collecting blood from the patient immediately before the operation and replacing the volume with colloids or plasma expanders (acute normovolemic hemodilution) or through the salvage of lost blood, during or immediately after surgery, and its retransfusion after washing (intraoperative or postoperative recovery). We will focus on the two methods used intraoperatively that are of fundamental importance in the management and conservation of the patient's own blood.

Abstract: Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia of variable severity. Nine Polish patients with severe hemolytic anemia but normal PK activity were found to carry mutations in the PKLR gene encoding PK, five already known ones and one novel (c.178C > T). We characterized two of the known variants by molecular modeling (c.1058delAAG) and minigene splicing analysis (c.101-1G > A). The former gives a partially destabilized PK tetramer, likely of suboptimal activity, and the c.101-1G > A variant gives alternatively spliced mRNA carrying a premature stop codon, encoding a severely truncated PK and likely undergoing nonsense-mediated decay.

Abstract: The 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST) is a protein persulfidase, occurring mainly in mitochondria. Although function of this protein in cancer cells has been already studied, no clear outcome can be postulated up to now. Therefore, we focused on the determination of function of MPST in colon (HCT116 cells)/colorectal (DLD1 cells) cancers. In silico analysis revealed that in gastrointestinal cancers, MPST together with its binding partners can be either of a high risk or might have a protective effect. Silencing of MPST gene resulted in decreased ATP, while acetyl-CoA levels were elevated. Increased apoptosis was detected in cells with silenced MPST gene, which was accompanied by decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, but no changes in IP3 receptor’s protein. Mitochondria underwent activation of fission and elevated DRP1 expression after MPST silencing. Proliferation and migration of DLD1 and HCT116 cells were markedly affected, showing the importance of MPST protein in colon/colorectal cancer development.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) as membrane-bound particles released by various cells are potential tools for diagnosis and treatment. Blood cells, particularly platelets, are the source of circulating EVs.
Material
EVs were enriched with gradient ultracentrifugation and measured by nanoparticle tracking assay. A flow cytometric multiplex assay was used for cellular source determination. Activation of platelets was measured as a percentage of CD62p+/CD61+ platelets and correlated with the concentration and size of released EVs.
Results
In general there was no statistically significant correlation between EVs` concentration and degree of platelet activation. EVs from different cellular sources were detected. Comparing different needle thicknesses, there was a decrease in the EVs concentration for the 16G needle versus the 21G needle, but no difference was observed for EVs` size and phenotype or platelets activation. During blood storage, platelet activation increased, but there was no effect on the EVs` concentration, size, or phenotype.
Conclusions
Preanalytical factors like needle thickness and storage time can affect the MVs' properties. Activation of platelets during blood collection or blood storage occurs; however, it is difficult to determine its effect on the physiological properties of EVs since the mechanisms of EVs` biogenesis and especially clearness are not precisely known.

Abstract: Cell shape and motility are determined by the cytoskeleton, an interpenetrating network of actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. The biophysical properties of each filament type individually have been studied extensively by cell-free reconstitution. By contrast, the interactions between the three cytoskeletal networks are relatively unexplored. They are coupled via crosslinkers of the plakin family such as plectin. These are challenging proteins for reconstitution because of their giant size and multidomain structure. Here we engineer a recombinant actin-vimentin crosslinker protein called ‘ACTIF’ that provides a minimal model system for plectin, recapitulating its modular design with actin-binding and intermediate filament-binding domains separated by a coiled-coil linker for dimerisation. We show by fluorescence and electron microscopy that ACTIF has a high binding affinity for vimentin and actin and creates mixed actin-vimentin bundles. Rheology measurements show that ACTIF-mediated crosslinking strongly stiffens actin-vimentin composites. Finally, we demonstrate the modularity of this approach by creating an ACTIF variant with the intermediate filament binding domain of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli. Our protein engineering approach provides a new cell-free system for the biophysical characterization of intermediate filament-binding crosslinkers and for understanding the mechanical synergy between actin and vimentin in mesenchymal cells.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate battery lifetime prediction is important for maintenance, warranties, and cell design. However, manufacturing variability and usage-dependent degradation make life prediction challenging. Here, we investigate new features derived from capacity-voltage data in early life to predict the lifetime of cells cycled under varying charge rates, discharge rates, and depths of discharge. The early-life features capture a cell’s state of health and the change rate of component-level degradation modes. Using a newly generated dataset from 225 nickel-manganese-cobalt/graphite lithium-ion cells aged under a wide range of conditions, we demonstrate a lifetime prediction of in-distribution cells with 15.1% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). A hierarchical Bayesian model shows improved performance on extrapolation, achieving 21.8% MAPE for out-of-distribution cells. Our approach highlights the importance of using domain knowledge of battery degradation to inform feature engineering and model construction. Further, a new publicly available battery lifelong aging dataset is provided.

Abstract: Background
Iron overload (IO) is a complex condition in which clinical, behavioral and genetic factors contribute to the phenotype. In multiethnic and non-Caucasian populations, mutations in HFE gene alone cannot explain IO in most of the cases, and additional genetic and environmental factors must be investigated. Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) play a central role in iron homeostasis by modulating HAMP transcription through the signaling pathway that includes SMAD and HJV. In this study, we aimed to explore the clinical relevance of BMP6 mutations in a cohort of Brazilian patients with IO.
Methods
41 patients with IO were evaluated. Blood samples were collected to analyze BMP6 mutations through New Sequence Generations (NGS). Frequency of variants and mutations were analyzed and correlated with clinical and environmental characteristics.
Results
We identified BMP6 mutations in three patients with IO. The p.Arg257His mutation was identified in two patients and the p.Leu71Val mutation was identified in one patient. Two of these patients had additional risk factors for IO (HFE mutations and diabetes mellitus).
Conclusion
BMP6 mutations, when combined to other genetic and clinical risk factors, may contribute to IO. Functional studies and THE evaluation of large cohorts are necessary to fully address BMP6 role in IO.

Abstract: Summary
Topological phonon states in crystalline materials have attracted significant research interests due to their importance for fundamental physical phenomena, yet their implication for phonon thermal transport remains largely unexplored. Here, we use density functional theory calculations and symmetry analyses to explore topological phonon phase transitions under uniaxial strains and their tuning effects on thermal transport in titanium monoxide (TiO). Our calculation shows that the application of 10% tension significantly diminishes lattice thermal conductivity of TiO by 77% and 66% along the a and c axes, respectively, at room temperature. This suppression is found to result largely from the breaking of symmetry-protected degeneracy of acoustic branches, which induces a substantial enhancement of phonon scattering phase space due to the easier fulfillment of scattering selection rules. Our study provides evidence for the importance of phononic band topology in modulating thermal conductivity and offers a promising route toward controlling solid-state heat transport.

Abstract: Summary
Free-standing MXene films are recognized as excellent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding walls owing to their high conductivity, laminate structures, and abundant terminations. Here, we report conjugated polymers of PBTz-SO3Na, PBTz-SO3TBA, and PEDOT:PSS, respectively, electrostatically assembled on interlayer surfaces of Ti3C2Tx MXene generating tunable electric dipoles, accompanied by improvements of conductivity, oxidation resistance, and mechanical stability, to ultimately enhance EMI shielding performance. PEDOT2+ (or TBA+) cations on Ti3C2Tx surfaces induce reversely strong polarized dipoles and enhance conductivity for more electromagnetic wave (EW) attenuation. By increasing the anchored polymers, the enhanced absorption attenuation ensures complete attenuation of incident EW, revealing a dual mechanism of reflection and absorption for EW shielding. At last, the Ti3C2Tx anchored with PEDOT2+ (or TBA+) achieves EMI shielding effectiveness approaching 100 dB at 20-μm thickness. Briefly, multifunctional engineering in electric dipoles between MXene interlayers opens an unexplored avenue for designing efficient EMI shielding materials.

Abstract: Summary
Magnons are fundamental excitations of spin waves in magnetic materials, which are able to carry both heat and spin information. Examining magnon thermal transport is essential for advancing energy-efficient spintronics and novel energy conversion technologies. Unlike the well-established thermal properties of phonons and electrons, the size effect on magnon thermal transport remains elusive. Here, we quantitatively measure the role of grain size on magnon thermal transport in the nanostructured quantum magnet La2CuO4. Samples with controlled grain sizes are synthesized using a bottom-up method. The measured magnon thermal conductivity decreases as the grain size is reduced. Analysis using a two-dimensional magnon transport kinetic model, combined with optical and electrical measurements, suggests that magnon-boundary scattering effectively restricts the magnon mean free path, suppressing magnon thermal conductivity. These results offer valuable insights into the prediction and control of magnon transport at the nanoscale, especially for applications in quantum information processing and energy conversion.

Abstract: Summary
Ocean waves contain abundant renewable kinetic energy, but harnessing their power is difficult due to their low frequency and erratic nature. Here, we report a spherical triboelectric nanogenerator featuring multilayer “sliced-pizza-shaped” electrodes (SP-TENG) to efficiently harness omnidirectional wave energy. Unlike conventional TENGs that either convert kinetic motion from a single direction or compromise energy-harvesting efficiency to capture multi-directional wave energy, our SP-TENG not only effectively harnesses multi-directional wave energy but also maximizes electric output by fully utilizing the device’s internal space. Moreover, using polypropylene fur as a tribo-material further increases the charge output by enhancing inter-material contact efficiency. The SP-TENG effectively captures kinetic energy from all directions, achieving a peak power density of 13 W/m3 and charge density of 2.4 mC/m3 at 0.6 Hz frequency. This study presents a practical and efficient approach for harvesting high-entropy blue energy on a large scale.

Abstract: Summary
Massive spent lithium-ion batteries will peak soon, creating energy, environment, economy, and technology challenges and key metal supply burdens in all resource-relevant industries. Here, we develop a universal energy-effective, sustainable, and easily modularized recycling strategy to retrieve transition metals and lithium from spent cathodes (LiCoO2 and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) via a high-capacity cooperative leaching process. The high-capacity leaching with acid-free sustainable agents is enabled by strong coordination using green deep eutectic solvents and synergistic strong ligand molecules through a concurrent reduction-dissolution and direct coordination mechanism. Importantly, the Al foil current collector, binder, and carbon additives remain non-dissolved under our mild treatment condition and can be easily filtered out, which is vastly more advantageous than conventional hydro/pyrometallurgy processes that involve complicated purification. Furthermore, as a demonstration of high-value applications, we transform the leached solution to high-quality single or ternary atomic catalysts and LiCl, completing the loop for recycling spent battery cathodes.

Abstract: Summary
Upright solar panels (SPs) are exposed to direct sunlight within the restricted trajectory of the sun’s diurnal motion. These SPs encounter varying incident angles depending on the orientation of their faces, which can be large at high latitudes. Here, guided by geometric optics, we design a wedge-shaped microprism sheet for upright SPs to mitigate reflection losses. This microprism sheet achieves a surface reflectance below 0.01 for all incident angles and wavelengths of direct sunlight. Furthermore, ray optics simulations that trace the trajectory of each principal light path through the microprism sheet account for its omnidirectional near-unity transmittance. These optical characteristics enhance the photovoltaic performance of the SPs, yielding a more pronounced increase at larger incident angles as evidenced by indoor and outdoor experiments. Notably, outdoor testing consistently demonstrates the superior performance of upright SPs with a microprism sheet during the daytime, irrespective of the orientation of their faces.

Abstract: Summary
Affinity-based biosensors employing surface-bound biomolecules for analyte detection are important tools in clinical diagnostics and drug development. In this context, electrolyte-gated organic transistors (EGOTs) are emerging as ultrasensitive label-free biosensors. In this study, we present an EGOT sensor integrated within a microfluidic system. The sensor utilizes the cytomegalovirus (CMV) phosphoprotein 65 as a biorecognition element to detect the pathological biomarker human anti-cytomegalovirus antibody in solution. The biorecognition element is grafted onto the gate electrode by exploiting the polyhistidine-tag technology. Real-time monitoring of the EGOT response, coupled with a two-compartment kinetic model analysis, enables the determination of analyte concentration, binding kinetics, and thermodynamics of the interaction. The analysis of the relevant kinetic parameters of the binding process yields a reliable value for the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and suggests that the measured deviations from the Langmuir binding model arise from the co-existence of binding sites with different affinities toward the antibodies.

Abstract: Background
Efficient classification of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) involves considering various factors, such as age, white blood cell count, and chromosomal alterations. However, studying protein markers are crucial to improving T-ALL patients' diagnosis and treatment. A study analyzing the expression of proteomes was conducted to identify promising early-stage biomarkers for T-ALL patients
Methods
Label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze the blood proteins of both patients and healthy individuals to identify new biomarkers for T-ALL. The findings were validated by RT-PCR, ELISA and computational analysis
Results
The study identified 1467 proteins in the blood, of which nine were upregulated and 35 were downregulated by more than 2-fold. T-ALL patients showed a significant increase in specific disease-related proteins, such as eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia protein, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1, cisplatin resistance-associated-overexpressed protein, X-ray radiation resistance-associated protein 1, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10D, protein S100-A8, and copine-4, by more than 3-fold
Conclusion
The findings of this study provide a valuable protein map of leukemic cells and identify potential biomarkers for leukemic aggressiveness. However, further studies using larger T-ALL patient samples must confirm these preliminary results.

Abstract: Epithelial tissues cover the surfaces and lumens of the internal organs of multicellular animals and crucially contribute to internal environment homeostasis by delineating distinct compartments within the body. This vital role is known as epithelial barrier function. Epithelial cells are arranged like cobblestones and intricately bind together to form an epithelial sheet that upholds this barrier function. Central to the restriction of solute and fluid diffusion through intercellular spaces are occluding junctions, tight junctions in vertebrates and septate junctions in invertebrates. As part of epithelial tissues, cells undergo constant renewal, with older cells being replaced by new ones. Simultaneously, the epithelial tissue undergoes relative rearrangement, elongating, and shifting directionally as a whole. The movement or shape changes within the epithelial sheet necessitate significant deformation and reconnection of occluding junctions. Recent advancements have shed light on the intricate mechanisms through which epithelial cells sustain their barrier function in dynamic environments. This review aims to introduce these noteworthy findings and discuss some of the questions that remain unanswered.

Abstract: Background
Circular RNAs (circRNA) are pivotal in hematological diseases. Previous study showed that circ_0014614 (circDAP3) was significantly underexpressed in bone marrow–derived exosomes from essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients, affecting the differentiation of bone marrow lineage cells into megakaryocytes.
Methods
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to display circ_0014614's primary cytoplasmic location in K562 cells. Cytoscape software was used to predict the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks, and their expression at the cellular level was detected by Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was utilized to detect the expression levels of circ_0014614，miR-138-5p and caspase3 mRNA. Western blot was used to determine the protein levels of GATA-1, RUNX-1, NF-E2, CD41 and caspase3. The proliferation of K562 cells was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Assay. Furthermore, the interplay between miR-138-5p and circ_0014614 or caspase3 was elucidated through a Dual-luciferase reporter assay.
Results
FISH assay indicated circ_0014614's primary cytoplasmic location in K562 cells. In ET bone marrow and K562 cells, circ_0014614 and caspase3 were down-regulated, whereas miR-138-5p saw a significant surge. Overexpressing circ_0014614 curtailed K562 cells' proliferation and differentiation. Further, circ_0014614 targeted miR-138-5p, with heightened miR-138-5p levels counteracting circ_0014614's inhibition. MiR-138-5p further targeted caspase3, and caspase3 silencing neutralized suppressed miR-138-5p's effects on K562 cell differentiation.
Conclusion
Circ_0014614 was down-regulated in ET bone marrow and bone marrow lineage cells, and upregulating circ_0014614 can inhibit bone marrow lineage cells' proliferation and differentiation into megakaryocytes. Mechanistically, circ_0014614 functioned as ceRNA via sponging miR-138-5p and alleviated the inhibitory effect of miR-138-5p on its target caspase3, which potentially deters tumor activity in ET.

Abstract: A wide variety of transmembrane signals are transduced by cell-surface receptors that activate intracellular signaling molecules. In particular, receptor clustering in the plasma membrane plays a critical role in these processes. Single-spanning or single-pass transmembrane proteins are among the most significant types of membrane receptors, which include adhesion receptors, such as integrins, CD44, cadherins, and receptor tyrosine kinases. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the activity of these receptors is of great significance. Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a recently emerging paradigm in cellular physiology for the ubiquitous regulation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of various signaling pathways. This study describes the emerging features of transmembrane signaling through single-spanning receptors from the perspective of phase separation. Possible physicochemical modulations of LLPS-based transmembrane signaling are also discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Cotton ovule in vitro cultures are a promising platform for exploring biofabrication of fibers with tailored properties. When the ovules' growth medium is supplemented with chemically synthesized cellulose precursors, it results in their integration into the developing fibers, thereby tailoring their end properties. Here, we report the feeding of synthetic glucosyl phosphate derivative, 6-deoxy-6-fluoro-glucose-1-phosphate (6F-Glc-1P) to cotton ovules growing in vitro, demonstrating the metabolic incorporation of 6F-Glc into the fibers with enhanced mechanical properties and moisture-retention capacity while emphasizing the role of molecular hierarchical architecture in defining functional characteristics and mechanical properties. This incorporation strategy bypasses the early steps of conventional metabolic pathways while broadening the range of functionalities that can be employed to customize fiber end properties. Our approach combines materials science, chemistry, and plant sciences to illustrate the innovation required to find alternative solutions for sustainable production of functional cotton fibers with enhanced and emergent properties.

Abstract: Summary
The activation of CO2 on nickel surfaces is the first step of various CO2 conversion processes. Consequently, understanding the surface intermediates formed during this step and their adsorption sites is crucial for elucidating reaction mechanisms. In this study, we employ in situ infrared spectroscopy to investigate the interaction of 1 mbar CO2 with a model Ni(111) catalyst between 25°C and 300°C. Under these conditions, CO2 is activated via a direct dissociation into CO and atomic oxygen, while the oxidation state of the Ni(111) surface is primarily determined by residual H2 and O2. The high surface coverage of CO and oxygen at ambient CO2 pressure induces a competitive adsorption mechanism on the energetically favored hollow sites. This mechanism leads to a temperature-dependent distribution of CO between top and hollow sites, potentially explaining the effect of reaction conditions on the adsorption site of CO intermediates in CO2 conversion reactions.

Abstract: Summary
Salt solutions have attracted significant interest as water sorbents for a wide range of applications due to their large hygroscopicity and low cost. However, despite their promise, no existing model fully describes the experimentally observed absorption and desorption behavior of salts. Here, we develop a model that accurately captures absorption and desorption of water vapor into salt solutions. Our results show that the nonlinear driving force due to the chemical activity of water leads to previously unexplained behaviors such as faster desorption than absorption and absorption-rate dependence on humidity. We leverage our model to demonstrate the trade-off of uptake and sorption time as the humidity and salt type are changed and show the dependence of the timescale on the system’s parameters. This model represents a fundamental advancement in the understanding of salt solution absorption-desorption and supports the optimization of water sorption applications.

Abstract: Background
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is considered a costly disease. Depending on the risk stratification, the patient may receive consolidation with cycles of intermediate doses of cytarabine, auto-HSCT or allo-HSCT according to availability in each service and the availability of a compatible donor. Literature data indicate that safety and effectiveness do not differ between consolidation therapy with intermediate-dose cytarabine or auto-HSCT, and so the cost can help physicians and health managers in their choice.
Method
The cost of the second consolidation was compared in 18 to 60-year-old patients with de novo AML who were included in the International Consortium of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (ICAML) protocol. Patients treated with auto-HSCT or intermediate doses of cytarabine (IDAC) were analysed during four years using the microcosting methodology.
Results
The mean costs for auto-HSCT and IDAC were BRL$ 34,900.95 (range: 23,611.36–41,229.59) and 15,231.64 (range: 6,546.36–23,253.53), respectively. The mean duration of in-hospital stay was 88.4 (93–133) and 94 (50–153) days, respectively. The mean cost of the four cycles of treatment was BRL$ 114.212,78 for auto-HSCT and BRL$ 121.980,93 for the chemotherapy group. Regardless of the type of treatment, the input that had the greatest economic impact was hospital admission, mainly due to infections.
Conclusion
Auto-HSCT had a lower average cost per patient and hospitalization rate than chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Detecting bacterial viability remains a critical necessity across the pharmaceutical, medical, and food sectors. Yet, a rapid, non-destructive approach for distinguishing between intact live and dead bacteria remains elusive. Here, this work introduces a robust and accessible methodology that integrates atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, quantitative nano-mechanics, and machine learning algorithms to assess the survival of gram-negative (Escherichia coli [E. coli]) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus [S. aureus]) bacteria. The results reveal distinctive changes in ultraviolet-killed E. coli and S. aureus manifesting intact morphological structures but increased stiffness. Three specific features—bacterial deformation, spring constant, and Young’s modulus—extracted from AFM force spectroscopy are established as pivotal inputs for a machine-learning-based stacking classifier. Trained on extensive AFM datasets encompassing known bacterial viability, this methodology demonstrates exceptional predictive accuracy exceeding 95% for both E. coli and S. aureus. These results underscore its universal applicability, rapidity, and non-destructive nature, positioning it as a definitive method for universally detecting bacterial viability.

Abstract: Hemostasis plays a critical role in surgical procedures and is essential for a successful outcome. Advances in hemostatic agents offer new approaches to controlling bleeding thereby making surgeries safer. The appropriate choice of these agents is crucial. Volume replacement, another integral part of Patient Blood Management (PBM), maintains adequate tissue perfusion, preventing cellular damage. Individualization in fluid administration is vital with the choice between crystalloids and colloids depending on each case. Colloids, unlike crystalloids, increase oncotic pressure, contributing to fluid retention in the intravascular space. Understanding these aspects is essential to ensure safe and effective surgery, minimizing complications related to blood loss and maintaining the patient's hemodynamic status.

Abstract: Background/aim
There are several complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Without any doubt, most important of these is aGvHD that increases transplant-related mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate whether ST-2 and Reg3α levels measured at an early stage in pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be individual biomarkers identifying future GvHD and predicting treatment response.
Materials and methods
From January 2019 to January 2021, 27 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency or hematopoietic diseases formed the study group. During their follow-up, the patients were classified into two groups as those developing and those not developing aGvHD. Nineteen healthy volunteers from a similar age group who needed their blood samples drawn for other reasons and who did not have any history of chronic disease, infection or medication use formed the control group. Blood samples of patients scheduled to have allogeneic HSCT were obtained before the administration of the preparative regimen, on Day +7 post-transplant and on the day of diagnosis if they developed aGvHD. Serum samples were stored at -20ºC until the day of processing. ST2 and Reg3α levels were measured using the ELISA method.
Results
For patients who developed aGvHD (n = 13), ST2 levels obtained before the transplantation, on Day +7 post-transplant and on the day of aGvHD diagnosis (in patients developing GvHD) were significantly higher compared to the healthy Control Group (p-value <0.05). As regards to the samples obtained on the same days, ST2 levels did not differ significantly among patients who developed and those who did not develop GvHD (n = 14; p-value >0.05). ST2 levels of samples obtained on the days that acute skin and gastrointestinal tract GvHD developed did not differ significantly between these two groups (p-value >0.05). Reg3α levels of the pre-transplant samples, on Day +7 after the transplantation and on the day of aGvHD diagnosis did not show any difference between any of the groups (p-value >0.05). As only two patients died after transplantation, thus correlation of ST2 and Reg3α levels with transplant-related mortality could not be proven.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that ST2 and Reg3α levels are neither diagnostic nor prognostic or predictive biomarkers of aGvHD, steroid resistance or transplant-related mortality in pediatric patients. This study can be regarded as a pilot study because of the small patient population; more research involving a larger patient population is required.

Abstract: Summary
The development of sustainable chemical processes is critical for society to supply commercial chemicals with limited natural resources. Here, we report catalytic reactions that are developed to upgrade lignocellulosic biomass into a pharmaceutical ingredient (rehmanone A) and monomers. Biomass-derived glucose is dissolved in an acetone/water co-solvent and used as a feed for sequential isomerization and dehydration to produce 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). This HMF is reacted with acetone to produce an aldol-condensed intermediate (HAH, adduct of two HMF and one acetone) in 94% isolation yield. The diol group in HAH is etherified with methanol to synthesize rehmanone A in 95% reaction yield. Alternatively, the C=C bonds in HAH are hydrogenated to produce monomers, such as partially hydrogenated HAH and fully hydrogenated HAH in 84% and 93% reaction yields, respectively. The experimental parameters are used to assess the economic potential of these synthesis-based processes by techno-economic analyses with a toll manufacturing scenario.

Abstract: Summary
Computed tomography (CT) images primarily provide tissue morphological information, while material composition analysis may enable a more fundamental body assessment. However, existing methods for this suffer from low accuracy and severe degradation. Furthermore, the complex composition of bodies and the absence of labels constrain the potential use of deep learning. Here, we present a self-supervised learning approach, generating multiple basis material images with no labels (NoL-MBMI), for analyzing material composition without labels. Results from phantom and patient experiments demonstrate that NoL-MBMI can provide results with superior visual quality and accuracy. Notably, to extend the clinical usage of NoL-MBMI, we construct an automated system to extract material composition information directly from standard single-energy CT (SECT) data for diagnosis. We evaluate the system on two pulmonary diagnosis tasks and observe that deep-learning models using material composition features significantly outperform those using morphological features, suggesting the clinical effectiveness of diagnosing utilizing material composition and its potential for advancing medical imaging technology.

Abstract: Summary
The use of deep eutectic solvent (DES)-based treatment is a potential solution for the effective disposal of heavy-metal-enriched biomass. However, energy-intensive recycling and inefficient reusability of DESs hinder industrialization of the process. Herein, instead of recycling DESs, we design a novel DES and develop a simultaneous process including biomass pretreatment and conversion of the obtained DES into an adhesive. The treatment successfully removes approximately 97% of Cd from the biomass, over 60% of lignin, and a small amount of polysaccharides. The inclusion of these components improves the adhesion of the DES, with the mechanism revealed by the molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, by incorporating a polymer network, the DES-based adhesive acquires superior adhesion strength and resistance to harsh environments. The techno-economic analysis reveals the competitive economic performance of this adhesive. These results offer a promising waste-free strategy for a synergetic utilization of heavy-metal-enriched plants.

Abstract: Summary
Traditional 60°C–85°C alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) systems suffer from high specific energy consumption (4.4–5.3 kWh Nm−3), which is yielded by poor performance and consumes parasitic energy to remove excessive heat. This study presents construction of a 20 kW endo-/exothermic ET-AWE system, oriented by elevated temperature (ET), that achieves a performance of 1.768 V@0.612 A cm−2 for 5.314 Nm3 h−1 hydrogen production while accomplishing ≥12 h thermoneutral operation. By trading off between system thermal and electrical energy requirements, a universal criterion to determine thermoneutral points yielding an optimal efficiency of 82.56%, and a decreased specific energy consumption of 4.293 kWh Nm−3 at 0.594 A cm−2 and 130°C is proposed. The capacity of ET-AWE systems to receive external heat from diversified thermal sources in endothermic mode is possible in this system. Flexible combined hydrogen and high-value heat supplies in exothermic mode allow for unique electric-hydrogen-heat coordination.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a prevalent hematological malignancy with high recurrence and no definitive cure. The current study revisits the role of the IGF1/IGF1R axis in MM, introducing a novel inhibitor, NT157. The IGF1/IGF1R pathway is pivotal in MM, influencing cell survival, proliferation, and migration and impacting patient survival outcomes. NT157 targets intracellular proteins such as IRS and STAT proteins and demonstrates antineoplastic potential in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In the present study, we assessed IGF1R signaling-related gene expression in MM patients and healthy donors, unveiling significant distinctions. MM cell lines displayed varying expression patterns of IGF1R-related proteins. A gene dependence analysis indicated the importance of targeting receptor and intracellular elements over autocrine IGF1. NT157 exhibited inhibitory effects on MM cell viability, clonal growth, cell cycle progression, and survival. Moreover, NT157 reduced IRS2 expression and STAT3, STAT5, and RPS6 activation and modulated oncogenes and tumor suppressors, fostering a tumor-suppressive molecular profile. In summary, our study demonstrates that the IGF1/IGF1R/IRS signaling axis is differentially activated in MM cells and the NT157’s capacity to modulate crucial molecular targets, promoting antiproliferative effects and apoptosis in MM cells. NT157 may offer a multifaceted approach to enhance MM therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Multi-band spectral filters that can transmit visible light but block UV and infrared light in the solar spectrum are applicable to energy-saving windows. However, such filters are usually designed to consider normal incident light only. Here, we report photonic structures allowing selective solar spectrum transmission in wide angles using a quantum-computing-enhanced active learning scheme, which includes machine learning, quantum annealing, and wave-optics simulation in an iterative loop. We experimentally demonstrate the optical characteristics of the photonic structure and its capability to reduce the temperature rise in an enclosure when combined with a thermal radiation layer (temperature reduction of 5.4°C–7.2°C and annual energy saving of ∼97.5 MJ/m2). This structure can be incorporated into existing windows in buildings or automobiles to reduce cooling energy consumption, and the active learning scheme can be applied to design materials with complex properties in general.

Abstract: The RAS isoforms (KRAS, HRAS and NRAS) have distinct cancer type-specific profiles. NRAS mutations are the second most prevalent RAS mutations in skin and hematological malignancies. Although RAS proteins were considered undruggable for decades, isoform and mutation-specific investigations have produced successful RAS inhibitors that are either specific to certain mutants, isoforms (pan-KRAS) or target all RAS proteins (pan-RAS). While extensive structural and biochemical investigations have focused mainly on K- and H-RAS mutations, NRAS mutations have received less attention, and the most prevalent NRAS mutations in human cancers, Q61K and Q61R, are rare in K- and H-RAS. This manuscript presents a crystal structure of the NRAS Q61K mutant in the GTP-bound form. Our structure reveals a previously unseen pocket near switch II induced by the binding of a ligand to the active form of the protein. This observation reveals a binding site that can potentially be exploited for development of inhibitors against mutant NRAS. Furthermore, the well-resolved catalytic site of this GTPase bound to native GTP provides insight into the stalled GTP hydrolysis observed for NRAS-Q61K.
