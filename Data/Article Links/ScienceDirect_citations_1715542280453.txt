Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cells promote neoplastic growth, in part by deregulating asymmetric cell division and enhancing self-renewal. To uncover mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in glioma stem cell (GSC) self-renewal, we performed a genetic suppressor screen for kinases to reverse the tumor phenotype of our Drosophila brain tumor model and identified dCdk5 as a critical regulator. CDK5, the human ortholog of dCdk5 (79% identity), is aberrantly activated in GBMs and tightly aligned with both chromosome 7 gains and stem cell markers affecting tumor-propagation. Our investigation revealed that pharmaceutical inhibition of CDK5 prevents GSC self-renewal in vitro and in xenografted tumors, at least partially by suppressing CREB1 activation independently of PKA/cAMP. Finally, our TCGA GBM data analysis revealed that CDK5, stem cell, and asymmetric cell division markers segregate within non-mesenchymal patient clusters, which may indicate preferential dependence on CDK5 signaling and sensitivity to its inhibition in this group.

Abstract: Summary
Hfq is an RNA chaperone and an important post-transcriptional regulator in bacteria. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), we show that Hfq associates with hundreds of different regions of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa chromosome. These associations are abolished when transcription is inhibited, indicating that they reflect Hfq binding to transcripts during their synthesis. Analogous ChIP-seq analyses with the post-transcriptional regulator Crc reveal that it associates with many of the same nascent transcripts as Hfq, an activity we show is Hfq dependent. Our findings indicate that Hfq binds many transcripts co-transcriptionally in P. aeruginosa, often in concert with Crc, and uncover direct regulatory targets of these proteins. They also highlight a general approach for studying the interactions of RNA-binding proteins with nascent transcripts in bacteria. The binding of post-transcriptional regulators to nascent mRNAs may represent a prevalent means of controlling translation in bacteria where transcription and translation are coupled.

Abstract: Summary
Optogenetic tools and imaging methods for recording and manipulating brain activity have boosted the field of neuroscience in unprecedented ways. However, behavioral paradigms for mice lag behind those of primates, limiting the full potential of such tools. Here, we present an innovative behavioral framework in which head-fixed mice directionally reach for water droplets, similar to the primate “center-out” reaching task. Mice rapidly engaged in the task, performed hundreds of trials, and reached in multiple directions when droplets were presented at different locations. Surprisingly, mice used chemosensation to determine the presence of water droplets. Optogenetic inactivation of the motor cortex halted the initiation and rapidly diverted the trajectory of ongoing movements. Layer 2/3 two-photon imaging revealed robust direction selectivity in most reach-related neurons. Finally, mice performed directional reaching instructed by vibratotactile stimuli, demonstrating the potential of this framework for studying, in addition to motor control, sensory processing, and decision making.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial learning requires estimates of location that may be obtained by path integration or from positional cues. Grid and other spatial firing patterns of neurons in the superficial medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) suggest roles in behavioral estimation of location. However, distinguishing the contributions of path integration and cue-based signals to spatial behaviors is challenging, and the roles of identified MEC neurons are unclear. We use virtual reality to dissociate linear path integration from other strategies for behavioral estimation of location. We find that mice learn to path integrate using motor-related self-motion signals, with accuracy that decreases steeply as a function of distance. We show that inactivation of stellate cells in superficial MEC impairs spatial learning in virtual reality and in a real world object location recognition task. Our results quantify contributions of path integration to behavior and corroborate key predictions of models in which stellate cells contribute to location estimation.

Increased Amino Acid Uptake Supports Autophagy-Deficient Cell Survival upon Glutamine Deprivation,

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a protein degradation process by which intracellular materials are recycled for energy homeostasis. However, the metabolic status and energy source of autophagy-defective tumor cells are poorly understood. Here, our data show that amino acid uptake from the extracellular environment is increased in autophagy-deficient cells upon glutamine deprivation. This elevated amino acid uptake results from activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-dependent upregulation of AAT (amino acid transporter) gene expression. Furthermore, we identify SIRT6, a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, as a corepressor of ATF4 transcriptional activity. In autophagy-deficient cells, activated NRF2 enhances ATF4 transcriptional activity by disrupting the interaction between SIRT6 and ATF4. In this way, autophagy-deficient cells exhibit increased AAT expression and show increased amino acid uptake. Notably, inhibition of amino acid uptake reduces the viability of glutamine-deprived autophagy-deficient cells, but not significantly in wild-type cells, suggesting reliance of autophagy-deficient tumor cells on extracellular amino acid uptake.

Abstract: Summary
Extensive spontaneous DNA damage from oncogene-induced replication stress is ubiquitous in precancerous lesions. While this damage induces differentiation, senescence, or apoptosis in normal cells, defects in DNA replication stress response (RSR) allow cells to continue proliferating, ultimately leading to early tumorigenesis. Using systems-level approaches, we developed a replication stress response defect gene signature that predicted risk of cancer development from hyperplastic lesions. Intriguingly, we found that replication stress response defects rewire non-malignant cells into a cancer stem cell (CSC)-like state, and analysis of CSCs indicated that they inherently harbor replication stress response defects. High-throughput drug screening to elucidate molecules required for survival of replication stress response defective cells identified a dependence on MEK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of this signaling cascade restored oncogene-induced senescence through a p53-independent MDM2/p21 axis. Moreover, MEK/ERK inhibition also depleted CSC populations. Together, these findings provide insights into the role of replication stress response defects in CSCs and an actionable pathway for therapeutic targeting.

Abstract: Summary
Assays that can characterize MSC immune potency need to be identified for use in advanced clinical trials. MSCs possess a number of putative regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, and an assay matrix approach may best capture involved effector pathways. We have tested two assay systems to measure the potency of MSCs derived from human subjects: MSC secretome analysis and a quantitative RNA-based array for genes specific to immunomodulatory and homing properties of MSCs. Secretome analysis identified a unique cytokine signature that is upregulated by MSCs or downregulated in responder PBMCs and correlated with T cell suppression. Use of interferon-γ as a surrogate for the action of activated PBMCs on MSCs served as an alternative for the use of human PBMCs as responder cells in a potency assay. Our approach and results define and simplify the multifunctional or matrix responses of MSCs and may serve as a platform for robust potency analysis.

Abstract: Hypoxic culture is widely recognized as a method to efficiently expand human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) without loss of stem cell properties. However, the molecular basis of how hypoxia priming benefits MSC expansion remains unclear. In this report, our systemic quantitative proteomic and RT-PCR analyses revealed the involvement of hypoxic conditioning activated genes in the signaling process of the mitotic cell cycle. Introduction of screened two mitotic cyclins, CCNA2 and CCNB1, significantly extended the proliferation lifespan of MSCs in normoxic condition. Our results provide important molecular evidence that multipotency of human MSCs by hypoxic conditioning is determined by the mitotic cell cycle duration. Thus, the activation of mitotic cyclins could be a potential strategy to the application of stem cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Circadian rhythms regulate cell proliferation and differentiation; however, little is known about their roles in myogenic differentiation. Our synchronized differentiation studies demonstrate that myoblast proliferation and subsequent myotube formation by cell fusion occur in circadian manners. We found that one of the core regulators of circadian rhythms, Cry2, but not Cry1, is critical for the circadian patterns of these two critical steps in myogenic differentiation. This is achieved through the specific interaction between Cry2 and Bclaf1, which stabilizes mRNAs encoding cyclin D1, a G1/S phase transition regulator, and Tmem176b, a transmembrane regulator for myogenic cell fusion. Myoblasts lacking Cry2 display premature cell cycle exit and form short myotubes because of inefficient cell fusion. Consistently, muscle regeneration is impaired in Cry2−/− mice. Bclaf1 knockdown recapitulated the phenotypes of Cry2 knockdown: early cell cycle exit and inefficient cell fusion. This study uncovers a post-transcriptional regulation of myogenic differentiation by circadian rhythms.

Abstract: Summary
Under stress, certain eukaryotic proteins and RNA assemble to form membraneless organelles known as stress granules. The most well-studied stress granule components are RNA-binding proteins that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) into protein-rich droplets mediated by intrinsically disordered low-complexity domains (LCDs). Here we show that stress granules include proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN2, an LCD-containing protein structurally and functionally distinct from RNA-binding proteins. In vitro, UBQLN2 exhibits LLPS at physiological conditions. Deletion studies correlate oligomerization with UBQLN2’s ability to phase-separate and form stress-induced cytoplasmic puncta in cells. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we mapped weak, multivalent interactions that promote UBQLN2 oligomerization and LLPS. Ubiquitin or polyubiquitin binding, obligatory for UBQLN2’s biological functions, eliminates UBQLN2 LLPS, thus serving as a switch between droplet and disperse phases. We postulate that UBQLN2 LLPS enables its recruitment to stress granules, where its interactions with ubiquitinated substrates reverse LLPS to enable shuttling of clients out of stress granules.

Abstract: All three members of the Orai family of cation channels–Orai1, Orai2 and Orai3–are integral membrane proteins that can form store-operated Ca2+ channels resembling endogenous calcium release-activated channels (CRAC) in many aspects. Loss of function studies in human and murine models revealed many functions of Orai1 proteins not only for Ca2+ homeostasis, but also for cellular and systemic functions in many cell types. By contrast, the knowledge regarding the contribution of Orai2 and Orai3 proteins in these processes is sparse. In this study, we report the generation of mouse models with targeted inactivation of the Orai2 gene to study Orai2 function in peritoneal mast cells (PMC), a classical cell model for CRAC channels and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of inflammatory mediators. We show that the Ca2+ rise triggered by agonists acting on high-affinity Fc receptors for IgE or on MAS-related G protein-coupled receptors is significantly increased in Orai2-deficient mast cells. Ca2+ entry triggered by depletion of intracellular stores (SOCE) is also increased in Orai2−/− PMCs at high (2mM) extracellular Ca2+ concentration, whereas SOCE is largely reduced upon re-addtion of lower (0.1mM) Ca2+ concentration. Likewise, the density of CRAC currents, Ca2+-dependent mast cell degranulation, and mast cell-mediated anaphylaxis are intensified in Orai2-deficient mice. These results show that the presence of Orai2 proteins limits receptor-evoked Ca2+ transients, store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) as well as degranulation of murine peritoneal mast cells but also raise the idea that Orai2 proteins contribute to Ca2+ entry in connective tissue type mast cells in discrete operation modes depending on the availability of calcium ions in the extracellular space.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can drive inflammation, cell survival, and death. While ubiquitylation-, phosphorylation-, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent checkpoints suppress the cytotoxic potential of TNF, it remains unclear whether ubiquitylation can directly repress TNF-induced death. Here, we show that ubiquitylation regulates RIPK1’s cytotoxic potential not only via activation of downstream kinases and NF-kB transcriptional responses, but also by directly repressing RIPK1 kinase activity via ubiquitin-dependent inactivation. We find that the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP)1 is required for optimal ubiquitin-lysine occupancy and K48 ubiquitylation of RIPK1. Independently of IKK and MK2, cIAP1-mediated and UBA-assisted ubiquitylation suppresses RIPK1 kinase auto-activation and, in addition, marks it for proteasomal degradation. In the absence of a functional UBA domain of cIAP1, more active RIPK1 kinase accumulates in response to TNF, causing RIPK1 kinase-mediated cell death and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. These results reveal a direct role for cIAP-mediated ubiquitylation in controlling RIPK1 kinase activity and preventing TNF-mediated cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Background
The cardiovascular system is a primary target of stress and stress is the most important etiologic factor in cardiovascular diseases. Stressors increase expressions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and apelin in cardiac tissue.
Aim
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether stress-induced apelin has an effect on the expression of ANP in the right atrium of rat heart.
Methods
The rats were divided into the control, stress and F13A+stress groups. In the stress and F13A+stress groups, the rats were subjected to water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS) for 6h. In the F13A+stress group, apelin receptor antagonist F13A, was injected intravenously immediately before application of WIRS. The plasma samples were obtained for the measurement of corticosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide. The atrial samples were used for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.
Results
F13A administration prevented the rise of plasma corticosterone and ANP levels induced by WIRS. While WIRS application increased the expressions of apelin, HIF-1α and ANP in atrial tissue, while F13A prevented the stress-induced increase in the expression of HIF-1α and ANP.
Conclusion
Stress-induced apelin induces ANP expression in atrial tissue and may play a role in cardiovascular homeostasis by increasing ANP expression under WIRS conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolism is a fundamental process of life. However, non-invasive measurement of local tissue metabolism is limited today by a deficiency in adequate tools for in vivo observations. We designed a multi-modular platform that explored the relation between local tissue oxygen consumption, determined by label-free optoacoustic measurements of hemoglobin, and concurrent indirect calorimetry obtained during metabolic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). By studying mice and humans, we show how video-rate handheld multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) in the 700–970 nm spectral range enables non-invasive imaging of BAT activation, consistent with positron emission tomography findings. Moreover, we observe BAT composition differences between healthy and diabetic tissues. The study consolidates hemoglobin as a principal label-free biomarker for longitudinal non-invasive imaging of BAT morphology and bioenergetics in situ. We also resolve water and fat components in volunteers, and contrast MSOT readouts with magnetic resonance imaging data.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex network of sheets and tubules that is continuously remodeled. The relevance of this membrane dynamics is underscored by the fact that mutations in atlastins (ATLs), the ER fusion proteins in mammals, cause neurodegeneration. How defects in this process disrupt neuronal homeostasis is unclear. Using electron microscopy (EM) volume reconstruction of transfected cells, neurons, and patient fibroblasts, we show that hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN)-causing ATL3 mutants promote aberrant ER tethering hallmarked by bundles of laterally attached ER tubules. In vitro, these mutants cause excessive liposome tethering, recapitulating the results in cells. Moreover, ATL3 variants retain their dimerization-dependent GTPase activity but are unable to promote membrane fusion, suggesting a defect in an intermediate step of the ATL3 functional cycle. Our data show that the effects of ATL3 mutations on ER network organization go beyond a loss of fusion and shed light on neuropathies caused by atlastin defects.

Abstract: Background
Despite significant achievements in the field of tissue engineering, simplification and improvement of the existing protocols are of great importance. The use of complex differentiation media, due to the presence of multiple factors, may have some undesired effects on cell health and functions. Thus, minimizing the number of involved factors, while maintaining the differentiation efficiency, provides less costly and controllable conditions. Adipose-derived Mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), the adult stem cells present in adipose tissue, can be a suitable source of stem cells due to abundant and ease of access. The aim of this study is to optimize the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs by chemical composition of scaffold, in the first step, and then by electromagnetic treatments.
Methods
ASCs were cultured on PVA/PES scaffold and tissue culture polystyrene surfaces (TCPS) and osteogenic differentiation was performed with either osteogenic medium, or electromagnetic field or both. The impact of each treatment on ASCs growth and proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Changes in gene expression levels of osteogenic-specific markers including ALP and RUNX2 were determined by Real Time PCR. Furthermore, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition were measured.
Results
The MTT assay showed the significant effects on cell growth and respiration in scaffold-seeded ASCs treated with electromagnetic field, compared to control TCPS plate. Also, the electromagnetic treatment, increased alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. Finally, Real Time PCR showed higher expression of ALP and RUNX2 genes in electromagnetic field groups compared to control groups.
Conclusion
It can be concluded that PVA/PES scaffold used in this study improved the osteogenic capacity of ASCs. Moreover, the osteogenic potential of ASCs seeded on PVA/PES scaffold could be augmented by electromagnetic field without any chemical stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
A major obstacle for successful management of patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is resistance to anti-cancer cytotoxic treatments. Here, we identified a mechanism of multidrug resistance in wild-type Kras CRCs based on the survival of a cell subpopulation characterized by Sirt5 expression. Sirt5+ cells in wild-type Kras CRCs are resistant to either chemotherapeutic agents or cetuximab and serve as a reservoir for recurrence. Sirt5 demalonylates and inactivates succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA), leading to an accumulation of the oncometabolite succinate. Succinate binds to and activates a reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme, thioredoxin reductase 2 (TrxR2), to confer chemotherapy resistance. In contrast, Sirt5+ cells exhibit an elevated succinate-to-aKG ratio that inhibits aKG-dependent dioxygenases to maintain cetuximab resistance. Our findings suggest that Sirt5 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and/or cetuximab may represent a therapeutic strategy for CRC patients harboring wild-type Kras.

Abstract: Summary
We assessed the subsistence-related variation of the human gut microbiome at a fine resolution for two of the main dimensions of microbiome variation, age and geography. For this, we investigated the fecal microbiome and metabolome in rural Bassa and urbanized individuals from Nigeria, including infants, and compared data with worldwide populations practicing varying subsistence. Our data highlight specific microbiome traits that are progressively lost with urbanization, such as the dominance of pristine fiber degraders and the low inter-individual variation. For the Bassa, this last feature is the result of their subsistence-related practices favoring microbial dispersal, such as their extensive environmental contact and the usage of untreated waters from the Usuma River. The high degree of microbial dispersal observed in the Bassa meta-community nullifies the differences between infant and adult intestinal ecosystems, suggesting that the infant-type microbiome in Western populations could be the result of microbiome-associated neotenic traits favored by urbanization.

Abstract: The purinergic transduction was examined in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from the human adipose tissue, and several nucleotides, including ATP, UTP, and ADP, were found to mobilize cytosolic Ca2+. Transcripts for multiple purinoreceptors were detected in MSC preparations, including A1, A2A, A2B, P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y13, P2Y14, P2X2, P2X4, and P2X7. Cellular responses to nucleotides were insignificantly sensitive to bath Ca2+, pointing at a minor contribution of Ca2+ entry, and were suppressed by U73122 and 2-APB, implicating the phosphoinositide cascade in coupling P2Y receptors to Ca2+ release. While individual cells were sensitive to several P2Y agonists, responsiveness to a given nucleotide varied from cell to cell, suggesting that particular MSCs could employ different sets of purinoreceptors. Caged Ca2+ stimulated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that was mediated largely by IP3 receptors, and resultant Ca2+ transients were similar to nucleotide responses by magnitude and kinetics. A variety of findings hinted at CICR to be a universal mechanism that finalizes Ca2+ signaling initiated by agonists in MSCs. Individual MSCs responded to nucleotides in an all-or-nothing manner. Presumably just CICR provided invariant Ca2+ responses observed in MSCs at different nucleotide concentrations. The effects of isoform specific agonists and antagonists suggested that both P2Y1 and P2Y13 were obligatory for ADP responses, while P2Y4 and P2Y11 served as primary UTP and ATP receptors, respectively. Extracellular NAD+ stimulated Ca2+ signaling in each ATP-responsive MSC by involving P2Y11. The overall data indicate that extracellular nucleotides and NAD+ can serve as autocrine/paracrine factors regulating MSC functions.

Abstract: Summary
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is the most commonly mutated gene in grade II–III glioma and secondary glioblastoma (GBM). A causal role for IDH1R132H in gliomagenesis has been proposed, but functional validation in vivo has not been demonstrated. In this study, we assessed the role of IDH1R132H in glioma development in the context of clinically relevant cooperating genetic alterations in vitro and in vivo. Immortal astrocytes expressing IDH1R132H exhibited elevated (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate levels, reduced NADPH, increased proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth. Although not sufficient on its own, IDH1R132H cooperated with PDGFA and loss of Cdkn2a, Atrx, and Pten to promote glioma development in vivo. These tumors resembled proneural human mutant IDH1 GBM genetically, histologically, and functionally. Our findings support the hypothesis that IDH1R132H promotes glioma development. This model enhances our understanding of the biology of IDH1R132H-driven gliomas and facilitates testing of therapeutic strategies designed to combat this deadly disease.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in patterning during human embryonic development frequently result in craniofacial abnormalities. The gene regulatory programs that build the craniofacial complex are likely controlled by information located between genes and within intronic sequences. However, systematic identification of regulatory sequences important for forming the human face has not been performed. Here, we describe comprehensive epigenomic annotations from human embryonic craniofacial tissues and systematic comparisons with multiple tissues and cell types. We identified thousands of tissue-specific craniofacial regulatory sequences and likely causal regions for rare craniofacial abnormalities. We demonstrate significant enrichment of common variants associated with orofacial clefting in enhancers active early in embryonic development, while those associated with normal facial variation are enriched near the end of the embryonic period. These data are provided in easily accessible formats for both craniofacial researchers and clinicians to aid future experimental design and interpretation of noncoding variation in those affected by craniofacial abnormalities.

Abstract: Summary
Visual neurons that track objects on a collision course are often finely tuned to their target stimuli because this is critical for survival. The presynaptic neural networks converging on these neurons and their role in tuning them remain poorly understood. We took advantage of well-known characteristics of one such neuron in the grasshopper visual system to investigate the properties of its presynaptic input network. We find the structure more complex than hitherto realized. In addition to dynamic lateral inhibition used to filter out background motion, presynaptic circuits include normalizing inhibition and excitatory interactions mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These interactions preferentially boost responses to coherently expanding visual stimuli generated by colliding objects, as opposed to spatially incoherent controls, helping to discriminate between them. Hence, in addition to active dendritic conductances within collision-detecting neurons, multiple layers of inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic connections are needed to finely tune neural circuits for collision detection.

Abstract: Summary
Canonical Wnt signaling coordinates many critical aspects of embryonic development, while dysregulated Wnt signaling contributes to common diseases, including congenital malformations and cancer. The nuclear localization of β-catenin is the defining step in pathway activation. However, despite intensive investigation, the mechanisms regulating β-catenin nuclear transport remain undefined. In a patient with congenital heart disease and heterotaxy, a disorder of left-right patterning, we previously identified the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RAPGEF5. Here, we demonstrate that RAPGEF5 regulates left-right patterning via Wnt signaling. In particular, RAPGEF5 regulates the nuclear translocation of β-catenin independently of both β-catenin cytoplasmic stabilization and the importin β1/Ran-mediated transport system. We propose a model whereby RAPGEF5 activates the nuclear GTPases, Rap1a/b, to facilitate the nuclear transport of β-catenin, defining a parallel nuclear transport pathway to Ran. Our results suggest new targets for modulating Wnt signaling in disease states.

Abstract: Summary
As most of the mitochondrial proteome is encoded in the nucleus, mitochondrial functions critically depend on nuclear gene expression and bidirectional mito-nuclear communication. However, mitochondria-to-nucleus communication pathways in mammals are incompletely understood. Here, we identify G-Protein Pathway Suppressor 2 (GPS2) as a mediator of mitochondrial retrograde signaling and a transcriptional activator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. GPS2-regulated translocation from mitochondria to nucleus is essential for the transcriptional activation of a nuclear stress response to mitochondrial depolarization and for supporting basal mitochondrial biogenesis in differentiating adipocytes and brown adipose tissue (BAT) from mice. In the nucleus, GPS2 recruitment to target gene promoters regulates histone H3K9 demethylation and RNA POL2 activation through inhibition of Ubc13-mediated ubiquitination. These findings, together, reveal an additional layer of regulation of mitochondrial gene transcription, uncover a direct mitochondria-nuclear communication pathway, and indicate that GPS2 retrograde signaling is a key component of the mitochondrial stress response in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
The targeting efficiency of knockin sequences via homologous recombination (HR) is generally low. Here we describe a method we call Tild-CRISPR (targeted integration with linearized dsDNA-CRISPR), a targeting strategy in which a PCR-amplified or precisely enzyme-cut transgene donor with 800-bp homology arms is injected with Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA into mouse zygotes. Compared with existing targeting strategies, this method achieved much higher knockin efficiency in mouse embryos, as well as brain tissue. Importantly, the Tild-CRISPR method also yielded up to 12-fold higher knockin efficiency than HR-based methods in human embryos, making it suitable for studying gene functions in vivo and developing potential gene therapies.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to induce the production of isthmic organizer (IsO)-like cells capable of secreting fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 8 and WNT1 from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The precise modulation of canonical Wnt signaling was achieved in the presence of the small molecule CHIR99021 (0.6 μM) during the neural induction of human ESCs, resulting in the differentiation of these cells into IsO-like cells having a midbrain-hindbrain border (MHB) fate in a manner that recapitulated their developmental course in vivo. Resultant cells showed upregulated expression levels of FGF8 and WNT1. The addition of exogenous FGF8 further increased WNT1 expression by 2.6 fold. Gene ontology following microarray analysis confirmed that IsO-like cells enriched the expression of MHB-related genes by 40 fold compared to control cells. Lysates and conditioned media of IsO-like cells contained functional FGF8 and WNT1 proteins that could induce MHB-related genes in differentiating ESCs. The method for generating functional IsO-like cells described in this study could be used to study human central nervous system development and congenital malformations of the midbrain and hindbrain.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factor programming of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has emerged as an approach to generate human neurons for disease modeling. However, programming schemes produce a variety of cell types, and those neurons that are made often retain an immature phenotype, which limits their utility in modeling neuronal processes, including synaptic transmission. We report that combining NGN2 programming with SMAD and WNT inhibition generates human patterned induced neurons (hpiNs). Single-cell analyses showed that hpiN cultures contained cells along a developmental continuum, ranging from poorly differentiated neuronal progenitors to well-differentiated, excitatory glutamatergic neurons. The most differentiated neurons could be identified using a CAMK2A::GFP reporter gene and exhibited greater functionality, including NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission. We conclude that utilizing single-cell and reporter gene approaches for selecting successfully programmed cells for study will greatly enhance the utility of hpiNs and other programmed neuronal populations in the modeling of nervous system disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Normal brain functions depend on the balanced development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibitory synapse formation is limited. Neuroligin-2 (NL2), a transmembrane protein at inhibitory postsynaptic sites, is capable of initiating inhibitory synapse formation. In an effort to search for NL2 binding proteins and the downstream mechanisms responsible for inhibitory synapse development, we identify LHFPL4/GARLH4 as a major NL2 binding partner that is specifically enriched at inhibitory postsynaptic sites. LHFPL4/GARLH4 and NL2 regulate the protein levels and synaptic clustering of each other in the cerebellum. Lhfpl4/Garlh4−/− mice display profound impairment of inhibitory synapse formation as well as prominent motor behavioral deficits and premature death. Our findings highlight the essential role of LHFPL4/GARLH4 in brain functions by regulating inhibitory synapse formation as a major NL2 binding partner.

Abstract: Summary
Yin yang 1 (YY1) is a ubiquitous transcription factor and mammalian polycomb group protein (PcG) with important functions to regulate embryonic development, lineage differentiation, and cell proliferation. YY1 mediates stable PcG-dependent transcriptional repression via recruitment of PcG proteins that catalyze histone modifications. Many questions remain unanswered regarding how cell- and tissue-specificity is achieved by PcG proteins. Here, we demonstrate that a conditional knockout of Yy1 in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) decreases long-term repopulating activity and ectopic YY1 expression expands HSCs. Although the YY1 PcG domain is required for Igκ chain rearrangement in B cells, the YY1 mutant lacking the PcG domain retained the capacity to stimulate HSC self-renewal. YY1 deficiency deregulated the genetic network governing HSC cell proliferation and impaired stem cell factor/c-Kit signaling, disrupting mechanisms conferring HSC quiescence. These results reveal a mechanism for how a ubiquitously expressed transcriptional repressor mediates lineage-specific functions to control adult hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-MY) are pacemakers that generate and propagate electrical slow waves in gastrointestinal (GI) muscles. Slow waves appear to be generated by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activation of Ca2+-activated Cl− channels (Ano1). Conduction of slow waves to smooth muscle cells coordinates rhythmic contractions. Mitochondrial Ca2+ handling is currently thought to be critical for ICC pacemaking. Protonophores, inhibitors of the electron transport chain (FCCP, CCCP or antimycin) or mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange blockers inhibited slow waves in several GI muscles. Here we utilized Ca2+ imaging of ICC in small intestinal muscles in situ to determine the effects of mitochondrial drugs on Ca2+ transients in ICC. Muscles were obtained from mice expressing a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP3) in ICC. FCCP, CCCP, antimycin, a uniporter blocker, Ru360, and a mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor, CGP-37157 inhibited Ca2+ transients in ICC-MY. Effects were not due to depletion of ATP, as oligomycin did not affect Ca2+ transients. Patch-clamp experiments were performed to test the effects of the mitochondrial drugs on key pacemaker conductances, Ano1 and T-type Ca2+ (CaV3.2), in HEK293 cells. Antimycin blocked Ano1 and reduced CaV3.2 currents. CCCP blocked CaV3.2 current but did not affect Ano1 current. Ano1 and Cav3.2 currents were inhibited by CGP-37157. Inhibitory effects of mitochondrial drugs on slow waves and Ca2+ signalling in ICC can be explained by direct antagonism of key pacemaker conductances in ICC that generate and propagate slow waves. A direct obligatory role for mitochondria in pacemaker activity is therefore questionable.

Abstract: Summary
How are closely related lineages, including liver, pancreas, and intestines, diversified from a common endodermal origin? Here, we apply principles learned from developmental biology to rapidly reconstitute liver progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Mapping the formation of multiple endodermal lineages revealed how alternate endodermal fates (e.g., pancreas and intestines) are restricted during liver commitment. Human liver fate was encoded by combinations of inductive and repressive extracellular signals at different doses. However, these signaling combinations were temporally re-interpreted: cellular competence to respond to retinoid, WNT, TGF-β, and other signals sharply changed within 24 hr. Consequently, temporally dynamic manipulation of extracellular signals was imperative to suppress the production of unwanted cell fates across six consecutive developmental junctures. This efficiently generated 94.1% ± 7.35% TBX3+HNF4A+ human liver bud progenitors and 81.5% ± 3.2% FAH+ hepatocyte-like cells by days 6 and 18 of hPSC differentiation, respectively; the latter improved short-term survival in the Fah−/−Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− mouse model of liver failure.

Abstract: The Chinese alligator Alligator sinensis is an endangered freshwater crocodilian species endemic to China. Hematology and serum biochemistry reference range are useful in the assessment and management of animal health condition. In this study, a total of 74 Chinese Alligators (30 males and 44 females) were examined to establish reference range values of hematology and serum biochemistry parameters during the active and hibernating periods. We measured and analyzed 9 hematology and 21 serum biochemistry parameters including 4 serum electrolyte parameters, and described the morphology of different types of blood cells. No statistical differences between the sexes were found for hematology parameter, while significant differences were noted for some serum biochemistry parameters, with males having greater alkaline phosphatase activity level and lower globulin concentration value than females. There were some significant differences between the two different periods with alligators during the active period possessing lower values for mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, total bilirubin and creatine kinase, but higher values for red blood cell and white blood cell counts, monocyte percentage, aspartate aminotransferase, a-amylase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, triglycerides, and cholesterol. These baseline data were essential for health condition evaluation and disease diagnosis of this endangered species.

Abstract: The present study was designed to determine the distribution, morphology and co-localization of calbindin-D28k (CB) with other neuroactive substances in the coeliac-cranial mesenteric ganglion complex (CCMG) neurons supplying the prepyloric region of the porcine stomach. In all animals, a median laparotomy was performed and the fluorescent retrograde neuronal tracer Fast Blue was injected into the wall of the stomach prepyloric area. On the 28th day, all animals were euthanized and the CCMG complexes were then collected and processed for double-labelling immunofluorescence for CB and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), galanin (GAL), somatostatin (SOM), leu 5-enkephalin (LENK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P (SP) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CART), Immunohistochemistry revealed that 8.27±0.51% of FB-positive neurons expressed CB-like immunoreactivity. Furthermore, CB co-localized with TH, GAL and SOM in retrogradely labelled cell bodies, whereas CART, LENK, VIP and SP were detected only in nerve terminals surrounding FB+/CB+ neurons. The presence of CB in the stomach-projecting neurons may indicate the contribution of CB in the sympathetic regulation of the stomach function. Furthermore, CB-LI neurons had a catecholaminergic character and co-localized with TH, GAL and SOM, which suggests multiple functions of this neuroactive substance in the CCMG neurons supplying the porcine prepyloric area.

Abstract: Summary
Class switch recombination (CSR) at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus is associated with the formation of R-loop structures over switch (S) regions. While these often occur co-transcriptionally between nascent RNA and template DNA, we now show that they also form as part of a post-transcriptional mechanism targeting AID to IgH S-regions. This depends on the RNA helicase DDX1 that is also required for CSR in vivo. DDX1 binds to G-quadruplex (G4) structures present in intronic switch transcripts and converts them into S-region R-loops. This in turn targets the cytidine deaminase enzyme AID to S-regions so promoting CSR. Notably R-loop levels over S-regions are diminished by chemical stabilization of G4 RNA or by the expression of a DDX1 ATPase-deficient mutant that acts as a dominant-negative protein to reduce CSR efficiency. In effect, we provide evidence for how S-region transcripts interconvert between G4 and R-loop structures to promote CSR in the IgH locus.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA-223 is known as a myeloid-enriched anti-inflammatory microRNA that is dysregulated in numerous inflammatory conditions. Here, we report that neutrophilic inflammation (wound response) is augmented in miR-223-deficient zebrafish, due primarily to elevated activation of the canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. NF-κB over-activation is restricted to the basal layer of the surface epithelium, although miR-223 is detected throughout the epithelium and in phagocytes. Not only phagocytes but also epithelial cells are involved in miR-223-mediated regulation of neutrophils’ wound response and NF-κB activation. Cul1a/b, Traf6, and Tab1 are identified as direct targets of miR-223, and their levels rise in injured epithelium lacking miR-223. In addition, miR-223 is expressed in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells, where it also downregulates NF-κB signaling. Together, this direct connection between miR-223 and the canonical NF-κB pathway provides a mechanistic understanding of the multifaceted role of miR-223 and highlights the relevance of epithelial cells in dampening neutrophil activation.

Abstract: Summary
Intermittent fasting (IF) improves cardiometabolic health; however, it is unknown whether these effects are due solely to weight loss. We conducted the first supervised controlled feeding trial to test whether IF has benefits independent of weight loss by feeding participants enough food to maintain their weight. Our proof-of-concept study also constitutes the first trial of early time-restricted feeding (eTRF), a form of IF that involves eating early in the day to be in alignment with circadian rhythms in metabolism. Men with prediabetes were randomized to eTRF (6-hr feeding period, with dinner before 3 p.m.) or a control schedule (12-hr feeding period) for 5 weeks and later crossed over to the other schedule. eTRF improved insulin sensitivity, β cell responsiveness, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and appetite. We demonstrate for the first time in humans that eTRF improves some aspects of cardiometabolic health and that IF’s effects are not solely due to weight loss.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical in regulating the immune response. In vitro induced Treg (iTreg) cells have significant potential in clinical medicine. However, applying iTreg cells as therapeutics is complicated by the poor stability of human iTreg cells and their variable suppressive activity. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of human iTreg cell specification. We identified hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) as a transcription factor upregulated early during the differentiation of human iTreg cells. Although FOXP3 expression was unaffected, HIC1 deficiency led to a considerable loss of suppression by iTreg cells with a concomitant increase in the expression of effector T cell associated genes. SNPs linked to several immune-mediated disorders were enriched around HIC1 binding sites, and in vitro binding assays indicated that these SNPs may alter the binding of HIC1. Our results suggest that HIC1 is an important contributor to iTreg cell development and function.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of LKB1 is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in lung cancer, but the development of targeted agents is in its infancy. Here we report that a glutaminolytic enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1), upregulated upon detachment via pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1), provides anti-anoikis and pro-metastatic signals in LKB1-deficient lung cancer. Mechanistically, the GDH1 product α-KG activates CamKK2 by enhancing its substrate AMPK binding, which contributes to energy production that confers anoikis resistance. The effect of GDH1 on AMPK is evident in LKB1-deficient lung cancer, where AMPK activation predominantly depends on CamKK2. Targeting GDH1 with R162 attenuated tumor metastasis in patient-derived xenograft model and correlation studies in lung cancer patients further validated the clinical relevance of our finding. Our study provides insight into the molecular mechanism by which GDH1-mediated metabolic reprogramming of glutaminolysis mediates lung cancer metastasis and offers a therapeutic strategy for patients with LKB1-deficient lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Correlated activity in the hippocampus drives synaptic plasticity that is necessary for the recruitment of neuronal ensembles underlying fear memory. Sustained neural activity, on the other hand, may trigger homeostatic adaptations. However, whether homeostatic plasticity affects memory function remains unknown. Here, we use optogenetics to induce cell autonomous homeostatic plasticity in CA1 pyramidal neurons and granule cells of the hippocampus. High-frequency spike trains applied for 10 min decreased the number of excitatory spine synapses and increased the number of inhibitory shaft synapses. This activity stopped dendritic spine formation via L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel activity and protein synthesis. Applied selectively to the ensemble of granule cells encoding a contextual fear memory, the spike trains impaired memory recall and facilitated extinction. Our results indicate that homeostatic plasticity triggered by optogenetic neuronal firing alters the balance between excitation and inhibition in favor of memory extinction.

Abstract: Triglyceride homeostasis is a key process of normal development and is essential for the maintenance of energy metabolism. Dysregulation of this process leads to metabolic disorders such as obesity and hyperlipidemia. Here, we report a novel function of the Drosophila flightless-I (fliI) gene in lipid metabolism. Drosophila fliI mutants were resistant to starvation and showed increased levels of triglycerides in the fat body and intestine, whereas fliI overexpression decreased triglyceride levels. These flies suffered from metabolic stress indicated by increased levels of trehalose in hemolymph and enhanced phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Moreover, upregulation of triglycerides via a knockdown of fliI was reversed by a knockdown of desat1 in the fat body of flies. These results indicate that fliI suppresses the expression of desat1, thereby inhibiting the development of obesity; fliI may, thus, serve as a novel therapeutic target in obesity and metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inhibit anti-tumor immunity. Aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer. However, the link between MDSCs and glycolysis is unknown in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we detect abundant glycolytic activities in human TNBC. In two TNBC mouse models, 4T1 and Py8119, glycolysis restriction inhibits tumor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression and reduces MDSCs. These are accompanied with enhanced T cell immunity, reduced tumor growth and metastasis, and prolonged mouse survival. Mechanistically, glycolysis restriction represses the expression of a specific CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB) isoform, liver-enriched activator protein (LAP), via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-ULK1 and autophagy pathways, whereas LAP controls G-CSF and GM-CSF expression to support MDSC development. Glycolytic signatures that include lactate dehydrogenase A correlate with high MDSCs and low T cells, and are associated with poor human TNBC outcome. Collectively, tumor glycolysis orchestrates a molecular network of the AMPK-ULK1, autophagy, and CEBPB pathways to affect MDSCs and maintain tumor immunosuppression.

Abstract: Aortic dissection (AD) is a catastrophic disease with high mortality and morbidity, characterized with fragmentation of elastin and loss of smooth muscle cells. Although AD has been largely attributable to polymorphisms defect in the elastin-coding gene, tropoelastin (TE), other undermined factors also appear to play roles in AD onset. Here, we investigated the effects of post-transcriptional control of TE by microRNAs (miRNAs) on elastin levels in aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC). We found that miR-144-3p is a miRNA that targets TE mRNA in both human and mouse. Bioinformatics analyses and dual luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-144-3p inhibited protein translation of TE, through binding to the 3′-UTR of the TE mRNA. Interestingly, higher miR-144-3p levels and lower TE were detected in the ASMC obtained from AD patients, compared to those from non-AD controls. In a mouse model for human AD, infusion of adeno-associated viruses (serotype 6) carrying antisense for miR-144-3p (as-miR-144-3p) under CAG promoter significantly reduced the incidence and severity of AD, seemingly through enhancement of TE levels in ASMC. Thus, our data suggest an essential role of miR-144-3p on the pathogenesis of AD.

Abstract: Summary
The conserved RNA-binding protein ProQ has emerged as the centerpiece of a previously unknown third large network of post-transcriptional control in enterobacteria. Here, we have used in vivo UV crosslinking and RNA sequencing (CLIP-seq) to map hundreds of ProQ binding sites in Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli. Our analysis of these binding sites, many of which are conserved, suggests that ProQ recognizes its cellular targets through RNA structural motifs found in small RNAs (sRNAs) and at the 3′ end of mRNAs. Using the cspE mRNA as a model for 3′ end targeting, we reveal a function for ProQ in protecting mRNA against exoribonucleolytic activity. Taken together, our results underpin the notion that ProQ governs a post-transcriptional network distinct from those of the well-characterized sRNA-binding proteins, CsrA and Hfq, and suggest a previously unrecognized, sRNA-independent role of ProQ in stabilizing mRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila imaginal disc cells exhibit a remarkable ability to convert cell fates in response to various perturbations, a phenomenon called transdetermination (TD). We previously identified winged eye (wge) as a factor that induces eye-to-wing TD upon overexpression in eye imaginal discs, but the molecular mechanisms underlying TD have remained largely unclear. Here, we found that wge induces various histone modifications and enhances the methylation of Lys9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a feature of heterochromatin. A histone methyltransferase, Su(var)3-9, is required for wge-mediated H3K9 methylation and eye-to-wing TD. Su(var)3-9 is also required for classical wound-induced TD but not for normal development, suggesting its involvement in several types of imaginal disc TDs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that wge represses eye identity genes independently of Su(var)3-9 and activates TD-related genes by acting together with Su(var)3-9. These findings provide new insights into diverse types of chromatin regulation at progressive steps of cell-fate conversions.

Abstract: Summary
Heightened effector function and prolonged persistence, the key attributes of Th1 and Th17 cells, respectively, are key features of potent anti-tumor T cells. Here, we established ex vivo culture conditions to generate hybrid Th1/17 cells, which persisted long-term in vivo while maintaining their effector function. Using transcriptomics and metabolic profiling approaches, we showed that the enhanced anti-tumor property of Th1/17 cells was dependent on the increased NAD+-dependent activity of the histone deacetylase Sirt1. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Sirt1 activity impaired the anti-tumor potential of Th1/17 cells. Importantly, T cells with reduced surface expression of the NADase CD38 exhibited intrinsically higher NAD+, enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, higher glutaminolysis, and altered mitochondrial dynamics that vastly improved tumor control. Lastly, blocking CD38 expression improved tumor control even when using Th0 anti-tumor T cells. Thus, strategies targeting the CD38-NAD+ axis could increase the efficacy of anti-tumor adoptive T cell therapy.

Abstract: The taxon Tardigrada, commonly called “water bears”, consists of microscopic, eight-legged invertebrates that are well known for their ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Their miniscule body size means that tardigrades possess a small total number of cells, the number and arrangement of which may be highly conserved in some organs. Although mitoses have been observed in several organs, the rate and pattern of cell divisions in adult tardigrades has never been characterized. In this study, we incubated live tardigrades over a period of several days with a thymidine analog in order to visualize all cells that had divided during this time. We focus on the midgut, the largest part of the digestive system. Our results show that new cells in the midgut arise from the anterior and posterior ends of this organ and either migrate or divide toward its middle. These cells divide at a constant rate and all cells of the midgut epithelium are replaced in approximately one week. On the other hand, we found no cell divisions in the nervous system or any other major organs, suggesting that the cell turnover of these organs may be extremely slow or dependent on changing environmental conditions.

Abstract: Summary
During sexual intercourse, HIV-1 crosses epithelial barriers composing the genital mucosa, a poorly understood feature that requires an HIV-1-infected cell vectoring efficient mucosal HIV-1 entry. Therefore, urethral mucosa comprising a polarized epithelium and a stroma composed of fibroblasts and macrophages were reconstructed in vitro. Using this system, we demonstrate by live imaging that efficient HIV-1 transmission to stromal macrophages depends on cell-mediated transfer of the virus through virological synapses formed between HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and the epithelial cell mucosal surface. We visualized HIV-1 translocation through mucosal epithelial cells via transcytosis in regions where virological synapses occurred. In turn, interleukin-13 is secreted and HIV-1 targets macrophages, which develop a latent state of infection reversed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation. The live observation of virological synapse formation reported herein is key in the design of vaccines and antiretroviral therapies aimed at blocking HIV-1 access to cellular reservoirs in genital mucosa.

Abstract: Summary
Bleach (HOCl) is a powerful oxidant that kills bacteria in part by causing protein aggregation. It inactivates ATP-dependent chaperones, rendering cellular proteins mostly dependent on holdases. Here we identified Escherichia coli CnoX (YbbN) as a folding factor that, when activated by bleach via chlorination, functions as an efficient holdase, protecting the substrates of the major folding systems GroEL/ES and DnaK/J/GrpE. Remarkably, CnoX uniquely combines this function with the ability to prevent the irreversible oxidation of its substrates. This dual activity makes CnoX the founding member of a family of proteins, the “chaperedoxins.” Because CnoX displays a thioredoxin fold and a tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain, two structural motifs conserved in all organisms, this investigation sets the stage for the discovery of additional chaperedoxins in bacteria and eukaryotes that could cooperate with proteins from both the Hsp60 and Hsp70 families.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is critical for thermoregulation and contributes to total energy expenditure. However, whether BAT has non-thermogenic functions is largely unknown. Here, we describe that BAT-specific liver kinase b1 knockout (Lkb1BKO) mice exhibited impaired BAT mitochondrial respiration and thermogenesis but reduced adiposity and liver triglyceride accumulation under high-fat-diet feeding at room temperature. Importantly, these metabolic benefits were also present in Lkb1BKO mice at thermoneutrality, where BAT thermogenesis was not required. Mechanistically, decreased mRNA levels of mtDNA-encoded electron transport chain (ETC) subunits and ETC proteome imbalance led to defective BAT mitochondrial respiration in Lkb1BKO mice. Furthermore, reducing mtDNA gene expression directly in BAT by removing mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in BAT also showed ETC proteome imbalance and the trade-off between BAT thermogenesis and systemic metabolism at room temperature and thermoneutrality. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ETC proteome imbalance in BAT regulates systemic metabolism independently of thermogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The effector B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein BCL-2 ovarian killer (BOK) induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) to initiate apoptosis upon inhibition of the proteasome. How BOK mediates MOMP is mechanistically unknown. The NMR structure of the BCL-2 core of human BOK reveals a conserved architecture with an atypical hydrophobic groove that undergoes conformational exchange. Remarkably, the BCL-2 core of BOK spontaneously associates with purified mitochondria to release cytochrome c in MOMP assays. Alanine substitution of a unique glycine in helix α1 stabilizes BOK, as shown by thermal shift and urea denaturation analyses, and significantly inhibits MOMP, liposome permeabilization, and cell death. Activated BID does not activate WT BOK or the stabilized alanine mutant to promote cell death. We propose that BOK-mediated membrane permeabilization is governed in part by its unique metastability of the hydrophobic groove and helix α1 and not through activation by BH3 ligands.

Abstract: Summary
The maintenance of eukaryotic genome stability is ensured by the interplay of transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms that control recombination of repeat regions and the expression and mobility of transposable elements. We report here that mutations in two (cytosine-5) RNA methyltransferases, Dnmt2 and NSun2, impact the accumulation of mobile element-derived sequences and DNA repeat integrity in Drosophila. Loss of Dnmt2 function caused moderate effects under standard conditions, while heat shock exacerbated these effects. In contrast, NSun2 function affected mobile element expression and genome integrity in a heat shock-independent fashion. Reduced tRNA stability in both RCMT mutants indicated that tRNA-dependent processes affected mobile element expression and DNA repeat stability. Importantly, further experiments indicated that complex formation with RNA could also contribute to the impact of RCMT function on gene expression control. These results thus uncover a link between tRNA modification enzymes, the expression of repeat DNA, and genomic integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar climbing-fiber-mediated complex spikes originate from neurons in the inferior olive (IO), are critical for motor coordination, and are central to theories of cerebellar learning. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels expressed by IO neurons have been considered as pacemaker currents important for oscillatory and resonant dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro, network actions of HCN1 channels enable bidirectional glutamatergic synaptic responses, while local actions of HCN1 channels determine the timing and waveform of synaptically driven action potentials. These roles are distinct from, and may complement, proposed pacemaker functions of HCN channels. We find that in behaving animals HCN1 channels reduce variability in the timing of cerebellar complex spikes, which serve as a readout of IO spiking. Our results suggest that spatially distributed actions of HCN1 channels enable the IO to implement network-wide rules for synaptic integration that modulate the timing of cerebellar climbing fiber signals.

Abstract: Summary
The Xenopus left-right organizer (LRO) breaks symmetry along the left-right axis of the early embryo by producing and sensing directed ciliary flow as a patterning cue. To carry out this process, the LRO contains different ciliated cell types that vary in cilia length, whether they are motile or sensory, and how they position their cilia along the anterior-posterior (A-P) planar axis. Here, we show that these different cilia features are specified in the prospective LRO during gastrulation, based on anisotropic mechanical strain that is oriented along the A-P axis, and graded in levels along the medial-lateral axis. Strain instructs ciliated cell differentiation by acting on a mesodermal prepattern present at blastula stages, involving foxj1. We propose that differential strain is a graded, developmental cue, linking the establishment of an A-P planar axis to cilia length, motility, and planar location during formation of the Xenopus LRO.
Keywords: left-right organizer; mechanical strain; cilia differentiation

Abstract: Summary
A carbohydrate-restricted diet is a widely recommended intervention for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but a systematic perspective on the multiple benefits of this diet is lacking. Here, we performed a short-term intervention with an isocaloric low-carbohydrate diet with increased protein content in obese subjects with NAFLD and characterized the resulting alterations in metabolism and the gut microbiota using a multi-omics approach. We observed rapid and dramatic reductions of liver fat and other cardiometabolic risk factors paralleled by (1) marked decreases in hepatic de novo lipogenesis; (2) large increases in serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, reflecting increased mitochondrial β-oxidation; and (3) rapid increases in folate-producing Streptococcus and serum folate concentrations. Liver transcriptomic analysis on biopsy samples from a second cohort revealed downregulation of the fatty acid synthesis pathway and upregulation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism and fatty acid oxidation pathways. Our results highlight the potential of exploring diet-microbiota interactions for treating NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
Female hawkmoths, Manduca sexta, use olfactory cues to locate nectar sources and oviposition sites. We investigated if the behavioral significance of odorants is represented already in the antennal lobe, the first olfactory neuropil of the insect′s brain. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we first established a functional map of the dorsal surface of the antennal lobe by stimulating the moths with 80 ecologically relevant and chemically diverse monomolecular odorants. We were able to address 23 olfactory glomeruli, functional subunits of the antennal lobe, in each individual female. Next, we studied the relevance of the same odorants with two-choice experiments (odorant versus solvent) in a wind tunnel. Depending on odorant identity, naive moths made attempts to feed or to oviposit at the scented targets. A correlation of wind tunnel results with glomerular activation patterns revealed that feeding and oviposition behaviors are encoded in the moth’s antennal lobe by the activation of distinct groups of glomeruli.

Abstract: Summary
The lysine-specific demethylase KDM1A is a key regulator of stem cell potential in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). ORY-1001 is a highly potent and selective KDM1A inhibitor that induces H3K4me2 accumulation on KDM1A target genes, blast differentiation, and reduction of leukemic stem cell capacity in AML. ORY-1001 exhibits potent synergy with standard-of-care drugs and selective epigenetic inhibitors, reduces growth of an AML xenograft model, and extends survival in a mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) model of T cell acute leukemia. Surrogate pharmacodynamic biomarkers developed based on expression changes in leukemia cell lines were translated to samples from patients treated with ORY-1001. ORY-1001 is a selective KDM1A inhibitor in clinical trials and is currently being evaluated in patients with leukemia and solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
In cells, specific regulators often compete for limited amounts of a core enzymatic resource. It is typically assumed that competition leads to partitioning of core enzyme molecules among regulators at constant levels. Alternatively, however, different regulatory species could time share, or take turns utilizing, the core resource. Using quantitative time-lapse microscopy, we analyzed sigma factor activity dynamics, and their competition for RNA polymerase, in individual Bacillus subtilis cells under energy stress. Multiple alternative sigma factors were activated in ∼1-hr pulses in stochastic and repetitive fashion. Pairwise analysis revealed that two sigma factors rarely pulse simultaneously and that some pairs are anti-correlated, indicating that RNAP utilization alternates among different sigma factors. Mathematical modeling revealed how stochastic time-sharing dynamics can emerge from pulse-generating sigma factor regulatory circuits actively competing for RNAP. Time sharing provides a mechanism for cells to dynamically control the distribution of cell states within a population. Since core molecular components are limiting in many other systems, time sharing may represent a general mode of regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatin plays a central role in the process of immune evasion, pathogenesis, and transmission of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum during blood stage infection. Here, we use ChIP sequencing to demonstrate that sporozoites from mosquito salivary glands expand heterochromatin at subtelomeric regions to silence blood-stage-specific genes. Our data also revealed that heterochromatin enrichment is predictive of the transcription status of clonally variant genes members that mediate cytoadhesion in blood stage parasites. A specific member (here called NF54varsporo) of the var gene family remains euchromatic, and the resultant PfEMP1 (NF54_SpzPfEMP1) is expressed at the sporozoite surface. NF54_SpzPfEMP1-specific antibodies efficiently block hepatocyte infection in a strain-specific manner. Furthermore, human volunteers immunized with infective sporozoites developed antibodies against NF54_SpzPfEMP1. Overall, we show that the epigenetic signature of var genes is reset in mosquito stages. Moreover, the identification of a strain-specific sporozoite PfEMP1 is highly relevant for vaccine design based on sporozoites.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and signaling factors often co-occur in myeloid malignancies, including TET2 and NRAS mutations. Concurrent Tet2 loss and NrasG12D expression in hematopoietic cells induced myeloid transformation, with a fully penetrant, lethal chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), which was serially transplantable. Tet2 loss and Nras mutation cooperatively led to decrease in negative regulators of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, including Spry2, thereby causing synergistic activation of MAPK signaling by epigenetic silencing. Tet2/Nras double-mutant leukemia showed preferential sensitivity to MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibition in both mouse model and patient samples. These data provide insights into how epigenetic and signaling mutations cooperate in myeloid transformation and provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapy in CMML patients with these high-risk genetic lesions.

Abstract: Summary
The murine embryonic blood-brain barrier (BBB) consists of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes (PCs), and basement membrane. Although PCs are critical for inducing vascular stability, signaling pathways in PCs that regulate EC morphogenesis during BBB development remain unexplored. Herein, we find that murine embryos lacking the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptor activin receptor-like kinase 5 (Alk5) in brain PCs (mutants) develop gross germinal matrix hemorrhage-intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH). The germinal matrix (GM) is a highly vascularized structure rich in neuronal and glial precursors. We show that GM microvessels of mutants display abnormal dilation, reduced PC coverage, EC hyperproliferation, reduced basement membrane collagen, and enhanced perivascular matrix metalloproteinase activity. Furthermore, ALK5-depleted PCs downregulate tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), and TIMP3 administration to mutants improves endothelial morphogenesis and attenuates GMH-IVH. Overall, our findings reveal a key role for PC ALK5 in regulating brain endothelial morphogenesis and a substantial therapeutic potential for TIMP3 during GMH-IVH.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the clinical successes fostered by immune checkpoint inhibitors, mechanisms underlying PD-1 upregulation in tumor-infiltrating T cells remain an enigma. Here, we show that tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs) drive PD-1 upregulation in CD8+ T cells through a transcellular kynurenine (Kyn)-aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. Interferon-γ produced by CD8+ T cells stimulates release of high levels of Kyn produced by TRCs, which is transferred into adjacent CD8+ T cells via the transporters SLC7A8 and PAT4. Kyn induces and activates AhR and thereby upregulates PD-1 expression. This Kyn-AhR pathway is confirmed in both tumor-bearing mice and cancer patients and its blockade enhances antitumor adoptive T cell therapy efficacy. Thus, we uncovered a mechanism of PD-1 upregulation with potential tumor immunotherapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Although single-cell RNA sequencing can reliably detect large-scale transcriptional programs, it is unclear whether it accurately captures the behavior of individual genes, especially those that express only in rare cells. Here, we use single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization as a gold standard to assess trade-offs in single-cell RNA-sequencing data for detecting rare cell expression variability. We quantified the gene expression distribution for 26 genes that range from ubiquitous to rarely expressed and found that the correspondence between estimates across platforms improved with both transcriptome coverage and increased number of cells analyzed. Further, by characterizing the trade-off between transcriptome coverage and number of cells analyzed, we show that when the number of genes required to answer a given biological question is small, then greater transcriptome coverage is more important than analyzing large numbers of cells. More generally, our report provides guidelines for selecting quality thresholds for single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments aimed at rare cell analyses.

Abstract: The glycoconjugates pattern of acidic secretions and distribution of chemosensory cells (SCCs) in the respiratory mucosa of dromedary camels were analyzed so as to identify their functional role. Secretions of the goblet cells and mucous glandular cells were analyzed to evaluate the variety of sugar chains, focusing on the acidic glycoconjugates. Using lectin histochemistry, WGA, STL, DBA, SBA, VVA and RCA-120 intensely bound to the goblet cells. PNA and ECL labeled the goblet cells with moderate intensity. While, s-WGA, UEA-I faintly bound to them. Lectins bound to the glycocalyx: WGA, LEL, STL, DSL, DBA, SBA, VVA, RCA-120, ECL and PHA-L (tetra- and tri-antennary N-glycans). The mucous secretory cells reacted with: WGA, s-WGA, STL, DBA, SBA, ECL and Con A. Glycoconjugates secreted by the camel respiratory mucosa are rich in sialomucins, glucosaminy-lated residuals with some galactosyl/galactosaminylated residues; few L-fucose and mannosylated sugar residues are also included. For identification of SCCs, the camel respiratory mucosa was immunostained with phospholipase C-β2 (PLC-β2), a taste signaling marker. Several PLC-β2 immunoreactive cells were detected in camel respiratory epithelium. Finally, prevalence of sialomucins and SCCs which can respond to noxious chemicals may suggest a vital role in optimizing physiological and pathological reactions in camel respiratory mucosa.

Abstract: Summary
To achieve adaptive and heritable immunity against viruses and other mobile genetic elements, CRISPR-Cas systems must capture and store short DNA fragments (spacers) from these foreign elements into host genomic CRISPR arrays. This process is catalyzed by conserved Cas1/Cas2 integration complexes, but the specific roles of another highly conserved protein linked to spacer acquisition, the Cas4 nuclease, are just now emerging. Here, we show that two Cas4 nucleases (Cas4-1 and Cas4-2) play critical roles in CRISPR spacer acquisition in Pyrococcus furiosus. The nuclease activities of both Cas4 proteins are required to process protospacers to the correct size. Cas4-1 specifies the upstream PAM (protospacer adjacent motif), while Cas4-2 specifies the conserved downstream motif. Both Cas4 proteins ensure CRISPR spacer integration in a defined orientation leading to CRISPR immunity. Collectively, these findings provide in vivo evidence for critical roles of Cas4 nucleases in protospacer generation and functional spacer integration at CRISPR arrays.

Abstract: Summary
The protection and efficient restart of stalled replication forks is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity. Here, we identify a regulatory pathway that promotes stalled forks recovery from replication stress. We show that the mammalian replisome component C20orf43/RTF2 (homologous to S. pombe Rtf2) must be removed for fork restart to be optimal. We further show that the proteasomal shuttle proteins DDI1 and DDI2 are required for RTF2 removal from stalled forks. Persistence of RTF2 at stalled forks results in fork restart defects, hyperactivation of the DNA damage signal, accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), sensitivity to replication drugs, and chromosome instability. These results establish that RTF2 removal is a key determinant for the ability of cells to manage replication stress and maintain genome integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-dependent upper small intestinal lipid metabolism activates pre-absorptive pathways to regulate metabolic homeostasis, but whether changes in the upper small intestinal microbiota alter specific fatty acid-dependent pathways to impact glucose homeostasis remains unknown. We here first find that upper small intestinal infusion of Intralipid, oleic acid, or linoleic acid pre-absorptively increases glucose tolerance and lowers glucose production in rodents. High-fat feeding impairs pre-absorptive fatty acid sensing and reduces upper small intestinal Lactobacillus gasseri levels and ACSL3 expression. Transplantation of healthy upper small intestinal microbiota to high-fat-fed rodents restores L. gasseri levels and fatty acid sensing via increased ACSL3 expression, while L. gasseri probiotic administration to non-transplanted high-fat-fed rodents is sufficient to restore upper small intestinal ACSL3 expression and fatty acid sensing. In summary, we unveil a glucoregulatory role of upper small intestinal L. gasseri that impacts an ACSL3-dependent glucoregulatory fatty acid-sensing pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3 or RIPK3) is a central protein in necroptosis, but posttranslational processes that regulate RIP3 activity and stability remain poorly understood. Here, we identify pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (PELI1) as an E3 ligase that targets RIP3 for proteasome-dependent degradation. Phosphorylation of RIP3 on T182 leads to interaction with the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of PELI1 and PELI1-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitylation of RIP3 on K363. This same phosphorylation event is also important for RIP3 kinase activity; thus, PELI1 preferentially targets kinase-active RIP3 for degradation. PELI1-mediated RIP3 degradation effectively prevents cell death triggered by RIP3 hyperactivation. Importantly, upregulated RIP3 expression in keratinocytes from toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) patients is correlated with low expression of PELI1, suggesting that loss of PELI1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of TEN. We propose that PELI1 may function to control inadvertent activation of RIP3, thus preventing aberrant cell death and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) represent output channels of the cerebellum, and they transmit integrated sensorimotor signals to modulate limb movements. But the functional relevance of identifiable neuronal subpopulations within the DCN remains unclear. Here, we examine a genetically tractable population of neurons in the mouse interposed anterior nucleus (IntA). We show that these neurons represent a subset of glutamatergic neurons in the IntA and constitute a specific element of an internal feedback circuit within the cerebellar cortex and cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway associated with limb control. Ablation and optogenetic stimulation of these neurons disrupt efficacy of skilled reach and locomotor movement and reveal that they control positioning and timing of the forelimb and hindlimb. Together, our findings uncover the function of a distinct neuronal subpopulation in the deep cerebellum and delineate the anatomical substrates and kinematic parameters through which it modulates precision of discrete and rhythmic limb movements.

Abstract: Summary
We demonstrate that cortical interneurons derived from ventral eminences, including the caudal ganglionic eminence, undergo programmed cell death. Moreover, with the exception of VIP interneurons, this occurs in a manner that is activity-dependent. In addition, we demonstrate that, within interneurons, Calcineurin, a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, plays a critical role in sequentially linking activity to maturation (E15–P5) and survival (P5–P20). Specifically, embryonic inactivation of Calcineurin results in a failure of interneurons to morphologically mature and prevents them from undergoing apoptosis. By contrast, early postnatal inactivation of Calcineurin increases apoptosis. We conclude that Calcineurin serves a dual role of promoting first the differentiation of interneurons and, subsequently, their survival.

For high throughput assays simple and inexpensive techniques are desirable. Many calcium channels that serve as drug targets have subtypes arising from diverse subunit combinations. These need to be targeted selectively for achieving efficacy and for avoiding side effects in therapies. This in turn increases the number of calcium channels that act as drug targets. We report a novel method for intracellular calcium sensing that utilizes the calcium dependent stable interaction between CaM kinase II (CaMKII) and its ligands such as the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B. The CaMKII-GluN2B complex formed persists as a memory of the transient increase in calcium. In a cell-based assay system GFP-α-CaMKII expressed in the cytosol responds to calcium by translocating towards GluN2B sequence motif exogenously expressed on mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum. The resulting punctate fluorescence pattern serves as the signal for intracellular calcium release. The pattern is stable, unaffected by sample processing and is observable without real time imaging. The activities of calcium channel proteins heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells were detected with specificity using this technique. A calcium sensor vector and a calcium sensor cell line were developed as tools to perform this technique. This technique being simple and less expensive could significantly facilitate high throughput screening in calcium channel drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Expression of PKM2, which diverts glucose-derived carbon from catabolic to biosynthetic pathways, is a hallmark of cancer. However, PKM2 function in tumorigenesis remains controversial. Here, we show that, when expressed rather than PKM2, the PKM isoform PKM1 exhibits a tumor-promoting function in KRASG12D-induced or carcinogen-initiated mouse models or in some human cancers. Analysis of Pkm mutant mouse lines expressing specific PKM isoforms established that PKM1 boosts tumor growth cell intrinsically. PKM1 activated glucose catabolism and stimulated autophagy/mitophagy, favoring malignancy. Importantly, we observed that pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), including small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), express PKM1, and that PKM1 expression is required for SCLC cell proliferation. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting PKM1 therapeutically in certain cancer subtypes, including pulmonary NETs.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) display an abbreviated cell cycle, resulting in a short doubling time and rapid proliferation. The histone variant H2A.X is critical for proliferation of stem cells, although mechanistic insights have remained obscure. Here, we show that H2A.X defines the rate of mouse ESC proliferation independently of the DNA damage response pathway, and it associates with three major chromatin-modifying complexes. Our functional and biochemical analyses demonstrate that H2A.X-associated factors mediate the H2A.X-dependent effect on ESC proliferation and involve the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC). A specific H2A.X deposition at rDNA promoters determines the chromatin recruitment of the NoRC, histone modifications, the rRNA transcription, and the rate of proliferation. Collectively, our results suggest that NoRC assembly by H2A.X deposition at rRNA promoters silences transcription, and this represents an important regulatory component for ESC proliferation.

Abstract: Background
We havebeen attempting to use cardiac spheroids to construct three-dimensional contractilestructures for failed hearts. Recent studies have reported that neuralprogenitors (NPs) play significant roles in heart regeneration. However, theeffect of NPs on the cardiac spheroid has not yet been elucidated.
Objective
This studyaims to demonstrate the influence of NPs on the function of cardiac spheroids.
Methods
Thespheroids were constructed on a low-attachment-well plate by mixing humaninduced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes and hiPScell-derived NPs (hiPS-NPs). The ratio of hiPS-NPs was set at 0%, 10%, 20%,30%, and 40% of the total cell number of spheroids, which was 2500. The motionwas recorded, and the fractional shortening and the contraction velocity weremeasured.
Results
Spheroidswere formed within 48 h after mixing the cells, except for the spheroidscontaining 0% hiPS-NPs. Observation at day 7 revealed significant differencesin the fractional shortening (analysis of variance; p = 0.01). The bestfractional shortening was observed with the spheroids containing 30% hiPS-NPs.Neuronal cells were detected morphologically within the spheroids under aconfocal microscope.
Conclusion
Theaddition of hiPS-NPs influenced the contractile function of the cardiacspheroids. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism.

Abstract: Proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from biological fluid is a powerful approach to discover potential biomarkers for human diseases including cancers, as EV secreted to biological fluids are originated from the affected tissue. In order to investigate significant molecules related to the pathogenesis of bladder cancer, EVs were isolated from patient urine which was analyzed by mass spectrometry based proteomics. Comparison of the EV proteome to the whole urine proteome demonstrated an increased number of protein identification in EV. Comparative MS analyses of urinary EV from control subjects and bladder cancer patients identified a total of 1,222 proteins. Statistical analyses provided 56 proteins significantly increased in bladder cancer urine, including proteins for which expression levels varied by cancer stage (P-value < 0.05). While urine represents a valuable, noninvasive specimen for biomarker discovery in urologic cancers, there is a high degree of intra- and inter-individual variability in urine samples. The enrichment of urinary EV demonstrated its capability and applicability of providing a focused identification of biologically relevant proteins in urological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) orchestrate the production, processing, and function of mRNAs. Here, we present the affinity landscapes of 78 human RBPs using an unbiased assay that determines the sequence, structure, and context preferences of these proteins in vitro by deep sequencing of bound RNAs. These data enable construction of “RNA maps” of RBP activity without requiring crosslinking-based assays. We found an unexpectedly low diversity of RNA motifs, implying frequent convergence of binding specificity toward a relatively small set of RNA motifs, many with low compositional complexity. Offsetting this trend, however, we observed extensive preferences for contextual features distinct from short linear RNA motifs, including spaced “bipartite” motifs, biased flanking nucleotide composition, and bias away from or toward RNA structure. Our results emphasize the importance of contextual features in RNA recognition, which likely enable targeting of distinct subsets of transcripts by different RBPs that recognize the same linear motif.

Abstract: We studied the effect of alcohol on the pineal gland of 48 male Wistar rats. Animals were divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group underwent a previous progressive alcoholisation period with ethanol diluted in water at a concentration of 40%. Animals were sacrificed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and the ultrastructure, karyometric indices, and number of synaptic bodies in the pineal gland were analysed. The results showed progressive morphologic alterations in the ethanol-treated animals, which culminated in fatty degeneration of the pineal parenchyma after 6 months. The karyometric indices decreased in both the central and peripheral areas compared with the control group. Moreover, the seasonal rhythmicity observed in the controls disappeared in the experimental groups, whose number of different populations of synaptic bodies (synaptic ribbons and synaptic spherules) considerably lowered with inversion of their normal seasonal rhythm. These results support that chronic alcoholisation leads to fatty degeneration of the pineal parenchyma, and a considerable alteration in nuclear functional rhythms and synaptic bodies.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence suggests that metabolic master regulators, including mTOR, regulate adaptive and innate immune responses. Resident mesenchymal tissue components are increasingly recognized as key effector cells in inflammation. Whether mTOR also controls the inflammatory response in fibroblasts is insufficiently studied. Here, we show that TNF signaling co-opts the mTOR pathway to shift synovial fibroblast (FLS) inflammation toward an IFN response. mTOR pathway activation is associated with decreased NF-κB-mediated gene expression (e.g., PTGS2, IL-6, and IL-8) but increased STAT1-dependent gene expression (e.g., CXCL11 and TNFSF13B). We further demonstrate how metabolic inputs, such as amino acids, impinge on TNF-mTORC1 signaling to differentially regulate pro-inflammatory signaling circuits. Our results define a critical role for mTOR in the regulation of the pro-inflammatory response in FLSs and unfold its pathogenic involvement in TNF-driven diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Abstract: Summary
BAR domains are dimeric protein modules that sense, induce, and stabilize lipid membrane curvature. Here, we show that membrane curvature sensing (MCS) directs cellular localization and function of the BAR domain protein PICK1. In PICK1, and the homologous proteins ICA69 and arfaptin2, we identify an amphipathic helix N-terminal to the BAR domain that mediates MCS. Mutational disruption of the helix in PICK1 impaired MCS without affecting membrane binding per se. In insulin-producing INS-1E cells, super-resolution microscopy revealed that disruption of the helix selectively compromised PICK1 density on insulin granules of high curvature during their maturation. This was accompanied by reduced hormone storage in the INS-1E cells. In Drosophila, disruption of the helix compromised growth regulation. By demonstrating size-dependent binding on insulin granules, our finding highlights the function of MCS for BAR domain proteins in a biological context distinct from their function, e.g., at the plasma membrane during endocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) determines cerebellar granule cell (GC) progenitor proliferation and medulloblastoma pathogenesis. However, the pathways regulating GC progenitors during embryogenesis before Shh production by Purkinje neurons and their roles in tumorigenesis remain unclear. The cilium-localized G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr161 suppresses Shh-mediated signaling in the neural tube. Here, by deleting Gpr161 in mouse neural stem cells or GC progenitors, we establish Gpr161 as a tumor suppressor in Shh subtype medulloblastoma. Irrespective of Shh production in the cerebellum, Gpr161 deletion increased downstream activity of the Shh pathway by restricting Gli3-mediated repression, causing more extensive generation and proliferation of GC progenitors. Moreover, earlier deletion of Gpr161 during embryogenesis increased tumor incidence and severity. GC progenitor overproduction during embryogenesis from Gpr161 deletion was cilium dependent, unlike normal development. Low GPR161 expression correlated with poor survival of SHH subtype medulloblastoma patients. Gpr161 restricts GC progenitor production by preventing premature and Shh-dependent pathway activity, highlighting the importance of basal pathway suppression in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Nup133 belongs to the Y-complex, a key component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold. Studies on a null mutation in mice previously revealed that Nup133 is essential for embryonic development but not for mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) proliferation. Using single-pore detection and average NE-fluorescence intensity, we find that Nup133 is dispensable for interphase and postmitotic NPC scaffold assembly in pluripotent mESCs. However, loss of Nup133 specifically perturbs the formation of the nuclear basket as manifested by the absence of Tpr in about half of the NPCs combined with altered dynamics of Nup153. We further demonstrate that its central domain mediates Nup133’s role in assembling Tpr and Nup153 into a properly configured nuclear basket. Our findings thus revisit the role of the Y-complex in pore biogenesis and provide insights into the interplay between NPC scaffold architecture, nuclear basket assembly, and the generation of heterogeneity among NPCs.

Abstract: Summary
HOX proteins achieve numerous functions by interacting with the TALE class PBX and MEIS cofactors. In contrast to this established partnership in development and disease, how HOX proteins could interact with PBX and MEIS remains unclear. Here, we present a systematic analysis of HOX/PBX/MEIS interaction properties, scanning all paralog groups with human and mouse HOX proteins in vitro and in live cells. We demonstrate that a previously characterized HOX protein motif known to be critical for HOX-PBX interactions becomes dispensable in the presence of MEIS in all except the two most anterior paralog groups. We further identify paralog-specific TALE-binding sites that are used in a highly context-dependent manner. One of these binding sites is involved in the proliferative activity of HOXA7 in breast cancer cells. Together these findings reveal an extraordinary level of interaction flexibility between HOX proteins and their major class of developmental cofactors.

Abstract: Hard end is a physiological disorder of pear fruit that is frequently observed in the ‘Whangkeumbae’ (Pyrus pyrifolia) variety, however, the mechanisms that are involved in its development are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the causes of hard end disorder in pear fruit in relation to calcium deficiency. During fruit development, the ratio of Ca/N, Ca/K, Ca/Mg and the content of B were significantly lower in the hard end fruit as compared to normal fruit. However, no calcium deficiency was detected in the soil and leaves of the orchard where the hard end fruit were located. Additionally, the Ca2+ influx in the calyx of hard end fruit was lower than that of normal fruit at 90 d after anthesis. The free Ca2+ and storage Ca2+ in the flesh cells of hard end fruit were less than that of normal fruit during fruit development, while an opposite tendency was observed at 120 d after anthesis (harvest day). In hard end fruit, the Ca2+ transport-related gene, PpCNGC1 (Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel 1), was up-regulated; whereas the Ca2+ sensor-related genes of PpCIPKs, PpCDPK28 and PpCML41 were all down-regulated. Spraying with a 2% calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution inhibited the incidence rate of hard end disorder and decreased fruit firmness and lignin content during storage. Additionally, the ratio of Ca/N, Ca/K, Ca/Mg and the content of B all increased on harvest day. Our study suggests that low Ca2+ influx leads to less Ca2+ into the pear fruit, which results in an intracellular imbalance of Ca2+ and consequently triggers the development of hard end disorder.

Abstract: Summary
Receptors show promise for the transport of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) across the blood-brain barrier. However, safety liabilities associated with peripheral receptor binding and Fc effector function have been reported. We present the Brain Shuttle-mAb (BS-mAb) technology, and we investigate the role of Fc effector function in vitro and in an Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-humanized mouse model. Strong first infusion reactions (FIRs) were observed for a conventional mAb against transferrin receptor (TfR) with a wild-type immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc. Fc effector-dead constructs completely eliminated all FIRs. Remarkably, no FIR was observed for the BS-mAb construct with a native IgG1 Fc function. Using various BS-mAb constructs, we show that TfR binding through the C-terminal BS module attenuates Fc-FcγR interactions, primarily because of steric hindrance. Nevertheless, BS-mAbs maintain effector function activity when binding their brain target. Thus, mAbs with full effector function can be transported in a stealth mode in the periphery while fully active when engaged with their brain target.

Abstract: Summary
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are regulated by diverse stimuli comprising thermal, chemical, and mechanical modalities. They are also commonly regulated by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), with underlying mechanisms largely unknown. We here revealed an intramolecular interaction of the TRPP3 N and C termini (N-C) that is functionally essential. The interaction was mediated by aromatic Trp81 in pre-S1 domain and cationic Lys568 in TRP-like domain. Structure-function analyses revealed similar N-C interaction in TRPP2 as well as TRPM8/-V1/-C4 via highly conserved tryptophan and lysine/arginine residues. PIP2 bound to cationic residues in TRPP3, including K568, thereby disrupting the N-C interaction and negatively regulating TRPP3. PIP2 had similar negative effects on TRPP2. Interestingly, we found that PIP2 facilitates the N-C interaction in TRPM8/-V1, resulting in channel potentiation. The intramolecular N-C interaction might represent a shared mechanism underlying the gating and PIP2 regulation of TRP channels.

Abstract: Summary
The transplantation of pluripotent stem-cell-derived neurons constitutes a promising avenue for the treatment of several brain diseases. However, their potential for the repair of the cerebral cortex remains unclear, given its complexity and neuronal diversity. Here, we show that human visual cortical cells differentiated from embryonic stem cells can be transplanted and can integrate successfully into the lesioned mouse adult visual cortex. The transplanted human neurons expressed the appropriate repertoire of markers of six cortical layers, projected axons to specific visual cortical targets, and were synaptically active within the adult brain. Moreover, transplant maturation and integration were much less efficient following transplantation into the lesioned motor cortex, as previously observed for transplanted mouse cortical neurons. These data constitute an important milestone for the potential use of human PSC-derived cortical cells for the reassembly of cortical circuits and emphasize the importance of cortical areal identity for successful transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
The morphological transformation of amorphous chromatin into distinct chromosomes is a hallmark of mitosis. To achieve this, chromatin must be compacted and remodeled by a ring-shaped enzyme complex known as condensin. However, the mechanistic basis underpinning condensin’s role in chromosome remodeling has remained elusive. Here we show that condensin has a strong tendency to trap itself in its own reaction product during chromatin compaction and yet is capable of interacting with chromatin in a highly dynamic manner in vivo. To resolve this apparent paradox, we identified specific chromatin remodelers and AAA-class ATPases that act in a coordinated manner to release condensin from chromatin entrapment. The Cdc48 segregase is the central linchpin of this regulatory mechanism and promotes ubiquitin-dependent cycling of condensin on mitotic chromatin as well as effective chromosome condensation. Collectively, our results show that condensin inhibition by its own reaction product is relieved by forceful enzyme extraction from chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza virus intimately associates with host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and mRNA processing machinery. Here, we use mammalian native elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq) to examine Pol II behavior during viral infection. We show that influenza virus executes a two-pronged attack on host transcription. First, viral infection causes decreased Pol II gene occupancy downstream of transcription start sites. Second, virus-induced cellular stress leads to a catastrophic failure of Pol II termination at poly(A) sites, with transcription often continuing for tens of kilobases. Defective Pol II termination occurs independently of the ability of the viral NS1 protein to interfere with host mRNA processing. Instead, this termination defect is a common effect of diverse cellular stresses and underlies the production of previously reported downstream-of-gene transcripts (DoGs). Our work has implications for understanding not only host-virus interactions but also fundamental aspects of mammalian transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Super-enhancers are large clusters of enhancers that activate gene expression. Broad trimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) often defines active tumor suppressor genes. However, how these epigenomic signatures are regulated for tumor suppression is little understood. Here we show that brain-specific knockout of the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL4 (a COMPASS-like enzyme, also known as KMT2D) in mice spontaneously induces medulloblastoma. Mll4 loss upregulates oncogenic Ras and Notch pathways while downregulating neuronal gene expression programs. MLL4 enhances DNMT3A-catalyzed DNA methylation and SIRT1/BCL6-mediated H4K16 deacetylation, which antagonize expression of Ras activators and Notch pathway components, respectively. Notably, Mll4 loss downregulates tumor suppressor genes (e.g., Dnmt3a and Bcl6) by diminishing broad H3K4me3 and super-enhancers and also causes widespread impairment of these epigenomic signatures during medulloblastoma genesis. These findings suggest an anti-tumor role for super-enhancers and provide a unique tumor-suppressive mechanism in which MLL4 is necessary to maintain broad H3K4me3 and super-enhancers at tumor suppressor genes.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication in the embryo of Xenopus laevis changes dramatically at the mid-blastula transition (MBT), with Y RNA-independent random initiation switching to Y RNA-dependent initiation at specific origins. Here, we identify xNuRD, an MTA2-containing assemblage of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex NuRD, as an essential factor in pre-MBT Xenopus embryos that overcomes a functional requirement for Y RNAs during DNA replication. Human NuRD complexes have a different subunit composition than xNuRD and do not support Y RNA-independent initiation of DNA replication. Blocking or immunodepletion of xNuRD inhibits DNA replication initiation in isolated nuclei in vitro and causes inhibition of DNA synthesis, developmental delay, and embryonic lethality in early embryos. xNuRD activity declines after the MBT, coinciding with dissociation of the complex and emergence of Y RNA-dependent initiation. Our data thus reveal an essential role for a NuRD complex as a DNA replication factor during early Xenopus development.

Abstract: Alternative models such as three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures represent a distinct milestone towards capturing the realities of cancer biology in vitro and reduce animal experimentation in the preclinical stage of drug discovery. Significant work remains to be done to understand how substrates used in in vitro alternatives influence cancer cells phenotype and drug efficacy responses, so that to accurately link such models to specific in vivo disease scenarios. Our study describes how the morphological, mechanical and biochemical properties of adenocarcinoma (A549) cells change in response to a 3D environment and varying substrates. Confocal Laser Scanning (LSCM), He-Ion (HIM) and Atomic Force (AFM) microscopies, supported by ELISA and Western blotting, were used. These techniques enabled us to evaluate the shape, cytoskeletal organization, roughness, stiffness and biochemical signatures of cells grown within soft 3D matrices (PuraMatrix™ and Matrigel™), and to compare them to those of cells cultured on two-dimensional glass substrates. Cell cultures are also characterized for their biological response to docetaxel, a taxane-type drug used in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Our results offer an advanced biophysical insight into the properties and potential application of 3D cultures of A549 cells as in vitro alternatives in lung cancer research.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are strategically positioned to mediate neuronal plasticity because of their influence on action potential waveform. VGSC function may be strongly inhibited by local anesthetic and antiepileptic drugs and modestly modulated via second messenger pathways. Here, we report that the allosteric modulators of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) cinacalcet, calindol, calhex, and NPS 2143 completely inhibit VGSC current in the vast majority of cultured mouse neocortical neurons. This form of VGSC current block persisted in CaSR-deficient neurons, indicating a CaSR-independent mechanism. Cinacalcet-mediated blockade of VGSCs was prevented by the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) analog GDPβs, indicating that G-proteins mediated this effect. Cinacalcet inhibited VGSCs by increasing channel inactivation, and block was reversed by prolonged hyperpolarization. Strong cinacalcet inhibition of VGSC currents was also present in acutely isolated mouse cortical neurons. These data identify a dynamic signaling pathway by which G-proteins regulate VGSC current to indirectly modulate central neuronal excitability.

Abstract: Summary
The peripheral protein quality control (QC) system removes non-native membrane proteins, including ΔF508-CFTR, the most common CFTR mutant in cystic fibrosis (CF), from the plasma membrane (PM) for lysosomal degradation by ubiquitination. It remains unclear how unfolded membrane proteins are recognized and targeted for ubiquitination and how they are removed from the apical PM. Using comprehensive siRNA screens, we identified RFFL, an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that directly and selectively recognizes unfolded ΔF508-CFTR through its disordered regions. RFFL retrieves the unfolded CFTR from the PM for lysosomal degradation by chaperone-independent K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. RFFL ablation enhanced the functional expression of cell-surface ΔF508-CFTR in the presence of folding corrector molecules, and this effect was further improved by inhibiting the Hsc70-dependent ubiquitination machinery. We propose that multiple peripheral QC mechanisms evolved to dispose of non-native PM proteins and to preserve cellular proteostasis, even at the cost of eliminating partially functional polypeptides.

Abstract: Summary
Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that detect mechanical and chemical stimuli. Although cilia house a number of oncogenic molecules (including Smoothened, KRAS, EGFR, and PDGFR), their precise role in cancer remains unclear. We have interrogated the role of cilia in acquired and de novo resistance to a variety of kinase inhibitors, and found that, in several examples, resistant cells are distinctly characterized by an increase in the number and/or length of cilia with altered structural features. Changes in ciliation seem to be linked to differences in the molecular composition of cilia and result in enhanced Hedgehog pathway activation. Notably, manipulating cilia length via Kif7 knockdown is sufficient to confer drug resistance in drug-sensitive cells. Conversely, targeting of cilia length or integrity through genetic and pharmacological approaches overcomes kinase inhibitor resistance. Our work establishes a role for ciliogenesis and cilia length in promoting cancer drug resistance and has significant translational implications.

Abstract: microRNA (miR)-612 shows anticancer activity in several types of cancers, yet its function in melanoma is still unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of miR-612 and its biological relevance in melanoma cell growth, invasion, and tumorigenesis. The expression and prognostic significance of miR-612 in melanoma were examined. The effects of miR-612 overexpression on cell proliferation, colony formation, tumorigenesis, and invasion were determined. Rescue experiments were conducted to identify the functional target gene(s) of miR-612. miR-612 was significantly downregulated in melanoma tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Low miR-612 expression was significantly associated with melanoma thickness, lymph node metastasis, and shorter overall, and disease-free survival of patients. Overexpression of miR-612 significantly decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion of SK-MEL-28 and A375 melanoma cells. In vivo tumorigenic studies confirmed that miR-612 overexpression retarded the growth of A375 xenograft tumors, which was coupled with a decline in the percentage of Ki-67-positive proliferating cells. Mechanistically, miR-612 targeted Espin in melanoma cells. Overexpression of Espin counteracted the suppressive effects of miR-612 on melanoma cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis. A significant inverse correlation (r = −0.376, P = 0.018) was observed between miR-612 and Espin protein expression in melanoma tissues. In addition, overexpression of miR-612 and knockdown of Espin significantly increased the sensitivity of melanoma cells to doxorubicin. Collectively, miR-612 suppresses the aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells through downregulation of Espin. Delivery of miR-612 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic assemblies of mRNPs stalled in translation initiation. They are induced by various stress conditions, including exposure to the environmental toxin and carcinogen arsenic. While perturbed SG turnover is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular mechanisms underlying SG formation and turnover are still poorly understood. Here, we show that ZFAND1 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of SG clearance. ZFAND1 interacts with two key factors of protein degradation, the 26S proteasome and the ubiquitin-selective segregase p97, and recruits them to arsenite-induced SGs. In the absence of ZFAND1, SGs lack the 26S proteasome and p97, accumulate defective ribosomal products, and persist after arsenite removal, indicating their transformation into aberrant, disease-linked SGs. Accordingly, ZFAND1 depletion is epistatic to the expression of pathogenic mutant p97 with respect to SG clearance, suggesting that ZFAND1 function is relevant to the multisystem degenerative disorder IBMPFD/ALS.

Abstract: Summary
Translation of mRNAs is tightly regulated and constantly surveyed for errors. Aberrant translation can trigger co-translational protein and RNA quality control processes, impairments of which cause neurodegeneration by still poorly understood mechanism(s). Here we show that quality control of translation of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)-localized mRNA intersects with the turnover of damaged mitochondria, both orchestrated by the mitochondrial kinase PINK1. Mitochondrial damage causes stalled translation of complex-I 30 kDa subunit (C-I30) mRNA on MOM, triggering the recruitment of co-translational quality control factors Pelo, ABCE1, and NOT4 to the ribosome/mRNA-ribonucleoprotein complex. Damage-induced ubiquitination of ABCE1 by NOT4 generates poly-ubiquitin signals that attract autophagy receptors to MOM to initiate mitophagy. In the Drosophila PINK1 model, these factors act synergistically to restore mitophagy and neuromuscular tissue integrity. Thus ribosome-associated co-translational quality control generates an early signal to trigger mitophagy. Our results have broad therapeutic implications for the understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
We used local field potentials (LFPs) and spikes to investigate representations of visual space in prefrontal cortex and the dynamics of those representations during eye movements. Spatial information contained in LFPs of the frontal eye field (FEF) was differentially distributed across frequencies, with a majority of that information being carried in alpha and high-gamma bands and minimal signal in the low-gamma band. During fixation, spatial information from alpha and high-gamma bands and spiking activity was robust across cortical layers. Receptive fields (RFs) derived from alpha and high-gamma bands were retinocentrically organized, and they were spatially correlated both with each other and with spiking RFs. However, alpha and high-gamma RFs probed before eye movements were dissociated. Whereas high-gamma and spiking RFs immediately converged toward the movement goal, alpha RFs remained largely unchanged during the initial probe response, but they converged later. These observations reveal possible mechanisms of dynamic spatial representations that underlie visual perception during eye movements.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation is a critical step in gene regulation. Here, we report that U1 snRNP recognition and transcription pausing at stable nucleosomes are linked through premature polyadenylation signal (PAS) termination. By generating RNA exosome conditional deletion mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified a large class of polyadenylated short transcripts in the sense direction destabilized by the RNA exosome. These PAS termination events are enriched at the first few stable nucleosomes flanking CpG islands and suppressed by U1 snRNP. Thus, promoter-proximal Pol II pausing consists of two processes: TSS-proximal and +1 stable nucleosome pausing, with PAS termination coinciding with the latter. While pausing factors NELF/DSIF only function in the former step, flavopiridol-sensitive mechanism(s) and Myc modulate both steps. We propose that premature PAS termination near the nucleosome-associated pause site represents a common transcriptional elongation checkpoint regulated by U1 snRNP recognition, nucleosome stability, and Myc activity.

Abstract: Summary
The proteolysis-assisted protein quality control system guards the proteome from potentially detrimental aberrant proteins. How miscellaneous defective proteins are specifically eliminated and which molecular characteristics direct them for removal are fundamental questions. We reveal a mechanism, DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons), by which CRL2 ubiquitin ligase uses interchangeable substrate receptors to recognize the unusual C termini of abnormal proteins (i.e., C-end degrons). C-end degrons are mostly less than ten residues in length and comprise a few indispensable residues along with some rather degenerate ones. The C-terminal end position is essential for C-end degron function. Truncated selenoproteins generated by translation errors and the USP1 N-terminal fragment from post-translational cleavage are eliminated by DesCEND. DesCEND also targets full-length proteins with naturally occurring C-end degrons. The C-end degron in DesCEND echoes the N-end degron in the N-end rule pathway, highlighting the dominance of protein “ends” as indicators for protein elimination.

Abstract: Summary
Developmentally regulated accessory subunits dictate PRC2 function. Here, we report the crystal structures of a 120 kDa heterotetrameric complex consisting of Suz12, Rbbp4, Jarid2, and Aebp2 fragments that is minimally active in nucleosome binding and of an inactive binary complex of Suz12 and Rbbp4. Suz12 contains two unique structural platforms that define distinct classes of PRC2 holo complexes for chromatin binding. Aebp2 and Phf19 compete for binding of a non-canonical C2 domain of Suz12; Jarid2 and EPOP occupy an overlapped Suz12 surface required for chromatin association of PRC2. Suz12 and Aebp2 progressively block histone H3K4 binding to Rbbp4, suggesting that Rbbp4 may not be directly involved in PRC2 inhibition by the active H3K4me3 histone mark. Nucleosome binding enabled by Jarid2 and Aebp2 is in part accounted for by the structures, which also reveal that disruption of the Jarid2-Suz12 interaction may underlie the disease mechanism of an oncogenic chromosomal translocation of Suz12.
