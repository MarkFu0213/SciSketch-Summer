Abstract: Autophagy has been reported to have a pivotal role in maintaining stemness, regulating immunomodulation and enhancing the survival of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the effect of autophagy on MSC metabolism is largely unknown. Here, we report a workflow for examining the impact of autophagy on human placenta-derived MSC (hPMSC) metabolome profiling with chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC−MS. Rapamycin or 3-methyladenine was successfully used to induce or inhibit autophagy, respectively. Then, 12C- and 13C-dansylation labeling LC−MS were used to profile the amine/phenol submetabolome. A total of 935 peak pairs were detected and 50 metabolites were positively identified using the dansylation metabolite standards library, and 669 metabolites were putatively identified based on an accurate mass match in metabolome databases. 12C/13C-p-dimethylaminophenacyl bromide labeling LC−MS was used to analyze the carboxylic acid submetabolome; 4736 peak pairs were detected, among which 33 metabolites were positively identified in the dimethylaminophenacyl metabolite standards library, and 3007 metabolites were putatively identified. PCA/OPLS-DA analysis combined with volcano plots and Venn diagrams was used to determine the significant metabolites. Metabolites pathway analysis demonstrated that hPMSCs appeared to generate more ornithine with the arginine and proline metabolism pathway and utilized more pantothenic acid to synthesize acetyl-CoA in the beta-alanine metabolism pathway when autophagy was activated. Meanwhile, acetyl-CoA conversion to fatty acids led to accumulation in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. In contrast, when autophagy was suppressed, a reduction in metabolites demonstrated weakened metabolic activity in these metabolic pathways. Our research provides a more comprehensive understanding of hPMSC metabolism associated with autophagy.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in maintenance of proteostasis through the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is strongly activated in most neurodegenerative disorders. UPR signalling pathways mediated by IRE1α and ATF6 play a crucial role in the maintenance of ER homeostasis through the transactivation of an array of transcription factors. When activated, these transcription factors induce the expression of genes involved in protein folding and degradation with pro-survival effects. However, the specific contribution of these transcription factors to different neurodegenerative diseases remains poorly defined. Here, we characterised 44 target genes strongly influenced by XBP1 and ATF6 and quantified the expression of a subset of genes in the human post-mortem spinal cord from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases and in the frontal and temporal cortex from frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cases and controls. We found that IRE1α-XBP1 and ATF6 pathways were strongly activated both in ALS and AD. In ALS, XBP1 and ATF6 activation was confirmed by a substantial increase in the expression of both known and novel target genes involved particularly in co-chaperone activity and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) such as DNAJB9, SEL1L and OS9. In AD cases, a distinct pattern emerged, where targets involved in protein folding were more prominent, such as CANX, PDIA3 and PDIA6. These results reveal that both overlapping and disease-specific patterns of IRE1α-XBP1 and ATF6 target genes are activated in AD and ALS, which may be relevant to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Graphical abstractThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in maintenance of proteostasis through the unfolded protein response (UPR). Two major UPR signalling pathways are mediated by IRE1α and ATF6. Here, we demonstrate that these pathways activate differential gene sets in human post-mortem tissues derived from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) compared to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cases. Our results identify IRE1α and ATF6 specific targets that can have major implications in the development of new therapeutic strategies and potential biomarkers.Graphical abstract

Abstract: MicroRNA-98(miR-98) has been shown to be critical for tumorigenesis, however its involvement in bladder cancer are unclear. The present study aims to investigate the expression, biological roles and potential mechanisms of miR-98 in human bladder cancer. We found that miR-98 was upregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. In addition, miR-98 expression was higher in bladder cancer cell lines than in uroepithelial cell line SV-HUC-1. Functional studies revealed that miR-98 mimic promoted proliferation of T24 cells while miR-98 inhibitor inhibited proliferation of BIU-87 cells. Moreover, miR-98 mimic increased cisplatin/doxorubicin resistance and inhibited apoptosis in T24 cells, while miR-98 inhibitor decreased chemoresistance and facilitated apoptosis in BIU-87 cells. Further experiments using MitoTracker and JC-1 staining showed that miR-98 could regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion balance and mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blot showed that miR-98 upregulated cyclin D1, p-Drp1 and Drp1. Using luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that LASS2 acted as a direct target of miR-98. LASS2 overexpression induced mitochondrial fusion and downregulated mitochondrial potential, with decreased p-Drp1 status. Additionally, LASS2 siRNA abrogated the effects of miR-98 mimic on Drp1phosphorylation and chemoresistance. We also found a negative correlation between LASS2 and miR-98 in bladder cancer tissues. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-98 targets LASS2 and regulates bladder cancer chemoresistance through modulation of mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) is an adhesion receptor in desmosomes, but its role in carcinoma cell migration and invasion is mostly unknown. Our aim was to quantitatively analyse the motion of Dsg3-modified carcinoma cells in 2D settings and in 3D within tumour microenvironment mimicking (TMEM) matrices. We tested mutant constructs of C-terminally truncated Dsg3 (∆238 and ∆560), overexpressed full-length (FL) Dsg3, and empty vector control (Ct) of buccal mucosa squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC/Y1) cells. We captured live cell images and analysed migration velocities and accumulated and Euclidean distances. We compared rodent collagen and Matrigel® with human Myogel TMEM matrices for these parameters in 3D sandwich, in which we also tested the effects of monoclonal antibody AK23, which targets the EC1 domain of Dsg3. In monolayer culture, FL and both truncated constructs migrated faster and had higher accumulated distances than Ct cells. However, in the 3D assays, only the mutants invaded faster relative to Ct cells. Of the mutants, the shorter form (Δ238) exhibited faster migration and invasion than Δ560 cells. In the Transwell, all of the cells invaded faster through Myogel than Matrigel® coated wells. In 3D sandwich, AK23 antibody inhibited only the invasion of FL cells. We conclude that different experimental 2D and 3D settings can markedly influence the movement of oral carcinoma cells with various Dsg3 modifications.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiomyocytes (CMs) generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are under investigation for their suitability as human models in preclinical drug development. Antiarrhythmic drug development focuses on atrial biology for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Here we used recent retinoic acid-based protocols to generate atrial CMs from hiPSCs and establish right atrial engineered heart tissue (RA-EHT) as a 3D model of human atrium. EHT from standard protocol-derived hiPSC-CMs (Ctrl-EHT) and intact human muscle strips served as comparators. RA-EHT exhibited higher mRNA and protein concentrations of atrial-selective markers, faster contraction kinetics, lower force generation, shorter action potential duration, and higher repolarization fraction than Ctrl-EHTs. In addition, RA-EHTs but not Ctrl-EHTs responded to pharmacological manipulation of atrial-selective potassium currents. RA- and Ctrl-EHTs’ behavior reflected differences between human atrial and ventricular muscle preparations. Taken together, RA-EHT is a model of human atrium that may be useful in preclinical drug screening.

Abstract: Summary
The post-translational modification (PTM) and signaling molecule poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) has an impact on diverse biological processes. This PTM is regulated by a series of ADP-ribosyl glycohydrolases (PARG enzymes) that cleave polymers and/or liberate monomers from their protein targets. Existing methods for monitoring these hydrolases rely on detection of the natural substrate, PAR, commonly achieved via radioisotopic labeling. Here we disclose a general substrate for monitoring PARG activity, TFMU-ADPr, which directly reports on total PAR hydrolase activity via release of a fluorophore; this substrate has excellent reactivity, generality (processed by the major PARG enzymes), stability, and usability. A second substrate, TFMU-IDPr, selectively reports on PARG activity only from the enzyme ARH3. Use of these probes in whole-cell lysate experiments has revealed a mechanism by which ARH3 is inhibited by cholera toxin. TFMU-ADPr and TFMU-IDPr are versatile tools for assessing small-molecule inhibitors in vitro and probing the regulation of ADP-ribosyl catabolic enzymes.

Abstract: Chemotherapy remains the most prescribed anti-cancer therapy, despite patients suffering severe side effects and frequently developing chemoresistance. These complications can be partially overcome by combining different chemotherapeutic agents that target multiple biological pathways. However, selecting efficacious drug combinations remains challenging. We previously used fission yeast Schizosaccharomycespombe as a surrogate model to predict drug combinations, and showed that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and cisplatin can sensitise gastric adenocarcinoma cells toward the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin. Yet, how this combination undermines cell viability is unknown. Here, we show that SAHA and doxorubicin markedly enhance the cleavage of two apoptosis markers, caspase 3 and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP-1), and increase the phosphorylation of γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage. Further, we found a prominent reduction in Ser485 phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), and reductions in its target mTOR and downstream ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation. We show that SAHA contributes most of the effect, as confirmed using another histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A. Overall, our results show that the combination of SAHA and doxorubicin can induce apoptosis in gastric adenocarcinoma in a synthetically lethal manner, and that fission yeast offers an efficient tool for identifying potent drug combinations against human cancer cells.

Abstract: During spermatogenesis, a group of undifferentiated spermatogonia undergoes an essential transition to a differentiating stage, which involves gain of Kit receptor. In the current study, we showed that a small non-coding RNA, miRNA-26b could induce transition from Kit- to Kit+ and inhibit proliferation of spermatogonia. A key transcriptional factor for undifferentiated spermatogonia, Plzf, was proven as a direct target of miR-26b. When undifferentiated spermatogonia were treated with Retinoic acid (RA), miR-26b was increased, further promoting RA-induced differentiation of spermatogonia. In addition, miR-26b could repress 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) via repression of Tet3 in spermatogonia. These findings demonstrate that miR-26b might play a role in promoting the transition from Kit- to Kit+ SSCs.

Abstract: Oral diseases, such as periapical periodontitis and periodontitis, are characterized by inflammation-induced bone loss. LL-37, a human antimicrobial peptide (AMP), has multiple biological functions and the potential to promote osteogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of LL-37 within normal and inflammatory microenvironments. The roles of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were also demonstrated. The results showed that LL-37 promoted bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation. LL-37 inhibited the expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) at both protein and gene levels, and attenuated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inhibition of osteogenesis. Immunofluorescence (IF) confirmed P2X7R expression in BMSCs. BBG, a P2X7R antagonist, significantly attenuated LL-37-promoted osteogenesis. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) increased after LL-37 stimulation, which did not affect p38 phosphorylation. The effects of LL-37 on osteogenesis-related gene expression were markedly attenuated by selective inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK. Furthermore, a mouse model of LPS-stimulated calvarial osteolysis was established, and results showed that LL-37 markedly inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption. In conclusion, we speculate that LL-37 inhibits inflammation and promotes BMSC osteogenesis via P2X7R and MAPK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexan parasites rely on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases for host cell infection, yet the mechanisms that control their activation remain unknown. Here we show that an apically localized guanylate cyclase (GC) controls microneme secretion and lytic growth in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. Cell-permeable cGMP reversed the block in microneme secretion seen in a knockdown of TgGC, linking its function to production of cGMP. TgGC possesses an N-terminal P-type ATPase domain fused to a C-terminal heterodimeric guanylate cyclase domain, an architecture found only in Apicomplexa and related protists. Complementation with a panel of mutants revealed a critical requirement for the P-type ATPase domain for maximum GC function. We further demonstrate that knockdown of TgGC in vivo protects mice from lethal infection by blocking parasite expansion and dissemination. Collectively, this work demonstrates that cGMP-mediated signaling in Toxoplasma relies on a multi-domain architecture, which may serve a conserved role in related parasites.

Abstract: Summary
In this study we developed an efficient method to prepare glycoengineered β-N-acetylhexosaminidase containing multiple mannose-6-phosphates (M6Ps) by combining genetic code expansion with bioorthogonal ligation techniques. We found that multiple M6P-conjugated enzymes were produced with a high efficiency by using combined techniques. Importantly, glycoengineered enzymes entered lysosomes of patient-derived primary cells, which lack endogenous lysosomal β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, more readily than commercialized human β-hexosaminidase. Moreover, glycoengineered enzymes successfully removed GM2-ganglioside stored in lysosomes of diseased cells, indicating that its activity is restored in diseased cells. We also synthesized and applied a lysosome-targeting fluorogenic substrate to monitor endogenous and supplemental glycoengineered β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activities in lysosomes. The results of this study indicate that the present strategy, which relies on genetic code expansion and bioorthogonal ligation techniques, is highly attractive to generate multi-M6P-containing lysosomal enzymes that can be used to study lysosomal storage disorders associated with lysosomal enzyme deficiencies.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic decoys are synthetic analogs of naturally occurring biosynthetic acceptors. These compounds divert cellular biosynthetic pathways by acting as artificial substrates that usurp the activity of natural enzymes. While O-linked glycosides are common, they are only partially effective even at millimolar concentrations. In contrast, we report that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) incorporated into various thioglycosides robustly truncate cell surface N- and O-linked glycan biosynthesis at 10–100 μM concentrations. The >10-fold greater inhibition is in part due to the resistance of thioglycosides to hydrolysis by intracellular hexosaminidases. The thioglycosides reduce β-galactose incorporation into lactosamine chains, cell surface sialyl Lewis-X expression, and leukocyte rolling on selectin substrates including inflamed endothelial cells under fluid shear. Treatment of granulocytes with thioglycosides prior to infusion into mouse inhibited neutrophil homing to sites of acute inflammation and bone marrow by ∼80%–90%. Overall, thioglycosides represent an easy to synthesize class of efficient metabolic inhibitors or decoys. They reduce N-/O-linked glycan biosynthesis and inflammatory leukocyte accumulation.

Abstract: Summary
In the mammalian gut, bacteria compete for resources to maintain their populations, but the factors determining their success are poorly understood. We report that the human gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron relies on the stringent response, an intracellular signaling pathway that allocates resources away from growth, to survive carbon starvation and persist in the gut. Genome-scale transcriptomics, 13C-labeling, and metabolomics analyses reveal that B. thetaiotaomicron uses the alarmone (p)ppGpp to repress multiple biosynthetic pathways and upregulate tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle genes in these conditions. During carbon starvation, (p)ppGpp triggers accumulation of the metabolite alpha-ketoglutarate, which itself acts as a metabolic regulator; alpha-ketoglutarate supplementation restores viability to a (p)ppGpp-deficient strain. These studies uncover how commensal bacteria adapt to the gut by modulating central metabolism and reveal that halting rather than accelerating growth can be a determining factor for membership in the gut microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reportedly exist in a vascular niche occupying the outer adventitial layer. However, these cells have not been well characterized in vivo in medium- and large-sized arteries in humans, and their potential pathological role is unknown. To address this, healthy and diseased arterial tissues were obtained as surplus surgical specimens and freshly processed. We identified that CD90 marks a rare adventitial population that co-expresses MSC markers including PDGFRα, CD44, CD73, and CD105. However, unlike CD90, these additional markers were widely expressed by other cells. Human adventitial CD90+ cells fulfilled standard MSC criteria, including plastic adherence, spindle morphology, passage ability, colony formation, and differentiation into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. Phenotypic and transcriptomic profiling, as well as adoptive transfer experiments, revealed a potential role in vascular disease pathogenesis, with the transcriptomic disease signature of these cells being represented in an aortic regulatory gene network that is operative in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: The forkhead transcription factor, Foxp3, has been proved essential for differentiation and activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Recently, Foxp3 expression in tumor cells (cancer cell-derived Foxp3) has gained increasing interest, but the function has yet to be confirmed. In the current investigation, we identified the interaction of cancer cell-derived Foxp3 and tumor microenvironment in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma(TSCC) by various in vitro methods. We detected cancer cell-derived Foxp3 was closely associated with the infiltration of Foxp3 + lymphocytes in TSCC lesions using immunohistochemical staining. The cytokines secretion (IFN-γ, TGFβ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-8, IL-17, IL-23) of PBMC and differentiation of CD4 +T cells were modulated by the expression of Foxp3 in TSCC, shown by ELISA and flow cytometry. As feedback, increasing TGFβ and decreasing IL-17 further up-regulated cancer cell-derived Foxp3. Furthermore, CHIP on chip assay showed that both TGFβ and IL-17 decreased the number of Foxp3-binding genes in TSCC. GO and pathway analysis suggested that, treated with TGFβ or Th17, Foxp3-binding genes were inclined to the negative regulation of TGFβ signal pathway. Taken together, this study showed cancer cell-derived Foxp3 contributed to Tregs expansion in TSCC microenvironment with positive and negative feedbacks.

We now find that the capsid of the systemically replicating MNV strain CW3 promotes lytic cell death, release of interleukin-1α, and increased inflammatory cytokine release. Correspondingly, inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils are recruited to sites of infection in a CW3-capsid-dependent manner. Recruited monocytes and neutrophils are subsequently infected, representing a majority of infected cells in vivo. Systemic depletion of inflammatory monocytes or neutrophils from persistently infected Rag1−/− mice reduces viral titers in a tissue-specific manner. These data indicate that the CW3 capsid facilitates lytic cell death, inflammation, and recruitment of susceptible cells to promote persistence. Infection of continuously recruited inflammatory cells may be a mechanism of persistence broadly utilized by lytic viruses incapable of establishing latency.

Abstract: Diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) are a family of enzymes catalyzing the transformation of diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid, which have been recognized as key regulators in cell signaling pathways. The role of DGKγ in human malignancies has seldom been studied. In this study, we investigated the role of DGKγ in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that DGKγ was down-regulated in HCC tumor tissues and cell lines as compared to that in non-tumor tissues. The prognostic value of DGKγ expression was evaluated by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Lower DGKγ expression in tumor tissues was an independent prognostic factor for poor post-surgical overall survival. By using HDACs inhibitors treatment and ChIP-PCR, we discovered that histone H3 and H4 deacetylation mainly contributed to the downregulation of DGKγ expression. Functional studies revealed that ectopic expression of DGKγ inhibited cell proliferation and cell migration in HCC cells. Mechanism studies showed that DGKγ overexpression led to down regulation of GLUT1 protein level and AMPK activity, which result in glucose uptake suppression as well as lactate and ATP production declination. The decrease of GLUT1 level could be partially rescued by treatments with either DGK inhibitor and lysosome inhibitor, indicating DGKγ may down-regulate GLUT1 through its kinase activity and lysosome degradation process. Together, this study demonstrated that DGKγ plays a tumor suppressor role in HCC by negatively regulating GLUT1. DGKγ could be a novel prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic bacteria taken up into the macrophage phagosome are the target of many anti-microbial mechanisms. Although mitochondria-derived antimicrobial effectors like reactive oxygen species (mROS) aid in bacterial killing, it is unclear how these effectors reach bacteria within the phagosomal lumen. We show here that endoplasmic reticulum stress triggered upon methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection induces mROS that are delivered to bacteria-containing phagosomes via mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs). The endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1α induces mROS, specifically hydrogen peroxide (mH2O2), upon MRSA infection. MRSA infection also stimulates the generation of MDVs, which require the mitochondrial stress response factor Parkin, and contributes to mH2O2 accumulation in bacteria-containing phagosomes. Accumulation of phagosomal H2O2 requires Toll-like receptor signaling and the mitochondrial enzyme superoxide dismutase-2 (Sod2), which is delivered to phagosomes by MDVs. Sod2 depletion compromises mH2O2 production and bacterial killing. Thus, mitochondrial redox capacity enhances macrophage antimicrobial function by delivering mitochondria-derived effector molecules into bacteria-containing phagosomes.

Abstract: Trio, the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF), plays diverse roles in cell migration, cell axon guidance and cytoskeleton reorganization. Conserved during evolution, Trio encodes two guanine nucleotide exchange factor domains (GEFs) and activates small GTPases. The Rho-family small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, which are target molecules of Trio, have been described to engage in craniofacial development and tooth formation. However, the exact role of Trio in tooth development remains elusive. In this study, we generated Wnt1-cre;Triofl/fl mice to address the potential function of Trio in tooth development. Wnt1-cre;Triofl/fl mice showed short root deformity as well as decreased expression of odontogenic makers such as RUNX2, OSX, OCN, and OPN. In vitro, Trio was silenced in human stem cells of dental papilla (SCAPs). Compared with the control group, the proliferation and migration ability in the experimental group was disrupted. After knocking down Trio in SCAPs, the cells showed phenotypes of poor odontogenic differentiation and weak mineralized nodules. To study the underlying mechanism, we investigated the p38 MAPK pathway and found that loss of Trio blocked the cascade transduction of p38 MAPK signaling. In conclusion, we identified Trio as a novel coordinator in regulating root development and clarified its relevant molecular events.

Abstract: Summary
In enteric viral infections, such as those with rotavirus and norovirus, individual viral particles shed in stool are considered the optimal units of fecal-oral transmission. We reveal that rotaviruses and noroviruses are also shed in stool as viral clusters enclosed within vesicles that deliver a high inoculum to the receiving host. Cultured cells non-lytically release rotaviruses and noroviruses inside extracellular vesicles. In addition, stools of infected hosts contain norovirus and rotavirus within vesicles of exosomal or plasma membrane origin. These vesicles remain intact during fecal-oral transmission and thereby transport multiple viral particles collectively to the next host, enhancing both the MOI and disease severity. Vesicle-cloaked viruses are non-negligible populations in stool and have a disproportionately larger contribution to infectivity than free viruses. Our findings indicate that vesicle-cloaked viruses are highly virulent units of fecal-oral transmission and highlight a need for antivirals targeting vesicles and virus clustering.

Abstract: Neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) are important for nerve regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). Their proliferation, however, is limited. In this study, we investigated the role of Notch1 signaling in NSPC proliferation using adult mouse spinal cord derived NSPCs. We observed that Notch1 promoted proliferation of NSPCs and that Notch1 overexpression led to an expansion of cells in the S-phase and increased cyclin D1 expression. When investigating the functional relationship between Notch1, p-p38 and Pax6, we found that Notch1 suppressed p-p38 while promoting Pax6 expression. Functional inhibition of p38 with SB202190 led to increased Pax6 expression and to proliferation, as determined by BrdU. Furthermore, we confirmed that Pax6 induced proliferation in adult mouse spinal cord derived NSPCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Notch1 promotes the proliferation of mouse spinal NSPCs via a p-p38-pax6-cyclin D1 signaling pathway. This pathway constitutes a promising new therapeutic target for SCI treatment.

Abstract: Sharks have maintained a key role in marine food webs for 400 million years and across varying physicochemical contexts, suggesting plasticity to environmental change. In this study, we investigated the biochemical effects of ocean acidification (OA) levels predicted for 2100 (pCO2 ~ 900 μatm) on newly hatched tropical whitespotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum). Specifically, we measured lipid, protein, and DNA damage levels, as well as changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic ROS scavengers in juvenile sharks exposed to elevated CO2 for 50 days following hatching. Moreover, we also assessed the secondary oxidative stress response, i.e., heat shock response and ubiquitin levels. Newly hatched sharks appear to cope with OA-related stress through a range of tissue-specific biochemical strategies, specifically through the action of antioxidant enzymatic compounds. Our findings suggest that ROS-scavenging molecules, rather than complex enzymatic proteins, provide an effective defense mechanism in dealing with OA-elicited ROS formation. We argue that sharks’ ancient antioxidant system, strongly based on non-enzymatic antioxidants (e.g., urea), may provide them with resilience towards OA, potentially beyond the tolerance of more recently evolved species, i.e., teleosts. Nevertheless, previous research has provided evidence of detrimental effects of OA (interacting with other climate-related stressors) on some aspects of shark biology. Moreover, given that long-term acclimation and adaptive potential to rapid environmental changes are yet experimentally unaccounted for, future research is warranted to accurately predict shark physiological performance under future ocean conditions.

Abstract: Diapause is an important strategy for certain insect species to survive unfavorable environmental conditions, including low temperatures experienced when they overwinter in cold climate. Many studies have indicated that the increased expression of heat shock proteins during diapause improves the thermal tolerance of insects. However, the relationship between small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and diapause is not clear or well-researched. In this study, we investigated the transcript levels of 14 sHSP genes in the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, a major pest of spruce and fir in Canada, during pre-diapause, diapause, and post-diapause under normal rearing conditions and in response to a heat shock treatment. We found that sHSP expression profiles could be classified into five patterns under normal laboratory conditions: pattern I was upregulated only during pre-diapause, pattern II was upregulated only during diapause, pattern III was constantly expressed throughout diapause, pattern IV was upregulated in both pre-diapause and diapause, and pattern V was upregulated only during post-diapause. After heat shock, five different expression patterns were observed: pattern I responded weakly or not at all throughout diapause, pattern II responded weakly during the diapause stage but strongly at the onset of diapause and in the post-diapause period, pattern III was upregulated only during post-diapause, pattern IV was strongest during diapause, and pattern V was strongest only in early diapause. These complex expression profiles lead us to suggest that most of the sHSP genes are involved in the diapause process and that they may have multiple and important roles in different phases of this process.

Abstract: Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a subclass of noncoding RNA from enhancers, have biological functions in gene expression. However, their potential role in bladder cancer (BCa) remains largely unknown. The present study investigated the functional role of androgen-associated androgen receptor (AR) mediated-eRNA MARC1 (eMARC1) in BCa progression. Cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of BCa cell lines (5637 and T24) with different eMARC1 expression levels or treated with 5α-dehydrotestosterone (DHT) were investigated. In the current study, we discovered that eMARC1 was highly expressed in BCa tissues and cell lines, and eMARC1 overexpression promoted the progression of BCa cells, while knockdown of eMARC1 suppressed tumorigenesis. DHT treatment significantly elevated eMARC1 expression levels, which also facilitated cell proliferation, motility, and inhibited cell apoptosis. We further found that eMARC1 silencing impaired the androgenic effect of DHT in BCa cells. These results suggested that eMARC1 exerted its effects on BCa cell progression, and DHT promoted bladder cancer progression by activating eMARC1.

Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) prevents endothelial cells damage and P-selectin of platelets promotes neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) formation. However, how sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a donor that produces H2S regulates the activation of platelets and whether H2S inhibits the formation of neutrophils extracellular traps in hyperhomocysteinemia rats have not been previously investigated. The morphological and ultrastructural alterations of endothelial cells (ECs) and platelets were tested by transmission electron microscopy. The expressions of P-selectin of platelets were determined by flow cytometry. Additionally, the cellular ROS and the H2S level were detected by DCFH-DA staining and H2S probe, the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 in arteries and cultured ECs from rat thoracic aortas and the phosphor-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), CSE and CBS of platelets were measured by western blotting. The NETs formations, the concentration of DNA in serum and supernatant of cultured neutrophils stimulated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were tested by Sytox Green and PicoGreen commercial Kits. The vascular ECs damaged, the expression of P-selectin of platelets and NETs formation increased; the concentration of DNA in serum and supernatant of cultured neutrophils stimulated with PRP also increased; the expression of Bax increased while Bcl-2 decreased in arteries, the phosphor-p38 MAPK of platelets increased while CSE and CBS have no statistically significant changes in the HHcy group compared to the control group. In the cultured ECs, the ROS level increased while the H2S level decreased after 48 and 72 h treatment by HHcy; the expression of Bcl-2 decreased while Bax increased after 72 h treatment by HHcy. NaHS significantly inhibited the ECs injured, cellular ROS production, platelet activation and NETs formation, reversed the expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, phosphor-p38 MAPK, P-selectin and the increased concentration of DNA in serum and supernatant of cultured neutrophils which caused by high homocysteine. Our results demonstrate that the donor of H2S inhibits the platelets activation and NETs formation, which concerts the protection of ECs in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Abstract: Encysted embryos of Artemia are among the most stress-resistant eukaryotes partly due to the massive amount of a cysteine-rich protein termed artemin. High number of cysteine residues in artemin and their intramolecular spatial positions motivated us to investigate the role of the cysteine residues in the chaperone-like activity of artemin. According to the result of Ellman’s assay, there are nine free thiols (seven buried and two exposed) and one disulfide bond per monomer of artemin. Subsequent theoretical analysis of the predicted 3D structure of artemin confirmed the data obtained by the spectroscopic study. Native and reduced/modified forms of artemin were also compared with respect to their efficiency in chaperoning activity, tertiary structure, and stability. Since the alkylation and reduction of artemin diminished its chaperone activity, it appears that its chaperoning potential depends on the formation of intermolecular disulfide bond and the presence of cysteine residues. Comparative fluorescence studies on the structure and stability of the native and reduced protein revealed some differences between them. Due to the redox-dependent functional switching of artemin from the less to more active form, it can be finally suggested as a redox-dependent chaperone.

Abstract: Summary
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a fatal X-linked disorder caused by loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes and consequent hypomyelination. The underlying cellular and molecular dysfunctions are not fully defined, but therapeutic enhancement of oligodendrocyte survival could restore functional myelination in patients. Here we generated pure, scalable quantities of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from a severe mouse model of PMD, Plp1jimpy. Temporal phenotypic and transcriptomic studies defined an early pathological window characterized by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death as OPCs exit their progenitor state. High-throughput phenotypic screening identified a compound, Ro 25–6981, which modulates the ER stress response and rescues mutant oligodendrocyte survival in jimpy, in vitro and in vivo, and in human PMD oligocortical spheroids. Surprisingly, increasing oligodendrocyte survival did not restore subsequent myelination, revealing a second pathological phase. Collectively, our work shows that PMD oligodendrocyte loss can be rescued pharmacologically and defines a need for multifactorial intervention to restore myelination.

Abstract: Summary
The human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) research landscape is rapidly evolving. To assess possible novel trends in hPSC usage, we analyzed experimental hPSC research published from 2014 to 2016 and compared our data with those of earlier periods. The number of papers describing experimental work involving hPSCs increased further with clear differences in the scientific impact of publications from different countries. Our results confirm the leading position of US-based hPSC research, although to a lesser degree than observed previously. Our data reveal that research into human induced pluripotent stem cells alone surpassed human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research by 2015 and rapidly grew after that. We also report on continuing and even slightly growing research activities in the hESC field as well as on a generally declining rate of the generation of new hESC lines. An increasing portion of new hESC lines represents disease-specific and clinical-grade cell lines. The previously noted usage of only a few early established hESC lines in the vast majority of scientific work is sustained. We also provide a comprehensive overview on clinical trials on the basis of hPSCs. We find that the vast majority of those trials are based on hESC-derived cell products that were generated from an only limited number of relatively old cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
Defective endometrial stromal fibroblasts (EMSFs) contribute to uterine factor infertility, endometriosis, and endometrial cancer. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from skin or bone marrow biopsies provide a patient-specific source that can be differentiated to various cells types. Replacement of abnormal EMSFs is a potential novel therapeutic approach for endometrial disease; however, the methodology or mechanism for differentiating iPSCs to EMSFs is unknown. The uterus differentiates from the intermediate mesoderm (IM) to form coelomic epithelium (CE) followed by the Müllerian duct (MD). Here, we successfully directed the differentiation of human iPSCs (hiPSCs) through IM, CE, and MD to EMSFs under molecularly defined embryoid body culture conditions using specific hormonal treatments. Activation of CTNNB1 was essential for expression of progesterone receptor that mediated the final differentiation step of EMSFs before implantation. These hiPSC-derived tissues illustrate the potential for iPSC-based endometrial regeneration for future cell-based treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Predicting developmental potency and risk of posttransplantation tumor formation by human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and their derivatives largely rely on classical histological analysis of teratomas. Here, we investigated whether an assay based on microRNAs (miRNA) in blood plasma is able to detect potentially malignant elements. Several hPSCs and human malignant germ cell tumor (hGCT) lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo after mouse xenografting. The multiple conventional hPSC lines generated mature teratomas, while xenografts from induced hPSCs (hiPSCs) with reactivated reprogramming transgenes and hGCT lines contained undifferentiated and potentially malignant components. The presence of these elements was reflected in the mRNA and miRNA profiles of the xenografts with OCT3/4 mRNA and the miR-371 and miR-302 families readily detectable. miR-371 family members were also identified in mouse plasma faithfully reporting undifferentiated elements in the xenografts. This study demonstrated that undifferentiated and potentially malignant cells could be detected in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The in vivo niche and basic cellular properties of nephron progenitors are poorly described. Here we studied the cellular organization and function of the MAPK/ERK pathway in nephron progenitors. Live-imaging of ERK activity by a Förster resonance energy transfer biosensor revealed a dynamic activation pattern in progenitors, whereas differentiating precursors exhibited sustained activity. Genetic experiments demonstrate that MAPK/ERK activity controls the thickness, coherence, and integrity of the nephron progenitor niche. Molecularly, MAPK/ERK activity regulates niche organization and communication with extracellular matrix through PAX2 and ITGA8, and is needed for CITED1 expression denoting undifferentiated status. MAPK/ERK activation in nephron precursors propels differentiation by priming cells for distal and proximal fates induced by the Wnt and Notch pathways. Thus, our results demonstrate a mechanism through which MAPK/ERK activity controls both progenitor maintenance and differentiation by regulating a distinct set of targets, which maintain the biomechanical milieu of tissue-residing progenitors and prime precursors for nephrogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota can be altered by dietary interventions to prevent and treat various diseases. However, the mechanisms by which food products modulate commensals remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) are taken up by the gut microbiota and contain RNAs that alter microbiome composition and host physiology. Ginger ELNs (GELNs) are preferentially taken up by Lactobacillaceae in a GELN lipid-dependent manner and contain microRNAs that target various genes in Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG). Among these, GELN mdo-miR7267-3p-mediated targeting of the LGG monooxygenase ycnE yields increased indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3A). GELN-RNAs or I3A, a ligand for aryl hydrocarbon receptor, are sufficient to induce production of IL-22, which is linked to barrier function improvement. These functions of GELN-RNAs can ameliorate mouse colitis via IL-22-dependent mechanisms. These findings reveal how plant products and their effects on the microbiome may be used to target specific host processes to alleviate disease.

Abstract: Summary
During sepsis, small blood vessels can become occluded by large platelet aggregates of poorly understood etiology. During Staphylococcal aureus infection, sepsis severity is linked to the bacterial α-toxin (α-hemolysin, AT) through unclear mechanisms. In this study, we visualized intravascular events in the microcirculation and found that intravenous AT injection induces rapid platelet aggregation, forming dynamic micro-thrombi in the microcirculation. These aggregates are retained in the liver sinusoids and kidney glomeruli, causing multi-organ dysfunction. Acute staphylococcal infection results in sequestration of most bacteria by liver macrophages. Platelets are initially recruited to these macrophages and help eradicate S. aureus. However, at later time points, AT causes aberrant and damaging thrombosis throughout the liver. Treatment with an AT neutralizing antibody (MEDI4893∗) prevents platelet aggregation and subsequent liver damage, without affecting the initial and beneficial platelet recruitment. Thus, AT neutralization may represent a promising approach to combat staphylococcal-induced intravascular coagulation and organ dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of mutations that confer resistance to molecularly targeted therapeutics is dependent upon the effect of each mutation on drug affinity for the target protein, the clonal fitness of cells harboring the mutation, and the probability that each variant can be generated by DNA codon base mutation. We present a computational workflow that combines these three factors to identify mutations likely to arise upon drug treatment in a particular tumor type. The Osprey-based workflow is validated using a comprehensive dataset of ERK2 mutations and is applied to small-molecule drugs and/or therapeutic antibodies targeting KIT, EGFR, Abl, and ALK. We identify major clinically observed drug-resistant mutations for drug-target pairs and highlight the potential to prospectively identify probable drug resistance mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Alternatives to antibiotics for preventing diarrhea in early-weaned farm animals are sorely needed. CM piglets (a native Chinese breed) are more resistant to early-weaning stress-induced diarrhea than the commercial crossbred LY piglets. Transferring fecal microbiota, but not saline, from healthy CM into LY piglets by oral administration prior to early weaning conferred diarrhea resistance. By comparing the relative abundance of intestinal microbiota in saline and microbiota transferred LY piglets, we identified and validated Lactobacillus gasseri LA39 and Lactobacillus frumenti as two bacterial species that mediate diarrhea resistance. Diarrhea resistance depended on the bacterial secretory circular peptide gassericin A, a bacteriocin. The binding of gassericin A to Keratin 19 (KRT19) on the plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells was essential for enhancement of fluid absorption and decreased secretion. These findings suggest the use of L. gasseri LA39 and L. frumenti as antibiotic alternatives for preventing diarrhea in mammals.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play essential roles in regulating blood vessel form and function and they are required for vascular tissue regeneration. Multipotent adipose derived stromal cells (ASCs) can be differentiated into VSMC-like cells, which can be used as a potential VSMC source for the development of vascular tissue. However, the effects of cryopreservation on the differentiation of ASCs towards VSMCs are poorly studied to date. This study compared fresh ASCs (FA) vs. cryopreserved ASCs (CA) with respect to their differentiation potential towards VSMC-like cells. The expression of contractile VSMC markers (such as smoothelin) and cell contractility were investigated. It was found that VSMC-like cells derived from CA expressed smoothelin gene and protein at lower levels and showed compromised contractility in response to vasoconstrictors, when compared with those derived from FA. Moreover, it was demonstrated that this negative effect of cryopreservation could be mediated by MEK1/2-ERK1/2, IFNγ and Smad2/3 associated Signalling pathways. Treatment of CA with MEK1/2-ERK1/2 activator or IFNγ neutralizing antibodies enhanced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and showed a rescue of the negative effect of cryopreservation on the differentiation of ASCs towards VSMC-like cells. These findings are important for defining approaches that may use cryopreserved ASCs for vascular tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Primary cilia are appendages observed in most types of cells, and serve as cellular antennae for sensing environmental signals. Evidence is accumulating that correct ciliogenesis and ciliary functions are indispensable for normal skeletal development by regulating signaling pathways important for bone development. However, whether ciliogenesis is regulated by bone-related factors in osteoblasts is largely unknown. Here we show that Kruppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4), which is known to repress osteoblast differentiation, supports the formation and maintenance of cilia in cultured osteoblasts; however, the length of the cilia observed in KLF4-induced cells were significantly shorter compared to the control cells. Basal Hedgehog signaling was repressed by KLF4. Significantly, activating Hedgehog signaling using a Smoothened agonist significantly rescued osteoblast mineralization and osteoblastic gene expressions. Global gene expression analysis showed that KLF4 induced number of genes including the nuclear receptor, Pregnane X receptor (PXR), and PXR repressed calvarial osteoblast mineralization and repressed Gli1 expression similar as the effect observed by inducing KLF4. Our results implicate that KLF4 plays important roles for maintaining osteoblasts in an immature state by repressing basal activation of the Hedgehog signaling.

Abstract: Transactive response DNA/RNA-binding protein 43-kDa (TDP-43) C-terminal fragments, such as a 25-kDa fragment (TDP-25), have been identified as a ubiquitinated and phosphorylated components of inclusion bodies (IBs) in motor neurons from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Cells contain proteins that function as molecular chaperones and prevent aggregate formation of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins. Recently, we reported that heat shock protein (HSP)70, an abundant molecular chaperone, binds to TDP-25 in an ATP-dependent manner; however, whether HSP70 can prevent the formation of TDP-25-related IBs remains unknown. Here, we showed that HSP70 prevented TDP-25 aggregation according to green fluorescent protein-tagged TDP-25 (G-TDP-25) colocalization in the cytoplasm with mCherry-tagged HSP70 (HSP70-R). The mobile fraction of HSP70-R in the cytoplasmic IBs associated with G-TDP-25 increased relative to that of G-TDP-25, suggesting that HSP70 strongly bound to G-TDP-25 in the IBs, whereas a portion remained dissociated from the IBs. Importantly, the proportion of G-TDP-25 IBs was significantly decreased by HSP70-R overexpression; however, G-TDP-25 levels in the insoluble fraction remained unchanged by HSP70-R overexpression, suggesting that G-TDP-25 formed aggregated species that cannot be dissolved, even in the presence of strong detergents. These results indicated that HSP70 prevented the accumulation of G-TDP-25 aggregates in cytoplasmic IBs, but was insufficient for G-TDP-25 disassembly and solubilization.

Abstract: This work investigated the ability of a 6-day heat acclimation protocol to impart heat acclimation-mediated cross-tolerance (HACT) in C2C12 myotubes, as indicated by changes in inflammatory and apoptotic responses to subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Myotubes were incubated at 40°C for 2 h/day over 6 days (HA) or maintained for 6 days at 37°C (C). Following 24 h recovery, myotubes from each group received either no stimulation or 500 ng/ml LPS for 2 h (HA + LPS and C + LPS, respectively). Cell lysates were collected and analyzed for protein markers of the heat shock response, inflammation, and apoptosis. As compared to C, HA exhibited an elevated heat shock response [HSP70 (+ 99%); HSP60 (+ 216%); HSP32 (+ 40%); all p < 0.01] and reduced inflammatory and apoptotic signaling [p-NF-ĸB:NF-ĸB (− 99%%); p-JNK (− 49%); all p < 0.01]. When compared to C + LPS, HA + LPS also exhibited an elevated heat shock response [HSP70 (+ 68%); HSP60 (+ 32%); HSP32 (+ 38%); all p < 0.01]. However, inflammatory and apoptotic responses in HA + LPS were increased [p-IKBa:IKBa (+ 432%); p-NF-ĸB:NF-ĸB (+ 283%); caspase-8p18 (+ 53%); p-JNK (+ 41%); all p < 0.05]. This unanticipated finding may be due to increased TLR4-mediated signaling capacity in HA + LPS, as indicated by upregulation of TLR4 [(+ 24%); MyD88 (+ 308%); p-NIK (+ 199%); and p-IKKα/b (+ 81%); all p < 0.05]. Data suggest HA reduces inflammatory and apoptotic signaling in skeletal muscle cells that are maintained under basal conditions. However, HACT is selective and does not apply to TLR4 signaling in the present model.

Abstract: Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) support wound healing processes. These cells express toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs perform important key functions when the immune system is confronted with danger signals. TLR ligation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) activates MSCs and induces intracellular signaling cascades, which affect their differentiation profile, increase the release of inflammatory cytokines and the production of reactive oxygen species. Continuing exposure to LPS triggers prolonged inflammatory reactions, which may lead to deleterious conditions, e.g. non-healing wounds. Cannabidiol (CBD) exerts anti-inflammatory processes through cannabinoid receptor dependent and independent mechanisms. In the present study, we examined whether CBD could influence the inflammatory MSC phenotype. Exposure to LPS increased the release of IL-6, as well as other soluble factors, and elevated levels of oxidized macromolecules found in cell homogenisates. While the amount of IL-6 was unaffected, co-treatment with CBD reduced the oxidative stress acting on the cells. LPS inhibited adipogenic as well as chondrogenic differentiation, which was attenuated by CBD treatment. In the case of adipogenesis, the disinhibitory effect probably depended on CBD interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. CBD could exert mild immunosuppressive properties on MSCs, while it most effectively acted anti-oxidatively and by restoring the differentiation capacity upon LPS treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the cellular properties controlling neural stem and progenitor cell (NSPC) fate choice will improve their therapeutic potential. The electrophysiological measure whole-cell membrane capacitance reflects fate bias in the neural lineage but the cellular properties underlying membrane capacitance are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that cell surface carbohydrates contribute to NSPC membrane capacitance and fate. We found NSPCs differing in fate potential express distinct patterns of glycosylation enzymes. Screening several glycosylation pathways revealed that the one forming highly branched N-glycans differs between neurogenic and astrogenic populations of cells in vitro and in vivo. Enhancing highly branched N-glycans on NSPCs significantly increases membrane capacitance and leads to the generation of more astrocytes at the expense of neurons with no effect on cell size, viability, or proliferation. These data identify the N-glycan branching pathway as a significant regulator of membrane capacitance and fate choice in the neural lineage.

Abstract: Hsp70-1A—the major stress-inducible member of the HSP70 chaperone family—is being implicated in cancer diseases with the development of resistances to standard therapies. In normal cells, the protein is purely cytosolic, but in a growing number of tumor cells, a significant fraction can be identified on to the cell surface. The anchoring mechanism is still under debate, as Hsp70-1A lacks conventional signaling sequences for translocation from the cytosol to exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and common membrane binding domains. Recent reports propose a lipid-mediated anchoring mechanism based on a specific interaction with charged, saturated lipids such as dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine (DPPS). Here, we prepared planar supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) to visualize the association of Hsp70-1A directly and on the single molecule level by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The single molecule sensitivity of our approach allowed us to explore the low concentration range of 0.05 to 1.0 μg/ml of Hsp70-1A which was not studied before. We compared the binding of the protein to bilayers with 20% DPPS lipid content both in the absence and presence of cholesterol. Hsp70-1A inserted exclusively into DPPS domains and assembled in clusters with increasing protein density. A critical density was reached for incubation with 0.5 μg/ml (7 nM); at higher concentrations, membrane defects were observed that originated from cluster centers. In the presence of cholesterol, this critical concentration leads to the formation of membrane blebs, which burst at higher concentrations supporting a previously proposed non-classical pathway for the export of Hsp70-1A by tumor cells. In the discussion of our data, we attempt to link the lipid-mediated plasma membrane localization of Hsp70-1A to its potential involvement in the development of resistances to radiation and chemotherapy based on our own findings and the current literature.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as the irreversible death of heart muscle that occurs secondary to prolonged lack of oxygen supply, which has resulted in millions of death worldwide. This study was conducted with aims of investigating how microRNA-212 (miR-212) and the inhibition of aquaporin-9 (AQP9) through the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway plays a role in the prevention of MI. The relationship between miR-212 and AQP9 was determined with the use of bioinformatics combined with the dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Next, the MI model was established and the cardiomyocytes were transfected with different mimic, inhibitor and siRNAs to investigate the specific activity of miR-212, AQP9 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in MI. The expression of miR-212, AQP9, PI3K, Akt, VEGF, Bax, and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), along with cell apoptosis were determined using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. Based on the results, AQP9 was verified as the direct target gene of miR-212. MI led to a decrease in miR-212 expression and an increase in AQP9 expression. It was also found that miR-212 activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in MI through the inhibition of AQP9 expression. The overexpression of miR-212 or silencing AQP9 decreased cardiomyocytes apoptosis. These findings indicated that the overexpression of miR-212 inhibited AQP9 by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thus decreasing cardiomyocytes apoptosis, promoting vascular regeneration and alleviating ventricular remodeling in rats with MI.

Abstract: Although parallel alignment of fibroblasts to the tension lines of scar has been evidenced in vivo, how scar contracture generates directional contraction remains largely unclear due to the lack of effective in vitro model. Fibroblast populated collagen lattice (FPCL), a widely used in vitro model, fails to mimic scar contracture since it produces concentric contraction with the random orientation of fibroblast. We hypothesized that a novel FPCL model with fibroblast alignment might produce directional contraction and then simulate scar contracture better. Here, we showed that although direct current electric fields (DCEFs) enabled fibroblasts aligned perpendicularly to the field vector, it also promoted electrotactic migration of fibroblast in FPCL. By contrast, biphasic pulse direct current electric fields (BPDCEFs), featured by reversal of the EF direction periodically, abolished the electrotactic migration, but induced fibroblast alignment in a pulse frequency dependent manner. Specifically, BPDCEF at a pulse frequency of 0.0002 Hz induced fibroblast alignment comparable to that induced by DCEF under the same field strength (300 mV/mm), leading to an enhanced contraction of FPCL along the direction of cell alignment. FPCL pretreated by BPDCEF showed an elliptical contraction whereas it was concentric in control FPCL. Further study revealed that F-actin redistributions acted as a key mechanism for the induction of fibroblasts alignment by BPDCEF. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin dynamics, abolished F-actins redistribution, and significantly suppressed the fibroblasts alignment and the directional contraction of FPCL. Importantly, BPDCEF significantly increased RhoA activity in fibroblasts, while this response was attenuated by C3 transferase pre-treatment, a potent inhibitor of RhoA, caused F-actin depolymerization and actin filament bundle randomly distributed. Taken together, our study suggests a crucial role for fibroblast orientation in scar contracture, and provides a novel FPCL model that may be feasible and effective for investigating scar contracture in vitro.

Abstract: The adipogenic differentiation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) is a critical issue in many obesity-related disorders and it can be regulated by a crucial transcription factor, CCAAT enhancer binding protein α (C/EBP-α). Apart from, the involvement of non-coding RNAs in adipogenic differentiation has also been reported. As we know, Terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA (TINCR) is required in somatic tissue differentiation. Recently, we found that TINCR could modulate adipogenic differentiation in hADSCs. As predicted by JASPAR and further confirmed by luciferase reporter gene and ChIP assays, C/EBP-α could bind to the promoter region of lncRNA TINCR to activate its expression. Further, miR-31 was confirmed as a direct target of TINCR and could be negatively regulated by TINCR via competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism; miR-31 inhibition enhanced the adipogenic differentiation in hADSCs. More importantly, we found that miR-31 directly bound to the 3′-UTR of C/EBP-α to inhibit its expression. Taken together, in hADSCs, lncRNA TINCR, miR-31 and C/EBP-α formed a feedback loop to modulate the adipogenic differentiation process. From the perspective of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulation, we provided a novel regulatory mechanism of hADSCs adipogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The persistence of a pool of latently HIV-1-infected cells despite combination anti-retroviral therapy treatment is the major roadblock for a cure. The BAF (mammalian SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex is involved in establishing and maintaining viral latency, making it an attractive drug target for HIV-1 latency reversal. Here we report a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of BAF-mediated transcription in cells and the subsequent identification of a 12-membered macrolactam. This compound binds ARID1A-specific BAF complexes, prevents nucleosomal positioning, and relieves transcriptional repression of HIV-1. Through this mechanism, these compounds are able to reverse HIV-1 latency in an in vitro T cell line, an ex vivo primary cell model of HIV-1 latency, and in patient CD4+ T cells without toxicity or T cell activation. These macrolactams represent a class of latency reversal agents with unique mechanism of action, and can be combined with other latency reversal agents to improve reservoir targeting.

Abstract: Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs) are conserved lipid binding proteins found in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Recent findings have indicated that these proteins mainly localize to contact sites of 2 different membranous organelles. ORP6, a member of the ORP subfamily III, is one of the least studied ORPs. Using approaches in molecular cell biology, we attempted to study the characteristics of ORP6 and found that ORP6 is abundantly expressed in mouse cultured neurons. Deconvolution microscopy of cultured cerebellar granular cells revealed that ORP6 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER–plasma membrane (PM) contact sites, where it co-localized with extended synaptotagmin2 (E-Syt2), a well-known ER–PM contact site marker. E-Syt2 also co-localized with ORP3, another subfamily III member, and ORP5, a subfamily IV member. However, ORP5 does not distribute to the same ER-PM contact sites as subfamily III members. Also, the co-expression of ORP3 but not ORP5 altered the distribution of ORP6 into the processes of cerebellar neurons. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding between the intermediate region of ORP6 and ORP3 or ORP6 itself. Additionally, the localization of ORP6 in the PM decreased when co-expressed with the intermediate region of ORP6, in which the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and OSBP-related ligand binding domain (ORD) are deleted. Over-expression of this intermediate region shifted the location of a phophtidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) marker from the Golgi to the PM. Knockdown of ORP6 resulted in the same shift of the PI4P marker. Collectively, our data suggests that the recruitment of ORP6 to ER–PM contact sites is involved in the turnover of PI4P in cerebellar granular neurons.

Abstract: Atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is increasing at an unprecedented rate and subsequently leading to ocean acidification. Concomitantly, ocean warming is intensifying, leading to serious and predictable biological impairments over marine biota. Reef-building corals have proven to be very vulnerable to climate change, but little is known about the resilience of non-reef-building species. In this study, we investigated the effects of ocean warming and acidification on the antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT—catalase, and GST—glutathione S-transferase), lipid peroxidation (using malondialdehyde, MDA—levels as a biomarker) and heat shock response (HSP70/HSC70 content) of the octocoral Veretillum cynomorium. After 60 days of acclimation, no mortalities were registered in all treatments. Moreover, CAT and GST activities, as well as MDA levels, did not change significantly under warming and/or acidification. Heat shock response was significantly enhanced under warming, but high CO2 did not have a significant effect. Contrasting to many of their tropical coral-reef relatives, our findings suggest that temperate shallow-living octocorals may be able to physiologically withstand future conditions of increased temperature and acidification.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to high-fat diet (HFD) and inactivity, inflammation and microbiota composition contribute to obesity. Inhibitory immune receptors, such as NLRP12, dampen inflammation and are important for resolving inflammation, but their role in obesity is unknown. We show that obesity in humans correlates with reduced expression of adipose tissue NLRP12. Similarly, Nlrp12−/− mice show increased weight gain, adipose deposition, blood glucose, NF-κB/MAPK activation, and M1-macrophage polarization. Additionally, NLRP12 is required to mitigate HFD-induced inflammasome activation. Co-housing with wild-type animals, antibiotic treatment, or germ-free condition was sufficient to restrain inflammation, obesity, and insulin tolerance in Nlrp12−/− mice, implicating the microbiota. HFD-fed Nlrp12−/− mice display dysbiosis marked by increased obesity-associated Erysipelotrichaceae, but reduced Lachnospiraceae family and the associated enzymes required for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis. Lachnospiraceae or SCFA administration attenuates obesity, inflammation, and dysbiosis. These findings reveal that Nlrp12 reduces HFD-induced obesity by maintaining beneficial microbiota.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have emerged as a promising cardiac safety platform, demonstrated by numerous validation studies using drugs with known cardiac adverse effects in humans. However, the challenge remains to implement hiPSC-CMs into cardiac de-risking of new chemical entities (NCEs) during preclinical drug development. Here, we used the calcium transient screening assay in hiPSC-CMs to develop a hazard score system for cardiac electrical liabilities. Tolerance interval calculations and evaluation of different classes of cardio-active drugs enabled us to develop a weighted scoring matrix. This approach allowed the translation of various pharmacological effects in hiPSC-CMs into a single hazard label (no, low, high, or very high hazard). Evaluation of 587 internal NCEs and good translation to ex vivo and in vivo models for a subset of these NCEs highlight the value of the cardiac hazard scoring in facilitating the selection of compounds during early drug safety screening.

Abstract: SIRT1 is a protein deacetylase with a broad range of biological functions, many of which are known to be important in carcinogenesis, however much of the literature regarding the role of SIRT1 in cancer remains conflicting. In this study we assessed the effect of SIRT1 on the initiation and progression of thymic T cell lymphomas. We employed mouse strains in which SIRT1 activity was absent or could be reversibly modulated in conjunction with thymic lymphoma induction using either the N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) carcinogenesis or the nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) transgene. Decreased SIRT1 activity reduced the development of thymic lymphomas in the NMU-treated mice but was permissive for the formation of lung adenomas. Conversely, in the NPM-ALK transgenic mice, decreased SIRT1 activity had a modest promoting effect in the development of thymic lymphomas. The results of the work presented here add to the growing body of evidence that sirt1 is neither an outright oncogene nor a tumor suppressor. These opposing results in two models of the same disease suggest that the influence of sirt1 on carcinogenesis may lie in a role in tumor surveillance.

Abstract: We showed previously that ceramide kinase (CerK) expression increases during adipogenesis pointing to a relevant role of intracellular C1P in this process. In the present work we demonstrate that administration of exogenous C1P inhibits the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes through a mechanism involving activation of extracellularly regulated kinases (ERK) 1–2. Exogenous C1P reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and the content of triacylglycerol in these cells, and potently inhibited the expression of the early and late adipogenic markers C/EBPβ and PPARγ, respectively. C1P also reduced the secretion of leptin, which is a crucial regulator of energy balance and appetite in the organism, and is considered to be a late marker of adipogenesis. Interestingly, all of these C1P actions were reversed by pertussis toxin, suggesting the intervention of a Gi protein-coupled receptor previously identified for C1P, in this process. Also, exogenous C1P significantly reduced CerK activity. Altogether, the data presented in this work suggest that exogenous C1P may balance adipogenesis, and that targeting CerK may be a novel way for potential applications in the treatment of obesity or other inflammation-associated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal epithelial stem cell (IESC) fate is promoted by two major transcriptional regulators, the TCF4/β-catenin complex and ASCL2, which drive expression of IESC-specific factors, including Lgr5, Ephb2, and Rnf43. Canonical Wnt signaling via TCF4/β-catenin directly transactivates Ascl2, which in turn auto-regulates its own expression. Conversely, Let-7 microRNAs antagonize the IESC lineage by repressing specific mRNA targets. Here, we identify the zinc finger transcription factor PLAGL2 as a Let-7 target that regulates IESC fate. PLAGL2 drives an IESC expression signature, activates Wnt gene expression, and enhances a TCF/LEF reporter in intestinal organoids. In parallel, via cell-autonomous mechanisms, PLAGL2 is required for lineage clonal expansion and directly enhances expression of ASCL2. PLAGL2 also supports enteroid growth and survival in the context of Wnt ligand depletion. PLAGL2 expression is strongly associated with an IESC signature in colorectal cancer and may be responsible for contributing to the aberrant activation of an immature phenotype.

Abstract: We evaluated the heat shock system 70 (HSP70) in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN). Seventy-six patients with CGN patients were included in our study. Ten patients with mild proteinuria (median 0.48 [0.16–0.78] g/24 h) and ten healthy subjects served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Urinary levels of HSP70, interleukin-10, and serum levels of anti-HSP70 were measured by ELISA. The immunohistochemical peroxidase method was used to study the expression of HSP70 and Foxp3+ in kidney biopsies. TregFoxP3+ cells in the interstitium were determined morphometrically. Median urinary HSP70 levels in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) [6.57 (4.49–8.33) pg/mg] and subnephrotic range proteinuria [5.7 (4.12–6.9) pg/mg] were higher (p < 0.05) than in positive [3.7 (2.5–4.82) pg/mg] and negative [3.78 (2.89–4.84) pg/mg] controls. HSP70 expression index in tubular cells positively correlated with urinary HSP70 (Rs = 0.948, р < 0.05) and proteinuria (Rs = 0.362, p < 0.05). The number of TregFoxp3+ cells in the kidney interstitium and interleukin-10 excretion were lower in patients with NS. Anti-HSP70 antibody serum levels in patients with NS [21.1 (17.47–29.72) pg/ml] and subnephrotic range proteinuria [24.9 (18.86–30.92) pg/ml] were significantly higher than in positive [17.8 (12.95–23.03) pg/ml] and negative [18.9 (13.5–23.9) pg/ml] controls. In patients with CGN, increasing proteinuria was associated with higher HSP70 renal tissue and urinary levels. However, activation of HSP70 in patients with nephrotic syndrome did not lead to an increase in tissue levels of TregFoxp3+ cells or to the release of IL-10.

Abstract: Summary
5-Nitrofurans are antibiotic pro-drugs that have potential as cancer therapeutics. Here, we show that 5-nitrofurans can be bio-activated by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A1/1A3 enzymes that are highly expressed in a subpopulation of cancer-initiating (stem) cells. We discover that the 5-nitrofuran, nifuroxazide, is selective for bio-activation by ALDH1 isoforms over ALDH2, whereby it both oxidizes ALDH1 and is converted to cytotoxic metabolites in a two-hit pro-drug mechanism. We show that ALDH1High melanoma cells are sensitive to nifuroxazide, while ALDH1A3 loss-of-function mutations confer drug resistance. In tumors, nifuroxazide targets ALDH1High melanoma subpopulations with the subsequent loss of melanoma-initiating cell potential. BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy increases ALDH1 expression in patient melanomas, and effectively combines with nifuroxazide in melanoma cell models. The selective eradication of ALDH1High cells by nifuroxazide-ALDH1 activation goes beyond current strategies based on inhibiting ALDH1 and provides a rational basis for the nifuroxazide mechanism of action in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
To invade cells, the parasite Toxoplasma gondii injects a multi-unit nanodevice into the target cell plasma membrane (PM). The core nanodevice, which is composed of the RhOptry Neck (RON) protein complex, connects Toxoplasma and host cell through a circular tight junction (TJ). We now report that this RON nanodevice mechanically promotes membrane scission at the TJ-PM interface, directing a physical rotation driven by the parasite twisting motion that enables the budding parasitophorous vacuole (PV) to seal and separate from the host cell PM as a bona fide subcellular Toxoplasma-loaded PV. Mechanically impairing the process induces swelling of the budding PV and death of the parasite but not host cell. Moreover, this study reveals that the parasite nanodevice functions as a molecular trigger to promote PV membrane remodeling and rapid onset of T. gondii to intracellular lifestyle.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterial infection leads to the formation of characteristic immune aggregates called granulomas, a process accompanied by dramatic remodeling of the host vasculature. As granuloma angiogenesis favors the infecting mycobacteria, it may be actively promoted by bacterial determinants during infection. Using Mycobacterium marinum-infected zebrafish as a model, we identify the enzyme proximal cyclopropane synthase of alpha-mycolates (PcaA) as an important bacterial determinant of granuloma-associated angiogenesis. cis-Cyclopropanation of mycobacterial mycolic acids by pcaA drives the activation of host Vegf signaling within granuloma macrophages. Cyclopropanation of the mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid trehalose dimycolate is both required and sufficient to induce robust host angiogenesis. Inducible genetic inhibition of angiogenesis and Vegf signaling during granuloma formation results in bacterial growth deficits. Together, these data reveal a mechanism by which PcaA-mediated cis-cyclopropanation of mycolic acids promotes bacterial growth and dissemination in vivo by eliciting granuloma vascularization and suggest potential approaches for host-directed therapies.

Abstract: To investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in high glucose-induced endothelial cell dysfunction. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were cultured in high glucose medium, and TRAF6 expression was assayed by quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and western blotting. The effect of TRAF6 on in vitro endothelial cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and endothelial–monocyte adhesion was investigated by gene knockdown. The expression of TRAF6 and related adhesion molecules was assayed in a mouse streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes model. The signaling pathways associated with TRAF6 effects on endothelial cells were investigated in high glucose HAEC cultures. Culture of HAECs in high glucose medium significantly increased TRAF6 mRNA and protein expression in a time dependent manner. High glucose markedly reduced HAEC viability, apoptosis, and migration, and these effects was significantly reversed by TRAF6 knockdown. High glucose significantly increased intercellular adhesion of THP-1 monocytic cells and HAECs via upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, and TRAF6 knockdown attenuated the effect on THP-1 cell adhesion. TRAF6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 expression were increased in aorta tissue of mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine attenuated TRAF6 expression in HAECs cultured in high glucose medium, and TRAF6 knockdown inhibited high glucose-induced IκB-α degradation and JNK phosphorylation. TRAF6 mediated high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction via NF-κB- and AP-1-dependent signaling. Targeting TRAF6 may delay progression of vascular diseases during diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (ECV) reflect physiological or pathological conditions, emerging as potential biomarkers for disease. They can be obtained from a variety of body fluids, particularly urine that is an ideal source because it can be obtained in great quantities, recurrently and with minimal intervention. However, the characterization of urine ECV is challenging because the preparation is usually contaminated with soluble proteins, such as uromodulin (UMOD) or Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein that forms large extracellular filaments co-sedimenting with ECV. We developed a method to obtain human urine ECV free of UMOD by the addition of ZnSO4 prior to vesicle isolation by differential centrifugation. Treatment with ZnSO4 did not affect the size and concentration of the vesicle preparation and preserved the storage of the samples at low temperatures. We did not observe a variation in the number of vesicles isolated during different times of the day or different days between different donors. The glycoprotein pattern of urine ECV was characterized by binding to concanavalin A (Con A) and mass spectroscopy. Several markers were found, including dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26), vacuolar protein sorting factor 4A (VPS4A) and dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1), and galectin 3 binding protein (G3-BP). The levels of VPS4A and DPEP1 were similar in ECV preparations obtained from several donors of both sexes. Con A binding pattern and monosaccharide composition were also comparable between subjects. In summary, our method for the isolation of highly pure ECV derived from human urine is likely to help in the use of these vesicles as potential biomarkers.

Abstract: The use of highly inducible HSP promoters for exerting spatial and/or temporal control over the expression of therapeutic transgenes has long been discussed. Localized and time-limited induction of the heat shock response may potentially also be of medical interest. However, such applications would require targeted delivery of heat doses capable of activating HSP promoters in tissues or organs of interest. Accessible areas, including the skin and tissues immediately underneath it, may be most readily targeted. A few applications for heat-directed or heat-controlled therapy in the skin might involve expression of proteins to restore or protect normal skin function, protein antigens for vaccination/immunotherapy, vaccine viruses or even systemically active proteins, e.g., cytokines and chemokines. A review of the literature relating to localized heat activation of HSP promoters and HSP genes in the skin revealed that a multitude of different technologies has been explored in small animal models. In contrast, we uncovered few publications that examine HSP promoter activation in human skin. None of these publications has a therapeutic focus. We present herein two, clinically relevant, developments of heating technologies that effectively activate HSP promoters in targeted regions of human skin. The first development advances a system that is capable of reliably activating HSP promoters in human scalp, in particular in hair follicles. The second development outlines a simple, robust, and inexpensive methodology for locally activating HSP promoters in small, defined skin areas.

Abstract: The use of imatinib mesylate has greatly improved the clinical outcome for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients. However, imatinib resistance is still a major clinical challenge, and the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We have previously shown that miR-125a-5p and its mRNA target PTPN18 modulate imatinib response in GIST cells. Herein, we evaluated phosphorylated FAK (pFAK) as a candidate downstream target of PTPN18 and the possible association of this regulation with imatinib resistance in GIST. FAK and pFAK expressions were evaluated in GIST882 cells transfected with short hairpin RNA or short interfering RNA targeting PTPN18 or miR-125a-5p mimic, imatinib-resistant GIST882R subclones and clinical samples using Western blot analyses. FAK phosphorylation was blocked using the FAK inhibitor 14 (FAKi) and the effects on cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using WST-1 assay and cleaved PARP expression. Clinical associations of FAK and pFAK expression with imatinib resistance, KIT mutation and patient outcome were assessed by Fisher's exact test or log-rank test. Over-expression of miR-125a-5p and silencing of PTPN18 increased pFAK, but not FAK, expression in GIST cells. Higher pFAK expression was observed in the GIST882R subclones with acquired imatinib resistance compared to their imatinib-sensitive parental cells. Treatment with FAKi in imatinib-resistant GIST882R cells reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis upon imatinib treatment. Additionally, FAKi could rescue the imatinib resistance effect mediated by miR-125a-5p over-expression. In clinical samples, high FAK and pFAK expressions were associated with KIT mutation status, and high FAK expression was also associated with metastasis in GIST. Higher pFAK was found in cases with shorter overall survival. Our findings highlight an important role for miR-125a-5p regulation and its downstream target pFAK for imatinib resistance in GIST. pFAK and FAK may have prognostic values in GIST.

We previously demonstrated that an actin-bundling protein L-plastin has a role in the cross-linking of actin filaments into tight bundles and forms actin aggregates (denoted as nascent sealing zones). These nascent sealing zones mature into fully functional sealing rings. We have shown here that TNF-alpha signaling regulates the phosphorylation of serine-5 and -7 in L-plastin which increases the actin bundling capacity of L-plastin and hence the formation of nascent sealing zones in mouse osteoclasts. Using the TAT-mediated transduction method, we confirmed the role of L-plastin in nascent sealing zones formation at the early phase of the sealing ring assembly. Transduction of TAT-fused full-length L-plastin peptide significantly increases the number of nascent sealing zones and therefore sealing rings. But, transduction of amino-terminal L-plastin peptides consisting of the serine-5 and -7 reduces the formation of both nascent sealing zones and sealing rings. Therefore, bone resorption in vitro was reduced considerably. The decrease was associated with the selective inhibition of cellular L-plastin phosphorylation by the transduced peptides. Neither the formation of podosomes nor the migration was affected in these osteoclasts. Phosphorylation of L- plastin on serine 5 and -7 residues increases the F-actin bundling capacity. The significance of our studies stands on laying the groundwork for a better understanding of L-plastin as a potential regulator at the early phase of sealing ring formation and could be a new therapeutic target to treat bone loss

Abstract: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health burden as chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is associated with the development of liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To gain insight into the mechanisms causing HBV-related HCC, we investigated the effects of HBV replication on global host cell gene expression using human HepG2 liver cells. By microarray analysis, we identified 54 differentially expressed genes in HBV-replicating HepG2 cells. One of the differentially-expressed genes was insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) which was downregulated in HBV-replicating cells. Consistent with the gene expression data, IGFBP1 was suppressed at both the cellular and secreted protein levels in the presence of HBV replication. Transient transfection experiments with an inducible plasmid encoding the HBV X protein (HBx) revealed that HBx alone was sufficient to modulate IGFBP1 expression. Small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated loss of function studies revealed that knockdown of IGFBP1 reduced apoptosis induced by either thapsigargin (TG) or staurosporine (STS). Treatment of cells with recombinant insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) decreased both TG- or STS-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, addition of recombinant IGFBP1 reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1 on TG-induced, but not STS-induced, apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest an anti-apoptotic autocrine function of HBV-mediated downregulation of IGFBP1 in HepG2 cells. Such an effect may contribute to the development of HBV-mediated HCC by increasing pro-survival and anti-apoptotic IGF-1 effects.

Abstract: Summary
The acquisition and development of the infant microbiome are key to establishing a healthy host-microbiome symbiosis. The maternal microbial reservoir is thought to play a crucial role in this process. However, the source and transmission routes of the infant pioneering microbes are poorly understood. To address this, we longitudinally sampled the microbiome of 25 mother-infant pairs across multiple body sites from birth up to 4 months postpartum. Strain-level metagenomic profiling showed a rapid influx of microbes at birth followed by strong selection during the first few days of life. Maternal skin and vaginal strains colonize only transiently, and the infant continues to acquire microbes from distinct maternal sources after birth. Maternal gut strains proved more persistent in the infant gut and ecologically better adapted than those acquired from other sources. Together, these data describe the mother-to-infant microbiome transmission routes that are integral in the development of the infant microbiome.

Abstract: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) belongs to a family of ligand-activated nuclear receptors known to regulate many crucial physiological and pathological conditions. Indeed, altered PPARγ transcriptional activity contributes to metabolic syndromes (obesity and hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus), stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Various studies suggest that PPARγ agonists influence neuronal deficits in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients and rodent models of AD. Expression of amyloid-beta (Aβ), a neuropathological marker associated with the pathogenesis of AD neuronal impairment, is inversely correlated with the activation of PPARγ-dependent neuroprotective responses. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms by which the effects of PPARγ agonists in AD remain to be clarified. Here, we explore the PPARγ signaling pathways and networks that protect against Aβ-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (e.g., caspase 4, Bip, CHOP, ASK1 and ER calcium), cell death (e.g., viability and cytochrome c) and mitochondrial deficiency (e.g., maximal respiratory function, COX activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential) events in the human neural stem cells (hNSCs) treated with Aβ. Co-treatment with GW9662 (an antagonist of PPARγ) effectively blocked these protective effects by rosiglitazone, providing strong evidence that PPARγ-dependent signaling rescues hNSCs from Aβ-mediated toxicity. Together, our data suggest activation of PPARγ pathway might be critical to protecting against AD-related ER stress, ER disequilibrium and mitochondrial deficiency. These findings also improve our understanding of the role of PPARγ in hNSCs, and may aid in the development and implementation of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD.

Abstract: Summary
Protein ADP-ribosylation is a highly dynamic post-translational modification. The rapid turnover is achieved, among others, by ADP-(ribosyl)hydrolases (ARHs), an ancient family of enzymes that reverses this modification. Recently ARHs came into focus due to their role as regulators of cellular stresses and tumor suppressors. Here we present a comprehensive structural analysis of the enzymatically active family members ARH1 and ARH3. These two enzymes have very distinct substrate requirements. Our data show that binding of the adenosine ribose moiety is highly diverged between the two enzymes, whereas the active sites harboring the distal ribose closely resemble each other. Despite this apparent similarity, we elucidate the structural basis for the selective inhibition of ARH3 by the ADP-ribose analogues ADP-HPD and arginine-ADP-ribose. Together, our biochemical and structural work provides important insights into the mode of enzyme-ligand interaction, helps to understand differences in their catalytic behavior, and provides useful tools for targeted drug design.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects several areas of the CNS, whose pathogenesis is still widely unclear and for which an effective treatment is lacking. We have generated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons from four MSA patients and four healthy controls and from two monozygotic twins discordant for the disease. In this model, we have demonstrated an aberrant autophagic flow and a mitochondrial dysregulation involving respiratory chain activity, mitochondrial content, and CoQ10 biosynthesis. These defective mechanisms may contribute to the onset of the disease, representing potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. However, the balance between genome-encoded APA processing and autoregulation by APA modulating RNA binding protein (RBP) factors is not well understood. We discovered two potent small-molecule modulators of APA (T4 and T5) that promote distal-to-proximal (DtoP) APA usage in multiple transcripts. Monotonically responsive APA events, induced by short exposure to T4 or T5, were defined in the transcriptome, allowing clear isolation of the genomic sequence features and RBP motifs associated with DtoP regulation. We found that longer vulnerable introns, enriched with distinctive A-rich motifs, were preferentially affected by DtoP APA, thus defining a core set of genes with genomically encoded DtoP regulation. Through APA response pattern and compound-small interfering RNA epistasis analysis of APA-associated RBP factors, we further demonstrated that DtoP APA usage is partly modulated by altered autoregulation of polyadenylate binding nuclear protein-1 signaling.

Abstract: Tight junctions (TJs) alteration is commonly seen in airway inflammatory diseases. Oncostatin M (OSM) is an inflammatory mediator associated with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). We have previously shown that human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) are highly permissive cells for influenza A virus (IAV). However, its role in TJs alteration and the effects of IAV on inducing OSM expression in nasal epithelium remains to be further investigated. In this study, OSM and TJs expression was measured and compared between inferior turbinate from healthy controls and nasal polyps from CRSwNP. Additionally, hNECs cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) were infected with H3N2 influenza virus to study the role of influenza virus in inducing epithelial OSM expression as a possible means of exacerbation. The expression of ZO-1, claudin-1, and occludin was markedly decreased and correlated negatively with that of OSM in CRSwNP. By using the in vitro hNEC model, H3N2 infection resulted in significantly increased OSM expression (2.2-, 4.7- and 3.9-fold higher at 8, 24, and 48 h post-infection vs. mock infection). Furthermore, OSM is found to co-localize with ciliated and goblet cells in hNECs infected with H3N2 influenza virus. Our findings demonstrated that increased OSM expression is implicated in CRSwNP as a possible mechanism of TJs’ impairment, which can be further augmented following influenza infection via epithelial OSM expression, possibly contributing to exacerbations.

Abstract: Up-regulation of mammalian COP9 signalosome subunit 6 (CSN6) and consequent reduction of SCF ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor β-transduction repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) have been shown to be associated with cancer cells proliferation. However, it is unclear whether CSN6 and β-TrCP are also involved in PDGF-induced pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) proliferation. This study aims to address this issue and further explore its potential mechanisms. Our results indicated that PDGF phosphorylated Akt, stimulated PASMCs proliferation; while inhibition of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) by imatinib prevented these effects. PDGF further up-regulated CSN6 protein expression, this was accompanied with β-TrCP reduction and increase of Cdc25A. Inhibition of PDGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway reversed PDGF-induced such changes and cell proliferation. Prior transfection of CSN6 siRNA blocked PDGF-induced β-TrCP down-regulation, Cdc25A up-regulation and cell proliferation. Furthermore, pre-treatment of cells with MG-132 also abolished PDGF-induced β-TrCP reduction, Cdc25A elevation and cell proliferation. In addition, pre-depletion of Cdc25A by siRNA transfection suppressed PDGF-induced PASMCs proliferation. Taken together, our study indicates that up-regulation of CSN6 by PDGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway decreases β-TrCP by increasing its ubiquitinated degradation, and thereby increases the expression of Cdc25A, which promotes PDGF-induced PASMCs proliferation.

Abstract: Mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene have been identified in familial ALS in human. Drosophila contains a single ortholog of human FUS called Cabeza (Caz). We previously established Drosophila models of ALS targeted to Caz, which developed the locomotive dysfunction and caused anatomical defects in presynaptic terminals of motoneurons. Accumulating evidence suggests that ALS and cancer share defects in many cellular processes. The Hippo pathway was originally discovered in Drosophila and plays a role as a tumor suppressor in mammals. We aimed to determine whether Hippo pathway genes modify the ALS phenotype using Caz knockdown flies. We found a genetic link between Caz and Hippo (hpo), the Drosophila ortholog of human Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase (MST) 1 and 2. Loss-of-function mutations of hpo rescued Caz knockdown-induced eye- and neuron-specific defects. The decreased Caz levels in nuclei induced by Caz knockdown were also rescued by loss of function mutations of hpo. Moreover, hpo mRNA level was dramatically increased in Caz knockdown larvae, indicating that Caz negatively regulated hpo. Our results demonstrate that hpo, Drosophila MST, is a novel modifier of Drosophila FUS. Therapeutic targets that inhibit the function of MST could modify the pathogenic processes of ALS.

Abstract: In the last ten years, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have gained interest as an attractive cell population in regenerative medicine for vascular applications. This population is defined as the precursor of endothelial mature cells (ECs) through a process of differentiation. To our knowledge, no single marker can be used to discriminate them from mature ECs. To effectively study their differentiation kinetics, gene expression must be assessed. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyze gene expression. To minimize the impact of variances from RT-qPCR, a rigorous selection of reference genes must be performed prior to any experiments due to variations in experimental conditions. In this study, CD34+ mononuclear cells were extracted from human cord blood and differentiated into EPCs after seeding for a maximum period of 21 days. To choose the best combinations of reference genes, we compared the results of EPCs, CD34+ mononuclear cells, and mature endothelial cells to ensure that the differentiation kinetics did not affect the expression of our selected reference genes. The expression levels of seven genes, namely, YWHAZ, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPLP0, UBC, B2M, and TBP were thus compared. The algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the Comparative ΔCt method were employed to assess the expression of each candidate gene. Overall results reveal that the expression stability of reference genes may differ depending on the statistical program used. YWHAZ, GAPDH, and UBC composed the optimal set of reference genes for the gene expression studies performed by RT-qPCR in our experimental conditions. This work can thus serve as a starting point for the selection of candidate reference genes to normalize the levels of gene expression in endothelial progenitor cell populations.

Abstract: Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), when activated, are characterized by proliferation and collagen synthesis, and contribute to extracellular matrix deposition in pancreatic fibrosis. Concomitantly, fibrosis is linked with the loss of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) protein in several organs. This study investigated the association between PTEN protein levels and the activated or apoptotic status of PSCs in a rat model of chronic pancreatitis. In addition, the activation status and biological behaviors of culture-activated PSCs were analyzed after lentiviral transfection with wildtype or mutant (G129E) PTEN for upregulation, or PTEN short hairpin RNA for downregulation, of PTEN. In vivo, PTEN levels gradually decreased during pancreatic fibrosis, which positively correlated with apoptosis of activated PSCs, but negatively with PSC activation. In vitro, activated PSCs with wildtype PTEN showed less proliferation, migration, and collagen synthesis compared with control PSCs, and greater numbers were apoptotic; activated PSCs with mutant PTEN showed similar, but weaker, effects. Furthermore, AKT and FAK/ERK signaling was involved in this process. In summary, activated PSCs during pancreatic fibrosis in vivo have lower levels of PTEN. In vitro, PTEN appears to prevent PSCs from further activation and promotes apoptosis through regulation of the AKT and FAK/ERK pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder of contractility in heart muscle. To gain mechanistic insight and guide pharmacological rescue, this study models HCM using isogenic pairs of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) carrying the E99K-ACTC1 cardiac actin mutation. In both 3D engineered heart tissues and 2D monolayers, arrhythmogenesis was evident in all E99K-ACTC1 hiPSC-CMs. Aberrant phenotypes were most common in hiPSC-CMs produced from the heterozygote father. Unexpectedly, pathological phenotypes were less evident in E99K-expressing hiPSC-CMs from the two sons. Mechanistic insight from Ca2+ handling expression studies prompted pharmacological rescue experiments, wherein dual dantroline/ranolazine treatment was most effective. Our data are consistent with E99K mutant protein being a central cause of HCM but the three-way interaction between the primary genetic lesion, background (epi)genetics, and donor patient age may influence the pathogenic phenotype. This illustrates the value of isogenic hiPSC-CMs in genotype-phenotype correlations.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence of functional and transcriptional heterogeneity in phenotypically similar cells examined individually has prompted interest in obtaining parallel methylome data. We describe the development and application of such a protocol to index-sorted murine and human hematopoietic cells that are highly enriched in their content of functionally defined stem cells. Utilizing an optimized single-cell bisulfite sequencing protocol, we obtained quantitative DNA methylation measurements of up to 5.7 million CpGs in single hematopoietic cells. In parallel, we developed an analytical strategy (PDclust) to define single-cell DNA methylation states through pairwise comparisons of single-CpG methylation measurements. PDclust revealed that a single-cell epigenetic state can be described by a small (<1%) stochastically sampled fraction of CpGs and that these states are reflective of cell identity and state. Using relationships revealed by PDclust, we derive near complete methylomes for epigenetically distinct subpopulations of hematopoietic cells enriched for functional stem cell content.

Abstract: The neural tube consists of neural progenitors (NPs) that acquire different characteristics during gestation due to patterning factors. However, the influence of such patterning factors on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) during in vitro neural differentiation is often unclear. This study compared neural induction protocols involving in vitro patterning with single SMAD inhibition (SSI), retinoic acid (RA) administration and dual SMAD inhibition (DSI). While the derived NP cells expressed known NP markers, they differed in their NP expression profile and differentiation potential. Cortical neuronal cells generated from 1) SSI NPs exhibited less mature neuronal phenotypes, 2) RA NPs exhibited an increased GABAergic phenotype, and 3) DSI NPs exhibited greater expression of glutamatergic lineage markers. Further, although all NPs generated astrocytes, astrocytes derived from the RA-induced NPs had the highest GFAP expression. Differences between NP populations included differential expression of regional identity markers HOXB4, LBX1, OTX1 and GSX2, which persisted into mature neural cell stages. This study suggests that patterning factors regulate how potential NPs may differentiate into specific neuronal and glial cell types in vitro. This challenges the utility of generic neural induction procedures, while highlighting the importance of carefully selecting specific NP protocols.

Abstract: The successful exploitation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for research, translational or commercial reasons requires the implementation of a simple and efficient cryopreservation method. Cryopreservation is usually performed with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), in addition to animal proteins. However, even at sub-toxic levels, DMSO diminishes the pluripotency capacity of hPSCs and affects their epigenetic system by acting on the three DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and histone modification enzymes. Our study aimed to test trehalose-based cryosolutions containing ethylene glycol (EG) or glycerol (GLY) on hESCs RC17, hiPSCs CTR2#6 and long-term neuroepithelial-like stem cells (lt-NES) AF22. Here, we demostrate the effectiveness of these cryosolutions in hPSCs by showing an acceptable rate of cell viability and high stability compared to standard 10% DMSO freezing medium (CS10). All cell lines retained their morphology, self renewal potential and pluripotency, and none of the cryosolutions affected their differentiation potential. Genotoxicity varied among different stem cells types, while trehalose-based cryopreservation did not sensibly alter the homeostasis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This study provides evidence that pluripotent and neural stem cells stored in trehalose alone or with other cryoprotectants (CPAs) maintain their functional properties, indicating their potential use in cell therapies if produced in good manufacturing practice (GMP) facility.

Abstract: Summary
The bacteria-derived tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS)/tRNA pair was first used for unnatural amino acid (Uaa) mutagenesis in eukaryotic cells over 15 years ago. It provides an ideal platform to genetically encode numerous useful Uaas in eukaryotes. However, this pair has been engineered to charge only a small collection of Uaas to date. Development of Uaa-selective variants of this pair has been limited by technical challenges associated with a yeast-based directed evolution platform, which is currently required to alter its substrate specificity. Here we overcome this limitation by enabling its directed evolution in an engineered strain of E. coli (ATMY), where the endogenous TyrRS/tRNA pair has been functionally replaced with an archaeal counterpart. The facile E. coli-based selection system enabled rapid engineering of this pair to develop variants that selectively incorporate various Uaas, including p-boronophenylalanine, into proteins expressed in mammalian cells as well as in the ATMY strain of E. coli.

Abstract: Summary
In the case of organ transplantation accompanied by vascular anastomosis, major histocompatibility complex mismatched vascular endothelial cells become a target for graft rejection. Production of a rejection-free, transplantable organ, therefore, requires simultaneous generation of vascular endothelial cells within the organ. To generate pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived vascular endothelial cells, we performed blastocyst complementation with a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 homozygous mutant blastocyst. This mutation is embryonic lethal at embryonic (E) day 8.5–9.5 due to an early defect in endothelial and hematopoietic cells. The Flk-1 homozygous knockout chimeric mice survived to adulthood for over 1 year without any abnormality, and all vascular endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells were derived from the injected PSCs. This approach could be used in conjunction with other gene knockouts which induce organ deficiency to produce a rejection-free, transplantable organ in which all the organ's cells and vasculature are PSC derived.

Abstract: Successful skeletal muscle wound repair requires the alignment and fusion of myoblasts to generate multinucleated myofibers. In vitro, the accurate quantification of cellular alignment remains a challenge. Here we present the application of ImageJ and ct-FIRE to quantify muscle cell orientation by means of an alignment index (AI). Our optimised method, which does not require programming skills, allows the alignment of myoblasts in vitro to be determined independently of a predefined reference point. Using this method, we demonstrate that co-culture of myoblasts with macrophages, but not fibroblasts, promotes myoblast alignment in a cell density-dependent manner. Interestingly, myoblast fusion was significantly decreased in response to co-culture with macrophages, while the effect of fibroblasts on fusion was density-dependent. At lower numbers, fibroblasts significantly increased myoblast fusion, whereas at higher numbers a significant decrease was observed. Finally, triple co-culture revealed that the effect of macrophages on myoblast alignment and fusion is unaltered by the additional presence of fibroblasts. Application of our optimised method has therefore revealed quantitative differences in the roles of macrophages versus fibroblasts during alignment and fusion: while successful myoblast alignment is promoted by increasing macrophage numbers, regenerative fusion coincides with a decreasing macrophage population and initial rise in fibroblast numbers.

Abstract: Various environmental stresses, such as heat shock, heavy metals, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and different pesticides, induce a cellular oxidative stress response. The cellular oxidative stress response is usually regulated by heat shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones. Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), one of the most widely studied co-chaperones, functions as an adaptor that directs Hsp90 to Hsp70-client protein complexes. However, the biological functions of STIP1 remain poorly understood in honeybee (Apis cerana cerana). In this study, AccSTIP1 was identified in Apis cerana cerana. AccSTIP1 transcription was found to be induced by heat (42 °C), HgCl2, H2O2 and different pesticides (emamectin benzoate, thiamethoxam, hexythiazox and paraquat) and inhibited by CdCl2, UV and kresoxim-methyl. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the expression profiles of AccSTIP1 were consistent with its transcriptional expression levels. The disc diffusion assay showed that chemically competent transetta (DE3) bacteria expressing a recombinant AccSTIP1 protein displayed the smaller death zones than did control bacteria after exposure to paraquat and HgCl2. The DNA nicking assay suggested that recombinant purified AccSTIP1 protected supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA from damage caused by a thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation (MFO) system. After knocking down AccSTIP1 gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi), the transcript levels of antioxidation-related genes were obviously lower in dsAccSTIP1 honeybees compared with those in the uninjected honeybees. Collectively, these results demonstrated that AccSTIP1 plays an important role in counteracting oxidative stress. This study lays a foundation for revealing the mechanism of AccSTIP1 in the Apis cerana cerana antioxidant system.

Abstract: Summary
Viral proteins have evolved to target cellular organelles and usurp their functions for virus replication. Despite the knowledge of these critical functions for several organelles, little is known about peroxisomes during infection. Peroxisomes are primarily metabolic organelles with important functions in lipid metabolism. Here, we discovered that the enveloped viruses human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) induce the biogenesis of and unique morphological changes to peroxisomes to support their replication. Targeted proteomic quantification revealed a global virus-induced upregulation of peroxisomal proteins. Mathematical modeling and microscopy structural analysis show that infection triggers peroxisome growth and fission, leading to increased peroxisome numbers and irregular disc-like structures. HCMV-induced peroxisome biogenesis increased the phospholipid plasmalogen, thereby enhancing virus production. Peroxisome regulation and dependence were not observed for the non-enveloped adenovirus. Our findings uncover a role of peroxisomes in viral pathogenesis, with likely implications for multiple enveloped viruses.

Abstract: Summary
H7N9 low pathogenic influenza viruses emerged in China in 2013 and mutated to highly pathogenic strains in 2017, resulting in human infections and disease in chickens. To control spread, a bivalent H5/H7 inactivated vaccine was introduced in poultry in September 2017. To monitor virus evolution and vaccine efficacy, we collected 53,884 poultry samples across China from February 2017 to January 2018. We isolated 252 H7N9 low pathogenic viruses, 69 H7N9 highly pathogenic viruses, and one H7N2 highly pathogenic virus, of which two low pathogenic and 14 highly pathogenic strains were collected after vaccine introduction. Genetic analysis of highly pathogenic strains revealed nine genotypes, one of which is predominant and widespread and contains strains exhibiting high virulence in mice. Additionally, some H7N9 and H7N2 viruses carrying duck virus genes are lethal in ducks. Thus, although vaccination reduced H7N9 infections, the increased virulence and expanded host range to ducks pose new challenges.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease caused by selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Although most cases of PD are sporadic cases, familial PD provides a versatile research model for basic mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of PD. In this study, we generated DA neurons from PARK2 patient-specific, isogenic PARK2 null and PARK6 patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and found that these neurons exhibited more apoptosis and greater susceptibility to rotenone-induced mitochondrial stress. From phenotypic screening with an FDA-approved drug library, one voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist, benidipine, was found to suppress rotenone-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and increased susceptibility to rotenone-induced stress in PD, which is prevented by T-type calcium channel knockdown or antagonists. These findings suggest that calcium homeostasis in DA neurons might be a useful target for developing new drugs for PD patients.

Abstract: Summary
Small molecules offer powerful ways to alter protein function. However, most proteins in the human proteome lack small-molecule probes, including the large class of non-catalytic transmembrane receptors, such as death receptors. We hypothesized that small molecules targeting the interfaces between transmembrane domains (TMDs) in receptor complexes may induce conformational changes that alter receptor function. Applying this concept in a screening assay, we identified a compound targeting the TMD of death receptor p75NTR that induced profound conformational changes and receptor activity. The compound triggered apoptotic cell death dependent on p75NTR and JNK activity in neurons and melanoma cells, and inhibited tumor growth in a melanoma mouse model. Due to their small size and crucial role in receptor activation, TMDs represent attractive targets for small-molecule manipulation of receptor function.

Abstract: Tendon derived stem cells (TDSCs) were vital in tendon homeostasis. Nevertheless, the regulation of TDSCs differentiation in tendinopathy is unclear. Matrix stiffness modulated stem cells differentiation, and matrix stiffness of tendinopathic tissues decreased significantly. In order to clarify the role of matrix stiffness in TDSCs differentiation, they were cultured on the gelatin hydrogels with the stiffness from 2.34 ± 1.48 kPa to 24.09 ± 14.03 kPa. The effect of matrix stiffness on TDSCs proliferation and differentiation were investigated with CCK8 assay, immunofluorescences, real time PCR and western blot. It was found the proliferation of TDSCs increased and more stress fibers formed with increasing matrix stiffness. The differentiation of TDSCs into tenogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages were inhibited on stiff hydrogel evidenced by reduced expression of tenocyte markers THBS4, TNMD, SCX, chondrocyte marker COL2, and osteocyte markers Runx2, Osterix, and ALP. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK1/2 were enhanced when TDSCs grew on stiff hydrogel. After FAK or ERK1/2 was inhibited, the effect of matrix stiffness on differentiation of TDSCs was inhibited as well. The above results indicated matrix stiffness modulated the proliferation and differentiation of TDSCs, and the regulation effect could correlate to the activation of FAK or ERK1/2.

Abstract: SOX4 has been shown to promote neuronal differentiation both in the adult and embryonic neural progenitors. Ectopic SOX4 expression has also been shown to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation in mice, however the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that SOX4 regulates transcriptional targets associated with neural development in neural stem cells (NSCs), reducing the expression of genes promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation. Interestingly, we observe that SOX4 levels decreased during oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. Moreover, we show that SOX4 knockdown induces increased oligodendrocyte differentiation, as the percentage of Olig2-positive/2′,3’-Cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)-positive maturing oligodendrocytes increases, while the number of Olig2-positive oligodendrocyte precursors is unaffected. Conversely, conditional SOX4 overexpression utilizing a doxycycline inducible system decreases the percentage of maturing oligodendrocytes, suggesting that SOX4 inhibits maturation from precursor to mature oligodendrocyte. We identify the transcription factor Hes5 as a direct SOX4 target gene and we show that conditional overexpression of Hes5 rescues the increased oligodendrocyte differentiation mediated by SOX4 depletion in NSCs. Taken together, these observations support a novel role for SOX4 in NSC by controlling oligodendrocyte differentiation through induction of Hes5 expression.

Abstract: Interleukin-6 receptor-alpha (IL6R) interacts with IL6 and forms a ligand–receptor complex, which can stimulate various cellular responses, such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and activation of inflammatory processes. Both genetic mutation and epigenetic modification regulate gene transcription. We identified a novel splice variant of bovine IL6R, designated as IL6R-TV, which is characterized by the skipping of exon 2 of the NCBI-referenced IL6R gene (IL6R-reference). The expression levels of IL6R-TV and IL6R-reference transcripts were lower in normal mammary gland tissues. These transcripts play a potential role during inflammatory infection. We also detected two putative functional SNPs (g.19711 T > C and g.19731 G > C) located within the upstream 100 bp of exon 2. These SNPs formed two haplotypes (T-G and C-C). Two mutant pSPL3 exon-trapping plasmids (pSPL3-T-G and pSPL3-C-C) were transferred into the bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T) and human embryonic kidney 293 T cells (HEK293T) to investigate the relationship between the two SNPs and the aberrant splicing of IL6R. DNA methylation levels of the alternatively spliced exon in normal and mastitis-infected mammary gland tissues were quantified through nested bisulfate sequencing PCR (BSP) and cloning sequencing. We found that DNA methylation regulated IL6R transcription. The DNA methylation level was high in mastitis-infected mammary gland tissues and stimulated IL6R expression, thereby promoting the inclusion of the alternatively spliced exon. The upregulated expression of the two transcripts was due to DNA methylation modification rather than genetic mutations.

Abstract: Previous studies reported that extracellular HSP72 (eHSP72) correlates with poor prognosis, markers of vascular dysfunction, and the severity of cardiovascular diseases, associated with a systemic oxidative and inflammatory profile. On the other hand, eHSP72 may represent immune-regulatory signaling that is related to exercise benefits, but the association between physical activity levels and eHSP72 levels is not established. Thus, since regular physical activity may avoid oxidative stress and inflammation, we investigate whether detectable levels of eHSP72 in plasma are associated with physical activity and antioxidant enzyme activity levels in hypertensive subjects. Physical activity levels of hypertensive subjects (n = 140) were measured by tri-axial movement sensor pedometer for 24 h during 5 consecutive days. One day after, blood was collected into heparinized tubes for oxidative stress analyses (catalase—CAT and superoxide dismutase—SOD activities and malondialdehyde levels) or in disodium EDTA tubes for eHSP72 assays. Thus, hypertensive subjects were classified as physically inactive (< 10,000 footsteps/day) or active (> than 10,000 footsteps/day) and according detectable or not detectable eHSP72 levels in plasma, performing the inactive/eHSP72−, active/eHSP72−, inactive/eHSP72+, and active/eHSP72+ groups. We found that detectable levels of eHSP72 in plasma were associated with physical activity levels and low oxidative stress profile (Higher CAT and SOD activities and low malondialdehyde levels). eHSP72 levels can be used as a biomarker of the amount of physical activity necessary to improve antioxidant defense and thus cardiovascular health in hypertensive subjects.

Abstract: Summary
The dicistrovirus, Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) encodes an RNA interference (RNAi) suppressor, 1A, which modulates viral virulence. Using the Drosophila model, we combined structural, biochemical, and virological approaches to elucidate the strategies by which CrPV-1A restricts RNAi immunity. The atomic resolution structure of CrPV-1A uncovered a flexible loop that interacts with Argonaute 2 (Ago-2), thereby inhibiting Ago-2 endonuclease-dependent immunity. Mutations disrupting Ago-2 binding attenuates viral pathogenesis in wild-type but not Ago-2-deficient flies. CrPV-1A also contains a BC-box motif that enables the virus to hijack a host Cul2-Rbx1-EloBC ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes Ago-2 degradation and virus replication. Our study uncovers a viral-based dual regulatory program that restricts antiviral immunity by direct interaction with and modulation of host proteins. While the direct inhibition of Ago-2 activity provides an efficient mechanism to establish infection, the recruitment of a ubiquitin ligase complex enables CrPV-1A to amplify Ago-2 inactivation to restrict further antiviral RNAi immunity.

Abstract: Thioredoxin 2 (Trx2), as a member of the thioredoxin system in mitochondria, is involved in controlling mitochondrial redox state. However, the role of Trx2 in cardiac biology is not fully understood. In the present study, the expression of Trx2 is silenced in quiescent neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCs) and mitochondrial respiratory function and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy are assessed. The results show that Trx2 depletion does not induce significant cytotoxicity in quiescent NRVCs. Remarkably, Trx2 depletion results in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as determined by increased cell size and protein synthesis. Furthermore, Trx2 depletion inhibits AMPK activity and AMPK activator reversed cellular hypertrophy. Trx2 depletion enhances mitochondrial ROS generation without impact on cellular ROS level. Trx2 depletion has no effect on mitochondrial biogenesis. Specifically, Trx2 depletion increases mitochondrial respiration flux and total ATP concentration under quiescent conditions. To decipher the relationship between ROS generation, mitochondrial respiration flux, and AMPK signaling, mitochondrial metabolism and ROS was specifically inhibited, and the results show that AMPK inactivation and hypertrophic response in Trx2-silenced cells is reversed by respiration blockers but not ROS scavenger. In conclusion, these results show that beyond mitochondrial ROS scavenging, Trx2 controls mitochondrial respiratory function in quiescent cardiomyocytes and is implicated in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via AMPK signaling.

Abstract: Recent studies on Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) reveal a surprising role in transcriptional activation, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We previously identified a type 1 PRC (PRC1) that contains Autism Susceptibility Candidate 2 (AUTS2), which positively regulates transcription of neuronal genes. However, the mechanism by which the PRC1-AUTS2 complex influences neurodevelopment is unclear. Here we demonstrate that WDR68 is not only an integral component of the PRC1-AUTS2 complex, but it is also required for PRC1-AUTS2-mediated transcription activation. Furthermore, deletion of Wdr68 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to defects in neuronal differentiation without affecting self-renewal. Through transcriptomic analysis, we found that many genes responsible for neuronal differentiation are down-regulated in Wdr68 deficient neural progenitors. These genes include those targeted by the PRC1-AUTS2 complex. In summary, our studies uncovered a previously unknown but essential component of the active PRC1 complex and evidence of its role in regulating the expression of genes that are important for neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The selective survival advantage of culture-adapted human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is a serious safety concern for their clinical application. With a set of hESCs with various passage numbers, we observed that a subpopulation of hESCs at late passage numbers was highly resistant to various cell death stimuli, such as YM155, a survivin inhibitor. Transcriptome analysis from YM155-sensitive (YM155S) and YM155-resistant (YM155R) hESCs demonstrated that BCL2L1 was highly expressed in YM155R hESCs. By matching the gene signature of YM155R hESCs with the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal dataset, BH3 mimetics were predicted to selectively ablate these cells. Indeed, short-course treatment with a sub-optimal dose of BH3 mimetics induced the spontaneous death of YM155R, but not YM155S hESCs by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hematopoietic cells represent a highly attractive source for cell and gene therapy. Given the longevity, plasticity, and self-renewal potential of distinct macrophage subpopulations, iPSC-derived macrophages (iPSC-Mφ) appear of particular interest in this context. We here evaluated the airway residence, plasticity, and therapeutic efficacy of iPSC-Mφ in a murine model of hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (herPAP). We demonstrate that single pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT) of 2.5–4 × 106 iPSC-Mφ yields efficient airway residence with conversion of iPSC-Mφ to an alveolar macrophage (AMφ) phenotype characterized by a distinct surface marker and gene expression profile within 2 months. Moreover, PMT significantly improves alveolar protein deposition and other critical herPAP disease parameters. Thus, our data indicate iPSC-Mφ as a source of functional macrophages displaying substantial plasticity and therapeutic potential that upon pulmonary transplantation will integrate into the lung microenvironment, adopt an AMφ phenotype and gene expression pattern, and profoundly ameliorate pulmonary disease phenotypes.

Abstract: Dairy cows exposed to heat stress (HS) show decreased performance and immunity, but increased heat shock protein expressions and apoptosis. Zymosan, an extract from yeast cell walls, has been shown to modulate immune responses and defense against oxidative stress. However, few literatures are available about the effects of zymosan on immune responses and other parameters of the dairy cows under HS. Here, both primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and dairy cow models were established to assess the effects of zymosan on performance, immunity, heat shock protein, and apoptosis-related gene expressions of dairy cows under HS. In vitro study showed that proliferation, IL-2 production, and Bcl-2/Bax-α ratio of cow primary PBMC were reduced, whereas hsp70 mRNA and protein expressions, as well as Annexin V-bing, were increased when PBMCs were exposed to heat. In contrast, zymosan significantly reversed these above changes induced by the HS. In the in vivo study, 40 Holstein dairy cows were randomly selected and assigned into zymosan group (supplemental zymosan; n = 20) and control group (no supplemental zymosan; n = 20). The results showed that zymosan improved significantly the dry matter intake and milk yield, increased IgA, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) contents in sera, as well as hepatic Bcl-2/Bax-α ratio, but decreased respiration rate and hepatic hsp70 expressions in the dairy cows under HS. Taken together, zymosan could alleviate HS-induced immunosuppression and apoptosis and improve significantly the productive performance and immunity of dairy cows under HS.

Abstract: Summary
The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic highlighted the need for effective vaccines and therapeutics to limit and prevent outbreaks. Host antibodies against EBOV are critical for controlling disease, and recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can protect from infection. However, antibodies mediate an array of antiviral functions including neutralization as well as engagement of Fc-domain receptors on immune cells, resulting in phagocytosis or NK cell-mediated killing of infected cells. Thus, to understand the antibody features mediating EBOV protection, we examined specific Fc features associated with protection using a library of EBOV-specific mAbs. Neutralization was strongly associated with therapeutic protection against EBOV. However, several neutralizing mAbs failed to protect, while several non-neutralizing or weakly neutralizing mAbs could protect. Antibody-mediated effector functions, including phagocytosis and NK cell activation, were associated with protection, particularly for antibodies with moderate neutralizing activity. This framework identifies functional correlates that can inform therapeutic and vaccine design strategies against EBOV and other pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic reprogramming, which was first identified in rodents, remains poorly described in non-mammalian species. Here, we generated avian reprogrammed cells by reprogramming of chicken and duck primary embryonic fibroblasts. The efficient generation of long-term proliferating cells depends on the method of delivery of reprogramming factors and the addition of NANOG and LIN28 to the canonical OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC gene combination. The reprogrammed cells were positive for several key pluripotency-associated markers including alkaline phosphatase activity, telomerase activity, SSEA1 expression, and specific cell cycle and epigenetic markers. Upregulated endogenous pluripotency-associated genes included POU5F3 (POUV) and KLF4, whereas cells failed to upregulate NANOG and LIN28A. However, cells showed a tumorigenic propensity when injected into recipient embryos. In conclusion, although the somatic reprogramming process is active in avian primary cells, it needs to be optimized to obtain fully reprogrammed cells with similar properties to those of chicken embryonic stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
The absence of FMR1 protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome (FXS) and disturbed FMRP function is implicated in several forms of human psychopathology. We show that intracellular calcium responses to depolarization are augmented in neural progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and mouse brain with FXS. Increased calcium influx via nifedipine-sensitive voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels contributes to the exaggerated responses to depolarization and type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor activation. The ratio of L-type/T-type Cav channel expression is increased in FXS progenitors and correlates with enhanced progenitor differentiation to glutamate-responsive cells. Genetic reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in FXS mouse progenitors diminishes the expression of Cav channels and activity-dependent responses, which are associated with increased phosphorylation of the phospholipase C-γ1 site within TrkB receptors and changes of differentiating progenitor subpopulations. Our results show developmental effects of increased calcium influx via L-type Cav channels in FXS neural progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Protein engineering involves generating and screening large numbers of variants for desired properties. While modern DNA technology has made it easy to create protein diversity on the DNA level, the selection and validation of candidate proteins from large libraries remains a challenge. We built a screening platform that integrates high-quality fluorescence-based image analysis and robotic picking of bacterial colonies. It allows tracking each individual colony in a large population and collecting quantitative information on library composition during the protein evolution process. We demonstrate the power of the screening platform by optimizing a dim far-red-emitting fluorescent protein whose brightness increased several fold using iterative cycles of mutagenesis and platform-based screening. The resulting protein variant mCarmine is useful for imaging cells and structures within live tissue as well as for molecular tagging. Overall, the platform presented provides powerful, flexible, and low-cost instrumentation to accelerate many fluorescence-based protein optimization projects.

Abstract: Summary
The natural product family of macrocyclic lipodepsipeptides containing the 4-amido-2,4-pentadienoate functionality possesses intriguing cytotoxic selectivity toward hypoxic cancer cells. These subpopulations of cancer cells display increased metastatic potential and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. In this paper, we present studies on the mechanism of action of these natural products in hypoxic cancer cells and show that this involves rapid and hypoxia-selective collapse of mitochondrial integrity and function. These events drive a regulated cell death process that potentially could function as a powerful tool in the fight against chemo- and radiotherapy-resistant cancer cells. Toward that end, we demonstrate activity in two different mouse tumor models.
