Abstract: Objectives
A strikingly increased headache prevalence was recently noted in Sri Lankan beta-thalassemia patients, raising several concerns regarding long-term neurological involvement in this condition.
Methods
We interviewed on headache occurrence and characteristics 102 Italian beta-thalassemia patients and 129 healthy controls. 3T-MRI, MR-angiography, MR-venography, cognitive and psychiatric findings were considered.
Results
Headache was diagnosed in 39/102 (38.2%) beta-thalassemia patients without significant phenotype-related differences and in 51/129 (39.5%) controls. Patients and controls did not differ significantly regarding episode number (5.9 ± 6.2 vs 5.4 ± 4.4 days/month), subjective severity-score (6.8 ± 1.4 vs 7.1 ± 1.3), age-at-onset (24.3 ± 13.0 vs 19.5 ± 9.6 years) and headache-subtype rate. No main demographic, clinical or laboratory data was associated with headache but female gender. Headache was not associated with white matter lesions (number or maximal diameter), intracranial aneurysms, intracranial artery stenoses or venous sinus thrombosis. Cognitive and psychiatric evaluations were worse in beta-thalassemia, however, headache did not correlate with full-scale Intelligence Quotient (75.4 ± 18.0 vs 76.7 ± 15.3, with and without headache, respectively) or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores (29.1 ± 2.7 vs 28.5 ± 3.4).
Conclusions
Among Italian beta-thalassemia patients, headache does not seem to be more common or severe than in the general population. In addition, patients with headache do not seem to present increased conventional MRI, MR-angiography and cognitive/psychiatric changes.

Abstract: Background
Thrombocytopenia (TP) is the major event associated with linezolid (LZD) therapy. We investigated the incidence and risk factors for thrombocytopenia in hospitalized adults who received LZD (1200mg/day) between 2015 and 2017. HIV-positive, death during follow-up and those with a baseline platelet count ≤100×103/mm3 were excluded.
Method
TP was defined as a decrease in platelet count of ≥20% from the baseline level at the initiation of linezolid therapy and a final count of <100×103/mm3. The odds ratios (OR) for thrombocytopenia were obtained using multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis.
Main results
A total of 66 patients were included (mean age [SD] 62 [18], male gender [%], 37 [56]). LZD-associated TP was identified in 12 patients (18.2%). For TP, the adjusted OR [95% CI] of the platelet count ≤200×103/mm3, serum creatinine and renal impairment at baseline were 5.66 [1.15–27.9], 4.57 [1.26–16.5] and 9.41 [1.09–80.54], respectively. Male gender and dosage per weight per day (DPWD) >20mg/kg/day were not risk factors.
Conclusion
The results showed that the incidence of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia was lower in patients with normal renal function and higher in those with platelet counts ≤200×103/mm3 or serum creatinine >1.5mg/dL at the start of the treatment.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly solid tumors in the world. Aerobic glycolysis is among the characteristic features of pancreatic cancer. However, the regulatory process of aerobic glycolysis in pancreatic cancer is too complicated, and the underlying mechanism remains unexplained. Reportedly, CDK4/6 inhibitors repress breast cancer cell proliferation by modulating glucose metabolism. Here, we reveal that the CDK4/6 inhibitor, PD0332991 stabilized FBP1 to hinder aerobic glycolysis in pancreatic cancer. We also show that the CDK4/6-E2 F1 signaling pathway mediated an increase in MAGED1 expression, promoting FBP1 degradation in pancreatic cancer. We, therefore, might have identified a novel mechanism by which the CDK4/6 inhibitor, PD0332991 blocks the Warburg effect of pancreatic cancer by stabilizing FBP1.

Abstract: Background
Blood transfusion is a life-saving procedure, but may cause adverse transfusion reactions (TRs). The reporting of TRs is often missed due to various reasons. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of unreported acute TRs through active surveillance and to compare it with the incidence of passively reported TRs.
Methods
This prospective observational study was done over a period of four months at a tertiary care hospital. A total of 500 consecutive transfusion episodes (TEs) in patients who had received blood component transfusions in the intensive care units were included in the study. Comprehensive data were collected from the blood bank records, patient records and through interviews with the attending clinical staff. The TEs were defined as all blood components issued to a single patient in 24h.
Results
The overall incidence of TRs was 1.8 % (9 cases), with 0.4 % (2 cases) being reported passively, while 1.4 % (7 cases) were identified during active surveillance. The transfusion-associated cardiac overload (TACO) had the highest incidence of 1.2 % (6 cases) in active surveillance. A single case of acute hemolytic transfusion reaction was also observed during active surveillance. The passively reported TRs were one allergic reaction and one febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction.
Conclusion
Active surveillance of TRs provided an insight into the true incidence of TRs, which is higher when compared with the passively reported TRs. The TACO was found to have the highest incidence and not a single case was reported. There is a need to improve awareness regarding TR reporting.

Abstract: Introduction
Persistent hematuria is a chronic complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA) which can progress to chronic kidney disease. The practice of early detection of persistent hematuria in children with SCA in steady state is important for timely intervention.
Objective
To determine the prevalence of persistent hematuria among children with sickle cell anemia in steady state and compare the result with that of a group of HbAA controls. The outcome will possibly strengthen the health policy on the need for regular screening for persistent hematuria in children with SCA.
Methods
Children with sickle cell anemia, aged 2–18 years in steady state, were recruited consecutively from the sickle cell clinic at the University of Nigeria teaching Hospital Enugu. The controls were similarly recruited from the children’s outpatient clinic. To determine persistent hematuria, dipstick urinalysis and microscopy were performed for both subjects and controls at enrollment and repeated after four weeks.
Results
Out of the 122 children with SCA studied, 5 (4.1%) had persistent hematuria. None (0%) of the 122 age- and gender-matched HbAA controls had persistent hematuria. This difference in prevalence of persistence between HbSS patients and HbAA controls was statistically significant (p = 0.02).
Conclusion
Persistent hematuria still occurs significantly more among children with SCA, even among those in steady state. Routine urinalysis at follow-up visits in children with SCA is strongly recommended, as this will aid early detection and prompt management to prevent progression to chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: Summary
Hetero-axial cobalt complexes are known for their oxygen-tolerant photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, mostly in organic solvents. Here, variable combinations of peripheral basic groups are explicitly positioned around an existing complex framework to generate an enzyme-inspired minimal outer coordination sphere (OCS) scaffold. This catalyst design strategy yields a series of water-soluble, upgraded versions of imidazole-linked cobaloximes. The presence of fringe protic functionalities ensures the formation of a dynamic and water-mediated proton relay. This appended proton relay allows us to probe imidazole-bound cobaloxime in pure aqueous conditions. It exhibits highly efficient electrocatalytic (TOF ∼4,900 s−1) and photocatalytic (TON ∼12,000) hydrogen production in neutral water compared to its relatively moderate performance in organic media. The catalyst retains its activity (TON ∼22), even under natural sunlight (sunny day in Gandhinagar) in aerobic aqueous solution, emphasizing the importance of OCS features for producing robust, natural-condition-ready, synthetic catalysts.

Abstract: Hereditary Xerocytosis (HX) is an autosomal dominantly inherited congenital hemolytic anemia associated with erythrocyte dehydration due to decreased intracellular potassium content resulting in increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The affected members of HX families show compensated anemia with splenomegaly, hemosiderosis, and perinatal edema but are in large part transfusion independent. Functional studies show a link between mutations in mechanosensitive ion channel, encoded by PIEZO1 gene and the HX. We identified new PIEZO1 variants that are likely pathogenic in three phenotypically characterized multi-generational HX Brazilian families. Interestingly, one missense variant of the PIEZO1 gene identified, p.E2494V was associated in trans with the previously reported most frequent pathogenic duplication p.E2496ELE. The three-dimensional structure of the human protein modeled using structural coordinates of the mouse Piezo1 solved by cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-ME) showed that the two identified variants, p.M2007L and p.T2014I, are localized to an important mechanosensitive transmembrane domain suggesting a conformational mechanism for altered channel's gating. The p.E2496ELE variant identified alters the extension of helix α1 bringing it much closer to the beam affecting the position of it structure at the end of the pore.

Abstract: Background
Currently the treatment of choice for critical liver failure is liver transplantation. Liver failure is treated conservatively until a matching liver donor becomes available. The therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) plays an important role as a bridge to transplantation by removing accumulated toxins from patient plasma, as well as restoring the coagulation profile.
Method
This was a retrospective study on critically ill liver disease patients who underwent TPE from January 2012 to September 2015. The data were collected for the analyses of coagulation parameters, liver function tests, renal function tests, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, mortality, and hospital stay.
Results
In the study duration, a total of 45 patients with critical liver disease underwent therapeutic plasma exchange. The TPE resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the bilirubin level, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), serum ferritin level and MELD scores. Higher MELD scores in both pre- and post-TPE were associated with higher mortality during the hospital stay.
Conclusion
The TPE is safe and well-tolerated, and it improves coagulation profile and liver function tests in critically ill liver disease patients, but the overall survival remains low.

Abstract: Oxidative stress and inflammation promote vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). CD33-related Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (CD33rSiglecs) are cell surface proteins that recognize sialic acids inhibit innate immune cell functions. We have shown that Siglec-9 on human neutrophils interact with erythrocyte sialic acids (prominently glycophorin-A (GYPA) to suppress neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that altered sickle erythrocyte membrane sialic acid leads to decreased Siglec-9 binding capability, and thus a decreased neutrophil oxidative burst. SS erythrocytes express significantly more sialic acid than AA erythrocytes (p = 0.02). SS erythrocytes displayed significantly less Siglec-9-Fc binding 39% ± 11 (mean ± SEM) compared to AA erythrocytes 78% ± 5 (p = 0.009). Treatment of AA erythrocytes with sialidase to remove sialic acid decreased binding to 3% ± 7.9 (p ≤ 0.001). When freshly isolated neutrophils were incubated with AA erythrocytes, neutrophils achieved 16% ± 6 of the oxidative burst exhibited by a stimulated neutrophil without erythrocytes. In contrast, neutrophils incubated with SS erythrocytes achieved 47% ± 6 of the oxidative burst (AA versus SS, p = 0.03). Stimulated neutrophils incubated with AA erythrocytes showed minimal NET formation while with SS erythrocytes NETs increased. SS erythrocytes are deficient in binding to neutrophil Siglec-9 which may contribute to the increased oxidative stress in SCD.

Abstract: Introduction
The correct completion of the blood components request form is the starting point to ensure good transfusion care. Many guidelines have been developed to search for hemoglobin values that trigger the need for transfusion and show the importance of Patient Blood Management, a scientific evidence-based approach in processes where transfusion is a possibility, such as in elective surgeries.
Objective
The cross-sectional study aimed to analyze the transfusion requests at a complex orthopedic hospital over a one-year period.
Method
The completion quality was classified as Good, Regular, Bad or Very Bad, according to the information given by the physician. Transfusion medicine professionals analyzed the transfusion indication reported on the request form and classified it as Correct, Not based on Patient Blood Management (PBM), in accordance or not with the institutional Maximum Surgical Blood Order Schedule, Impossible to evaluate due to lack of information on the form, and Incorrect.
Results
The study categorized the completion quality of 2011 requests as Good (8.80%), Regular (9.30%), Bad (72.75%) and Very Bad (9.15%). Analysis of the indications revealed that 54.90% of the requests were in accordance with the current blood transfusion recommendations, and on 23.12% of the forms this field had not been filled out.
Conclusion
The majority of blood components (63%) requests are in tune with current blood transfusion recommendations, despite the great number of incorrectly completed forms; nevertheless, it is mandatory to reach much better appropriateness rates.

Abstract: The X-linked inherited muscle wasting disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is caused by primary abnormalities in the membrane cytoskeletal protein dystrophin, is a multi-system disorder. Highly progressive forms of dystrophinopathy are associated with a complex secondary pathophysiology, including renal dysfunction. It was therefore of interest to carry out a systematic survey of potential proteome-wide changes in the kidney of the established mdx-4cv mouse model of dystrophinopathy. Of 5878 mass spectrometrically identified kidney proteins, 82 versus 142 proteins were shown to be decreased or increased, respectively, in association with muscular dystrophy. The most decreased versus increased protein species are the ACSM3 isoform of mitochondrial acyl-coenzyme A synthetase and the FABP1 isoform of fatty acid binding protein, respectively. Both proteomic findings were verified by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analysis. Interestingly, haematoxylin/eosin staining indicated diffuse whitish deposits in the mdx-4cv kidney, and an increased intensity of Sudan Black labelling of kidney cells revealed ectopic fat deposition. Although the proteomic results and cell biological findings do not demonstrate a direct functional link between increased FABP1 and fat accumulation, the results suggest that the up-regulation of FABP1 may be related to abnormal fat metabolism. This makes FABP1 potentially a novel pathobiochemical indicator for studying kidney abnormalities in the mdx-4cv model of dystrophinopathy.

Abstract: Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease commonly associated with hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenias. Progressive cytopenias may be interpreted as an indication of advanced disease and suggest the need to start Gaucher disease specific treatment. As bone marrow evaluation is not routinely performed in Gaucher disease, other causes of cytopenias such as myelodysplastic syndrome a stem cell disorder may be missed. Six patients are described who suffered simultaneously from Gaucher disease and myelodysplastic syndrome, with a discussion of the diagnostic challenges.

Abstract: In this report, dual bandgap CoCo2O4 nanostructured films were spin-coated at different preheat temperatures (PHT) using different solution molarities (SM), Sn doping and La/Sn double doping levels. In addition to chemical compositions, various methods were used to investigate the structural, morphological, roughness, and optical properties. All the films are polycrystalline CoCo2O4, for simplicity Co3O4, spinel (AB2O4) cubic phase. The doping levels of Sn and La/Sn have strongly affected the surface morphologies and roughness parameters. PHT, SM, Sn% and La% show significant changes in lattice parameters, crystallite sizes, transmittance and reflectance spectra. Two bandgaps were detected in the range of 1.3–1.45 eV and 1.72–2.08 eV. With increasing PHT and decreasing SM, the refractive indices decreased and substantially modified with the inclusion of Sn and La in the matrix Co3O4. Among the applied electrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation, the La/Sn-doped Co3O4 photocatalyst displays a catalytic H2 output rate of 134.50 mmol h−1/cm2 @-1Vwith IPCE% of ~52% @ 460 nm. The supreme values of ABPE% are 3.21%@-0.24V and 3.75%@-0.57V, which are the highest values yet for Co3O4-based photocatalysts. Interestingly, this photoelectrode shows photogenerated current densities of ~ −1.57 mA/cm2 at 0 V and −48.42 mA/cm2 at -1V, and photocurrent onset over −0.361 V. The PEC surface areas and Tafel slopes are also studied for the identification of the mechanism of PEC H2 production. The La/Sn doped-Co3O4 photoelectrode has been further tested for stability and reusability. This work has provided a new viewpoint to design highly active Co3O4-based photocatalysts for solar light-driven H2 generation.

Abstract: This cross-sectional study investigated associations between SNPs in metabolizing lipid genes, alpha-thalassemia and laboratory parameters in two forms of sickle cell disease (SCD), sickle cell anemia (SCA) and hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) in a pediatric population. Among the groups SCA and HbSC was found a higher proportion of increased triglycerides (TG) in SCA. High levels of TG were significantly associated with lower hemoglobin (p = 0.006) and HDL-C (p = 0.037), higher white blood cell count (p = 0.027), LDH (p = 0.004) and bilirubins (p < 0.05) in SCD. Patients with HDL-C ≤40 mg/dL had higher markers hemolytic levels. Therapy of HU significantly influenced several hematological and biochemical parameters but not lipid fractions. Genotypes of the APOA5 rs662799 were not associated with lipid levels. The G-risk allele rs964184/ZPRI ZNF259/ZPR1 gene (GC + GG genotypes) was associated with increased levels of TG in children ≥10 years old (p = 0.045) and the atherogenic ratio TG/HDL-C (p = 0.032) in SCD. The use of HU improves levels of hemolysis and inflammation markers in SCD with high TG and, while not interfering with lipid levels, seems to overlap the effect of the G-risk allele in on them. This study reported for the first time that rs964184 SNP could be a genetic modifier of TG in SCD.

Abstract: Aiming at higher cell efficiency and lower Ag consumption, research focuses on achieving smaller finger lines for silicon solar cell front side metallization. In-depth understanding of the printing process is mandatory to achieve uniform, defect free lines with high aspect ratio. An innovative high-speed video imaging setup allows for tracking of the mechanisms happening within ≈10–50 ms during the screen printing process. Two pastes differing significantly with respect to their rheological as well as wetting properties are used in this study. A paste spreading mechanism consisting of different consecutive process steps determines the final line shape. During nip contact the paste is squeezed between screen emulsion and substrate. Paste spreading further proceeds as long as the screen clings to the substrate, it occurs in a regular pattern and is most pronounced in the regions were mesh wires approach the emulsion surface. Then sudden retraction takes place during snap-off and the final line width is essentially fixed. Spreading is more pronounced for the paste exhibiting low viscosity at high shear rates and strong wetting of screen emulsion and substrate. The overall paste transfer is promoted by poor screen wetting and strong paste cohesion. These insights will stimulate further improvement of Ag paste formulation for solar cell metallization.

Abstract: Background
Sickle cell disease is the most common monogenic disorder in humans and is a major public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. In Benin, the prevalence of sickle cell disease is estimated to be 4.8%. Our study aimed to describe the prevalence of hemoglobin abnormalities in an apparently healthy Benin population.
Methods
One thousand four hundred and eighty-three men and women, apparently in good health after medical screening, were tested for hemoglobin abnormalities by hemoglobin electrophoresis and the Emmel test. Subjects who were found to have homozygous or double heterozygous hemoglobin abnormalities, were re-sampled and a confirmation hemogram and hemoglobin electrophoresis test by capillary electrophoresis was performed.
Results
Our study population was predominantly male (97.7%) with an average age of 21.3 years. 1390 subjects reported that they did not know their hemoglobin electrophoresis status. Hemoglobin electrophoresis profiles found were as follows: 1077 (72.6%) AA (normal), 238 (16.1%) AS, 161 (10.9%) AC, 3 (0.2%) SC, 4 (0.2%) CC and 0 (0%) SS. The 406 subjects with abnormal hemoglobin had balanced somatic growth, with general physical examination results showing no abnormalities. In the seven subjects with major sickle cell syndrome or hemoglobinosis (SC and CC), their values of various hemogram parameters were normal apart from the discreet presence of microcytic anemia.
Conclusion
Our study highlights the need for increased routine testing of hemoglobin abnormalities and newborn screening for sickle cell disease in order to enhance early disease detection, prevention and comprehensive care.

Abstract: Summary
A characteristic of multifunctional polymer materials is their complex molecular architecture, which creates a challenge in predicting their degradation behavior. Hence, their appropriate design demands a quantitative correlation between their molecular architecture and their molecular degradation behavior. Here, we present a method to analyze and predict the degradation of such molecules by fast and conclusive Langmuir monolayer experiments in combination with kinetic models. Important findings include the retardation of the degradation in the early stage caused by high molecular weight as well as end caps. In multiblock copolymers consisting of fast- and slow-degrading blocks, the molecular weight and the block length have little effect on degradation behavior. In semicrystalline multiblock copolymers, the degradation rate of amorphous blocks is reduced compared to completely amorphous materials. The reaction rate constants that are obtained by this method are essential for predictive models for the degradation of multifunctional devices.

Abstract: Background
Extracellular vesicles, have gained increasing attention for their application in drug delivery. Here, we developed a novel method for radiolabeling WBCs with 99mTc using RBC-derived extracellular vesicles -mimetics (EVMs), and monitored in vivo inflammation tracking of 99mTc-WBC using gamma camera in acute inflammation mouse model.
Methods
Engineered EVMs from RBCs were produced by a one-step extrusion method. RBC-EVMs were analyzed by NTA and TEM. Cells were labeled with 99mTc by using 99mTc-RBC-EVMs. Inflammation mice model was prepared and confirmed by 18F-FDG PET/CT. 99mTc-WBCs were injected in mice, and their biodistribution was analyzed by gamma camera.
Finding
The radiochemical purity of 99mTc-RBC-EVMs was 100%. The 99mTc-labeling did't affect the size and morphology. The 99mTc in the cytoplasm of RBC-EVMs was successfully confirmed by high angle annular dark field STEM (scanning transmission electron microscope). Cells were successfully labeled with 99mTc using 99mTc-RBC-EVMs, and the counts per minute was increased in dose- and time-dependent manners. The 18F-FDG PET/CT images confirmed establishment of acute inflammation (left mouse foot). 99mTc-WBCs showed higher uptake in the inflamed foot than non-inflamed foot.
Interpretation
This novel method for radiolabeling WBCs using RBC-EVMs. 99mTc labeling may be a feasible method to monitor the in vivo biodistribution of cells.

Abstract: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an inflammatory myeloid neoplasia of children with systemic involvement and poor outcome. The altered RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cell signalling pathway due to somatic mutation of BRAF V600E is the most common genetic abnormality associated with the disease. In the current study, we highlight the frequency of BRAF V600E in our cohort of LCH cases (n = 31) and its relation with clinical outcome. On Real-Time PCR and Sanger sequencing, BRAF V600E was detected in 6/31 (19%) patients. All cases positive for BRAF V600E mutation had multisystem involvement/disseminated disease compared to BRAF mutation negative cases (100% v/s 41%, p = 0.0348). Univariate analysis also revealed significant correlation of mutation positivity with risk category (p = 0.09). The event free survival and overall survival at 36 months for BRAF mutation positive group compared to mutation negative group was 17% v/s 72% (Log rank test p = 0.0110) and 32.5% v/s 82% (p = 0.0330), respectively. In our study, BRAF V600E positivity was low (19%) however, all positive cases had multisystem involvement and a poor three year survival confirming BRAF V600E to be a poor prognostic marker.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Although many effective therapies exist, a substantial portion of patients remain unprotected by current measures. Recent advances in the understanding of the underpinning cause of CVD, atherosclerosis, have demonstrated the important causative role of inflammation in disease progression. Monocytes are important protagonists of atherosclerosis, and they have been shown to have elevated reliance on mitochondrial metabolism producing elevated levels of superoxides as a noxious byproduct. There exists a key link between mitochondrial superoxides production and inflammatory output in monocytes in the context of atherosclerosis. In this review we describe mitochondrial superoxide lowering strategies in order to broaden the scope of treatment strategies for CVD. We further explore strategies for more effective and selective targeting of the involved monocytes and macrophages in order to increase potency of effect and diminish side effects.

Abstract: During the orthodontic tooth movement, cells in periodontal ligament could differentiate into osteoblasts to synthesize alveolar bone as well as affect the proliferation, migration and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, which also contribute to bone remodeling. However, the mechanism is still largely elusive. Here, we evaluated the expression of CREB at the tension site of mouse periodontal ligament under orthodontic mechanical strain and in the cyclic tension strain treated human periodontal ligament cells. Then, through gain and loss of function analysis, we revealed that CREB in PDLCs promotes SDF-1 and FGF2 secretion, which enhance the migration and osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs. We further discovered that CREB transcriptionally activates FGF2 and SDF-1 expressions by binding to the promoter regions.In conclusion, this study confirms that CREB is an upregulated gene in periodontal ligament under orthodontic tension strain stimulation and plays an important role in regulating BMSCs’ physiological activity in orthodontic tension strain-induced bone formation.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the cancer with the highest incidence in childhood and adolescence, and pharmacotherapy is the primary form of treatment.
Objective and methods
A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-asparaginase in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy in children and adolescents was conducted to compare it with native Escherichia coli L-asparaginase. PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Scopus, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) and EMBASE databases were selected. The following outcomes were analyzed: complete remission of the disease, event-free survival, overall survival, anti-asparaginase antibody level, hypersensitivity reactions, asparaginase and asparagine serum levels, number of postdiagnosis events, and overall mortality. Five randomized controlled trials were included. Analysis of the quality of evidence and risk of bias was performed using the Cochrane recommendation tool and the GRADE system.
Results
The assessment results suggest that the level of certainty on the technology addressed is relatively weak from a methodological point of view. Evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes because of the limited number and power of studies and important flaws in their design or conduct in classifying PEG-asparaginase as a superior drug or not, in the pharmacotherapy of ALL in children and adolescents. PEG-asparaginase can be used as a substitute for native E. coli L-asparaginase, demonstrating similar efficacy and safety.
Conclusion
The study may help decision-makers in the public health system to offer a more in-depth judgment on the therapeutic alternatives used to treat this neoplasm in children and adolescents.

Abstract: In this paper, we report on the direct comparison of Al2O3 films deposited by plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) and atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) techniques on the passivation properties of both bare and boron diffused Si surfaces. It is found that ALD and APCVD deposited Al2O3 layers with SiNx capping have very similar chemical composition, hydrogen concentration at the Al2O3/Si interface, and interface defect density (Dit), but the ALD film has slightly higher negative fixed charge (Qf) after a high temperature (~750 °C) contact firing cycle typically used for solar cell fabrication. Both films showed excellent surface recombination velocities of <5 cm/s on planar and textured un-diffused Si wafers, but the ALD films gave 1 to 8 fA/cm2 lower emitter saturation current densities (J0e) on implanted boron emitters with sheet resistance in the range of 90–180 Ω/□. This is attributed to the observed slightly higher negative charge-induced field-effect passivation in the ALD films. However, SiNx/Al2O3/p+/n/n+ passivated emitter rear totally diffused (PERT) cell structures fabricated with 110 and 150 Ω/□ emitter in this study showed no appreciable difference in cell efficiency. Device analysis and simulations showed that even for >23% high-performance solar cells design, with very low bulk and rear contact recombination, the observed small difference in J0e has negligible effect on cell efficiency. Thus, APCVD Al2O3 passivation of B emitter can produce comparable efficiencies to their counterpart ALD Al2O3 passivated n-type Si solar cells.

Abstract: This study was aimed to identify the predictors of splenic sequestration crisis (SSC) among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This prognosis study was carried out in the pediatric immuno-hematology unit, over 20 years (1998 to 2017), enrolling patients with SCD. The cox model was used in multivariate analysis. Among 423 patients with SCD (240 S/S phenotype, 128 S/B0, 30 S/B+, 14 S/O arab and 11 S/C), 150(35.4%) had at least one episode of SSC. The average age of patients at the first episode was 48.3 months ± 32.4(2–168). Recurrence of SSC was observed in 117 patients (78%). Spleen size ≥3 cm at baseline was the strongest predictor of SSC occurrence (HR = 7.27, CI: 4.01–13.20, p = 0.05) and recurrence (HR = 6.37, CI: 1,46–27.83, p = 0.01). Pallor revealing the disease, age at onset of symptoms <24 months and reticulocytosis ≥300,000/mm3 increased the risk of SSC. Pain crisis revealing the disease as well as neutrophilia was associated with a lower risk of SSC. In conclusion, this study confirmed the high prevalence of SSC in SCD and the high frequency of recurrence after a first episode. The SSC occurrence and recurrence were intimately linked to the presence of splenomegaly, chronic pallor revealing the disease as well as reticulocytosis.

Abstract: Krüppel-like factor 4 (Human Protein: KLF4; Human Gene: Klf4; Murine Protein: KLF4; Murine Gene: Klf4) is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor with diverse regulatory functions. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Klf4 exhibit genomic instability, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and decreased autophagy. Elevated ROS is linked to impairments in mitochondrial damage recovery responses and is often tied to disruption in mitochondrial-targeted autophagy known as mitophagy. In this study, we sought to identify a mechanistic connection between KLF4 and mitophagy. Using flow cytometry, we found that Klf4-null MEFs have diminished ability to recover mitochondrial health and regulate ROS levels after mitochondrial damage. Confocal microscopy indicated decreased localization of autophagy protein LC3 to mitochondria following mitochondrial damage in Klf4-null cells, suggesting decreased mitophagy. Western blotting and RT-PCR revealed decreased mRNA and protein expression of the mitophagy-associated protein Bnip3 and antioxidant protein GSTα4 in Klf4-null cells, providing a rationale for their impaired mitophagy and ROS accumulation. Inducing Bnip3 expression in these cells recovered mitophagy but did not decrease ROS accumulation. Our findings suggest that in Klf4-null cells, decreased Bnip3 expression impairs mitophagy and is associated with increased mitochondrial ROS production after mitochondrial damage, providing a rationale for their genomic instability and supports a tumor suppressive role for KLF4 in certain tumors as previously observed.

Abstract: Recently, interfacial solar-driven evaporation has received tremendous attention due to its potential for enhancing solar thermal conversation ability via heat localization at the evaporation interface. Diverse materials and configurations have been explored to boost the evaporation using plastic foam as the thermal insulator at the cost of complex assembly and environmental threats. Herein, we demonstrate a biodegradable, cost-effective, and scalable three-dimensional (3D) cotton paper-based solar steam generator prepared by one-step laser-induced forward transfer in the ambient atmosphere. The as-prepared evaporator has excellent solar absorption ability. The defining advantages of this method are that it can easily form a 3D structure and it is free from hazardous raw material involvement and waste generation. With further novel design by using a natural air gap instead of artificial plastic material to insulate the steam generation area and the underlying bulk water, the as-prepared evaporation system can achieve a high evaporation rate of 1711 g m−2 h−1 with a corresponding efficiency of 83% under one sun illumination. Such solar vaporization functions offer new insights into the future development of high-performance solar steam generators through an environmentally friendly and cost-effective pathway.

Abstract: Tunnel layer passivated contact technology is already highly efficient in case of selective electron extraction but not as efficient in case of selective hole extraction. Thus far, SiOx/p+-poly-Si contacts have resulted only in efficiencies above ~20.1% for rear-side deployed hole selective contacts. We investigate if hole extraction selectivity can be further improved by substituting the ‘conventionally’ used SiOx tunnel layer exhibiting moderate or even high positive fixed charge density by AlOx tunnel layers, exhibiting high negative fixed charge density. The merits of using atomic layer deposited ultrathin AlOx tunnel layers are investigated and compared with wet chemically formed SiOx tunnel layers to form AlOx/p+-poly-Si and SiOx/p+-poly-Si hole selective passivated contacts respectively. The AlOx thickness (0.13–2 nm) and its thermal budget including annealing time, temperature and ambient were varied. The quality of the resulting AlOx/p+-poly-Si passivated contacts was determined by measuring the recombination current density (Jc) and the effective contact resistivity (ρc). Finally, using the measured values of Jc and ρc, we predict the efficiency potential and selectivity of the passivated contact using Brendel's model. We show that for 425 °C annealed AlOx samples prior to poly-Si capping, there is an improvement in passivation quality due to the high negative AlOx interface charge, which forms only for “thick” tunnel layers (≥1.5 nm). However, after high-temperature poly-Si capping, enhanced boron in-diffusion and charge compensation are degrading the overall passivation quality of “thick” AlOx/p+-poly-Si passivated contacts. The best AlOx/p+-poly-Si passivated contacts use ultra-thin AlOx tunnel layers (efficiency potential of 26.9%), which is only marginally better than the SiOx reference samples, but still improves hole selectivity.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate the role of hsa_circ_0008934 in osteosarcoma and the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of the occurrence and development of osteosarcoma
Methods
Differentially expressed circRNAs in the osteosarcoma cell lines SaOS2 and MG63 and in the normal human osteoblast cell line hFOB1.19 were identified via next-generation RNA sequencing. The expression and circular morphology of hsa_circ_0008934 were analyzed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. Proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion of SaOS2 and MG63 cells with hsa_circ_0008934 silencing or overexpression were assessed using the MTS method, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and the transwell system, respectively. The subcellular distribution of hsa_circ_0008934 was revealed via fluorescence in situ hybridization. The binding of hsa_circ_0008934 with microRNAs was confirmed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. The oncogenic roles of hsa_circ_0008934 in osteosarcoma were determined using an in vivo tumorigenesis assay with nude mice. qRT-PCR, western blotting, TUNEL assay, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect the tumorigenicity of hsa_circ_0008934 in osteosarcoma cells.
Results
Many circRNAs were differentially expressed in SaOS2 and MG63 cells than in hFOB1.19 cells. Hsa_circ_0008934 expression was significantly elevated in SaOS2 and MG63 cells. Hsa_circ_0008934 silencing significantly reduced proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, blocked cell cycle progression, and impaired migration and invasion capacities of SaOS2 cells. Opposite cellular alterations were achieved by overexpressing hsa_circ_0008934 in MG63 cells. Hsa_circ_0008934 was mainly distributed in the cytosol and positively regulated E2F3 expression in osteosarcoma cells. In addition, it directly bound with miR-145−5p to repress E2F3 expression and enhanced the tumorigenesis of MG63 cells in nude mice. qRT-PCR revealed that the intracellular injection of hsa_circ_0008934 lentivirus resulted in hsa_circ_0008934 overexpression and miR-145−5p downregulation. Western blotting confirmed that E2F3 was upregulated. Moreover, the TUNEL assay showed that hsa_circ_0008934 overexpression inhibited the apoptosis of tumor cells. IHC detection revealed that the hsa_circ_0008934 overexpression could promote the expression of Ki67 and PCNA.
Conclusion
Elevated hsa_circ_0008934 expression promotes the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells by sponging miR-145−5p to enhance E2F3 expression.

Abstract: Summary
The development of sustainable CO2 capture technologies is critical to address issues associated with global warming. In this context, the concept of an electrochemically driven proton concentration process is developed for the capture of CO2 based on modulation of the proton concentration in an electrochemical cell by a proton intercalating MnO2 electrode. The pH sensitivity of CO2 hydration is leveraged such that CO2 is absorbed as bicarbonate and carbonate ions at high pH values and desorbed as gas at low pH values. The electrochemical work requirement for the proposed proton concentration process to desorb CO2 captured from a flue gas stream is estimated to be 33.2 kJe/mol CO2, suggesting that this process is competitive with other similar electrochemical-based approaches. The experimental results show that the generated current in a symmetrical electrochemical cell with fabricated electrodes is effectively translated into proton intercalation/deintercalation reactions through reversible cycles, resulting in modulated proton concentrations.

Abstract: In this study, the appropriate nano-porous magnesium aluminate spinel was synthesized by self-combustion route, explored for the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue remained in the wastewater. The effects of gel preparation pH and calcination temperature on the spinel structural characteristics and solar photocatalytic activity were investigated by response surface method. The maximum removal efficiency was achieved by the gel preparation in the acidic environment, pH: 2, followed by calcination at 700 °C. The flame-type combustion showed the key role in the advancement of photoactivity due to nitrogen doping in the structure of partially crystalline spinel. The produced composite displayed a nano-porous structure with average pore diameter of 5 nm. Approximately, 90% of contaminant was removed in 40 min under the solar irradiation. The removal rate seems to be dependent of initial dye concentration, < 20 mg l-1, increased linearly up to maximum value. However, the reusability of spinel was limited by dye concentration. The low fabrication cost provided a promising pathway for the wastewater treatment under solar irradiation and demonstrated the suitability of synthesized spinel for the removal of cationic dye.

Abstract: This paper elaborates the compatibility of SS316L alloy with LiNaK carbonate for concentrated solar power plant applications. In this study, corrosion behavior and corrosion mechanism of SS316L in the eutectic LiNaK carbonate molten salt, at 600 °C and 700 °C, were investigated in detail. The results revealed that the corrosion process of stainless steel 316L in the LiNaK carbonate molten salt is mainly divided into four successive steps: (i) selective oxidation process of metals → (ii) lithiation reaction of the oxide → (iii) formation of a dual-structured corrosion scale → (iv) separation and spalling of corrosion products. Moreover, increasing temperature to 700 °C results in a severe corrosion of SS316L in the molten carbonate salt. Therefore, it is imperative to explore a suitable protective coating for SS316L to use it as a structural material in concentrated solar power plant.

Abstract: Objective
Cytomegalovirus infection and disease are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of cytomegalovirus infection and characterize the patients who developed the disease.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was performed among adult patients, recipients of allogeneic HSTC between 2008 and 2015. Taking into account the institutional protocol of prophylaxis infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, patients received either preemptive therapy or prophylaxis with valganciclovir. Infection was defined as a positive pp65 antigenemia assay or PCR higher than 500copies/mL. Disease was defined as viremia with evidence of end organ damage.
Results
Seventy patients were included, the median age was 36 years old (IQR 17–62). A total of 93% of the recipients had a positive serology. The Cytomegalovirus infection occurred in 59% of the patients. Eleven patients developed disease (16%), the most frequent manifestation being colitis, followed by pneumonitis and a single case of retinitis. There were no differences between the preemptive therapy or prophylaxis groups. The mean time of onset of the disease was day 94 post-transplant. Three patients developed disease with a viral load lower than 1000copies/mL.
Conclusion
The incidence of cytomegalovirus infection after transplantation at our institution is high. It was found that the disease can occur with any level of viral load and is associated with high mortality.

Abstract: The performance of OPV module is strongly dominated by the innovating materials and state of the art processes. Herein, we present a large-area and solution-processable OPV module, which the non-fullerene based active layer and interlayers are all deposited by blade coating. The module achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.5% under 100 mW/cm2 AM1.5G irradiation with an active area of 216 cm2 on a 30 cm by 20 cm substrate. The power output can still maintain about 92.5% of the initial performance after 610 h of light soaking under 10000 lux LED irradiation. To the best of knowledge, it is the record high efficiency by far for OPV module with an active area over a hundred square centimeters.

Abstract: Background and objective
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in children represents a high-risk disease. There is a lack of studies assessing the outcome of T-ALL in Hispanic populations, in which it is a rare malignancy. We report the characteristics and results of treatment for childhood T-cell ALL in children over 14 years at a Latin American reference center.
Material and methods
From January 2005 to December 2018, there occurred the analysis of twenty patients ≤ 16 years of age from a low-income open population diagnosed at a university hospital in Northeast Mexico. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment regimens and outcomes were assessed by scrutinizing clinical records and electronic databases. Diagnosis was confirmed by flow cytometry, including positivity for CD-2, 5, 7 and surface/cytoplasmic CD3. Survival rates were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Results
There was a male preponderance (70 %), with a 2.3 male-to-female ratio (p =  .074), the median age being 9.5 years. Leucocytes at diagnosis were ≥ 50 × 109/L in 13 (65 %) children, with CNS infiltration in 6 (30 %) and organomegaly in 10 (50 %). The five-year overall survival (OS) was 44.3 % (95 % CI 41.96–46.62), significantly lower in girls, at 20.8 % (95 % CI 17.32–24.51) vs. 53.1 % (95 % CI 50.30–55.82), (p = .035) in boys; there was no sex difference in the event-free survival (EFS) (p = .215). The survival was significantly higher after 2010 (p = .034).
Conclusion
The T-cell ALL was more frequent in boys, had a higher mortality in girls and the survival has increased over the last decade with improved chemotherapy and supportive care.

Abstract: Summary
Inorganic semiconductor Sb2(S,Se)3 possesses a suitable bandgap, environmentally benign elemental composition, and excellent stability, offering ample promise for next-generation low-cost solar cells. Here, we demonstrate that perovskite quantum dots (QDs), including CH3NH3PbBr3 and CsPbBr3, can serve as highly efficient and air-stable hole extraction materials in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. Through a proper pre-treatment of the colloidal QDs, a 25-nm-thick QD film can be obtained with excellent uniformity and charge transport properties. Spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical analysis show that perovskite QDs can effectively extract holes from Sb2(S,Se)3 with suppressed carrier recombination. The perovskite QDs/Sb2(S,Se)3 heterojunction also establishes an increased built-in potential so that open-circuit voltage is pronouncedly enhanced. Finally, the device based on perovskite QDs/Sb2(S,Se)3 heterojunction boosts the efficiency from 4.43% to 7.82%, setting a record value, to the best of our knowledge, in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. Our research manifests another application of perovskite materials and practical strategy toward efficiency improvement of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.

Abstract: Introduction
Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) has shown impressive response rates for the treatment of CD19 + B-cell malignancies in numerous clinical trials. The CAR molecule, which recognizes cell-surface tumor-associated antigen independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), is composed by one or more signaling molecules to activate genetically modified T cells for killing, proliferation, and cytokine production.
Objectives
In order to make this treatment available for a larger number of patients, we developed a simple and efficient platform to generate and expand CAR-T cells.
Methods
Our approach is based on a lentiviral vector composed by a second-generation CAR that signals through a 41BB and CD3-ζ endodomain.
Conclusions
In this work, we show a high-level production of the lentiviral vector, which was successfully used to generate CAR-T cells. The CAR-T cells produced were highly cytotoxic and specific against CD19+ cells in vitro and in vivo, being able to fully control disease progression in a xenograft B-cell lymphoma mouse model. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of producing CAR-T cells in an academic context and can serve as a paradigm for similar institutions. Nevertheless, the results presented may contribute favoring the translation of the research to the clinical practice.

(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531137919301403)
Abstract: Background
The classical BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). In developing countries, there are few reports that truly reveal the clinical setting of these patients. Therefore, we aimed to characterize a single center MPN population with a special focus on the correct diagnosis based on the recent review of the WHO criteria for the diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms.
Methods
This retrospective study analyzed data from medical records of patients with classical BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs diagnosed from January 1997 to October 2017 and followed at the University Hospital of Ribeirão Preto Medical School.
Results
A total of 162 patients were assessed, 61 with PV, 50 with ET, and 51 with PMF. The mutational status analysis revealed that 113 (69.3%) harbored the JAK2V617F mutation, 23 (14.1%), the CALR mutation, and 12 (7.4%) had a triple-negative status. None of the patients were found to have mutations on the thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL), including some ET and PMF patients who were not tested. Among the PV patients, 57 (93.5%) were positive for the JAK2V617F mutation, one (1.6%) presented an in-frame deletion JAK2 exon 12 mutation and one (1.6%) presented a missense JAK2 exon 9 mutation, not previously described. The overall survival was lower in the triple-negative patients with PMF, when compared to the JAK2V617F or CALR-mutated (p = 0.002).
Conclusion
The frequency of somatic mutations and survival in our cohort, stratified according to the respective disease, was consistent with the literature data, despite some limitations. Further prospective epidemiological studies of MPN cohorts are encouraged in developing countries.

Abstract: The marked pro-thrombotic tendency in PNH is likely to be at least partly due to the population of platelets derived from the abnormal stem cell clone. However, identification of GPI (−) platelets by flow cytometry can be technically difficult. Here we describe a technique that involves the addition of aspirin immediately after the separation of platelet rich plasma and the use of gel filtration to isolate platelets away from plasma proteins and other blood cells. In a study of 92 analyses of samples from 50 patients, we have demonstrated that the percentage of PNH platelets correlates well with the percentage of PNH granulocytes. We also provide data on several cases where there was an extreme discrepancy between the proportion of PNH granulocytes and red cells; in these cases, the demonstration of abnormal platelets suggests that the patient is likely to be at risk of thrombosis. We believe this test will be potentially useful in the evaluation of samples from such patients and may serve as a tool to investigate the causes of hypercoagulability in PNH.

Abstract: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital erythroid aplasia, underlied by haploinsufficient mutations in genes coding for ribosomal proteins (RP) in approximately 70% of cases. DBA is frequently associated with somatic malformations, endocrine dysfunction and with an increased predisposition to cancer. Here we present clinical and genetic characteristics of 62 patients from 52 families enrolled in the Czech and Slovak DBA Registry. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) were employed to identify causative mutations in newly diagnosed patients and in cases with previously unrecognized molecular pathology. RP mutation detection rate was 81% (50/62 patients). This included 8 novel point mutations and 4 large deletions encompassing some of the RP genes. Malignant or predisposing condition developed in 8/62 patients (13%): myelodysplastic syndrome in 3 patients; breast cancer in 2 patients; colorectal cancer plus ocular tumor, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma each in one case. These patients exclusively harbored RPL5, RPL11 or RPS19 mutations. Array CGH is beneficial for detection of novel mutations in DBA due to its capacity to detect larger chromosomal aberrations. Despite the importance of genotype-phenotype correlation in DBA, phenotypic differences among family members harboring an identical mutation were observed.

Abstract: Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, a neglected illness that affects millions of people worldwide, especially in Latin America. The balance between biochemical pathways triggered by the parasite and host cells response will ultimately define the progression of a life-threatening disease, justifying the efforts to understand cellular mechanisms for infection restrain. In this interaction, parasite and host cells are affected by different physiological responses as autophagy modulation, which could be under intense cellular stress, such as nutrient deprivation, hormone depletion, or infection. Autophagy is a constitutive pathway that leads to degradation of macromolecules and cellular structures and may induce cell death. In Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the relevance of host autophagy is controversial regarding in vitro parasite intracellular life cycle. In the present study, we evaluated host cell autophagy during T. cruzi infection in phagocytic and non-professional phagocytic cells. We described that the presence of the parasite increased the number of LC3 puncta, a marker for autophagy, in cardiac cells and peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The induction of host autophagy decreased infection in macrophages in early and late time-periods. We suggest that starved phagocytic cells reduced internalization, also confirmed by inert particles and dead trypomastigotes. Whereas, in cardiac cells, starvation-induced autophagy decreased lipid droplets and infection in later time-point, by reducing parasite differentiation/proliferation. In ATG5 knockout MEF cells, we confirmed our hypothesis of autophagy machinery activation during parasite internalization, increasing infection. Our data suggest that host autophagy downregulates T. cruzi infection through impairing parasite intracellular life cycle, reducing the infection in primary culture cells.

Abstract: Directional solidification of a cast mono silicon seed and of a float-zone (FZ) silicon seed was performed and the grain and defect structures of the seeds as well as of the regrown parts are analyzed. In situ X-ray diffraction imaging enabled the observation of the dislocation arrangements. During the heating process, in the FZ seed, mobile dislocations glide on {111} planes, whereas in the cast mono seed dislocations are arranged in a mainly immobile cellular structure. Ex situ grain orientation mappings reveal the presence of subgrains with misorientations up to 3° in the regrown part of the cast mono-seeded sample, which are not observed in the regrown part of the FZ-seeded sample. Subgrain boundaries characterized by misorientations around the [001] growth axis propagate roughly along the growth axis and increase their misorientation by merging with new subgrain boundaries appearing in their vicinity. Although the first inception of subgrain formation cannot be revealed, the comparison of the dislocation arrangements in the two seeds strongly suggests an influence of the latter on subgrain formation. In the regrown part, interactions between subgrain boundaries and twin boundaries show that they can follow Σ3{111} and Σ9{221} grain boundaries or cross Σ3{111} grain boundaries. Whether Σ3{111} GBs are crossed or not depends among other things on the orientation of the grains on either side of the twin. It demonstrates that the grain orientation relationship and not only the grain boundary character play an important role in the subgrain structure evolution and redistribution in a multicrystalline silicon ingot.

Abstract: People with sickle cell disease often report severe bone pain with repeated bouts of vaso-occlusive crises, but the extent of skeletal injury incurred during these painful episodes remain unclear. We sought to quantify bone degradation by comparing urinary concentrations of carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1), a well-described marker of bone resorption, in a prospective cohort of 52 adults with sickle cell disease enrolled in the Sickle Cell Pain Markers Study. We also questioned if changes in urinary CTX-1 concentrations correlated with changes in hemolysis and inflammatory markers measured both during and after resolution of a painful vaso-occlusive episode. Thirty-one of the 52 adults enrolled in the study had paired urine samples for CTX-1 analysis. Urinary CTX-1, corrected for urine creatinine, significantly decreased from a mean of 3.45 μg/mmol during vaso-occlusive crises to 2.62 μg/mmol at recovery (p = 0.01). Thus, increased bone loss appears to correlate with acute vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. Our finding that urinary CTX-1 can be used to probe bone degradation in sickle cell disease provides an important new tool for diagnosing and monitoring response to therapy for people with sickle cell-related bone loss.

Abstract: Solar cells with polysilicon-based passivating and carrier selective contacts are in the nascent stages of industrialization. Advances in commercially available metallization pastes are necessary to further improve the efficiency of industrial polysilicon-based solar cells and approach the best-reported lab efficiency of such cells. In this work, we have analyzed the front and rear screen-printed metallization of large-area n-type monoPolyTM cells with rear-side low-pressure chemical vapor deposited (LPCVD) polysilicon. Metallization pastes specifically optimized for contacting poly-Si layers are used in this work. The metallization is evaluated by studying its impact on the solar cell performance and by further electrical and optical characterization. An efficiency improvement of 0.5% absolute is demonstrated due to improvements in metallization pastes with a 23% champion cell efficiency (cell area: 244.3 cm2, busbarless metallization). An analysis of the fabricated cells indicates that the efficiency is currently limited by recombination at the front surface, both at the passivated and the metallized regions.

Abstract: In this paper, the effect of temperature on the process of optical degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells is studied. First, we promote the theory of the degradation process we have already presented, which leads to more accurate results. Previously, in the proposed model, we had considered the density of the vacancies distributed in the perovskite layer to be constant, while in reality, their density changes over time. In order to obtain the electric field resulting from the migration of vacancies, which is, in fact, the cause of the optical degradation of the perovskite solar cells, we need the initial density of the vacancies and its temperature dependence as well as migration energy (potential barrier against the migration) of the vacancies. Using the Gibbs free energy resulting from the formation of the vacancies, the density of the vacancies is obtained. Also, by calculating the changes in electrostatic energy between the lattice ions during displacement, the migration energy is obtained. When the required parameters are presented, the temperature dependence of the optical degradation process is discussed using the proposed theory, and the results show the appropriate accuracy of this theory.

Abstract: Summary
For a sustainable hydrogen economy, large-scale transportation and storage of hydrogen becomes increasingly important. Typically, hydrogen is compressed or liquified, but both processes are energy intensive. Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) present a potential solution for mitigating these challenges while making use of the existing fossil fuel transportation infrastructure. Here, we present a process intensification strategy for improved LOHC dehydrogenation and an example of clean power generation using solid oxide fuel cells. Four LOHC candidates—ammonia, biphenyl-diphenylmethane eutectic mixture, N-phenylcarbazole, and N-ethylcarbazole—have been compared as stand-alone and integrated systems using comprehensive process simulation. “Temperature cascade” dehydrogenation was shown to increase the energy generated per unit mass (kWh/kg LOHC) by 1.3–2 times in an integrated system compared to stand-alone LOHC systems, thus providing a possibility for a positive impact on a LOHC-based hydrogen supply chain.

Abstract: Solar steam generation based on light absorbing materials has been considered to be one of the most effective methods to alleviate the problem of water shortage. Herein, a novel 3D network structure and hydrophobic Ni-G-WO3-x evaporator is prepared for steam generation by CVD and solvothermal method. The Ni-G-WO3-x has high optical absorption of 93% from UV to NIR region due to the multi-scattering of the porous Ni and the strong light absorption ability of the Graphene and the WO3-x. The surface temperature of the evaporator can increase from room temperature to 46.8 °C within 4 min under 1 sun illumination, the ultrafast solar-thermal response demonstrates the excellent light absorption ability of Ni-G-WO3-x, which is beneficial for further solar energy conversion efficiency performance. The evaporation rate can reach at 2.12 kg m−2 h−1 with the evaporation efficiency of 85% under one sun illumination. The hydrophobic property of the Ni-G-WO3-x makes the evaporator have an outstanding cycle stability. Also, the evaporator shows excellent seawater desalination and sewage treatment ability. Moreover, the outdoor experiment illustrates that the evaporator has practical applications under natural sunlight conditions. Excellent photo-thermal conversion ability, high efficiency and reusability of the evaporator are suitable for a wide range of practical applications in solar desalination and sewage treatment.

Abstract: Radiative cooling is becoming more popular in various applications since the heat is dissipated passively with zero energy consumption. Radiative cooling for metallic substrates was developed in this study via electrophoretic deposition of a chitosan layer. The tailored optical properties, generality to different metals, and the cost-effectiveness of the employed fabrication facility are described. The deposited areas are scalable without requiring high-precision lithography, and the chitosan itself has trivial environmental impacts. The addition of the chitosan layer increased the thermal emissions of stainless steel and platinum substrates by 52.4 W/m2 (approximately ninefold) and 51.5 W/m2, respectively. The durability of the cooling performance was validated after sunlight exposure. The sample temperature decreased during the daytime by up to 2.4 °C under high humidity, and reached 4.4 °C in dry surroundings. The feasibility of using an ecofriendly material for scalable radiative cooling has been experimentally demonstrated.

Abstract: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast synaptic transmission in muscles and autonomic ganglia and regulate cytokine and neurotransmitter release in the brain and non-excitable cells. The α7 nAChRs localized in the outer membrane of mitochondria regulate cytochrome c release stimulated by apoptosis-inducing agents. However, the mechanisms through which nAChRs influence mitochondrial permeability remain obscure. Here we put an aim to explore the interaction of nAChRs with voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC1) and pro-apoptotic protein Bax in the course of apoptosis induction. By using molecular modeling in silico, it was shown that both Bax and VDAC1 can bind within the 4th transmembrane portion (M4) of nAChR subunits. Experimentally, α7 nAChR-Bax and α7 nAChR-VDAC1 complexes were identified by sandwich ELISA in mitochondria isolated from astrocytoma U373 cells. Stimulating apoptosis of U373 cells by H2O2 disrupted α7-VDAC complexes and favored formation of α7-Bax complexes accompanied by cytochrome c release from mitochondria. α7-selective agonist PNU282987 or type 2 positive allosteric modulator PNU120596 disrupted α7-Bax and returned α7 nAChR to complex with VDAC1 resulting in attenuation of cytochrome c release. It is concluded that mitochondrial nAChRs regulate apoptosis-induced mitochondrial channel formation by modulating the interplay of apoptosis-related proteins in mitochondria outer membrane.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) and has become the subject of several studies to understand and treat it.
Objective
This study does a descriptive analysis of the apoptotic index (AI) evaluation and intestinal permeability (IP) alterations in association with the clinical, endoscopic and histopathological data on patients undergoing AHSCT, with emphasis on acute intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) diagnosis.
Methods
Thirty-one patients were divided into two groups—one of patients with a clinical GVHD diagnosis and one of those without GVHD diagnosis.
Results
Thirteen deaths (41.9%) occurred during the study period, thereby reaffirming the severity of the alterations found in the patients. Fifteen patients subjected to 21 esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedures prior to D + 90 post-transplant had visible endoscopic alterations and 19 biopsies revealed histological alterations to the stomach and duodenum. Higher apoptotic indices, not reaching statistical significance, were observed in patients who died of graft versus host disease (GVHD), in the more acute forms of GVHD and where clinical GVHD was present. The intestinal permeability evaluation was performed on nine patients able to undergo it in the three proposed study periods, which showed alterations, some of which were pronounced even during pre-transplant and, therefore, the pre-conditioning phase.
Conclusion
Clinical judgment remains a fundamental tool in the diagnosis of GVHD. This study points to the known limitations of traditional diagnostic aids (endoscopy and histology) and points to new methods not usually employed in clinical practice.

Abstract: Summary
The performance and lifetime of a solar cell is sensitive to its operating temperature. In applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics, an accurate knowledge of the total hemispherical emittance as a function of temperature is required to calculate total radiative heat transfer and hence solar cell operating temperature. Here, we report a direct and absolute calorimetric method based on Stefan-Boltzmann’s law for determining total hemispherical emittance of a surface. This method is applied to measure front and rear total hemispherical emittance of silicon and perovskite solar cells with and without encapsulation. Results show that the encapsulation material and the type of rear electrode strongly influence the emittance of the cell. Additionally, total hemispherical emittance values of solar cells determined in this work are considerably lower than spectral emittance values previously measured. These findings demonstrate the importance of front and rear materials selection in the optimization of radiative cooling for efficiency and lifetime.

Abstract: Introduction
Patients with benign or malignant blood disorders, who require allogeneic stem cell transplantation and lack an identical human leukocyte antigen HLA identicalHL sibling donor, could be transplanted with hematopoietic stem cells from unrelated adult or umbilical cord donors. However, in our country, both approaches are costly and time-consuming options.
Methods
Over the last few years, haploidentical modalities have been investigated as an alternative donor source, showing similar results to those obtained with identical HLA donors. We started using T-cell-replete haploidentical with post-transplant cyclophosphamide in 2012 and we presented our experience with patients undergoing haploidentical ransplantation compared to SIB.
Results
Since January 2012 to date, 91 allogeneic transplants have been performed, of which 49 were haploidentical and 42 were HLA identical. The mean age of the patients was 35 years (range: 17–62). The mean CD34/kg×106 infused per group was 5.93 and 5.89, respectively. Time to granulocyte and platelet engraftment was 11 and 15 days, respectively, for haploidentical, and 12 and 14 days, respectively, for HLA identical (p=0.10). The 100-day cumulative incidence of global acute GVHD was 34% for haploidentical and 29% for SIHLA identical (p=0.9). The 2-year overall global graft-versus-host disease was 43% for haploidentical and 41% for HLA identical (p=0.8). Overall survival, relapse, and transplant and relapse-related mortality were similar between both groups.
Conclusion
Our experience showed that haploidentical has similar outcomes to those obtained with HLA idential and can be performed in our country safely.

Abstract: Four Moroccan local industrial wastes were identified as potential high temperature (up to 1000 °C) thermal energy storage (TES) materials for application in solar tower power plants. These wastes are namely induction furnace slag (IFS) from the metallurgical industry, and three solid wastes from the coal-fired power plant industry (i.e. coal fly ashes (CFA), coal bottom ashes (CBA), and coal bottom clinker (CBC)). In the present paper, these wastes would be used as raw materials to develop/synthesize novel low-cost high-temperature TES materials for the same application. The main motive of this work is to manufacture enhanced versions of the selected wastes in order to eliminate their main points of weakness, i.e.: (1) their glassy form which restricts their structural strengths, (2) transform the wastes in the form of powder into solid crystalline materials with improved TES properties, and in the desired regular shapes. To fulfill this aim, a summary of the results of the different conducted characterizations on the four raw materials is presented. Then, the used synthesis method is described from the preparation of the raw materials formulations to the obtained final products. Finally, a laboratory experimental investigation was conducted on these obtained materials in order to assess their potential for TES application up to 1000 °C. Thus, their structural and thermophysical properties were evaluated, as well as their thermal stability up to 1000 °C. The obtained results suggest that most of the synthesized materials are good candidate materials for high-temperature thermal energy storage application (up to 1000 °C).

Abstract: Mastocytosis is a mast cell disease caused by functionally defective infiltrating mast cells and CD34+ mast cell precursors. The heterogeneous group of mast cell disorders is categorized into five variants in the updated 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification among those systemic mastocytosis with an associated neoplasm (SM-AHN). Except for myeloid neoplasia, lymphoproliferative disorders associated to SM-AHN are more scarce. Here, we report the second case ever described of associated mastocytosis and hairy-cell disease. A 38-year-old female patient without any specific medical history was diagnosed a hairy cell leukemia and BRAFV600E mutation was found in hairy cells. Since purine-analogs were avoided to prevent prolonged myelosuppression, she was treated with vemurafenib and rituximab. Despite early discontinuation due to vemurafenib-induced agranulocytosis, a partial response was observed. Strikingly, bone marrow biopsy performed one month after vemurafenib discontinuation revealed a nodular infiltration by 30% tumoral mastocytes. Along with elevated tryptase level, KITD816V mutation on mastocytes and clinical exam, the patient was diagnosed with systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN). No BRAFV600E mutation was found on mastocytes. The physiopathology of this association is not known and might be only a coincidence or a common genetic driver mutation enhancing mast and hairy cells.

Abstract: Introduction
Ruxolitinib has been approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF). In this study, we present safety and efficacy findings from an analysis of 104 patients with intermediate- and high-risk MF in a Brazilian cohort of the JUMP study who received treatment with ruxolitinib.
Methods
JUMP is a single-arm, open-label, phase IIIb, expanded-access study. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the safety and tolerability (frequency, duration, and severity of adverse events [AEs]) of ruxolitinib.
Results
All of the 104 patients received the treatment. Median duration of exposure was 35.8 months. The most common hematologic AEs were anemia (57.7), thrombocytopenia (38.5%), neutropenia (11.5%), and leukopenia (9.6%). Second malignancies (all grades) occurred in 19.2% of patients (n=20). Serious AEs were reported in 62.5% of patients (n=65). The proportions of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in palpable spleen length at weeks 24 and 48 were 62.7% and 69.2%, respectively. The mean change from the baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Lymphoma total score was 10.8 [15.6%] at week 4, 12.6 [14.1%] at week 24, and 12.2 [14.3%] at week 48. The mean change from the baseline for the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale was 3.9 [42.8%] at week 4, 4.9 [29.9%] at week 24, and 4.7 [28%] at week 48. At week 48, the estimated progression-free survival, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival probabilities were 91%, 91% and 93%, respectively Overall, 21 deaths were observed in the present study.
Conclusion
Findings from this study suggest that ruxolitinib could be evaluated as a standard-of-care treatment for the MF population in need of a viable treatment option. NCT01493414

Abstract: Objective
To develop a self-reporting questionnaire, namely the Blood Donor Satisfaction Questionnaire (BDSQ) in Brazilian Portuguese, to assess the blood donor satisfaction with the service provided by a blood bank.
Method
This study was carried out in three stages: 1) a preliminary version of the instrument was proposed, based on a revision of a previous questionnaire and consideration of the focus groups blood donor perceptions; 2) a content validation to assess the relevance of the items, clarity, domain structure and comprehensiveness of the satisfaction measurement, and; 3) a pre-test of the instrument using a sample of blood donors. All the stages of the research were performed at the Regional Hemotherapy Center in Franca, São Paulo, Brazil.
Results
The 25-item BDSQ being proposed has an additional question on overall satisfaction. Responses to items are presented on a five-point scale, including a neutral answer. The BDSQ has three domains: accessibility and convenience, technical aspects, and interpersonal aspects.
Conclusion
The application of the BDSQ has shown that it can be a useful tool in generating information for managers on specific aspects of blood bank services which need to be improved, monitored or maintained, aiming to provide a service which meets the blood donor expectations and makes him or her feel satisfied with the care received.

Abstract: Ras Guanine Exchange Factor (RasGEF) domain family member 1b is encoded by a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-inducible gene expressed in macrophages, but transcriptional mechanisms that govern its expression are still unknown. Here, we have functionally characterized the 5′ flanking Rasgef1b sequence and analyzed its transcriptional activation. We have identified that the inflammation-responsive promoter is contained within a short sequence (-183 to +119) surrounding the transcriptional start site. The promoter sequence is evolutionarily conserved and harbors a cluster of five NF-κB binding sites. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the promoter is responsive to TLR activation and RelA or cRel, but not RelB, transcription factors. Besides, site-directed mutagenesis showed that the κB binding sites are required for maximal promoter activation induced by LPS. Analysis by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) revealed that the promoter is located in an accessible chromatin region. More important, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed that RelA is recruited to the promoter region upon LPS stimulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Finally, studies with Rela-deficient macrophages or pharmacological inhibition by Bay11-7082 showed that NF-κB is required for optimal Rasgef1b expression induced by TLR agonists. Our data provide evidence of the regulatory mechanism mediated by NF-κB that facilitates Rasgef1b expression after TLR activation in macrophages.

Investigation of light-induced degradation in N-Type silicon heterojunction solar cells during illuminated annealing at elevated temperatures,

Abstract: In this paper, we study a light-induced degradation (LID) mechanism observed in commercial n-type silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells at elevated temperatures using dark- and illuminated annealing for a broad range of illumination intensities (1–40 kWm−2) at temperatures from 25 to 180 °C. Three key results are identified. Firstly, an increase in solar conversion efficiency (η) of up to 0.3% absolute is observed after 3 min of dark annealing at 160 °C, attributed to improved surface passivation and a reduction in series resistance. Secondly, a temperature-dependent light-induced degradation behaviour is observed at temperatures as low as 85 °C under 1-sun equivalent illumination, with increasing degradation extent and rate for increasing temperatures. At 160 °C, an average η loss of 0.5 ± 0.3% absolute is observed after only 5 min and exceeding 0.8% in some cells. Thirdly, a subsequent light intensity-dependent recovery occurs with continued illumination exposure. Under 1-sun illumination at 160 °C, a reduction in net η loss up to 0.05 ± 0.1% absolute is observed after 2 h. Increasing the illumination intensity to 40 kWm−2 accelerates the recovery and can result in a net η improvement of 0.2% absolute at 150 °C within 100 s. The results suggest that attempts to improve the efficiency of SHJ solar cells using illuminated annealing could be detrimental to cell performance if not carefully optimised. Further investigation is required to identify the exact nature of the underlying defect mechanism(s) and develop appropriate mitigation strategies on commercially suitable timescales.

Abstract: Background
Bone marrow angiogenesis is increased in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, prompting the rationale for using antiangiogenic drugs in the treatment of these patients.
Objective
To assess angiogenesis in patients with MM at diagnosis and following treatment with an antiangiogenic drug.
Patients and Methods
Twenty-three patients with newly diagnosed MM were treated with thalidomide-based regimens. Bone marrow evaluation was made before and following treatment and included angiogenesis assessment, which was quantified through microvessel density (MVD) determination, by means of anti-CD34 immunohistochemical labeling, and classified either as high MVD or low MVD, according to the mean CD34 count: above or below the median of 12.6.
Results
The pre-therapy median MVD was 12 (7.5–18.3) versus 8.7 (5.35–18.5) post-therapy, p=0.2114.
Conclusions
Our study found no reduction in MVD before and following treatment and, accordingly, we could establish no relationship between MVD and response to therapy in the sample we studied.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) system is a decisive technology for handling intermittent problems, and ensuring the dispatchability of electrical energy from concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Indeed, the integration of a packed-bed TES system in these plants is a promising solution; however, it is also a challenge depending on the choice of storage materials. This system is a dual-media thermocline storage system composed of two phases: solid (storage material) and heat transfer fluid (HTF). At present, the selection process of suitable materials for this TES system remains a very critical issue, as it has to satisfy several criteria related to the storage materials stability and their performances inside the TES component. Within this scope, there have been many reviews of potential sensitive storage media, but there is no available review in the literature concerning natural rocks as potential storage materials at high temperatures, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, the present paper reviews the available data about the previously investigated rocks. This comprehensive effort is divided into four main sections whose the first presents the operating principle of a packed-bed system. Then, the second one concerns the classification of rock types. The third one is entirely devoted to the methodology of rocks selection, as well as to the used equipment and methods for rocks characterization. In addition, the durability and compatibility of rocks with different HTFs are also examined in this section. Finally, the main conclusions, findings, and current research priorities are drawn and summarized in the last section.

Abstract: Enhancing the functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is considered a potential approach for promoting tissue regeneration. In this study, we investigated the effects of Matrix Metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and its mechanism. Our results showed that knockdown of MMP-1 impeded scratch closure, attenuated proliferation, inhibited ALP activity, ALP denser staining and mineralization in vitro, and decreased expression of RUNX2, OSX, OPN and OCN in BMSCs, while 20 ng/mL recombinant human MMP-1 protein (rhMMP-1) significantly accelerated scratch closure, enhanced proliferation, ALP activity, ALP denser staining and mineralization in vitro, and increased expression of RUNX2, OSX, OPN and OCN. In addition, knockdown of MMP-1 inhibited the expression of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) and phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinases (p-ERK), while 20 ng/mL rhMMP-1 increased the expression of p-JNK and p-ERK in BMSCs. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) by their inhibitor SP600125 and PD98059 dramatically blocked MMP-1-enhanced ALP activity and mineralization in BMSCs. Our results revealed that MMP-1 could accelerate the osteogenic differentiation potentials of BMSCs via the JNK and ERK pathway, providing the mechanism underlying MSC biology and identifying a potential target for improving bone tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage at temperatures above 400 °C is critical for efficient industrial processes and continuous solar thermal power generation. Phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for both latent heat storage and improved conversion efficiencies, but their use has been prevented by the large, 5–25 % change in molar volume. Herein, shape-stabilized PCMs are prepared using 20% wt. mesoporous silica matrices and NaCl–NaBr–Na2MoO4 salt eutectic. The pristine salt mixture has a total enthalpy of 216 Jg-1 divided into a solid-solid transition at 455 °C and solid – liquid transition at 522 °C. Six mesoporous silica materials of the MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41), SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous) and mesocellular foam types were investigated as potential matrices for high temperature, shape-stabilized PCMs. All resulting composites have good thermal stability up to 650 °C. High – temperature optical microscopy shows that all samples retain their macroscopic solid shape above the salt melting point. Electron microscopy revealed a good dispersion of the silica matrix inside the molten salt phases. Both MCM-41 and SBA-15-type matrices yield PCMs with high total heat of fusion values between 169 – 178 Jg-1, in accordance to the 80% wt. salt fraction. The melting point is decreased with 5–10 °C for all composite materials, indicating nanoconfinement effects of the interparticle salt phase. This work therefore provides a new strategy for obtaining shape-stabilized materials useful for high – temperature heat storage.

Abstract: Background
The treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has evolved significantly in the past decade, and new drug combinations have improved the response rates and prolonged survival. Studies comparing different induction chemotherapy regimens have shown that triple combinations have better results than double combinations. However, comparisons among different triple combinations are rare in the literature.
Methods
We retrospectively compared two triple combinations comprising bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCD) versus thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CTD), and aimed at identifying which of the two combinations would yield better response rates following four induction cycles prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation in patients with untreated multiple myeloma.
Results
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 311 patients from 24 different centers.The VCD regimen was used as induction therapy by 117 (37.6%) patients, whereas 194 (62.4%) patients received the CTD regimen. After four cycles of induction on an intention-to-treat basis, 54% of the patients in the VCD group achieved at least very good partial response versus 42.8% in the CTD group (p=0.05). We observed no difference in neuropathy or thrombotic events rates among the two regimens.
Conclusion
Our results corroborate the superiority of the triple combination regimes containing bortezomib over the triple combination with thalidomide as pre ASCT induction therapy in MM.

Abstract: Objective
The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of blood donors and the serological profile of the blood donations at the blood bank of the University Hospital Polydoro Ernani de São Thiago of the Federal University of Santa Catarina from January 2011 to December 2016.
Methods
The characteristics of donors and the serological results of the donated blood were compiled from databases. Only donations with a negative serology or a positive serology confirmed by second-sample testing were included in the study.
Results
A total of 14,368 donations were included in the study, of which 118 (0.8%) had a confirmed positive serology. Of the total donations, 94.3% were from spontaneous donations and 5.7% from replacement donation. Donations were predominantly from men (54.1%), individuals aged 18 to 29 years (69.1%), and repeat donors (47.7%). Detection rates were higher for HBV (0.63%), followed by syphilis (0.13%), HIV (0.05%), HCV (0.02%), and Chagas disease (0.01%). With the exception of HIV, positive results were more frequent in the older age groups. Positive results for HBV, HCV, and HIV were more frequent among first-time donors. Replacement donations were more likely to have HBV (OR 7.7; 95% CI 4.9–12.1, p < 0.0001) and HIV (OR 6.7; 95% CI 1.3–34.7; p = 0.02) than spontaneous donations.
Conclusion
This study showed that the frequency of infections in blood donations at the HU-UFSC blood bank was lower than the national estimates and that our population may have a greater prevalence of syphilis among older donors

Abstract: Background
This study aimed to describe the incidence, microbiological profile, and risk factors associated with bacteremia in pediatric patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was performed on patients under 18 years old who underwent HSCT due to any indication, between January 2012 and January 2017. The patient data were collected from the first 100 days post-HSCT. Bacteremia was defined as the isolation of bacteria from at least one blood culture. The relation between bacteremia and associated risk factors was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis.
Results
We enrolled a total of 111 pediatric patients who received HSCT during the period of study. The total number of patients who developed at least one episode of bacteremia was 46 (41.4%), and the total number of bacteremia episodes was 62. Rectal swabs were performed in 44 patients to detect prior colonization and this showed that 25% of them were positive, the main pathogen isolated being carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae. The Gram-negative bacteria cases accounted for 60% of 62 events. The main Gram-negative bacteria isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and the majority were resistant strains. The mortality rate on day +100 for the whole cohort was 18% (n=20). Regarding the patients with bacteremia, the mortality rate on day +100 was 30% (n=14), and the cause of death was related to infection in 10 of them. We did not find any statistically significant risk factor for the development of bacteremia.
Conclusion
Bacteremia is common after HSCT, and there is a high frequency of resistant Gram-negative infections which is related to high mortality.

Abstract: A low erythropoietin (EPO) level is a minor diagnostic criterion for polycythemia vera (PV). Controversies exist regarding the diagnostic value of a low EPO level when considering increasing availability of advanced molecular testing. We assessed the role of low EPO level for PV diagnosis in the context of positive JAK2 mutation status as well as other diagnostic parameters. Of 138 patients, 75 patients had PV and 63 had secondary erythrocytosis. Of the 75 patients with PV, 32% had EPO levels within the normal range. EPO level positively correlated with obesity and smoking status, making it an unreliable diagnostic marker in those patients. Although EPO level below normal as a standalone diagnostic modality was significantly associated with PV (odds ratio [OR] 0.857; p < 0.001), when JAK2V617F mutation status was included in the prediction model, the association of low EPO was not statistically significant (OR 0.962, p = 0.269). Positive JAK2V617F demonstrated a strong predictive value for PV (OR 670.5, p = 0.006) either alone or in combination with other variables. Results show that EPO level is not a reliable diagnostic marker due to physiologic variation in association with obesity and smoking.

Abstract: Background
The osmotic fragility test (OFT), conventionally used for assisting the diagnosis of many erythrocyte disorders, is a manual and time-consuming analysis not daily performed in many medical laboratories. This study was aimed at defining the stability of whole blood samples used for assessing erythrocyte osmotic resistance.
Methods
Twenty-one consecutive routine whole blood samples collected into 5.4 mg K2EDTA were tested immediately after collection (day 0) and at different time intervals afterward (day 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 14) after storage at 4 °C. The OFT was performed with the Osmored Monotest (1.3% glycerol; Eurospital, Trieste, Italy). Results at the different time points were compared with those obtained at day 0 and with the reference change value (i.e., 33%).
Results
The median value of both hyperosmolar and hyposmolar resistance increased from baseline, reaching statistical significance at day 7 for hyperosmolar resistance and at day 1 for hyposmolar resistance, respectively. The median relative increase of hemolysis percentage values become greater than the reference change value at day 3 for hyposmolar resistance, while this limit was never overcome for hyperosmolar resistance. A significant inverse association was found between the mean increase in hyperosmolar resistance and the baseline value of hyperosmolar resistance (r = −0.92), mean corpuscular volume (MCV; r = −0.46) or mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH; r = −0.44), as well as between the mean increase in hyposmolar resistance and the baseline value of hyposmolar resistance (r = −0.86), or patient age (r = −0.56).
Conclusions
The sample stability seems critical for the OFT. Whole blood specimens should not be stored refrigerated at 4 °C for >2 days before testing.

Abstract: Introduction
Hematologists deal every day with high mortality rates of acute leukemia patients. Many times these patients need Intensive Care Unit (ICU) support and some general ICU teams believe that these patients have a much greater chance of dying than patients with other pathologies. In Brazil, data related to mortality rates and ICUs for acute leukemia patients are scarce.
Methods
Therefore, to assess mortality predictors in patients with acute leukemia admitted to a specialized hematological ICU, we evaluated demographics, supportive care, hospitalization time, disease status, admitting diagnosis, neutropenia, number of transfusions and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)/Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores as possible factors associated with mortality. Data were extracted from the first admission records of 110 patients with acute leukemia admitted to the Hemocentro de Pernambuco (Hemope) ICU between 2006 and 2009.
Results
In this retrospective cohort study, 72/110 of the patients were men, and 64/110 were from the metropolitan area of Recife. The patients’ age median was 43.5 years (±17.9); 67.3% had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 32.7% had acute lymphoid leukemia. The main admitting diagnosis in the ICU was sepsis (66.7%). The mean APACHE II score was 18.3. Of the total, 65 (59%) died, and the mortality rate was independently related to longer hospitalization (p<0.001), the increase in the APACHE II score (p<0.038) and having received hemodialysis (p<0.006). Neutropenia, receiving multiple transfusions and using any kind of mechanical ventilation or vasoactive drug on admission were not relevant to mortality. Factors associated with higher mortality rates were: longer hospitalization, increase in the APACHE II score, and use of hemodialysis.
Conclusion
With these data, to prevent organ lesions before admission to the ICU, a better strategy might be to reduce mortality for leukemia patients.

Abstract: Introduction
The impact of splenectomy on venous thrombosis (VTE), abdominal thrombosis (abVTE) and sepsis in autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is unclear.
Methods
Using the California Discharge Dataset 1991–2014, 4756 AIHA patients were identified. Cumulative incidences (CI) of VTE, abVTE, and sepsis were determined in patients with and without splenectomy. Using propensity score matching adjusted for competing risk of death, the association between VTE, abVTE and sepsis with splenectomy was determined.
Results
In those without splenectomy, the CIs of VTE, abVTE, and sepsis were 1.4%, 0.2%, and 4.3% respectively, compared to 4.4%, 3.0% and 6.7% with splenectomy. Splenectomy was associated with increased risk for VTE in immediate (HR 2.66, CI 1.36–5.23) and late (HR 3.29, CI 2.10–5.16) post-operative periods. AbVTE was increased in immediate post-operative period (HR 34.11, CI 4.93–236.11). Sepsis was only increased in late post-operative period (HR 2.20, CI 1.75–2.77). In multivariate models, older age, having >1 comorbidity and having VTE, abVTE, and sepsis were associated with increased mortality. Splenectomy was not associated with increased mortality.
Discussion
Splenectomy in AIHA was associated with significant early thrombotic risk and long-term morbidity. Future research should evaluate the role of splenectomy in AIHA patients, and potential long-term thrombotic and antibiotic prophylaxis.

Abstract: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a common genetic blood disorder, affecting millions worldwide. According to current evidence, individuals with SCA have more than 300 times greater risk to develop bacterial meningitis (BM) than the general population. Herein we have described the characteristics of a series of BM cases in SCA patients in Salvador, Brazil, during 13 years of hospital-based surveillance. Data on clinical presentation, laboratory parameters and outcomes were collected retrospectively by reviewing medical records. From 1999 to 2011, ten SCA patients were identified among the 2511 cases of BM (10/2511; 0.40%). These patients were more likely to be male (90%) and to be younger (median age 8.5 years). The causative agents were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=5) and Haemophilus influenzae (n=1). The most frequent pneumococcal serotypes were 23F (2 cases), 14, 18F, 23B (one case each). Common medical complications were stroke (n=3); heart failure (n=2), respiratory problems (n=2), renal dysfunctions (n=2) and leg ulcers (n=1). This study highlights the importance of S. pneumoniae as a causative agent of meningitis in individuals with SCA and shows the diversity of comorbidities associated with this condition.

Abstract: β-thalassemia (β-Thal) is caused by defective β-globin production leading to globin chain imbalance, aggregation of free alpha chain in developing erythroblasts, reticulocytes, and mature circulating red blood cells. The hypochromic thalassemic red cells exhibit increased cell dehydration in association with elevated K+ leak and increased K-Cl cotransport activity, each of which has been linked to globin chain imbalance and related oxidative stress. We therefore tested the effect of genetic inactivation of K-Cl cotransporters KCC1 and KCC3 in a mouse model of β-thalassemia intermedia. In the absence of these transporters, the anemia of β-Thal mice was ameliorated, in association with increased MCV and reductions in CHCM and hyperdense cells, as well as in spleen size. The resting K+ content of β-Thal red cells was greatly increased, and Thal-associated splenomegaly slightly decreased. Lack of KCC1 and KCC3 activity in Thal red cells reduced red cell density and improved β-Thal-associated osmotic fragility. We conclude that genetic inactivation of K-Cl cotransport can reverse red cell dehydration and partially attenuate the hematologic phenotype in a mouse model of β-thalassemia.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by frequent and unpredictable vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) that lead to severe pain, organ damage, and early death. Lack of reliable biomarkers that objectively define VOEs remains a critical barrier to improving the care for SCD patients. VOEs result from a complex interplay of cell-cell interactions that promote micro-vascular occlusion. Earlier studies demonstrated that sickle erythrocytes are more adherent than non-sickle erythrocytes and established a direct link between adhesion and frequency of VOEs. We developed a standardized, flow-based adhesion bioassay to assess the adhesive properties of SCD blood samples. The current study provides a cross-sectional analysis of steady state adhesion in SCD patients presenting at monthly out-patient hematology visits. Steady state adhesion varied from patient-to-patient. Adhesion positively correlated with reticulocyte percent and WBC count although there was no significant relationship between adhesion and platelets or hemoglobin in this study. Additionally, steady state adhesion indices were significantly lower in SCD subjects receiving hydroxyurea therapy when compared to the untreated group. The well-plate based microfluidic flow adhesion bioassay described in this report may provide a platform to identify SCD subjects with severe disease phenotypes, predict impending VOEs, and monitor response to current and developing therapies.

Abstract: Introduction
Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of the plasma coagulation factors VIII and IX (hemophilia A [HA] and hemophilia B [HB], respectively). Replacement therapy with clotting factor concentrates is the mainstay of treatment. Unlike in patients with HB, anaphylaxis in patients with HA is extremely rare.
Methods
A retrospective study of prospectively collected data on patients with hemophilia who experienced anaphylaxis was conducted in our center. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and laboratory workups that included thrombin generation were conducted.
Results
Our first patient underwent successful immune tolerance induction (ITI) following the administration of rituximab. The second patient was transitioned to emicizumab. The third patient receives recombinant activated VIIa (rFVIIa) on demand. Thrombin generation was performed following current medical management protocols for supporting hemostasis.
Discussion
Our case series illustrates the difficulty in managing patients with anaphylaxis to replacement therapy. In the era of novel therapies, such as emicizumab, the management of HA patients who experience anaphylaxis to replacement therapy is becoming easier and may obviate the need for ITI. Current treatment strategies for HB patients with such anaphylaxis, however, are limited to rFVIIa, and it continues to pose a challenge.

Abstract: Introduction
Molecular analysis in haemophilia is currently used in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this disease. Hispanic populations in Latin America have been of interest to researchers due to the reportedly high prevalence of inhibitors in these patients.
Aim
To perform next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a cohort of Mexican patients with HA and HB and correlate with clinical phenotypes.
Methods
Patients with Haemophilia A (HA) or haemophilia B (HB), were evaluated using NGS with an Ion AmpliSeq Custom Panel. Odds ratios (ORs) for associations between F8 variants and inhibitors were obtained.
Results
A total of 85 patients (60 with HA and 25 with HB) were included. Pathogenic variants in F8 were found in 93.3% of HA patients and in F9 in 96% of HB patients. Twelve novel potentially pathogenic variants were found. Inhibitors were observed in 20% of patients with severe HA. Four patients clinically diagnosed with HA were negative for F8 variants.
Conclusion
Overall detection rate of pathogenic variants in F8 and F9 genes was 94.6%. We identified 12 non previously reported variants and pathogenic variants in other coagulation related genes. Molecular diagnosis of HA and HB permits better options for management, assessment and genetic counseling.

Abstract: Degradation of the encapsulation of solar modules is a crucial problem and, accordingly, tools for assessing and understanding the according degradation is an important research topic. Here, we suggest near-infrared absorption spectroscopy (NIRA) as a tool that has a strong potential to determine non-invasively the composition of encapsulant and backsheet in typical commercial solar modules. Correct polymer identification by NIRA was supported by Raman spectral microscopy of the backsheet air sides and cross sections, with a hundred solar modules of different manufacturers analyzed by both spectroscopic methods. Furthermore, a specific NIRA measurement regime of the ethylene vinyl acetate encapsulant is presented, which potentially allows to probe the composition of the encapsulant non-destructively under lab conditions but also on silicon solar modules in the field installed outdoors. The present report shows NIRA to be a powerful method for non-destructive analysis of backsheets and encapsulants of photovoltaic silicon modules.

Abstract: Two multilayer solar selective absorber coatings [Al/CrN0.95/Cr0.96Al0.04N1.08/Cr0.53Al0.47N1.12/Al2O3 (stack #1) and Cr0.96Al0.04N0.89/Cr0.62Al0.38N1.00/Cr0.53Al0.47N1.12/Al2O3 (stack #2)] were deposited on 316L steel by combining direct current (DC) and high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) technologies with the aim of increasing the working limit temperature. The composition and thickness of the constituent layers were optimized using CODE software to achieve a high solar absorptance (α) and low values of thermal emittance (ε) in the infrared region. The deposited multilayered stacks were heated during 2 h in air at 600, 700 and 800 °C to study their thermal stability and optical performance. Compositional, structural and optical characterization of the stacks (as-prepared and after thermal treatment) was performed. Both stacks presented a good solar selectivity with α > 95% and ε < 15%, were stable up to 600 °C and fulfilled the performance criterion PC < 5% after 600 and 700 °C treatments. Despite the stacks suffered chemical transformations above 600 °C, partial oxidation (stack #1) and Cr2N formation (stack #1 and #2), the optical properties were optimum up to 700 °C for stack #1 (α = 94%, ε(25 °C) = 12%) and 600 °C for stack #2 (α = 93%, ε(25 °C) = 13%). The solar-to-mechanical energy conversion efficiencies (η) of the as-deposited and annealed (600 and 700 °C) samples were up to 20% points higher than the absorber paint commercially used (Pyromark). At 800 °C, they underwent a further structural transformation, provoked by the oxidation of the inner layers, and they consequently lost their solar selectivity.

The technique's capability to determine the sheet resistance of charge carriers in inversion layers Rs,inv for silicon wafers coated by different dielectrics is investigated. The dielectrics - SiOx, SiNx and AlOx – used in this study are all highly relevant for photovoltaic applications, especially for inversion layer solar cell concepts. The newly developed generalized measurement routine and evaluation utilizing the phase dependent surface potential signals of the diff-JPV sensor resulted in a very rapid Rs,inv extraction even in the very high (>10 kΩ/sq.) Rs,inv range which is typical for inversion layers. However, reference inversion layer sheet resistance values can be hardly obtained without the fabrication of test devices. Thus, to validate the reliability of the diff-JPV measurement an indirect method is applied by measuring the mobility of the inversion charge carriers from the Rs,inv results after sequential surface corona charging steps. A very sharp transition of the diff-JPV results is observed showing significant signal in the inversion regime exclusively and providing Rs,inv results in the expected range. The inversion charge carrier mobility data, calculated from the Rs,inv versus surface charge plots, are consistent and comparable to those found from device tests. Sheet resistance and mobility results exhibit high sensitivity to the surface morphology (i.e, textured versus polished), the interface quality and the amount of charge within the given dielectrics. The contactless JPV is proven to be a fast and efficient way for the rapid characterization of inversion layers properties. It can even be accomplished in production lines in case of future industrialization of inversion layer based solar cell technologies.

Abstract: A terpyridine attached asymmetric viologen (TpyV) was synthesized, and its electrochromic properties in a single-layered electrochromic device (ECD) were demonstrated. The ECD showed a reversible color transition in the absence of anodic species, with a maximum transmittance of higher than 91%. Fast switching speeds to the colored (6.3 s) and bleached states (5.8 s) and enhanced kinetic stability of up to 360 cycles without transmittance loss were observed. The coloration efficiency (CE) was estimated to be 232.87 cm2/C, which is higher than those of the common viologen based ECDs. The relationship between the change in absorbance and the charge density (Qd) under various voltage biases showed a steadily increasing trend in Qd values with charge density, resulting in decreased CE values. The bulkiness of the counter anions showed a potent effect over the bleaching of the electroreduced state of TpyV. The optical memory of the TpyV ECD with BF4− as a counter anion lasted 30 min due to the weak charge transport. A flexible electrochromic device was also prepared by sandwiching all-in-one TpyV ion gel between ITO-PET substrates. The prepared device showed a reversible color transition in both flat and bent states. Current results suggest a promising approach in developing high-performance viologen electrochromes with high transmittance and switching stability.

Abstract: Summary
A tradeoff exists between triplet-pair separation versus relaxation that can limit the ability to utilize singlet fission for enhancing solar cell efficiency beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. Here, we show that this tradeoff can be avoided in crystalline environments by studying a functionalized pentacene compressed in a diamond anvil cell. We demonstrate, using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, that there is a “sweet spot” where the rate of triplet-pair separation can be accelerated by nearly an order of magnitude without causing fast excited state relaxation. X-ray diffraction and computational modeling allow us to quantify the corresponding increase of intermolecular coupling. Our findings suggest that increased coupling enhances excited state relaxation but that crystalline environments can suppress these relaxation processes in pentacene derivatives. The combination of these effects leads to the sweet spot and informs efforts to enhance triplet-pair separation rates in amorphous systems such as polymers.

Abstract: Objective
The aims of this study were to identify the main characteristics regarding the shape and size of the craniofacial region in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and sickle cell trait (SCT) and in unaffected patients using geometric morphometrics and to check the efficiency of this method.
Material and Methods
A cross-sectional analytical study of 45 patients (15 in each group) was performed. Lateral radiographs of the skull were used for the analysis. Seventeen landmarks and semilandmarks were placed for the measurements. The Pocrustes analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, canonical variate analysis, Mahalanobis and Procrustes distances and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering were performed. Allometric effects and sex characteristics were not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
Results
There were, however, significant differences (p < 0.05) in craniofacial shape among SCA, SCT and unaffected individuals. Those with SCA showed variations in the shape of the external auditory meatus and at the base of the occipital bone, in addition to the mandibular setback and upper incisor inclination, with a tendency towards prognathism. The individuals with SCT exhibited a similar craniofacial shape to those with SCA, but with slighter variations. Moreover, those with SCT were statistically closer in resemblance to unaffected individuals, given that SCT is not regarded as a disease.
Conclusion
This demonstrates the efficiency of geometric morphometrics in the categorization of the assessed groups.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in the chemistry of metal-free systems known as frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) has exposed new reactivity of the p-block elements, particularly in small-molecule activation and catalysis. Typically, the mode of activation by FLPs has been predicated on a heterolytic two-electron process, although recently, select FLPs have been shown to participate in single-electron processes. Here, we report the reaction of diaryl substituted esters with FLPs. This results in divergent pathways, one whereby the diaryl moiety is stabilized by the Lewis basic phosphine, and the alternative pathway, wherein a single-electron transfer process occurs, generating the [Mes3P]+⋅/[C(H)Ar2]⋅ radical ion pair. The latter species undergoes a homocoupling reaction to yield tetraphenylethane derivatives. In the presence of olefins, this reactivity can be harnessed through an sp2-sp3 C–C heterocoupling reaction to generate α,β-substituted olefins. Notably, this work showcases an FLP approach to metal-free radical C–H bond activation with subsequent C–C bond formation, which also displays complementary reactivity to other approaches.

Abstract: Background
Immunological life-threatening complications frequently occur in post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), despite matching recipient and donor (R/D) pairs for classical human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Studies have shown that R/D non-HLA disparities within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are associated with adverse effects post-HSCT.
Methods
We investigated the impact of mismatches of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in C4A/C4B genes, for showing the highest diversity in the MHC gamma block, on 238 patients who underwent HLA 10/10 unrelated donor (URD) HSCT. The endpoints were acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and mortality. One hundred and twenty-nine R/D pairs had 23 C4-SNPs typed by PCR-SSP (Gamma-Type™v.1.0), and 109 R/D pairs had these 23 SNPs identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the Illumina platform.
Results
The percentage of patients who received HSC from HLA 10/10 donors with 1–7 mismatches was 42.9%. The R/D pairs were considered C4mismatched when bearing at least one disparity. These mismatches were not found to be risk factors for aGVHD, cGVHD or mortality after unrelated HSCT when SNPs were analyzed together (matched or mm≥1), independently or according to the percentage of incompatibilities (full match for 23 SNPs; 1–3mm and >3mm). An exception was the association between 1–3 mismatches at the composite of SNPs C13193/T14952/T19588 with the development of aGVHD (P=0.012) and with grades III-IV of this disease (P=0.004).
Conclusion
Our data are not consistent with the hypothesis that disparities in C4A/C4B SNPs increase the risks of post-HSCT adverse effects for the endpoints investigated in this study.

Abstract: Background
An efficient mobilization and collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) are crucial to optimize engraftment in the recipient. We aim to validate a formula that predicted CD34+ cell yield and to describe variables that correlated with high yield mobilization and collection in healthy donors.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory data from healthy donors who underwent PBSC collection from 2006 to 2015. The predicted number of collected cells was calculated using the following formula: Total number of CD34+ (cells×106/kg) yield=[(peripheral CD34+ cells/μL)×(0.43)/recipient body weight (kg)]×total liters processed.
Results
We evaluated 338 collections from 307 allogeneic PBSC donors. The predicted versus the observed number of CD34+ cells/kg collected yielded an r-value of 0.775 (0.726–0.816; p<0.0001). Overall, 55.7% donors had an acceptable mobilization level. Donors with a body weight <67kg were less likely to yield a satisfactory CD34+ cell count (OR=0.44; 95% CI 0.24–0.81), while a white blood cell (WBC) count >40×109/L (OR=3.69; 2.11–6.46) and platelet count ≥200×109/L (OR=2.09; 1.26–3.47) on the day of collection predicted a good level of mobilization. Predictors of a CD34+ cell yield/kg of ≥4×106 with only one apheresis session were: circulating CD34+ cells/μL >40 (OR=16; 6.94–36.93), hemoglobin ≥14g/dL (OR=3.40; 1.53–7.57), WBC >40×109/L (OR=4.61; 2.10–10.10) on the first collection day, and a positive delta weight between donor and recipient (OR=3.10; 1.36–7.06).
Conclusion
The formula for predicting CD34+ cell yield is accurate and suggests the optimal length of time for successful leukapheresis. Validation of the predictors of successful mobilization will help to further refine PBSC leukapheresis procedures.

Abstract: Adipose-tissue derived stromal cells (ASCs) are currently considered as a full value alternative source of bone marrow MSCs for prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to their immunosuppressive potential. Besides, ASCs are known to support ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Ex vivo expansion enables to amplify significantly the number of HSPCs of different commitment. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) from cord blood (cb) contain HSPCs and are easily assessed. The rarity of those HSPCs is a serious limitation of its application in cell therapy. Here we expanded cbMNCs in stroma-dependent setting to generate heterocellular associates consisting of ASCs and undifferentiated and low committed hematopoietic cbHSPCs. A part of cbHSPCs in associates demonstrated a primitive phenotype confirmed by formation of “cobblestone areas". ASCs associated with cbHSPCs demonstrated up-regulation of immunosuppressive indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cyclooxygenase-2 (PTGS2) genes. ASC-cbHSPCs as well as ASCs provoked the suppression of HLA-DR activation and apoptosis of mitogen-stimulated T cells. VEGF transcription and secretion were elevated providing stimulation of blood vessel formation in ovo. Thus, ASCs retain immunosuppressive and proangiogenic capacities evidencing “third party” potential along with the effective support of ex vivo expansion of cbHSPCs. Above functions expand the relevance of ASCs for needs of regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Hereditary xerocytosis (HX) is a rare, autosomal dominant congenital hemolytic anemia (CHA) characterized by erythrocyte dehydration with presentation of various degrees of hemolytic anemia. HX is often misdiagnosed as hereditary spherocytosis or other CHA. Here we report three cases of suspected HX and one case of HX associated with β-thalassemia. Sanger method was used for sequencing cDNA of the PIEZO1 gene. Variants were evaluated for potential pathogenicity by MutationTaster, PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2 and M-CAP software, and by molecular modeling. Four different variants in the PIEZO1 gene were found, including three substitutions (p.D669H, p.D1566G, p.T1732 M) and one deletion (p.745delQ). In addition, in the patient with the p.T1732 M variant we detected a 12-nucleotide deletion in the β-globin gene leading to a deletion of amino acids 62AHGK65. The joint presence of mutations in two different genes connected with erythrocytes markedly aggravated the presentation of the disease. Bioinformatic analysis and molecular modeling strongly indicated likely deleterious effects of all four PIEZO1 variants, but co-segregation analysis showed that the p.D1566G substitution is in fact non-pathogenic. Identification of causative mutations should improve the diagnosis and management of HX and provide a new insight into the molecular basis of this complex red blood cell abnormality.

Abstract: Introduction
About 10% of sickle cell anemia patients will have ischemic stroke. Adams showed stroke incidence reduction in children receiving monthly erythrocyte transfusions by reducing transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities. Since then, chronic transfusion is recommended as primary stroke prophylaxis. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of chronic transfusions as stroke prophylaxis.
Method
Retrospective study, reviewing medical records from 15 sickle cell anemia patients undergoing chronic transfusion. Data collected were age, sex, adverse reactions, stroke, hemoglobin, reticulocytes, ferritin, HbS and TCD values (baseline, after 12 and 24months of treatment).
Results
The mean age was 118.67±41.40 months; six patients experienced allergic reactions. No stroke was recorded. One patient had alloimmunization. There was a decrease in the HbS rate and an increase in hemoglobin values in the first 12months. Values were maintained after 24months, but with no improvement of data. Before treatment, the mean HbS rate was 75.18%±11.69; after 12months, 41.63±14.99 and after 24months, 43.78±10.6. Thirteen patients initiated chelation after 12months from the beginning of chronic transfusions and ferritin decline after 24months. Pre-transfusional TCD velocities were 204.28±9.41cm/s (right) and 198.85±33.37cm/s (left). After a 12-month treatment, these values were 158.5±28.89cm/s and 157.62±34.43cm/s, respectively, and this reduction was statistically significant (p=0.002 right and p=0.02 left). After 24months, these values were 149.63±26.95cm/s (right) and 143.7±32.27cm/s (left).
Conclusion
Significant reduction of TCD velocity occurred after treatment with chronic transfusion in sickle cell anemia patients, leading to a normal or conditional test and reducing stroke risk in all but one patient.

Abstract: Background/Objective
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells, characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias along with hypercellularity of the bone marrow, and marked dysplastic features. Establishing MDS diagnosis is difficult due to nonspecific clinical presentation and imprecise morphological criteria. In anticipation to improve the diagnostic approach in this field, we aimed to characterize the clinical and morphological features of patients presented with cytopenias with a special focus on MDS.
Methods
We comprehensively reviewed all medical record of patients who were referred to the hematology laboratory at KFSH-RC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between January 2009 and March 2016 for evaluation of bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsies due to severe and persistent cytopenia(s) to rule out MDS.
Results
A total of 183 patients, 155 adult and 28 pediatric, were identified. In the adult group, MDS was diagnosed in 82 (52.9%) patients, with a male-to-female (M:F) ratio of 1.6:1 and mean age at diagnosis of 50 years. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2017 criteria, MDS subtypes were as follows: MDS with single lineage dysplasia (SLD, 5%), MDS with ring sideroblasts and SLD (MDS-RS-SLD 7%), MDS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD 21%), MDS with deletion of chromosome 5q (MDS del(5q), 2%), MDS unclassifiable (MDS-U7%), hypoplastic MDS (h-MDS 4%), MDS with excess blasts-1 (MDS-EB1, 20%), MDS with excess blasts-2 (MDS- EB2, 28%), and therapy-related MDS (6%). Laboratory and morphological features were described. In both groups, cytogenetic abnormalities were classified according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System cytogenetic risk groups. In adults, the dominating cytogenetic abnormalities were monosomy 5 and monosomy 7 seen in 20.7% and 24.4% of patients, respectively. Peripheral cytopenia not due to MDS was diagnosed in 54 (34.8%) patients, with a mean age of 43 years and M:F ratio of 1:1. The cause of these cytopenias were as follows: bone marrow failure (BMF, 22%), peripheral destruction (20%), drug induced (20%), anemia of chronic disease (16%), B12 deficiency (7%), infection (7%), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (4%), idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (2%), and idiopathic dysplasia of undetermined significance (2%). A definite diagnosis of MDS was not possible in 19 patients due to insufficient clinical data. In the pediatric group, MDS was diagnosed in 14/28 (50%) patients, with M:F ratio of 1.8:1 and mean age at diagnosis of 4 years. MDS subtypes (WHO 2017) in 14 patients were as follows: refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC, 42.8%), MDS-EB1 (42.8%), and MDS-EB2 (14.2%). Laboratory and morphological features were described. The prevalent cytogenetic abnormality was monosomy 7 in six/14 (42.8%) patients. Cytopenias due to other causes were diagnosed in eight/28 patients (28.5%), with a mean age of 6.5 years and M:F ratio of 1.6:1. The causes of non-MDS related cytopenia were: congenital BMF (4 patients), peripheral destruction (2 patients), immune deficiency (1 patient), and viral infection (1 patient). A definite diagnosis of MDS could not be made in six/28 (21.4%) patients.
Conclusion
MDS is the cause of cytopenia in a significant number of patients referred for evaluation of cytopenias, appears at younger age, and tends to be more aggressive than that reported in international studies. Anemia, dysplastic neutrophils in the peripheral blood, and dysplastic megakaryocytes in the bone marrow trephine biopsy are the most reliable features in distinguishing MDS from other alternative diagnoses.

Abstract: Introduction
Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), an active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), is reported to inhibit cell proliferation in hypertrophic scars (HS). In our previous study, we observed that lncRNA human-specific regulatory loci (HSRL) was up-regulated in HS tissues. However, whether TSIIA serves as an effective treatment for HS through affecting HSRL is still unexplored.
Methods
TGF-β1-stimulated fibroblast were used as the in vitro HS model. The effects of TSIIA on cell proliferation were evaluated using CCK-8, Edu staining and colony formation assays. By performing loss-of-function and rescue experiments, we explored the role of HSRL and Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) in TGF-β1-stimulated fibroblast. Employing RNA-protein pull-down assay and Co-immunoprecipitation, we further investigated the mechanisms through which TSIIA attenuated TGF-β1-stimulated fibroblast.
Results
Our data demonstrated that TSIIA could effectively attenuate TGF-β1-mediated fibroblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, TSIIA could down-regulate the expression of α-SMA, VEGFA, Collagen 1, HSRL, SNX9 and p-Smad2/3 in TGF-β1-stimulated HSF. In addition, we found that SNX9 overexpression reversed the effects of HSRL knockdown on TGF-β1-stimulated HSF. Furthermore, we confirmed that TSIIA treatment weakens the interaction between p-Smad3 and SNX9 in HS models.
Conclusions
Tanshinone IIA down-regulated p-Smad3 signaling to inhibit TGF-β1-mediated fibroblast proliferation via lncRNA-HSRL/SNX9.

Abstract: A multicenter, open-label, expanded-access study followed the safety of taliglucerase alfa, a plant cell–expressed recombinant enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), in adults with Gaucher disease previously treated with imiglucerase. Patients received taliglucerase alfa every 2 weeks for 9 months at a dose equivalent to their previous imiglucerase dose (Part A); patients were offered treatment for up to 33 months (Part B), and a later amendment allowed treatment-naïve patients. Fifty-eight patients received taliglucerase alfa (55.2% male; mean age, 46.1 years; mean bi-weekly dose, 35.2 U/kg; mean duration, 17.8 months); 51 patients previously received ERT, seven were treatment-naïve, and 36 completed the study. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; treatment-related adverse events were mild and transient. In previously treated patients, increases from baseline to last follow-up were observed for mean ± SE hemoglobin concentration (13.0 ± 0.3 g/dL to 13.4 ± 0.2 g/dL) and platelet count (179,242 ± 15,344/mm3 to 215,242 ± 17,867/mm3). Findings were similar in treatment-naïve patients (mean ± SE hemoglobin concentration and platelet count, 12.8 ± 0.3 g/dL to 13.5 ± 0.2 g/dL and 168,821 ± 14,368/mm3 to 204,641 ± 16,071/mm3, respectively). Taliglucerase alfa was well-tolerated for up to 33 months and demonstrated a durable therapeutic effect.

Abstract: Thin films of electrochromic (EC) W oxide were prepared by reactive DC magnetron sputtering and were immersed in electrolytes of LiClO4 in propylene carbonate with 0.5–3.0 wt% of added polyethylene oxide (PEO). Charge density and optical modulation range were found to diminish monotonically upon prolonged voltammetric cycling with concurrent optical transmittance measurements for up to 500 and 200 cycles in the voltage ranges 2.0–4.0 and 1.5–4.0 V vs. Li/Li+, respectively. Rejuvenation of the degraded EC films was then accomplished by potentiostatic treatment at 6.0 V vs. Li/Li+ for 20 h and has been ascribed to expulsion of trapped Li ions. Importantly, degradation subsequent to rejuvenation was found to progress at a significantly lowered pace than for as-deposited films—in proportion with the amount of PEO—especially for harsh voltammetric cycling in the voltage range 1.5–4.0 V vs. Li/Li+. The results of this explorative study are of considerable value for the development of highly durable EC devices such as polymer-laminated smart glazing for energy efficient buildings with excellent indoor comfort.

Abstract: Summary
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted broad interest recently due to their superior catalytic properties. However, a facile fabrication method for the large-scale synthesis of SACs is still in demand. This study reports a mechanochemical approach for the mass production of noble metal SACs. The successful formation of atomically dispersed palladium species on zinc oxide (Pd1/ZnO) was verified by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, our method exhibited little scaling-up effect on the mass production of Pd1/ZnO at ranges of 10–1,000 g, in which the catalyst structure and catalytic performance were retained. Meanwhile, the versatility of this approach was demonstrated by the large-scale fabrication of Rh and Ru SACs, and Pd1/Cu single-atom alloys. Thus, this promising strategy provides the potential for cost-effective mass production of SACs and subsequently may open a window for their industrial application.

Abstract: Background
The minimal residual disease (MRD) is the most important prognostic factor for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. This study aimed to investigate the influence of detecting the MRD by the multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) at day 15 (D15) of the induction on the analysis of the risk group classifications of the different childhood ALL treatment protocols used in a referral hospital in southern Brazil.
Method
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with B-cell ALL, aged 1 to 18 years, treated at a hospital from January 2013 to April 2017.
Main results
Seventy-five patients were analyzed. Regarding the MRD by the MFC at D15, the analyses showed statistical significance when the MRD was grouped into three categories, < 0.1%, 0.1–10%, and > 10%, with the following distribution: 30.7%, 52.0%, and 17.3%, respectively. There was a significant association between D15 MRD-MFC < 0.1% and the likelihood of dying or relapsing and between D15 MRD-MFC > 10% and the likelihood of dying or relapsing. The cumulative hazard ratio for the relapse of patients with D15 MRD-MFC < 0.1%, 0.1–10%, and > 10% was 19.2%, 59.8%, and 80.1%, respectively.
Conclusion
Our analysis suggests D15 MRD-MFC < 0.1% as a cut-off point for patients with more favorable outcomes and that the MRD at D15 in risk classifications is particularly useful for the stratification of patients with a more favorable prognosis.

Abstract: The conventional way to fabricate current sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling (SDRC) systems is to maximally suppress the cooler's solar absorption and substantially improve its selective emissivity only in the atmospheric transparency window. This greatly limits the selection of materials and their practical applications. In this paper, an alternative method, which combines sunlight-triggered fluorescent cooling, particle scattering, and broadband infrared radiation, was presented for creating serial eco-friendly coatings with the SDRC effect with conventional cost-effective building materials. The presence of conventional fluorescent pigments in the coating composition increased the effective direct-normal solar reflectance via sunlight-excited fluorescent emissions to the level required for SDRC. When applied to various substrates, the serial coatings exhibited distinct SDRC effects under direct and strong sunlight in typical temperate monsoon climate regions such as Beijing. The observed sub-ambient temperature reduction of the coating with yellow–green fluorescence over an aluminium plate was 3.5 °C under a peak solar intensity of 996 W/m2, yielding a cooling power of 45.7 W/m2 under a peak solar intensity of 981 W/m2. Compared with the conventional cool white coatings, the large-scale application of the coating to urban surfaces is predicted to reduce a city's air temperature by approximately 1 °C and thereby decrease the Heat Island Intensity. Additionally, the method proposed in this paper was generic and expanded the SDRC design paradigm, thereby promoting SDRC as a viable energy-efficient technology.

Abstract: Inflammation and angiogenesis are linked to the development of cancer since both can support the establishment of a tumor-prone microenvironment. The CCR5 is a major regulatory molecule involved in inflammation. The CD34 molecule is commonly described as a hematopoietic stem cell marker, and CD34+ cells are involved in the regulation of distinct physiological processes, including angiogenesis. CCR5 participates in the development of various types of cancer, and recently, a reduced CCR5 expression was associated with low CD34+ cell counts in human cord blood. A naturally occurring genetic variant of the CCR5 gene, the so-called CCR5Δ32 polymorphism, consists of a 32 base-pair deletion in the DNA, interfering in the CCR5 protein levels on the cell surface. When in homozygosis, this variant leads to a total absence of CCR5 expression on the cell surface. In heterozygous individuals, CCR5 surface levels are reduced. Based on these key findings, we hypothesize that a functional interaction can connect CCR5 and CD34 molecules (giving rise to a “CCR5-CD34 axis”). According to this, a CCR5-CD34 interaction can potentially support the development of different types of cancer. Consequently, the lack of CCR5 in association with reduced CD34+ cell counts could indicate a protective factor against the development of cancer. It is required to characterize in detail the functional relationship between CCR5 and CD34 proteins, as well as the real influence of both molecules on the susceptibility and development of cancer at population level. If our hypothesis is confirmed, the CCR5-CD34 axis may be a potential target in the development of anti-cancer therapies.

Abstract: Objective
To describe the oral health status of patients with multiple myeloma and compare to a control group.
Materials and methods
The medical history of the studied subjects was obtained from the medical records and through interviews. Trained examiners evaluated the oral mucosa, teeth, periodontium and imaging aspects. The dental status was evaluated by the decayed, missing and filled teeth index. The presence of bone lesions was investigated with cone beam computer tomography images of the jaws.
Results
The most common oral mucosa features were paleness (31%) and coated tongue (14.3%) in the multiple myeloma group (N=42); and coated (21.4%) and fissured tongue (10.7%) in the control group (N=28). The mean DMFT index of patients with multiple myeloma was high, but not significantly different from controls (14.57 versus 19.69, p=0.975). Hypodense lesions suggestive of multiple myeloma were observed in the jaws of 73.8% of the patients. Hypodense lesions related to teeth were detected in 33.3% of the patients and in 53.6% of the controls (p=0.832).
Conclusions
The studied population of multiple myeloma patients presented many oral health issues that needed attention. Thus, oral care should be included in the routine treatment to improve the quality of the oral status in these patients.

Abstract: Aurora-kinase-A (AURKA), BORA and Polo-like-kinase-1 (PLK1) are regulating cell-cycle control and promotion of mitosis entry. AURKA contributes to Janus-kinase-2 (JAK2) activation and increased AURKA protein levels were reported in CD34+ and CD41+ cells of myeloproliferative neoplasm patients, leading to aneuploidy and aberrant megakaryopoiesis. We aimed to investigate AURKA, BORA and PLK1 mRNA expression in unfractionated bone-marrow aspirates of 43 patients with myelofibrosis (28 primary-/PMF, 15 secondary-myelofibrosis/SMF) and 12 controls and to assess their clinical correlations. AURKA expression did not significantly differ between myelofibrosis and controls (P = 0.466). Higher AURKA expression was significantly associated with higher absolute monocyte-count (P = 0.024) and shorter overall survival (HR = 3.77; P = 0.012). Patients with both PMF and SMF had lower BORA expression than controls (P = 0.009). Higher BORA expression was significantly associated with absence of constitutional symptoms (P = 0.049), absence of circulatory blasts (P = 0.047), higher monocyte- (P = 0.040) and higher eosinophil-counts (P = 0.016) and had neutral effect on survival (P > 0.05). PLK1 expression did not significantly differ between myelofibrosis and controls (P = 0.103). Higher PLK1 expression was significantly associated with higher white-blood-cell-count (P = 0.042) and inferior overall survival (HR = 5.87; P = 0.003). In conclusion, AURKA, BORA and PLK1 are involved in pathogenesis of myelofibrosis and may affect survival. Future studies investigating these interesting associations are warranted.

Abstract: Introduction
: Most adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will eventually relapse from their disease. The combination of 7-day cytarabine and an anthracycline on days 1–3 (the so called “7 + 3” regimen) can be considered standard of care of younger patients with AML. However, the treatment of the elderly ineligible for intensive chemotherapy remains a challenge. Low-dose of subcutaneous cytarabine or hypomethylating agents (HMA) have been studied this group. There are no studies investigating physician practice variation in treating AML in Brazil.
Methods
: We developed a survey with ten questions in order to explore the approach to AML in Brazil.
Results
: The sample size comprised 100 hematologists. Most reported regular (63%) or occasional (29%) treatment of AML patients. Karyotype analysis and polymerase chain reaction were available in 88% and 71% of institutions, respectively. Next generation sequencing analysis was used in 7% of instituitions. Younger patients receive the “7 + 3” protocol with continuous infusion of cytarabine and anthracycline in 98% of cases. The preferred anthracycline is daunorubicin (64%), followed by idarubicin (34%). The most prescribed daunorubicin dose was 60 mg/m2 (56%). Consolidation after CR with high cytarabine doses (HIDAC) was indicated by 84% of hematologists and 70% use 3 g/m2 twice a day for 3 days. Elderly and unfit patients received HMA (47%) as the preferred treatment.
Conclusion
: We showed that the most prevalent AML treatments were according to current guidelines. There is room to improve on the availability of diagnostic tools and the capacity to perform bone marrow transplantation.

Abstract: The possibility that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) could modulate α1A-adrenergic receptor (α1A-AR) function and regulation was tested employing LNCaP and HEK293 cells transfected to express the enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged human α1A-AR. Receptor phosphorylation and internalization, intracellular free calcium, α1A-AR-GSK3 colocalization, and coimmunoprecipitation were studied. The effects of the pharmacological GSK3 inhibitor, SB-216763, and the coexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of this kinase, as well as the signaling, desensitization, and internalization of receptors with S229, S258, S352, and S381 substitutions for alanine or aspartate, were also determined. SB-216763 inhibited agonist- and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-mediated α1A-AR phosphorylation, reduced oxymetazoline-induced desensitization, and magnified that induced by PMA. Agonists and PMA increased receptor-GSK3 colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation. Expression of a dominant-negative GSK3 mutant reduced agonist- but not PMA-induced receptor internalization. α1A-AR with the GSK3 putative target sites mutated to alanine exhibited reduced phosphorylation and internalization in response to agonists and increased PMA-induced desensitization. Agonist-induced, but not PMA-induced, receptor-β arrestin intracellular colocalization was diminished in cells expressing the GSK3 putative target sites mutated to alanine. Our data indicated that GSK3 exerts a dual action on α1A-AR participating in agonist-mediated desensitization and internalization and avoiding PMA-induced desensitization.

Abstract: Gestational diabetes (GDM) affects about 20 % of pregnancies globally. Defective insulin receptor (IR) signaling has been found in the placenta from patients with GDM, but the underly mechanism is still unclear. In the present study, the mRNA and protein levels of IR-α, insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS-1) and inulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) were detected in the placenta tissue samples from 33 GDM patients and 20 healthy controls. Reduced IR-α protein level was observed in both obese and non-obese GDM patients, and decreased IGF1R protein level was found in obese GDM patients. However, the IR-α and IGF1R mRNAs level was not significantly altered in GDM patients. Subsequently, the expression of 10 miRNAs that have the potential targeting IR-α and IGF1R was examined by qRT-PCR in the placenta, and miR-140-3p was found overexpressed. Through dual-luciferase assay and immunoblotting, miR-140-3p was confirmed to suppress IR-α and IGF1R expression via targeting the 3’UTRs. As a treatment candidate, naringenin downregulated miR-140-3p level in trophoblasts and endothelial cells. Meanwhile, IR-α and IGF1R expression was upregulated by naringenin, and the glucose uptake was increased in naringenin treated trophoblasts and endothelial cells. Finally, naringenin upregulated cell viability, migration capacity of HTR-8/SVneo and HUVEC cells, and increased HUVEC cells angiogenesis in high glucose condition. In conclusion, miR-140-3p overexpression contributes to the defective placental IR signaling in patients with GDM. Naringenin treatment protects trophoblasts and endothelial cells from the harmful high glucose environment which have the potential for GDM treatment.

Abstract: We analyzed the characteristics of coagulopathy in cytogenetically and molecularly distinct acute leukemias. We retrospectively analyzed 211 adult patients with de novo non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 105 newly diagnosed patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurrence was assessed according the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria. Further, we analyzed the associations of the cytogenetics and mutations with DIC development and coagulation profile. Significant differences were observed between APL and non-APL AML (P = 0.001), APL and B-ALL (P = 0.002), and non-APL AML and B-ALL (P = 0.009) in the distribution of ISTH DIC scores of the acute leukemia patients that met the criteria for diagnosis of DIC. Except for the elevated leukocyte count, a normal karyotype with NPM1 mutations or/and FLT3-ITD mutations was independently associated with the development of DIC in non-APL AML, characterized by significant PT prolongation and significantly elevated D-Dimers. The P210BCR-ABL1 transcript strongly predicted hypofibrinogenemia in B-ALL in the final multivariate model, but Philadelphia chromosome negatively affected elevated D-dimers. In conclusion, DIC occurrence and the coagulation profile were associated with the cytogenetics and mutations in acute leukemia.

Abstract: Micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy is applied in this work to characterise the shallow phosphorus diffusions occurring below poly-silicon passivating contacts for silicon solar cells, courtesy of the bandgap narrowing effect in the heavily-doped region. We present the photoluminescence spectra from samples of various diffusion profiles, achieved by changing the phosphorus diffusion temperature and oxide interlayer thickness. The photoluminescence peak from the shallow phosphorus diffusion region, when normalised against the substrate crystalline silicon peak, changes in intensity in accordance with the dopant profiles. Photoluminescence spectra measured with two lasers of different penetration depths are compared in this study, and their relative strengths and weaknesses are assessed. Micron-scale line scanning across localised poly-silicon structures demonstrates that the method can identify the presence of the underlying diffused regions with a spatial resolution of several microns.
