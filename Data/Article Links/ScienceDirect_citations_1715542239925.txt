Abstract: Summary
The enhancer landscape of pluripotent stem cells undergoes extensive reorganization during early mammalian development. The functions and mechanisms behind such reorganization, however, are unclear. Here, we show that the transcription factor GRHL2 is necessary and sufficient to activate an epithelial subset of enhancers as naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) transition into formative epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). Surprisingly, many GRHL2 target genes do not change in expression during the ESC-EpiLC transition. Instead, enhancers regulating these genes in ESCs diminish in activity in EpiLCs while GRHL2-dependent alternative enhancers become activated to maintain transcription. GRHL2 therefore assumes control over a subset of the naive network via enhancer switching to maintain expression of epithelial genes upon exit from naive pluripotency. These data evoke a model where the naive pluripotency network becomes partitioned into smaller, independent networks regulated by EpiLC-specific transcription factors, thereby priming cells for lineage specification.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation is a risk factor for cancer development. Individuals with preleukemic TET2 mutations manifest clonal hematopoiesis and are at a higher risk of developing leukemia. How inflammatory signals influence the survival of preleukemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is unclear. We show a rapid increase in the frequency and absolute number of Tet2-KO mature myeloid cells and HSPCs in response to inflammatory stress, which results in enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), and resistance to apoptosis. IL-6 induces hyperactivation of the Shp2-Stat3 signaling axis, resulting in increased expression of a novel anti-apoptotic long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), Morrbid, in Tet2-KO myeloid cells and HSPCs. Expression of activated Shp2 in HSPCs phenocopies Tet2 loss with regard to hyperactivation of Stat3 and Morrbid. In vivo, pharmacologic inhibition of Shp2 or Stat3 or genetic loss of Morrbid in Tet2 mutant mice rescues inflammatory-stress-induced abnormalities in HSPCs and mature myeloid cells, including clonal hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
The urea cycle (UC) is the main pathway by which mammals dispose of waste nitrogen. We find that specific alterations in the expression of most UC enzymes occur in many tumors, leading to a general metabolic hallmark termed “UC dysregulation” (UCD). UCD elicits nitrogen diversion toward carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydrooratase (CAD) activation and enhances pyrimidine synthesis, resulting in detectable changes in nitrogen metabolites in both patient tumors and their bio-fluids. The accompanying excess of pyrimidine versus purine nucleotides results in a genomic signature consisting of transversion mutations at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. This mutational bias is associated with increased numbers of hydrophobic tumor antigens and a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors independent of mutational load. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that UCD is a common feature of tumors that profoundly affects carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and immunotherapy response.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immune memory is an emerging area of research. However, innate immune memory at major mucosal sites remains poorly understood. Here, we show that respiratory viral infection induces long-lasting memory alveolar macrophages (AMs). Memory AMs are programed to express high MHC II, a defense-ready gene signature, and increased glycolytic metabolism, and produce, upon re-stimulation, neutrophil chemokines. Using a multitude of approaches, we reveal that the priming, but not maintenance, of memory AMs requires the help from effector CD8 T cells. T cells jump-start this process via IFN-γ production. We further find that formation and maintenance of memory AMs are independent of monocytes or bone marrow progenitors. Finally, we demonstrate that memory AMs are poised for robust trained immunity against bacterial infection in the lung via rapid induction of chemokines and neutrophilia. Our study thus establishes a new paradigm of immunological memory formation whereby adaptive T-lymphocytes render innate memory of mucosal-associated macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Phase transitions involving biomolecular liquids are a fundamental mechanism underlying intracellular organization. In the cell nucleus, liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is implicated in assembly of the nucleolus, as well as transcriptional clusters, and other nuclear bodies. However, it remains unclear whether and how physical forces associated with nucleation, growth, and wetting of liquid condensates can directly restructure chromatin. Here, we use CasDrop, a novel CRISPR-Cas9-based optogenetic technology, to show that various IDPs phase separate into liquid condensates that mechanically exclude chromatin as they grow and preferentially form in low-density, largely euchromatic regions. A minimal physical model explains how this stiffness sensitivity arises from lower mechanical energy associated with deforming softer genomic regions. Targeted genomic loci can nonetheless be mechanically pulled together through surface tension-driven coalescence. Nuclear condensates may thus function as mechano-active chromatin filters, physically pulling in targeted genomic loci while pushing out non-targeted regions of the neighboring genome.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory disorders of the CNS are frequently accompanied by synaptic loss, which is thought to involve phagocytic microglia and complement components. However, the mechanisms accounting for aberrant synaptic connectivity in the context of CD8+ T cell-driven neuronal damage are poorly understood. Here, we profiled the neuronal translatome in a murine model of encephalitis caused by CD8+ T cells targeting antigenic neurons. Neuronal STAT1 signaling and downstream CCL2 expression were essential for apposition of phagocytes, ensuing synaptic loss and neurological disease. Analogous observations were made in the brains of Rasmussen’s encephalitis patients. In this devastating CD8+ T cell-driven autoimmune disease, neuronal STAT1 phosphorylation and CCL2 expression co-clustered with infiltrating CD8+ T cells as well as phagocytes. Taken together, our findings uncover an active role of neurons in coordinating phagocyte-mediated synaptic loss and highlight neuronal STAT1 and CCL2 as critical steps in this process that are amenable to pharmacological interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Overnutrition disrupts circadian metabolic rhythms by mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we show that diet-induced obesity (DIO) causes massive remodeling of circadian enhancer activity in mouse liver, triggering synchronous high-amplitude circadian rhythms of both fatty acid (FA) synthesis and oxidation. SREBP expression was rhythmically induced by DIO, leading to circadian FA synthesis and, surprisingly, FA oxidation (FAO). DIO similarly caused a high-amplitude circadian rhythm of PPARα, which was also required for FAO. Provision of a pharmacological activator of PPARα abrogated the requirement of SREBP for FAO (but not FA synthesis), suggesting that SREBP indirectly controls FAO via production of endogenous PPARα ligands. The high-amplitude rhythm of PPARα imparted time-of-day-dependent responsiveness to lipid-lowering drugs. Thus, acquisition of rhythmicity for non-core clock components PPARα and SREBP1 remodels metabolic gene transcription in response to overnutrition and enables a chronopharmacological approach to metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Human health is dependent upon environmental exposures, yet the diversity and variation in exposures are poorly understood. We developed a sensitive method to monitor personal airborne biological and chemical exposures and followed the personal exposomes of 15 individuals for up to 890 days and over 66 distinct geographical locations. We found that individuals are potentially exposed to thousands of pan-domain species and chemical compounds, including insecticides and carcinogens. Personal biological and chemical exposomes are highly dynamic and vary spatiotemporally, even for individuals located in the same general geographical region. Integrated analysis of biological and chemical exposomes revealed strong location-dependent relationships. Finally, construction of an exposome interaction network demonstrated the presence of distinct yet interconnected human- and environment-centric clouds, comprised of interacting ecosystems such as human, flora, pets, and arthropods. Overall, we demonstrate that human exposomes are diverse, dynamic, spatiotemporally-driven interaction networks with the potential to impact human health.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas endonucleases directed against foreign nucleic acids mediate prokaryotic adaptive immunity and have been tailored for broad genetic engineering applications. Type VI-D CRISPR systems contain the smallest known family of single effector Cas enzymes, and their signature Cas13d ribonuclease employs guide RNAs to cleave matching target RNAs. To understand the molecular basis for Cas13d function and explain its compact molecular architecture, we resolved cryoelectron microscopy structures of Cas13d-guide RNA binary complex and Cas13d-guide-target RNA ternary complex to 3.4 and 3.3 Å resolution, respectively. Furthermore, a 6.5 Å reconstruction of apo Cas13d combined with hydrogen-deuterium exchange revealed conformational dynamics that have implications for RNA scanning. These structures, together with biochemical and cellular characterization, provide insights into its RNA-guided, RNA-targeting mechanism and delineate a blueprint for the rational design of improved transcriptome engineering technologies.

Abstract: Summary
In the auditory system, type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) convey complex acoustic information from inner hair cells (IHCs) to the brainstem. Although SGNs exhibit variation in physiological and anatomical properties, it is unclear which features are endogenous and which reflect input from synaptic partners. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we derived a molecular classification of mouse type I SGNs comprising three subtypes that express unique combinations of Ca2+ binding proteins, ion channel regulators, guidance molecules, and transcription factors. Based on connectivity and susceptibility to age-related loss, these subtypes correspond to those defined physiologically. Additional intrinsic differences among subtypes and across the tonotopic axis highlight an unexpectedly active role for SGNs in auditory processing. SGN identities emerge postnatally and are disrupted in a mouse model of deafness that lacks IHC-driven activity. These results elucidate the range, nature, and origins of SGN diversity, with implications for treatment of congenital deafness.

Abstract: Summary
During mitosis, chromatin condensation shapes chromosomes as separate, rigid, and compact sister chromatids to facilitate their segregation. Here, we show that, unlike wild-type yeast chromosomes, non-chromosomal DNA circles and chromosomes lacking a centromere fail to condense during mitosis. The centromere promotes chromosome condensation strictly in cis through recruiting the kinases Aurora B and Bub1, which trigger the autonomous condensation of the entire chromosome. Shugoshin and the deacetylase Hst2 facilitated spreading the condensation signal to the chromosome arms. Targeting Aurora B to DNA circles or centromere-ablated chromosomes or releasing Shugoshin from PP2A-dependent inhibition bypassed the centromere requirement for condensation and enhanced the mitotic stability of DNA circles. Our data indicate that yeast cells license the chromosome-autonomous condensation of their chromatin in a centromere-dependent manner, excluding from this process non-centromeric DNA and thereby inhibiting their propagation.

Abstract: Summary
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play essential roles in memory formation, neuronal plasticity, and brain development, with their dysfunction linked to a range of disorders from ischemia to schizophrenia. Zinc and pH are physiological allosteric modulators of NMDARs, with GluN2A-containing receptors inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of divalent zinc and by excursions to low pH. Despite the widespread importance of zinc and proton modulation of NMDARs, the molecular mechanism by which these ions modulate receptor activity has proven elusive. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy to elucidate the structure of the GluN1/GluN2A NMDAR in a large ensemble of conformations under a range of physiologically relevant zinc and proton concentrations. We show how zinc binding to the amino terminal domain elicits structural changes that are transduced though the ligand-binding domain and result in constriction of the ion channel gate.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptation of liver to the postprandial state requires coordinated regulation of protein synthesis and folding aligned with changes in lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that sensory food perception is sufficient to elicit early activation of hepatic mTOR signaling, Xbp1 splicing, increased expression of ER-stress genes, and phosphatidylcholine synthesis, which translate into a rapid morphological ER remodeling. These responses overlap with those activated during refeeding, where they are maintained and constantly increased upon nutrient supply. Sensory food perception activates POMC neurons in the hypothalamus, optogenetic activation of POMC neurons activates hepatic mTOR signaling and Xbp1 splicing, whereas lack of MC4R expression attenuates these responses to sensory food perception. Chemogenetic POMC-neuron activation promotes sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) subserving the liver, and norepinephrine evokes the same responses in hepatocytes in vitro and in liver in vivo as observed upon sensory food perception. Collectively, our experiments unravel that sensory food perception coordinately primes postprandial liver ER adaption through a melanocortin-SNA-mTOR-Xbp1s axis.

Abstract: Summary
Given that genomic DNA exerts its function by being transcribed, it is critical for the maintenance of homeostasis that DNA damage, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs), within transcriptionally active regions undergoes accurate repair. However, it remains unclear how this is achieved. Here, we describe a mechanism for transcription-associated homologous recombination repair (TA-HRR) in human cells. The process is initiated by R-loops formed upon DSB induction. We identify Rad52, which is recruited to the DSB site in a DNA-RNA-hybrid-dependent manner, as playing pivotal roles in promoting XPG-mediated R-loop processing and initiating subsequent repair by HRR. Importantly, dysfunction of TA-HRR promotes DSB repair via non-homologous end joining, leading to a striking increase in genomic aberrations. Thus, our data suggest that the presence of R-loops around DSBs within transcriptionally active regions promotes accurate repair of DSBs via processing by Rad52 and XPG to protect genomic information in these critical regions from gene alterations.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in response to elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Whereas the onset of simple steatosis requires elevated de novo lipogenesis, progression to NASH is triggered by accumulation of hepatocyte-free cholesterol. We now show that caspase-2, whose expression is ER-stress inducible and elevated in human and mouse NASH, controls the buildup of hepatic-free cholesterol and triglycerides by activating sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) in a manner refractory to feedback inhibition. Caspase-2 colocalizes with site 1 protease (S1P) and cleaves it to generate a soluble active fragment that initiates SCAP-independent SREBP1/2 activation in the ER. Caspase-2 ablation or pharmacological inhibition prevents diet-induced steatosis and NASH progression in ER-stress-prone mice. Caspase-2 inhibition offers a specific and effective strategy for preventing or treating stress-driven fatty liver diseases, whereas caspase-2-generated S1P proteolytic fragments, which enter the secretory pathway, are potential NASH biomarkers.

Abstract: Summary
Programmable control of spatial genome organization is a powerful approach for studying how nuclear structure affects gene regulation and cellular function. Here, we develop a versatile CRISPR-genome organization (CRISPR-GO) system that can efficiently control the spatial positioning of genomic loci relative to specific nuclear compartments, including the nuclear periphery, Cajal bodies, and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. CRISPR-GO is chemically inducible and reversible, enabling interrogation of real-time dynamics of chromatin interactions with nuclear compartments in living cells. Inducible repositioning of genomic loci to the nuclear periphery allows for dissection of mitosis-dependent and -independent relocalization events and also for interrogation of the relationship between gene position and gene expression. CRISPR-GO mediates rapid de novo formation of Cajal bodies at desired chromatin loci and causes significant repression of endogenous gene expression over long distances (30–600 kb). The CRISPR-GO system offers a programmable platform to investigate large-scale spatial genome organization and function.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid-liquid phase separation plays a key role in the assembly of diverse intracellular structures. However, the biophysical principles by which phase separation can be precisely localized within subregions of the cell are still largely unclear, particularly for low-abundance proteins. Here, we introduce an oligomerizing biomimetic system, “Corelets,” and utilize its rapid and quantitative light-controlled tunability to map full intracellular phase diagrams, which dictate the concentrations at which phase separation occurs and the transition mechanism, in a protein sequence dependent manner. Surprisingly, both experiments and simulations show that while intracellular concentrations may be insufficient for global phase separation, sequestering protein ligands to slowly diffusing nucleation centers can move the cell into a different region of the phase diagram, resulting in localized phase separation. This diffusive capture mechanism liberates the cell from the constraints of global protein abundance and is likely exploited to pattern condensates associated with diverse biological processes.

SUMO Safeguards Somatic and Pluripotent Cell Identities by Enforcing Distinct Chromatin States,

Abstract: Summary
Understanding general principles that safeguard cellular identity should reveal critical insights into common mechanisms underlying specification of varied cell types. Here, we show that SUMO modification acts to stabilize cell fate in a variety of contexts. Hyposumoylation enhances pluripotency reprogramming in vitro and in vivo, increases lineage transdifferentiation, and facilitates leukemic cell differentiation. Suppressing sumoylation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) promotes their conversion into 2-cell-embryo-like (2C-like) cells. During reprogramming to pluripotency, SUMO functions on fibroblastic enhancers to retain somatic transcription factors together with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, thus impeding somatic enhancer inactivation. In contrast, in ESCs, SUMO functions on heterochromatin to silence the 2C program, maintaining both proper H3K9me3 levels genome-wide and repression of the Dux locus by triggering recruitment of the sumoylated PRC1.6 and Kap/Setdb1 repressive complexes. Together, these studies show that SUMO acts on chromatin as a glue to stabilize key determinants of somatic and pluripotent states.

Abstract: Summary
Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) transmit sound information from cochlear hair cells to the CNS. Using transcriptome analysis of thousands of single neurons, we demonstrate that murine type I SGNs consist of subclasses that are defined by the expression of subsets of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, and neurotransmitter receptors. Subtype specification is initiated prior to the onset of hearing during the time period when auditory circuits mature. Gene mutations linked to deafness that disrupt hair cell mechanotransduction or glutamatergic signaling perturb the firing behavior of SGNs prior to hearing onset and disrupt SGN subtype specification. We thus conclude that an intact hair cell mechanotransduction machinery is critical during the pre-hearing period to regulate the firing behavior of SGNs and their segregation into subtypes. Because deafness is frequently caused by defects in hair cells, our findings have significant ramifications for the etiology of hearing loss and its treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Generally repressed by epigenetic mechanisms, retrotransposons represent around 40% of the murine genome. At the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) locus, an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) of the intracisternal A particle (IAP) class retrotransposed upstream of the agouti coat-color locus, providing an alternative promoter that is variably DNA methylated in genetically identical individuals. This results in variable expressivity of coat color that is inherited transgenerationally. Here, a systematic genome-wide screen identifies multiple C57BL/6J murine IAPs with Avy epigenetic properties. Each exhibits a stable methylation state within an individual but varies between individuals. Only in rare instances do they act as promoters controlling adjacent gene expression. Their methylation state is locus-specific within an individual, and their flanking regions are enriched for CTCF. Variably methylated IAPs are reprogrammed after fertilization and re-established as variable loci in the next generation, indicating reconstruction of metastable epigenetic states and challenging the generalizability of non-genetic inheritance at these regions.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mediator and functional significance of meal-associated brown fat (BAT) thermogenesis remains elusive. Here, we identified the gut hormone secretin as a non-sympathetic BAT activator mediating prandial thermogenesis, which consequentially induces satiation, thereby establishing a gut-secretin-BAT-brain axis in mammals with a physiological role of prandial thermogenesis in the control of satiation. Mechanistically, meal-associated rise in circulating secretin activates BAT thermogenesis by stimulating lipolysis upon binding to secretin receptors in brown adipocytes, which is sensed in the brain and promotes satiation. Chronic infusion of a modified human secretin transiently elevates energy expenditure in diet-induced obese mice. Clinical trials with human subjects showed that thermogenesis after a single-meal ingestion correlated with postprandial secretin levels and that secretin infusions increased glucose uptake in BAT. Collectively, our findings highlight the largely unappreciated function of BAT in the control of satiation and qualify BAT as an even more attractive target for treating obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Mdn1 is an essential AAA (ATPase associated with various activities) protein that removes assembly factors from distinct precursors of the ribosomal 60S subunit. However, Mdn1’s large size (∼5,000 amino acid [aa]) and its limited homology to other well-studied proteins have restricted our understanding of its remodeling function. Here, we present structures for S. pombe Mdn1 in the presence of AMPPNP at up to ∼4 Å or ATP plus Rbin-1, a chemical inhibitor, at ∼8 Å resolution. These data reveal that Mdn1’s MIDAS domain is tethered to its ring-shaped AAA domain through an ∼20 nm long structured linker and a flexible ∼500 aa Asp/Glu-rich motif. We find that the MIDAS domain, which also binds other ribosome-assembly factors, docks onto the AAA ring in a nucleotide state-specific manner. Together, our findings reveal how conformational changes in the AAA ring can be directly transmitted to the MIDAS domain and thereby drive the targeted release of assembly factors from ribosomal 60S-subunit precursors.

Abstract: Summary
The mouse embryo has long been central to the study of mammalian development; however, elucidating the cell behaviors governing gastrulation and the formation of tissues and organs remains a fundamental challenge. A major obstacle is the lack of live imaging and image analysis technologies capable of systematically following cellular dynamics across the developing embryo. We developed a light-sheet microscope that adapts itself to the dramatic changes in size, shape, and optical properties of the post-implantation mouse embryo and captures its development from gastrulation to early organogenesis at the cellular level. We furthermore developed a computational framework for reconstructing long-term cell tracks, cell divisions, dynamic fate maps, and maps of tissue morphogenesis across the entire embryo. By jointly analyzing cellular dynamics in multiple embryos registered in space and time, we built a dynamic atlas of post-implantation mouse development that, together with our microscopy and computational methods, is provided as a resource.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV) infection often results in fatal illness in humans, yet little is known about how EBOV usurps host pathways during infection. To address this, we used affinity tag-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to generate an EBOV-host protein-protein interaction (PPI) map. We uncovered 194 high-confidence EBOV-human PPIs, including one between the viral transcription regulator VP30 and the host ubiquitin ligase RBBP6. Domain mapping identified a 23 amino acid region within RBBP6 that binds to VP30. A crystal structure of the VP30-RBBP6 peptide complex revealed that RBBP6 mimics the viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the same interface of VP30. Knockdown of endogenous RBBP6 stimulated viral transcription and increased EBOV replication, whereas overexpression of either RBBP6 or the peptide strongly inhibited both. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of biologics that target this interface and identify additional PPIs that may be leveraged for novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The gut is now recognized as a major regulator of motivational and emotional states. However, the relevant gut-brain neuronal circuitry remains unknown. We show that optical activation of gut-innervating vagal sensory neurons recapitulates the hallmark effects of stimulating brain reward neurons. Specifically, right, but not left, vagal sensory ganglion activation sustained self-stimulation behavior, conditioned both flavor and place preferences, and induced dopamine release from Substantia nigra. Cell-specific transneuronal tracing revealed asymmetric ascending pathways of vagal origin throughout the CNS. In particular, transneuronal labeling identified the glutamatergic neurons of the dorsolateral parabrachial region as the obligatory relay linking the right vagal sensory ganglion to dopamine cells in Substantia nigra. Consistently, optical activation of parabrachio-nigral projections replicated the rewarding effects of right vagus excitation. Our findings establish the vagal gut-to-brain axis as an integral component of the neuronal reward pathway. They also suggest novel vagal stimulation approaches to affective disorders.

Abstract: Summary
As somatic cells are converted into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), their chromatin is remodeled to a pluripotent configuration with unique euchromatin-to-heterochromatin ratios, DNA methylation patterns, and enhancer and promoter status. The molecular machinery underlying this process is largely unknown. Here, we show that embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific factors Dppa2 and Dppa4 play a key role in resetting the epigenome to a pluripotent state. They are induced in reprogramming intermediates, function as a heterodimer, and are required for efficient reprogramming of mouse and human cells. When co-expressed with Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and Myc (OKSM) factors, Dppa2/4 yield reprogramming efficiencies that exceed 80% and accelerate reprogramming kinetics, generating iPSCs in 2 to 4 days. When bound to chromatin, Dppa2/4 initiate global chromatin decompaction via the DNA damage response pathway and contribute to downregulation of somatic genes and activation of ESC enhancers, all of which enables an efficient transition to pluripotency. Our work provides critical insights into how the epigenome is remodeled during acquisition of pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotic cells, organelles and the cytoskeleton undergo highly dynamic yet organized interactions capable of orchestrating complex cellular functions. Visualizing these interactions requires noninvasive, long-duration imaging of the intracellular environment at high spatiotemporal resolution and low background. To achieve these normally opposing goals, we developed grazing incidence structured illumination microscopy (GI-SIM) that is capable of imaging dynamic events near the basal cell cortex at 97-nm resolution and 266 frames/s over thousands of time points. We employed multi-color GI-SIM to characterize the fast dynamic interactions of diverse organelles and the cytoskeleton, shedding new light on the complex behaviors of these structures. Precise measurements of microtubule growth or shrinkage events helped distinguish among models of microtubule dynamic instability. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interactions with other organelles or microtubules uncovered new ER remodeling mechanisms, such as hitchhiking of the ER on motile organelles. Finally, ER-mitochondria contact sites were found to promote both mitochondrial fission and fusion.

Abstract: Summary
The biophysical features of neurons shape information processing in the brain. Cortical neurons are larger in humans than in other species, but it is unclear how their size affects synaptic integration. Here, we perform direct electrical recordings from human dendrites and report enhanced electrical compartmentalization in layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Compared to rat dendrites, distal human dendrites provide limited excitation to the soma, even in the presence of dendritic spikes. Human somas also exhibit less bursting due to reduced recruitment of dendritic electrogenesis. Finally, we find that decreased ion channel densities result in higher input resistance and underlie the lower coupling of human dendrites. We conclude that the increased length of human neurons alters their input-output properties, which will impact cortical computation.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms underlying sterol transport in mammalian cells are poorly understood. In particular, how cholesterol internalized from HDL is made available to the cell for storage or modification is unknown. Here, we describe three ER-resident proteins (Aster-A, -B, -C) that bind cholesterol and facilitate its removal from the plasma membrane. The crystal structure of the central domain of Aster-A broadly resembles the sterol-binding fold of mammalian StARD proteins, but sequence differences in the Aster pocket result in a distinct mode of ligand binding. The Aster N-terminal GRAM domain binds phosphatidylserine and mediates Aster recruitment to plasma membrane-ER contact sites in response to cholesterol accumulation in the plasma membrane. Mice lacking Aster-B are deficient in adrenal cholesterol ester storage and steroidogenesis because of an inability to transport cholesterol from SR-BI to the ER. These findings identify a nonvesicular pathway for plasma membrane to ER sterol trafficking in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
The dorsal raphe (DR) constitutes a major serotonergic input to the forebrain and modulates diverse functions and brain states, including mood, anxiety, and sensory and motor functions. Most functional studies to date have treated DR serotonin neurons as a single population. Using viral-genetic methods, we found that subcortical- and cortical-projecting serotonin neurons have distinct cell-body distributions within the DR and differentially co-express a vesicular glutamate transporter. Further, amygdala- and frontal-cortex-projecting DR serotonin neurons have largely complementary whole-brain collateralization patterns, receive biased inputs from presynaptic partners, and exhibit opposite responses to aversive stimuli. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that amygdala-projecting DR serotonin neurons promote anxiety-like behavior, whereas frontal-cortex-projecting neurons promote active coping in the face of challenge. These results provide compelling evidence that the DR serotonin system contains parallel sub-systems that differ in input and output connectivity, physiological response properties, and behavioral functions.

Abstract: Summary
Synapses are fundamental units of communication in the brain. The prototypical synapse-organizing complex neurexin-neuroligin mediates synapse development and function and is central to a shared genetic risk pathway in autism and schizophrenia. Neurexin’s role in synapse development is thought to be mediated purely by its protein domains, but we reveal a requirement for a rare glycan modification. Mice lacking heparan sulfate (HS) on neurexin-1 show reduced survival, as well as structural and functional deficits at central synapses. HS directly binds postsynaptic partners neuroligins and LRRTMs, revealing a dual binding mode involving intrinsic glycan and protein domains for canonical synapse-organizing complexes. Neurexin HS chains also bind novel ligands, potentially expanding the neurexin interactome to hundreds of HS-binding proteins. Because HS structure is heterogeneous, our findings indicate an additional dimension to neurexin diversity, provide a molecular basis for fine-tuning synaptic function, and open therapeutic directions targeting glycan-binding motifs critical for brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells were found to frequently express the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, particularly in immune-reactive environments and after therapeutic cancer vaccination. High-dimensional cluster analysis demonstrated that NKG2A marks a unique immune effector subset preferentially co-expressing the tissue-resident CD103 molecule, but not immune checkpoint inhibitors. To examine whether NKG2A represented an adaptive resistance mechanism to cancer vaccination, we blocked the receptor with an antibody and knocked out its ligand Qa-1b, the conserved ortholog of HLA-E, in four mouse tumor models. The impact of therapeutic vaccines was greatly potentiated by disruption of the NKG2A/Qa-1b axis even in a PD-1 refractory mouse model. NKG2A blockade therapy operated through CD8 T cells, but not NK cells. These findings indicate that NKG2A-blocking antibodies might improve clinical responses to therapeutic cancer vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian brain is composed of diverse, specialized cell populations. To systematically ascertain and learn from these cellular specializations, we used Drop-seq to profile RNA expression in 690,000 individual cells sampled from 9 regions of the adult mouse brain. We identified 565 transcriptionally distinct groups of cells using computational approaches developed to distinguish biological from technical signals. Cross-region analysis of these 565 cell populations revealed features of brain organization, including a gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components, patterns in the co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels, functional distinctions among the cells of the vasculature and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions. Systematic neuronal classifications for two complex basal ganglia nuclei and the striatum revealed a rare population of spiny projection neurons. This adult mouse brain cell atlas, accessible through interactive online software (DropViz), serves as a reference for development, disease, and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Human brain networks that encode variation in mood on naturalistic timescales remain largely unexplored. Here we combine multi-site, semi-chronic, intracranial electroencephalography recordings from the human limbic system with machine learning methods to discover a brain subnetwork that correlates with variation in individual subjects’ self-reported mood over days. First we defined the subnetworks that influence intrinsic brain dynamics by identifying regions that showed coordinated changes in spectral coherence. The most common subnetwork, found in 13 of 21 subjects, was characterized by β-frequency coherence (13-30 Hz) between the amygdala and hippocampus. Increased variability of this subnetwork correlated with worsening mood across these 13 subjects. Moreover, these subjects had significantly higher trait anxiety than the 8 of 21 for whom this amygdala-hippocampus subnetwork was absent. These results demonstrate an approach for extracting network-behavior relationships from complex datasets, and they reveal a conserved subnetwork associated with a psychological trait that significantly influences intrinsic brain dynamics and encodes fluctuations in mood.

Abstract: Summary
Activated T cells differentiate into functional subsets with distinct metabolic programs. Glutaminase (GLS) converts glutamine to glutamate to support the tricarboxylic acid cycle and redox and epigenetic reactions. Here, we identify a key role for GLS in T cell activation and specification. Though GLS deficiency diminished initial T cell activation and proliferation and impaired differentiation of Th17 cells, loss of GLS also increased Tbet to promote differentiation and effector function of CD4 Th1 and CD8 CTL cells. This was associated with altered chromatin accessibility and gene expression, including decreased PIK3IP1 in Th1 cells that sensitized to IL-2-mediated mTORC1 signaling. In vivo, GLS null T cells failed to drive Th17-inflammatory diseases, and Th1 cells had initially elevated function but exhausted over time. Transient GLS inhibition, however, led to increased Th1 and CTL T cell numbers. Glutamine metabolism thus has distinct roles to promote Th17 but constrain Th1 and CTL effector cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal niche cells instruct activity of tissue-resident stem and progenitor cell populations. Epithelial stem cells in hair follicles (HFs) have region-specific activity, which may arise from intrinsic cellular heterogeneity within mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) cells. Here we show that expression of Hoxc genes is sufficient to reprogram mesenchymal DP cells and alter the regenerative potential of epithelial stem cells. Hoxc gene expression in adult skin dermis closely correlates with regional HF regeneration patterns. Disrupting the region-specific expression patterns of Hoxc genes, by either decreasing their epigenetic repression via Bmi1 loss or inducing ectopic interactions of the Hoxc locus with an active epigenetic region, leads to precocious HF regeneration. We further show that a single Hoxc gene is sufficient to activate dormant DP niches and promote regional HF regeneration through canonical Wnt signaling. Altogether, these results reveal that Hoxc genes bestow mesenchymal niches with tissue-level heterogeneity and plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), in which stem cell clones dominate blood production, becomes increasingly common with age and can presage malignancy development. The conditions that promote ascendancy of particular clones are unclear. We found that mutations in PPM1D (protein phosphatase Mn2+/Mg2+-dependent 1D), a DNA damage response regulator that is frequently mutated in CH, were present in one-fifth of patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and strongly correlated with cisplatin exposure. Cell lines with hyperactive PPM1D mutations expand to outcompete normal cells after exposure to cytotoxic DNA damaging agents including cisplatin, and this effect was predominantly mediated by increased resistance to apoptosis. Moreover, heterozygous mutant Ppm1d hematopoietic cells outcompeted their wild-type counterparts in vivo after exposure to cisplatin and doxorubicin, but not during recovery from bone marrow transplantation. These findings establish the clinical relevance of PPM1D mutations in CH and the importance of studying mutation-treatment interactions.

Abstract: Summary
A highly multiplexed cytometric imaging approach, termed co-detection by indexing (CODEX), is used here to create multiplexed datasets of normal and lupus (MRL/lpr) murine spleens. CODEX iteratively visualizes antibody binding events using DNA barcodes, fluorescent dNTP analogs, and an in situ polymerization-based indexing procedure. An algorithmic pipeline for single-cell antigen quantification in tightly packed tissues was developed and used to overlay well-known morphological features with de novo characterization of lymphoid tissue architecture at a single-cell and cellular neighborhood levels. We observed an unexpected, profound impact of the cellular neighborhood on the expression of protein receptors on immune cells. By comparing normal murine spleen to spleens from animals with systemic autoimmune disease (MRL/lpr), extensive and previously uncharacterized splenic cell-interaction dynamics in the healthy versus diseased state was observed. The fidelity of multiplexed spatial cytometry demonstrated here allows for quantitative systemic characterization of tissue architecture in normal and clinically aberrant samples.

Abstract: Summary
Biological signaling networks use feedback control to dynamically adjust their operation in real time. Traditional static genetic methods such as gene knockouts or rescue experiments can often identify the existence of feedback interactions but are unable to determine what feedback dynamics are required. Here, we implement a new strategy, closed-loop optogenetic compensation (CLOC), to address this problem. Using a custom-built hardware and software infrastructure, CLOC monitors, in real time, the output of a pathway deleted for a feedback regulator. A minimal model uses these measurements to calculate and deliver—on the fly—an optogenetically enabled transcriptional input designed to compensate for the effects of the feedback deletion. Application of CLOC to the yeast pheromone response pathway revealed surprisingly distinct dynamic requirements for three well-studied feedback regulators. CLOC, a marriage of control theory and traditional genetics, presents a broadly applicable methodology for defining the dynamic function of biological feedback regulators.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis is a complex neurological disease, with ∼20% of risk heritability attributable to common genetic variants, including >230 identified by genome-wide association studies. Multiple strands of evidence suggest that much of the remaining heritability is also due to additive effects of common variants rather than epistasis between these variants or mutations exclusive to individual families. Here, we show in 68,379 cases and controls that up to 5% of this heritability is explained by low-frequency variation in gene coding sequence. We identify four novel genes driving MS risk independently of common-variant signals, highlighting key pathogenic roles for regulatory T cell homeostasis and regulation, IFNγ biology, and NFκB signaling. As low-frequency variants do not show substantial linkage disequilibrium with other variants, and as coding variants are more interpretable and experimentally tractable than non-coding variation, our discoveries constitute a rich resource for dissecting the pathobiology of MS.

Abstract: Summary
Many US immigrant populations develop metabolic diseases post immigration, but the causes are not well understood. Although the microbiome plays a role in metabolic disease, there have been no studies measuring the effects of US immigration on the gut microbiome. We collected stool, dietary recalls, and anthropometrics from 514 Hmong and Karen individuals living in Thailand and the United States, including first- and second-generation immigrants and 19 Karen individuals sampled before and after immigration, as well as from 36 US-born European American individuals. Using 16S and deep shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, we found that migration from a non-Western country to the United States is associated with immediate loss of gut microbiome diversity and function in which US-associated strains and functions displace native strains and functions. These effects increase with duration of US residence and are compounded by obesity and across generations.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis generates mature male gametes and is critical for the proper transmission of genetic information between generations. However, the developmental landscapes of human spermatogenesis remain unknown. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis for 2,854 testicular cells from donors with normal spermatogenesis and 174 testicular cells from one nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) donor. A hierarchical model was established, which was characterized by the sequential and stepwise development of three spermatogonia subtypes, seven spermatocyte subtypes, and four spermatid subtypes. Further analysis identified several stage-specific marker genes of human germ cells, such as HMGA1, PIWIL4, TEX29, SCML1, and CCDC112. Moreover, we identified altered gene expression patterns in the testicular somatic cells of one NOA patient via scRNA-seq analysis, paving the way for further diagnosis of male infertility. Our work allows for the reconstruction of transcriptional programs inherent to sequential cell fate transition during human spermatogenesis and has implications for deciphering male-related reproductive disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Protein N-glycosylation is a widespread post-translational modification. The first committed step in this process is catalysed by dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-phosphotransferase DPAGT1 (GPT/E.C. 2.7.8.15). Missense DPAGT1 variants cause congenital myasthenic syndrome and disorders of glycosylation. In addition, naturally-occurring bactericidal nucleoside analogues such as tunicamycin are toxic to eukaryotes due to DPAGT1 inhibition, preventing their clinical use. Our structures of DPAGT1 with the substrate UDP-GlcNAc and tunicamycin reveal substrate binding modes, suggest a mechanism of catalysis, provide an understanding of how mutations modulate activity (thus causing disease) and allow design of non-toxic “lipid-altered” tunicamycins. The structure-tuned activity of these analogues against several bacterial targets allowed the design of potent antibiotics for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, enabling treatment in vitro, in cellulo and in vivo, providing a promising new class of antimicrobial drug.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria utilize CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems for protection from bacteriophages (phages), and some phages produce anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit immune function. Despite thorough mechanistic and structural information for some Acr proteins, how they are deployed and utilized by a phage during infection is unknown. Here, we show that Acr production does not guarantee phage replication when faced with CRISPR-Cas immunity, but instead, infections fail when phage population numbers fall below a critical threshold. Infections succeed only if a sufficient Acr dose is contributed to a single cell by multiple phage genomes. The production of Acr proteins by phage genomes that fail to replicate leave the cell immunosuppressed, which predisposes the cell for successful infection by other phages in the population. This altruistic mechanism for CRISPR-Cas inhibition demonstrates inter-virus cooperation that may also manifest in other host-parasite interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal theta oscillations were proposed to be important for multiple functions, including memory and temporal coding of position. However, previous findings from bats have questioned these proposals by reporting absence of theta rhythmicity in bat hippocampal formation. Does this mean that temporal coding is unique to rodent hippocampus and does not generalize to other species? Here, we report that, surprisingly, bat hippocampal neurons do exhibit temporal coding similar to rodents, albeit without any continuous oscillations at the 1–20 Hz range. Bat neurons exhibited very strong locking to the non-rhythmic fluctuations of the field potential, such that neurons were synchronized together despite the absence of oscillations. Further, some neurons exhibited “phase precession” and phase coding of the bat’s position—with spike phases shifting earlier as the animal moved through the place field. This demonstrates an unexpected type of neural coding in the mammalian brain—nonoscillatory phase coding—and highlights the importance of synchrony and temporal coding for hippocampal function across species.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations or aberrant upregulation of EZH2 occur frequently in human cancers, yet clinical benefits of EZH2 inhibitor (EZH2i) remain unsatisfactory and limited to certain hematological malignancies. We profile global posttranslational histone modification changes across a large panel of cancer cell lines with various sensitivities to EZH2i. We report here oncogenic transcriptional reprogramming mediated by MLL1’s interaction with the p300/CBP complex, which directs H3K27me loss to reciprocal H3K27ac gain and restricts EZH2i response. Concurrent inhibition of H3K27me and H3K27ac results in transcriptional repression and MAPK pathway dependency in cancer subsets. In preclinical models encompassing a broad spectrum of EZH2-aberrant solid tumors, a combination of EZH2 and BRD4 inhibitors, or a triple-combination including MAPK inhibition display robust efficacy with very tolerable toxicity. Our results suggest an attractive precision treatment strategy for EZH2-aberrant tumors on the basis of tumor-intrinsic MLL1 expression and concurrent inhibition of epigenetic crosstalk and feedback MAPK activation.

Abstract: Summary
The immune system is critical in modulating cancer progression, but knowledge of immune composition, phenotype, and interactions with tumor is limited. We used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) to simultaneously quantify in situ expression of 36 proteins covering identity, function, and immune regulation at sub-cellular resolution in 41 triple-negative breast cancer patients. Multi-step processing, including deep-learning-based segmentation, revealed variability in the composition of tumor-immune populations across individuals, reconciled by overall immune infiltration and enriched co-occurrence of immune subpopulations and checkpoint expression. Spatial enrichment analysis showed immune mixed and compartmentalized tumors, coinciding with expression of PD1, PD-L1, and IDO in a cell-type- and location-specific manner. Ordered immune structures along the tumor-immune border were associated with compartmentalization and linked to survival. These data demonstrate organization in the tumor-immune microenvironment that is structured in cellular composition, spatial arrangement, and regulatory-protein expression and provide a framework to apply multiplexed imaging to immune oncology.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary soluble fibers are fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are considered broadly health-promoting. Accordingly, consumption of such fibers ameliorates metabolic syndrome. However, incorporating soluble fiber inulin, but not insoluble fiber, into a compositionally defined diet, induced icteric hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Such HCC was microbiota-dependent and observed in multiple strains of dysbiotic mice but not in germ-free nor antibiotics-treated mice. Furthermore, consumption of an inulin-enriched high-fat diet induced both dysbiosis and HCC in wild-type (WT) mice. Inulin-induced HCC progressed via early onset of cholestasis, hepatocyte death, followed by neutrophilic inflammation in liver. Pharmacologic inhibition of fermentation or depletion of fermenting bacteria markedly reduced intestinal SCFA and prevented HCC. Intervening with cholestyramine to prevent reabsorption of bile acids also conferred protection against such HCC. Thus, its benefits notwithstanding, enrichment of foods with fermentable fiber should be approached with great caution as it may increase risk of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
A broad molecular framework of how neural stem cells are specified toward astrocyte fate during brain development has proven elusive. Here we perform comprehensive and integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to delineate gene regulatory programs that drive the developmental trajectory from mouse embryonic stem cells to astrocytes. We report molecularly distinct phases of astrogliogenesis that exhibit stage- and lineage-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures with unique primed and active chromatin regions, thereby revealing regulatory elements and transcriptional programs underlying astrocyte generation and maturation. By searching for transcription factors that function at these elements, we identified NFIA and ATF3 as drivers of astrocyte differentiation from neural precursor cells while RUNX2 promotes astrocyte maturation. These transcription factors facilitate stage-specific gene expression programs by switching the chromatin state of their target regulatory elements from primed to active. Altogether, these findings provide integrated insights into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms steering the trajectory of astrogliogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The embryonic stem cell (ESC) transition from naive to primed pluripotency is marked by major changes in cellular properties and developmental potential. ISY1 regulates microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, yet its role and relevance to ESC biology remain unknown. Here, we find that highly dynamic ISY1 expression during the naive-to-primed ESC transition defines a specific phase of “poised” pluripotency characterized by distinct miRNA and mRNA transcriptomes and widespread poised cell contribution to mouse chimeras. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments reveal that ISY1 promotes exit from the naive state and is necessary and sufficient to induce and maintain poised pluripotency, and that persistent ISY1 overexpression inhibits the transition from the naive to the primed state. We identify a large subset of ISY1-dependent miRNAs that can rescue the inability of miRNA-deficient ESCs to establish the poised state and transition to the primed state. Thus, dynamic ISY1 regulates poised pluripotency through miRNAs to control ESC fate.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental challenge of biology is to understand the vast heterogeneity of cells, particularly how cellular composition, structure, and morphology are linked to cellular physiology. Unfortunately, conventional technologies are limited in uncovering these relations. We present a machine-intelligence technology based on a radically different architecture that realizes real-time image-based intelligent cell sorting at an unprecedented rate. This technology, which we refer to as intelligent image-activated cell sorting, integrates high-throughput cell microscopy, focusing, and sorting on a hybrid software-hardware data-management infrastructure, enabling real-time automated operation for data acquisition, data processing, decision-making, and actuation. We use it to demonstrate real-time sorting of microalgal and blood cells based on intracellular protein localization and cell-cell interaction from large heterogeneous populations for studying photosynthesis and atherothrombosis, respectively. The technology is highly versatile and expected to enable machine-based scientific discovery in biological, pharmaceutical, and medical sciences.

Abstract: Summary
The exchange of metabolites between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol depends on β-barrel channels in the outer membrane and α-helical carrier proteins in the inner membrane. The essential translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) chaperones escort these proteins through the intermembrane space, but the structural and mechanistic details remain elusive. We have used an integrated structural biology approach to reveal the functional principle of TIM chaperones. Multiple clamp-like binding sites hold the mitochondrial membrane proteins in a translocation-competent elongated form, thus mimicking characteristics of co-translational membrane insertion. The bound preprotein undergoes conformational dynamics within the chaperone binding clefts, pointing to a multitude of dynamic local binding events. Mutations in these binding sites cause cell death or growth defects associated with impairment of carrier and β-barrel protein biogenesis. Our work reveals how a single mitochondrial “transfer-chaperone” system is able to guide α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins in a “nascent chain-like” conformation through a ribosome-free compartment.

Abstract: Summary
We report here a simple and global strategy to map out gene functions and target pathways of drugs, toxins, or other small molecules based on “homomer dynamics” protein-fragment complementation assays (hdPCA). hdPCA measures changes in self-association (homomerization) of over 3,500 yeast proteins in yeast grown under different conditions. hdPCA complements genetic interaction measurements while eliminating the confounding effects of gene ablation. We demonstrate that hdPCA accurately predicts the effects of two longevity and health span-affecting drugs, the immunosuppressant rapamycin and the type 2 diabetes drug metformin, on cellular pathways. We also discovered an unsuspected global cellular response to metformin that resembles iron deficiency and includes a change in protein-bound iron levels. This discovery opens a new avenue to investigate molecular mechanisms for the prevention or treatment of diabetes, cancers, and other chronic diseases of aging.

Abstract: Summary
Lung development and function arises from the interactions between diverse cell types and lineages. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we characterize the cellular composition of the lung during development and identify vast dynamics in cell composition and their molecular characteristics. Analyzing 818 ligand-receptor interaction pairs within and between cell lineages, we identify broadly interacting cells, including AT2, innate lymphocytes (ILCs), and basophils. Using interleukin (IL)-33 receptor knockout mice and in vitro experiments, we show that basophils establish a lung-specific function imprinted by IL-33 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), characterized by unique signaling of cytokines and growth factors important for stromal, epithelial, and myeloid cell fates. Antibody-depletion strategies, diphtheria toxin-mediated selective depletion of basophils, and co-culture studies show that lung resident basophils are important regulators of alveolar macrophage development and function. Together, our study demonstrates how whole-tissue signaling interaction map on the single-cell level can broaden our understanding of cellular networks in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian liver possesses a remarkable regenerative ability. Two modes of damage response have been described: (1) The “oval cell” response emanates from the biliary tree when all hepatocytes are affected by chronic liver disease. (2) A massive, proliferative response of mature hepatocytes occurs upon acute liver damage such as partial hepatectomy (PHx). While the oval cell response has been captured in vitro by growing organoids from cholangiocytes, the hepatocyte proliferative response has not been recapitulated in culture. Here, we describe the establishment of a long-term 3D organoid culture system for mouse and human primary hepatocytes. Organoids can be established from single hepatocytes and grown for multiple months, while retaining key morphological, functional and gene expression features. Transcriptional profiles of the organoids resemble those of proliferating hepatocytes after PHx. Human hepatocyte organoids proliferate extensively after engraftment into mice and thus recapitulate the proliferative damage-response of hepatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR pools are being widely employed to identify gene functions. However, current technology, which utilizes DNA as barcodes, permits limited phenotyping and bulk-cell resolution. To enable novel screening capabilities, we developed a barcoding system operating at the protein level. We synthesized modules encoding triplet combinations of linear epitopes to generate >100 unique protein barcodes (Pro-Codes). Pro-Code-expressing vectors were introduced into cells and analyzed by CyTOF mass cytometry. Using just 14 antibodies, we detected 364 Pro-Code populations; establishing the largest set of protein-based reporters. By pairing each Pro-Code with a different CRISPR, we simultaneously analyzed multiple phenotypic markers, including phospho-signaling, on dozens of knockouts. Pro-Code/CRISPR screens found two interferon-stimulated genes, the immunoproteasome component Psmb8 and a chaperone Rtp4, are important for antigen-dependent immune editing of cancer cells and identified Socs1 as a negative regulator of Pd-l1. The Pro-Code technology enables simultaneous high-dimensional protein-level phenotyping of 100s of genes with single-cell resolution.

Abstract: Summary
The mesoderm arises from pluripotent epiblasts and differentiates into multiple lineages; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Tbx6 is enriched in the paraxial mesoderm and is implicated in somite formation, but its function in other mesoderms remains elusive. Here, using direct reprogramming-based screening, single-cell RNA-seq in mouse embryos, and directed cardiac differentiation in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), we demonstrated that Tbx6 induces nascent mesoderm from PSCs and determines cardiovascular and somite lineage specification via its temporal expression. Tbx6 knockout in mouse PSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology inhibited mesoderm and cardiovascular differentiation, whereas transient Tbx6 expression induced mesoderm and cardiovascular specification from mouse and human PSCs via direct upregulation of Mesp1, repression of Sox2, and activation of BMP/Nodal/Wnt signaling. Notably, prolonged Tbx6 expression suppressed cardiac differentiation and induced somite lineages, including skeletal muscle and chondrocytes. Thus, Tbx6 is critical for mesoderm induction and subsequent lineage diversification.

Abstract: Summary
Acetate is a major nutrient that supports acetyl-coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) metabolism and thus lipogenesis and protein acetylation. However, its source is unclear. Here, we report that pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis and key node in central carbon metabolism, quantitatively generates acetate in mammals. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced in the context of nutritional excess, such as during hyperactive glucose metabolism. Conversion of pyruvate to acetate occurs through two mechanisms: (1) coupling to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (2) neomorphic enzyme activity from keto acid dehydrogenases that enable function as pyruvate decarboxylases. Further, we demonstrate that de novo acetate production sustains Ac-CoA pools and cell proliferation in limited metabolic environments, such as during mitochondrial dysfunction or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) deficiency. By virtue of de novo acetate production being coupled to mitochondrial metabolism, there are numerous possible regulatory mechanisms and links to pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
Nervous system function depends on proper myelination for insulation and critical trophic support for axons. Myelination is tightly regulated spatially and temporally, but how it is controlled molecularly remains largely unknown. Here, we identified key molecular mechanisms governing the regional and temporal specificity of CNS myelination. We show that transcription factor EB (TFEB) is highly expressed by differentiating oligodendrocytes and that its loss causes precocious and ectopic myelination in many parts of the murine brain. TFEB functions cell-autonomously through PUMA induction and Bax-Bak activation to promote programmed cell death of a subset of premyelinating oligodendrocytes, allowing selective elimination of oligodendrocytes in normally unmyelinated brain regions. This pathway is conserved across diverse brain areas and is critical for myelination timing. Our findings define an oligodendrocyte-intrinsic mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal specificity of CNS myelination, shedding light on how myelinating glia sculpt the nervous system during development.

Abstract: Summary
We have uncovered the existence of extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated signaling between cell types within the adipose tissue (AT) proper. This phenomenon became evident in our attempts at generating an adipocyte-specific knockout of caveolin 1 (cav1) protein. Although we effectively ablated the CAV1 gene in adipocytes, cav1 protein remained abundant. With the use of newly generated mouse models, we show that neighboring endothelial cells (ECs) transfer cav1-containing EVs to adipocytes in vivo, which reciprocate by releasing EVs to ECs. AT-derived EVs contain proteins and lipids capable of modulating cellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, this mechanism facilitates transfer of plasma constituents from ECs to the adipocyte. The transfer event is physiologically regulated by fasting/refeeding and obesity, suggesting EVs participate in the tissue response to changes in the systemic nutrient state. This work offers new insights into the complex signaling mechanisms that exist among adipocytes, stromal vascular cells, and, potentially, distal organs.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic drivers of cancer can be dysregulated through epigenetic modifications of DNA. Although the critical role of DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the regulation of transcription is recognized, the functions of other non-canonical DNA modifications remain obscure. Here, we report the identification of novel N6-methyladenine (N6-mA) DNA modifications in human tissues and implicate this epigenetic mark in human disease, specifically the highly malignant brain cancer glioblastoma. Glioblastoma markedly upregulated N6-mA levels, which co-localized with heterochromatic histone modifications, predominantly H3K9me3. N6-mA levels were dynamically regulated by the DNA demethylase ALKBH1, depletion of which led to transcriptional silencing of oncogenic pathways through decreasing chromatin accessibility. Targeting the N6-mA regulator ALKBH1 in patient-derived human glioblastoma models inhibited tumor cell proliferation and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice, supporting this novel DNA modification as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma. Collectively, our results uncover a novel epigenetic node in cancer through the DNA modification N6-mA.

Abstract: Summary
Light exerts a range of powerful biological effects beyond image vision, including mood and learning regulation. While the source of photic information affecting mood and cognitive functions is well established, viz. intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), the central mediators are unknown. Here, we reveal that the direct effects of light on learning and mood utilize distinct ipRGC output streams. ipRGCs that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) mediate the effects of light on learning, independently of the SCN’s pacemaker function. Mood regulation by light, on the other hand, requires an SCN-independent pathway linking ipRGCs to a previously unrecognized thalamic region, termed perihabenular nucleus (PHb). The PHb is integrated in a distinctive circuitry with mood-regulating centers and is both necessary and sufficient for driving the effects of light on affective behavior. Together, these results provide new insights into the neural basis required for light to influence mood and learning.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) requires orchestration of dynamic gene regulatory networks during stepwise fate transitions but often generates immature cell types that do not fully recapitulate properties of their adult counterparts, suggesting incomplete activation of key transcriptional networks. We performed extensive single-cell transcriptomic analyses to map fate choices and gene expression programs during cardiac differentiation of hPSCs and identified strategies to improve in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation. Utilizing genetic gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we found that hypertrophic signaling is not effectively activated during monolayer-based cardiac differentiation, thereby preventing expression of HOPX and its activation of downstream genes that govern late stages of cardiomyocyte maturation. This study therefore provides a key transcriptional roadmap of in vitro cardiac differentiation at single-cell resolution, revealing fundamental mechanisms underlying heart development and differentiation of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Approximately half of human genes generate mRNAs with alternative 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs). Through 3′UTR-mediated protein-protein interactions, alternative 3′UTRs enable multi-functionality of proteins with identical amino acid sequence. While studying how information on protein features is transferred from 3′UTRs to proteins, we discovered that the broadly expressed RNA-binding protein TIS11B forms a membraneless organelle, called TIS granule, that enriches membrane protein-encoding mRNAs with multiple AU-rich elements. TIS granules form a reticular meshwork intertwined with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The association between TIS granules and the ER creates a subcellular compartment—the TIGER domain—with a biophysically and biochemically distinct environment from the cytoplasm. This compartment promotes 3′UTR-mediated interaction of SET with membrane proteins, thus allowing increased surface expression and functional diversity of proteins, including CD47 and PD-L1. The TIGER domain is a subcellular compartment that enables formation of specific and functionally relevant protein-protein interactions that cannot be established outside.

Abstract: Summary
More than 25 inherited human disorders are caused by the unstable expansion of repetitive DNA sequences termed short tandem repeats (STRs). A fundamental unresolved question is why some STRs are susceptible to pathologic expansion, whereas thousands of repeat tracts across the human genome are relatively stable. Here, we discover that nearly all disease-associated STRs (daSTRs) are located at boundaries demarcating 3D chromatin domains. We identify a subset of boundaries with markedly higher CpG island density compared to the rest of the genome. daSTRs specifically localize to ultra-high-density CpG island boundaries, suggesting they might be hotspots for epigenetic misregulation or topological disruption linked to STR expansion. Fragile X syndrome patients exhibit severe boundary disruption in a manner that correlates with local loss of CTCF occupancy and the degree of FMR1 silencing. Our data uncover higher-order chromatin architecture as a new dimension in understanding repeat expansion disorders.

Abstract: Summary
When DNA is unwound during replication, it becomes overtwisted and forms positive supercoils in front of the translocating DNA polymerase. Unless removed or dissipated, this superhelical tension can impede replication elongation. Topoisomerases, including gyrase and topoisomerase IV in bacteria, are required to relax positive supercoils ahead of DNA polymerase but may not be sufficient for replication. Here, we find that GapR, a chromosome structuring protein in Caulobacter crescentus, is required to complete DNA replication. GapR associates in vivo with positively supercoiled chromosomal DNA, and our biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that GapR forms a dimer-of-dimers that fully encircles overtwisted DNA. Further, we show that GapR stimulates gyrase and topo IV to relax positive supercoils, thereby enabling DNA replication. Analogous chromosome structuring proteins that locate to the overtwisted DNA in front of replication forks may be present in other organisms, similarly helping to recruit and stimulate topoisomerases during DNA replication.

Abstract: Summary
During aging, stromal functions are thought to be impaired, but little is known whether this stems from changes of fibroblasts. Using population- and single-cell transcriptomics, as well as long-term lineage tracing, we studied whether murine dermal fibroblasts are altered during physiological aging under different dietary regimes that affect longevity. We show that the identity of old fibroblasts becomes undefined, with the fibroblast states present in young skin no longer clearly demarcated. In addition, old fibroblasts not only reduce the expression of genes involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix, but also gain adipogenic traits, paradoxically becoming more similar to neonatal pro-adipogenic fibroblasts. These alterations are sensitive to systemic metabolic changes: long-term caloric restriction reversibly prevents them, whereas a high-fat diet potentiates them. Our results therefore highlight loss of cell identity and the acquisition of adipogenic traits as a mechanism underlying cellular aging, which is influenced by systemic metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
While many genetic variants have been associated with risk for human diseases, how these variants affect gene expression in various cell types remains largely unknown. To address this gap, the DICE (database of immune cell expression, expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs], and epigenomics) project was established. Considering all human immune cell types and conditions studied, we identified cis-eQTLs for a total of 12,254 unique genes, which represent 61% of all protein-coding genes expressed in these cell types. Strikingly, a large fraction (41%) of these genes showed a strong cis-association with genotype only in a single cell type. We also found that biological sex is associated with major differences in immune cell gene expression in a highly cell-specific manner. These datasets will help reveal the effects of disease risk-associated genetic polymorphisms on specific immune cell types, providing mechanistic insights into how they might influence pathogenesis (https://dice-database.org).

Abstract: Summary
Tracheal and esophageal disorders are prevalent in humans and difficult to accurately model in mice. We therefore established a three-dimensional organoid model of esophageal development through directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. Sequential manipulation of bone morphogenic protein (BMP), Wnt, and RA signaling pathways was required to pattern definitive endoderm into foregut, anterior foregut (AFG), and dorsal AFG spheroids. Dorsal AFG spheroids grown in a 3D matrix formed human esophageal organoids (HEOs), and HEO cells could be transitioned into two-dimensional cultures and grown as esophageal organotypic rafts. In both configurations, esophageal tissues had proliferative basal progenitors and a differentiated stratified squamous epithelium. Using HEO cultures to model human esophageal birth defects, we identified that Sox2 promotes esophageal specification in part through repressing Wnt signaling in dorsal AFG and promoting survival. Consistently, Sox2 ablation in mice causes esophageal agenesis. Thus, HEOs present a powerful platform for modeling human pathologies and tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) promotes transcriptional elongation through RNAPII pause release. We now report that CDK9 is also essential for maintaining gene silencing at heterochromatic loci. Through a live cell drug screen with genetic confirmation, we discovered that CDK9 inhibition reactivates epigenetically silenced genes in cancer, leading to restored tumor suppressor gene expression, cell differentiation, and activation of endogenous retrovirus genes. CDK9 inhibition dephosphorylates the SWI/SNF protein BRG1, which contributes to gene reactivation. By optimization through gene expression, we developed a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor (MC180295, IC50 = 5 nM) that has broad anti-cancer activity in vitro and is effective in in vivo cancer models. Additionally, CDK9 inhibition sensitizes to the immune checkpoint inhibitor α-PD-1 in vivo, making it an excellent target for epigenetic therapy of cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Budding yeasts (subphylum Saccharomycotina) are found in every biome and are as genetically diverse as plants or animals. To understand budding yeast evolution, we analyzed the genomes of 332 yeast species, including 220 newly sequenced ones, which represent nearly one-third of all known budding yeast diversity. Here, we establish a robust genus-level phylogeny comprising 12 major clades, infer the timescale of diversification from the Devonian period to the present, quantify horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and reconstruct the evolution of 45 metabolic traits and the metabolic toolkit of the budding yeast common ancestor (BYCA). We infer that BYCA was metabolically complex and chronicle the tempo and mode of genomic and phenotypic evolution across the subphylum, which is characterized by very low HGT levels and widespread losses of traits and the genes that control them. More generally, our results argue that reductive evolution is a major mode of evolutionary diversification.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is a major driver of cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevailing view is that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis or cirrhosis are required for HCC in obesity. Here, we report that NASH and fibrosis and HCC in obesity can be dissociated. We show that the oxidative hepatic environment in obesity inactivates the STAT-1 and STAT-3 phosphatase T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) and increases STAT-1 and STAT-3 signaling. TCPTP deletion in hepatocytes promoted T cell recruitment and ensuing NASH and fibrosis as well as HCC in obese C57BL/6 mice that normally do not develop NASH and fibrosis or HCC. Attenuating the enhanced STAT-1 signaling prevented T cell recruitment and NASH and fibrosis but did not prevent HCC. By contrast, correcting STAT-3 signaling prevented HCC without affecting NASH and fibrosis. TCPTP-deletion in hepatocytes also markedly accelerated HCC in mice treated with a chemical carcinogen that promotes HCC without NASH and fibrosis. Our studies reveal how obesity-associated hepatic oxidative stress can independently contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH, fibrosis, and HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) produce durable responses in some melanoma patients, but many patients derive no clinical benefit, and the molecular underpinnings of such resistance remain elusive. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from 33 melanoma tumors and computational analyses to interrogate malignant cell states that promote immune evasion. We identified a resistance program expressed by malignant cells that is associated with T cell exclusion and immune evasion. The program is expressed prior to immunotherapy, characterizes cold niches in situ, and predicts clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in an independent cohort of 112 melanoma patients. CDK4/6-inhibition represses this program in individual malignant cells, induces senescence, and reduces melanoma tumor outgrowth in mouse models in vivo when given in combination with immunotherapy. Our study provides a high-resolution landscape of ICI-resistant cell states, identifies clinically predictive signatures, and suggests new therapeutic strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems confer an adaptive immunity against viruses. Following viral injection, Cas1-Cas2 integrates segments of the viral genome (spacers) into the CRISPR locus. In type I CRISPR-Cas systems, efficient “primed” spacer acquisition and viral degradation (interference) require both the Cascade complex and the Cas3 helicase/nuclease. Here, we present single-molecule characterization of the Thermobifida fusca (Tfu) primed acquisition complex (PAC). We show that TfuCascade rapidly samples non-specific DNA via facilitated one-dimensional diffusion. Cas3 loads at target-bound Cascade and the Cascade/Cas3 complex translocates via a looped DNA intermediate. Cascade/Cas3 complexes stall at diverse protein roadblocks, resulting in a double strand break at the stall site. In contrast, Cas1-Cas2 samples DNA transiently via 3D collisions. Moreover, Cas1-Cas2 associates with Cascade and translocates with Cascade/Cas3, forming the PAC. PACs can displace different protein roadblocks, suggesting a mechanism for long-range spacer acquisition. This work provides a molecular basis for the coordinated steps in CRISPR-based adaptive immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation of human hepatocytes (HHs) holds significant potential for treating liver diseases. However, the supply of transplantable HHs is severely constrained by limited donor availability and compromised capacity for in vitro expansion. In response to chronic injury, some HHs are reprogrammed into proliferative cells that express both hepatocyte and progenitor markers, suggesting exploitable strategies for expanding HHs in vitro. Here, we report defined medium conditions that allow 10,000-fold expansion of HHs. These proliferating HHs are bi-phenotypic, partially retaining hepatic features while gaining expression of progenitor-associated genes. Importantly, these cells engraft into injured mouse liver at a level comparable to primary HHs, and they undergo maturation following transplantation in vivo or differentiation in vitro. Thus, this study provides a protocol that enables large-scale expansion of transplantable HHs, which could be further developed for modeling and treating human liver disease.

Abstract: Summary
In the small intestine, a niche of accessory cell types supports the generation of mature epithelial cell types from intestinal stem cells (ISCs). It is unclear, however, if and how immune cells in the niche affect ISC fate or the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify MHC class II (MHCII) machinery enrichment in two subsets of Lgr5+ ISCs. We show that MHCII+ Lgr5+ ISCs are non-conventional antigen-presenting cells in co-cultures with CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. Stimulation of intestinal organoids with key Th cytokines affects Lgr5+ ISC renewal and differentiation in opposing ways: pro-inflammatory signals promote differentiation, while regulatory cells and cytokines reduce it. In vivo genetic perturbation of Th cells or MHCII expression on Lgr5+ ISCs impacts epithelial cell differentiation and IEC fate during infection. These interactions between Th cells and Lgr5+ ISCs, thus, orchestrate tissue-wide responses to external signals.

Abstract: Summary
Comprehensive identification of factors that can specify neuronal fate could provide valuable insights into lineage specification and reprogramming, but systematic interrogation of transcription factors, and their interactions with each other, has proven technically challenging. We developed a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) approach to systematically identify regulators of neuronal-fate specification. We activated expression of all endogenous transcription factors and other regulators via a pooled CRISPRa screen in embryonic stem cells, revealing genes including epigenetic regulators such as Ezh2 that can induce neuronal fate. Systematic CRISPR-based activation of factor pairs allowed us to generate a genetic interaction map for neuronal differentiation, with confirmation of top individual and combinatorial hits as bona fide inducers of neuronal fate. Several factor pairs could directly reprogram fibroblasts into neurons, which shared similar transcriptional programs with endogenous neurons. This study provides an unbiased discovery approach for systematic identification of genes that drive cell-fate acquisition.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblasts are an essential cellular and structural component of our organs. Despite several advances, the critical behaviors that fibroblasts utilize to maintain their homeostasis in vivo have remained unclear. Here, by tracking the same skin fibroblasts in live mice, we show that fibroblast position is stable over time and that this stability is maintained despite the loss of neighboring fibroblasts. In contrast, fibroblast membranes are dynamic during homeostasis and extend to fill the space of lost neighboring fibroblasts in a Rac1-dependent manner. Positional stability is sustained during aging despite a progressive accumulation of gaps in fibroblast nuclei organization, while membrane occupancy continues to be maintained. This work defines positional stability and cell occupancy as key principles of skin fibroblast homeostasis in vivo, throughout the lifespan of mice, and identifies membrane extension in the absence of migration as the core cellular mechanism to carry out these principles.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane contact sites (MCSs) mark positions where endosomes undergo fission for cargo sorting. To define the role of ER at this unique MCS, we targeted a promiscuous biotin ligase to cargo-sorting domains on endosome buds. This strategy identified the ER membrane protein TMCC1, a member of a conserved protein family. TMCC1 concentrates at the ER-endosome MCSs that are spatially and temporally linked to endosome fission. When TMCC1 is depleted, endosome morphology is normal, buds still form, but ER-associated bud fission and subsequent cargo sorting to the Golgi are impaired. We find that the endosome-localized actin regulator Coronin 1C is required for ER-associated fission of actin-dependent cargo-sorting domains. Coronin 1C is recruited to endosome buds independently of TMCC1, while TMCC1/ER recruitment requires Coronin 1C. This link between TMCC1 and Coronin 1C suggests that the timing of TMCC1-dependent ER recruitment is tightly regulated to occur after cargo has been properly sequestered into the bud.

Abstract: Summary
Motivated by the clinical observation that interruption of the mevalonate pathway stimulates immune responses, we hypothesized that this pathway may function as a druggable target for vaccine adjuvant discovery. We found that lipophilic statin drugs and rationally designed bisphosphonates that target three distinct enzymes in the mevalonate pathway have potent adjuvant activities in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. These inhibitors function independently of conventional “danger sensing.” Instead, they inhibit the geranylgeranylation of small GTPases, including Rab5 in antigen-presenting cells, resulting in arrested endosomal maturation, prolonged antigen retention, enhanced antigen presentation, and T cell activation. Additionally, inhibiting the mevalonate pathway enhances antigen-specific anti-tumor immunity, inducing both Th1 and cytolytic T cell responses. As demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models, the mevalonate pathway inhibitors are robust for cancer vaccinations and synergize with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our research thus defines the mevalonate pathway as a druggable target for vaccine adjuvants and cancer immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Rodent research delineates how the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central amygdala (CeA) control defensive behaviors, but translation of these findings to humans is needed. Here, we compare humans with natural-selective bilateral BLA lesions to rats with a chemogenetically silenced BLA. We find, across species, an essential role for the BLA in the selection of active escape over passive freezing during exposure to imminent yet escapable threat (Timm). In response to Timm, BLA-damaged humans showed increased startle potentiation and BLA-silenced rats demonstrated increased startle potentiation, freezing, and reduced escape behavior as compared to controls. Neuroimaging in humans suggested that the BLA reduces passive defensive responses by inhibiting the brainstem via the CeA. Indeed, Timm conditioning potentiated BLA projections onto an inhibitory CeA pathway, and pharmacological activation of this pathway rescued deficient Timm responses in BLA-silenced rats. Our data reveal how the BLA, via the CeA, adaptively regulates escape behavior from imminent threat and that this mechanism is evolutionary conserved across rodents and humans.

Abstract: Summary
Mammals encode ∼5,000 integral membrane proteins that need to be inserted in a defined topology at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Here, we found that efficient biogenesis of β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) requires the conserved ER membrane protein complex (EMC). Reconstitution studies of β1AR biogenesis narrowed the EMC requirement to the co-translational insertion of the first transmembrane domain (TMD). Without EMC, a proportion of TMD1 inserted in an inverted orientation or failed altogether. Purified EMC and SRP receptor were sufficient for correctly oriented TMD1 insertion, while the Sec61 translocon was necessary for insertion of the next TMD. Enforcing TMD1 topology with an N-terminal signal peptide bypassed the EMC requirement for insertion in vitro and restored efficient biogenesis of multiple GPCRs in EMC-knockout cells. Thus, EMC inserts TMDs co-translationally and cooperates with the Sec61 translocon to ensure accurate topogenesis of many membrane proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Human T cells are central effectors of immunity and cancer immunotherapy. CRISPR-based functional studies in T cells could prioritize novel targets for drug development and improve the design of genetically reprogrammed cell-based therapies. However, large-scale CRISPR screens have been challenging in primary human cells. We developed a new method, single guide RNA (sgRNA) lentiviral infection with Cas9 protein electroporation (SLICE), to identify regulators of stimulation responses in primary human T cells. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens identified essential T cell receptor signaling components and genes that negatively tune proliferation following stimulation. Targeted ablation of individual candidate genes characterized hits and identified perturbations that enhanced cancer cell killing. SLICE coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed signature stimulation-response gene programs altered by key genetic perturbations. SLICE genome-wide screening was also adaptable to identify mediators of immunosuppression, revealing genes controlling responses to adenosine signaling. The SLICE platform enables unbiased discovery and characterization of functional gene targets in primary cells.

Abstract: Summary
Roots of healthy plants are inhabited by soil-derived bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes that have evolved independently in distinct kingdoms of life. How these microorganisms interact and to what extent those interactions affect plant health are poorly understood. We examined root-associated microbial communities from three Arabidopsis thaliana populations and detected mostly negative correlations between bacteria and filamentous microbial eukaryotes. We established microbial culture collections for reconstitution experiments using germ-free A. thaliana. In plants inoculated with mono- or multi-kingdom synthetic microbial consortia, we observed a profound impact of the bacterial root microbiota on fungal and oomycetal community structure and diversity. We demonstrate that the bacterial microbiota is essential for plant survival and protection against root-derived filamentous eukaryotes. Deconvolution of 2,862 binary bacterial-fungal interactions ex situ, combined with community perturbation experiments in planta, indicate that biocontrol activity of bacterial root commensals is a redundant trait that maintains microbial interkingdom balance for plant health.

Abstract: Summary
Acute leukemias are aggressive malignancies of developmentally arrested hematopoietic progenitors. We sought here to explore the possibility that changes in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells during development might alter the biology of leukemias arising from this tissue compartment. Using a mouse model of acute T cell leukemia, we found that leukemias generated from fetal liver (FL) and adult bone marrow (BM) differed dramatically in their leukemia stem cell activity with FL leukemias showing markedly reduced serial transplantability as compared to BM leukemias. We present evidence that this difference is due to NOTCH1-driven autocrine IGF1 signaling, which is active in FL cells but restrained in BM cells by EZH2-dependent H3K27 trimethylation. Further, we confirmed this mechanism is operative in human disease and show that enforced IGF1 signaling effectively limits leukemia stem cell activity. These findings demonstrate that resurrecting dormant fetal programs in adult cells may represent an alternate therapeutic approach in human cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear architecture has never been carefully examined during early mammalian development at the stages leading to establishment of the embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages. Heterogeneous activity of the methyltransferase CARM1 during these stages results in differential methylation of histone H3R26 to modulate establishment of these two lineages. Here we show that CARM1 accumulates in nuclear granules at the 2- to 4-cell stage transition in the mouse embryo, with the majority corresponding to paraspeckles. The paraspeckle component Neat1 and its partner p54nrb are required for CARM1’s association with paraspeckles and for H3R26 methylation. Conversely, CARM1 also influences paraspeckle organization. Depletion of Neat1 or p54nrb results in arrest at the 16- to 32-cell stage, with elevated expression of transcription factor Cdx2, promoting differentiation into the extra-embryonic lineage. This developmental arrest occurs at an earlier stage than following CARM1 depletion, indicating that paraspeckles act upstream of CARM1 but also have additional earlier roles in fate choice.

Abstract: Summary
Unisexual reproduction is widespread among lower vertebrates, but not in mammals. Deletion of the H19 imprinted region in immature oocytes produced bimaternal mice with defective growth; however, bipaternal reproduction has not been previously achieved in mammals. We found that cultured parthenogenetic and androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) display DNA hypomethylation resembling that of primordial germ cells. Through MII oocyte injection or sperm coinjection with hypomethylated haploid ESCs carrying specific imprinted region deletions, we obtained live bimaternal and bipaternal mice. Deletion of 3 imprinted regions in parthenogenetic haploid ESCs restored normal growth of fertile bimaternal mice, whereas deletion of 7 imprinted regions in androgenetic haploid ESCs enabled production of live bipaternal mice that died shortly after birth. Phenotypic analyses of organ and body size of these mice support the genetic conflict theory of genomic imprinting. Taken together, our results highlight the factors necessary for crossing same-sex reproduction barriers in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
How the topography of neural circuits relates to their function remains unclear. Although topographic maps exist for sensory and motor variables, they are rarely observed for cognitive variables. Using calcium imaging during virtual navigation, we investigated the relationship between the anatomical organization and functional properties of grid cells, which represent a cognitive code for location during navigation. We found a substantial degree of grid cell micro-organization in mouse medial entorhinal cortex: grid cells and modules all clustered anatomically. Within a module, the layout of grid cells was a noisy two-dimensional lattice in which the anatomical distribution of grid cells largely matched their spatial tuning phases. This micro-arrangement of phases demonstrates the existence of a topographical map encoding a cognitive variable in rodents. It contributes to a foundation for evaluating circuit models of the grid cell network and is consistent with continuous attractor models as the mechanism of grid formation.

Abstract: Summary
Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, only a minority of patients respond to these immunotherapies. Here, we report that blocking the inhibitory NKG2A receptor enhances tumor immunity by promoting both natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cell effector functions in mice and humans. Monalizumab, a humanized anti-NKG2A antibody, enhanced NK cell activity against various tumor cells and rescued CD8+ T cell function in combination with PD-x axis blockade. Monalizumab also stimulated NK cell activity against antibody-coated target cells. Interim results of a phase II trial of monalizumab plus cetuximab in previously treated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck showed a 31% objective response rate. Most common adverse events were fatigue (17%), pyrexia (13%), and headache (10%). NKG2A targeting with monalizumab is thus a novel checkpoint inhibitory mechanism promoting anti-tumor immunity by enhancing the activity of both T and NK cells, which may complement first-generation immunotherapies against cancer.

Abstract: Summary
IDH1 mutations are common in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas and cause overproduction of (R)-2HG. (R)-2HG modulates the activity of many enzymes, including some that are linked to transformation and some that are probably bystanders. Although prior work on (R)-2HG targets focused on 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, we found that (R)-2HG potently inhibits the 2OG-dependent transaminases BCAT1 and BCAT2, likely as a bystander effect, thereby decreasing glutamate levels and increasing dependence on glutaminase for the biosynthesis of glutamate and one of its products, glutathione. Inhibiting glutaminase specifically sensitized IDH mutant glioma cells to oxidative stress in vitro and to radiation in vitro and in vivo. These findings highlight the complementary roles for BCATs and glutaminase in glutamate biosynthesis, explain the sensitivity of IDH mutant cells to glutaminase inhibitors, and suggest a strategy for maximizing the effectiveness of such inhibitors against IDH mutant gliomas.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are highly heterogeneous tissue-resident immune cells that perform a variety of tissue-supportive functions. The current paradigm dictates that intestinal macrophages are continuously replaced by incoming monocytes that acquire a pro-inflammatory or tissue-protective signature. Here, we identify a self-maintaining population of macrophages that arise from both embryonic precursors and adult bone marrow-derived monocytes and persists throughout adulthood. Gene expression and imaging studies of self-maintaining macrophages revealed distinct transcriptional profiles that reflect their unique localization (i.e., closely positioned to blood vessels, submucosal and myenteric plexus, Paneth cells, and Peyer’s patches). Depletion of self-maintaining macrophages resulted in morphological abnormalities in the submucosal vasculature and loss of enteric neurons, leading to vascular leakage, impaired secretion, and reduced intestinal motility. These results provide critical insights in intestinal macrophage heterogeneity and demonstrate the strategic role of self-maintaining macrophages in gut homeostasis and intestinal physiology.

Abstract: Summary
In early mammalian embryos, it remains unclear how the first cell fate bias is initially triggered and amplified toward cell fate segregation. Here, we report that a long noncoding RNA, LincGET, is transiently and asymmetrically expressed in the nucleus of two- to four-cell mouse embryos. Overexpression of LincGET in one of the two-cell blastomeres biases its progeny predominantly toward the inner cell mass (ICM) fate. Mechanistically, LincGET physically binds to CARM1 and promotes the nuclear localization of CARM1, which can further increase the level of H3 methylation at Arginine 26 (H3R26me), activate ICM-specific gene expression, upregulate transposons, and increase global chromatin accessibility. Simultaneous overexpression of LincGET and depletion of Carm1 no longer biased embryonic fate, indicating that the effect of LincGET in directing ICM lineage depends on CARM1. Thus, our data identify LincGET as one of the earliest known lineage regulators to bias cell fate in mammalian 2-cell embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) entails receptor-mediated delivery of CdiA-derived toxins into Gram-negative target bacteria. Using electron cryotomography, we show that each CdiA effector protein forms a filament extending ∼33 nm from the cell surface. Remarkably, the extracellular filament represents only the N-terminal half of the effector. A programmed secretion arrest sequesters the C-terminal half of CdiA, including the toxin domain, in the periplasm prior to target-cell recognition. Upon binding receptor, CdiA secretion resumes, and the periplasmic FHA-2 domain is transferred to the target-cell outer membrane. The C-terminal toxin region of CdiA then penetrates into the target-cell periplasm, where it is cleaved for subsequent translocation into the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that the FHA-2 domain assembles into a transmembrane conduit for toxin transport into the periplasm of target bacteria. We propose that receptor-triggered secretion ensures that FHA-2 export is closely coordinated with integration into the target-cell outer membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Irisin is secreted by muscle, increases with exercise, and mediates certain favorable effects of physical activity. In particular, irisin has been shown to have beneficial effects in adipose tissues, brain, and bone. However, the skeletal response to exercise is less clear, and the receptor for irisin has not been identified. Here we show that irisin binds to proteins of the αV class of integrins, and biophysical studies identify interacting surfaces between irisin and αV/β5 integrin. Chemical inhibition of the αV integrins blocks signaling and function by irisin in osteocytes and fat cells. Irisin increases both osteocytic survival and production of sclerostin, a local modulator of bone remodeling. Genetic ablation of FNDC5 (or irisin) completely blocks osteocytic osteolysis induced by ovariectomy, preventing bone loss and supporting an important role of irisin in skeletal remodeling. Identification of the irisin receptor should greatly facilitate our understanding of irisin’s function in exercise and human health.

Abstract: Summary
Many disease-causing missense mutations affect intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins, but the molecular mechanism of their pathogenicity is enigmatic. Here, we employ a peptide-based proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1, and CACNA1H) lead to an increased clathrin binding. All three mutations create dileucine motifs known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on GLUT1 (SLC2A1), the glucose transporter causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments. Mutant GLUT1 interacts with adaptor proteins (APs) in vitro, and knocking down AP-2 reverts the cellular mislocalization and restores glucose transport. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in structurally disordered cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins. Thus, several mutations in disordered regions appear to cause “dileucineopathies.”

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between the gut microbiota, diet, and the host potentially contribute to the development of metabolic diseases. Here, we identify imidazole propionate as a microbially produced histidine-derived metabolite that is present at higher concentrations in subjects with versus without type 2 diabetes. We show that imidazole propionate is produced from histidine in a gut simulator at higher concentrations when using fecal microbiota from subjects with versus without type 2 diabetes and that it impairs glucose tolerance when administered to mice. We further show that imidazole propionate impairs insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate through the activation of p38γ MAPK, which promotes p62 phosphorylation and, subsequently, activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We also demonstrate increased activation of p62 and mTORC1 in liver from subjects with type 2 diabetes. Our findings indicate that the microbial metabolite imidazole propionate may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation dynamics at nucleotide resolution using C/EBPα-enhanced reprogramming of B cells into induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). We observed successive waves of hydroxymethylation at enhancers, concomitant with a decrease in DNA methylation, suggesting active demethylation. Consistent with this finding, ablation of the DNA demethylase Tet2 almost completely abolishes reprogramming. C/EBPα, Klf4, and Tfcp2l1 each interact with Tet2 and recruit the enzyme to specific DNA sites. During reprogramming, some of these sites maintain high levels of 5hmC, and enhancers and promoters of key pluripotency factors become demethylated as early as 1 day after Yamanaka factor induction. Surprisingly, methylation changes precede chromatin opening in distinct chromatin regions, including Klf4 bound sites, revealing a pioneer factor activity associated with alteration in DNA methylation. Rapid changes in hydroxymethylation similar to those in B cells were also observed during compound-accelerated reprogramming of fibroblasts into iPSCs, highlighting the generality of our observations.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosylation of proteins can profoundly impact their function and serves as an effective mechanism by which bacterial toxins impair eukaryotic cell processes. Here, we report the discovery that bacteria also employ ADP-ribosylating toxins against each other during interspecies competition. We demonstrate that one such toxin from Serratia proteamaculans interrupts the division of competing cells by modifying the essential bacterial tubulin-like protein, FtsZ, adjacent to its protomer interface, blocking its capacity to polymerize. The structure of the toxin in complex with its immunity determinant revealed two distinct modes of inhibition: active site occlusion and enzymatic removal of ADP-ribose modifications. We show that each is sufficient to support toxin immunity; however, the latter additionally provides unprecedented broad protection against non-cognate ADP-ribosylating effectors. Our findings reveal how an interbacterial arms race has produced a unique solution for safeguarding the integrity of bacterial cell division machinery against inactivating post-translational modifications.

Abstract: Summary
The decline of tissue regenerative potential with age correlates with impaired stem cell function. However, limited strategies are available for therapeutic modulation of stem cell function during aging. Using skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) as a model system, we identify cell death by mitotic catastrophe as a cause of impaired stem cell proliferative expansion in aged animals. The mitotic cell death is caused by a deficiency in Notch activators in the microenvironment. We discover that ligand-dependent stimulation of Notch activates p53 in MuSCs via inhibition of Mdm2 expression through Hey transcription factors during normal muscle regeneration and that this pathway is impaired in aged animals. Pharmacologic activation of p53 promotes the expansion of aged MuSCs in vivo. Altogether, these findings illuminate a Notch-p53 signaling axis that plays an important role in MuSC survival during activation and is dysregulated during aging, contributing to the age-related decline in muscle regenerative potential.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immune factors may restrict hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) genetic engineering and contribute to broad individual variability in gene therapy outcomes. Here, we show that HSCs harbor an early, constitutively active innate immune block to lentiviral transduction that can be efficiently overcome by cyclosporine H (CsH). CsH potently enhances gene transfer and editing in human long-term repopulating HSCs by inhibiting interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), which potently restricts VSV glycoprotein-mediated vector entry. Importantly, individual variability in endogenous IFITM3 levels correlated with permissiveness of HSCs to lentiviral transduction, suggesting that CsH treatment will be useful for improving ex vivo gene therapy and standardizing HSC transduction across patients. Overall, our work unravels the involvement of innate pathogen recognition molecules in immune blocks to gene correction in primary human HSCs and highlights how these roadblocks can be overcome to develop innovative cell and gene therapies.
