Abstract: Consumption of trans fatty acids (TFA) increase cardiovascular risk more than do saturated FA, but the mechanisms explaining their atherogenicity are still unclear. We investigated the impact of membrane incorporation of TFA on cholesterol efflux by exposing J774 mouse macrophages or human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) to media enriched or not (standard medium) with industrially produced elaidic (trans-9 18:1) acid, naturally produced vaccenic (trans-11 18:1) acid (34h, 70μM) or palmitic acid. In J774 macrophages, elaidic and palmitic acid, but not vaccenic acid, reduced ABCA1-mediated efflux by ~23% without affecting aqueous diffusion, SR-BI or ABCG1-mediated pathways, and this effect was maintained in cholesterol-loaded cells. The impact of elaidic acid on the ABCA1 pathway was weaker in cholesterol-normal HMDM, but elaidic acid induced a strong reduction of ABCA1-mediated efflux in cholesterol-loaded cells (−36%). In J774 cells, the FA supplies had no impact on cellular free cholesterol or cholesteryl ester masses, the abundance of ABCA1 mRNA or the total and plasma membrane ABCA1 protein content. Conversely, TFA or palmitic acid incorporation induced strong modifications of the membrane FA composition with a decrease in the ratio of (cis-monounsaturated FA+polyunsaturated FA):(saturated FA+TFA), with elaidic and vaccenic acids representing each 20% and 13% of the total FA composition, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that cellular ATP was required for the effect of elaidic acid, suggesting that it contributes to atherogenesis by impairing ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages, likely by decreasing the membrane fluidity, which could thereby reduce ATPase activity and the function of the transporter.

Abstract: Objectives: The goal of the current study is to determine whether the β-adrenoreceptor (β-AR) plays a role in the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG). Material and methods: This has been investigated in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the human β1-, β2-, β3-AR and in ob/ob mice. Cyclic AMP assays were carried out along with binding studies. Ob/ob mice were treated with ZAG and glucose transportation and insulin were examined in the presence or absence of propranolol. Results: ZAG bound to the β3-AR with higher affinity (Kd 46±1nM) than the β2-AR (Kd 71±3nM) while there was no binding to the β1-AR, and this correlated with the increases in cyclic AMP in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the various β-AR and treated with ZAG. Treatment of ob/ob mice with ZAG increased protein expression of β3-AR in gastrocnemius muscle, and in white and brown adipose tissues, but had no effect on expression of β1- and β2-AR. A reduction of body weight was seen and urinary glucose excretion, increase in body temperature, reduction in maximal plasma glucose and insulin levels in the oral glucose tolerance test, and stimulation of glucose transport into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, were completely attenuated by the non-specific β-AR antagonist propranolol. Conclusion: The results suggest that the effects of ZAG on body weight and insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice are manifested through a β-3AR, or possibly a β2-AR.

Abstract: A previous data showed that the hypoxia mimetic compound CoCl2 induced cleavage of HuR and subsequent apoptosis in human oral cancer cells. We also previously demonstrated that exposure of NT-2 human neuronal precursor cells to hypoxia resulted in changes in sphingolipid levels and apoptosis. Since it is known that CoCl2 induces cleavage of HuR, we investigated whether there is a link between HuR cleavage and the observed sphingolipid changes in cells exposed to hypoxia, and whether this link is associated with the induction of apoptosis. Exposure of hepatocytes to direct hypoxia by means of a hypoxic chamber resulted in acid sphingomyelinase activation and ceramide elevation. The elevation in ceramide levels was associated with activation of caspase 5 and the subsequent cleavage of HuR and apoptotic cell death. These data raise the possibility that acid sphingomyelinase and caspase 5 are each potential targets for treating hypoxia (ischemia)-induced liver injury.

Abstract: Cyclooxygenases (COX) and 8R-dioxygenase (8R-DOX) activities of linoleate diol synthases (LDS) are homologous heme-dependent enzymes that oxygenate fatty acids by a tyrosyl radical-mediated hydrogen abstraction and antarafacial insertion of O2. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 (sLOX-1) contains non-heme iron and oxidizes 18:2n−6 with a large deuterium kinetic isotope effect (D-KIE). The aim of the present work was to obtain further mechanistic insight into the action of these enzymes by using a series of n−6 and n−9 fatty acids and by analysis of D-KIE. COX-1 oxidized C20 and C18 fatty acids in the following order of rates: 20:2n−6>20:1n−6>20:3n−9>20:1n−9 and 18:3n−3≥18:2n−6>18:1n−6. 18:2n−6 and its geometrical isomer (9E,12Z)18:2 were both mainly oxygenated at C-9 by COX-1, but the 9Z,12E isomer was mostly oxygenated at C-13. A cis-configured double bond in the n−6 position therefore seems important for substrate positioning. 8R-DOX oxidized (9Z,12E)18:2 at C-8 in analogy with 18:2n−6, but the 9E,12Z isomer was mainly subject to hydrogen abstraction at C-11 and oxygen insertion at C-9 by 8R-DOX of 5,8-LDS. sLOX-1 and 13R-MnLOX oxidized [11S-2H]18:2n−6 with similar D-KIE (~53), which implies that the catalytic metals did not alter the D-KIE. Oxygenation of 18:2n−6 by COX-1 and COX-2 took place with a D-KIE of 3–5 as probed by incubations of [11,11-2H2]- and [11S-2H]18:2n−6. In contrast, the more energetically demanding hydrogen abstractions of the allylic carbons of 20:1n−6 by COX-1 and 18:1n−9 by 8R-DOX were both accompanied by large D-KIE (>20).

Abstract: Large numbers of monocytes are recruited in the infarcted myocardium. Their cell membranes contain cholesterol-rich microdomains called lipids rafts, which participate in numerous signaling cascades. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effect, pravastatin has several pleiotropic effects and is widely used as secondary prevention treatment after myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pravastatin on the organization of cholesterol within monocyte membrane rafts from patients who had suffered myocardial infarction. Monocytes from healthy donors and acute MI patients were cultured with or without 4μM pravastatin. Lipid rafts were extracted by Lubrol WX, caveolae and flat rafts were separated using a modified sucrose gradient. Cholesterol level and caveolin-1 expression in lipid rafts were determined. In healthy donors, cholesterol was concentrated in flat rafts (63±3 vs 13±1%, p<0.001). While monocytes from MI patients presented similar cholesterol distribution in both caveolae and flat rafts. Cholesterol distribution was higher in flat rafts in healthy donors, compared to MI patients (63±3 vs 41±2%, p<0.001), with less distribution in caveolae (13±1 vs 34±2%, p<0.001). Pravastatin reversed the cholesterol distribution in MI patients cells between flat rafts (41±2 vs 66±3%, p<0.001) and caveolae (34±2 vs 18±1%, p<0.001). In conclusion, MI redistributes cholesterol from flat rafts to caveolae indicating monocyte membrane reorganization. In vitro pravastatin treatment restored basal conditions in MI monocytes, suggesting another effect of statins.

Abstract: The carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane, belongs to the carnitine-dependent system of fatty acid transport into mitochondria, where beta-oxidation occurs. CACT exchanges cytosolic acylcarnitine or free carnitine for carnitine in the mitochondrial matrix. The object of this study was to investigate in rat liver the effect, if any, of diets enriched with saturated fatty acids (beef tallow, BT, the control), n−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (fish oil, FO), n−6 PUFA (safflower oil, SO), and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (olive oil, OO) on the activity and expression of CACT. Translocase exchange rates increased, in parallel with CACT mRNA abundance, upon FO-feeding, whereas OO-dietary treatment induced a decrease in both CACT activity and expression. No changes were observed upon SO-feeding. Nuclear run-on assay revealed that FO-treatment increased the transcriptional rate of CACT mRNA. On the other hand, only in the nuclei of hepatocytes from OO-fed rats splicing of the last intron of CACT pre-mRNA and the rate of formation of the 3′-end were affected. Overall, these findings suggest that compared to the BT‐enriched diet, the SO-enriched diet did not influence CACT activity and expression, whereas FO- and OO-feeding alters CACT activity in an opposite fashion, i.e. modulating its expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, respectively.

Abstract: Primary long-chain fatty alcohols are present in a variety of phyla. In eukaryotes, the production of fatty alcohols is catalyzed by fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR) enzymes that convert fatty acyl-CoAs or acyl-ACPs into fatty alcohols. Here, we report on the biochemical properties of a purified plant FAR, Arabidopsis FAR6 (AtFAR6). In vitro assays show that the enzyme preferentially uses 16 carbon acyl-chains as substrates and produces predominantly fatty alcohols. Free fatty acids and fatty aldehyde intermediates can be released from the enzyme, in particular with suboptimal chain lengths and concentrations of the substrates. Both acyl-CoA and acyl-ACP could serve as substrates. Transient expression experiments in Nicotiana tabacum showed that AtFAR6 is a chloroplast localized FAR. In addition, expression of full length AtFAR6 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves resulted in the production of C16:0-alcohol within this organelle. Finally, a GUS reporter gene fusion with the AtFAR6 promoter showed that the AtFAR6 gene is expressed in various tissues of the plant with a distinct pattern compared to that of other Arabidopsis FARs, suggesting specialized functions in planta.

Abstract: Calcium-independent phospholipase A2 group VIA (iPLA2β) releases docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from phospholipids in vitro. Mutations in the iPLA2β gene, PLA2G6, are associated with dystonia-parkinsonism and infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. To understand the role of iPLA2β in brain, we applied our in vivo kinetic method using radiolabeled DHA in 4 to 5-month-old wild type (iPLA2β+/+) and knockout (iPLA2β−/−) mice, and measured brain DHA kinetics, lipid concentrations, and expression of PLA2, cyclooxygenase (COX), and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. Compared to iPLA2β+/+ mice, iPLA2β−/− mice showed decreased rates of incorporation of unesterified DHA from plasma into brain phospholipids, reduced concentrations of several fatty acids (including DHA) esterified in ethanolamine- and serine-glycerophospholipids, and increased lysophospholipid fatty acid concentrations. DHA turnover in brain phospholipids did not differ between genotypes. In iPLA2β−/− mice, brain levels of iPLA2β mRNA, protein, and activity were decreased, as was the iPLA2γ (Group VIB PLA2) mRNA level, while levels of secretory sPLA2-V mRNA, protein, and activity and cytosolic cPLA2-IVA mRNA were increased. Levels of COX-1 protein were decreased in brain, while COX-2 protein and mRNA were increased. Levels of 5-, 12-, and 15-LOX proteins did not differ significantly between genotypes. Thus, a genetic iPLA2β deficiency in mice is associated with reduced DHA metabolism, profound changes in lipid-metabolizing enzyme expression (demonstrating lack of redundancy) and of phospholipid fatty acid content of brain (particularly of DHA), which may be relevant to neurologic abnormalities in humans with PLA2G6 mutations.

The HDL proteome in acute coronary syndromes shifts to an inflammatory profile,

Abstract: Inflammation is a major factor underlying acute coronary syndromes (ACS). HDL particles may be remodeled, becoming functionally defective, under the inflammatory conditions seen in ACS. Shotgun proteomics was used to monitor changes in the HDL proteome between male age-matched control, stable CAD, and ACS subjects (n=10/group). HDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation and separated by 1D-gel followed by LC–MS/MS. We identified 67 HDL-associated proteins, 20 of which validated recently identified proteins including vitronectin and complement C4B, and 5 of which were novel. Using gene ontology analysis, we found that the HDL-proteome consisted of proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis (~50%), with significant contributions by proteins involved in lipid binding, antioxidant, acute-phase response, immune response, and endopeptidase/protease inhibition. Importantly, levels of apoA-IV were significantly reduced in ACS patients, whereas levels of serum amyloid A (SAA) and complement C3 (C3) were significantly increased (spectral counting; t-test p≤0.05), as confirmed by immunoblot or ELISA. Despite differences in protein composition, ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI mediated cholesterol efflux assays did not indicate that HDL from ACS patients is functionally deficient as compared to controls, when corrected for apoA-I mass. Our results support that the HDL proteome differs between control, CAD and ACS patients. Increased abundance of SAA, C3, and other inflammatory proteins in HDL from ACS patients suggests that HDL reflects a shift to an inflammatory profile which, in turn, might alter the protective effects of HDL on the atherosclerotic plaque.

Abstract: Angiogenesis plays remarkable roles in the development of atherosclerotic rupture plaques. However, its essential mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether inhibitor of DNA binding-1 or inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) promoted angiogenesis when exposed to oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and to determine the molecular mechanism involved. Using aortic ring assay and tube formation assay as a model system, a low concentration of oxLDL was found to induce angiogenic sprouting and capillary lumen formation of endothelial cell. But the Id1 expression was significantly upregulated by oxLDL at low and high concentrations. The Id1 was localised in the nuclei of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the control group and in the high-concentration oxLDL group. Id1 was translocated to the cytoplasm at low oxLDL concentrations. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling at low oxLDL concentration was inhibited by treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B. Protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 promoted nuclear export of Id1, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 reduced the nuclear export of Id1. PI3K inhibition blocked oxLDL-induced angiogenesis. Low concentrations of oxLDL promoted angiogenic sprouting and capillary formation. And this process depends on nuclear export of Id1, which in turn is controlled by the PI3K pathway. This report presents a new link between oxLDL and Id1 localisation, and may provide a new insight into the interactions of ox-LDL and Id1 in the context of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Although triacylglycerol (TAG) stores play a critical role in organisms, mechanisms underlying TAG synthesis are poorly understood in invertebrates. In mammals, the synthesis of glycerolipids, including TAG, diacylglycerol (DAG) and phospholipids (PL), occurs predominantly by the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway in most cell types, except for in enterocytes. In these cells, the monoacylglycerol (MAG) pathway accounts for the majority of glycerolipid production. The insect Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas' disease, exhibits a high capacity to produce glycerolipids in the midgut after a blood meal, providing substrates that are transferred to other organs, such as the fat body, which is specialized in TAG production and storage. In this report, the genes required for TAG synthesis were identified in the R. prolixus genome. The genomic data indicated that TAG is synthesized by the G3P pathway, which is the sole pathway for TAG synthesis in this organism. Furthermore, transcription of both the RpGpat and RpDgat genes were upregulated in a diverse number of organs at moments of highest lipid production. In the midgut and fat body, in vitro synthesis of glycerolipids required G3P, but not MAG, as the initial substrate. These results indicate that the G3P pathway is the only route for TAG synthesis in R. prolixus, and its regulation at the transcriptional level can be a determinant of glycerolipid synthesis and TAG formation in insect organs.

Abstract: HDL is a heterogeneous mixture of lipoprotein particles varying in composition, size, and function. We and others have described a small (7.0nm), minor (0.1% of total apolipoprotein AI) particle containing apolipoprotein AI, AIV and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) in humans the function of which is not entirely known. Circulating GPI-PLD levels are regulated by multiple factors including genetics. To determine if genetic variation in GPLD1 affects circulating GPI-PLD levels, we examined the relationship between 32 SNPS upstream, within, and downstream of GPLD1 and circulating GPI-PLD levels in Caucasians (n=77) and African-Americans (n=99). The genotype distribution among races differed at 13 SNPs. Nine SNPS were associated with circulating GPI-PLD levels in Caucasians but not African-Americans. These results suggest that genetic variation of GPLD1 appears to associate with circulating GPI-PLD levels.

Abstract: Phospholipids are widely used excipients for pharmaceutical formulations, such as for preparing biphasic systems or to solubilize or encapsulate poorly soluble drugs. The present study investigates a new property of this class of substance: its ability to inhibit the efflux transporter Pglycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp is expressed in the intestinal epithelium, thereby significantly impairing the systemic absorption of various pharmaceutically active substances. The phospholipid screening performed in this study involved derivatives with different headgroups and fatty acid residues and a number of experimental parameters. For in vitro studies we carried out transport experiments and calcein accumulation assays in Caco-2- and MDCKII mdr1 and wildtype cell lines. The three compounds which displayed significant P-gp inhibition in both assays and in Caco-2 as well as in MDCKII mdr1, consisted of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and either two saturated fatty acid residues of eight (8:0 PC) or ten carbon atoms (10:0 PC), or of two unsaturated docosahexaeonic acid residues (cis-22:6 PC).Supported by P-gp ATPase activity measurements, 8:0 and 10:0 PC were assumed to function as direct P-gp inhibitors interacting with the transporter probably in their monomeric state, whereas a different, as yet unknown mechanism of action applied for cis-22:6 PC.Because of their proven ability to significantly inhibit P-gp in vitro, these phospholipids shall further be elucidated in vivo, whether they may truly serve to increase the bioavailability of orally applied drugs with a P-gp substrate character.

Abstract: U73122 which was originally identified as a phospholipase C inhibitor represents a potent direct inhibitor of purified 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) with an IC50 value of 30nM. 5-LO catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) into leukotrienes which represent mediators involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions and in host defense reactions against microorganisms. Since the efficient inhibition of the human 5-LO enzyme depended on the thiol reactivity of the maleinimide group of U73122, we used this property to identify cysteine residues in the 5-LO protein that are important for 5-LO inhibition by U73122. We found by MALDI-MS that U73122 covalently binds to cysteine residues 99, 159, 248, 264, 416 and 449. Mutation of Cys416 to serine strongly reduces inhibition of 5-LO by U73122 and the additional mutation of three cysteines close to Cys416 further impairs 5-LO inhibition by the compound. Wash out experiments with U73122 and 5-LO indicated an irreversible binding of U73122. Together, our data suggest that the area around Cys416 which is close to the proposed AA entry channel to the active site is an interesting target for the development of new 5-LO inhibitors.

Abstract: The ruminant trans fatty acid vaccenic acid (tVA) favorably alters markers of inflammation. However, it is not yet clear whether these effects are attributed to its endogenous partial conversion to c9,t11-CLA, which is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. We compared the cytokine reducing potential of tVA to c9,t11-CLA in human T-helper (Th) cells as a main source of cytokine production during inflammation. Secondly, we assessed whether a bioconversion of tVA to c9,t11-CLA via stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) encoded activity takes place in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to relate the outcomes of intracellular cytokine measurement to the degree of conversion. TVA reduced the percentage of both IL-2 and TNF-α expressing Th cells significantly, but to a lesser extent compared to c9,t11-CLA, as determined by flow cytometry after alloreactive stimulation of PBMC. Pre-treatment with the selective PPARγ antagonist T0070907 largely re-established the IL-2 and TNF-α positive Th cell population in both tVA and c9,t11-CLA treated cultures. Interestingly, while the portion of tVA dose-dependently increased within the cellular lipid fraction, the initially marginal amount of c9,t11-CLA remained unaltered. However, SCD mRNA although abundantly expressed in PBMC was not regulated by tVA. Conclusively, these results suggest that the cytokine reducing effect of tVA in human T cells is independent of c9,t11-CLA, since no bioconversion occurred. Moreover, the data provide evidence that tVA mechanistically acts in a manner similar to c9,t11-CLA.

Abstract: Lipoprotein metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS) is based on high-density lipoprotein-like particles that use apoE as their predominant apolipoprotein rather than apoA-I. Although apoA-I is not expressed in astrocytes and microglia, which produce CNS apoE, apoA-I is reported to be expressed in porcine brain capillary endothelial cells and also crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB). These mechanisms allow apoA-I to reach concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are approximately 0.5% of its plasma levels. Recently, apoA-I has been shown to enhance cognitive function and reduce cerebrovascular amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mice, raising questions about the regulation and function of apoA-I in the CNS. Peripheral apoA-I metabolism is highly influenced by ABCA1, but less is known about how ABCA1 regulates CNS apoA-I. We report that ABCA1 deficiency leads to greater retention of apoA-I in the CNS than in the periphery. Additionally, treatment of symptomatic AD mice with GW3965, an LXR agonist that stimulates ABCA1 expression, increases apoA-I more dramatically in the CNS compared to the periphery. Furthermore, GW3965-mediated up-regulation of CNS apoA-I is independent of ABCA1. Our results suggest that apoA-I may be regulated by distinct mechanisms on either side of the BBB and that apoA-I may serve to integrate peripheral and CNS lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Chronic exposure of blood vessels to cardiovascular risk factors such as free fatty acids, LDL-cholesterol, homocysteine and hyperglycemia can give rise to endothelial dysfunction, partially due to decreased synthesis and bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). Many of these same risk factors have been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in endothelial cells. The objective of this study was to examine the mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction mediated by ER stress. ER stress elevated both intracellular and plasma membrane (PM) cholesterols in BAEC by ~3-fold, indicated by epifluorescence and cholesterol oxidase methods. Increases in cholesterol levels inversely correlated with neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (NSMase2) activity, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phospho-activation and NO-production. To confirm that ER stress-induced effects on PM cholesterol were a direct consequence of decreased NSMase2 activity, enzyme expression was either enhanced or knocked down in BAEC. NSMase2 over-expression did not significantly affect cholesterol levels or NO-production, but increased eNOS phosphorylation by ~1.7-fold. Molecular knock down of NSMase2 decreased eNOS phosphorylation and NO-production by 50% and 40%, respectively while increasing PM cholesterol by 1.7-fold and intracellular cholesterol by 2.7-fold. Furthermore, over-expression of NSMase2 in ER-stressed BAEC lowered cholesterol levels to within control levels as well as nearly doubled the NO production, restoring it to ~74% and 68% of controls using tunicamycin and palmitate, respectively. This study establishes NSMase2 as a pivotal enzyme in the onset of endothelial ER stress-mediated vascular dysfunction as its inactivation leads to the attenuation of NO production and the elevation of cellular cholesterol.

Abstract: ABCA1 belongs to the A class of ABC transporter, which is absent in yeast. ABCA1 elicits lipid translocation at the plasma membrane through yet elusive processes. We successfully expressed the mouse Abca1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cloned ABCA1 distributed at the yeast plasma membrane in stable discrete domains that we name MCA (membrane cluster containing ABCA1) and that do not overlap with the previously identified punctate structures MCC (membrane cluster containing Can1p) and MCP (membrane cluster containing Pma1p). By comparison with a nonfunctional mutant, we demonstrated that ABCA1 elicits specific phenotypes in response to compounds known to interact with membrane lipids, such as papuamide B, amphotericin B and pimaricin. The sensitivity of these novel phenotypes to the genetic modification of the membrane lipid composition was studied by the introduction of the cho1 and lcb1-100 mutations involved respectively in phosphatidylserine or sphingolipid biosynthesis in yeast cells. The results, corroborated by the analysis of equivalent mammalian mutant cell lines, demonstrate that membrane composition, in particular its phosphatidylserine content, influences the function of the transporter. We thus have reconstituted in yeast the essential functions associated to the expression of ABCA1 in mammals and characterized new physiological phenotypes prone to genetic analysis.

Abstract: Sterculic acid is a cyclopropene fatty acid with numerous biological activities. In this study we demonstrate that sterculic acid is a potent inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and related inflammation caused by 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh). 7KCh is a highly toxic oxysterol suspected in the pathogenesis of various age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration. Sterculic acid demonstrated to be 5–10 times more effective than other anti-inflammatory fatty acids at inhibiting 7KCh-mediated inflammatory responses in cultured cells. In vivo, sterculic acid was effective at inhibiting the formation of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the laser-injury rat model. Our data suggests that sterculic acid may be useful in treating CNV in certain forms of age-related macular degeneration.

Abstract: Helical apolipoproteins remove cellular phospholipid and cholesterol to generate nascent HDL and this reaction is the major source of plasma HDL. ABCA1 is mandatory and rate-limiting for this reaction. Besides regulation of the gene expression by transcriptional factors including LXR, AP2 and SREBP, the ABCA1 activity is regulated post-translationally by calpain-mediated proteolytic degradation of ABCA1 protein that occurs in the early endosome after its endocytosis. When the HDL biogenesis reaction is ongoing as helical apolipoproteins interact with ABCA1, ABCA1 becomes resistant to calpain and is recycled to cell surface after endocytosis. Biogenesis of HDL is most likely to take place on cell surface. Clearance rate of ABCA1 by this mechanism is also retarded by various factors that interact with ABCA1, such as α1-syntrophin, LXRβ and calmodulin. Physiological relevance of the retardation by these factors is not entirely clear. Pharmacological inhibition of the calpain-mediated ABCA1 degradation results in the increase of the ABCA1 activity and HDL biogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and potentially suppresses atherogenesis.

Abstract: Using mass spectrometry (MS), we examined the impact of endothelial lipase (EL) overexpression on the cellular phospholipid (PL) and triglyceride (TG) content of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and of mouse plasma and liver tissue. In HAEC incubated with the major EL substrate, HDL, adenovirus (Ad)-mediated EL overexpression resulted in the generation of various lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) species in cell culture supernatants. While the cellular phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content remained unaltered, cellular phosphatidylcholine (PC)-, LPC- and TG-contents were significantly increased upon EL overexpression. Importantly, cellular lipid composition was not altered when EL was overexpressed in the absence of HDL. [14C]-LPC accumulated in EL overexpressing, but not LacZ-control cells, incubated with [14C]-PC labeled HDL, indicating EL-mediated LPC supply. Exogenously added [14C]-LPC accumulated in HAEC as well. Its conversion to [14C]-PC was sensitive to a lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) inhibitor, thimerosal. Incorporation of [3H]-Choline into cellular PC was 56% lower in EL compared with LacZ cells, indicating decreased endogenous PC synthesis. In mice, adenovirus mediated EL overexpression decreased plasma PC, PE and LPC and increased liver LPC, LPE and TG content. Based on our results, we conclude that EL not only supplies cells with FFA as found previously, but also with HDL-derived LPC and LPE species resulting in increased cellular TG and PC content as well as decreased endogenous PC synthesis.

Abstract: N-Acylethanolamines (NAE) are endogenously produced lipids playing important roles in a diverse range of physiological and pathological conditions. In the present study, using whole-cell patch clamp technique, we have for the first time investigated the effects of the most abundantly produced NAEs, N-stearoylethanolamine (SEA) and N‐oleoylethanolamine (OEA), on electric excitability and membrane currents in cardiomyocytes isolated from endocardial, epicardial, and atrial regions of neonatal rat heart. SEA and OEA (1–10μM) attenuated electrical activity of the myocytes from all regions of the cardiac muscle by hyperpolarizing resting potential, reducing amplitude, and shortening the duration of the action potential. However, the magnitudes of these effects varied significantly depending on the type of cardiac myocyte (i.e., endocardial, epicardial, atrial) with OEA being generally more potent. OEA and to a lesser extent SEA suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner currents through voltage-gated Na+ (VGSC) and L-type Ca2+ (VGCC) channels, but induced variable cardiac myocyte type-dependent effects on background K+ and Cl− conductance. The mechanisms of inhibitory action of OEA on cardiac VGSCs and VGCCs involved influence on channels' activation/inactivation gating and partial blockade of ion permeation. OEA also enhanced the viability of cardiac myocytes by reducing necrosis without a significant effect on apoptosis. We conclude that SEA and OEA attenuate the excitability of cardiac myocytes mainly through inhibition of VGSCs and VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry. Since NAEs are known to increase during tissue ischemia and infarction, these effects of NAEs may mediate some of their cardioprotective actions during these pathological conditions.

Abstract: Monoacylglycerol lipases (MGLs) catalyse the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol into free fatty acid and glycerol. MGLs have been identified throughout all genera of life and have adopted different substrate specificities depending on their physiological role. In humans, MGL plays an integral part in lipid metabolism affecting energy homeostasis, signalling processes and cancer cell progression. In bacteria, MGLs degrade short-chain monoacylglycerols which are otherwise toxic to the organism. We report the crystal structures of MGL from the bacterium Bacillus sp. H257 (bMGL) in its free form at 1.2Å and in complex with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1.8Å resolution. In both structures, bMGL adopts an α/β hydrolase fold with a cap in an open conformation. Access to the active site residues, which were unambiguously identified from the protein structure, is facilitated by two different channels. The larger channel constitutes the highly hydrophobic substrate binding pocket with enough room to accommodate monoacylglycerol. The other channel is rather small and resembles the proposed glycerol exit hole in human MGL. Molecular dynamics simulation of bMGL yielded open and closed states of the entrance channel and the glycerol exit hole. Despite differences in the number of residues, secondary structure elements, and low sequence identity in the cap region, this first structure of a bacterial MGL reveals striking structural conservation of the overall cap architecture in comparison with human MGL. Thus it provides insight into the structural conservation of the cap amongst MGLs throughout evolution and provides a framework for rationalising substrate specificities in each organism.

Abstract: Cells metabolize arachidonic acid (AA) to adrenic acid (AdA) via 2-carbon elongation reactions. Like AA, AdA can be converted into multiple oxygenated metabolites, with important roles in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, in contrast to AA, there is virtually no information on how the cells regulate the availability of free AdA for conversion into bioactive products. We have used a comparative lipidomic approach with both gas chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to characterize changes in the levels of AA- and AdA-containing phospholipid species in RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells. Incubation of the cells with AA results in an extensive conversion to AdA but both fatty acids do not compete with each other for esterification into phospholipids. AdA but not AA, shows preference for incorporation into phospholipids containing stearic acid at the sn-1 position. After stimulation of the cells with zymosan, both AA and AdA are released in large quantities, albeit AA is released to a greater extent. Finally, a variety of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol molecular species contribute to AA; however, AdA is liberated exclusively from phosphatidylcholine species. Collectively, these results identify significant differences in the cellular utilization of AA and AdA by the macrophages, suggesting non-redundant biological actions for these two fatty acids.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1) plays a pivotal role in cholesterol homeostasis by generating high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a lipid acceptor for ABCA1, reportedly interacts with ABCA1. However, it has also been proposed that apoA-I interacts with ABCA1-generated special domains on the plasma membrane, but apart from ABCA1, and solubilizes membrane lipids. To determine the importance of the apoA-I–ABCA1 interaction in HDL formation, the electrostatic interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1, which mediates the interaction between apoB100 in low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL) and LDL receptor, was analyzed. The apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and the cross-linking between them were inhibited by the highly charged molecules heparin and poly-L-lysine. Treating cells with membrane impermeable reagents that specifically react with primary amino groups abolished the interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1. However, these reagents did not affect the characteristic tight ATP binding to ABCA1. These results suggest that lysine residues in the extracellular domains of ABCA1 contribute to the interaction with apoA-I. The electrostatic interaction between ABCA1 and apoA-I is predicted to be the first step in HDL formation.

Abstract: 9-Hydroxystearic acid (9-HSA) belongs to the endogenous lipid peroxidation by-products that decrease in tumors, causing as a consequence the loss of one of the control mechanisms on cell division. It acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC, E.C 3.5.1.98) inhibitor, and the interaction of the two enantiomers of 9-HSA with the catalytic site of the enzyme, investigated by using a molecular modelling approach, has been reported to be different. In this work we tested out this prediction by synthesizing the two enantiomers (R)-9-HSA (R-9) and (S)-9-HSA (S-9) starting from the natural source methyl dimorphecolate obtained from Dimorphotheca sinuata seeds and investigating their biological activity in HT29 cells. Both enantiomers inhibit the enzymatic activity of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3, R-9 being more active; R-9 and S-9 inhibitory effect induces an increase in histone H4 acetylation. We also demonstrate that the antiproliferative effect brought about by R-9 is more pronounced as well as we observe increase of p21 transcription and protein content, while the expression of cyclin D1 is decreased. Starting from these observations it can be hypothesized that the interaction of R-9 with HDAC1 induce conformational changes in the enzyme causing loss of its interaction with other proteins, like cyclin D1 itself.

Abstract: Minimally modified low-density lipoprotein (mm-LDL) induces intimal foam cell formation, which is promoted by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), a cross-point to link cellular processes with multiple risk factors that exist in all stages of atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear whether mm-LDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophages involves ERS and its underlying mechanisms. We showed that mm-LDL induced the accumulation of lipid droplets in RAW264.7 macrophages with increased free cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum, which was markedly attenuated by pretreatment with an antibody against toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Additionally, mm-LDL stimulated the transport of Cy3-labeled activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key sensor to the unfolded protein response (UPR), from cytoplasm into nucleus. The expression of phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (p-IRE1), another sensor to the UPR, and its two downstream molecules, X box binding protein 1 and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), were significantly upregulated by mm-LDL. The alterations induced by mm-LDL were all significantly inhibited by antibodies against TLR4 or CD36. In addition, the upregulation of p-IRE1 and GRP78 and the nuclear translocation of ATF6 induced by mm-LDL were significantly attenuated by TLR4 siRNA. These results suggest that mm-LDL may induce free cholesterol accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently stimulate ERS and activate the UPR signaling pathway mediated by ATF6 and IRE1 in macrophages, a process that is potentially mediated by TLR4.

Abstract: The association between apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) may significantly impact the function of both proteins, thus affecting the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, apoE/Aβ interactions remain fundamentally defined by the stringency of the detection method. Here we use size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as a non-stringent approach to the detection of apoE/Aβ interactions in solution, specifically apoE and both endogenous and exogenous Aβ from plasma, CSF and astrocyte conditioned media. By SEC analysis, Aβ association with plasma and CNS lipoproteins is apoE-dependent. While endogenous Aβ elutes to specific human plasma lipoproteins distinct from those containing apoE, it is the apoE-containing lipoproteins that absorb excess amounts of exogenous Aβ40. In human CSF, apoE, endogenous Aβ and phospholipid elute in an almost identical profile, as do apoE, exogenous Aβ and phospholipid from astrocyte conditioned media. Combining SEC fractionation with subsequent analysis for SDS-stable apoE/Aβ complex reveals that apoE-containing astrocyte lipoproteins exhibit the most robust interactions with Aβ. Thus, standardization of the methods for detecting apoE/Aβ complex is necessary to determine its functional significance in the neuropathology characteristic of AD. Importantly, a systematic understanding of the role of apoE-containing plasma and CNS lipoproteins in Aβ homeostasis could potentially contribute to identifying a plasma biomarker currently over-looked because it has multiple components.

Abstract: We previously described enrichment of conditional Escherichia coli msbA mutants defective in lipopolysaccharide export using Ludox density gradients (Doerrler WT (2007) Appl Environ Microbiol 73; 7992–7996). Here, we use this approach to isolate and characterize temperature-sensitive lpxL mutants. LpxL is a late acyltransferase of the pathway of lipid A biosynthesis (The Raetz Pathway). Sequencing the lpxL gene from the mutants revealed the presence of both missense and nonsense mutations. The missense mutations include several in close proximity to the enzyme's active site or conserved residues (E137K, H132Y, G168D). These data demonstrate that Ludox gradients can be used to efficiently isolate conditional E. coli mutants with defects in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and provide insight into the enzymatic mechanism of LpxL.

Abstract: Sphingolipids, major lipid components of the eukaryotic plasma membrane, have a variety of physiological functions and have been associated with many diseases. They have also been implicated in apoptosis. Sphingolipids are heterogeneous in their acyl chain length, with long-chain (C16) and very long-chain (C24) sphingolipids being predominant in most mammalian tissues. We demonstrate that knockdown of ELOVL1 or CERS2, which catalyze synthesis of C24 acyl-CoAs and C24 ceramide, respectively, drastically reduced C24 sphingolipid levels with a complementary increase in C16 sphingolipids. Under ELOVL1 or CERS2 knockdown conditions, cisplatin-induced apoptosis significantly increased. Enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis exhibited close correlation with increases in caspase-3/7 activity. No significant alterations in sphingolipid metabolism such as ceramide generation were apparent with the cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and inhibitors of ceramide generation had no effect on the apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by UV radiation or C6 ceramides also increased in ELOVL1 or CERS2 knockdown cells. Changes in the composition of sphingolipid chain length may affect susceptibility to stimuli-induced apoptosis by affecting the properties of cell membranes, such as lipid microdomain/raft formation.

Abstract: Development of insulin resistance is positively associated with dietary saturated fatty acids and negatively associated with monounsaturated fatty acids. To clarify aspects of this difference we have compared the metabolism of oleic (OA, monounsaturated) and palmitic acids (PA, saturated) in human myotubes. Human myotubes were treated with 100μM OA or PA and the metabolism of [14C]-labeled fatty acid was studied. We observed that PA had a lower lipolysis rate than OA, despite a more than two-fold higher protein level of adipose triglyceride lipase after 24h incubation with PA. PA was less incorporated into triacylglycerol and more incorporated into phospholipids after 24h. Supporting this, incubation with compounds modifying lipolysis and reesterification pathways suggested a less influenced PA than OA metabolism. In addition, PA showed a lower accumulation than OA, though PA was oxidized to a relatively higher extent than OA. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that 24h of PA treatment upregulated lipogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation and downregulated oxidative phosphorylation compared to OA. The differences in lipid accumulation and lipolysis between OA and PA were eliminated in combination with eicosapentaenoic acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid). In conclusion, this study reveals that the two most abundant fatty acids in our diet are partitioned toward different metabolic pathways in muscle cells, and this may be relevant to understand the link between dietary fat and skeletal muscle insulin resistance.

Abstract: Though most of the studies have focused on the effects of free fatty acids on T-cell activation, fatty acids incorporated into plasma membrane phospholipids may also affect cell signaling via diacylglycerol (DAG), generally produced by phospholipid hydrolysis. In the present study, we have synthesized a DAG-containing oleic acid and studied its implication in the modulation of calcium signaling in human Jurkat T-cells. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol (POG) induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i. This effect was due to the presence of oleic acid at the sn-2 position as no differences were observed between POG and 1-stearoly-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol (SOG). However, the substitution of oleic acid with arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position of the DAG moiety exerted a different response on the increases in [Ca2+]i in these cells. POG-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i were not due to its metabolites. Furthermore, POG-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were due to the opening of TRPC3/TRPC6 channels as silencing of TRPC3 and TRPC6 genes by shRNA abolished calcium entry. Moreover, disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-β-cyclodextrin completely abolished POG-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that oleic acid can influence T-lymphocyte functions, in the conjugated form of DAG, via opening TRPC3/6 channels.

Abstract: Alterations in lipid metabolism and in the lipid composition of cellular membranes are linked to the pathology of numerous diseases including cancer. However, the influence of oncogene expression on cellular lipid profile is currently unknown. In this work we analyzed changes in lipid profiles that are induced in the course of ERBB2-expression mediated premature senescence. As a model system we used MCF-7 breast cancer cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of NeuT, an oncogenic ERBB2 variant. Affymetrix gene array data showed NeuT-induced alterations in the transcription of many enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, several of which (ACSL3, CHPT1, PLD1, LIPG, MGLL, LDL and NPC1) could be confirmed by quantitative realtime PCR. A study of the glycerophospholipid and lyso-glycerophospholipid profiles, obtained by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry revealed senescence-associated changes in numerous lipid species, including mitochondrial lipids. The most prominent changes were found in PG(34:1), PG(36:1) (increased) and LPE(18:1), PG(40:7) and PI(36:1) (decreased). Statistical analysis revealed a general trend towards shortened phospholipid acyl chains in senescence and a significant trend to more saturated acyl chains in the class of phosphatidylglycerol. Additionally, the cellular cholesterol content was elevated and accumulated in vacuoles in senescent cells. These changes were accompanied by increased membrane fluidity. In mitochondria, loss of membrane potential along with altered intracellular distribution was observed. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive overview of altered cholesterol and glycerophospholipid patterns in senescence, showing that predominantly mitochondrial lipids are affected and lipid species less susceptible to peroxidation are increased.

Abstract: Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a recessive disease characterized by markedly elevated levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and reduced levels of cholesterol in tissues and fluids of affected individuals, due to defective 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ7-reductase (Dhcr7). Treatment of Sprague Dawley rats with AY9944 (an inhibitor of Dhcr7) leads to similar biochemical features as observed in SLOS. Eighteen oxysterols previously have been identified as oxidation products of 7-DHC (most of them distinct from cholesterol (Chol)-derived oxysterols) in solution, in cells, and in brains obtained from Dhcr7-KO mice and AY9944-treated rats, formed either via free radical oxidation (peroxidation) or P450-catalyzed enzymatic oxidation. We report here the identification of five 7-DHC-derived oxysterols, including 3β,5α-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), 4α- and 4β-hydroxy-7-DHC, 24-hydroxy-7-DHC and 7-ketocholesterol (7-kChol, an oxysterol that is normally derived from Chol), in the retinas of AY9944-treated rats by comparing the retention times and mass spectrometric characteristics with corresponding synthetic standards in HPLC-MS analysis. Levels of 4α- and 4β-hydroxy-7-DHC, DHCEO, and 7-kChol were quantified using d7-DHCEO as an internal standard. Among the five oxysterols identified, only 7-kChol was observed in retinas of control rats, but the levels of 7-kChol in retinas of AY9944-rats were 30-fold higher. Intravitreal injection of 7-kChol (0.25μmol) into a normal rat eye induced panretinal degeneration within one week; by comparison, contralateral (control) eyes injected with vehicle alone exhibited normal histology. These findings are discussed in the context of the potential involvement of 7-DHC-derived oxysterols in the retinal degeneration associated with the SLOS rat model and in SLOS patients.

Abstract: Minimally modified low density lipoprotein (mmLDL) is a well-known risk factor for coronary artery disease. Upregulation of vascular endothelin type B (ETB) receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells is predicted to be the molecular mechanism that leads to cardiovascular pathogenesis. The objective of the present study was to examine the hypothesis that mmLDL upregulates ETB receptors in rat coronary artery. The contractile responses to sarafotoxin 6c (ETB receptor agonist) were studied using a sensitive myograph. ETB receptor mRNA and protein expression was determined using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The results showed that organ culture increased the contractile responses induced by sarafotoxin 6c and the levels of ETB receptor mRNA and protein. This increase was further enhanced by the addition of mmLDL (10μg/mL). Specific ERK1/2 inhibitors (SB386023 and U0126) and an NF-κB inhibitor (wedelolactone) attenuated the mmLDL-increased ETB receptor-mediated contraction and ETB receptor mRNA and protein levels. Wedelolactone significantly attenuated the mmLDL-decreased IκBα protein expression. Consistent with this result, IκBα protein expression was significantly decreased by culture with mmLDL compared to the level of expression in the organ culture group. However, the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 or p38 pathway inhibitor, SB203580 did not inhibit mmLDL-enhanced effects. The PKC inhibitor, staurosporine attenuated only culture-alone-increased effects. In conclusion, mmLDL upregulates the ETB receptors in rat coronary arterial smooth muscle cells, mainly via activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK and the downstream transcriptional factor NF-κB.

Abstract: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in eukaryotes and is estimated to be present in about 15% of eubacteria. It can be synthesized in bacteria by either of two pathways, the phospholipid N-methylation pathway or the phosphatidylcholine synthase (Pcs) pathway. Pcs belongs to the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase superfamily and synthesizes PC and CMP in one step from CDP-diacylglycerol and choline. In this study, we aligned sequences of characterized Pcs enzymes to identify conserved amino acid residues. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed on 55 of these conserved residues. The mutation of nine residues caused a drastic to complete loss (<20% of wild type activity) of Pcs activity. Six of these essential residues were subjected to further mutagenesis studies replacing them by amino acids with similar properties or size. A topological analysis of sinorhizobial Pcs showed the presence of eight transmembrane helices, with the C- and N-terminus located in the cytoplasm. The majority of the conserved residues is predicted to be either located within the cytoplasmic loops or on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane which can be expected for an enzyme using one membrane-associated and one soluble substrate.

Abstract: Human synovial fluid (SF) provides nutrition and lubrication to the articular cartilage. Particularly in arthritic diseases, SF is extensively accumulating in the synovial junction. During the last decade lipids have attracted considerable attention as their role in the development and resolution of diseases became increasingly recognized. Here, we describe a capillary LC–MS/MS screening platform that was used for the untargeted screening of lipids present in human SF of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Using this platform we give a detailed overview of the lipids and lipid‐derived mediators present in the SF of RA patients. Almost 70 different lipid components from distinct lipid classes were identified and quantification was achieved for the lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine species. In addition, we describe a targeted LC–MS/MS lipid mediator metabolomics strategy for the detection, identification and quantification of maresin 1, lipoxin A4 and resolvin D5 in SF from RA patients. Additionally, we present the identification of 5S,12S-diHETE as a major marker of lipoxygenase pathway interactions in the investigated SF samples. These results are the first to provide a comprehensive approach to the identification and profiling of lipids and lipid mediators present in SF and to describe the presence of key anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators identified in SF from RA patients.

Abstract: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to use some fatty acids, such as oleic acid, as a sole source of carbon. β-oxidation, which occurs in a single membrane-enveloped organelle or peroxisome, is responsible for the assimilation of fatty acids. In S. cerevisiae, β-oxidation occurs only in peroxisomes, and H2O2 is generated during this fatty acid-metabolizing pathway. S. cerevisiae has three GPX genes (GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3) encoding atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins. Here we show that expression of GPX1 was induced in medium containing oleic acid as a carbon source in an Msn2/Msn4-dependent manner. We found that Gpx1 was located in the peroxisomal matrix. The peroxisomal Gpx1 showed peroxidase activity using thioredoxin or glutathione as a reducing power. Peroxisome biogenesis was induced when cells were cultured with oleic acid. Peroxisome biogenesis was impaired in gpx1∆ cells, and subsequently, the growth of gpx1∆ cells was lowered in oleic acid-containing medium. Gpx1 contains six cysteine residues. Of the cysteine-substituted mutants of Gpx1, Gpx1C36S was not able to restore growth and peroxisome formation in oleic acid-containing medium, therefore, redox regulation of Gpx1 seems to be involved in the mechanism of peroxisome formation.

Abstract: DNA damaging agents typically induce an apoptotic cascade in which p53 plays a central role. However, absence of a p53-mediated response does not necessarily abrogate programmed cell death, due to the existence of p53-independent apoptotic pathways, such as those mediated by the pro-apoptotic molecule ceramide. We compared ceramide levels before and after DNA damage in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) and colon cancer (HCT116) cells that were either expressing or deficient in p53. When treated with mitomycin C, p53-deficient cells, but not p53-expressing cells, showed a marked increase in ceramide levels. Microarray analysis of genes involved in ceramide metabolism identified acid ceramidase (ASAH1, up-regulated), ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG, down-regulated), and galactosylceramidase (GALC, up-regulated) as the three genes most affected. Experiments employing pharmacological and siRNA agents revealed that inhibition of UGCG is sufficient to increase ceramide levels and induce cell death. When inhibition of UGCG and treatment with mitomycin C were combined, p53-deficient, but not p53-expressing cells, showed a significant increase in cell death, suggesting that the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism could be used to sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Abstract: Cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) up-regulation has been reported in human colorectal cancer cells, thus we aimed to elucidate its role in the proliferation of the human colorectal cancer cell line, HT-29. EGF caused a rapid activation of cPLA2α which coincided with a significant increase in cell proliferation. The inhibition of cPLA2α activity by pyrrophenone or by antisense oligonucleotide against cPLA2α (AS) or inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by indomethacin resulted with inhibition of cell proliferation, that was restored by addition of PGE2. The secreted PGE2 activated both protein kinase A (PKA) and PKB/Akt pathways via the EP2 and EP4 receptors. Either, the PKA inhibitor (H-89) or the PKB/Akt inhibitor (Ly294002) caused a partial inhibition of cell proliferation which was restored by PGE2. But, inhibited proliferation in the presence of both inhibitors could not be restored by addition of PGE2. AS or H-89, but not Ly294002, inhibited CREB activation, suggesting that CREB activation is mediated by PKA. AS or Ly294002, but not H-89, decreased PKB/Akt activation as well as the nuclear localization of β-catenin and cyclin D1 and increased the plasma membrane localization of β-catenin with E-cadherin, suggesting that these processes are regulated by the PKB pathway. Similarly, Caco-2 cells exhibited cPLA2α dependent proliferation via activation of both PKA and PKB/Akt pathways. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the regulation of HT-29 proliferation is mediated by cPLA2α-dependent PGE2 production. PGE2 via EP induces CREB phosphorylation by the PKA pathway and regulates β-catenin and cyclin D1 cellular localization by PKB/Akt pathway.

Abstract: Ceramide, a biologically active sphingolipid in cell death signaling, accumulates upon CD95L treatment, concomitantly to apoptosis induction in Jurkat leukemia T cells. Herein, we show that ceramide did not increase in caspase-8 and -10-doubly deficient Jurkat cells in response to CD95L, indicating that apical caspases are essential for CD95L-triggered ceramide formation. Jurkat cells are typically defined as type 2 cells, which require the activation of the mitochondrial pathway for efficient apoptosis induction in response to CD95L. Caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells significantly resisted CD95L-induced apoptosis, despite ceramide accumulation. Knock-down of sphingomyelin synthase 1, which metabolizes ceramide to sphingomyelin, enhanced (i) CD95L-triggered ceramide production, (ii) cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and (iii) caspase-9 activation. Exogenous ceramide-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were impaired in caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells. Conversely, caspase-9 re-expression in caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells restored caspase-3 activation and apoptosis upon exogenous ceramide treatment. Collectively, our data provide genetic evidence that CD95L-triggered endogenous ceramide increase in Jurkat leukemia T cells (i) is not a mere consequence of cell death and occurs mainly in a caspase-9-independent manner, (ii) is likely involved in the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial pathway leading to caspase-9 activation.

Abstract: Docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-6, 22:5n-6) is an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) whose brain concentration can be increased in rodents by dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency, which may contribute to their behavioral dysfunction. We used our in vivo intravenous infusion method to see if brain DPAn-6 turnover and metabolism also were altered with deprivation. We studied male rats that had been fed for 15weeks post-weaning an n-3 PUFA adequate diet containing 4.6% alpha-linolenic acid (α-LNA, 18:3n-3) or a deficient diet (0.2% α-LNA), each lacking docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6). [1-14C]DPAn-6 was infused intravenously for 5min in unanesthetized rats, after which the brain underwent high-energy microwaving, and then was analyzed. The n-3 PUFA deficient compared with adequate diet increased DPAn-6 and decreased DHA concentrations in plasma and brain, while minimally changing brain AA concentration. Incorporation rates of unesterified DPAn-6 from plasma into individual brain phospholipids were increased 5.2–7.7 fold, while turnover rates were increased 2.1–4.7 fold. The observations suggest that increased metabolism and brain concentrations of DPAn-6 and its metabolites, together with a reduced brain DHA concentration, contribute to behavioral and functional abnormalities reported with dietary n-3 PUFA deprivation in rodents.

Abstract: The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is associated with several co-morbid conditions including diabetes, dyslipidemia, cancer, atherosclerosis and gallstones. Obesity is associated with low systemic inflammation and an accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) that are thought to modulate insulin resistance. ATMs may also modulate adipocyte metabolism and take up lipids released during adipocyte lipolysis and cell death. We suggest that high levels of free cholesterol residing in adipocytes are released during these processes and contribute to ATM activation and accumulation during obesity and caloric restriction. Db/db mice were studied for extent of adipose tissue inflammation under feeding conditions of ad libitum (AL) and caloric restriction (CR). The major finding was a marked elevation in epididymal adipose ABCG1 mRNA levels with obesity and CR (6-fold and 16-fold, respectively) over that seen for lean wild-type mice. ABCG1 protein was also elevated for CR as compared to AL adipose tissue. ABCG1 is likely produced by cholesterol loaded ATMs since this gene is not highly expressed in adipocytes and ABCG1 expression is sterol mediated. Our data supports the concept that metabolic changes in adipocytes due to demand lipolysis and cell death lead to cholesterol loading of ATMs. Based on finding cholesterol-loaded peritoneal leukocytes with elevated levels of ABCG1 in CR as compared to AL mice, we suggest that pathways for cholesterol trafficking out of adipose tissue involve ATM egress as well as ABCG1 mediated cholesterol efflux.

Abstract: We report a systems genetic analysis of high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in an F2 intercross between inbred strains CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J. We previously showed that there are dramatic differences in HDL metabolism in a cross between these strains, and we now report co-expression network analysis of HDL that integrates global expression data from liver and adipose with relevant metabolic traits. Using data from a total of 293 F2 intercross mice, we constructed weighted gene co-expression networks and identified modules (subnetworks) associated with HDL and clinical traits. These were examined for genes implicated in HDL levels based on large human genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) and examined with respect to conservation between tissue and sexes in a total of 9 data sets. We identify genes that are consistently ranked high by association with HDL across the 9 data sets. We focus in particular on two genes, Wfdc2 and Hdac3, that are located in close proximity to HDL QTL peaks where causal testing indicates that they may affect HDL. Our results provide a rich resource for studies of complex metabolic interactions involving HDL.

Diacylglycerol stimulates acrosomal exocytosis by feeding into a PKC- and PLD1-dependent positive loop that continuously supplies phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate,

Abstract: Acrosomal exocytosis involves a massive fusion between the outer acrosomal and the plasma membranes of the spermatozoon triggered by stimuli that open calcium channels at the plasma membrane. Diacylglycerol has been implicated in the activation of these calcium channels. Here we report that this lipid promotes the efflux of intraacrosomal calcium and triggers exocytosis in permeabilized human sperm, implying that diacylglycerol activates events downstream of the opening of plasma membrane channels. Furthermore, we show that calcium and diacylglycerol converge in a signaling pathway leading to the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Addition of diacylglycerol promotes the PKC-dependent activation of PLD1. Rescue experiments adding phosphatidic acid or PIP2 and direct measurement of lipid production suggest that both PKC and PLD1 promote PIP2 synthesis. Inhibition of different steps of the pathway was reverted by adenophostin, an agonist of IP3-sensitive calcium channels, indicating that PIP2 is necessary to keep these channels opened. However, phosphatidic acid, PIP2, or adenophostin could not trigger exocytosis by themselves, indicating that diacylglycerol must also activate another factor. We found that diacylglycerol and phorbol ester stimulate the accumulation of the GTP-bound form of Rab3A. Together our results indicate that diacylglycerol promotes acrosomal exocytosis by i) maintaining high levels of IP3 – an effect that depends on a positive feedback loop leading to the production of PIP2 – and ii) stimulating the activation of Rab3A, which in turn initiates a cascade of protein interactions leading to the assembly of SNARE complexes and membrane fusion.

Dysfunctional HDL containing L159R ApoA-I leads to exacerbation of atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice,

Abstract: The mutation L159R apoA-I or apoA-IL159R (FIN) is a single amino acid substitution within the sixth helical repeat of apoA-I. It is associated with a dominant negative phenotype, displaying hypoalphaproteinemia and an increased risk for atherosclerosis in humans. Mice lacking both mouse apoA-I and LDL receptor (LDL−/−, apoA-I−/−) (double knockout or DKO) were crossed>9 generations with mice transgenic for human FIN to obtain L159R apoA-I, LDLr−/−, ApoA-I−/− (FIN-DKO) mice. A similar cross was also performed with human wild-type (WT) apoA-I (WT-DKO). In addition, FIN-DKO and WT-DKO were crossed to obtain WT/FIN-DKO mice. To determine the effects of the apoA-I mutations on atherosclerosis, groups of each genotype were fed either chow or an atherogenic diet for 12weeks. Interestingly, the production of dysfunctional HDL-like particles occurred in DKO and FIN-DKO mice. These particles were distinct with respect to size, and their enrichment in apoE and cholesterol esters. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated that particles found in the plasma of FIN-DKO mice migrated as large α3-HDL. Atherosclerosis analysis showed that FIN-DKO mice developed the greatest extent of aortic cholesterol accumulation compared to all other genotypes, including DKO mice which lack any apoA-I. Taken together these data suggest that the presence of large apoE enriched HDL particles containing apoA-I L159R lack the normal cholesterol efflux promoting properties of HDL, rendering them dysfunctional and pro-atherogenic. In conclusion, large HDL-like particles containing apoE and apoA-IL159R contribute rather than protect against atherosclerosis, possibly through defective efflux properties and their potential for aggregation at their site of interaction in the aorta.

Abstract: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) regulates lymphocyte trafficking via type-1 S1P receptor (S1P1) and participates in many pathological conditions. We developed a novel type S1P1-selective antagonist, TASP0251078, which is structurally unrelated to S1P. This competitive antagonist inhibited binding of S1P to S1P1 resulting in reduced signaling downstream of S1P1, including GTPγS-binding and cAMP formation. TASP0251078 also inhibited S1P-induced cellular responses such as chemotaxis and receptor-internalization. Furthermore, when administered in vivo, TASP0251078 induced lymphopenia in blood, which is different from previously reported effects of other S1P1-antagonists. In a mouse contact hypersensitivity model, TASP0251078 effectively suppressed ear swelling, leukocyte infiltration, and hyperplasia. These findings provide the chemical evidence that S1P1 antagonism is responsible for lymphocyte sequestration from the blood, and suggest that the effect of S1P1 agonists on lymphocyte sequestration results from their functional antagonism.

Abstract: Glycosphingolipids (GSLs), which are highly concentrated at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells, are key components of cell membranes and are involved in a large number of processes. Here, we investigated the ability of hypertonicity (high salt medium) to induce Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell differentiation and found an increase in GSL synthesis under hypertonic conditions. Then, we investigated the role of GSLs in MDCK cell differentiation induced by hypertonicity by using two approaches. First, cultured cells were depleted of GSLs by exposure to D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (D-PDMP). Second, cells were transfected with an siRNA specific to glucosylceramide synthase, the key enzyme in GSL synthesis. Exposure of cells to both treatments resulted in the impairment of the development of the apical membrane domain and the formation of the primary cilium. Enzymatic inhibitions of the de novo and the salvage pathway of GSL synthesis were used to determine the source of ceramide responsible of the GSL increase involved in the development of the apical membrane domain induced by hypertonicity. The results from this study show that extracellular hypertonicity induces the development of a differentiated apical membrane in MDCK cells by performing a sphingolipid metabolic program that includes the formation of a specific pool of GSLs. The results suggest as precursor a specific pool of ceramides formed by activation of a Fumonisin B1-resistant ceramide synthase as a component of the salvage pathway.

Abstract: High density lipoprotein (HDL) particles are made up of lipid and protein constituents and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is a principal protein component that facilitates various biological activities of HDL particles. Increase in Ox-PL content of HDL particles makes them ‘dysfunctional’ and such modified HDL particles not only lose their athero-protective properties but also acquire pro-atherogenic and pro-inflammatory functions. The details of Ox-PL‐induced alteration in the molecular properties of HDL particles are not clear. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an HDL-associated enzyme that possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties; and many of the athero-protective functions of HDL are attributed to the associated PON1. In this study we have characterized the physicochemical properties of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles containing varying amounts of Ox-PL and have compared their PON1 stimulation capacity. Our results show that increased Ox-PL content (a) modifies the physicochemical properties of the lipid domain of the rHDL particles, (b) decreases the stability and alters the conformation as well as orientation of apoA-I molecules on the rHDL particles, and (c) decreases the PON1 stimulation capacity of the rHDL particles. Our data indicate that the presence of Ox-PLs destabilizes the structure of the HDL particles and modifies their function.

Abstract: Ejaculated mammalian sperm must acquire fertilization capacity after residing into the female reproductive tract, a process collectively known as capacitation. Cholesterol efflux was required for sperm maturation. Different from flagellated sperm, C. elegans sperm are crawling cells. C. elegans sperm are highly enriched with cholesterol though this animal species lacks biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol and its survival requires an exogenous cholesterol supply. The low abundance of cholesterol in C. elegans lipid extract is thought insufficient to form lipid microdomains ubiquitously in this organism. We present evidence that cholesterol is enriched in the plasma membrane of C. elegans spermatids and that cholesterol- and glycosphingolipids (GSLs)-enriched membrane microdomains (lipid microdomains) mediate sperm activation. Disruption of sperm lipid microdomains by acute manipulation of cholesterol in vitro blocks the sperm activation. Restriction of cholesterol uptake also results in the abnormal sperm activation in both males and hermaphrodites. Manipulation of the integrity of lipid microdomains by targeting the biosynthesis of GSLs inhibits sperm activation and the inhibition can be rescued by the addition of exogenous GSLs. The cleavage of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which are exclusively found in lipid microdomains, also affects sperm activation. We conclude that localized signaling mediated by lipid microdomains is critical for worm sperm activation. Lipid microdomains composed of cholesterol and GSLs have been observed in flagellated sperm of several animal species, thus cholesterol, before its efflux from the plasma membrane, might be needed to assemble into a platform for some more important upstream signal sorting during spermatogenesis than was previously thought.

Abstract: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most widely consumed pharmaceuticals, yet both the mechanisms involved in their therapeutic actions and side-effects, notably gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration/bleeding, have not been clearly defined. In this study, we have used a number of biochemical, structural, computational and biological systems including; Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, and cell culture using a specific fluorescent membrane probe, to demonstrate that NSAIDs have a strong affinity to form ionic and hydrophobic associations with zwitterionic phospholipids, and specifically phosphatidylcholine (PC), that are reversible and non-covalent in nature. We propose that the pH-dependent partition of these potent anti-inflammatory drugs into the phospholipid bilayer, and possibly extracellular mono/multilayers present on the luminal interface of the mucus gel layer, may result in profound changes in the hydrophobicity, fluidity, permeability, biomechanical properties and stability of these membranes and barriers. These changes may not only provide an explanation of how NSAIDs induce surface injury to the GI mucosa as a component in the pathogenic mechanism leading to peptic ulceration and bleeding, but potentially an explanation for a number of (COX-independent) biological actions of this family of pharmaceuticals. This insight also has proven useful in the design and development of a novel class of PC-associated NSAIDs that have reduced GI toxicity while maintaining their essential therapeutic efficacy to inhibit pain and inflammation.

Abstract: The mechanisms linking low-grade chronic inflammation with obesity-induced insulin resistance have only been partially elucidated. PPARβ/δ and SIRT1 might play a role in this association. In visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from obese insulin‐resistant patients we observed enhanced p65 nuclear translocation and elevated expression of the pro‐inflammatory cytokines TNF‐α and IL‐6 compared to control subjects. Inflammation was accompanied by a reduction in the levels of SIRT1 protein and an increase in PPARβ/δ mRNA levels. Stimulation of human mature SGBS adipocytes with TNF‐α caused similar changes in PPARβ/δ and SIRT1 to those reported in obese patients. Unexpectedly, PPAR DNA‐binding activity and the expression of PPARβ/δ‐target genes was reduced following TNF‐α stimulation, suggesting that the activity of this transcription factor was inhibited by cytokine treatment. Interestingly, the PPARβ/δ ligand GW501516 prevented the expression of inflammatory markers and the reduction in the expression of PPARβ/δ‐target genes in adipocytes stimulated with TNF‐α. Consistent with a role for NF‐κB in the changes caused by TNF‐α, treatment with the NF‐κB inhibitor parthenolide restored PPAR DNA‐binding activity, the expression of PPARβ/δ‐target genes and the expression of SIRT1 and PPARβ/δ. These findings suggest that the reduction in PPARβ/δ activity and SIRT1 expression caused by TNF‐α stimulation through NF‐κB helps perpetuate the inflammatory process in human adipocytes.

Abstract: Maintenance of the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for the survival of erythrocytes. Various stimuli have been shown to induce scrambling of phospholipids and thereby exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS). In two types of patients, both with aberrant plasma cholesterol levels, we observed an aberrant PS exposure in erythrocytes upon stimulation. We investigated the effect of high and low levels of cholesterol on the ATP-dependent flippase, which maintains phospholipid asymmetry, and the ATP-independent scrambling activity, which breaks down phospholipid asymmetry. We analyzed erythrocytes of a patient with spur cell anemia, characterized by elevated plasma cholesterol, and the erythrocytes of Tangier disease patients with very low levels of plasma cholesterol. In normal erythrocytes, loaded with cholesterol or depleted of cholesterol in vitro, the same analyses were performed. Changes in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of erythrocytes had marked effects on PS exposure upon cell activation. Excess cholesterol profoundly inhibited PS exposure, whereas cholesterol depletion led to increased PS exposure. The activity of the ATP‐dependent flippase was not changed, suggesting a major influence of cholesterol on the outward translocation of PS. The effects of cholesterol were not accompanied by eminent changes in cytoskeletal and membrane proteins. These findings emphasize the importance of cholesterol exchange between circulating plasma and the erythrocyte membrane as determinant for phosphatidylserine exposure in erythrocytes.

Abstract: The PAT family of lipid storage droplet proteins comprised five members, each of which has become an established regulator of cellular neutral lipid metabolism. Perilipin 5 (also known as lsdp-5, MLDP, PAT-1, and OXPAT), the most recently discovered member of the family, has been shown to localize to two distinct intracellular pools: the lipid storage droplet (LD), and a poorly characterized cytosolic fraction. We have characterized the denser of these intracellular pools and find that a population of perilipin 5 not associated with large LDs resides in complexes with a discrete density (~1.15g/ml) and size (~575kDa). Using immunofluorescence, western blotting of isolated sucrose density fractions, native gradient gel electrophoresis, and co-immunoprecipitation, we have shown that these small (~15nm), perilipin 5-encoated structures do not contain the PAT protein perilipin 2 (ADRP), but do contain perilipin 3 and several other as of yet uncharacterized proteins. The size and density of these particles as well as their susceptibility to degradation by lipases suggest that like larger LDs, they have a neutral lipid rich core. When treated with oleic acid to promote neutral lipid deposition, cells ectopically expressing perilipin 5 experienced a reorganization of LDs in the cell, resulting in fewer, larger droplets at the expense of smaller ones. Collectively, these data demonstrate that a portion of cytosolic perilipin 5 resides in high density lipid droplet complexes that participate in cellular neutral lipid accumulation.

Abstract: In a previous study (Spanova et al., 2010, J. Biol. Chem., 285, 6127–6133) we demonstrated that squalene, an intermediate of sterol biosynthesis, accumulates in yeast strains bearing a deletion of the HEM1 gene. In such strains, the vast majority of squalene is stored in lipid particles/droplets together with triacylglycerols and steryl esters. In mutants lacking the ability to form lipid particles, however, substantial amounts of squalene accumulate in organelle membranes. In the present study, we investigated the effect of squalene on biophysical properties of lipid particles and biological membranes and compared these results to artificial membranes. Our experiments showed that squalene together with triacylglycerols forms the fluid core of lipid particles surrounded by only a few steryl ester shells which transform into a fluid phase below growth temperature. In the hem1∆ deletion mutant a slight disordering effect on steryl esters was observed indicated by loss of the high temperature transition. Also in biological membranes from the hem1∆ mutant strain the effect of squalene per se is difficult to pinpoint because multiple effects such as levels of sterols and unsaturated fatty acids contribute to physical membrane properties. Fluorescence spectroscopic studies using endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and artificial membranes revealed that it is not the absolute squalene level in membranes but rather the squalene to sterol ratio which mainly affects membrane fluidity/rigidity. In a fluid membrane environment squalene induces rigidity of the membrane, whereas in rigid membranes there is almost no additive effect of squalene. In summary, our results demonstrate that squalene (i) can be well accommodated in yeast lipid particles and organelle membranes without causing deleterious effects; and (ii) although not being a typical membrane lipid may be regarded as a mild modulator of biophysical membrane properties.

Abstract: Although sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant phospholipid in the plasma, next to phosphatidylcholine (PC), its physiological function in plasma is unclear. Here we employed plasma from various genetic models of mice which naturally differ in their plasma SM/PC ratios, to study the role of SM as a modulator of LCAT, the enzyme responsible for HDL maturation and the synthesis of cholesteryl esters (CE) in normal plasma. Serine palmitoyltransferase deficient mice, and SM synthase deficient mice, both of which have below normal SM/PC ratios, showed significantly elevated LCAT activities when assayed with the endogenous substrates. On the other hand, LDL receptor knockout mice, and apo E knockout mice, both of which have high SM/PC ratios, had markedly reduced (−80%) LCAT activities. The LCAT levels in plasma, as assayed with an exogenous substrate, were similar in all groups, except for a 45% decrease in apo E knockout mice. Plasma samples with high SM/PC ratios had lower percentage of 20:4, 22:5, and 22:6 CE all of which are formed by LCAT, and a higher percentage of the atherogenic 18:1 CE which is mainly derived from the action of liver ACAT, showing that in vivo, the contribution of LCAT to plasma CE is reduced while that of liver ACAT is increased. These results show that SM is a physiological modulator of LCAT activity as well as plasma CE composition, and this may contribute to the previously reported pro-atherogenic effect of high plasma SM levels.

MAFP was found here to be an irreversible inhibitor of human pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (HPLRP2), an enzyme displaying lipase, phospholipase A1 and galactolipase activities. In the presence of MAFP, mass spectrometry analysis of HPLRP2 revealed a mass increase of 351Da, suggesting a covalent binding of MAFP to the active site serine residue. When HPLRP2 was pre-incubated with MAFP before measuring residual activity, a direct inhibition of HPLRP2 occurred, confirming that HPLRP2 has an active site freely accessible to solvent and differs from most lipases in solution. HPLRP2 activities on tributyrin (TC4), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and monogalactosyl dioctanoylglycerol (C8-MGDG) were equally inhibited under these conditions. Bile salts were not required to trigger the inhibition, but they significantly increased the rate of HPLRP2 inhibition, probably because of MAFP micellar solubilization. Since HPLRP2 is active on various substrates that self-organize differently in the presence of water, HPLRP2 inhibition by MAFP was tested in the presence of these substrates after adding MAFP in the course of the lipolysis reaction. In this case, the rates of inhibition of lipase, phospholipase A1 and galactolipase activities were not equivalent (triglycerides>PC>MGDG), suggesting different enzyme/inhibitor partitioning between the aqueous phase and lipid aggregates. The inhibition by MAFP of a well identified phospholipase A1 (HPLRP2), present in pancreatic juice and also in human monocytes, indicates that MAFP cannot be used for discriminating phospholipase A2 from A1 activities at the cellular level.

Abstract: Regulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis in proliferating and NGF-differentiated PC12 pheochromocytoma cells deficient in n−3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6n−3) was studied. A dose- and time-dependent increase in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n−3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n−3) and DHA in phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) glycerophospholipids (GPL) via the elongation/desaturation pathway following alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n−3) supplements was observed. That was accompanied by a marked reduction of eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid 20:3n−9), an index of PUFA deficiency. EPA supplements were equally effective converted to 22:5n−3 and 22:6n−3. On the other hand, supplements of linoleic acid (LNA, 18:2n−6) were not effectively converted into higher n−6 PUFA intermediates nor did they impair elongation/desaturation of ALA. Co-supplements of DHA along with ALA did not interfere with 20:5n−3 biosynthesis but reduced further elongation to 22-hydrocarbon PUFA intermediates. A marked decrease in the newly synthesized 22:5n−3 and 22:6n−3 following ALA or EPA supplements was observed after nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation. NGF also inhibited the last step in 22:5n−6 formation from LNA. These results emphasize the importance of overcoming n−3 PUFA deficiency and raise the possibility that growth factor regulation of the last step in PUFA biosynthesis may constitute an important feature of neuronal phenotype acquisition.

Abstract: 3β-Hydroxysterol Δ24-reductase (DHCR24) catalyzes a final step in cholesterol synthesis, and has been ascribed diverse functions, such as being anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory. How this enzyme is regulated transcriptionally by sterols is currently unclear. Some studies have suggested that its expression is regulated by Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) while another suggests it is through the Liver X Receptor (LXR). However, these transcription factors have opposing effects on cellular sterol levels, so it is likely that one predominates. Here we establish that sterol regulation of DHCR24 occurs predominantly through SREBP-2, and identify the particular region of the DHCR24 promoter to which SREBP-2 binds. We demonstrate that sterol regulation is mediated by two sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter of the gene, assisted by two nearby NF-Y binding sites. Moreover, we present evidence that the dual SREs work cooperatively to regulate DHCR24 expression by comparison to two known SREBP target genes, the LDL receptor with one SRE, and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1, with two SREs.

Abstract: The oxysterol 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25EC) can affect cholesterol metabolism at multiple points. Previously, we proposed that 24,25EC has an especially significant role in fine-tuning cholesterol synthesis, since it parallels cholesterol production, and without it, acute cholesterol synthesis is exaggerated. 24,25EC is structurally similar to desmosterol, a substrate for the enzyme 3β-hydroxysterol ∆24-reductase (DHCR24, also called Seladin-1) which catalyzes a final step in cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we reveal a novel mode by which 24,25EC can regulate cholesterol synthesis, by interfering with DHCR24, resulting in the rapid accumulation of the substrate desmosterol, at the expense of cholesterol. This effect was independent of DHCR24 protein levels, and was observed in multiple mammalian cell-lines, including those of hepatic and neuronal origin. Conversely, overexpression of DHCR24 blunted the inhibition by 24,25EC. We also determined that the specificity of this effect was restricted to certain side-chain oxysterols, notably those oxygenated at C-25. Importantly, endogenous levels of 24,25EC, manipulated by genetic and pharmacological methods, were sufficient to reduce DHCR24 activity. Together, our work introduces a novel role for 24,25EC in cholesterol homeostasis, through its rapid inhibition of cholesterol synthesis at DHCR24. Also, our work provides new insights into a little studied area, the post-transcriptional regulation of DHCR24, an important enzyme in human health and disease.

Abstract: Disruption of the Pex2 gene leads to peroxisome deficiency and widespread metabolic dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that peroxisomes are critical for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, using peroxisome-deficient Pex2−/− mice on a hybrid Swiss Webster×129S6/SvEv (SW/129) genetic background. Peroxisome deficiency activates hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, leading to dysregulation of the endogenous sterol response mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a more profound dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in newborn Pex2−/− mice congenic on a 129S6/SvEv (129) genetic background, and substantial differences between newborn versus postnatal Pex2−/− mice in factors that activate ER stress. These differences extend to relationships between activation of genes regulated by SREBP-2 versus PPARα. The SREBP-2 pathway is induced in neonatal Pex2−/− livers from 129 and SW/129 strains, despite normal hepatic cholesterol levels. ER stress markers are increased in newborn 129 Pex2−/− livers, which occurs in the absence of hepatic steatosis or accumulation of peroxins in the ER. Moreover, the induction of SREBP-2 and ER stress pathways is independent of PPARα activation in livers of newborn 129 and SW/129 Pex2−/− mice. Two-week-old wild-type mice treated with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 show strong induction of PPARα-regulated genes and decreased expression of SREBP-2 and its target genes, further demonstrating that SREBP-2 pathway induction is not dependent on PPARα activation. Lastly, there is no activation of either SREBP-2 or ER stress pathways in kidney and lung of newborn Pex2−/− mice, suggesting a parallel induction of these pathways in peroxisome-deficient mice. These findings establish novel associations between SREBP-2, ER stress and PPARα pathway inductions.

ORP10, a cholesterol binding protein associated with microtubules, regulates apolipoprotein B-100 secretion,

Abstract: ORP10/OSBPL10 is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family, and genetic variation in OSBPL10 is associated with dyslipidemias and peripheral artery disease. In this study we investigated the ligand binding properties of ORP10 in vitro as well as its localization and function in human HuH7 hepatocytes. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ORP10 selectively interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, while the C-terminal ligand binding domain binds cholesterol and several acidic phospholipids. Full-length ORP10 decorates microtubules (MT), while the ORP10 N-terminal fragment (aa 1–318) localizes at Golgi membranes. Removal of the C-terminal aa 712–764 of ORP10 containing a predicted coiled-coil segment abolishes the MT association, but allows partial Golgi targeting. A PH domain-GFP fusion protein is distributed mainly in the cytosol and the plasma membrane, indicating that the Golgi affinity of ORP10 involves other determinants in addition to the PH domain. HuH7 cells expressing ORP10-specific shRNA display increased accumulation of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), but not of albumin, in culture medium, and contain reduced levels of intracellular apoB-100. Pulse-chase analysis of cellular [35S]apoB-100 demonstrates enhanced apoB-100 secretion by cells expressing ORP10-specific shRNA. The apoB-100 secretion phenotype is replicated in HepG2 cells transduced with the ORP10 shRNA lentiviruses. As a conclusion, the present study dissects the determinants of ORP10 association with MT and the Golgi complex and provides evidence for a specific role of this protein in β-lipoprotein secretion by human hepatocytes.

Abstract: Solea senegalensis is an unusual marine teleost as it has very low dietary requirement for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) during early development. Aquaculture is rapidly becoming the main source of health-beneficial fish products for human consumption. This, associated with limited supply of LC-PUFA-rich ingredients for fish feeds, render S. senegalensis a highly interesting species in which to study the LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway. We have cloned and functionally characterized fatty acyl desaturase and elongase cDNAs corresponding to Δ4fad (with some Δ5 activity for the n−3 series) and elovl5 with the potential to catalyze docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) biosynthesis from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Changes in expression of both transcripts were determined during embryonic and early larval development, and transcriptional regulation in response to higher or lower dietary n−3 LC-PUFA was assessed during larval and post-larval stages. There was a marked pattern of regulation during early ontogenesis, with both transcripts showing peak expression coinciding with the start of exogenous feeding. Although elovl5 transcripts were present in fertilized eggs, Δ4fad only appeared at hatching. However, eggs have high proportions of DHA (~20%) and high DHA/EPA ratio (~11) to meet the high demands for early embryonic development. The fatty acid profile of larvae after the start of exogenous feeding closely reflected dietary composition. Nonetheless, Δ4fad was significantly up-regulated in response to LC-PUFA-poor diets, which may suggest biological relevance of this pathway in reducing LC-PUFA dietary requirements in this species, compared to other marine teleosts. These results indicate that sole is capable of synthesizing DHA from EPA through a Sprecher-independent pathway.

Abstract: Protein kinase Cα (PKCα) is activated by its translocation to the membrane. Activity assays show the importance of PIP2 in determining the specific activity of this enzyme. A FRET stopped flow fluorescence study was carried out to monitor the rapid kinetics of protein binding to model membranes containing POPC/POPS/DOG and eventually PIP2. The results best fitted a binding mechanism in which protein bound to the membrane following a two-phase mechanism with a first bimolecular reaction followed by a slow unimolecular reaction. In the absence of PIP2, the rapid protein binding rate was especially dependent on POPS concentration. Formation of the slow high affinity complex during the second phase seems to involve specific interactions with POPS and DOG since it is only sensitive to changes within relatively low concentration ranges of these lipids. Both the association and dissociation rate constants fell in the presence of PIP2. We propose a model in which PKCα binds to the membranes via a two-step mechanism consisting of the rapid membrane initial recruitment of PKCα driven by interactions with POPS and/or PIP2 although interactions with DOG are involved too. PKCα searches on the lipid bilayer in two dimensions to establish interactions with its specific ligands.

Abstract: Cardiac hypertrophy is characterised by an imbalance between lipid uptake and fatty acid β-oxidation leading to an accumulation of lipids, particularly triacylglycerol (TAG). It is unclear whether uptake mechanisms such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) can be attenuated to diminish this uptake. Rats were cold acclimated to induce cardiac hypertrophy and increase cardiac LPL. Lipid uptake and metabolism were altered by feeding a ‘Western-style’ high fat diet (WSD) or feeding oxfenicine (2g/L) in the drinking water. Diastolic stiffness (increased volume change/unit pressure change) was induced in hypertrophied hearts for rats fed WSD (P<0.05) or WSD+oxfenicine (P<0.01), although absolute performance of cardiac muscle, estimated from stress–strain calculations was unchanged. Cold acclimation increased cardiac endothelial LPL (P<0.05) but this was diminished following oxfenicine. Following WSD LPL was further decreased below WSD-fed control hearts (P<0.05) with no further decrease by oxfenicine supplementation. A negative correlation was noted between plasma TAG and endothelial LPL (correlation coefficient=−0.654; P<0.001) but not cardiac TAG concentration. Transcript levels of angiopoietin-like protein-4 (ANGPTL4) were increased 6-fold by WSD (P<0.05) and increased 15-fold following WSD+oxfenicine (P<0.001). For CA-hearts fed WSD or WSD+oxfenicine ANGPTL4 mRNA levels were preserved at chow-fed levels. VLDLR protein levels were increased 10-fold (P<0.01) by CA. ANGPTL4 protein levels were increased 2-fold (P<0.05) by WSD, but restored following oxfenicine. For CA-hearts WSD increased ANGPTL4 protein levels 3-fold (P<0.01) with WSD+oxfenicine increasing ANGPTL4 protein 4-fold (P<0.01). These data suggest that endothelial LPL levels in the heart are altered to maintain FA flux and may exploit ANGPTL4.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are neutral lipid-rich organelles involved in many cellular processes. A well-known example is their accumulation in leukocytes upon activation by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from gram-negative bacteria. A role of LDs and LD-associated proteins during inflammation in the brain is unknown, however. We have now studied their dynamics and regulation in microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain. We find that LPS treatment of microglia leads to the accumulation in them of LDs, and enhancement of the size of LDs. This induction of LDs was abolished by triacsin C, an inhibitor of triglyceride biosynthesis. LPS strongly activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK stress signaling pathways and increased the expression of LD-associated protein perilipin-2 (ADRP) in a time-dependent manner. Immunostaining showed that perilipin-2 in LPS-treated microglia predominantly colocalized with LDs. Inhibitors of p38 α/β (SB203580) and PI3K/Akt pathway (LY294002), but not that of JNK (SP600125), reduced LPS-induced LD accumulation and eliminated the activating effect of LPS on perilipin-2. In addition, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2-α), a key enzyme for arachidonic acid release, colocalized with LPS-induced LDs. These observations suggest that LDs may play an important role in eicosanoid synthesis in activated microglia; they provide a novel insight into the regulation of LDs in inflammatory cells of the brain and point to a potential role of p38 α/β in LPS-induced LD accumulation. Collectively, our findings imply that LD formation and perilipin-2 induction could be microglial biomarkers of inflammation in the central nervous system.

Abstract: To develop a detailed double belt model for discoidal HDL, we previously scored inter-helical salt bridges between all possible registries of two stacked antiparallel amphipathic helical rings of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. The top score was the antiparallel apposition of helix 5 with 5 followed closely by appositions of helix 5 with 4 and helix 5 with 6. The rationale for the current study is that, for each of the optimal scores, a pair of identical residues can be identified in juxtaposition directly on the contact edge between the two antiparallel helical belts of apoA-I. Further, these residues are always in the ‘9th position’ in one of the eighteen 11-mer repeats that make up the lipid-associating domain of apoA-I. To illustrate our terminology, 129j (LL5/5) refers to the juxtaposition of the Cα atoms of G129 (in a ‘9th position’) in the pairwise helix 5 domains. We reasoned that if identical residues in the double belt juxtapositions were mutated to a cysteine and kept under reducing conditions during disc formation, we would have a precise method for determining registration in discoidal HDL by formation of a disulfide-linked apoA-I homodimer. Using this approach, we conclude that 129j (LL5/5) is the major rotamer orientation for double belt HDL and propose that the small ubiquitous gap between the pairwise helix 5 portions of the double belt in larger HDL discoidal particles is significantly dynamic to hinge off the disc edge under certain conditions, e.g., in smaller particles or perhaps following binding of the enzyme LCAT.

Abstract: Enzymes of the CYP74 family (P450 superfamily) play a key role in the plant lipoxygenase signalling cascade. Recently we detected a pathogen inducible divinyl ether synthase (DES) in flax leaves [Chechetkin, Blufard, Hamberg, Grechkin, 2008]. This prompted us to examine the CYP74 genes in the flax leaf transcriptome. Since the flax genome is not sequenced, we used the PCR approach with degenerate primers related to the conserved domains of selected CYP74 genes; this revealed several CYP74 transcripts in flax leaves. One transcript belongs to the previously described allene oxide synthase (LuAOS, CYP74A, GenBank ID: U00428.1). Another one contains the ORF (1473bp) of an unknown CYP74B16 gene. Three more nearly identical sequences, including one expressed pseudogene, were also identified. The recombinant CYP74B16 protein expressed in Escherichia coli had 491 amino acid residues and MW of 56kDa. The preferred substrate of this enzyme is the 13-hydroperoxide of α-linolenic acid, and the reaction product was identified by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV spectroscopy as the divinyl ether (9Z,11E)-12-[(1′Z,3′Z)-hexadienyloxy]-9,11-dodecadienoic acid, (ω5Z)-etherolenic acid. All previously known CYP74B subfamily enzymes are hydroperoxide lyases. The novel flax enzyme CYP74B16 (LuDES) is an unprecedented DES member of the CYP74B subfamily.

Abstract: Niemann–Pick disease type C (NPC) is caused by mutations leading to loss of function of NPC1 or NPC2 proteins, resulting in accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes and lysosomes. We previously reported that expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is impaired in human NPC1−/− fibroblasts, resulting in reduced HDL particle formation and providing a mechanism for the reduced plasma HDL cholesterol seen in the majority of NPC1 patients. We also found that treatment of NPC1−/− fibroblasts with an agonist of liver X-receptor corrects ABCA1 expression and HDL formation and reduces lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. We have confirmed that ABCA1 expression is also reduced in NPC2−/− cells, and found that α-HDL particle formation is impaired in these cells. To determine whether selective up-regulation of ABCA1 can correct lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC disease cells and HDL particle formation, we produced and infected NPC1−/− and NPC2−/− fibroblasts with an adenovirus expressing full-length ABCA1 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (AdABCA1-EGFP). ABCA1-EGFP expression in NPC1−/− fibroblasts resulted in normalization of cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and α-HDL particle formation, plus a marked reduction in filipin staining of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes. In contrast, AdABCA1-EGFP treatment of NPC2−/− fibroblasts to normalize ABCA1 expression had no effect on cholesterol efflux to apoA-I or accumulation of excess cholesterol in lysosomes, and only partially corrected α-HDL formation by these cells. These results suggest that correction of ABCA1 expression can bypass the mutation of NPC1 but not NPC2 to mobilize excess cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes in NPC disease cells. Expression of ABCA1-EGFP in NPC1−/− cells increased cholesterol available for esterification and reduced levels of HMG-CoA reductase protein, effects that were abrogated by co-incubation with apoA-I. A model can be generated in which ABCA1 is able to mobilize cholesterol, to join the intracellular regulatory pool or to be effluxed for HDL particle formation, either directly or indirectly from the lysosomal membrane, but not from the lysosomal lumen.

Abstract: The widely expressed steroid hydroxylase CYP7B1 is involved in metabolism of a number of steroids reported to influence estrogen and androgen signaling. Several studies by us and other investigators have linked this enzyme to effects on estrogen receptor activation. In a previous report we examined the effect of CYP7B1-mediated hormone metabolism for estrogen-mediated response in kidney-derived HEK293 cells. In the current study we used an androgen response element (ARE) reporter system to examine androgen-dependent response of some CYP7B1 substrates and CYP7B1-formed metabolites in several cell lines derived from different tissues. The results indicate significantly lower androgen receptor activation by CYP7B1-formed steroid metabolites than by the corresponding steroid substrates, suggesting that CYP7B1-mediated catalysis may decrease some androgenic responses. Thus, CYP7B1-dependent metabolism may be of importance not only for estrogenic signaling but also for androgenic. This finding, that CYP7B1 activity may be a regulator of androgenic signaling by converting AR ligands into less active metabolites, is also supported by real-time RT-PCR experiment where a CYP7B1 substrate, but not the corresponding product, was able to stimulate known androgen-sensitive genes. Furthermore, our data indicate that the effects of some steroids on hormone response element reporter systems are cell line-specific. For instance, despite transfection of the same reporter systems, 5-androstene-3β,17β-diol strongly activates an androgen-dependent response element in prostate cancer cells whereas it elicits only ER-dependent responses in kidney HEK293 cells. Potential roles of cell-specific metabolism or comodulator expression for the observed differences are discussed.

Abstract: Microparticles (MPs) are membrane-bound vesicles shed normally or as a result of various (pathological) stimuli. MPs contain a wealth of bio-active macromolecules. Aminophospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is present on the surface of many MPs. As PS and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are related, yet distinct aminophospholipids, the purpose of this study was to systematically and directly assess PE exposure on MPs. We examined MPs from various human cellular sources (human breast cancer, endothelial, red and white blood cells) by flow cytometry using a PE-specific probe, duramycin, and two PS-specific probes, annexin V and lactadherin. PS and PE exposure percentage was comparable on vascular and blood cell-derived MPs (80–90% of MP-gated events). However, the percentage of malignant breast cancer MPs exposing PE (~90%) was significantly higher than PS (~50%). Thus, while PS and PE exposure can result from a general loss of membrane asymmetry, there may also be distinct mechanisms of PE and PS exposure on MPs that vary by cellular source.

Abstract: In this study, we compared the cytotoxic effects of natural conjugated linolenic acids (CLnAs) on human adenocarcinoma cells (DLD-1) in vitro, with the goal of finding CLnA isomers with strong cytotoxic effects. The antitumor effect of the CLnA with the strongest cytotoxic effect was then examined in mice. The results showed that all CLnA isomers have strong cytotoxic effects on DLD-1 cells, with jacaric acid (JA) having the strongest effect. Examination of the mechanism of cell death showed that CLnAs induce apoptosis in DLD-1 cells via lipid peroxidation. The intracellular levels of incorporated CLnAs were measured to examine the reason for differences in cytotoxic effects. These results showed that JA was taken into cells efficiently. Collectively, these results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of CLnAs is dependent on intracellular incorporation and induction of apoptosis via lipid peroxidation. JA also had a strong preventive antitumor effect in vivo in nude mice into which DLD-1 cells were transplanted. These results suggest that JA can be used as a dietary constituent for prevention of cancer.

Abstract: The ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) mediates free cholesterol efflux onto lipidated apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and plays an important role in macrophage reverse cholesterol transport thereby reducing atherosclerosis. However, how ABCG1 mediates the efflux of cholesterol onto lipidated apoA-I is unclear. Since the crystal structure of ABCG family is not available, other approaches such as site-directed mutagenesis have been widely used to identify amino acid residues important for protein functions. We noticed that ABCG1 contains a single cysteine residue in its putative transmembrane domains. This cysteine residue locates at position 514 (Cys514) within the third putative transmembrane domain and is highly conserved. Replacement of Cys514 with Ala (C514A) essentially abolished ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux onto lipidated apoA-I. Substitution of Cys514 with more conserved amino acid residues, Ser or Thr, also significantly decreased cholesterol efflux. However, mutation C514A had no detectable effect on protein stability and trafficking. Mutation C514A also did not affect the dimerization of ABCG1. Our findings demonstrated that the sulfhydryl group of Cys residue located at position 514 plays a critical role in ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux.

Abstract: The lipidic metabolite, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP), in its dioctanoyl form (DGPP 8:0), has been described as an antagonist for mammalian lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors LPA1 and LPA3. In this study we show that DGPP 8:0 does not antagonize LPA dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinases but strongly stimulated them in various mammalian cell lines. LPA and DGPP 8:0 stimulation of ERK1/2 occurred through different pathways. The DGPP 8:0 effect appeared to be dependent on PKC, Raf and MEK but was insensitive to pertussis toxin and did not involve G protein activation. Finally we showed that DGPP 8:0 effect on ERK1/2 was dependent on its dephosphorylation by a phosphatase activity sharing lipid phosphate phosphatase properties. The inhibition of this phosphatase activity by VPC32183, a previously characterized LPA receptor antagonist, blocked the DGPP 8:0 effect on ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, down-regulation of lipid phosphate phosphatase 1 (LPP1) expression by RNA interference technique also reduced DGPP 8:0-induced ERK1/2 activation. Consistently, over expression of LPP1 in HEK293 cells increases DGPP 8:0 hydrolysis and this increased activity was inhibited by VPC32183. In conclusion, DGPP 8:0 does not exert its effect by acting on a G protein coupled receptor, but through its dephosphorylation by LPP1, generating dioctanoyl phosphatidic acid which in turn activates PKC. These results suggest that LPP1 could have a positive regulatory function on cellular signaling processes such as ERK1/2 activation.

Abstract: ABC transporter G1 (ABCG1) plays a pivotal role in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and atherogenesis. We investigated whether, and how, retinoic acid receptors (RARs) regulate ABCG1 expression in macrophages. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an RAR ligand, increased ABCG1 protein levels and apoA-I/HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. Both ATRA and other RAR agonists, TTNPB and Am580, increased major transcripts driven by promoter B upstream of exon 5, though minor transcripts driven by promoter A upstream of exon 1 were only increased by ATRA. The stimulatory effects of ATRA on ABCG1 expression were completely abolished in the presence of RAR/RXR antagonists but were only partially canceled in the presence of an LXR antagonist. Adenovirus with overexpressed oxysterol sulfotransferase abolished the LXR pathway, as previously reported, and ATRA-responsiveness in ABCA1/ABCG1 expressions were respectively attenuated by 38 and 22% compared to the control virus. Promoter assays revealed that ABCG1 levels were regulated more by promoter B than promoter A, and ATRA activated promoter B in a liver X receptor-responsive element (LXRE)-dependent manner. Further, LXRE-B in intron 7, but not LXRE-A in intron 5, enhanced ATRA responsiveness under overexpression of all RAR isoforms—RARα/β/γ. In contrast, the activation of promoter B by TTNPB depended on LXRE-B and RARα, but not on RARβ/γ. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel-shift assays revealed a specific and direct repeat 4-dependent binding of RARα to LXRE-B. In conclusion, RAR ligands increase ABCA1/G1 expression and apoA-I/HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and modulate ABCG1 promoter activity via LXRE-dependent mechanisms.

Abstract: Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a membrane protein that plays a relevant role in the metabolism of fatty acid amides and esters. It degrades important neurotransmitters such as oleamide and anandamide, and it has been involved in a number of human pathological conditions, representing therefore a valuable target for biochemical and pharmacological research. In this study, we have investigated in vitro the structure–function relationship of rat and human FAAHs. In particular circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering measurements have been performed, in order to characterize the structural features of the two proteins, both in the presence and absence of the irreversible inhibitor methoxyarachidonyl-fluorophosphonate. The results demonstrate that the structural dynamics of the two FAAHs are different, despite their high sequence homology and overall similarity in temperature-dependence. Additionally, membrane binding and kinetic assays of both FAAHs indicate that also the functional properties of the two enzymes are different in their interaction with lipid bilayers and with exogenous inhibitors. These findings suggest that pre-clinical studies of FAAH-dependent human diseases based only on animal models should be interpreted with caution, and that the efficacy of new drugs targeted to FAAH should be tested in vitro, on both rat and human enzymes.

Abstract: Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 3 (LGI3) is a secreted protein and a member of LGI/epitempin family. We previously showed that LGI3 was highly expressed in brain and played regulatory roles in neuronal exocytosis and differentiation. Besides the nervous system, LGI3 was shown to be expressed in diverse tissues. In this study, we found that LGI3 and its receptor candidate ADAM23 were expressed in adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 cells. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes secreted a 60-kDa protein, a major secreted form of LGI3, which declined with adipocyte differentiation. LGI3 was also expressed in adipose tissue macrophages in the ob/ob mice and in macrophage cell line. The 60-kDa LGI3 protein was selectively increased in the ob/ob adipose tissues comparing with the lean mice. Pull-down experiments, coimmunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry indicated that LGI3 associated with ADAM23 in adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 cells. Knockdown of LGI3 or ADAM23 by siRNA increased adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment with LGI3 protein did not affect preadipocyte proliferation but attenuated adipogenesis and this effect was reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ADAM23. Taken together, we propose that LGI3 may be a candidate adipokine that is perturbed in obesity and suppresses adipogenesis through its receptor, ADAM23.

The ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine does not predict integrity of growing MT58 Chinese hamster ovary cells,

Abstract: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) homeostasis is important for maintaining cellular growth and survival. Cellular growth and apoptosis may also be influenced by the PC to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio as a reduction in this ratio can result in a loss of membrane integrity. To investigate whether a reduced PC:PE ratio influences cellular growth and apoptosis, we utilized the MT58 cell line, which contains a thermo-sensitive mutation in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-α, the rate-limiting enzyme for PC biosynthesis. Incubation of MT58 cells at the restrictive temperature of 41°C results in a reduction of cellular PC and induces apoptosis. Furthermore, MT58 cells have a 50% reduction in the PC:PE ratio when incubated at 41°C. In an attempt to normalize the PC:PE ratio, which may stabilize cellular membranes and rescue MT58 cells from apoptosis, the cells were treated with either silencing RNA to impair PE biosynthesis or lysophosphatidylcholine to increase PC mass. Impairing PE biosynthesis in MT58 cells reduced cellular PE and PC concentrations by 30% and 20%, but did not normalize the PC:PE ratio. Loss of both phospholipids enhanced the onset of apoptosis in MT58 cells. Lysophosphatidylcholine normalized cellular PC, increased PE mass by 10%, restored cellular growth and prevented apoptosis of MT58 cells without normalizing the PC:PE ratio. Furthermore, total amount of cellular PC and PE, but not the PC:PE ratio, correlated with cellular growth (R2=0.76), and inversely with cellular apoptosis (R2=0.97). These data suggest the total cellular amount of PC and PE, not the PC:PE ratio, influences growth and membrane integrity of MT58 cells.

Abstract: Mutations in ABCA1, APOA1, and LCAT reduce HDL cholesterol (HDLc) in humans. However, the prevalence of these mutations and their relative effects on HDLc reduction and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) are less clear. Here we searched for ABCA1, APOA1, and LCAT mutations in 178 unrelated probands with HDLc <10th percentile but no other major lipid abnormalities, including 89 with ≥1 first-degree relative with low HDLc (familial probands) and 89 where familial status of low HDLc is uncertain (unknown probands). Mutations were most frequent in LCAT (15.7%), followed by ABCA1 (9.0%) and APOA1 (4.5%), and were found in 42.7% of familial but only 14.6% of unknown probands (p=2.44∗10−5). Interestingly, only 16 of 24 (66.7%) mutations assessed in families conferred an average HDLc <10th percentile. Furthermore, only mutation carriers with HDLc <5th percentile had elevated risk of CAD (odds ratio (OR)=2.26 for 34 ABCA1 mutation carriers vs. 149 total first-degree relative controls, p=0.05; OR=2.50 for 26 APOA1 mutation carriers, p=0.04; OR=3.44 for 38 LCAT mutation carriers, p=1.1∗10−3). These observations show that mutations in ABCA1, APOA1, and LCAT are sufficient to explain >40% of familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia in this cohort. Moreover, individuals with mutations and large reductions in HDLc have increased risk of CAD.

Abstract: In N-glycosylation in both Eukarya and Archaea, N-linked oligosaccharides are assembled on dolichol phosphate prior to transfer of the glycan to the protein target. However, whereas only the α-position isoprene subunit is saturated in eukaryal dolichol phosphate, both the α- and ω-position isoprene subunits are reduced in the archaeal lipid. The agents responsible for dolichol phosphate saturation remain largely unknown. The present study sought to identify dolichol phosphate reductases in the halophilic archaeon, Haloferax volcanii. Homology-based searches recognize HVO_1799 as a geranylgeranyl reductase. Mass spectrometry revealed that cells deleted of HVO_1799 fail to fully reduce the isoprene chains of H. volcanii membrane phospholipids and glycolipids. Likewise, the absence of HVO_1799 led to a loss of saturation of the ω-position isoprene subunit of C55 and C60 dolichol phosphate, with the effect of HVO_1799 deletion being more pronounced with C60 dolichol phosphate than with C55 dolichol phosphate. Glycosylation of dolichol phosphate in the deletion strain occurred preferentially on that version of the lipid saturated at both the α- and ω-position isoprene subunits.

Abstract: We have previously shown in HK-2 cells that ATRA (all-trans-retinoic acid) up-regulates HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α) in normoxia, which results in increased production of renal protector VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor-A). Here we investigated the role of COXs (cyclooxygenases) in these effects and we found that, i) ATRA increased the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein and the intracellular levels (but not the extracellular ones) of PGE2. Furthermore, inhibitors of COX isoenzymes blocked ATRA-induced increase in intracellular PGE2, HIF-1α up-regulation and increased VEGF-A production. Immunofluorescence analysis found intracellular staining for EP1-4 receptors (PGE2 receptors). These results indicated that COX activity is critical for ATRA-induced HIF-1α up-regulation and suggested that intracellular PGE2 could mediate the effects of ATRA; ii) Treatment with PGE2 analog 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 resulted in up-regulation of HIF-1α and antagonists of EP1-4 receptors inhibited 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2- and ATRA-induced HIF-1α up-regulation. These results confirmed that PGE2 mediates the effects of ATRA on HIF-1α expression; iii) Prostaglandin uptake transporter inhibitor bromocresol green blocked the increase in HIF-1α expression induced by PGE2 or by PGE2-increasing cytokine interleukin-1β, but not by ATRA. Therefore only intracellular PGE2 is able to increase HIF-1α expression. In conclusion, intracellular PGE2 increases HIF-1α expression and mediates ATRA-induced HIF-1α up-regulation.

Triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins protect lipoprotein lipase from inactivation by ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4,

Abstract: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is important for clearance of triacylglycerols (TG) from plasma both as an enzyme and as a bridging factor between lipoproteins and receptors for endocytosis. The amount of LPL at the luminal side of the capillary endothelium determines to what extent lipids are taken up. Mechanisms to control both the activity of LPL and its transport to the endothelial sites are regulated, but poorly understood. Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3 and 4 are potential control proteins for LPL, but plasma concentrations of ANGPTLs do not correlate with plasma TG levels. We investigated the effects of recombinant human N-terminal (NT) ANGPTLs3 and 4 on LPL-mediated bridging of TG-rich lipoproteins to primary mouse hepatocytes and found that the NT-ANGPTLs, in concentrations sufficient to cause inactivation of LPL in vitro, were unable to prevent LPL-mediated lipoprotein uptake. We therefore investigated the effects of lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL) on the inactivation of LPL in vitro by NT-ANGPTLs3 and 4 and found that LPL activity was protected by TG-rich lipoproteins. In vivo, postprandial TG protected LPL from inactivation by recombinant NT-ANGPTL4 injected to mice. We conclude that lipoprotein-bound LPL is stabilized against inactivation by ANGPTLs. The levels of ANGPTLs found in blood may not be sufficient to overcome this stabilization. Therefore it is likely that the prime site of action of ANGPTLs on LPL is in subendothelial compartments where TG-rich lipoprotein concentration is lower than in blood. This could explain why the plasma levels of TG and ANGPTLs do not correlate.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein component of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and plays a central role in cholesterol metabolism. The lipid-free/lipid-poor form of apoA-I is the preferred substrate for the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). The interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 leads to the formation of cholesterol laden high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, a key step in reverse cholesterol transport and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. Knowledge of the structure of lipid-free apoA-I is essential to understanding its critical interaction with ABCA1 and the molecular mechanisms underlying HDL biogenesis. We therefore examined the structure of lipid-free apoA-I by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Through site directed spin label EPR, we mapped the secondary structure of apoA-I and identified sites of spin coupling as residues 26, 44, 64, 167, 217 and 226. We capitalize on the fact that lipid-free apoA-I self-associates in an anti-parallel manner in solution. We employed these sites of spin coupling to define the central plane in the dimeric apoA-I complex. Applying both the constraints of dipolar coupling with the EPR-derived pattern of solvent accessibility, we assembled the secondary structure into a tertiary context, providing a solution structure for lipid-free apoA-I.

Abstract: Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) regulates the hydrolysis of acylglycerols and cholesteryl esters (CE) in various cells and organs, including enterocytes of the small intestine. The physiological role of this enzyme in enterocytes, however, stayed elusive. In the present study we generated mice lacking HSL exclusively in the small intestine (HSLiKO) to investigate the impact of HSL deficiency on intestinal lipid metabolism and the consequences on whole body lipid homeostasis. Chow diet-fed HSLiKO mice showed unchanged plasma lipid concentrations. In addition, feeding with high fat/high cholesterol (HF/HC) diet led to unaltered triglyceride but increased plasma cholesterol concentrations and CE accumulation in the small intestine. The same effect was observed after an acute cholesterol load. Gavaging of radioactively labeled cholesterol resulted in increased abundance of radioactivity in plasma, liver and small intestine of HSLiKO mice 4h post-gavaging. However, cholesterol absorption determined by the fecal dual-isotope ratio method revealed no significant difference, suggesting that HSLiKO mice take up the same amount of cholesterol but in an accelerated manner. mRNA expression levels of genes involved in intestinal cholesterol transport and esterification were unchanged but we observed downregulation of HMG-CoA reductase and synthase and consequently less intestinal cholesterol biosynthesis. Taken together our study demonstrates that the lack of intestinal HSL leads to CE accumulation in the small intestine, accelerated cholesterol absorption and decreased cholesterol biosynthesis, indicating that HSL plays an important role in intestinal cholesterol homeostasis.

Abstract: Macrophages store excess unesterified cholesterol (free, FC) in the form of cholesteryl ester (CE) in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. The hydrolysis of droplet-CE in peripheral foam cells is critical to HDL-promoted reverse cholesterol transport because it represents the first step in cellular cholesterol clearance, as only FC is effluxed from cells to HDL. Cytoplasmic lipid droplets move within the cell utilizing the cytoskeletal network, but, little is known about the influence of the cytoskeleton on lipid droplet formation. To understand this role we employed cytochalasin D (cyt.D) to promote actin depolymerization in J774 macrophages. Incubating J774 with acetylated LDL creates foam cells having a 4-fold increase in cellular cholesterol content (30–40% cholesterol present as cholesteryl ester (CE)) in cytoplasmic droplets. Lipid droplets formed in the presence of cyt.D are smaller in diameter. CE-deposition and -hydrolysis are decreased when cells are cholesterol-enriched in the presence of cyt.D or latrunculin A, another cytoskeleton disrupting agent. However, when lipid droplets formed in the presence of cyt.D are isolated and incubated with an exogenous CE hydrolase, the CE is more rapidly metabolized compared to droplets from control cells. This is apparently due to the smaller size and altered lipid composition of the droplets formed in the presence of cyt.D. Cytoskeletal proteins found on CE droplets influence droplet lipid composition and maturation in model foam cells. In J774 macrophages, cytoskeletal proteins are apparently involved in facilitating the interaction of lipid droplets and a cytosolic neutral CE hydrolase and may play a role in foam cell formation.

Abstract: Arachidonic acid (AA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that stimulates the proliferation of many cellular types. We studied the mitogenic potential of AA in rat brown preadipocytes in culture and the signaling pathways involved. AA is a potent mitogen which induces 4-fold DNA synthesis in brown preadipocytes. The AA mitogenic effect increases by NE addition. AA also increases the mitogenic action of different growth factor combinations. Other unsaturated and saturated fatty acids do not stimulate DNA synthesis to the same extent as AA. We analyzed the role of PKC and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways. PKC inhibition by bisindolilmaleimide I (BIS) abolishes AA and phorbol ester stimulation of DNA synthesis and reduces the mitogenic activity of different growth factors in brown preadipocytes. Brown preadipocytes in culture express PKC α, δ, ε and ζ isoforms. Pretreatment with high doses of the phorbol ester PDBu, induces downregulation of PKCs ε and δ and reproduces the effect of BIS indicating that AA-dependent induction of DNA synthesis requires PKC activity. AA also activates MEK/MAPK pathway and the inhibition of MEK activity inhibits AA stimulation of DNA synthesis and brown adipocyte proliferation. Inhibition of PKC δ by rottlerin abolishes AA-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis and MAPK activation, whereas PKC ε inhibition does not produce any effect. In conclusion, our results identify AA as a potent mitogen for brown adipocytes and demonstrate the involvement of the PDBu-sensitive PKC δ isoform and MEK/MAPK pathway in AA-induced proliferation of brown adipocytes. Increased proliferative activity might increase the thermogenic capacity of brown fat.

Abstract: Local acidic areas characterize diffuse intimal thickening (DIT) and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The role of acidity in the modification and extra- and intracellular accumulation of triglyceride-rich VLDL and IDL particles has not been studied before. Here, we examined the effects of acidic pH on the activity of recombinant human group V secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-V) toward small VLDL (sVLDL), IDL, and LDL, on the binding of these apoB-100-containing lipoproteins to human aortic proteoglycans, and on their uptake by human monocyte-derived macrophages. At acidic pH, the ability of sPLA2-V to lipolyze the apoB-100-containing lipoproteins was moderately, but significantly, increased while binding of the lipoproteins to proteoglycans increased >60-fold and sPLA2-V-modification further doubled the binding. Moreover, acidic pH more than doubled macrophage uptake of soluble complexes of sPLA2-V–LDL with aortic proteoglycans. Proteoglycan-affinity chromatography at pH 7.5 and 5.5 revealed that sVLDL, IDL, and LDL consisted of populations with different proteoglycan-binding affinities, and, surprisingly, the sVLDL fractions with the highest proteoglycan-affinity contained only low amounts of apolipoproteins E and C-III. Our results suggest that in atherosclerotic lesions with acidic extracellular pH, sPLA2-V is able to lipolyze sVLDL, IDL, and LDL, and increase their binding to proteoglycans. This is likely to provoke extracellular accumulation of lipids derived from these atherogenic lipoprotein particles and to increase the progression of the atherosclerotic lesions.

Abstract: The truncated phospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC) are oxidation products of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine. Depending on concentration and the extent of modification, these compounds induce growth and death, differentiation and inflammation of vascular cells thus playing a role in the development of atherosclerosis. Here we describe the import of fluorescent POVPC and PGPC analogs into cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages and the identification of their primary protein targets. We found that the fluorescent oxidized phospholipids were rapidly taken up by the cells. The cellular target sites depended on the chemical reactivity of these compounds but not on the donor (aqueous lipid suspension, albumin or LDL). The great differences in cellular uptake of PGPC and POVPC are a direct consequence of the subtle structural differences between both molecules. The former compound (carboxyl lipid) can only physically interact with the molecules in its immediate vicinity. In contrast, the aldehydo-lipid covalently reacts with free amino groups of proteins by forming covalent Schiff bases, and thus becomes trapped in the cell surface. Despite covalent binding, POVPC is exchangeable between (lipo)proteins and cells, since imines are subject to proton-catalyzed base exchange. Protein targeting by POVPC is a selective process since only a limited subfraction of the total proteome was labeled by the fluorescent aldehydo-phospholipid. Chemically stabilized lipid–protein conjugates were identified by MS/MS. The respective proteins are involved in apoptosis, stress response, lipid metabolism and transport. The identified target proteins may be considered primary signaling platforms of the oxidized phospholipid.

Abstract: Diabetes and insulin resistance increase the risk of cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Lipid-loaded macrophages are key contributors to all stages of atherosclerosis. We have recently shown that diabetes associated with increased plasma lipids reduces cholesterol efflux and levels of the reverse cholesterol transporter ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) in mouse macrophages, which likely contributes to macrophage lipid accumulation in diabetes. Furthermore, we and others have shown that unsaturated fatty acids reduce ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, and that this effect is mediated by the acyl-CoA derivatives of the fatty acids. We therefore investigated whether acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1), a key enzyme mediating acyl-CoA synthesis in macrophages, could directly influence ABCA1 levels and cholesterol efflux in these cells. Mouse macrophages deficient in ACSL1 exhibited reduced sensitivity to oleate- and linoleate-mediated ABCA1 degradation, which resulted in increased ABCA1 levels and increased apolipoprotein A-I-dependent cholesterol efflux in the presence of these fatty acids, as compared with wildtype mouse macrophages. Conversely, overexpression of ACSL1 resulted in reduced ABCA1 levels and reduced cholesterol efflux in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, the reduced ABCA1 and cholesterol efflux in macrophages subjected to conditions of diabetes and elevated fatty load may, at least in part, be mediated by ACSL1. These observations raise the possibility that ABCA1 levels could be increased by inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase activity in vivo.

Abstract: Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and Apo J/clusterin are involved in inflammatory resolution and have each been reported to inhibit NF-κB signalling. Using a well-validated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell culture model of Cox-2 over-expression the current study investigated inter-dependence between Cox-2 and clusterin with respect to induction of expression and impact on NF-κB signalling. Both gene expression and immunoblot analysis confirmed that intracellular and secreted levels of clusterin were elevated in Cox-2 over-expressing cells (PCXII). Clusterin expression was increased in control (PCMT) cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), but not PGE2, and inhibited in PCXII cells by pharmacological Cox inhibition. In PCXII cells, inhibition of two transcription factors known to be activated by 15d-PGJ2, heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)γ, by transcription factor oligonucleotide decoy and antagonist (GW9662) treatment, respectively, reduced clusterin expression. While PCXII cells exhibited reduced TNF-α-induced cell surface ICAM-1 expression, IkB phosphorylation and degradation were similar to control cells. With respect to the impact of Cox-2-dependent clusterin upregulation on NF-κB signalling, basal levels of IκB were similar in control and PCXII cells, and no evidence for a physical association between clusterin and phospho-IκB was obtained. Moreover, while PCXII cells exhibited reduced NF-κB transcriptional activity, this was not restored by clusterin knock-down. These results indicate that Cox-2 induces clusterin in a 15d-PGJ2-dependent manner, and via activation of HSF-1 and PPARγ. However, the results do not support a model whereby Cox-2/15d-PGJ2-dependent inhibition of NF-κB signalling involves clusterin.

Abstract: The apoA-I molecule adopts a two-domain tertiary structure and the properties of these domains modulate the ability to form HDL particles. Thus, human apoA-I differs from mouse apoA-I in that it can form smaller HDL particles; the C-terminal α-helix is important in this process and human apoA-I is unusual in containing aromatic amino acids in the non-polar face of this amphipathic α-helix. To understand the influence of these aromatic amino acids and the associated high hydrophobicity, apoA-I variants were engineered in which aliphatic amino acids were substituted with or without causing a decrease in overall hydrophobicity. The variants human apoA-I (F225L/F229A/Y236A) and apoA-I (F225L/F229L/A232L/Y236L) were compared to wild-type (WT) apoA-I for their abilities to (1) solubilize phospholipid vesicles and form HDL particles of different sizes, and (2) mediate cellular cholesterol efflux and create nascent HDL particles via ABCA1. The loss of aromatic residues and concomitant decrease in hydrophobicity in apoA-I (F225L/F229A/Y236A) has no effect on protein stability, but reduces by a factor of about three the catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of vesicle solubilization and cholesterol efflux; also, relatively large HDL particles are formed. With apoA-I (F225L/F229L/A232L/Y236L) where the hydrophobicity is restored by the presence of only leucine residues in the helix non-polar face, the catalytic efficiencies of vesicle solubilization and cholesterol efflux are similar to those of WT apoA-I; this variant forms smaller HDL particles. Overall, the results show that the hydrophobicity of the non-polar face of the C-terminal amphipathic α-helix plays a critical role in determining apoA-I functionality but aromatic amino acids are not required.
