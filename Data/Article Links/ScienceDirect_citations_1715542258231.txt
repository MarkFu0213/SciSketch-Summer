Abstract: Summary
Climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals driving cerebellar learning, but mechanisms causing the variable CF responses in Purkinje cells (PCs) are not fully understood. Using a new experimentally validated PC model, we unveil the ionic mechanisms underlying CF-evoked distinct spike waveforms on different parts of the PC. We demonstrate that voltage can gate both the amplitude and the spatial range of CF-evoked Ca2+ influx by the availability of K+ currents. This makes the energy consumed during a complex spike (CS) also voltage dependent. PC dendrites exhibit inhomogeneous excitability with individual branches as computational units for CF input. The variability of somatic CSs can be explained by voltage state, CF activation phase, and instantaneous CF firing rate. Concurrent clustered synaptic inputs affect CSs by modulating dendritic responses in a spatially precise way. The voltage- and branch-specific CF responses can increase dendritic computational capacity and enable PCs to actively integrate CF signals.

Abstract: Summary
The ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway degrades nascent chains (NCs) arising from interrupted translation. First, recycling factors split stalled ribosomes, yielding NC-tRNA/60S ribosome-nascent chain complexes (60S RNCs). 60S RNCs associate with NEMF, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin that ubiquitinates NCs. The mechanism of subsequent ribosomal release of Ub-NCs remains obscure. We found that, in non-ubiquitinated 60S RNCs and 80S RNCs formed on non-stop mRNAs, tRNA is not firmly fixed in the P site, which allows peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase Ptrh1 to cleave NC-tRNA, suggesting the existence of a pathway involving release of non-ubiquitinated NCs. Association with NEMF and Listerin and ubiquitination of NCs results in accommodation of NC-tRNA, rendering 60S RNCs resistant to Ptrh1 but susceptible to ANKZF1, which induces specific cleavage in the tRNA acceptor arm, releasing proteasome-degradable Ub-NCs linked to four 3′-terminal tRNA nucleotides. We also found that TCF25, a poorly characterized RQC component, ensures preferential formation of the K48-ubiquitin linkage.

Abstract: Summary
Although aneuploidy is found in the majority of tumors, the degree of aneuploidy varies widely. It is unclear how cancer cells become aneuploid or how highly aneuploid tumors are different from those of more normal ploidy. We developed a simple computational method that measures the degree of aneuploidy or structural rearrangements of large chromosome regions of 522 human breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Highly aneuploid tumors overexpress activators of mitotic transcription and the genes encoding proteins that segregate chromosomes. Overexpression of three mitotic transcriptional regulators, E2F1, MYBL2, and FOXM1, is sufficient to increase the rate of lagging anaphase chromosomes in a non-transformed vertebrate tissue, demonstrating that this event can initiate aneuploidy. Highly aneuploid human breast tumors are also enriched in TP53 mutations. TP53 mutations co-associate with the overexpression of mitotic transcriptional activators, suggesting that these events work together to provide fitness to breast tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory cells undergo differentiation in germinal centers following antigen challenge, but the full effector cell potential of these cells is unknown. We monitored the differentiation of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP)-labeled CD11c+ and CD11cneg T-bet+ IgM memory cells after their transfer into naive recipient mice. Following challenge infection, many memory cells differentiated into IgM-producing plasmablasts. Other donor B cells entered germinal centers, downregulated CD11c, underwent class switch recombination, and became switched memory cells. Yet other donor cells were maintained as IgM memory cells, and these IgM memory cells retained their multi-lineage potential following serial transfer. These findings were corroborated at the molecular level using immune repertoire analyses. Thus, IgM memory cells can differentiate into all effector B cell lineages and undergo self-renewal, properties that are characteristic of stem cells. We propose that these memory cells exist to provide long-term multi-functional immunity and act primarily to maintain the production of protective antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
In vivo, replication forks proceed beyond replication-blocking lesions by way of downstream repriming, generating daughter strand gaps that are subsequently processed by post-replicative repair pathways such as homologous recombination and translesion synthesis (TLS). The way these gaps are filled during TLS is presently unknown. The structure of gap repair synthesis was assessed by sequencing large collections of single DNA molecules that underwent specific TLS events in vivo. The higher error frequency of specialized relative to replicative polymerases allowed us to visualize gap-filling events at high resolution. Unexpectedly, the data reveal that a specialized polymerase, Pol V, synthesizes stretches of DNA both upstream and downstream of a site-specific DNA lesion. Pol V-mediated untargeted mutations are thus spread over several hundred nucleotides, strongly eliciting genetic instability on either side of a given lesion. Consequently, post-replicative gap repair may be a source of untargeted mutations critical for gene diversification in adaptation and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Histone modifications influence higher-order chromatin structures at individual epigenomic states and chromatin environments to regulate gene expression. However, genome-wide higher-order chromatin structures shaped by different histone modifications remain poorly characterized. With stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we characterized the higher-order chromatin structures at their epigenomic states, categorized into three major types in interphase: histone acetylation marks form spatially segregated nanoclusters, active histone methylation marks form spatially dispersed larger nanodomains, and repressive histone methylation marks form condensed large aggregates. These distinct structural characteristics are also observed in mitotic chromosomes. Furthermore, active histone marks coincide with less compact chromatin and exhibit a higher degree of co-localization with other active marks and RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), while repressive marks coincide with densely packed chromatin and spatially distant from repressive marks and active RNAP II. Taken together, super-resolution imaging reveals three distinct chromatin structures at various epigenomic states, which may be spatially coordinated to impact transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative polyadenylation generates numerous 3′ mRNA isoforms that can vary in biological properties, such as stability and localization. We developed methods to obtain transcriptome-scale structural information and protein binding on individual 3′ mRNA isoforms in vivo. Strikingly, near-identical mRNA isoforms can possess dramatically different structures throughout the 3′ UTR. Analyses of identical mRNAs in different species or refolded in vitro indicate that structural differences in vivo are often due to trans-acting factors. The level of Pab1 binding to poly(A)-containing isoforms is surprisingly variable, and differences in Pab1 binding correlate with the extent of structural variation for closely spaced isoforms. A pattern encompassing single-strandedness near the 3′ terminus, double-strandedness of the poly(A) tail, and low Pab1 binding is associated with mRNA stability. Thus, individual 3′ mRNA isoforms can be remarkably different physical entities in vivo. Sequences responsible for isoform-specific structures, differential Pab1 binding, and mRNA stability are evolutionarily conserved, indicating biological function.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic metabolic diseases have been linked to molecular signatures of mitochondrial dysfunction. Nonetheless, molecular remodeling of the transcriptome, proteome, and/or metabolome does not necessarily translate to functional consequences that confer physiologic phenotypes. The work here aims to bridge the gap between molecular and functional phenomics by developing and validating a multiplexed assay platform for comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial energy transduction. The diagnostic power of the platform stems from a modified version of the creatine kinase energetic clamp technique, performed in parallel with multiplexed analyses of dehydrogenase activities and ATP synthesis rates. Together, these assays provide diagnostic coverage of the mitochondrial network at a level approaching that gained by molecular “-omics” technologies. Application of the platform to a comparison of skeletal muscle versus heart mitochondria reveals mechanistic insights into tissue-specific distinctions in energy transfer efficiency. This platform opens exciting opportunities to unravel the connection between mitochondrial bioenergetics and human disease.

Abstract: Summary
We present a method for automatically discovering signaling pathways from time-resolved phosphoproteomic data. The Temporal Pathway Synthesizer (TPS) algorithm uses constraint-solving techniques first developed in the context of formal verification to explore paths in an interaction network. It systematically eliminates all candidate structures for a signaling pathway where a protein is activated or inactivated before its upstream regulators. The algorithm can model more than one hundred thousand dynamic phosphosites and can discover pathway members that are not differentially phosphorylated. By analyzing temporal data, TPS defines signaling cascades without needing to experimentally perturb individual proteins. It recovers known pathways and proposes pathway connections when applied to the human epidermal growth factor and yeast osmotic stress responses. Independent kinase mutant studies validate predicted substrates in the TPS osmotic stress pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated long-term depression (LTD) requires dopamine (DA) D2 receptors (D2Rs) for eCB mobilization. The cellular locus of the D2Rs involved in LTD induction remains highly debated. We directly examined the role in LTD induction of D2Rs expressed by striatal cholinergic interneurons (Chls) and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) using neuron-specific targeted deletion of D2Rs. Deletion of Chl-D2Rs (Chl-Drd2KO) impaired LTD induction in both subtypes of MSNs. LTD induction was restored in the Chl-Drd2KO mice by an M1-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. In contrast, after the deletion of iMSN-D2Rs (iMSN-Drd2KO), LTD induction was intact in MSNs. Separate interrogation of direct pathway and iMSNs revealed a deficit in LTD induction only at synapses onto iMSNs that lack D2Rs. LTD induction in iMSNs was restored by D2R agonist application. Our findings suggest that Chl D2Rs strongly modulate LTD induction in MSNs, with iMSN-D2Rs having a weaker, iMSN-specific, modulatory effect.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence indicates that heterogeneity in ribosome composition can give rise to specialized functions. Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The effect of posttranslational modifications has not been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging because individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S, and polysomes). Here we develop polysome proteome profiling to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. Our method combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on the fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12/uL11, a known mitotic CDK1 substrate, is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12/uL11 phosphorylation regulates the translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis. Together, our results show that posttranslational modification of ribosomal proteins can regulate translation.

Abstract: Summary
Adherens junctions are tensile structures that couple epithelial cells together. Junctional tension can arise from cell-intrinsic application of contractility or from the cell-extrinsic forces of tissue movement. Here, we report a mechanosensitive signaling pathway that activates RhoA at adherens junctions to preserve epithelial integrity in response to acute tensile stress. We identify Myosin VI as the force sensor, whose association with E-cadherin is enhanced when junctional tension is increased by mechanical monolayer stress. Myosin VI promotes recruitment of the heterotrimeric Gα12 protein to E-cadherin, where it signals for p114 RhoGEF to activate RhoA. Despite its potential to stimulate junctional actomyosin and further increase contractility, tension-activated RhoA signaling is necessary to preserve epithelial integrity. This is explained by an increase in tensile strength, especially at the multicellular vertices of junctions, that is due to mDia1-mediated actin assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Termination of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription is a key step that is important for 3′ end formation of functional mRNA, mRNA release, and Pol II recycling. Even so, the underlying termination mechanism is not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved and essential termination factor Seb1 is found on Pol II near the end of the RNA exit channel and the Rpb4/7 stalk. Furthermore, the Seb1 interaction surface with Pol II largely overlaps with that of the elongation factor Spt5. Notably, Seb1 co-transcriptional recruitment is dependent on Spt5 dephosphorylation by the conserved PP1 phosphatase Dis2, which also dephosphorylates threonine 4 within the Pol II heptad repeated C-terminal domain. We propose that Dis2 orchestrates the transition from elongation to termination phase during the transcription cycle by mediating elongation to termination factor exchange and dephosphorylation of Pol II C-terminal domain.

Abstract: Summary
Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a frequently incurable disease associated with the human lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). RNAi screening of ATLL lines revealed that their proliferation depends on BATF3 and IRF4, which cooperatively drive ATLL-specific gene expression. HBZ, the only HTLV-I encoded transcription factor that is expressed in all ATLL cases, binds to an ATLL-specific BATF3 super-enhancer and thereby regulates the expression of BATF3 and its downstream targets, including MYC. Inhibitors of bromodomain-and-extra-terminal-domain (BET) chromatin proteins collapsed the transcriptional network directed by HBZ and BATF3, and were consequently toxic for ATLL cell lines, patient samples, and xenografts. Our study demonstrates that the HTLV-I oncogenic retrovirus exploits a regulatory module that can be attacked therapeutically with BET inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors on postsynaptic membranes is critical for basal neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigated the role of syntaxin 4 in postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 neurons by analyzing conditional knockout (syntaxin 4 cKO) mice. We show that syntaxin 4 cKO resulted in reduction of basal neurotransmission without changes in paired-pulse ratios. Both α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated charge transfers were diminished. Patch-clamp experiments revealed that amplitudes, but not frequencies, of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents are reduced. Syntaxin 4 knockout (KO) caused drastic reduction in expression of surface α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, cKO caused defects in theta-burst stimulation induced long-term potentiation and spatial learning as assessed by a water maze task, indicating that synaptic plasticity was altered. Our data reveal a crucial role of syntaxin 4 in trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are essential for basal neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and spatial memory.

Abstract: Summary
T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is commonly associated with activating mutations in the NOTCH1 pathway. Recent reports have shown a link between NOTCH1 signaling and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in T-ALL. Here, we investigate the role of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) mediated by the Ca2+ channel ORAI1 and its activators STIM1 and STIM2 in T-ALL. Deletion of STIM1 and STIM2 in leukemic cells abolishes SOCE and significantly prolongs the survival of mice in a NOTCH1-dependent model of T-ALL. The survival advantage is unrelated to the leukemic cell burden but is associated with the SOCE-dependent ability of malignant T lymphoblasts to cause inflammation in leukemia-infiltrated organs. Mice with STIM1/STIM2-deficient T-ALL show a markedly reduced necroinflammatory response in leukemia-infiltrated organs and downregulation of signaling pathways previously linked to cancer-induced inflammation. Our study shows that leukemic T lymphoblasts cause inflammation of leukemia-infiltrated organs that is dependent on SOCE.

Abstract: Summary
Complex cell behaviors require dynamic control over non-muscle myosin II (NMMII) regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation. Here, we report that RLC phosphorylation can be tracked in living cells and organisms using a homotransfer fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. Fluorescent protein-tagged RLCs exhibit FRET in the dephosphorylated conformation, permitting identification and quantification of RLC phosphorylation in living cells. This approach is versatile and can accommodate several different fluorescent protein colors, thus enabling multiplexed imaging with complementary biosensors. In fibroblasts, dynamic myosin phosphorylation was observed at the leading edge of migrating cells and retracting structures where it persistently colocalized with activated myosin light chain kinase. Changes in myosin phosphorylation during C. elegans embryonic development were tracked using polarization inverted selective-plane illumination microscopy (piSPIM), revealing a shift in phosphorylated myosin localization to a longitudinal orientation following the onset of twitching. Quantitative analyses further suggested that RLC phosphorylation dynamics occur independently from changes in protein expression.

Abstract: Summary
RNA binding motif protein 10 (RBM10) is a regulator of alternative splicing in apoptosis and inflammation. We discovered a splicing-independent function of RBM10 critical for the regulation of heart failure (HF). RBM10 is enriched in the heart and associates with Star-PAP (TUT1) to control the expression and 3′ end processing of cardiac mRNAs. The RBM10 RRM2 domain binds the Star-PAP catalytic domain, which directs Star-PAP activity toward polyadenylation. RBM10 binds the pre-mRNA UTR, assembles the Star-PAP complex, and guides this complex specifically to mRNAs encoding anti-hypertrophy regulators. Accordingly, we tested cellular hypertrophy in rat cardiomyoblasts and cardiac hypertrophy (CH) and the subsequent progression to HF in Wistar rat hearts. We demonstrated downregulation of RBM10 during CH and HF. Ectopic re-expression of RBM10 rescued cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. RBM10 depletion evoked a hypertrophic response in H9c2 cells. Our results establish an anti-hypertrophy mechanism mediated by RBM10 in the heart that is directly linked to HF.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the pathways guiding the development of definitive hematopoiesis with lymphoid potential is essential for advancing human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technologies for the treatment of blood diseases and immunotherapies. In the embryo, lymphoid progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) arise from hemogenic endothelium (HE) lining arteries but not veins. Here, we show that activation of the arterial program through ETS1 overexpression or by modulating MAPK/ERK signaling pathways at the mesodermal stage of development dramatically enhanced the formation of arterial-type HE expressing DLL4 and CXCR4. Blood cells generated from arterial HE were more than 100-fold enriched in T cell precursor frequency and possessed the capacity to produce B lymphocytes and red blood cells expressing high levels of BCL11a and β-globin. Together, these findings provide an innovative strategy to aid in the generation of definitive lymphomyeloid progenitors and lymphoid cells from hPSCs for immunotherapy through enhancing arterial programming of HE.

Abstract: Summary
In adult tissues and organs with high turnover rates, the generation of transit-amplifying cell (TAC) populations from self-renewing stem cells drives cell replacement. The role of stem cells is to provide a renewable source of cells that give rise to TACs to provide the cell numbers that are necessary for cell differentiation. Regulation of the formation of TACs is thus fundamental to controlling cell replacement. Here, we analyze the properties of a population of mesenchymal TACs in the continuously growing mouse incisor to identify key components of the molecular regulation that drives proliferation. We show that the polycomb repressive complex 1 acts as a global regulator of the TAC phenotype by its direct action on the expression of key cell-cycle regulatory genes and by regulating Wnt/β-catenin-signaling activity. We also identify an essential requirement for TACs in maintaining mesenchymal stem cells, which is indicative of a positive feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Late-phase clinical trials investigating metformin as a cancer therapy are underway. However, there remains controversy as to the mode of action of metformin in tumors at clinical doses. We conducted a clinical study integrating measurement of markers of systemic metabolism, dynamic FDG-PET-CT, transcriptomics, and metabolomics at paired time points to profile the bioactivity of metformin in primary breast cancer. We show metformin reduces the levels of mitochondrial metabolites, activates multiple mitochondrial metabolic pathways, and increases 18-FDG flux in tumors. Two tumor groups are identified with distinct metabolic responses, an OXPHOS transcriptional response (OTR) group for which there is an increase in OXPHOS gene transcription and an FDG response group with increased 18-FDG uptake. Increase in proliferation, as measured by a validated proliferation signature, suggested that patients in the OTR group were resistant to metformin treatment. We conclude that mitochondrial response to metformin in primary breast cancer may define anti-tumor effect.

Abstract: Summary
T helper 17 (Th17) cell development is programmed by the orphan nuclear receptor RORγt, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation depends on coactivators. Here, we show that steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) critically regulates Th17 cell differentiation. Reduced incidence of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) associated with decreased Th17 cell generation in vivo was observed in mice with SRC-3 deletion specifically in T cells. In vitro, SRC-3 deficiency did not affect TGF-β/IL-6-induced Th17 cell generation but severely impaired pathogenic Th17 differentiation induced by IL-1/IL-6/IL-23. Microarray analysis revealed that SRC-3 not only regulates IL-17A but also IL-1R1 expression. SRC-3 bound to Il17a and Il1r1 loci in a RORγt-dependent manner and was required for recruitment of the p300 acetyltransferase. Thus, SRC-3 is critical for RORγt-dependent gene expression in Th17 cell-driven autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Through three-dimensional STORM super-resolution microscopy, we resolve the spectrin-actin-based membrane cytoskeleton of neural stem cells (NSCs) and NSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. We show that undifferentiated NSCs are capable of forming patches of locally periodic, one-dimensional (1D) membrane cytoskeleton with ∼180 nm periodicity. Such periodic structures become increasingly ordered and long-ranging as the NSCs mature into terminally differentiated neuronal and glial cell types, and, during this process, distinct 1D periodic “strips” dominate the flat 2D membranes. Moreover, we report remarkable alignment of the periodic cytoskeletons between abutting cells at axon-axon and axon-oligodendrocyte contacts and identify two adhesion molecules, neurofascin and L1CAM, as candidates to drive this nanoscale alignment. We thus show that a conserved 1D periodic membrane cytoskeletal motif serves as a nanoscale scaffold and ruler to mediate the physical interactions between cell types of the NSC lineage.

Abstract: Summary
The sense of smell influences many behaviors, yet how odors are represented in the brain remains unclear. A major challenge to studying olfaction is the lack of methods allowing activation of specific types of olfactory neurons in an ethologically relevant setting. To address this, we developed a genetic method in Drosophila called olfactogenetics in which a narrowly tuned odorant receptor, Or56a, is ectopically expressed in different olfactory neuron types. Stimulation with geosmin (the only known Or56a ligand) in an Or56a mutant background leads to specific activation of only target olfactory neuron types. We used this approach to identify olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that directly guide oviposition decisions. We identify 5 OSN-types (Or71a, Or47b, Or49a, Or67b, and Or7a) that, when activated alone, suppress oviposition. Projection neurons partnering with these OSNs share a region of innervation in the lateral horn, suggesting that oviposition site selection might be encoded in this brain region.

Abstract: Summary
Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) analogs represent a new class of potential anti-arrhythmic KV7.1 and KV7.1+KCNE1 channel activators. In this study, we describe dual independent activating effects of negatively charged PUFA analogs on KV7.1 and KV7.1+KCNE1 that are dependent on discrete channel motifs. PUFA analogs are critically dependent on K326 in S6 of KV7.1 to increase the maximum conductance and critically dependent on specific S4 arginines in KV7.1 to shift the voltage dependence of channel opening toward negative voltages. Our findings provide insights into how KV7.1+KCNE1 activators may interact electrostatically both with the pore domain and the voltage-sensing domain to augment channel activity. We believe that the molecular understanding of how PUFA analogs induce dual independent activating effects is an important step toward the development of effective anti-arrhythmic drugs that target KV7.1 channels.

Abstract: Summary
Intragenomic conflicts are fueled by rapidly evolving selfish genetic elements, which induce selective pressures to innovate opposing repressive mechanisms. This is patently manifest in sex-ratio (SR) meiotic drive systems, in which distorter and suppressor factors bias and restore equal transmission of X and Y sperm. Here, we reveal that multiple SR suppressors in Drosophila simulans (Nmy and Tmy) encode related hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs), which generate endo-siRNAs that repress the paralogous distorters Dox and MDox. All components in this drive network are recently evolved and largely testis restricted. To connect SR hpRNA function to the RNAi pathway, we generated D. simulans null mutants of Dcr-2 and AGO2. Strikingly, these core RNAi knockouts massively derepress Dox and MDox and are in fact completely male sterile and exhibit highly defective spermatogenesis. Altogether, our data reveal how the adaptive capacity of hpRNAs is critically deployed to restrict selfish gonadal genetic systems that can exterminate a species.

Abstract: Summary
All biological populations are to a greater or lesser degree evolvable, but the forces that shape evolvability, especially the evolution of evolvability as an adaptive response to pressure to evolve rapidly, are a source of controversy. One determinant of evolvability is the set of possible mutations available to a genotype, or “mutational neighborhood.” A benign (instead of deleterious) mutational neighborhood can enhance evolvability. Whether selection for evolvability itself can result in a more benign mutational neighborhood remains an open question. We document the evolution of increased evolvability in a fluctuating environment despite using a regime that precludes, by design, the adaptive evolution of evolvability. Instead, a benign mutational neighborhood arises as a byproduct of transiently elevated error rates via a mechanism that we call emergent evolutionary capacitance. This is evolutionary capacitance similar to that seen in a model system for capacitance, the yeast prion [PSI+], but without a capacitor.

Abstract: Summary
Genes in higher eukaryotes are regulated by long-range interactions, which can determine what combination of genes is expressed in a chromosomal segment. The choice of the genes can display exclusivity, independence, or co-occurrence. We introduced a simple measure to quantify this interdependence in gene expression and differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells to neurons to measure the single-cell expression of the gene isoforms in the protocadherin (Pcdh) cluster, a key component of neuronal diversity. As the neuronal progenitors mature into neurons, expression of the gene isoforms in the Pcdh array is initially concurrent. Even though the number of the expressed genes is increasing during differentiation, the expression shifts toward exclusivity. The expression frequency correlates highly with CTCF binding to the promoters and follows dynamically the changes in the binding during the differentiation. These findings aid in understanding the interplay between cellular differentiation and stochastic gene choice.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperactivating mutations in the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 cause Noonan syndrome (NS). NS is associated with cognitive deficits, but how hyperactivation of SHP2 in NS changes neuron function is not well understood. We find that mice bearing an NS-associated SHP2 allele (NS mice) have selectively impaired Schaffer collateral-CA1 NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission and that residual NMDAR-mediated currents decay faster in NS mice because of reduced contribution of GluN1:GluN2B diheteromers. Consistent with altered GluN2B function, we identify GluN2B Y1252 as an NS-associated SHP2 substrate both in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of Y1252 does not alter recombinant GluN1:GluN2B receptor kinetics. Instead, phospho-Y1252 binds the actin-regulatory adaptor protein Nck2, and this interaction is required for proper NMDAR function. These results establish SHP2 and Nck2 as NMDAR regulatory proteins and strongly suggest that NMDAR dysfunction contributes to NS cognitive deficits.

Abstract: Summary
In response to activation, CD4+ T cells upregulate autophagy. However, the functional consequences of that upregulation have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identify autophagy as a tolerance-avoidance mechanism. Our data show that inhibition of autophagy during CD4+ T cell activation induces a long-lasting state of hypo-responsiveness that is accompanied by the expression of an anergic gene signature. Cells unable to induce autophagy after T cell receptor (TCR) engagement show inefficient mitochondrial respiration and decreased turnover of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN1, which translates into defective TCR-mediated signaling. In vivo, inhibition of autophagy during antigen priming induces T cell anergy and decreases the severity of disease in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model. Interestingly, CD4+ T cells isolated from the synovial fluid of juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients, while resistant to suboptimal stimulation-induced anergy, can be tolerized with autophagy inhibitors. We propose that autophagy constitutes a tolerance-avoidance mechanism, which determines CD4+ T cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Mitosis is induced by the activation of the cyclin B/cdk1 feedback loop that creates a bistable state. The triggering factor promoting active cyclin B/cdk1 switch has been assigned to cyclin B/cdk1 accumulation during G2. However, this complex is rapidly inactivated by Wee1/Myt1-dependent phosphorylation of cdk1 making unlikely a triggering role of this kinase in mitotic commitment. Here we show that cyclin A/cdk1 kinase is the factor triggering mitosis. Cyclin A/cdk1 phosphorylates Bora to promote Aurora A-dependent Plk1 phosphorylation and activation and mitotic entry. We demonstrate that Bora phosphorylation by cyclin A/cdk1 is both necessary and sufficient for mitotic commitment. Finally, we identify a site in Bora whose phosphorylation by cyclin A/cdk1 is required for mitotic entry. We constructed a mathematical model confirming the essential role of this kinase in mitotic commitment. Overall, our results uncover the molecular mechanism by which cyclin A/cdk1 triggers mitotic entry.

Abstract: Summary
Maternally skewed transmission of traits has been associated with genomic imprinting and oocyte-derived mRNA. We report canine congenital eye malformations, caused by an amino acid deletion (K12del) near the N terminus of retinol-binding protein (RBP4). The disease is only expressed when both dam and offspring are deletion homozygotes. RBP carries vitamin A (retinol) from hepatic stores to peripheral tissues, including the placenta and developing eye, where it is required to synthesize retinoic acid. Gestational vitamin A deficiency is a known risk factor for ocular birth defects. The K12del mutation disrupts RBP folding in vivo, decreasing its secretion from hepatocytes to serum. The maternal penetrance effect arises from an impairment in the sequential transfer of retinol across the placenta, via RBP encoded by maternal and fetal genomes. Our results demonstrate a mode of recessive maternal inheritance, with a physiological basis, and they extend previous observations on dominant-negative RBP4 alleles in humans.

Abstract: Summary
In the developing spinal cord, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) attracts commissural axons toward the floorplate. How Shh regulates the cytoskeletal remodeling that underlies growth cone turning is unknown. We found that Shh-mediated growth cone turning requires the activity of Docks, which are unconventional GEFs. Knockdown of Dock3 and 4, or their binding partner ELMO1 and 2, abolished commissural axon attraction by Shh in vitro. Dock3/4 and ELMO1/2 were also required for correct commissural axon guidance in vivo. Polarized Dock activity was sufficient to induce axon turning, indicating that Docks are instructive for axon guidance. Mechanistically, we show that Dock and ELMO interact with Boc, the Shh receptor, and that this interaction is reduced upon Shh stimulation. Furthermore, Shh stimulation translocates ELMO to the growth cone periphery and activates Rac1. This identifies Dock/ELMO as an effector complex of non-canonical Shh signaling and demonstrates the instructive role of GEFs in axon guidance.

Abstract: The bacterial cell wall is in part composed of the peptidoglycan (PG) layer that maintains the cell shape and sustains the basic cellular processes of growth and division. The cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria also carries teichoic acids (TAs). In this work, we investigated how TAs contribute to the structuration of the PG network through the modulation of PG hydrolytic enzymes in the context of the Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium. Pneumococcal TAs are decorated by phosphorylcholine residues which serve as anchors for the Choline-Binding Proteins, some of them acting as PG hydrolases, like the major autolysin LytA. Their binding is non covalent and reversible, a property that allows easy manipulation of the system. In this work, we show that the release of LytA occurs independently from its amidase activity. Furthermore, LytA fused to GFP was expressed in pneumococcal cells and showed different localization patterns according to the growth phase. Importantly, we demonstrate that TAs modulate the enzymatic activity of LytA since a low level of TAs present at the cell surface triggers LytA sensitivity in growing pneumococcal cells. We previously developed a method to label nascent TAs in live cells revealing that the insertion of TAs into the cell wall occurs at the mid-cell. In conclusion, we demonstrate that nascent TAs inserted in the cell wall at the division site are the specific receptors of LytA, tuning in this way the positioning of LytA at the appropriate place at the cell surface.

Abstract: Summary
Virulent pathogens often cause the release of host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from infected cells. During encounters with immune-evasive viruses that block inflammatory gene expression, preformed DAMPs provide backup inflammatory signals that ensure protective immunity. Whether DAMPs exhibit additional backup defense activities is unknown. Herein, we report that viral infection of barrier epithelia (keratinocytes) elicits the release of preformed interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines, including the DAMP IL-1α. Mechanistic studies revealed that IL-1 acts on skin fibroblasts to induce an interferon (IFN)-like state that restricts viral replication. We identified a branch in the IL-1 signaling pathway that induces IFN-stimulated gene expression in infected cells and found that IL-1 signaling is necessary to restrict viral replication in human skin explants. These activities are most important to control immune-evasive virus replication in fibroblasts and other barrier cell types. These findings highlight IL-1 as an important backup antiviral system to ensure barrier defense.

Abstract: Summary
Healthy renal function depends on normal nephrogenesis during embryonic development. However, a comprehensive gene expression profile of human fetal kidney development remains largely unexplored. Here, using a single-cell RNA-sequencing technique, we analyzed >3,000 human fetal renal cells spanning 4 months of development in utero. Unsupervised analysis identified two progenitor subtypes during cap mesenchyme development, suggesting a mechanism for sustaining their progenitor states. Furthermore, we identified critical transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways involved in the segmentation of nephron tubules. We explored the development of the highly heterogeneous collecting duct epithelia and dissected the metabolic gene repertoire and the extracellular matrix composition of the glomerular mesangium. The results provide insights on the molecular basis and regulatory events in human renal development. Moreover, the cell-type-specific expression features of causal genes in congenital renal diseases may be helpful in the treatment of these diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental neuronal remodeling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism required for precise wiring of nervous systems. Despite its fundamental role in neurodevelopment and proposed contribution to various neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we uncover the fine temporal transcriptional landscape of Drosophila mushroom body γ neurons undergoing stereotypical remodeling. Our data reveal rapid and dramatic changes in the transcriptional landscape during development. Focusing on DNA binding proteins, we identify eleven that are required for remodeling. Furthermore, we sequence developing γ neurons perturbed for three key transcription factors required for pruning. We describe a hierarchical network featuring positive and negative feedback loops. Superimposing the perturbation-seq on the developmental expression atlas highlights a framework of transcriptional modules that together drive remodeling. Overall, this study provides a broad and detailed molecular insight into the complex regulatory dynamics of developmental remodeling and thus offers a pipeline to dissect developmental processes via RNA profiling.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian sex determination depends on a complex interplay of signals that promote the bipotential fetal gonad to develop as either a testis or an ovary, but the details are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether removal of the signaling molecule retinoic acid (RA) by the degradative enzyme CYP26B1 is necessary for proper development of somatic cells of the testes. Gonadal organ culture experiments suggested that RA promotes expression of some ovarian markers and suppresses expression of some testicular markers, acting downstream of Sox9. XY Cyp26b1-null embryos, in which endogenous RA is not degraded, develop mild ovotestes, but more important, steroidogenesis is impaired and the reproductive tract feminized. Experiments involving purified gonadal cells showed that these effects are independent of germ cells and suggest the direct involvement of the orphan nuclear receptor DAX1. Our results reveal that active removal of endogenous RA is required for normal testis development in the mouse.

Abstract: Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) constitute the major cell population in heart valves. Quiescent fibroblastic VICs are seen in adult healthy valves. They become activated myofibroblastic VICs during development, in diseased valves and in vitro. 2D substrate stiffness within a 5–15 kPa range along with high passage numbers promote VIC activation in vitro. In this study, we characterize VIC quiescence and activation across a 1–21 kPa range of substrate stiffness and passages. We define a cell morphology characterization system for VICs as they transform. We hypothesize that VICs show distinct morphological characteristics in different activation states and the morphology distribution varies with substrate stiffness and passage number. Four VIC morphologies - tailed, spindle, rhomboid and triangle - account for the majority of VIC in this study. Using α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), non-muscle myosin heavy chain B (SMemb) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) as activation markers for validation, we developed a system where we categorize morphology distribution of VIC cultures, to be potentially used as a non-destructive detection method of activation state. We also show that this system can be used to force stiffness-induced deactivation. The reversibility in VIC activation has important implications in in vitro research and tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Selective block of NaV1.7 promises to produce non-narcotic analgesic activity without motor or cognitive impairment. Several NaV1.7-selective blockers have been reported, but efficacy in animal pain models required high multiples of the IC50 for channel block. Here, we report a target engagement assay using transgenic mice that has enabled the development of a second generation of selective Nav1.7 inhibitors that show robust analgesic activity in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models at low multiples of the IC50. Like earlier arylsulfonamides, these newer acylsulfonamides target a binding site on the surface of voltage sensor domain 4 to achieve high selectivity among sodium channel isoforms and steeply state-dependent block. The improved efficacy correlates with very slow dissociation from the target channel. Chronic dosing increases compound potency about 10-fold, possibly due to reversal of sensitization arising during chronic injury, and provides efficacy that persists long after the compound has cleared from plasma.

Abstract: Summary
RIG-I has a remarkable ability to specifically select viral 5′ppp dsRNAs for activation from a pool of cytosolic self-RNAs. The ATPase activity of RIG-I plays a role in RNA discrimination and activation, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Using transient-state kinetics, we elucidated the ATPase-driven “kinetic proofreading” mechanism of RIG-I activation and RNA discrimination, akin to DNA polymerases, ribosomes, and T cell receptors. Even in the autoinhibited state of RIG-I, the C-terminal domain kinetically discriminates against self-RNAs by fast off rates. ATP binding facilitates dsRNA engagement but, interestingly, makes RIG-I promiscuous, explaining the constitutive signaling by Singleton-Merten syndrome-linked mutants that bind ATP without hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis dissociates self-RNAs faster than 5′ppp dsRNA but, more importantly, drives RIG-I oligomerization through translocation, which we show to be regulated by helicase motif IVa. RIG-I translocates directionally from the dsRNA end into the stem region, and the 5′ppp end “throttles” translocation to provide a mechanism for threading and building a signaling-active oligomeric complex.

Abstract: Summary
Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer growth, forming the conceptual basis for development of metabolic therapies as cancer treatments. We performed in vivo metabolic profiling and molecular analysis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to identify metabolic nodes for therapeutic targeting. Lung SCCs adapt to chronic mTOR inhibition and suppression of glycolysis through the GSK3α/β signaling pathway, which upregulates glutaminolysis. Phospho-GSK3α/β protein levels are predictive of response to single-therapy mTOR inhibition while combinatorial treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 effectively overcomes therapy resistance. In addition, we identified a conserved metabolic signature in a broad spectrum of hypermetabolic human tumors that may be predictive of patient outcome and response to combined metabolic therapies targeting mTOR and glutaminase.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in BLM helicase predispose Bloom syndrome (BS) patients to a wide spectrum of cancers. We demonstrate that MIB1-ubiquitylated BLM in G1 phase functions as an adaptor protein by enhancing the binding of transcription factor c-Jun and its E3 ligase, Fbw7α. BLM enhances the K48/K63-linked ubiquitylation on c-Jun, thereby enhancing the rate of its subsequent degradation. Functionally defective Fbw7α mutants prevalent in multiple human cancers are reactivated by BLM. However, BS patient-derived BLM mutants cannot potentiate Fbw7α-dependent c-Jun degradation. The decrease in the levels of c-Jun in cells expressing BLM prevents effective c-Jun binding to 2,584 gene promoters. This causes decreases in the transcript and protein levels of c-Jun targets in BLM-expressing cells, resulting in attenuated c-Jun-dependent effects during neoplastic transformation. Thus, BLM carries out its function as a tumor suppressor by enhancing c-Jun turnover and thereby preventing its activity as a proto-oncogene.

Abstract: Summary
The stereociliary bundles of cochlear hair cells convert mechanical vibrations into the electrical signals required for auditory sensation. While the stiffness of the bundles strongly influences mechanotransduction, its influence on the vibratory response of the cochlear partition is unclear. To assess this, we measured cochlear vibrations in mutant mice with reduced bundle stiffness or with a tectorial membrane (TM) that is detached from the sensory epithelium. We found that reducing bundle stiffness decreased the high-frequency extent and sharpened the tuning of vibratory responses obtained postmortem. Detaching the TM further reduced the high-frequency extent of the vibrations but also lowered the partition’s resonant frequency. Together, these results demonstrate that the bundle’s stiffness and attachment to the TM contribute to passive longitudinal coupling in the cochlea. We conclude that the stereociliary bundles and TM interact to facilitate passive-wave propagation to more apical locations, possibly enhancing active-wave amplification in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral nerve lesions provoke apoptosis in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The cause of cell death, the involvement of neurons, and the relevance for the processing of somatosensory information are controversial. Here, we demonstrate in a mouse model of sciatic nerve injury that glutamate-induced neurodegeneration and loss of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons in the superficial dorsal horn promote the transition from acute to chronic neuropathic pain. Conditional deletion of Grin1, the essential subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), protects dorsal horn neurons from excitotoxicity and preserves GABAergic inhibition. Mice deficient in functional NMDARs exhibit normal nociceptive responses and acute pain after nerve injury, but this initial increase in pain sensitivity is reversible. Eliminating NMDARs fully prevents persistent pain-like behavior. Reduced pain in mice lacking proapoptotic Bax confirmed the significance of neurodegeneration. We conclude that NMDAR-mediated neuron death contributes to the development of chronic neuropathic pain.

Abstract: Summary
The extensive subcellular network of membrane contact sites plays central roles in organelle biogenesis and communication, yet the precise contributions of the involved machineries remain largely enigmatic. The yeast vacuole forms a membrane contact site with mitochondria, called vacuolar and mitochondrial patch (vCLAMP). Formation of vCLAMPs involves the vacuolar Rab GTPase Ypt7 and the Ypt7-interacting Vps39 subunit of the HOPS tethering complex. Here, we uncover the general preprotein translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) subunit Tom40 as the direct binding partner of Vps39 on mitochondria. We identify Vps39 mutants defective in TOM binding, but functional for HOPS. Cells that cannot form vCLAMPs show reduced growth under stress conditions and impaired survival upon starvation. Unexpectedly, our mutant analysis revealed the existence of two functionally independent vacuole-mitochondria MCSs: one formed by the Ypt7-Vps39-Tom40 tether and a second one by Vps13-Mcp1, which is redundant with ER-mitochondrial contacts formed by ERMES.

Abstract: Tumour metastasis is one of the most serious challenges of cancer as it is the major cause of mortality in patients with solid tumours, including osteosarcoma (OS). In this regard, anti-metastatic genes have potential for metastasis inhibition strategies. Recent evidence showed the importance of breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) in control of OS invasiveness, but the regulation of BRMS1 in OS remains largely unknown. Here, we used bioinformatics analyses to predict BRMS1-targeting microRNAs (miRNAs), and the functional binding of miRNAs to BRMS1 mRNA was evaluated using a dual luciferase reporter assay. Among all BRMS1-targeting miRNAs, only miR-151b, miR-7-5p and miR-3200-5p showed significant expression in OS specimens. Specifically, we found that only miR-3200-5p significantly inhibited protein translation of BRMS1 via pairing to the 3′-UTR of the BRMS1 mRNA. Moreover, we detected significantly lower BRMS1 and significantly higher miR-3200-5p in the OS specimens compared to the paired adjacent non-tumour bone tissues. Furthermore, BRMS1 and miR-3200-5p levels were inversely correlated to each other. Low BRMS1 was correlated with metastasis and poor patient survival. In vitro, overexpression of miR-3200-5p significantly decreased BRMS1 levels and promoted OS cell invasion and migration, while depletion of miR-3200-5p significantly increased BRMS1 levels and inhibited OS cell invasion and migration. Thus, our study revealed that miR-3200-5p may be a critical regulator of OS cell invasiveness.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamic instability of microtubules is a conserved and fundamental mechanism in eukaryotes. Yet microtubules from different species diverge in their growth rates, lattice structures, and responses to GTP hydrolysis. Therefore, we do not know what limits microtubule growth, what determines microtubule structure, or whether the mechanisms of dynamic instability are universal. Here, we studied microtubules from the nematode C. elegans, which have strikingly fast growth rates and non-canonical lattices in vivo. Using a reconstitution approach, we discovered that C. elegans microtubules combine intrinsically fast growth with very frequent catastrophes. We solved the structure of C. elegans microtubules to 4.8 Å and discovered sequence divergence in the lateral contact loops, one of which is ordered in C. elegans but unresolved in other species. We provide direct evidence that C. elegans tubulin has a higher free energy in solution and propose a model wherein the ordering of lateral contact loops activates tubulin for growth.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells entail metabolic adaptation and microenvironmental remodeling to survive and progress. Both calcium (Ca2+) flux and Ca2+-dependent signaling play a crucial role in this process, although the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. Through RNA screening, we identified one long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) named CamK-A (lncRNA for calcium-dependent kinase activation) in tumorigenesis. CamK-A is highly expressed in multiple human cancers and involved in cancer microenvironment remodeling via activation of Ca2+-triggered signaling. Mechanistically, CamK-A activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase PNCK, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα and triggers calcium-dependent nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. This regulation results in the tumor microenvironment remodeling, including macrophage recruitment, angiogenesis, and tumor progression. Notably, our human-patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model studies demonstrate that targeting CamK-A robustly impaired cancer development. Clinically, CamK-A expression coordinates with the activation of CaMK-NF-κB axis, and its high expression indicates poor patient survival rate, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

Abstract: The role of vascular gap junctions in the conduction of intercellular Ca2+ and vasoconstriction along small resistance arteries is not entirely understood. Some depolarizing agents trigger conducted vasoconstriction while others only evoke a local depolarization. Here we use a novel technique to investigate the temporal and spatial relationship between intercellular Ca2+ signals generated by smooth muscle action potentials (APs) and vasoconstriction in mesenteric resistance arteries (MA). Pulses of exogenous KCl to depolarize the downstream end (T1) of a 3 mm long artery increased intracellular Ca2+ associated with vasoconstriction. The spatial spread and amplitude of both depended on the duration of the pulse, with only a restricted non-conducting vasoconstriction to a 1 s pulse. While blocking smooth muscle cell (SMC) K+ channels with TEA and activating L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) with BayK 8644 spread was dramatically facilitated, so the 1 s pulse evoked intercellular Ca2+ waves and vasoconstriction that spread along an entire artery segment 3000 μm long. Ca2+ waves spread as nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+ spikes due to SMC action potentials, and evoked vasoconstriction. Both intercellular Ca2+ and vasoconstriction spread at circa 3 mm s−1 and were independent of the endothelium. The spread but not the generation of Ca2+ spikes was reversibly blocked by the gap junction inhibitor 18β-GA. Thus, smooth muscle gap junctions enable depolarization to spread along resistance arteries, and once regenerative Ca2+-based APs occur, spread along the entire length of an artery followed by widespread vasoconstriction.

Abstract: Summary
It is well established that fibrotic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment favors tumorigenesis, but whether fibrosis underlies malignant progression in other ways is unclear. Here, we report that adaptive myofibroblastic reprogramming of osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) results in a critical advantage when establishing lung macro-metastases and spheroid growth but does not affect the growth of primary lesions or monolayer cultures. FGFR2 signaling in OSCs initiates fibrosis, whereas the resultant fibronectin (FN) auto-deposition sustains fibrogenic reprogramming and OSC growth, resembling the process employed by non-malignant myofibroblasts to cause tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that nintedanib targets the pan FGFR-FN axis to disrupt lung metastasis without affecting the bone lesion growth of OSCs. Thus, myofibroblastic reprogramming of human OSCs in the lungs might represent a druggable trait for treating a deadly metastatic complication.

Abstract: Alterations of Endothelial cells (ECs) play a critical role in different pathogenesis of many serious human diseases, and dysfunction of the vascular endothelium is an indicator for human disorders. Endothelial dysfunction is considered to be an early indicator for atherosclerosis, which is characterised by overexpression of adhesion molecules, including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) released via neutrophils is an important mediator of endothelial cell function. Ambient production of superoxide anion (O2−) and subsequently H2O2 at low levels is critical for regulating endothelial cell functions and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of H2O2 on the expression of adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Intracellular superoxide anion production was detected by using p-Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NBT) assay. Our results showed that administration of 100μM of H2O2 on HUVECs for 2, 6, 12 and 24 h induced a time-dependent increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA and protein expression levels with a significant increase observed from 6 h. HUVECs exposed to H2O2 exhibit increased O2−, suggesting that H2O2 induced oxidative stress may be a reasonable for atherosclerosis. This increase can be reduced by the flavonoid, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). The modulation of endothelial cell function through this mechanism may underlie the contribution of H2O2 to the development of vascular disease.

Abstract: Pleomorphic liposarcoma (PLPS) is a heterogeneous resistant group of tumors. Complete surgical resection is the only known way to treat PLPS. PLPS is reristant to both radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, precise individualized therapy is needed to improve outcome of advanced PLPS patients. In this study, a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of a PDGFRA-amplified PLPS was established in the biceps femoris of nude mice by surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI) in order to match the patient. The PLPS PDOX was treated with pazopanib (PAZ) which targets PDGFRA, as well as with temozolomide (TEM) and first-line therapy doxorubicin (DOX). The PLPS PDOX was resistant to DOX and responded very well to PAZ as well as TEM. The tumor volume on treatment day-14 relative to day-1 was as follows: DOX (4.50 ± 2.6, p = 0.8087); PAZ (1.29 ± 0.9, p = 0.0008 compared to the control, p = 0.0167 compared to DOX); TEM (1.07 ± 0.8, p = 0.0079 compared to the control, p = 0.0079 compared to DOX). There was no significant difference in body weight between any treated group or control. The PAZ- and TEM-treated tumors showed extensive necrosis compared to the DOX-treated and untreated PDOX tumors. The present study showed that PDGFRA amplification could be effectively targeted by PAZ. The PLPS PDOX model also identified the efficacy of TEM which does not target PDGFRA, indicating that the PDOX model can identify effective targeted therapy as well as standard therapy and at the same time, identify ineffective drugs, even if they are first-line.

Abstract: Summary
Rhinovirus is a leading cause of acute respiratory infections and asthma attacks, but infections are also frequently cleared from the nasal mucosa without causing symptoms. We sought to better understand host defense against rhinovirus by investigating antiviral defense in primary human nasal and bronchial airway epithelial cells cultured ex vivo. Surprisingly, upon rhinovirus infection or RIG-I stimulation, nasal-derived epithelial cells exhibited much more robust antiviral responses than bronchial-derived cells. Conversely, RIG-I stimulation triggered more robust activation of the NRF2-dependent oxidative stress response in bronchial cells compared to nasal cells. NRF2 activation dampened epithelial antiviral responses, whereas NRF2 knockdown enhanced antiviral responses and was protective during rhinovirus infection. These findings demonstrate a tradeoff in epithelial defense against distinct types of airway damage, namely, viral versus oxidative, and reveal differential calibration of defense responses in cells derived from different airway microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
N-terminal acetylation is a major posttranslational modification in eukaryotes catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), NatA through NatF. Although N-terminal acetylation modulates diverse protein functions, little is known about its roles in virus replication. We found that NatB, which comprises NAA20 and NAA25, is involved in the shutoff activity of influenza virus PA-X. The shutoff activity of PA-X was suppressed in NatB-deficient cells, and PA-X mutants that are not acetylated by NatB showed reduced shutoff activities. We also evaluated the importance of N-terminal acetylation of PA, because PA-X shares its N-terminal sequence with PA. Viral polymerase activity was reduced in NatB-deficient cells. Moreover, mutant PAs that are not acetylated by NatB lost their function in the viral polymerase complex. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation is required for the shutoff activity of PA-X and for viral polymerase activity.

Abstract: The morphological and cytological changes of oogenesis and ovarian development were described in the freshwater crab Sinopotamon henanense through macroscopic and microscopic examinations. Serial histological dissections of the ovaries demonstrated that oocyte development was asynchronous. Oogenesis was divided into four distinct stages including six phases: oogonium stage, the first phase (OI) and the second phase (OII) comprising the previtellogenic stage, the third phase (OIII), the fourth phase (OIV) and the fifth phase (OV), comprising the vitellogenic stage and the sixth phase representing the mature stage. Furthermore, examining and analyzing the gonadosomatic indices showed that the developmental cycle of the ovary was closely related to season, and indicated that the breeding season of S. henanense was between May and June. Ovarian development was classified into six stages: proliferation stage, small growth stage, large growth stage, pre-maturation stage, mature stage and spawning stage. Ovaries varied in size and color during each developmental stage, which were closely related to the status and proportions of oogonia and primary oocytes. Although there were cases that oocytes at two or more phases were present at each stage, ovary developmental stages were substantially different. These results provide an important base for studies of the regulatory mechanisms of oogenesis in this compared to other brachyuran species, and will be useful for the aquaculture of S. henanense and related species.

Abstract: Summary
Although CD8+ T-cell-mediated autoimmune β cell destruction occurs in type 1 diabetes (T1D), the target epitopes processed and presented by β cells are unknown. To identify them, we combined peptidomics and transcriptomics strategies. Inflammatory cytokines increased peptide presentation in vitro, paralleling upregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression. Peptide sources featured several insulin granule proteins and all known β cell antigens, barring islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein. Preproinsulin yielded HLA-A2-restricted epitopes previously described. Secretogranin V and its mRNA splice isoform SCG5-009, proconvertase-2, urocortin-3, the insulin gene enhancer protein ISL-1, and an islet amyloid polypeptide transpeptidation product emerged as antigens processed into HLA-A2-restricted epitopes, which, as those already described, were recognized by circulating naive CD8+ T cells in T1D and healthy donors and by pancreas-infiltrating cells in T1D donors. This peptidome opens new avenues to understand antigen processing by β cells and for the development of T cell biomarkers and tolerogenic vaccination strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the comprehensive knowledge on odor coding, our understanding of the relationship between sensory input and behavioral output in Drosophila remains weak. Here, we measure the behavioral responses generated by larval and adult flies in response to 34 fruit odors and find that larval preference for fruit odors differs from that of adult flies. Next, we provide a functional analysis of the full repertoire of the peripheral olfactory system using the same comprehensive stimulus spectrum. We find that 90% and 53% of larval and adult olfactory receptors tested here, respectively, are involved in evaluating these fruit odors. Finally, we find that the total amount of olfactory neuronal activity correlates strongly positively with behavioral output in larvae and correlates weakly negatively in adult flies. Our results suggest that larval and adult flies have evolved different mechanisms for detection and computation of fruit odors, mechanisms likely mirroring the different lifestyles of both developmental stages.

Abstract: Summary
The Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial reported return and persistence of non-diabetic blood glucose control in 46% of people with type 2 diabetes of up to 6 years duration. Detailed metabolic studies were performed on a subgroup (intervention, n = 64; control, n = 26). In the intervention group, liver fat content decreased (16.0% ± 1.3% to 3.1% ± 0.5%, p < 0.0001) immediately after weight loss. Similarly, plasma triglyceride and pancreas fat content decreased whether or not glucose control normalized. Recovery of first-phase insulin response (0.04[−0.05–0.32] to 0.11[0.0005–0.51] nmol/min/m2, p < 0.0001) defined those who returned to non-diabetic glucose control and this was durable at 12 months (0.11[0.005–0.81] nmol/min/m2, p = 0.0001). Responders were similar to non-responders at baseline but had shorter diabetes duration (2.7 ± 0.3 versus 3.8 ± 0.4 years; p = 0.02). This study demonstrates that β cell ability to recover long-term function persists after diagnosis, changing the previous paradigm of irreversible loss of β cell function in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are valuable for both basic research and clinical application. We previously reported a chemical cocktail that could reprogram somatic cells into neural progenitor cells. However, the reprogramming process is complex, and the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive. Here, we identified a culture condition that greatly promotes the efficiency of NSC generation directly from mouse fibroblasts based on our reported chemical cocktail. Transcriptome and epigenome analyses demonstrated that growth factors including IL-6, FGF5, and LIF were dynamically activated and contributed to the cell fate changes. Treatment of these growth factors together can enable fibroblast to neural progenitor-like cell conversion. Moreover, the reprogramming capacity of both chemical cocktail and growth factors requires nucleoporin Nup210 to activate SoxB1 transcription factors to initiate NSC fate. Altogether, our findings reveal important roles of both extracellular signals and internal factors in direct cellular reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
The endoribonuclease RNase E is a principal factor in RNA turnover and processing that helps to exercise fine control of gene expression in bacteria. While its catalytic activity can be strongly influenced by the chemical identity of the 5′ end of RNA substrates, the enzyme can also cleave numerous substrates irrespective of the chemistry of their 5′ ends through a mechanism that has remained largely unexplained. We report structural and functional data illuminating details of both operational modes. Our crystal structure of RNase E in complex with the sRNA RprA reveals a duplex recognition site that saddles an inter-protomer surface to help present substrates for cleavage. Our data also reveal an autoinhibitory pocket that modulates the overall activity of the ribonuclease. Taking these findings together, we propose how RNase E uses versatile modes of RNA recognition to achieve optimal activity and specificity.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear protein in testis (Nut) is a universal oncogenic driver in the highly aggressive NUT midline carcinoma, whose physiological function in male germ cells has been unclear. Here we show that expression of Nut is normally restricted to post-meiotic spermatogenic cells, where its presence triggers p300-dependent genome-wide histone H4 hyperacetylation, which is essential for the completion of histone-to-protamine exchange. Accordingly, the inactivation of Nut induces male sterility with spermatogenesis arrest at the histone-removal stage. Nut uses p300 and/or CBP to enhance acetylation of H4 at both K5 and K8, providing binding sites for the first bromodomain of Brdt, the testis-specific member of the BET family, which subsequently mediates genome-wide histone removal. Altogether, our data reveal the detailed molecular basis of the global histone hyperacetylation wave, which occurs before the final compaction of the male genome.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 is a powerful tool for genome editing. Little is known about the kinetics and fidelity of the double-strand break (DSB) repair process that follows a Cas9 cutting event in living cells. Here, we developed a strategy to measure the kinetics of DSB repair for single loci in human cells. Quantitative modeling of repaired DNA in time series after Cas9 activation reveals variable and often slow repair rates, with half-life times up to ∼10 hr. Furthermore, repair of the DSBs tends to be error prone. Both classical and microhomology-mediated end joining pathways contribute to the erroneous repair. Estimation of their individual rate constants indicates that the balance between these two pathways changes over time and can be altered by additional ionizing radiation. Our approach provides quantitative insights into DSB repair kinetics and fidelity in single loci and indicates that Cas9-induced DSBs are repaired in an unusual manner.

Abstract: Summary
Liver tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells migrate throughout the sinusoids and are capable of protecting against malaria sporozoite challenge. To gain an understanding of liver Trm cell development, we examined various conditions for their formation. Although liver Trm cells were found in naive mice, their presence was dictated by antigen specificity and required IL-15. Liver Trm cells also formed after adoptive transfer of in vitro-activated but not naive CD8+ T cells, indicating that activation was essential but that antigen presentation within the liver was not obligatory. These Trm cells patrolled the liver sinusoids with a half-life of 36 days and occupied a large niche that could be added to sequentially without effect on subsequent Trm cell cohorts. Together, our findings indicate that liver Trm cells form as a normal consequence of CD8+ T cell activation during essentially any infection but that inflammatory and antigenic signals preferentially tailor their development.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian sphingolipids, primarily with C24 or C16 acyl chains, reside in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Curiously, little is known how C24 sphingolipids impact cholesterol and membrane microdomains. Here, we present evidence that C24 sphingomyelin, when placed in the outer leaflet, suppresses microdomains in giant unilamellar vesicles and also suppresses submicron domains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. Free energy calculations suggested that cholesterol has a preference for the inner leaflet if C24 sphingomyelin is in the outer leaflet. We indeed observe that cholesterol enriches in the inner leaflet (80%) if C24 sphingomyelin is in the outer leaflet. Similarly, cholesterol primarily resides in the cytoplasmic leaflet (80%) in the plasma membrane of human erythrocytes where C24 sphingolipids are naturally abundant in the outer leaflet. We conclude that C24 sphingomyelin uniquely interacts with cholesterol and regulates the lateral organization in asymmetric membranes, potentially by generating cholesterol asymmetry.

Abstract: Summary
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) endows carcinoma cells with traits needed to complete many of the steps leading to metastasis formation, but its contributions specifically to the late step of extravasation remain understudied. We find that breast cancer cells that have undergone an EMT extravasate more efficiently from blood vessels both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of gene expression changes associated with the EMT program led to the identification of an EMT-induced cell-surface protein, podocalyxin (PODXL), as a key mediator of extravasation in mesenchymal breast and pancreatic carcinoma cells. PODXL promotes extravasation through direct interaction of its intracellular domain with the cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin. Ezrin proceeds to establish dorsal cortical polarity, enabling the transition of cancer cells from a non-polarized, rounded cell morphology to an invasive extravasation-competent shape. Hence, the EMT program can directly enhance the efficiency of extravasation and subsequent metastasis formation through a PODXL-ezrin signaling axis.

Abstract: Summary
Activation and recruitment of thermogenic cells in human white adipose tissues (“browning”) can counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders. However, quantifying the effects of therapeutic interventions on browning remains enigmatic. Here, we devise a computational tool, named ProFAT (profiling of fat tissue types), for quantifying the thermogenic potential of heterogeneous fat biopsies based on prediction of white and brown adipocyte content from raw gene expression datasets. ProFAT systematically integrates 103 mouse-fat-derived transcriptomes to identify unbiased and robust gene signatures of brown and white adipocytes. We validate ProFAT on 80 mouse and 97 human transcriptional profiles from 14 independent studies and correctly predict browning capacity upon various physiological and pharmacological stimuli. Our study represents the most exhaustive comparative analysis of public data on adipose biology toward quantification of browning after personalized medical intervention. ProFAT is freely available and should become increasingly powerful with the growing wealth of transcriptomics data.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has proven clinically beneficial against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However, suboptimal clinical outcomes have been associated with decreased expansion and persistence of adoptively transferred CAR T cells, antigen-negative relapses, and impairment by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Improvements in CAR T cell design are required to enhance clinical efficacy, as well as broaden the applicability of this technology. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-18 (IL-18)-secreting CAR T cells exhibit enhanced in vivo expansion and persistence and significantly increase long-term survival in syngeneic mouse models of both hematological and solid malignancies. In addition, we demonstrate that IL-18-secreting CAR T cells are capable of modulating the tumor microenvironment, as well as enhancing an effective endogenous anti-tumor immune response. IL-18-secreting CAR T cells represent a promising strategy to enhance the clinical outcomes of adoptive T cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic disorder has been suggested to underlie Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the decisive molecular linkages remain unclear. We discovered that human Molybdopterin Synthase Associating Complex, MPTAC, promotes sulfur amino acid catabolism to prevent oxidative damage from excess sulfur amino acids, which, in turn, advances fatty acid oxidation and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthesis. The association of MPTAC with Protein arginine (R) Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) complex and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (SNRP) splicing factors enables SNRPs to sense metabolic states through their methylation. This promotes the splicing fidelity of amyloid precursor protein (APP) pre-mRNA and proper APP fragmentation, abnormalities of which have been observed in the platelets of AD patients. The functions of MPTAC are crucial to maintain expression of drebrin 1, which is required for synaptic plasticity, through prevention from oxidative damage. Thus, adjustment of sulfur amino acid catabolism by MPTAC prevents events that occur early in the onset of AD.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing interest in therapeutically exploiting metabolic differences between normal and cancer cells. We show that kinase inhibitors (KIs) and biguanides synergistically and selectively target a variety of cancer cells. Synthesis of non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) aspartate, asparagine, and serine, as well as glutamine metabolism, are major determinants of the efficacy of KI/biguanide combinations. The mTORC1/4E-BP axis regulates aspartate, asparagine, and serine synthesis by modulating mRNA translation, while ablation of 4E-BP1/2 substantially decreases sensitivity of breast cancer and melanoma cells to KI/biguanide combinations. Efficacy of the KI/biguanide combinations is also determined by HIF-1α-dependent perturbations in glutamine metabolism, which were observed in VHL-deficient renal cancer cells. This suggests that cancer cells display metabolic plasticity by engaging non-redundant adaptive mechanisms, which allows them to survive therapeutic insults that target cancer metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreas development involves a coordinated process in which an early phase of cell segregation is followed by a longer phase of lineage restriction, expansion, and tissue remodeling. By combining clonal tracing and whole-mount reconstruction with proliferation kinetics and single-cell transcriptional profiling, we define the functional basis of pancreas morphogenesis. We show that the large-scale organization of mouse pancreas can be traced to the activity of self-renewing precursors positioned at the termini of growing ducts, which act collectively to drive serial rounds of stochastic ductal bifurcation balanced by termination. During this phase of branching morphogenesis, multipotent precursors become progressively fate-restricted, giving rise to self-renewing acinar-committed precursors that are conveyed with growing ducts, as well as ductal progenitors that expand the trailing ducts and give rise to delaminating endocrine cells. These findings define quantitatively how the functional behavior and lineage progression of precursor pools determine the large-scale patterning of pancreatic sub-compartments.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of epigenetic integrity relies on coordinated recycling and partitioning of parental histones and deposition of newly synthesized histones during DNA replication. This process depends upon a poorly characterized network of histone chaperones, remodelers, and binding proteins. Here we implicate the POLE3-POLE4 subcomplex of the leading-strand polymerase, Polε, in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly through its ability to selectively bind to histones H3-H4. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and physical mapping, we define minimal domains necessary for interaction between POLE3-POLE4 and histones H3-H4. Biochemical analyses establish that POLE3-POLE4 is a histone chaperone that promotes tetrasome formation and DNA supercoiling in vitro. In cells, POLE3-POLE4 binds both newly synthesized and parental histones, and its depletion hinders helicase unwinding and chromatin PCNA unloading and compromises coordinated parental histone retention and new histone deposition. Collectively, our study reveals that POLE3-POLE4 possesses intrinsic H3-H4 chaperone activity, which facilitates faithful nucleosome dynamics at the replication fork.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes play a critical role in maintenance of the integrity of neuronal function, and mutations in genes that contribute to lysosome formation, transport, and activity are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, the multisubunit complex, BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), has been shown to be involved in positioning lysosomes within the cytoplasm, although the consequences of altered BORC function in adult animals have not been established. We show that a spontaneous truncation mutation in the mouse Borcs7 gene, identified through whole-genome sequencing followed by genetic complementation, results in progressive axonal dystrophy with dramatic impairment of motor function. Furthermore, mice homozygous for deletion of the entire Borcs7 coding sequence die shortly after birth, and neurons cultured from these animals show impaired centrifugal transport of lysosomes. This identifies BORCS7 as a central factor in axonal transport of lysosomes and a possible target for improving disease-related disturbances in this important function.

Abstract: Summary
The small RNA payload of mammalian sperm undergoes dramatic remodeling during development, as several waves of microRNAs and tRNA fragments are shipped to sperm during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. Here, we take advantage of this developmental process to probe the function of the sperm RNA payload in preimplantation development. We generated zygotes via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using sperm obtained from the proximal (caput) versus distal (cauda) epididymis and then characterized the development of the resulting embryos. Embryos generated using caput sperm significantly overexpress multiple regulatory factors throughout preimplantation development, subsequently implant inefficiently, and fail soon after implantation. Remarkably, microinjection of purified cauda-specific small RNAs into caput-derived embryos not only completely rescued preimplantation molecular defects but also suppressed the post-implantation embryonic lethality phenotype. These findings reveal an essential role for small RNA remodeling during post-testicular maturation of mammalian sperm and identify a specific preimplantation gene expression program responsive to sperm-delivered microRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptotic cell death removes unwanted cells and is regulated by interactions between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family. The regulation of apoptosis is thought to be crucial for normal embryonic development. Accordingly, complete loss of pro-survival MCL-1 or BCL-XL (BCL2L1) causes embryonic lethality. However, it is not known whether minor reductions in pro-survival proteins could cause developmental abnormalities. We explored the rate-limiting roles of MCL-1 and BCL-XL in development and show that combined loss of single alleles of Mcl-1 and Bcl-x causes neonatal lethality. Mcl-1+/–;Bcl-x+/– mice display craniofacial anomalies, but additional loss of a single allele of pro-apoptotic Bim (Bcl2l11) restores normal development. These findings demonstrate that the control of cell survival during embryogenesis is finely balanced and suggest that some human craniofacial defects, for which causes are currently unknown, may be due to subtle imbalances between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrantly slow translation elicits quality control pathways initiated by the ubiquitin ligase ZNF598. How ZNF598 discriminates physiologic from pathologic translation complexes and ubiquitinates stalled ribosomes selectively is unclear. Here, we find that the minimal unit engaged by ZNF598 is the collided di-ribosome, a molecular species that arises when a trailing ribosome encounters a slower leading ribosome. The collided di-ribosome structure reveals an extensive 40S-40S interface in which the ubiquitination targets of ZNF598 reside. The paucity of 60S interactions allows for different ribosome rotation states, explaining why ZNF598 recognition is indifferent to how the leading ribosome has stalled. The use of ribosome collisions as a proxy for stalling allows the degree of tolerable slowdown to be tuned by the initiation rate on that mRNA; hence, the threshold for triggering quality control is substrate specific. These findings illustrate how higher-order ribosome architecture can be exploited by cellular factors to monitor translation status.

Abstract: Summary
While mitochondrial dysfunction is emerging as key in Parkinson’s disease (PD), a central question remains whether mitochondria are actual disease drivers and whether boosting mitochondrial biogenesis and function ameliorates pathology. We address these questions using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and Drosophila models of GBA-related PD (GBA-PD), the most common PD genetic risk. Patient neurons display stress responses, mitochondrial demise, and changes in NAD+ metabolism. NAD+ precursors have been proposed to ameliorate age-related metabolic decline and disease. We report that increasing NAD+ via the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) significantly ameliorates mitochondrial function in patient neurons. Human neurons require nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) to maintain the NAD+ pool and utilize NRK1 to synthesize NAD+ from NAD+ precursors. Remarkably, NR prevents the age-related dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor decline in fly models of GBA-PD. Our findings suggest NR as a viable clinical avenue for neuroprotection in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how p53 activates certain gene programs and not others is critical. Here, we identify low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), a transmembrane endocytic receptor, as a p53 target gene. We show that, although LRP1 transcript expression is upregulated in response to both sub-lethal and lethal doses of p53-activating stress, LRP1 protein is only upregulated in response to sub-lethal stress. Interestingly, lethal doses of p53-activating stress inhibit LRP1 de novo translation through an miRNA-based translational repression mechanism. We show that the p53-regulated miRNAs miR-103 and miR-107 are significantly upregulated by lethal doses of stress, resulting in suppression of LRP1 translation and cell death. Our results define a negative feedback loop involving the p53-regulated coding gene LRP1 and p53-regulated miRNA genes. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the selective expression of p53 target genes in response to different stress intensities to elicit either cell survival or cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Microdeletions involving TBX1 result in variable congenital malformations known collectively as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). Tbx1-deficient mice and zebrafish recapitulate several disease phenotypes, including pharyngeal arch artery (PAA), head muscle (HM), and cardiac outflow tract (OFT) deficiencies. In zebrafish, these structures arise from nkx2.5+ progenitors in pharyngeal arches 2–6. Because pharyngeal arch morphogenesis is compromised in Tbx1-deficient animals, the malformations were considered secondary. Here, we report that the PAA, HM, and OFT phenotypes in tbx1 mutant zebrafish are primary and arise prior to pharyngeal arch morphogenesis from failed specification of the nkx2.5+ pharyngeal lineage. Through in situ analysis and lineage tracing, we reveal that nkx2.5 and tbx1 are co-expressed in this progenitor population. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that gdf3-ALK4 signaling is a downstream mediator of nkx2.5+ pharyngeal lineage specification. Collectively, these studies support a cellular mechanism potentially underlying the cardiovascular and craniofacial defects observed in the 22q11.2DS population.

Abstract: Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a cytosolic non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Because SYK mediates key receptor signaling pathways involving the B cell receptor and Fc receptors, SYK is an attractive target for autoimmune disease and cancer treatments. To date, representative oral SYK inhibitors, including fostamatinib (R406 or R788), entospletinib (GS-9973), cerdulatinib (PRT062070), and TAK-659, have been assessed in clinical trials. Here, we report the crystal structures of SYK in complex with two newly developed inhibitors possessing 4-aminopyrido[4,3-D]pyrimidine moieties (SKI-G-618 and SKI-O-85). One SYK inhibitor (SKI-G-618) exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against SYK, whereas the other inhibitor (SKI-O-85) exhibited a low inhibitory profile against SYK. Binding mode analysis indicates that a highly potent SYK inhibitor might be developed by modifying and optimizing the functional groups that interact with Leu377, Gly378, and Val385 in the G-loop and the nearby region in SYK. In agreement with our structural analysis, one of our SYK inhibitor (SKI-G-618) shows strong inhibitory activities on the β-hexosaminidase release and phosphorylation of SYK/Vav in RBL-2H3 cells. Taken together, our findings have important implications for the design of high affinity SYK inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotency is accompanied by the erasure of parental epigenetic memory, with naïve pluripotent cells exhibiting global DNA hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. Exit from pluripotency and priming for differentiation into somatic lineages is associated with genome-wide de novo DNA methylation. We show that during this phase, co-expression of enzymes required for DNA methylation turnover, DNMT3s and TETs, promotes cell-to-cell variability in this epigenetic mark. Using a combination of single-cell sequencing and quantitative biophysical modeling, we show that this variability is associated with coherent, genome-scale oscillations in DNA methylation with an amplitude dependent on CpG density. Analysis of parallel single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic profiling provides evidence for oscillatory dynamics both in vitro and in vivo. These observations provide insights into the emergence of epigenetic heterogeneity during early embryo development, indicating that dynamic changes in DNA methylation might influence early cell fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomes perform protein synthesis but are also involved in signaling processes, the full extent of which are still being uncovered. We report that phenotypes of mutating ribosomal proteins (Rps) are largely due to signaling. Using Drosophila, we discovered that a bZip-domain protein, Xrp1, becomes elevated in Rp mutant cells. Xrp1 reduces translation and growth, delays development, is responsible for gene expression changes, and causes the cell competition of Rp heterozygous cells from genetic mosaics. Without Xrp1, even cells homozygously deleted for Rp genes persist and grow. Xrp1 induction in Rp mutant cells depends on a particular Rp with regulatory effects, RpS12, and precedes overall changes in translation. Thus, effects of Rp mutations, even the reductions in translation and growth, depend on signaling through the Xrp1 pathway and are not simply consequences of reduced ribosome production limiting protein synthesis. One benefit of this system may be to eliminate Rp-mutant cells by cell competition.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic control of regulatory networks is only partially understood. Expression of Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF2) is controlled by genomic imprinting, mediated by silencing of the maternal allele. Loss of imprinting of IGF2 (LOI) is linked to intestinal and colorectal cancers, causally in murine models and epidemiologically in humans. However, the molecular underpinnings of the LOI phenotype are not clear. Surprisingly, in LOI cells, we find a reversal of the relative activities of two canonical signaling pathways triggered by IGF2, causing further rebalancing between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. A predictive mathematical model shows that this network rebalancing quantitatively accounts for the effect of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in both WT and LOI cells. This mechanism also quantitatively explains both the stable LOI phenotype and the therapeutic window for selective killing of LOI cells, and thus prevention of epigenetically controlled cancers. These findings suggest a framework for understanding epigenetically modified cell signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women. Here we report a role for the protein kinase p38α in coordinating the DNA damage response and limiting chromosome instability during breast tumor progression, and identify the DNA repair regulator CtIP as a p38α substrate. Accordingly, decreased p38α signaling results in impaired ATR activation and homologous recombination repair, with concomitant increases in replication stress, DNA damage, and chromosome instability, leading to cancer cell death and tumor regression. Moreover, we show that pharmacological inhibition of p38α potentiates the effects of taxanes by boosting chromosome instability in murine models and patient-derived xenografts, suggesting the potential interest of combining p38α inhibitors with chemotherapeutic drugs that induce chromosome instability.

Abstract: Summary
The primarily nuclear RNA-binding protein FUS (fused in sarcoma) forms pathological cytoplasmic inclusions in a subset of early-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. In response to cellular stress, FUS is recruited to cytoplasmic stress granules, which are hypothesized to act as precursors of pathological inclusions. We monitored the stress-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of endogenous FUS in an ex vivo mouse CNS model and human neural networks. We found that hyperosmolar, but not oxidative, stress induced robust cytoplasmic translocation of neuronal FUS, with transient nuclear clearance and loss of function. Surprisingly, this reaction is independent of stress granule formation and the molecular pathways activated by hyperosmolarity. Instead, it represents a mechanism mediated by cytoplasmic redistribution of Transportin 1/2 and is potentiated by transcriptional inhibition. Importantly, astrocytes, which remain unaffected in ALS/FTD-FUS, are spared from this stress reaction that may signify the initial event in the development of FUS pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue fibrosis is associated with inflammation and insulin resistance in human obesity. In particular, visceral fat fibrosis is correlated with hyperlipidemia and ectopic fat accumulation. Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA) is an important coactivator that mediates the transcription of extracellular matrix and other fibrogenic genes. Here, we examine the role of MRTFA in the development of adipose tissue fibrosis and identify a signaling pathway that regulates the fate of vascular progenitors. We demonstrate that obesity induces the formation of Sca1−, Sma+, ITGA5+ fibrogenic progenitor cells (FPCs) in adipose tissue. MRTFA deficiency in mice shifts the fate of perivascular progenitors from FPCs to adipocyte precursor cells and protects against chronic obesity-induced fibrosis and accompanying metabolic dysfunction, without a shift in energy expenditure. Our findings highlight the ITGA5-MRTFA pathway as a potential target to ameliorate obesity-associated metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Social interactions are essential to our mental health, and a deficit in social interactions is a hallmark characteristic of numerous brain disorders. Various subregions within the medial temporal lobe have been implicated in social memory, but the underlying mechanisms that tune these neural circuits remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that optical activation of excitatory entorhinal cortical perforant projections to the dentate gyrus (EC-DG) is necessary and sufficient for social memory retrieval. We further show that inducible disruption of p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling, a key pathway important for cytoskeletal reorganization, in the EC-DG circuit leads to impairments in synaptic function and social recognition memory, and, importantly, optogenetic activation of the EC-DG terminals reverses the social memory deficits in the transgenic mice. These results provide compelling evidence that activation of the EC-DG pathway underlies social recognition memory recall and that PAK signaling may play a critical role in modulating this process.

Abstract: Summary
While meta-analysis has demonstrated increased statistical power and more robust estimations in studies, the application of this commonly accepted methodology to cytometry data has been challenging. Different cytometry studies often involve diverse sets of markers. Moreover, the detected values of the same marker are inconsistent between studies due to different experimental designs and cytometer configurations. As a result, the cell subsets identified by existing auto-gating methods cannot be directly compared across studies. We developed MetaCyto for automated meta-analysis of both flow and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. By combining clustering methods with a silhouette scanning method, MetaCyto is able to identify commonly labeled cell subsets across studies, thus enabling meta-analysis. Applying MetaCyto across a set of ten heterogeneous cytometry studies totaling 2,926 samples enabled us to identify multiple cell populations exhibiting differences in abundance between demographic groups. Software is released to the public through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MetaCyto.html).

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination is essential for protein degradation and signaling and pivotal to many physiological processes. Ubiquitination of a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by the E3 ligase NEDD4-2 is required for p38 activation, but how GPCRs activate NEDD4-2 to promote ubiquitin-mediated signaling is not known. Here, we report that the GPCR protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) stimulates c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of NEDD4-2 to promote p38 signaling and endothelial barrier disruption. Using mass spectrometry, we identified a unique phosphorylated tyrosine (Y)-485 within the 2,3-linker peptide between WW domain 2 and 3 of NEDD4-2 in agonist-stimulated cells. Mutation of NEDD4-2 Y485 impaired E3 ligase activity and failed to rescue PAR1-stimulated p38 activation and endothelial barrier permeability. The purinergic P2Y1 receptor also required c-Src and NEDD4-2 tyrosine phosphorylation for p38 activation. These studies reveal a novel role for c-Src in GPCR-induced NEDD4-2 activation, which is critical for driving ubiquitin-mediated p38 inflammatory signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant expression of HOXA9 is a prominent feature of acute leukemia driven by diverse oncogenes. Here we show that HOXA9 overexpression in myeloid and B progenitor cells leads to significant enhancer reorganizations with prominent emergence of leukemia-specific de novo enhancers. Alterations in the enhancer landscape lead to activation of an ectopic embryonic gene program. We show that HOXA9 functions as a pioneer factor at de novo enhancers and recruits CEBPα and the MLL3/MLL4 complex. Genetic deletion of MLL3/MLL4 blocks histone H3K4 methylation at de novo enhancers and inhibits HOXA9/MEIS1-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo. These results suggest that therapeutic targeting of HOXA9-dependent enhancer reorganization can be an effective therapeutic strategy in acute leukemia with HOXA9 overexpression.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5) plays an important function in innate immunity and in initiating pro-inflammatory responses against pathogens. IRF-5 is constitutively expressed in several cell types, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells. We have previously reported that IRF-5 is also expressed in T cells during infection. The role of IRF-5 in T cells is yet unknown. Here, we demonstrate that IRF-5 is increasingly expressed in interferon (IFN)-γ+ CD4 T cells over the course of L. donovani infection. This transcription factor is induced by apoptotic material via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and promotes the expression of death receptor 5 (DR5). IRF-5 activation sensitizes CD4 T cells to cell death. Because tissue disruption and chronic inflammation are common characteristics of persistent infections, activation of IRF-5 in CD4 T cells may represent a common pathway that leads to suppression of protective CD4 T cell responses, favoring the establishment of chronic infection.

Abstract: Summary
Phase separation represents an important form of subcellular compartmentalization. However, relatively little is known about how the formation or disassembly of such compartments is regulated. In zebrafish, the Balbiani body (Bb) and the germ plasm (Gp) are intimately linked phase-separated structures essential for germ cell specification and home to many germ cell-specific mRNAs and proteins. Throughout development, these structures occur as a single large aggregate (Bb), which disperses throughout oogenesis and upon fertilization accumulates again into relatively large assemblies (Gp). Formation of the Bb requires Bucky ball (Buc), a protein with prion-like properties. We found that the multi-tudor domain-containing protein Tdrd6a interacts with Buc, affecting its mobility and aggregation properties. Importantly, lack of this regulatory interaction leads to significant defects in germ cell development. Our work presents insights into how prion-like protein aggregations can be regulated and highlights the biological relevance of such regulatory events.

Abstract: Summary
The bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein BRD4 is emerging as a promising anticancer therapeutic target. However, resistance to BET inhibitors often occurs, and it has been linked to aberrant degradation of BRD4 protein in cancer. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase DUB3 binds to BRD4 and promotes its deubiquitination and stabilization. Expression of DUB3 is transcriptionally repressed by the NCOR2-HDAC10 complex. The NCOR2 gene is frequently deleted in castration-resistant prostate cancer patient specimens, and loss of NCOR2 induces elevation of DUB3 and BRD4 proteins in cancer cells. DUB3-proficient prostate cancer cells are resistant to the BET inhibitor JQ1 in vitro and in mice, but this effect is diminished by DUB3 inhibitory agents such as CDK4/6 inhibitor in a RB-independent manner. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism causing BRD4 upregulation and drug resistance, suggesting that DUB3 is a viable therapeutic target to overcome BET inhibitor resistance in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is critical for maintaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis in response to mitochondrial stress, but early steps in UPRmt activation are not well understood. Here, we report a function for SPHK-1 sphingosine kinase in activating the UPRmt in C. elegans. Genetic deficiency of sphk-1 in the intestine inhibits UPRmt activation, whereas selective SPHK-1 intestinal overexpression is sufficient to activate the UPRmt. Acute mitochondrial stress leads to rapid, reversible localization of SPHK-1::GFP fusion proteins with mitochondrial membranes before UPRmt activation. SPHK-1 variants lacking kinase activity or mitochondrial targeting fail to rescue the stress-induced UPRmt activation defects of sphk-1 mutants. Activation of the UPRmt by the nervous system requires sphk-1 and elicits SPHK-1 mitochondrial association in the intestine. We propose that stress-regulated mitochondrial recruitment of SPHK-1 and subsequent S1P production are critical early events for both cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous UPRmt activation.

Abstract: Summary
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), regulate long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, although the sites of BDNF-TrkB receptors in this process are controversial. We used a viral-mediated approach to delete BDNF or TrkB specifically in CA1 and CA3 regions of the Schaffer collateral pathway. Deletion of BDNF in CA3 or CA1 revealed that presynaptic BDNF is involved in LTP induction, while postsynaptic BDNF contributes to LTP maintenance. Similarly, loss of presynaptic or postsynaptic TrkB receptors leads to distinct LTP deficits, with presynaptic TrkB required to maintain LTP, while postsynaptic TrkB is essential for LTP formation. In addition, loss of TrkB in CA3 significantly diminishes release probability, uncovering a role for presynaptic TrkB receptors in basal neurotransmission. Taken together, this direct comparison of presynaptic and postsynaptic BDNF-TrkB reveals insight into BDNF release and TrkB activation sites in hippocampal LTP.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking is a key modulator of excitatory synaptic transmission; however, intracellular vesicular transport of newly synthesized AMPARs has been little studied due to technical limitations. By combining molecular tools with imaging strategies in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we found that vesicles containing newly synthesized, GluA1-subunit-containing AMPARs are transported antero- and retrogradely at a mean speed of 1.5 μm.s−1. Synaptic activity and variations in intracellular calcium levels bidirectionally modulate GluA1 transport. Chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) initially induces a halt in GluA1 transport, followed by a sustained increase, while acute glutamate uncaging on synaptic spines arrests vesicular movements. GluA1 phosphomimetic mutants preferentially travel to the dendritic tip, probably to replenish extrasynaptic pools, distal to the soma. Our findings indicate that AMPAR intracellular transport is highly regulated during synaptic plasticity and likely controls AMPAR numbers at the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Class 2 CRISPR-Cas nucleases are programmable genome editing tools with promising applications in human health and disease. However, DNA cleavage at off-target sites that resemble the target sequence is a pervasive problem that remains poorly understood mechanistically. Here, we use quantitative kinetics to dissect the reaction steps of DNA targeting by Acidaminococcus sp Cas12a (also known as Cpf1). We show that Cas12a binds DNA tightly in two kinetically separable steps. Protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) recognition is followed by rate-limiting R-loop propagation, leading to inevitable DNA cleavage of both strands. Despite functionally irreversible binding, Cas12a discriminates strongly against mismatches along most of the DNA target sequence. This result implies substantial reversibility during R-loop formation—a late transition state—and defies common descriptions of a “seed” region. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the DNA cleavage patterns measured in vivo and observations of greater reported target specificity for Cas12a than for the Cas9 nuclease.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming of metabolic pathways determines cell functions and fate. In our work, we have used organelle-targeted ATP biosensors to evaluate cellular metabolic settings with high resolution in real time. Our data indicate that mitochondria dynamically supply ATP for glucose phosphorylation in a variety of cancer cell types. This hexokinase-dependent process seems to be reversed upon the removal of glucose or other hexose sugars. Our data further verify that mitochondria in cancer cells have increased ATP consumption. Similar subcellular ATP fluxes occurred in young mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). However, pancreatic beta cells, senescent MEFs, and MEFs lacking mitofusin 2 displayed completely different mitochondrial ATP dynamics, indicative of increased oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings add perspective to the variability of the cellular bioenergetics and demonstrate that live cell imaging of mitochondrial ATP dynamics is a powerful tool to evaluate metabolic flexibility and heterogeneity at a single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
The olfactory epithelium (OE) is a neurosensory organ required for the sense of smell. Turbinates, bony projections from the nasal cavity wall, increase the surface area within the nasal cavity lined by the OE. Here, we use engineered fibroblast growth factor 20 (Fgf20) knockin alleles to identify a population of OE progenitor cells that expand horizontally during development to populate all lineages of the mature OE. We show that these Fgf20-positive epithelium-spanning progenitor (FEP) cells are responsive to Wnt/β-Catenin signaling. Wnt signaling suppresses FEP cell differentiation into OE basal progenitors and their progeny and positively regulates Fgf20 expression. We further show that FGF20 signals to the underlying mesenchyme to regulate the growth of turbinates. These studies thus identify a population of OE progenitor cells that function to scale OE surface area with the underlying turbinates.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple brain regions respond to harmful nociceptive stimuli. However, it remains unclear as to whether behavioral avoidance of such stimuli can be modulated within the same or distinct brain networks. Here, we found subgroups of neurons localized within a well-defined brain region capable of mediating both innate and conditioned nociceptive avoidance in Drosophila. Neurons in the ventral, but not the dorsal, of the multiple-layer organized fan-shaped body (FB) are responsive to electric shock (ES). Silencing ES-responsive neurons, but not non-responsive neurons, leads to reduced avoidance of harmful stimuli, including ES and heat shock. Activating these neurons consistently triggers avoidance and can serve as an unconditional stimulus in an aversive classical conditioning task. Among the three groups of responsive neurons identified, two also have reduced activity in ES-conditioned odor avoidance. These results demonstrate that both innate and conditioned nociceptive avoidance might be represented within neurons confined to a single brain region.
