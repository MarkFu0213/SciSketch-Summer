Abstract: Summary
Mutations and inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) are observed in 15%–25% of cases of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Pten deletion induces myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and/or T-ALL in mice. Previous studies attributed Pten-loss-related hematopoietic defects and leukemogenesis to excessive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling. Although inhibition of this signal dramatically suppresses the growth of PTEN-null T-ALL cells in vitro, treatment with inhibitors of this pathway does not cause a complete remission in vivo. Here, we report that focal adhesion kinase (Fak), a protein substrate of Pten, also contributes to T-ALL development in Pten-null mice. Inactivation of the FAK signaling pathway by either genetic or pharmacologic methods significantly sensitizes both murine and human PTEN-null T-ALL cells to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibition when cultured in vitro on feeder layer cells or a matrix and in vivo.

Abstract: The vascular endothelium as well as subendothelium are objects of many researches as it is directly involved in a multiplicity of physiological and pathological settings. Detailed study of endothelial function became feasible with the development of techniques to culture endothelial cells (EC) in vitro. Limitations of this approach have become apparent with the realization that cell culture dedifferentiate with time and do not exhibit properties of intact tissue. Here we describe the development of a novel ex vivo tissue model to study cell–vascular wall interactions by using isolated mouse aorta patches. Validation of this model was performed by demonstrating cell attachment and changes in cell shape typical for cell spreading during adhesion. A major advantage of this model is that cell–endothelium interaction and its molecular backgrounds can now be studied more feasibly on an intact and native tissue.

Abstract: Summary
The Wnt3a/β-catenin and Activin/SMAD2,3 signaling pathways synergize to induce endodermal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells; however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Using ChIP-seq and GRO-seq analyses, we show here that Wnt3a-induced β-catenin:LEF-1 enhancers recruit cohesin to direct enhancer-promoter looping and activate mesendodermal (ME) lineage genes. Moreover, we find that LEF-1 and other hESC enhancers recruit RNAPII complexes (eRNAPII) that are highly phosphorylated at Ser5, but not Ser7. Wnt3a signaling further increases Ser5P-RNAPII at LEF-1 sites and ME gene promoters, indicating that elongation remains limiting. However, subsequent Activin/SMAD2,3 signaling selectively increases transcription elongation, P-TEFb occupancy, and Ser7P-RNAPII levels at these genes. Finally, we show that the Hippo regulator, YAP, functions with TEAD to regulate binding of the NELF negative elongation factor and block SMAD2,3 induction of ME genes. Thus, the Wnt3a/β-catenin and Activin/SMAD2,3 pathways act in concert to counteract YAP repression and upregulate ME genes during early hESC differentiation.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 degrades type IV collagen in the basement membrane and plays crucial roles in several pathological implications, including tumorigenesis and inflammation. In this study, we analyzed the effect of flavonols on MMP-9 expression in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells. Galangin and kaempferol efficiently decreased MMP-9 secretion, whereas fisetin only weakly decreased its secretion. Galangin and kaempferol did not affect cell viability at concentrations up to 30 μM. Luciferase reporter assays showed that galangin and kaempferol decrease transcription of MMP-9 mRNA. Moreover, galangin and kaempferol strongly reduce IκBα phosphorylation and significantly decrease JNK phosphorylation. These results indicate that galangin and kaempferol suppress PMA-induced MMP-9 expression by blocking activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Therefore, these flavonols could be used as chemopreventive agents to lower the risk of diseases involving MMP-9.

An Organized Co-assembly of Clathrin Adaptors Is Essential for Endocytosis,

Abstract: Summary
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the main trafficking route from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, is critical to many fundamental cellular processes. Clathrin, coupled to the membrane by adaptor proteins, is thought to play a major structural role in endocytosis by self-assembling into a cage-like lattice around the forming vesicle. Although clathrin adaptors are essential for endocytosis, little is known about their structural role in this process. Here we show that the membrane-binding domains of two conserved clathrin adaptors, Sla2 and Ent1, co-assemble in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner to form organized lattices on membranes. We determined the structure of the co-assembled lattice by electron cryo-microscopy and designed mutations that specifically impair the lattice formation in vitro. We show that these mutations block endocytosis in vivo. We suggest that clathrin adaptors not only link the polymerized clathrin to the membrane but also form an oligomeric structure, which is essential for membrane remodeling during endocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial diseases and aging are associated with defects in the oxidative phosphorylation machinery (OXPHOS), which are the only complexes composed of proteins encoded by separate genomes. To better understand genome coordination and OXPHOS recovery during mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined ATFS-1, a transcription factor that regulates mitochondria-to-nuclear communication during the mitochondrial UPR, via ChIP-sequencing. Surprisingly, in addition to regulating mitochondrial chaperone, OXPHOS complex assembly factor, and glycolysis genes, ATFS-1 bound directly to OXPHOS gene promoters in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Interestingly, atfs-1 was required to limit the accumulation of OXPHOS transcripts during mitochondrial stress, which required accumulation of ATFS-1 in the nucleus and mitochondria. Because balanced ATFS-1 accumulation promoted OXPHOS complex assembly and function, our data suggest that ATFS-1 stimulates respiratory recovery by fine-tuning OXPHOS expression to match the capacity of the suboptimal protein-folding environment in stressed mitochondria, while simultaneously increasing proteostasis capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Ras is mutated in up to 30% of cancers, including 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, causing it to be constitutively GTP-bound, and leading to activation of downstream effectors that promote a tumorigenic phenotype. As targeting Ras directly is difficult, there is a significant effort to understand the downstream biological processes that underlie its protumorigenic activity. Here, we show that expression of oncogenic Ras or direct activation of the MAPK pathway leads to increased mitochondrial fragmentation and that blocking this phenotype, through knockdown of the mitochondrial fission-mediating GTPase Drp1, inhibits tumor growth. This fission is driven by Erk2-mediated phosphorylation of Drp1 on Serine 616, and both this phosphorylation and mitochondrial fragmentation are increased in human pancreatic cancer. Finally, this phosphorylation is required for Ras-associated mitochondrial fission, and its inhibition is sufficient to block xenograft growth. Collectively, these data suggest mitochondrial fission may be a target for treating MAPK-driven malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapies under development have generally focused on either stimulating T cell immunity or driving antibody-directed effector functions of the innate immune system such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We find that a combination of an anti-tumor antigen antibody and an untargeted IL-2 fusion protein with delayed systemic clearance induces significant tumor control in aggressive isogenic tumor models via a concerted innate and adaptive response involving neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages, and CD8+ T cells. This combination therapy induces an intratumoral “cytokine storm” and extensive lymphocyte infiltration. Adoptive transfer of anti-tumor T cells together with this combination therapy leads to robust cures of established tumors and development of immunological memory.

Analysis of p53 Transactivation Domain Mutants Reveals Acad11 as a Metabolic Target Important for p53 Pro-Survival Function,

Abstract: Summary
The p53 tumor suppressor plays a key role in maintaining cellular integrity. In response to diverse stress signals, p53 can trigger apoptosis to eliminate damaged cells or cell-cycle arrest to enable cells to cope with stress and survive. However, the transcriptional networks underlying p53 pro-survival function are incompletely understood. Here, we show that in oncogenic-Ras-expressing cells, p53 promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and cell survival upon glucose starvation. Analysis of p53 transcriptional activation domain mutants reveals that these responses depend on p53 transactivation function. Using gene expression profiling and ChIP-seq analysis, we identify several p53-inducible fatty acid metabolism-related genes. One such gene, Acad11, encoding a protein involved in fatty acid oxidation, is required for efficient OXPHOS and cell survival upon glucose starvation. This study provides new mechanistic insight into the pro-survival function of p53 and suggests that targeting this pathway may provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention based on metabolic perturbation.

Abstract: Summary
Many cancers harbor oncogenic mutations of KRAS. Effectors mediating cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis in KRAS-mutated cancers are only incompletely understood. Here we identify cancer cell-expressed murine TRAIL-R, whose main function ascribed so far has been the induction of apoptosis as a crucial mediator of KRAS-driven cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis and in vivo Rac-1 activation. Cancer cell-restricted genetic ablation of murine TRAIL-R in autochthonous KRAS-driven models of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reduces tumor growth, blunts metastasis, and prolongs survival by inhibiting cancer cell-autonomous migration, proliferation, and invasion. Consistent with this, high TRAIL-R2 expression correlates with invasion of human PDAC into lymph vessels and with shortened metastasis-free survival of KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer patients.

Abstract: Because Schwann cells perform the triple tasks of myelination, axon guidance and neurotrophin synthesis, they are candidates for cell transplantation that might cure some types of nervous-system degenerative diseases or injuries. However, Schwann cells are difficult to obtain. As another option, ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) can be easily harvested from the nasal respiratory mucosa. Whether fibrin, an important transplantation vehicle, can improve the differentiation of EMSCs into Schwann-like cells (SLCs) deserves further research. EMSCs were isolated from rat nasal respiratory mucosa and were purified using anti-CD133 magnetic cell sorting. The purified cells strongly expressed HNK-1, nestin, p75NTR, S-100, and vimentin. Using nuclear staining, the MTT assay and Western blotting analysis of the expression of cell-cycle markers, the proliferation rate of EMSCs on a fibrin matrix was found to be significantly higher than that of cells grown on a plastic surface but insignificantly lower than that of cells grown on fibronectin. Additionally, the EMSCs grown on the fibrin matrix expressed myelination-related molecules, including myelin basic protein (MBP), 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and galactocerebrosides (GalCer), more strongly than did those grown on fibronectin or a plastic surface. Furthermore, the EMSCs grown on the fibrin matrix synthesized more neurotrophins compared with those grown on fibronectin or a plastic surface. The expression level of integrin in EMSCs grown on fibrin was similar to that of cells grown on fibronectin but was higher than that of cells grown on a plastic surface. These results demonstrated that fibrin not only promoted EMSC proliferation but also the differentiation of EMSCs into the SLCs. Our findings suggested that fibrin has great promise as a cell transplantation vehicle for the treatment of some types of nervous system diseases or injuries.

Abstract: High environmental salt elicits an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) in plants, which is generated by extracellular Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, such as vacuole and endoplasmic reticulum. This study aimed to determine the physiological mechanisms underlying Ca2+ release from vacuoles and its role in ionic homeostasis in Populus euphratica. In vivo Ca2+ imaging showed that NaCl treatment induced a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]cyt, which was accompanied by a subsequent release of vacuolar Ca2+. In cell cultures, NaCl-altered intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was abolished by antagonists of inositol (1, 4, 5) trisphosphate (IP3) and cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) signaling pathways, but not by slow vacuolar (SV) channel blockers. Furthermore, the NaCl-induced vacuolar Ca2+ release was dependent on extracellular ATP, extracellular Ca2+ influx, H2O2, and NO. In vitro Ca2+ flux recordings confirmed that IP3, cADPR, and Ca2+ induced substantial Ca2+ efflux from intact vacuoles, but this vacuolar Ca2+ flux did not directly respond to ATP, H2O2, or NO. Moreover, the IP3/cADPR-mediated vacuolar Ca2+ release enhanced the expression of salt-responsive genes that regulated a wide range of cellular processes required for ion homeostasis, including cytosolic K+ maintenance, Na+ and Cl− exclusion across the plasma membrane, and Na+/H+ and Cl−/H+ exchanges across the vacuolar membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Novel therapeutic approaches are urgently required for multiple myeloma (MM). We used a phenotypic screening approach using co-cultures of MM cells with bone marrow stromal cells to identify compounds that overcome stromal resistance. One such compound, BRD9876, displayed selectivity over normal hematopoietic progenitors and was discovered to be an unusual ATP non-competitive kinesin-5 (Eg5) inhibitor. A novel mutation caused resistance, suggesting a binding site distinct from known Eg5 inhibitors, and BRD9876 inhibited only microtubule-bound Eg5. Eg5 phosphorylation, which increases microtubule binding, uniquely enhanced BRD9876 activity. MM cells have greater phosphorylated Eg5 than hematopoietic cells, consistent with increased vulnerability specifically to BRD9876’s mode of action. Thus, differences in Eg5-microtubule binding between malignant and normal blood cells may be exploited to treat multiple myeloma. Additional steps are required for further therapeutic development, but our results indicate that unbiased chemical biology approaches can identify therapeutic strategies unanticipated by prior knowledge of protein targets.

Abstract: Summary
Excess dormant origins bound by the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) replicative helicase complex play a critical role in preventing replication stress, chromosome instability, and tumorigenesis. In response to DNA damage, replicating cells must coordinate DNA repair and dormant origin firing to ensure complete and timely replication of the genome; how cells regulate this process remains elusive. Herein, we identify a member of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, FANCI, as a key effector of dormant origin firing in response to replication stress. Cells lacking FANCI have reduced number of origins, increased inter-origin distances, and slowed proliferation rates. Intriguingly, ATR-mediated FANCI phosphorylation inhibits dormant origin firing while promoting replication fork restart/DNA repair. Using super-resolution microscopy, we show that FANCI co-localizes with MCM-bound chromatin in response to replication stress. These data reveal a unique role for FANCI as a modulator of dormant origin firing and link timely genome replication to DNA repair.

Abstract: Human osteosarcoma usually presented a high tendency to metastatic spread and caused poor outcomes, however, the underlying mechanism was still largely unknown. In the present study, using a series of in vitro experiments and an animal model, we investigated the roles of HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) during the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma. According with our results, HOTAIR was commonly overexpressed in osteosarcoma, which significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage, highly histological grade and poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that knockdown of HOTAIR could notably suppress cellular proliferation, inhibit invasion and decrease the secretion of MMP2 and MMP9 in osteosarcoma. Collectively, our results suggested that HOTAIR might be a potent therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Summary
Although casein kinase 1δ (CK1δ) is at the center of multiple signaling pathways, its role in the expansion of CNS progenitor cells is unknown. Using mouse cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GCPs) as a model for brain neurogenesis, we demonstrate that the loss of CK1δ or treatment of GCPs with a highly selective small molecule inhibits GCP expansion. In contrast, CK1δ overexpression increases GCP proliferation. Thus, CK1δ appears to regulate GCP neurogenesis. CK1δ is targeted for proteolysis via the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/CCdh1) ubiquitin ligase, and conditional deletion of the APC/CCdh1 activator Cdh1 in cerebellar GCPs results in higher levels of CK1δ. APC/CCdh1 also downregulates CK1δ during cell-cycle exit. Therefore, we conclude that APC/CCdh1 controls CK1δ levels to balance proliferation and cell-cycle exit in the developing CNS. Similar studies in medulloblastoma cells showed that CK1δ holds promise as a therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanotransduction pathways are activated in response to biophysical stimuli during the development or homeostasis of organs and tissues. In zebrafish, the blood-flow-sensitive transcription factor Klf2a promotes VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. However, the means by which the Klf2a mechanotransduction pathway is regulated to prevent continuous angiogenesis remain unknown. Here we report that the upregulation of klf2 mRNA causes enhanced egfl7 expression and angiogenesis signaling, which underlies cardiovascular defects associated with the loss of cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) proteins in the zebrafish embryo. Using CCM-protein-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells, we show that the misexpression of KLF2 mRNA requires the extracellular matrix-binding receptor β1 integrin and occurs in the absence of blood flow. Downregulation of β1 integrin rescues ccm mutant cardiovascular malformations in zebrafish. Our work reveals a β1 integrin-Klf2-Egfl7-signaling pathway that is tightly regulated by CCM proteins. This regulation prevents angiogenic overgrowth and ensures the quiescence of endothelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory response induced by microglia plays a critical role in the demise of neuronal populations in neuroinflammatory diseases. Although the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in microglia’s inflammatory response is fully acknowledged, little is known about endogenous ligands that trigger TLR4 activation. Here, we report that galectin-3 (Gal3) released by microglia acts as an endogenous paracrine TLR4 ligand. Gal3-TLR4 interaction was further confirmed in a murine neuroinflammatory model (intranigral lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) and in human stroke subjects. Depletion of Gal3 exerted neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects following global brain ischemia and in the neuroinflammatory LPS model. These results suggest that Gal3-dependent-TLR4 activation could contribute to sustained microglia activation, prolonging the inflammatory response in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Lamellipodia, the sheet-like protrusions of motile cells, consist of networks of actin filaments (F-actin) regulated by the ordered assembly from and disassembly into actin monomers (G-actin). Traditionally, G-actin is thought to exist as a homogeneous pool. Here, we show that there are two functionally and molecularly distinct sources of G-actin that supply lamellipodial actin networks. G-actin originating from the cytosolic pool requires the monomer-binding protein thymosin β4 (Tβ4) for optimal leading-edge localization, is targeted to formins, and is responsible for creating an elevated G/F-actin ratio that promotes membrane protrusion. The second source of G-actin comes from recycled lamellipodia F-actin. Recycling occurs independently of Tβ4 and appears to regulate lamellipodia homeostasis. Tβ4-bound G-actin specifically localizes to the leading edge because it does not interact with Arp2/3-mediated polymerization sites found throughout the lamellipodia. These findings demonstrate that actin networks can be constructed from multiple sources of monomers with discrete spatiotemporal functions.

Abstract: Summary
A long-held tenet of heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction is that it is triggered by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the PM. Here, we demonstrate that Gi is activated in the Golgi by GIV/Girdin, a non-receptor guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GIV-dependent activation of Gi at the Golgi maintains the finiteness of the cyclical activation of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), a fundamental step in vesicle traffic in all eukaryotes. Several interactions with other major components of Golgi trafficking—e.g., active Arf1, its regulator, ArfGAP2/3, and the adaptor protein β-COP—enable GIV to coordinately regulate Arf1 signaling. When the GIV-Gαi pathway is selectively inhibited, levels of GTP-bound Arf1 are elevated and protein transport along the secretory pathway is delayed. These findings define a paradigm in non-canonical G protein signaling at the Golgi, which places GIV-GEF at the crossroads between signals gated by the trimeric G proteins and the Arf family of monomeric GTPases.

Submandibular Parasympathetic Gangliogenesis Requires Sprouty-Dependent Wnt Signals from Epithelial Progenitors,

Abstract: Summary
Parasympathetic innervation is critical for submandibular gland (SMG) development and regeneration. Parasympathetic ganglia (PSG) are derived from Schwann cell precursors that migrate along nerves, differentiate into neurons, and coalesce within their target tissue to form ganglia. However, signals that initiate gangliogenesis after the precursors differentiate into neurons are unknown. We found that deleting negative regulators of FGF signaling, Sprouty1 and Sprouty2 (Spry1/2DKO), resulted in a striking loss of gangliogenesis, innervation, and keratin 5-positive (K5+) epithelial progenitors in the SMG. Here we identify Wnts produced by K5+ progenitors in the SMG as key mediators of gangliogenesis. Wnt signaling increases survival and proliferation of PSG neurons, and inhibiting Wnt signaling disrupts gangliogenesis and organ innervation. Activating Wnt signaling and reducing FGF gene dosage rescues gangliogenesis and innervation in both the Spry1/2DKO SMG and pancreas. Thus, K5+ progenitors produce Wnt signals to establish the PSG-epithelial communication required for organ innervation and progenitor cell maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic dissemination is the leading cause of death in cancer patients, which is particularly evident for high-risk sarcomas such as Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Previous research identified a crucial role for YB-1 in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of epithelial malignancies. Based on clinical data and two distinct animal models, we now report that YB-1 is also a major metastatic driver in high-risk sarcomas. Our data establish YB-1 as a critical regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) expression in sarcoma cells. YB-1 enhances HIF1α protein expression by directly binding to and activating translation of HIF1A messages. This leads to HIF1α-mediated sarcoma cell invasion and enhanced metastatic capacity in vivo, highlighting a translationally regulated YB-1-HIF1α axis in sarcoma metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Human centromeres are specified by a stably inherited epigenetic mark that maintains centromere position and function through a two-step mechanism relying on self-templating centromeric chromatin assembled with the histone H3 variant CENP-A, followed by CENP-A-dependent nucleation of kinetochore assembly. Nevertheless, natural human centromeres are positioned within specific megabase chromosomal regions containing α-satellite DNA repeats, which contain binding sites for the DNA sequence-specific binding protein CENP-B. We now demonstrate that CENP-B directly binds both CENP-A’s amino-terminal tail and CENP-C, a key nucleator of kinetochore assembly. DNA sequence-dependent binding of CENP-B within α-satellite repeats is required to stabilize optimal centromeric levels of CENP-C. Chromosomes bearing centromeres without bound CENP-B, including the human Y chromosome, are shown to mis-segregate in cells at rates several-fold higher than chromosomes with CENP-B-containing centromeres. These data demonstrate a DNA sequence-specific enhancement by CENP-B of the fidelity of epigenetically defined human centromere function.

Differential Phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs Regulates the Interplay between End-Processing and End-Ligation during Nonhomologous End-Joining,

Abstract: Summary
Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway that is conserved in eukaryotes. In vertebrates, NHEJ further acquires end-processing capacities (e.g., hairpin opening) in addition to direct end-ligation. The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) is a vertebrate-specific NHEJ factor that can be autophosphorylated or transphosphorylated by ATM kinase. Using a mouse model expressing a kinase-dead (KD) DNA-PKcs protein, we show that ATM-mediated transphosphorylation of DNA-PKcs regulates end-processing at the level of Artemis recruitment, while strict autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is necessary to relieve the physical blockage on end-ligation imposed by the DNA-PKcs protein itself. Accordingly, DNA-PKcsKD/KD mice and cells show severe end-ligation defects and p53- and Ku-dependent embryonic lethality, but open hairpin-sealed ends normally in the presence of ATM kinase activity. Together, our findings identify DNA-PKcs as the molecular switch that coordinates end-processing and end-ligation at the DNA ends through differential phosphorylations.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a family of effectors that originate from a common innate lymphoid cell progenitor. However, the transcriptional program that sets the identity of the ILC lineage remains elusive. Here, we show that NFIL3 is a critical regulator of the common helper-like innate lymphoid cell progenitor (CHILP). Cell-intrinsic Nfil3 ablation led to variably impaired development of fetal and adult ILC subsets. Conditional gene targeting demonstrated that NFIL3 exerted its function prior to ILC subset commitment. Accordingly, NFIL3 ablation resulted in loss of ID2+ CHILP and PLZF+ ILC progenitors. Nfil3 expression in lymphoid progenitors was under the control of the mesenchyme-derived hematopoietin IL-7, and NFIL3 exerted its function via direct Id2 regulation in the CHILP. Moreover, ectopic Id2 expression in Nfil3-null precursors rescued defective ILC lineage development in vivo. Our data establish NFIL3 as a key regulator of common helper-like ILC progenitors as they emerge during early lymphopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death. Genome sequencing of lung tumors from patients with squamous cell carcinoma has identified SMAD4 to be frequently mutated. Here, we use a mouse model to determine the molecular mechanisms by which Smad4 loss leads to lung cancer progression. Mice with ablation of Pten and Smad4 in airway epithelium develop metastatic adenosquamous tumors. Comparative transcriptomic and in vivo cistromic analyses determine that loss of PTEN and SMAD4 results in ELF3 and ErbB2 pathway activation due to decreased expression of ERRFI1, a negative regulator of ERBB2 in mouse and human cells. The combinatorial inhibition of ErbB2 and Akt signaling attenuate tumor progression and cell invasion, respectively. Expression profile analysis of human lung tumors substantiated the importance of the ErbB2/Akt/ELF3 signaling pathway as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic drug target for treating lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of cell surface receptors, regulate a wide range of physiological processes, and are the major targets of pharmaceutical drugs. Canonical signaling from GPCRs is relayed to intracellular effector proteins by trimeric G proteins, composed of α, β, and γ subunits (Gαβγ). Here, we report that G protein β subunits (Gβ) bind to DDB1 and that Gβ2 targets GRK2 for ubiquitylation by the DDB1-CUL4A-ROC1 ubiquitin ligase. Activation of GPCR results in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of DDB1 at Ser645 and its dissociation from Gβ2, leading to increase of GRK2 protein. Deletion of Cul4a results in cardiac hypertrophy in male mice that can be partially rescued by the deletion of one Grk2 allele. These results reveal a non-canonical function of the Gβ protein as a ubiquitin ligase component and a mechanism of feedback regulation of GPCR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The outer segment (OS) of the rod photoreceptor is a light-sensing cilium containing ∼1,000 membrane-bound discs. Each day, discs constituting the distal tenth of the OS are shed, whereas nascent discs are formed at the base of the OS through the incorporation of molecules transported from the inner segment. The mechanisms regulating these processes remain elusive. Here, we show that rhodopsin preferentially enters the OS in the dark. Photoexcitation of post-Golgi rhodopsins retains them in the inner segment. Disc-rim protein peripherin2/rds enters the OS following a rhythm complementary to that of rhodopsin. Light-dark cycle-regulated protein trafficking serves as a mechanism to segregate rhodopsin-rich and peripherin2/rds-rich discs into alternating stacks, which are flanked by characteristic cytoplasmic pockets. This periodic cytostructure divides the OS into approximately ten fractions, each containing discs synthesized in a single day. This mechanism may explain how the rod photoreceptor balances the quantity of discs added and removed daily.

Abstract: Summary
The altered metabolism of tumor cells confers a selective advantage for survival and proliferation, and studies have shown that targeting such metabolic shifts may be a useful therapeutic strategy. We developed an intensely fluorescent, rapidly responsive, pH-resistant, genetically encoded sensor of wide dynamic range, denoted SoNar, for tracking cytosolic NAD+ and NADH redox states in living cells and in vivo. SoNar responds to subtle perturbations of various pathways of energy metabolism in real time, and allowed high-throughput screening for new agents targeting tumor metabolism. Among > 5,500 unique compounds, we identified KP372-1 as a potent NQO1-mediated redox cycling agent that produced extreme oxidative stress, selectively induced cancer cell apoptosis, and effectively decreased tumor growth in vivo. This study demonstrates that genetically encoded sensor-based metabolic screening could serve as a valuable approach for drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
The UCH37 deubiquitylase functions in two large and very different complexes, the 26S proteasome and the INO80 chromatin remodeler. We have performed biochemical characterization and determined crystal structures of UCH37 in complexes with RPN13 and NFRKB, which mediate its recruitment to the proteasome and INO80, respectively. RPN13 and NFRKB make similar contacts to the UCH37 C-terminal domain but quite different contacts to the catalytic UCH domain. RPN13 can activate UCH37 by disrupting dimerization, although physiologically relevant activation likely results from stabilization of a surface competent for ubiquitin binding and modulation of the active-site crossover loop. In contrast, NFRKB inhibits UCH37 by blocking the ubiquitin-binding site and by disrupting the enzyme active site. These findings reveal remarkable commonality in mechanisms of recruitment, yet very different mechanisms of regulating enzyme activity, and provide a foundation for understanding the roles of UCH37 in the unrelated proteasome and INO80 complexes.

Abstract: Obesity is the fifth leading risk for death globally, and a significant challenge to global health. It is a common, complex, non-malignant disease and develops due to interactions between the genes and the environment. DNA methylation can act as a downstream effector of environmental signals; analysis of this process therefore holds substantial promise for identifying mechanisms through which genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to disease risk. To assess the effects of excessive weight and obesity on gene-specific methylation levels of promoter regions, we determined the methylation status of four genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress [interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and glucose transport 4 (GLUT4)] in blood cell-derived DNA from healthy women volunteers with a range of body mass indices (BMIs) by methylation-specific PCR. Interestingly, the samples from obese individuals (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) showed significantly increased hypermethylation for IL6 gene compared to normal weight (BMI < 23 kg/m2) and overweight samples (23 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m2) (P = 0.034 and P = 0.026). However, there was no statistically significant difference in promoter methylation of the other 3 genes between each group. These findings suggest that aberrant DNA methylation of IL6 gene promoter may play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of obesity and IL6 methylation could be used as molecular biomarker for obesity risk assessment. Further studies are required to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal translocations affecting mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) result in acute leukemias resistant to therapy. The leukemogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins is dependent on their interaction with menin, providing basis for therapeutic intervention. Here we report the development of highly potent and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction, MI-463 and MI-503, and show their profound effects in MLL leukemia cells and substantial survival benefit in mouse models of MLL leukemia. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of these compounds in primary samples derived from MLL leukemia patients. Overall, we demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction represents an effective treatment for MLL leukemias in vivo and provide advanced molecular scaffold for clinical lead identification.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial spore can rapidly convert from a dormant to a fully active cell. Here we study this remarkable cellular transition in Bacillus subtilis and reveal the identity of the newly synthesized proteins throughout spore revival. Our analysis uncovers a highly ordered developmental program that correlates with the spore morphological changes and reveals the spatial and temporal molecular events fundamental to reconstruct a cell. As opposed to current knowledge, we found that translation takes place during the earliest revival event, termed germination, a process hitherto considered to occur without the need for any macromolecule synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that translation is required for execution of germination and relies on the bona fide translational factors RpmE and Tig. Our study sheds light on the spore revival process and on the vital building blocks underlying cellular awakening, thereby paving the way for designing new antimicrobial agents to eradicate spore-forming pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
RIPK1 and RIPK3, two closely related RIPK family members, have emerged as important regulators of pathologic cell death and inflammation. In the current work, we report that the Bcr-Abl inhibitor and anti-leukemia agent ponatinib is also a first-in-class dual inhibitor of RIPK1 and RIPK3. Ponatinib potently inhibited multiple paradigms of RIPK1- and RIPK3-dependent cell death and inflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) gene transcription. We further describe design strategies that utilize the ponatinib scaffold to develop two classes of inhibitors (CS and PN series), each with greatly improved selectivity for RIPK1. In particular, we detail the development of PN10, a highly potent and selective “hybrid” RIPK1 inhibitor, capturing the best properties of two different allosteric RIPK1 inhibitors, ponatinib and necrostatin-1. Finally, we show that RIPK1 inhibitors from both classes are powerful blockers of TNF-induced injury in vivo. Altogether, these findings outline promising candidate molecules and design approaches for targeting RIPK1- and RIPK3-driven inflammatory pathologies.

Abstract: Cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychotropic cannabinoid found in Cannabis plant, has been shown to influence cardiovascular functions under various physiological and pathological conditions. In the present study, the effects of CBD on contractility and electrophysiological properties of rat ventricular myocytes were investigated. Video edge detection was used to measure myocyte shortening. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured in cells loaded with the Ca2+ sensitive fluorescent indicator fura-2 AM. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to measure action potential and Ca2+ currents. Radioligand binding was employed to study pharmacological characteristics of CBD binding. CBD (1μM) caused a significant decrease in the amplitudes of electrically evoked myocyte shortening and Ca2+ transients. However, the amplitudes of caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transients and the rate of recovery of electrically evoked Ca2+ transients following caffeine application were not altered. CBD (1μM) significantly decreased the duration of APs. Further studies on L-type Ca2+ channels indicated that CBD inhibits these channels with IC50 of 0.1μM in a voltage-independent manner. Radioligand studies indicated that the specific binding of [3H]Isradipine, was not altered significantly by CBD. The results suggest that CBD depresses myocyte contractility by suppressing L-type Ca2+ channels at a site different than dihydropyridine binding site and inhibits excitation–contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes.

Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 regulate expression of genes involved in proliferation and development. In mouse early embryos, however, canonical PRC1 localizes to paternal pericentric heterochromatin (pat-PCH), where it represses transcription of major satellite repeats. In contrast, maternal PCH (mat-PCH) is enriched for H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) and Hp1β. How PRC1 is targeted to pat-PCH, yet excluded from mat-PCH, has remained elusive. Here, we identify a PRC1 targeting mechanism that relies on Cbx2 and Hp1β. Cbx2 directs catalytically active PRC1 to PCH via its chromodomain (CDCbx2) and neighboring AT-hook (ATCbx2) binding to H3K27me3 and AT-rich major satellites, respectively. CDCbx2 prevents ATCbx2 from interacting with DNA at PCH marked by H3K9me3 and Hp1β. Loss-of-function studies show that Hp1β and not H3K9me3 prevents PRC1 targeting to mat-PCH. Our findings indicate that CDCbx2 and ATCbx2 separated by a short linker function together to integrate H3K9me3/HP1 and H3K27me3 states.

Abstract: The endocrine cells (ECs) of the gastrointestinal mucosa form the largest endocrine system in the body, not only in terms of cell numbers but also in terms of the different produced substances. Data describing the association between the relative distributions of the peptide-specific ECs in relation to feeding habits can be useful tools that enable the creation of a general expected pattern of EC distribution. We aimed to investigate the distribution of ECs immunoreactive for the peptides gastrin (GAS), cholecystokinin (CCK-8), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in different segments of the digestive tract of carnivorous fish dorado (Salminus brasiliensis) by using immunohistochemistry procedures. The distribution of endocrine cells immunoreactive for gastrin (GAS), cholecystokinin (CCK-8), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in digestive tract of dorado S. brasiliensis was examined by immunohistochemistry. The results describe the association between the distribution of the peptide-specific endocrine cells and feeding habits in different carnivorous fish. The largest number of endocrine cells immunoreactive for GAS, CCK-8, and CGRP were found in the pyloric stomach region and the pyloric caeca. However, NPY-immunoreactive endocrine cells were markedly restricted to the midgut. The distribution pattern of endocrine cells identified in S. brasiliensis is similar to that found in other carnivorous fishes.

Abstract: Acrylamide is a common chemical found in heated starchy foods especially potato products. We investigated, for the first time, the effect of acrylamide, alone or with rosemary, on the structure of gastric mucosa of adult male albino rats. Stomach sections were examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. Quantitative immmunohistochemical assessments of the expression of caspase-3, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EPGR) were performed. Our results showed that acrylamide produced mucosal erosions and depletion of the protective surface mucus together with widespread inflammatory infiltration. In addition, there was significantly increased expression of caspase-3 and iNOS and weak expression of EPGR. Rosemary exerted a protective effect against acrylamide-induced gastric toxicity via reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation as well as accelerating the healing process. The results of this work add to the known toxic effects of acrylamide and provide a new insight into the possible use of rosemary to ameliorate these effects.

Abstract: Summary
Because tissue regeneration deteriorates with age, it is generally assumed that the younger the animal, the better it compensates for tissue damage. We have examined the effect of young age on compensatory proliferation of pancreatic β cells in vivo. Surprisingly, β cells in suckling mice fail to enter the cell division cycle in response to a diabetogenic injury or increased glycolysis. The potential of β cells for compensatory proliferation is acquired following premature weaning to normal chow, but not to a diet mimicking maternal milk. In addition, weaning coincides with enhanced glucose-stimulated oxidative phosphorylation and insulin secretion from islets. Transcriptome analysis reveals that weaning increases the expression of genes involved in replication licensing, suggesting a mechanism for increased responsiveness to the mitogenic activity of high glucose. We propose that weaning triggers a discrete maturation step of β cells, elevating both the mitogenic and secretory response to glucose.

Abstract: Summary
Blood pressure maintenance is vital for systemic homeostasis, and angiotensin II is a critical regulator. The upstream mechanisms that regulate angiotensin II are not completely understood. Here, we show that angiotensin II is regulated by ERp44, a factor involved in disulfide bond formation in the ER. In mice, genetic loss of ERp44 destabilizes angiotensin II and causes hypotension. We show that ERp44 forms a mixed disulfide bond with ERAP1, an aminopeptidase that cleaves angiotensin II. ERp44 controls the release of ERAP1 in a redox-dependent manner to control blood pressure. Additionally, we found that systemic inflammation triggers ERAP1 retention in the ER to inhibit hypotension. These findings suggest that the ER redox state calibrates serum angiotensin II levels via regulation of the ERp44-ERAP1 complex. Our results reveal a link between ER function and normotension and implicate the ER redox state as a potential risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Escherichia coli AcrAB-TolC is a multidrug efflux pump that expels a wide range of toxic substrates. The dynamic nature of the binding or low affinity between the components has impeded elucidation of how the three components assemble in the functional state. Here, we created fusion proteins composed of AcrB, a transmembrane linker, and two copies of AcrA. The fusion protein exhibited acridine pumping activity, suggesting that the protein reflects the functional structure in vivo. To discern the assembling mode with TolC, the AcrBA fusion protein was incubated with TolC or a chimeric protein containing the TolC aperture tip region. Three-dimensional structures of the complex proteins were determined through transmission electron microscopy. The overall structure exemplifies the adaptor bridging model, wherein the funnel-like AcrA hexamer forms an intermeshing cogwheel interaction with the α-barrel tip region of TolC, and a direct interaction between AcrB and TolC is not allowed. These observations provide a structural blueprint for understanding multidrug resistance in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Individual mammalian cells exhibit large variability in cellular volume, even with the same absolute DNA content, and so must compensate for differences in DNA concentration in order to maintain constant concentration of gene expression products. Using single-molecule counting and computational image analysis, we show that transcript abundance correlates with cellular volume at the single-cell level due to increased global transcription in larger cells. Cell fusion experiments establish that increased cellular content itself can directly increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to DNA content, most likely through sequestration of a transcriptional factor to DNA. Analysis of transcriptional bursts reveals a separate mechanism for gene dosage compensation after DNA replication that enables proper transcriptional output during early and late S phase. Our results provide a framework for quantitatively understanding the relationships among DNA content, cell size, and gene expression variability in single cells.

Abstract: Summary
Strategies that simultaneously enhance the survival and glucose responsiveness of insulin-producing β cells will greatly augment β cell replacement therapies in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We show that genetic and pharmacologic mimetics of the phosphorylated BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain of BAD impart β-cell-autonomous protective effects in the face of stress stimuli relevant to β cell demise in T1D. Importantly, these benefits translate into improved engraftment of donor islets in transplanted diabetic mice, increased β cell viability in islet grafts, restoration of insulin release, and diabetes reversal. Survival of β cells in this setting is not merely due to the inability of phospho-BAD to suppress prosurvival BCL-2 proteins but requires its activation of the glucose-metabolizing enzyme glucokinase. Thus, BAD phospho-BH3 mimetics may prove useful in the restoration of functional β cell mass in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA damage response (DDR) induces the expression of type I interferons (IFNs), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show the presence of cytosolic DNA in different mouse and human tumor cells. Treatment of cells with genotoxic agents increased the levels of cytosolic DNA in a DDR-dependent manner. Cloning of cytosolic DNA molecules from mouse lymphoma cells suggests that cytosolic DNA is derived from unique genomic loci and has the potential to form non-B DNA structures, including R-loops. Overexpression of Rnaseh1, which resolves R-loops, reduced the levels of cytosolic DNA, type I Ifn transcripts, and type I IFN-dependent rejection of lymphoma cells. Live-cell imaging showed a dynamic contact of cytosolic DNA with mitochondria, an important organelle for innate immune recognition of cytosolic nucleotides. In summary, we found that cytosolic DNA is present in many tumor cells and contributes to the immunogenicity of tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
The 5S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) complex, consisting of RPL11, RPL5, and 5S rRNA, is implicated in p53 regulation under ribotoxic stress. Here, we show that the 5S RNP contributes to p53 activation and promotes cellular senescence in response to oncogenic or replicative stress. Oncogenic stress accelerates rRNA transcription and replicative stress delays rRNA processing, resulting in RPL11 and RPL5 accumulation in the ribosome-free fraction, where they bind MDM2. Experimental upregulation of rRNA transcription or downregulation of rRNA processing, mimicking the nucleolus under oncogenic or replicative stress, respectively, also induces RPL11-mediated p53 activation and cellular senescence. We demonstrate that exogenous expression of certain rRNA-processing factors rescues the processing defect, attenuates p53 accumulation, and increases replicative lifespan. To summarize, the nucleolar-5S RNP-p53 pathway functions as a senescence inducer in response to oncogenic and replicative stresses.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian genes are composed of exons, but the evolutionary origins and functions of new internal exons are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed patterns of exon gain using deep cDNA sequencing data from five mammals and one bird, identifying thousands of species- and lineage-specific exons. Most new exons derived from unique rather than repetitive intronic sequence. Unlike exons conserved across mammals, species-specific internal exons were mostly located in 5′ UTRs and alternatively spliced. They were associated with upstream intronic deletions, increased nucleosome occupancy, and RNA polymerase II pausing. Genes containing new internal exons had increased gene expression, but only in tissues in which the exon was included. Increased expression correlated with the level of exon inclusion, promoter proximity, and signatures of cotranscriptional splicing. Altogether, these findings suggest that increased splicing at the 5′ ends of genes enhances expression and that changes in 5′ end splicing alter gene expression between tissues and between species.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of pluripotency is a gradual event whose initiating factors are largely unknown. Here we report the earliest metabolic changes induced during the first hours of differentiation. High-resolution NMR identified 44 metabolites and a distinct metabolic transition occurring during early differentiation. Metabolic and transcriptional analyses showed that pluripotent cells produced acetyl-CoA through glycolysis and rapidly lost this function during differentiation. Importantly, modulation of glycolysis blocked histone deacetylation and differentiation in human and mouse embryonic stem cells. Acetate, a precursor of acetyl-CoA, delayed differentiation and blocked early histone deacetylation in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors upstream of acetyl-CoA caused differentiation of pluripotent cells, while those downstream delayed differentiation. Our results show a metabolic switch causing a loss of histone acetylation and pluripotent state during the first hours of differentiation. Our data highlight the important role metabolism plays in pluripotency and suggest that a glycolytic switch controlling histone acetylation can release stem cells from pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
HP1 enrichment at pericentric heterochromatin is essential for proper chromosome segregation. While H3K9me3 is thought to be a major contributor to HP1 enrichment at pericentric domains, in mouse cells, the SUMO-protease SENP7 is required in addition to H3K9me3. How this is achieved remains elusive. Here, we find that loss of SENP7 leads to an increased time spent in mitosis. Furthermore, we reveal that a short module comprising two consecutive HP1 interaction motifs on SENP7 is the determinant for HP1 enrichment and acts by restricting HP1 mobility at pericentric domains. We propose a mechanism for maintenance of HP1 enrichment in which this module functions on top of H3K9me3 to lock contiguous HP1 molecules already docked on H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes. H3K9me3 would thus promote HP1 enrichment only if a locking system is in place. This mechanism may apply to other nuclear domains to contribute to the control of genome plasticity and integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs) are poorly understood and frequently lethal brain tumors with few treatment options. Using a mouse model of the disease and a large cohort of human CPCs, we performed a cross-species, genome-wide search for oncogenes within syntenic regions of chromosome gain. TAF12, NFYC, and RAD54L co-located on human chromosome 1p32-35.3 and mouse chromosome 4qD1-D3 were identified as oncogenes that are gained in tumors in both species and required for disease initiation and progression. TAF12 and NFYC are transcription factors that regulate the epigenome, whereas RAD54L plays a central role in DNA repair. Our data identify a group of concurrently gained oncogenes that cooperate in the formation of CPC and reveal potential avenues for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The dimensions of axons and synaptic terminals determine cell-intrinsic properties of neurons; however, the cellular mechanisms selectively controlling establishment and maintenance of neuronal compartments remain poorly understood. Here, we show that two giant Drosophila Ankyrin2 isoforms, Ank2-L and Ank2-XL, and the MAP1B homolog Futsch form a membrane-associated microtubule-organizing complex that determines axonal diameter, supports axonal transport, and provides independent control of synaptic dimensions and stability. Ank2-L controls microtubule and synaptic stability upstream of Ank2-XL that selectively controls microtubule organization. Synergistically with Futsch, Ank2-XL provides three-dimensional microtubule organization and is required to establish appropriate synaptic dimensions and release properties. In axons, the Ank2-XL/Futsch complex establishes evenly spaced, grid-like microtubule organization and determines axonal diameter in the absence of neurofilaments. Reduced microtubule spacing limits anterograde transport velocities of mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. Our data identify control of microtubule architecture as a central mechanism to selectively control neuronal dimensions, functional properties, and connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease, but insight into virus-host interactions remains limited. We systematically used affinity purification/mass spectrometry to define the host interactions of all ten HCV proteins in hepatoma cells. We combined these studies with RNAi knockdown of corresponding genes using a two-step scoring approach to generate a map of 139 high-confidence HCV-host protein-protein interactions. We found mitochondrial proteins highly involved in HCV infection and characterized an interaction between the viral core protein and host protein within bgcn homolog (WIBG). Expression of core prevents WIBG from binding its regular interaction partners Y14 and Magoh, two known mediators of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. We discovered that this surveillance pathway is disrupted in HCV-infected cells, causing potentially harmful transcripts to accumulate. Our study provides a comprehensive view of HCV-host interactions and uncovers mechanisms for how HCV perturbs host functions during infection.

The let-7 microRNA Directs Vulval Development through a Single Target,

Abstract: Summary
The let-7 microRNA (miRNA) regulates stemness in animals ranging from worms to humans. However, the cause of the dramatic vulval rupturing phenotype of let-7 mutant C. elegans has remained unknown. Consistent with the notion that miRNAs function by coordinately tuning the expression of many targets, bursting may result from joint dysregulation of several targets, possibly in the epidermis. Alternatively, overexpression of LET-60/RAS, a key vulva development gene and a phylogenetically conserved target of let-7, may be responsible. Here, we show that let-7 functions in the vulval-uterine system to ensure vulval integrity but that regulation of most targets of let-7, including LET-60/RAS, is dispensable. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit endogenous let-7 target sites, we found that regulation of LIN-41/TRIM71 alone is necessary and sufficient to prevent vulval rupturing. Hence, let-7 does not function to reduce gene expression noise broadly, but to direct vulval development through extensive regulation of a single, defined target.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal myocytes are metabolically active and susceptible to insulin resistance and are thus implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This complex disease involves systemic metabolic changes, and their elucidation at the systems level requires genome-wide data and biological networks. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a network context for the integration of high-throughput data. We generated myocyte-specific RNA-sequencing data and investigated their correlation with proteome data. These data were then used to reconstruct a comprehensive myocyte GEM. Next, we performed a meta-analysis of six studies comparing muscle transcription in T2D versus healthy subjects. Transcriptional changes were mapped on the myocyte GEM, revealing extensive transcriptional regulation in T2D, particularly around pyruvate oxidation, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and tetrahydrofolate metabolism, connected through the downregulated dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Strikingly, the gene signature underlying this metabolic regulation successfully classifies the disease state of individual samples, suggesting that regulation of these pathways is a ubiquitous feature of myocytes in response to T2D.

Abstract: 2,5-Di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (TBQ) is a reversible inhibitor of SERCA, potentially making it a useful tool to study the effects of SERCA inhibition in cardiac cells. However, it is unknown if TBQ also has effects on other components of ventricular Ca handling. The aim of these experiments was to characterise the effects of TBQ on Ca handling in rat ventricular myocytes and assess its suitability as a specific inhibitor of SERCA. This was achieved by voltage clamp via perforated patch and [Ca2+]i measurement using Fluo-3 AM. TBQ produced a fully reversible, concentration dependent decrease in the rate of systolic Ca decay. 10μM TBQ decreased the amplitude of the systolic Ca transient by 48±5% and the rate of decay by 54±6%. SR Ca content was also reduced by 62±4%. However, 10μM TBQ also decreased the peak L-type Ca current by 23±7%. At higher concentrations (100μM), TBQ also activated an outward current with a current–voltage relationship consistent with a potassium current. This outward current was abolished by Glibenclamide (100μM). These data show that TBQ can be used to reversibly inhibit SERCA. However, at concentrations that decrease SERCA activity, TBQ also decreases the L-type Ca current and (at higher concentrations) activates an outward current which appears to be an ATP dependent potassium current. We conclude that TBQ cannot be used as a specific inhibitor of SERCA in rat ventricular myocytes.

Abstract: Protein O-GlcNAcylation, dictated by cellular UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) levels, plays a crucial role in posttranslational modifications. The enzyme GlcNAc kinase (NAGK, E.C. 2.7.1.59) catalyzes the formation of GlcNAc-6-phosphate, which is a major substrate for the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc. Recent studies have revealed the expression of NAGK in different types of cells especially in neuronal dendrites. Here, by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and immunonucleochemistry (INC) of cultured rat hippocampal neurons, HEK293T and GT1-7 cells, we have showed that NAGK immuno-reactive punctae being present in the nucleoplasm colocalized with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated protein N (snRNPN) and p54NRB, which are speckle and paraspeckle markers, respectively. Furthermore, NAGK IR cluster was also found to be colocalized with GTF2H5 (general transcription factor IIH, polypeptide 5) immuno reactive punctae. In addition, relative localization to the ring of nuclear lamin matrix and to GlcNAc, which is highly enriched in nuclear pore complexes, showed that NAGK surrounds the nucleus at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear outer membrane. By in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) we confirmed the colocalization of NAGK with snRNPN in the nucleus and in dendrites, while we also verified the interactions of NAGK with p54NRB, and with GTF2H5 in the nucleus. These associations between NAGK with speckle, paraspeckle and general transcription factor suggest its regulatory roles in gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
SIRT3 is a member of the Sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacylases and plays a critical role in metabolic regulation. Organism-wide SIRT3 loss manifests in metabolic alterations; however, the coordinating role of SIRT3 among metabolically distinct tissues is unknown. Using multi-tissue quantitative proteomics comparing fasted wild-type mice to mice lacking SIRT3, innovative bioinformatic analysis, and biochemical validation, we provide a comprehensive view of mitochondrial acetylation and SIRT3 function. We find SIRT3 regulates the acetyl-proteome in core mitochondrial processes common to brain, heart, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle, but differentially regulates metabolic pathways in fuel-producing and fuel-utilizing tissues. We propose an additional maintenance function for SIRT3 in liver and kidney where SIRT3 expression is elevated to reduce the acetate load on mitochondrial proteins. We provide evidence that SIRT3 impacts ketone body utilization in the brain and reveal a pivotal role for SIRT3 in the coordination between tissues required for metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Thioredoxin (TRX) is a disulfide reductase present ubiquitously in all taxa and plays an important role as a regulator of cellular redox state. Recently, a redox-independent, chaperone function has also been reported for some thioredoxins. We previously identified nodulin-35, the subunit of soybean uricase, as an interacting target of a cytosolic soybean thioredoxin, GmTRX. Here we report the further characterization of the interaction, which turns out to be independent of the disulfide reductase function and results in the co-localization of GmTRX and nodulin-35 in peroxisomes, suggesting a possible function of GmTRX in peroxisomes. In addition, the chaperone function of GmTRX was demonstrated in in vitro molecular chaperone activity assays including the thermal denaturation assay and malate dehydrogenase aggregation assay. Our results demonstrate that the target of GmTRX is not only confined to the nodulin-35, but many other peroxisomal proteins, including catalase (AtCAT), transthyretin-like protein 1 (AtTTL1), and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 4 (AtACX4), also interact with the GmTRX. Together with an increased uricase activity of nodulin-35 and reduced ROS accumulation observed in the presence of GmTRX in our results, especially under heat shock and oxidative stress conditions, it appears that GmTRX represents a novel thioredoxin that is co-localized to the peroxisomes, possibly providing functional integrity to peroxisomal proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Intravital imaging of BRAF-mutant melanoma cells containing an ERK/MAPK biosensor reveals how the tumor microenvironment affects response to BRAF inhibition by PLX4720. Initially, melanoma cells respond to PLX4720, but rapid reactivation of ERK/MAPK is observed in areas of high stromal density. This is linked to “paradoxical” activation of melanoma-associated fibroblasts by PLX4720 and the promotion of matrix production and remodeling leading to elevated integrin β1/FAK/Src signaling in melanoma cells. Fibronectin-rich matrices with 3–12 kPa elastic modulus are sufficient to provide PLX4720 tolerance. Co-inhibition of BRAF and FAK abolished ERK reactivation and led to more effective control of BRAF-mutant melanoma. We propose that paradoxically activated MAFs provide a “safe haven” for melanoma cells to tolerate BRAF inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial genome relies heavily on post-transcriptional events for its proper expression, and misregulation of this process can cause mitochondrial genetic diseases in humans. Here, we report that a novel translational variant of Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase (FASTK) co-localizes with mitochondrial RNA granules and is required for the biogenesis of ND6 mRNA, a mitochondrial-encoded subunit of the NADH dehydrogenase complex (complex I). We show that ablating FASTK expression in cultured cells and mice results specifically in loss of ND6 mRNA and reduced complex I activity in vivo. FASTK binds at multiple sites along the ND6 mRNA and its precursors and cooperates with the mitochondrial degradosome to ensure regulated ND6 mRNA biogenesis. These data provide insights into the mechanism and control of mitochondrial RNA processing within mitochondrial RNA granules.

Abstract: Summary
During apoptosis, the mitochondrial outer membrane is permeabilized, leading to the release of cytochrome c that activates downstream caspases. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) has historically been thought to occur synchronously and completely throughout a cell, leading to rapid caspase activation and apoptosis. Using a new imaging approach, we demonstrate that MOMP is not an all-or-nothing event. Rather, we find that a minority of mitochondria can undergo MOMP in a stress-regulated manner, a phenomenon we term “minority MOMP.” Crucially, minority MOMP leads to limited caspase activation, which is insufficient to trigger cell death. Instead, this caspase activity leads to DNA damage that, in turn, promotes genomic instability, cellular transformation, and tumorigenesis. Our data demonstrate that, in contrast to its well-established tumor suppressor function, apoptosis also has oncogenic potential that is regulated by the extent of MOMP. These findings have important implications for oncogenesis following either physiological or therapeutic engagement of apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Although chemokines are sufficient for chemotaxis of various cells, increasing evidence exists for their fine-tuning by selective proteolytic processing. Using a model of immune cell chemotaxis into the CNS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE]) that permits precise localization of immigrating leukocytes at the blood-brain barrier, we show that, whereas chemokines are required for leukocyte migration into the CNS, additional MMP-2/9 activities specifically at the border of the CNS parenchyma strongly enhance this transmigration process. Cytokines derived from infiltrating leukocytes regulate MMP-2/9 activity at the parenchymal border, which in turn promotes astrocyte secretion of chemokines and differentially modulates the activity of different chemokines at the CNS border, thereby promoting leukocyte migration out of the cuff. Hence, cytokines, chemokines, and cytokine-induced MMP-2/9 activity specifically at the inflammatory border collectively act to accelerate leukocyte chemotaxis across the parenchymal border.

Abstract: Summary
mTORC1 is essential for regulating cell growth and metabolism in response to various environmental stimuli. Heterodimeric Rag GTPases are required for amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation at the lysosome. However, the mechanism by which amino acids regulate Rag activation remains not fully understood. Here, we identified the lysosome-anchored E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF152 as an essential negative regulator of the mTORC1 pathway by targeting RagA for K63-linked ubiquitination. RNF152 interacts with and ubiquitinates RagA in an amino-acid-sensitive manner. The mutation of RagA ubiquitination sites abolishes this effect of RNF152 and enhances the RagA-mediated activation of mTORC1. Ubiquitination by RNF152 generates an anchor on RagA to recruit its inhibitor GATOR1, a GAP complex for Rag GTPases. RNF152 knockout results in the hyperactivation of mTORC1 and protects cells from amino-acid-starvation-induced autophagy. Thus, this study reveals a mechanism for regulation of mTORC1 signaling by RNF152-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of RagA.

Abstract: Summary
The size of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) is remarkably uniform, suggesting that it is optimized to achieve the appropriate levels of cargo and lipid internalization. The three most abundant proteins in mammalian endocytic CCVs are clathrin and the two cargo-selecting, clathrin adaptors, CALM and AP2. Here we demonstrate that depletion of CALM causes a substantial increase in the ratio of “open” clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) to “necked”/“closed” CCVs and a doubling of CCP/CCV diameter, whereas AP2 depletion has opposite effects. Depletion of either adaptor, however, significantly inhibits endocytosis of transferrin and epidermal growth factor. The phenotypic effects of CALM depletion can be rescued by re-expression of wild-type CALM, but not with CALM that lacks a functional N-terminal, membrane-inserting, curvature-sensing/driving amphipathic helix, the existence and properties of which are demonstrated. CALM is thus a major factor in controlling CCV size and maturation and hence in determining the rates of endocytic cargo uptake.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR/Cas9 technology of genome editing has greatly facilitated the targeted inactivation of genes in vitro and in vivo in a wide range of organisms. In zebrafish, it allows the rapid generation of knockout lines by simply injecting a guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA into one-cell stage embryos. Here, we report a simple and scalable CRISPR-based vector system for tissue-specific gene inactivation in zebrafish. As proof of principle, we used our vector with the gata1 promoter driving Cas9 expression to silence the urod gene, implicated in heme biosynthesis, specifically in the erythrocytic lineage. Urod targeting yielded red fluorescent erythrocytes in zebrafish embryos, recapitulating the phenotype observed in the yquem mutant. While F0 embryos displayed mosaic gene disruption, the phenotype appeared very penetrant in stable F1 fish. This vector system constitutes a unique tool to spatially control gene knockout and greatly broadens the scope of loss-of-function studies in zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has been reported to repress and activate transcription by mediating histone H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2 demethylation, respectively. The molecular mechanism that underlies this dual substrate specificity has remained unknown. Here we report that an isoform of LSD1, LSD1+8a, does not have the intrinsic capability to demethylate H3K4me2. Instead, LSD1+8a mediates H3K9me2 demethylation in collaboration with supervillin (SVIL), a new LSD1+8a interacting protein. LSD1+8a knockdown increases H3K9me2, but not H3K4me2, levels at its target promoters and compromises neuronal differentiation. Importantly, SVIL co-localizes to LSD1+8a-bound promoters, and its knockdown mimics the impact of LSD1+8a loss, supporting SVIL as a cofactor for LSD1+8a in neuronal cells. These findings provide insight into mechanisms by which LSD1 mediates H3K9me demethylation and highlight alternative splicing as a means by which LSD1 acquires selective substrate specificities (H3K9 versus H3K4) to differentially control specific gene expression programs in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the key NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme, has two different forms, intra- and extracellular (iNAMPT and eNAMPT), in mammals. However, the significance of eNAMPT secretion remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that deacetylation of iNAMPT by the mammalian NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 predisposes the protein to secretion in adipocytes. NAMPT mutants reveal that SIRT1 deacetylates lysine 53 (K53) and enhances eNAMPT activity and secretion. Adipose tissue-specific Nampt knockout and knockin (ANKO and ANKI) mice show reciprocal changes in circulating eNAMPT, affecting hypothalamic NAD+/SIRT1 signaling and physical activity accordingly. The defect in physical activity observed in ANKO mice is ameliorated by nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Furthermore, administration of a NAMPT-neutralizing antibody decreases hypothalamic NAD+ production, and treating ex vivo hypothalamic explants with purified eNAMPT enhances NAD+, SIRT1 activity, and neural activation. Thus, our findings indicate a critical role of adipose tissue as a modulator for the regulation of NAD+ biosynthesis at a systemic level.

Abstract: By combining conventional single cell analysis with flow cytometry and public database searches with bioinformatics tools, we extended the expression profiling of thymic stromal cotransporter (TSCOT), Slc46A2/Ly110, that was shown to be expressed in bipotent precursor and cortical thymic epithelial cells. Genome scale analysis verified TSCOT expression in thymic tissue- and cell type- specific fashion and is also expressed in some other epithelial tissues including skin and lung. Coexpression profiling with genes, Foxn1 and Hoxa3, revealed the role of TSCOT during the organogenesis. TSCOT expression was detected in all thymic epithelial cells (TECs), but not in the CD31+ endothelial cell lineage in fetal thymus. In addition, ABC transporter-dependent side population and Sca-1+ fetal TEC populations both contain TSCOT-expressing cells, indicating TEC stem cells express TSCOT. TSCOT expression was identified as early as in differentiating embryonic stem cells. TSCOT expression is not under the control of Foxn1 since TSCOT is present in the thymic rudiment of nude mice. By searching variations in the expression levels, TSCOT is positively associated with Grhl3 and Irf6. Cytokines such as IL1b, IL22 and IL24 are the potential regulators of the TSCOT expression. Surprisingly, we found TSCOT expression in the lung is diminished in lung cancers, suggesting TSCOT may be involved in the suppression of lung tumor development. Based on these results, a model for TEC differentiation from the stem cells was proposed in context of multiple epithelial organ formation.

Abstract: Atypical absence epilepsy (AAE) is an intractable disorder characterized by slow spike-and-wave discharges in electroencephalograms (EEGs) and accompanied by severe cognitive dysfunction and neurodevelopmental or neurological deficits in humans. Administration of the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor AY-9944 (AY) during the postnatal developmental period induces AAE in animals; however, the neural mechanism of seizure development remains largely unknown. In this study, we characterized the cellular manifestations of AY-induced AAE in the mouse. Treatment of brain slices with AY increased membrane excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons. AY treatment also increased input resistance of CA1 neurons during early postnatal days (PND) 5–10. However, these effects were not observed during late PND (14–21) or in adulthood (7–10 weeks). Notably, AY treatment elicited paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS)-like epileptiform discharges during the early postnatal period, but not during late PND or in adults. The PDS-like events were not compromised by application of glutamate or GABA receptor antagonists. However, the PDS-like events were abolished by blockage of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Hippocampal neurons isolated from an in vivo AY model of AAE showed similar PDS-like epileptiform discharges. Further, AY-treated neurons from T-type Ca2+ channel α1G knockout (Cav3.1−/−) mice, which do not exhibit typical absence seizures, showed similar PDS-like epileptiform discharges. These results demonstrate that PDS-like epileptiform discharges during the early postnatal period are dependent upon Na+ channels and are involved in the generation of AY-induced AAE, which is distinct from typical absence epilepsy. Our findings may aid our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of clinical AAE in individuals, such as those with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome.

Abstract: Nicotinamide (NAM) has been shown to suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in primary human fibroblasts, thereby extending their replicative lifespan when added to the medium during long-term cultivation. Based on this finding, NAM is hypothesized to affect cellular senescence progression by keeping ROS accumulation low. In the current study, we asked whether NAM is indeed able to reduce ROS levels and senescence phenotypes in cells undergoing senescence progression and those already in senescence. We employed two different cellular models: MCF-7 cells undergoing senescence progression and human fibroblasts in a state of replicative senescence. In both models, NAM treatment substantially decreased ROS levels. In addition, NAM attenuated the expression of the assessed senescence phenotypes, excluding irreversible growth arrest. N-acetyl cysteine, a potent ROS scavenger, did not have comparable effects in the tested cell types. These data show that NAM has potent antioxidative as well as anti-senescent effects. Moreover, these findings suggest that NAM can reduce cellular deterioration caused by oxidative damage in postmitotic cells in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The Zinc-finger protein of the cerebellum 2 (Zic2) is one of the vertebrate homologs of the Drosophila pair-rule gene odd-paired (opa). Our molecular and biochemical studies demonstrate that Zic2 preferentially binds to transcriptional enhancers and is required for the regulation of gene expression in embryonic stem cells. Detailed genome-wide and molecular studies reveal that Zic2 can function with Mbd3/NuRD in regulating the chromatin state and transcriptional output of genes linked to differentiation. Zic2 is required for proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), similar to what has been previously reported for Mbd3/NuRD. Our study identifies Zic2 as a key factor in the execution of transcriptional fine-tuning with Mbd3/NuRD in ESCs through interactions with enhancers. Our study also points to the role of the Zic family of proteins as enhancer-specific binding factors functioning in development.

Abstract: Controlled release of medications remains the most convenient way to deliver drugs. In this study, we precipitated gold nanoparticles with quercetin. We loaded gold-quercetin into poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (NQ) and tested the biological activity of NQ on HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells to acquire the sustained release property. We determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy that NQ effectively caused conformational changes in DNA and modulated different proteins related to epigenetic modifications and c ell cycle control. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage, and caspase 3 activity were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the expression profiles of different anti- and pro-apoptotic as well as epigenetic signals were studied by immunoblotting. A cytotoxicity assay indicated that NQ preferentially killed cancer cells, compared to normal cells. NQ interacted with HepG2 cell DNA and reduced histone deacetylases to control cell proliferation and arrest the cell cycle at the sub-G stage. Activities of cell cycle-related proteins, such as p21WAF, cdk1, and pAkt, were modulated. NQ induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells by activating p53-ROS crosstalk and induces epigenetic modifications leading to inhibited proliferation and cell cycle arrest.

Precise patterns of connectivity are established by different types of afferents on a given target neuron, leading to well-defined and non-overlapping synaptic territories. What regulates the specific characteristics of each type of synapse, in terms of number, morphology, and subcellular localization, remains to be understood. Here, we show that the signaling pathway formed by the secreted complement C1Q-related protein C1QL1 and its receptor, the adhesion-GPCR brain angiogenesis inhibitor 3 (BAI3), controls the stereotyped pattern of connectivity established by excitatory afferents on cerebellar Purkinje cells. The BAI3 receptor modulates synaptogenesis of both parallel fiber and climbing fiber afferents. The restricted and timely expression of its ligand C1QL1 in inferior olivary neurons ensures the establishment of the proper synaptic territory for climbing fibers. Given the broad expression of C1QL and BAI proteins in the developing mouse brain, our study reveals a general mechanism contributing to the formation of a functional brain.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a complex disease comprising diverse subtypes and genetic profiles. Possibly because of the prevalence of genetic alterations activating canonical NF-κB activity, a role for oncogenic lesions that activate the alternative NF-κB pathway in DLBCL has remained elusive. Here, we show that deletion/mutation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of the alternative NF-κB pathway, occurs in ∼15% of DLBCLs and that it often coexists with BCL6 translocation, which prevents terminal B cell differentiation. Accordingly, in a mouse model constitutive activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway cooperates with BCL6 deregulation in DLBCL development. This work demonstrates a key oncogenic role for the alternative NF-κB pathway in DLBCL development.

Abstract: Summary
Several proteins have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), but their molecular function is not completely understood. Here, we used quantitative interaction proteomics to identify binding partners of Amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntingtin (HTT) for Huntington’s disease, Parkin (PARK2) for Parkinson’s disease, and Ataxin-1 (ATXN1) for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. Our network reveals common signatures of protein degradation and misfolding and recapitulates known biology. Toxicity modifier screens and comparison to genome-wide association studies show that interaction partners are significantly linked to disease phenotypes in vivo. Direct comparison of wild-type proteins and disease-associated variants identified binders involved in pathogenesis, highlighting the value of differential interactome mapping. Finally, we show that the mitochondrial protein LRPPRC interacts preferentially with an early-onset AD variant of APP. This interaction appears to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, which is an early phenotype of AD.

Abstract: Summary
Peyer’s patches (PPs) are primary inductive sites of mucosal immunity. Defining PP mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is thus crucial to understand the initiation of mucosal immune response. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenotype, distribution, ontogeny, lifespan, function, and transcriptional profile of PP MPS. We show that monocytes give rise to macrophages and to lysozyme-expressing dendritic cells (LysoDCs), which are both involved in particulate antigen uptake, display strong innate antiviral and antibacterial gene signatures, and, upon TLR7 stimulation, secrete IL-6 and TNF, but neither IL-10 nor IFNγ. However, unlike macrophages, LysoDCs display a rapid renewal rate, strongly express genes of the MHCII presentation pathway, and prime naive helper T cells for IFNγ production. Our results show that monocytes differentiate locally into LysoDCs and macrophages, which display distinct features from their adjacent villus counterparts.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial iron accumulation is a hallmark of diseases associated with impaired iron-sulfur cluster (Fe-S) biogenesis, such as Friedreich ataxia linked to frataxin (FXN) deficiency. The pathophysiological relevance of the mitochondrial iron loading and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using a mouse model of hepatic FXN deficiency in combination with mice deficient for iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), a key regulator of cellular iron metabolism, we show that IRP1 activation in conditions of Fe-S deficiency increases the available cytosolic labile iron pool. Surprisingly, our data indicate that IRP1 activation sustains mitochondrial iron supply and function rather than driving detrimental iron overload. Mitochondrial iron accumulation is shown to depend on mitochondrial dysfunction and heme-dependent upregulation of the mitochondrial iron importer mitoferrin-2. Our results uncover an unexpected protective role of IRP1 in pathological conditions associated with altered Fe-S metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including natural antisense transcripts (NATs), are expressed more extensively than previously anticipated and have widespread roles in regulating gene expression. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of action of the majority of NATs remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a NAT of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1), referred to as Lrp1-AS, that negatively regulates Lrp1 expression. We show that Lrp1-AS directly binds to high-mobility group box 2 (Hmgb2) and inhibits the activity of Hmgb2 to enhance Srebp1a-dependent transcription of Lrp1. Short oligonucleotides targeting Lrp1-AS inhibit the interaction of antisense transcript and Hmgb2 protein and increase Lrp1 expression by enhancing Hmgb2 activity. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of brain tissue samples from Alzheimer’s disease patients and aged-matched controls revealed upregulation of LRP1-AS and downregulation of LRP1. Our data suggest a regulatory mechanism whereby a NAT interacts with a ubiquitous chromatin-associated protein to modulate its activity in a locus-specific fashion.

Abstract: Summary
mTOR senses nutrient and energy status to regulate cell survival and metabolism in response to environmental changes. Surprisingly, targeted mutation of Tsc1, a negative regulator of mTORC1, caused a broad reduction in miRNAs due to Drosha degradation. Conversely, targeted mutation of Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1, increased miRNA biogenesis. mTOR activation increased expression of Mdm2, which is hereby identified as the necessary and sufficient ubiquitin E3 ligase for Drosha. Drosha was induced by nutrient and energy deprivation and conferred resistance to glucose deprivation. Using a high-throughput screen of a miRNA library, we identified four miRNAs that were necessary and sufficient to protect cells against glucose-deprivation-induced apoptosis. These miRNA was regulated by glucose through the mTORC1-MDM2-DROSHA axis. Taken together, our data reveal an mTOR-Mdm2-Drosha pathway in mammalian cells that broadly regulates miRNA biogenesis as a response to alteration in cellular environment.

Abstract: Summary
Hox transcription factors (TFs) are essential for vertebrate development, but how these evolutionary conserved proteins function in vivo remains unclear. Because Hox proteins have notoriously low binding specificity, they are believed to bind with cofactors, mainly homeodomain TFs Pbx and Meis, to select their specific targets. We mapped binding of Meis, Pbx, and Hoxa2 in the branchial arches, a series of segments in the developing vertebrate head. Meis occupancy is largely similar in Hox-positive and -negative arches. Hoxa2, which specifies second arch (IIBA) identity, recognizes a subset of Meis prebound sites that contain Hox motifs. Importantly, at these sites Meis binding is strongly increased. This enhanced Meis binding coincides with active enhancers, which are linked to genes highly expressed in the IIBA and regulated by Hoxa2. These findings show that Hoxa2 operates as a tissue-specific cofactor, enhancing Meis binding to specific sites that provide the IIBA with its anatomical identity.

Abstract: Summary
The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein BRD4 is a validated drug target in leukemia, yet its regulatory function in this disease is not well understood. Here, we show that BRD4 chromatin occupancy in acute myeloid leukemia closely correlates with the hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) PU.1, FLI1, ERG, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and MYB at nucleosome-depleted enhancer and promoter regions. We provide evidence that these TFs, in conjunction with the lysine acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP, facilitate BRD4 recruitment to their occupied sites to promote transcriptional activation. Chemical inhibition of BET bromodomains was found to suppress the functional output of each hematopoietic TF, thereby interfering with essential lineage-specific transcriptional circuits in this disease. These findings reveal a chromatin-based signaling cascade comprised of hematopoietic TFs, p300/CBP, and BRD4 that supports leukemia maintenance and is suppressed by BET bromodomain inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus-driven entrainment of neonatal prefrontal circuits in theta-gamma oscillations contributes to the maturation of cognitive abilities, yet the underlying synaptic mechanisms are still unknown. Here we combine patch-clamp recordings from morphologically and neurochemically characterized layer V pyramidal neurons and interneurons in vivo, with extracellular recordings from the prelimbic cortex (PL) of awake and lightly anesthetized neonatal rats, to elucidate the synaptic framework of early network oscillations. We demonstrate that all neurons spontaneously fire bursts of action potentials. They receive barrages of fast and slow glutamatergic as well as GABAergic synaptic inputs. Oscillatory theta activity results from long-range coupling of pyramidal neurons, presumably within prelimbic-hippocampal circuits, and from local interactions between interneurons. In contrast, beta-low gamma activity requires external glutamatergic drive on prelimbic interneurons. High-frequency oscillations in layer V are independent of interactions at chemical synapses. Thus, specific theta-gamma-modulated synaptic interactions represent the substrate of network oscillations in the developing PL.

Cell Density Sensing Alters TGF-β Signaling in a Cell-Type-Specific Manner, Independent from Hippo Pathway Activation,

Abstract: Summary
Cell-cell contacts inhibit cell growth and proliferation in part by activating the Hippo pathway that drives the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ. Cell density and Hippo signaling have also been reported to block transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) responses, based on the ability of phospho-YAP/TAZ to sequester TGF-β-activated SMAD complexes in the cytoplasm. Herein, we provide evidence that epithelial cell polarization interferes with TGF-β signaling well upstream and independent of cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ. Rather, polarized basolateral presentation of TGF-β receptors I and II deprives apically delivered TGF-β of access to its receptors. Basolateral ligand delivery nonetheless remains entirely effective to induce TGF-β responses. These data demonstrate that cell-type-specific inhibition of TGF-β signaling by cell density is restricted to polarized epithelial cells and reflects the polarized distribution of TGF-β receptors, which thus affects SMAD activation irrespective of Hippo pathway activation.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells in plants and animals are maintained pluripotent by signals from adjacent niche cells. In plants, WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factors are central regulators of stem cell maintenance in different meristem types, yet their molecular mode of action has remained elusive. Here we show that in the Arabidopsis root meristem, the WOX5 protein moves from the root niche organizer, the quiescent center, into the columella stem cells, where it directly represses the transcription factor gene CDF4. This creates a gradient of CDF4 transcription, which promotes differentiation opposite to the WOX5 gradient, allowing stem cell daughter cells to exit the stem cell state. We further show that WOX5 represses CDF4 transcription by recruiting TPL/TPR co-repressors and the histone deacetylase HDA19, which consequently induces histone deacetylation at the CDF4 regulatory region. Our results show that chromatin-mediated repression of differentiation programs is a common strategy in plant and animal stem cell niches.

Abstract: Summary
In the absence of Wnt activation, cytosolic β-catenin is degraded through GSK3/CK1-mediated phosphorylation at the N terminus. Here, we show that, upon Wnt activation, the stability of nuclear β-catenin is regulated via methylation/demethylation. The protein lysine demethylases Kdm2a and Kdm2b regulate the turnover of non-phosphorylated β-catenin specifically within the nucleus via direct interaction with the fourth and fifth armadillo repeats. The lysine residues within this region are required for the methylation of non-phosphorylated β-catenin, which is demethylated by Kdm2a/b and subsequently ubiquitylated. During Xenopus embryogenesis, kdm2a/b genes are transcribed during early embryogenesis and are required for the specification of the body axis. Kdm2a/b knockdown in Xenopus embryos leads to increases in non-phosphorylated and methylated β-catenin, concurrent with the upregulation of β-catenin target genes. This mechanism is required for controlling the output of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to maintain normal cellular functions.

Abstract: This paper presents the process of spermatogenesis in the leech Hirudo troctina Johnson, 1816 using light, fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. At the onset of spermatogenesis in testes, the pear-shaped spermatogonia divide mitotically without full cytokinesis and as a result isogenic groups are formed (clusters, clones) with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 spermatogonia and, finally, 256 primary spermatocytes occur. The final meiotic divisions of spermatocytes give rise to clones with 1024 spermatids. There are hundreds of developing germ-line clones in each testis. In each clone, the male germ cells divide in full synchrony and they are in the same phase of spermatogenesis. During complex spermiogenesis each spermatid becomes a filiform spermatozoon with a helicoid nucleus, which is characterized by the presence of a long acrosome with two regions – anterior and posterior, which are followed by a helicoid nucleus, a midpiece with only one mitochondrion and a long flagellum. Our results were compared to those on other clitellate annelids that have been studied to date, especially to sperm formation in Hirudo medicinalis Linnaeus, 1785. Only minor differences were found in the length and the diameter of different organelles and the number of spermatids in germ-line clones.

Abstract: Yeast has proven to be a powerful tool to elucidate the molecular aspects of several biological processes in higher eukaryotes. As in mammalian cells, yeast intracellular Ca2+ signalling is crucial for a myriad of biological processes. Yeast cells also bear homologs of the major components of the Ca2+ signalling toolkit in mammalian cells, including channels, co-transporters and pumps. Using yeast single- and multiple-gene deletion strains of various plasma membrane and organellar Ca2+ transporters, combined with manipulations to estimate intracellular Ca2+ storage, we evaluated the contribution of individual transport systems to intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Yeast strains lacking Pmr1 and/or Cod1, two ion pumps implicated in ER/Golgi Ca2+ homeostasis, displayed a fragmented vacuolar phenotype and showed increased vacuolar Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. In the pmr1Δ strain, these effects were insensitive to calcineurin activity, independent of Cch1/Mid1 Ca2+ channels and Pmc1 but required Vcx1. By contrast, in the cod1Δ strain increased vacuolar Ca2+ uptake was not affected by Vcx1 deletion but was largely dependent on Pmc1 activity. Our analysis further corroborates the distinct roles of Vcx1 and Pmc1 in vacuolar Ca2+ uptake and point to the existence of not-yet identified Ca2+ influx pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The BH4 domain of Bcl2 is required for its antiapoptotic function, thus constituting a promising anticancer target. We identified a small-molecule Bcl2-BH4 domain antagonist, BDA-366, that binds BH4 with high affinity and selectivity. BDA-366-Bcl2 binding induces conformational change in Bcl2 that abrogates its antiapoptotic function, converting it from a survival molecule to a cell death inducer. BDA-366 suppresses growth of lung cancer xenografts derived from cell lines and patient without significant normal tissue toxicity at effective doses. mTOR inhibition upregulates Bcl2 in lung cancer cells and tumor tissues from clinical trial patients. Combined BDA-366 and RAD001 treatment exhibits strong synergy against lung cancer in vivo. Development of this Bcl2-BH4 antagonist may provide a strategy to improve lung cancer outcome.

Abstract: Summary
N-myristoylation is an essential fatty acid modification that governs the localization and activity of cell signaling enzymes, architectural proteins, and immune regulatory factors. Despite its importance in health and disease, there are currently no methods for reversing protein myristoylation in vivo. Recently, the Shigella flexneri protease IpaJ was found to cleave myristoylated glycine of eukaryotic proteins, yet the discriminatory mechanisms of substrate selection required for targeted demyristoylation have not yet been evaluated. Here, we performed global myristoylome profiling of cells treated with IpaJ under distinct physiological conditions. The protease is highly promiscuous among diverse N-myristoylated proteins in vitro but is remarkably specific to Golgi-associated ARF/ARL family GTPases during Shigella infection. Reconstitution studies revealed a mechanistic framework for substrate discrimination based on IpaJ’s function as a GTPase “effector” of bacterial origin. We now propose a concerted model for IpaJ function that highlights its potential for programmable demyristoylation in vivo.

Abstract: Intake of caffeine during pregnancy can cause retardation of fetal development. Although the significant influence of caffeine on animal development is widely recognized, much remains unknown about its mode of action because of its pleiotropic effects on living organisms. In the present study, by using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, the effects of caffeine on development were examined. Brood size, embryonic lethality, and percent larval development were investigated, and caffeine was found to inhibit the development of C. elegans at most of the stages in a dosage-dependent fashion. Upon treatment with 30 mM caffeine, the majority (86.1 ± 3.4%) of the L1 larvae were irreversibly arrested without further development. In contrast, many of the late-stage larvae survived and grew to adults when exposed to the same 30 mM caffeine. These results suggest that early-stage larvae are more susceptible to caffeine than later-stage larvae. To understand the metabolic responses to caffeine treatment, the levels of expression of cytochrome P450 (cyp) genes were examined with or without caffeine treatment using comparative micro-array, and it was found that the expression of 24 cyp genes was increased by more than 2-fold (p < 0.05). Among them, induction of the cyp-35A gene family was the most prominent. Interestingly, depletion of the cyp-35A family genes one-by-one or in combination through RNA interference resulted in partial rescue from early larval developmental arrest caused by caffeine treatment, suggesting that the high-level induction of cyp-35A family genes can be fatal to the development of early-stage larvae.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) pathway is required in endothelial cells for normal cardiovascular development and to prevent postnatal vascular malformations, but its molecular effectors are not well defined. Here we show that loss of CCM signaling in endocardial cells results in mid-gestation heart failure associated with premature degradation of cardiac jelly. CCM deficiency dramatically alters endocardial and endothelial gene expression, including increased expression of the Klf2 and Klf4 transcription factors and the Adamts4 and Adamts5 proteases that degrade cardiac jelly. These changes in gene expression result from increased activity of MEKK3, a mitogen-activated protein kinase that binds CCM2 in endothelial cells. MEKK3 is both necessary and sufficient for expression of these genes, and partial loss of MEKK3 rescues cardiac defects in CCM-deficient embryos. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which CCM signaling controls endothelial gene expression during cardiovascular development that may also underlie CCM formation.

Abstract: Summary
The activities of many DNA-repair proteins are controlled through reversible covalent modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules. Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the predominant DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammalian cells and is initiated by DSB ends being recognized by the Ku70/Ku80 (Ku) heterodimer. By using MLN4924, an anti-cancer drug in clinical trials that specifically inhibits conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8, to target proteins, we demonstrate that NEDD8 accumulation at DNA-damage sites is a highly dynamic process. In addition, we show that depleting cells of the NEDD8 E2-conjugating enzyme, UBE2M, yields ionizing radiation hypersensitivity and reduced cell survival following NHEJ. Finally, we demonstrate that neddylation promotes Ku ubiquitylation after DNA damage and release of Ku and Ku-associated proteins from damage sites following repair. These studies provide insights into how the NHEJ core complex dissociates from repair sites and highlight its importance for cell survival following DSB induction.

Abstract: Summary
Most cases of adult myeloid neoplasms are routinely assumed to be sporadic. Here, we describe an adult familial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) syndrome caused by germline mutations in the DEAD/H-box helicase gene DDX41. DDX41 was also found to be affected by somatic mutations in sporadic cases of myeloid neoplasms as well as in a biallelic fashion in 50% of patients with germline DDX41 mutations. Moreover, corresponding deletions on 5q35.3 present in 6% of cases led to haploinsufficient DDX41 expression. DDX41 lesions caused altered pre-mRNA splicing and RNA processing. DDX41 is exemplary of other RNA helicase genes also affected by somatic mutations, suggesting that they constitute a family of tumor suppressor genes.

Abstract: Summary
Memory is thought to be stored in the brain as an ensemble of cells activated during learning. Although optical stimulation of a cell ensemble triggers the retrieval of the corresponding memory, it is unclear how the association of information occurs at the cell ensemble level. Using optogenetic stimulation without any sensory input in mice, we found that an artificial association between stored, non-related contextual, and fear information was generated through the synchronous activation of distinct cell ensembles corresponding to the stored information. This artificial association shared characteristics with physiologically associated memories, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity and protein synthesis dependence. These findings suggest that the association of information is achieved through the synchronous activity of distinct cell ensembles. This mechanism may underlie memory updating by incorporating novel information into pre-existing networks to form qualitatively new memories.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a vital proteolytic pathway required for cell homeostasis. However, the turnover mechanism of the proteasome subunit itself is still not understood. Here, we show that the 20S proteasome subunit PSMA7 is subjected to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which was suppressed by PSMA7 phosphorylation at Y106 mediated by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases c-Abl/Arg. BRCA1 specifically functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of PSMA7 ubiquitination. c-Abl/Arg regulates cellular proteasome abundance by controlling the PSMA7 subunit supply. Downregulated PSMA7 level results in decreased proteasome abundance in c-Abl/Arg RNAi-knockdown or c-abl/arg-deficient cells, which demonstrated an increased sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. In response to oxidative stress, the c-Abl-mediated upregulation of proteasome level compensates for the proteasomal activity impairment induced by reactive oxygen species. Abl-kinases-regulated biogenesis and homeostasis of proteasome complexes may be important for understanding related diseases and pathological states.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular pathways regulating the development of arterial and venous endothelial cells (ECs) are now well established, but control of parallel arterial-venous alignment is unclear. Here we report that arterial-venous alignment in the skin is determined by apelin receptor (APJ) expression in venous ECs. One of the activators of APJ is apelin. We found that apelin is produced by arterial ECs during embryogenesis, induces chemotaxis of venous ECs, and promotes the production of secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) by APJ+ ECs. sFRP1 stimulates matrix metalloproteinase production by Ly6B.2+ neutrophil-like cells located between the arteries and veins, resulting in remodeling of extracellular matrices to support venous displacement. Moreover, using apelin- or APJ-deficient mice, which exhibit arterial-venous disorganization, we found that arterial-venous alignment is involved in thermoregulation, possibly by regulating countercurrent heat exchange. We hypothesize that the evolution of parallel juxtapositional arterial-venous alignment was an adaptation to reduce body heat loss.

Abstract: Piperlongumine, a natural alkaloid isolated from the long pepper, selectively increases reactive oxygen species production and apoptotic cell death in cancer cells but not in normal cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying piperlongumine-induced selective killing of cancer cells remains unclear. In the present study, we observed that human breast cancer MCF-7 cells are sensitive to piperlongumine-induced apoptosis relative to human MCF-10A breast epithelial cells. Interestingly, this opposing effect of piperlongumine appears to be mediated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Piperlongumine upregulated HO-1 expression through the activation of nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) signaling in both MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. However, knockdown of HO-1 expression and pharmacological inhibition of its activity abolished the ability of piperlongumine to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, whereas those promoted apoptosis in MCF-10A cells, indicating that HO-1 has anti-tumor functions in cancer cells but cytoprotective functions in normal cells. Moreover, it was found that piperlongumine-induced Nrf2 activation, HO-1 expression and cancer cell apoptosis are not dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species. Instead, piperlongumine, which bears electrophilic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups, appears to inactivate Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) through thiol modification, thereby activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and subsequently upregulating HO-1 expression, which accounts for piperlongumine-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that direct interaction of piperlongumine with Keap1 leads to the upregulation of Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression, and HO-1 determines the differential response of breast normal cells and cancer cells to piperlongumine.

Abstract: This study deals with the structure of the digestive gland of the carnivorous gastropod Adelomelon beckii in Mar del Plata area (Argentina) and discusses the function of its cell types and compare with other gastropods. According to histological and transmission electron microscopy observations the epithelium is composed of two types of cells that are subject to cyclical changes, involving three phases: absorption, digestion and fragmentation. The majority of the cells, called digestive cells, have a basal nucleus with a cytoplasm filled by spherical digestive vesicles in different stages. The apical pole of the cell is covered with microvilli and cilia and shows evidence of endocytotic activity during the absorption phase. The intracellular digestive process passes through: (1) fusion of endocytotic vesicles; (2) transformation in heterolysososmes by fusion with enzyme-rich vesicles; (3) formation of residual bodies after digestion, which are pinched off to the lumen gland during fragmentation phase. The second type of cell in the acini are called vacuolated cells, which occur in clusters, the nucleus is in the mid-basal region and the cytoplasm is basophilic, filled with stacks of RER. During the absorption phase the vacuolated cells secrete neutral mucins that probably serve as lubrication to facilitate transport of food particles. During all phases, a large amount of lipofuscin, an insoluble pigment that is accumulated after lysosome digestion, is accumulated. The functional morphology of the different cell types found in this carnivorous gastropod is very similar to that found in herbivorous and deposit-feeding gastropods, which suggests that the feeding type does not influence the micro-morphology of the digestive gland.

Abstract: Patterning of the polar axis during the early leaf developmental stage is established by cell-to-cell communication between the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and the leaf primordia. In a previous study, we showed that the DRL1 gene, which encodes a homolog of the Elongator-associated protein KTI12 of yeast, acts as a positive regulator of adaxial leaf patterning and shoot meristem activity. To determine the evolutionally conserved functions of DRL1, we performed a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of DRL1 and its yeast homolog, KTI12, and found that while overall homology was low, well-conserved domains were presented. DRL1 contained two conserved plant-specific domains. Expression of the DRL1 gene in a yeast KTI12-deficient yeast mutant suppressed the growth retardation phenotype, but did not rescue the caffeine sensitivity, indicating that the role of Arabidopsis Elongator-associated protein is partially conserved with yeast KTI12, but may have changed between yeast and plants in response to caffeine during the course of evolution. In addition, elevated expression of DRL1 gene triggered zymocin sensitivity, while overexpression of KTI12 maintained zymocin resistance, indicating that the function of Arabidopsis DRL1 may not overlap with yeast KTI12 with regards to toxin sensitivity. In this study, expression analysis showed that class-I KNOX genes were downregulated in the shoot apex, and that YAB and KAN were upregulated in leaves of the Arabidopsis drl1-101 mutant. Our results provide insight into the communication network between the SAM and leaf primordia required for the establishment of leaf polarity by mediating histone acetylation or through other mechanisms.

Abstract: The earliest critical event of pancreatitis is a long lasting high amplitude rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration of the acinar cell, which can be triggered by high concentration of bile acids. Although, Ca2+-release through ryanodine receptors (RyR) is involved in the process, the significance and the exact mechanism of bile acid's action on RyR has not been fully elucidated yet. Therefore, we aimed to test with various techniques and aspects whether bile acids exert a direct effect on RyR and SERCA pump. Our data show that taurocholic acid (TCA)-induced Ca2+ release in pancreatic acinar cells was significantly reduced by the RyR antagonist dantrolene. Further, we show that TCA enhanced RyR's 3H-ryanodine binding and triggered robust Ca2+-release from RyR-enriched vesicles in the pathologically relevant concentration range. RyR single channel current analysis demonstrated that 200μM TCA induced a 5-fold increase in the channel's open probability and caused a significant lengthening of the mean open time. TCA also suppressed Ca2+-uptake rate and ATP-ase activity of SERCA-enriched vesicles, but interestingly, failed to decrease Ca2+ elimination rate in intact cells. Overall, our results strongly suggest that TCA opens RyR by an allosteric mechanism, which contribute significantly to bile acid-induced pathologic Ca2+-leak from the endoplasmic reticulum in pancreatic acinar cells.

Abstract: Summary
Protein synthesis is a major energy-consuming process, which is rapidly repressed upon energy stress by AMPK. How energy deficiency affects translation of mRNAs that cope with the stress response is poorly understood. We found that mitochondrial genes remain translationally active upon energy deprivation. Surprisingly, inhibition of translation is partially retained in AMPKα1/AMPKα2 knockout cells. Mitochondrial mRNAs are enriched with TISU, a translation initiator of short 5′ UTR, which confers resistance specifically to energy stress. Purified 48S preinitiation complex is sufficient for initiation via TISU AUG, when preceded by a short 5′ UTR. eIF1 stimulates TISU but inhibits non-TISU-directed initiation. Remarkably, eIF4GI shares this activity and also interacts with eIF1. Furthermore, eIF4F is released upon 48S formation on TISU. These findings describe a specialized translation tolerance mechanism enabling continuous translation of TISU genes under energy stress and reveal that a key step in start codon selection of short 5′ UTR is eIF4F release.
