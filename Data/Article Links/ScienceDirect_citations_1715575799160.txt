Abstract: Summary
How intestinal microbes regulate metabolic syndrome is incompletely understood. We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells. Sugar and ILC3 promoted outgrowth of Faecalibaculum rodentium that displaced Th17-inducing microbiota. These results define dietary and microbiota factors posing risk for metabolic syndrome. They also define a microbiota-dependent mechanism for immuno-pathogenicity of dietary sugar and highlight an elaborate interaction between diet, microbiota, and intestinal immunity in regulation of metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria encode reverse transcriptases (RTs) of unknown function that are closely related to group II intron-encoded RTs. We found that a Pseudomonas aeruginosa group II intron-like RT (G2L4 RT) with YIDD instead of YADD at its active site functions in DNA repair in its native host and when expressed in Escherichia coli. G2L4 RT has biochemical activities strikingly similar to those of human DNA repair polymerase θ and uses them for translesion DNA synthesis and double-strand break repair (DSBR) via microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). We also found that a group II intron RT can function similarly in DNA repair, with reciprocal active-site substitutions showing isoleucine favors MMEJ and alanine favors primer extension in both enzymes. These DNA repair functions utilize conserved structural features of non-LTR-retroelement RTs, including human LINE-1 and other eukaryotic non-LTR-retrotransposon RTs, suggesting such enzymes may have inherent ability to function in DSBR in a wide range of organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Realizing the full utility of brain organoids to study human development requires understanding whether organoids precisely replicate endogenous cellular and molecular events, particularly since acquisition of cell identity in organoids can be impaired by abnormal metabolic states. We present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic, epigenetic, and spatial atlas of human cortical organoid development, comprising over 610,000 cells, from generation of neural progenitors through production of differentiated neuronal and glial subtypes. We show that processes of cellular diversification correlate closely to endogenous ones, irrespective of metabolic state, empowering the use of this atlas to study human fate specification. We define longitudinal molecular trajectories of cortical cell types during organoid development, identify genes with predicted human-specific roles in lineage establishment, and uncover early transcriptional diversity of human callosal neurons. The findings validate this comprehensive atlas of human corticogenesis in vitro as a resource to prime investigation into the mechanisms of human cortical development.

Abstract: Summary
The perinatal period represents a critical window for cognitive and immune system development, promoted by maternal and infant gut microbiomes and their metabolites. Here, we tracked the co-development of microbiomes and metabolomes from late pregnancy to 1 year of age using longitudinal multi-omics data from a cohort of 70 mother-infant dyads. We discovered large-scale mother-to-infant interspecies transfer of mobile genetic elements, frequently involving genes associated with diet-related adaptations. Infant gut metabolomes were less diverse than maternal but featured hundreds of unique metabolites and microbe-metabolite associations not detected in mothers. Metabolomes and serum cytokine signatures of infants who received regular—but not extensively hydrolyzed—formula were distinct from those of exclusively breastfed infants. Taken together, our integrative analysis expands the concept of vertical transmission of the gut microbiome and provides original insights into the development of maternal and infant microbiomes and metabolomes during late pregnancy and early life.

Abstract: Summary
We present a multiomic cell atlas of human lung development that combines single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing, high-throughput spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell imaging. Coupling single-cell methods with spatial analysis has allowed a comprehensive cellular survey of the epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and erythrocyte/leukocyte compartments from 5–22 post-conception weeks. We identify previously uncharacterized cell states in all compartments. These include developmental-specific secretory progenitors and a subtype of neuroendocrine cell related to human small cell lung cancer. Our datasets are available through our web interface (https://lungcellatlas.org). To illustrate its general utility, we use our cell atlas to generate predictions about cell-cell signaling and transcription factor hierarchies which we rigorously test using organoid models.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) regulates metabolic physiology. However, nearly all mechanistic studies of BAT protein function occur in a single inbred mouse strain, which has limited the understanding of generalizable mechanisms of BAT regulation over physiology. Here, we perform deep quantitative proteomics of BAT across a cohort of 163 genetically defined diversity outbred mice, a model that parallels the genetic and phenotypic variation found in humans. We leverage this diversity to define the functional architecture of the outbred BAT proteome, comprising 10,479 proteins. We assign co-operative functions to 2,578 proteins, enabling systematic discovery of regulators of BAT. We also identify 638 proteins that correlate with protection from, or sensitivity to, at least one parameter of metabolic disease. We use these findings to uncover SFXN5, LETMD1, and ATP1A2 as modulators of BAT thermogenesis or adiposity, and provide OPABAT as a resource for understanding the conserved mechanisms of BAT regulation over metabolic physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have begun to reveal critical roles for the brain’s professional phagocytes, microglia, and their receptors in the control of neurotoxic amyloid beta (Aβ) and myelin debris accumulation in neurodegenerative disease. However, the critical intracellular molecules that orchestrate neuroprotective functions of microglia remain poorly understood. In our studies, we find that targeted deletion of SYK in microglia leads to exacerbated Aβ deposition, aggravated neuropathology, and cognitive defects in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Disruption of SYK signaling in this AD model was further shown to impede the development of disease-associated microglia (DAM), alter AKT/GSK3β-signaling, and restrict Aβ phagocytosis by microglia. Conversely, receptor-mediated activation of SYK limits Aβ load. We also found that SYK critically regulates microglial phagocytosis and DAM acquisition in demyelinating disease. Collectively, these results broaden our understanding of the key innate immune signaling molecules that instruct beneficial microglial functions in response to neurotoxic material.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle regeneration depends on the correct expansion of resident quiescent stem cells (satellite cells), a process that becomes less efficient with aging. Here, we show that mitochondrial dynamics are essential for the successful regenerative capacity of satellite cells. The loss of mitochondrial fission in satellite cells—due to aging or genetic impairment—deregulates the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), leading to inefficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism and mitophagy and increased oxidative stress. This state results in muscle regenerative failure, which is caused by the reduced proliferation and functional loss of satellite cells. Regenerative functions can be restored in fission-impaired or aged satellite cells by the re-establishment of mitochondrial dynamics (by activating fission or preventing fusion), OXPHOS, or mitophagy. Thus, mitochondrial shape and physical networking controls stem cell regenerative functions by regulating metabolism and proteostasis. As mitochondrial fission occurs less frequently in the satellite cells in older humans, our findings have implications for regeneration therapies in sarcopenia.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroepithelial crosstalk is critical for gut physiology. However, the mechanisms by which sensory neurons communicate with epithelial cells to mediate gut barrier protection at homeostasis and during inflammation are not well understood. Here, we find that Nav1.8+CGRP+ nociceptor neurons are juxtaposed with and signal to intestinal goblet cells to drive mucus secretion and gut protection. Nociceptor ablation led to decreased mucus thickness and dysbiosis, while chemogenetic nociceptor activation or capsaicin treatment induced mucus growth. Mouse and human goblet cells expressed Ramp1, receptor for the neuropeptide CGRP. Nociceptors signal via the CGRP-Ramp1 pathway to induce rapid goblet cell emptying and mucus secretion. Notably, commensal microbes activated nociceptors to control homeostatic CGRP release. In the absence of nociceptors or epithelial Ramp1, mice showed increased epithelial stress and susceptibility to colitis. Conversely, CGRP administration protected nociceptor-ablated mice against colitis. Our findings demonstrate a neuron-goblet cell axis that orchestrates gut mucosal barrier protection.

Abstract: Summary
Natural and induced somatic mutations that accumulate in the genome during development record the phylogenetic relationships of cells; whether these lineage barcodes capture the complex dynamics of progenitor states remains unclear. We introduce quantitative fate mapping, an approach to reconstruct the hierarchy, commitment times, population sizes, and commitment biases of intermediate progenitor states during development based on a time-scaled phylogeny of their descendants. To reconstruct time-scaled phylogenies from lineage barcodes, we introduce Phylotime, a scalable maximum likelihood clustering approach based on a general barcoding mutagenesis model. We validate these approaches using realistic in silico and in vitro barcoding experiments. We further establish criteria for the number of cells that must be analyzed for robust quantitative fate mapping and a progenitor state coverage statistic to assess the robustness. This work demonstrates how lineage barcodes, natural or synthetic, enable analyzing progenitor fate and dynamics long after embryonic development in any organism.

Abstract: Summary
Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) convert the stochastic choice of one of >1,000 olfactory receptor (OR) genes into precise and stereotyped axon targeting of OR-specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, we show that the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates both the glomerular coalescence of like axons and the specificity of their projections. Subtle differences in OR protein sequences lead to distinct patterns of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during OSN development, converting OR identity into distinct gene expression signatures. We identify the transcription factor Ddit3 as a key effector of PERK signaling that maps OR-dependent ER stress patterns to the transcriptional regulation of axon guidance and cell-adhesion genes, instructing targeting precision. Our results extend the known functions of the UPR from a quality-control pathway that protects cells from misfolded proteins to a sensor of cellular identity that interprets physiological states to direct axon wiring.

Abstract: Summary
Although disrupted bile acid (BA) homeostasis is implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the role of hepatic BA metabolism in the pathogenesis of colitis is poorly understood. Here, we found that cholic acid (CA) levels were increased in patients and mice. Cytochrome P450 8B1 (CYP8B1), which synthesizes CA, was induced in livers of colitic mice. CA-treated or liver Cyp8b1-overexpressing mice developed more severe colitis with compromised repair of the mucosal barrier, whereas Cyp8b1-knockout mice were resistant to colitis. Mechanistically, CA inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), resulting in impeded fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and impaired Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell (ISC) renewal. A PPARα agonist restored FAO and improved Lgr5+ ISC function. Activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) suppressed liver CYP8B1 expression and ameliorated colitis in mice. This study reveals a connection between the hepatic CYP8B1-CA axis and colitis via regulating intestinal epithelial regeneration, suggesting that BA-based strategies might be beneficial in IBD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Some people are more attractive to mosquitoes than others, but the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We tested mosquito attraction to human skin odor and identified people who are exceptionally attractive or unattractive to mosquitoes. These differences were stable over several years. Chemical analysis revealed that highly attractive people produce significantly more carboxylic acids in their skin emanations. Mutant mosquitoes lacking the chemosensory co-receptors Ir8a, Ir25a, or Ir76b were severely impaired in attraction to human scent, but retained the ability to differentiate highly and weakly attractive people. The link between elevated carboxylic acids in “mosquito-magnet” human skin odor and phenotypes of genetic mutations in carboxylic acid receptors suggests that such compounds contribute to differential mosquito attraction. Understanding why some humans are more attractive than others provides insights into what skin odorants are most important to the mosquito and could inform the development of more effective repellents.

Abstract: Summary
Searches for the genetic underpinnings of uniquely human traits have focused on human-specific divergence in conserved genomic regions, which reflects adaptive modifications of existing functional elements. However, the study of conserved regions excludes functional elements that descended from previously neutral regions. Here, we demonstrate that the fastest-evolved regions of the human genome, which we term “human ancestor quickly evolved regions” (HAQERs), rapidly diverged in an episodic burst of directional positive selection prior to the human-Neanderthal split, before transitioning to constraint within hominins. HAQERs are enriched for bivalent chromatin states, particularly in gastrointestinal and neurodevelopmental tissues, and genetic variants linked to neurodevelopmental disease. We developed a multiplex, single-cell in vivo enhancer assay to discover that rapid sequence divergence in HAQERs generated hominin-unique enhancers in the developing cerebral cortex. We propose that a lack of pleiotropic constraints and elevated mutation rates poised HAQERs for rapid adaptation and subsequent susceptibility to disease.

Abstract: Summary
Direct reprogramming has revolutionized the fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. However, the common mechanisms governing how reprogramming cells undergo transcriptome and epigenome remodeling (i.e., regulatome remodeling) have not been investigated. Here, by characterizing early changes in the regulatome of three different types of direct reprogramming, we identify lineage-specific features as well as common regulatory transcription factors. Of particular interest, we discover that the neuronal factor Ascl1 possesses cross-lineage potential; together with Mef2c, it drives efficient cardiac reprogramming toward a mature and induced cardiomyocyte phenotype. Through ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, we find that MEF2C drives the shift in ASCL1 binding away from neuronal genes toward cardiac genes, guiding their co-operative epigenetic and transcription activities. Together, these findings demonstrate the existence of common regulators of different direct reprogramming and argue against the premise that transcription factors possess only lineage-specific capabilities for altering cell fate – the basic premise used to develop direct reprogramming approaches.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA booster vaccines provide protection from severe disease, eliciting strong immunity that is further boosted by previous infection. However, it is unclear whether these immune responses are affected by the interval between infection and vaccination. Over a 2-month period, we evaluated antibody and B cell responses to a third-dose mRNA vaccine in 66 individuals with different infection histories. Uninfected and post-boost but not previously infected individuals mounted robust ancestral and variant spike-binding and neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells. Spike-specific B cell responses from recent infection (<180 days) were elevated at pre-boost but comparatively less so at 60 days post-boost compared with uninfected individuals, and these differences were linked to baseline frequencies of CD27lo B cells. Day 60 to baseline ratio of BCR signaling measured by phosphorylation of Syk was inversely correlated to days between infection and vaccination. Thus, B cell responses to booster vaccines are impeded by recent infection.

Abstract: Summary
The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically causes lung disease but can also disseminate to other tissues. We identified a M. tuberculosis (Mtb) outbreak presenting with unusually high rates of extrapulmonary dissemination and bone disease. We found that the causal strain carried an ancestral full-length version of the type VII-secreted effector EsxM rather than the truncated version present in other modern Mtb lineages. The ancestral EsxM variant exacerbated dissemination through enhancement of macrophage motility, increased egress of macrophages from established granulomas, and alterations in macrophage actin dynamics. Reconstitution of the ancestral version of EsxM in an attenuated modern strain of Mtb altered the migratory mode of infected macrophages, enhancing their motility. In a zebrafish model, full-length EsxM promoted bone disease. The presence of a derived nonsense variant in EsxM throughout the major Mtb lineages 2, 3, and 4 is consistent with a role for EsxM in regulating the extent of dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is the highly conserved process by which proteins are transported along ciliary microtubules by a train-like polymeric assembly of IFT-A and IFT-B complexes. IFT-A is sandwiched between IFT-B and the ciliary membrane, consistent with its putative role in transporting transmembrane and membrane-associated cargoes. Here, we have used single-particle analysis electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of native IFT-A complexes. We show that subcomplex rearrangements enable IFT-A to polymerize laterally on anterograde IFT trains, revealing a cooperative assembly mechanism. Surprisingly, we discover that binding of IFT-A to IFT-B shields the preferred lipid-binding interface from the ciliary membrane but orients an interconnected network of β-propeller domains with the capacity to accommodate diverse cargoes toward the ciliary membrane. This work provides a mechanistic basis for understanding IFT-train assembly and cargo interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in gut microbiota have been associated with several diseases. Here, the International Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Study (iMSMS) studied the gut microbiome of 576 MS patients (36% untreated) and genetically unrelated household healthy controls (1,152 total subjects). We observed a significantly increased proportion of Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Hungatella hathewayi, and Eisenbergiella tayi and decreased Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia species. The phytate degradation pathway was over-represented in untreated MS, while pyruvate-producing carbohydrate metabolism pathways were significantly reduced. Microbiome composition, function, and derived metabolites also differed in response to disease-modifying treatments. The therapeutic activity of interferon-β may in part be associated with upregulation of short-chain fatty acid transporters. Distinct microbial networks were observed in untreated MS and healthy controls. These results strongly support specific gut microbiome associations with MS risk, course and progression, and functional changes in response to treatment.

Abstract: Summary
To track and control self-location, animals integrate their movements through space. Representations of self-location are observed in the mammalian hippocampal formation, but it is unknown if positional representations exist in more ancient brain regions, how they arise from integrated self-motion, and by what pathways they control locomotion. Here, in a head-fixed, fictive-swimming, virtual-reality preparation, we exposed larval zebrafish to a variety of involuntary displacements. They tracked these displacements and, many seconds later, moved toward their earlier location through corrective swimming (“positional homeostasis”). Whole-brain functional imaging revealed a network in the medulla that stores a memory of location and induces an error signal in the inferior olive to drive future corrective swimming. Optogenetically manipulating medullary integrator cells evoked displacement-memory behavior. Ablating them, or downstream olivary neurons, abolished displacement corrections. These results reveal a multiregional hindbrain circuit in vertebrates that integrates self-motion and stores self-location to control locomotor behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Adult mammalian skin wounds heal by forming fibrotic scars. We report that full-thickness injuries of reindeer antler skin (velvet) regenerate, whereas back skin forms fibrotic scar. Single-cell multi-omics reveal that uninjured velvet fibroblasts resemble human fetal fibroblasts, whereas back skin fibroblasts express inflammatory mediators mimicking pro-fibrotic adult human and rodent fibroblasts. Consequently, injury elicits site-specific immune responses: back skin fibroblasts amplify myeloid infiltration and maturation during repair, whereas velvet fibroblasts adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype that restricts leukocyte recruitment and hastens immune resolution. Ectopic transplantation of velvet to scar-forming back skin is initially regenerative, but progressively transitions to a fibrotic phenotype akin to the scarless fetal-to-scar-forming transition reported in humans. Skin regeneration is diminished by intensifying, or enhanced by neutralizing, these pathologic fibroblast-immune interactions. Reindeer represent a powerful comparative model for interrogating divergent wound healing outcomes, and our results nominate decoupling of fibroblast-immune interactions as a promising approach to mitigate scar.

Abstract: Summary
Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection results in neurodevelopmental deficits in up to 14% of infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers. Neutralizing antibodies are a critical component of protective immunity. Here, we demonstrate that plasma IgM contributes to ZIKV immunity in pregnancy, mediating neutralization up to 3 months post-symptoms. From a ZIKV-infected pregnant woman, we isolated a pentameric ZIKV-specific IgM (DH1017.IgM) that exhibited ultrapotent ZIKV neutralization dependent on the IgM isotype. DH1017.IgM targets an envelope dimer epitope within domain II. The epitope arrangement on the virion is compatible with concurrent engagement of all ten antigen-binding sites of DH1017.IgM, a solution not available to IgG. DH1017.IgM protected mice against viremia upon lethal ZIKV challenge more efficiently than when expressed as an IgG. Our findings identify a role for antibodies of the IgM isotype in protection against ZIKV and posit DH1017.IgM as a safe and effective candidate immunotherapeutic, particularly during pregnancy.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic cancer vaccines are designed to increase tumor-specific T cell immunity. However, suppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may limit T cell function. Here, we assessed how the route of vaccination alters intratumoral myeloid cells. Using a self-assembling nanoparticle vaccine that links tumor antigen peptides to a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist (SNP-7/8a), we treated tumor-bearing mice subcutaneously (SNP-SC) or intravenously (SNP-IV). Both routes generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that infiltrated tumors. However, only SNP-IV mediated tumor regression, dependent on systemic type I interferon at the time of boost. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that intratumoral monocytes expressing an immunoregulatory gene signature (Chil3, Anxa2, Wfdc17) were reduced after SNP-IV boost. In humans, the Chil3+ monocyte gene signature is enriched in CD16– monocytes and associated with worse outcomes. Our results show that the generation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells combined with remodeling of the TME is a promising approach for tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic studies have highlighted microglia as pivotal in orchestrating Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Microglia that adhere to Aβ plaques acquire a transcriptional signature, “disease-associated microglia” (DAM), which largely emanates from the TREM2-DAP12 receptor complex that transmits intracellular signals through the protein tyrosine kinase SYK. The human TREM2R47H variant associated with high AD risk fails to activate microglia via SYK. We found that SYK-deficient microglia cannot encase Aβ plaques, accelerating brain pathology and behavioral deficits. SYK deficiency impaired the PI3K-AKT-GSK-3β-mTOR pathway, incapacitating anabolic support required for attaining the DAM profile. However, SYK-deficient microglia proliferated and advanced to an Apoe-expressing prodromal stage of DAM; this pathway relied on the adapter DAP10, which also binds TREM2. Thus, microglial responses to Aβ involve non-redundant SYK- and DAP10-pathways. Systemic administration of an antibody against CLEC7A, a receptor that directly activates SYK, rescued microglia activation in mice expressing the TREM2R47H allele, unveiling new options for AD immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The cardiomyocyte (CM) subtypes in the mammalian heart derive from distinct lineages known as the first heart field (FHF), the anterior second heart field (aSHF), and the posterior second heart field (pSHF) lineages that are specified during gastrulation. We modeled human heart field development from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by using single-cell RNA-sequencing to delineate lineage specification and progression. Analyses of hPSC-derived and mouse mesoderm transcriptomes enabled the identification of distinct human FHF, aSHF, and pSHF mesoderm subpopulations. Through staged manipulation of signaling pathways identified from transcriptomics, we generated myocyte populations that display molecular characteristics of key CM subtypes. The developmental trajectory of the human cardiac lineages recapitulated that of the mouse, demonstrating conserved cardiovascular programs. These findings establish a comprehensive landscape of human embryonic cardiogenesis that provides access to a broad spectrum of cardiomyocytes for modeling congenital heart diseases and chamber-specific cardiomyopathies as well as for developing new therapies to treat them.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-microbe associations have been explored for centuries, but cancer-associated fungi have rarely been examined. Here, we comprehensively characterize the cancer mycobiome within 17,401 patient tissue, blood, and plasma samples across 35 cancer types in four independent cohorts. We report fungal DNA and cells at low abundances across many major human cancers, with differences in community compositions that differ among cancer types, even when accounting for technical background. Fungal histological staining of tissue microarrays supported intratumoral presence and frequent spatial association with cancer cells and macrophages. Comparing intratumoral fungal communities with matched bacteriomes and immunomes revealed co-occurring bi-domain ecologies, often with permissive, rather than competitive, microenvironments and distinct immune responses. Clinically focused assessments suggested prognostic and diagnostic capacities of the tissue and plasma mycobiomes, even in stage I cancers, and synergistic predictive performance with bacteriomes.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are a powerful tool for studying development and disease, but the considerable phenotypic variation between lines makes it challenging to replicate key findings and integrate data across research groups. To address this issue, we sub-cloned candidate human iPSC lines and deeply characterized their genetic properties using whole genome sequencing, their genomic stability upon CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing, and their phenotypic properties including differentiation to commonly used cell types. These studies identified KOLF2.1J as an all-around well-performing iPSC line. We then shared KOLF2.1J with groups around the world who tested its performance in head-to-head comparisons with their own preferred iPSC lines across a diverse range of differentiation protocols and functional assays. On the strength of these findings, we have made KOLF2.1J and its gene-edited derivative clones readily accessible to promote the standardization required for large-scale collaborative science in the stem cell field.

Abstract: Summary
Mucus protects the epithelial cells of the digestive and respiratory tracts from pathogens and other hazards. Progress in determining the molecular mechanisms of mucus barrier function has been limited by the lack of high-resolution structural information on mucins, the giant, secreted, gel-forming glycoproteins that are the major constituents of mucus. Here, we report how mucin structures we determined enabled the discovery of an unanticipated protective role of mucus: managing the toxic transition metal copper. Using two juxtaposed copper binding sites, one for Cu2+ and the other for Cu1+, the intestinal mucin, MUC2, prevents copper toxicity by blocking futile redox cycling and the squandering of dietary antioxidants, while nevertheless permitting uptake of this important trace metal into cells. These findings emphasize the value of molecular structure in advancing mucosal biology, while introducing mucins, produced in massive quantities to guard extensive mucosal surfaces, as extracellular copper chaperones.

Abstract: Summary
Efforts to model the human gut microbiome in mice have led to important insights into the mechanisms of host-microbe interactions. However, the model communities studied to date have been defined or complex, but not both, limiting their utility. Here, we construct and characterize in vitro a defined community of 104 bacterial species composed of the most common taxa from the human gut microbiota (hCom1). We then used an iterative experimental process to fill open niches: germ-free mice were colonized with hCom1 and then challenged with a human fecal sample. We identified new species that engrafted following fecal challenge and added them to hCom1, yielding hCom2. In gnotobiotic mice, hCom2 exhibited increased stability to fecal challenge and robust colonization resistance against pathogenic Escherichia coli. Mice colonized by either hCom2 or a human fecal community are phenotypically similar, suggesting that this consortium will enable a mechanistic interrogation of species and genes on microbiome-associated phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Binding of arrestin to phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for modulating signaling. Once internalized, some GPCRs remain complexed with β-arrestins, while others interact only transiently; this difference affects GPCR signaling and recycling. Cell-based and in vitro biophysical assays reveal the role of membrane phosphoinositides (PIPs) in β-arrestin recruitment and GPCR-β-arrestin complex dynamics. We find that GPCRs broadly stratify into two groups, one that requires PIP binding for β-arrestin recruitment and one that does not. Plasma membrane PIPs potentiate an active conformation of β-arrestin and stabilize GPCR-β-arrestin complexes by promoting a fully engaged state of the complex. As allosteric modulators of GPCR-β-arrestin complex dynamics, membrane PIPs allow for additional conformational diversity beyond that imposed by GPCR phosphorylation alone. For GPCRs that require membrane PIP binding for β-arrestin recruitment, this provides a mechanism for β-arrestin release upon translocation of the GPCR to endosomes, allowing for its rapid recycling.

Abstract: Summary
Nociceptive pain is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); however, whether pain-sensing neurons influence intestinal inflammation remains poorly defined. Employing chemogenetic silencing, adenoviral-mediated colon-specific silencing, and pharmacological ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors, we observed more severe inflammation and defective tissue-protective reparative processes in a murine model of intestinal damage and inflammation. Disrupted nociception led to significant alterations in the intestinal microbiota and a transmissible dysbiosis, while mono-colonization of germ-free mice with Gram+ Clostridium spp. promoted intestinal tissue protection through a nociceptor-dependent pathway. Mechanistically, disruption of nociception resulted in decreased levels of substance P, and therapeutic delivery of substance P promoted tissue-protective effects exerted by TRPV1+ nociceptors in a microbiota-dependent manner. Finally, dysregulated nociceptor gene expression was observed in intestinal biopsies from IBD patients. Collectively, these findings indicate an evolutionarily conserved functional link between nociception, the intestinal microbiota, and the restoration of intestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Opposing roles have been proposed for IL-22 in intestinal pathophysiology. We have optimized human small intestinal organoid (hSIO) culturing, constitutively generating all differentiated cell types while maintaining an active stem cell compartment. IL-22 does not promote the expansion of stem cells but rather slows the growth of hSIOs. In hSIOs, IL-22 is required for formation of Paneth cells, the prime producers of intestinal antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Introduction of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated loss-of-function mutations in the IL-22 co-receptor gene IL10RB resulted in abolishment of Paneth cells in hSIOs. Moreover, IL-22 induced expression of host defense genes (such as REG1A, REG1B, and DMBT1) in enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, Tuft cells, and even stem cells. Thus, IL-22 does not directly control the regenerative capacity of crypt stem cells but rather boosts Paneth cell numbers, as well as the expression of AMPs in all cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Simian arteriviruses are endemic in some African primates and can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers when they cross into primate hosts of new species. We find that CD163 acts as an intracellular receptor for simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV; a simian arterivirus), a rare mode of virus entry that is shared with other hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses (e.g., Ebola and Lassa viruses). Further, SHFV enters and replicates in human monocytes, indicating full functionality of all of the human cellular proteins required for viral replication. Thus, simian arteriviruses in nature may not require major adaptations to the human host. Given that at least three distinct simian arteriviruses have caused fatal infections in captive macaques after host-switching, and that humans are immunologically naive to this family of viruses, development of serology tests for human surveillance should be a priority.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial molecular profiling of complex tissues is essential to investigate cellular function in physiological and pathological states. However, methods for molecular analysis of large biological specimens imaged in 3D are lacking. Here, we present DISCO-MS, a technology that combines whole-organ/whole-organism clearing and imaging, deep-learning-based image analysis, robotic tissue extraction, and ultra-high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. DISCO-MS yielded proteome data indistinguishable from uncleared samples in both rodent and human tissues. We used DISCO-MS to investigate microglia activation along axonal tracts after brain injury and characterized early- and late-stage individual amyloid-beta plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. DISCO-bot robotic sample extraction enabled us to study the regional heterogeneity of immune cells in intact mouse bodies and aortic plaques in a complete human heart. DISCO-MS enables unbiased proteome analysis of preclinical and clinical tissues after unbiased imaging of entire specimens in 3D, identifying diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for complex diseases.

Abstract: Summary
During fetal development, human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) colonize the bone marrow (BM), where they self-renew and sustain hematopoiesis throughout life; however, the precise timepoint at which HSCs seed the BM is unclear. We used single-cell RNA-sequencing to map the transcriptomic landscape of human fetal BM and spleen hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their microenvironment from 10 to 14 post-conception weeks (PCWs). We further demonstrated that functional HSCs capable of reconstituting long-term multi-lineage hematopoiesis in adult NOG mice do not emerge in the BM until 12 PCWs. In contrast, functional HSCs were not detected in the spleen by 14 PCWs. By comparing the niche-HSPC interactions between BM and spleen, we identified ligand-receptor pairs likely to be involved in fetal HSC migration and maintenance. Our work paves the way for research into the mechanisms underlying HSC colonization in human fetal BM and provides invaluable resources for future studies on HSC development.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between angiogenesis and neurogenesis regulate embryonic brain development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the stages of vascular cell maturation is lacking, especially in the prenatal human brain. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, single-cell transcriptomics, and histological and ultrastructural analyses, we show that an ensemble of endothelial and mural cell subtypes tile the brain vasculature during the second trimester. These vascular cells follow distinct developmental trajectories and utilize diverse signaling mechanisms, including collagen, laminin, and midkine, to facilitate cell-cell communication and maturation. Interestingly, our results reveal that tip cells, a subtype of endothelial cells, are highly enriched near the ventricular zone, the site of active neurogenesis. Consistent with these observations, prenatal vascular cells transplanted into cortical organoids exhibit restricted lineage potential that favors tip cells, promotes neurogenesis, and reduces cellular stress. Together, our results uncover important mechanisms into vascular maturation during this critical period of human brain development.

Abstract: Summary
The human genome contains hundreds of thousands of regions harboring copy-number variants (CNV). However, the phenotypic effects of most such polymorphisms are unknown because only larger CNVs have been ascertainable from SNP-array data generated by large biobanks. We developed a computational approach leveraging haplotype sharing in biobank cohorts to more sensitively detect CNVs. Applied to UK Biobank, this approach accounted for approximately half of all rare gene inactivation events produced by genomic structural variation. This CNV call set enabled a detailed analysis of associations between CNVs and 56 quantitative traits, identifying 269 independent associations (p < 5 × 10−8) likely to be causally driven by CNVs. Putative target genes were identifiable for nearly half of the loci, enabling insights into dosage sensitivity of these genes and uncovering several gene-trait relationships. These results demonstrate the ability of haplotype-informed analysis to provide insights into the genetic basis of human complex traits.

Abstract: Summary
How the eukaryotic 43S preinitiation complex scans along the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of a capped mRNA to locate the correct start codon remains elusive. Here, we directly track yeast 43S-mRNA binding, scanning, and 60S subunit joining by real-time single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. 43S engagement with mRNA occurs through a slow, ATP-dependent process driven by multiple initiation factors including the helicase eIF4A. Once engaged, 43S scanning occurs rapidly and directionally at ∼100 nucleotides per second, independent of multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis by RNA helicases post ribosomal loading. Scanning ribosomes can proceed through RNA secondary structures, but 5′ UTR hairpin sequences near start codons drive scanning ribosomes at start codons backward in the 5′ direction, requiring rescanning to arrive once more at a start codon. Direct observation of scanning ribosomes provides a mechanistic framework for translational regulation by 5′ UTR structures and upstream near-cognate start codons.

Abstract: Summary
Genotype-phenotype associations for common diseases are often compounded by pleiotropy and metabolic state. Here, we devised a pooled human organoid-panel of steatohepatitis to investigate the impact of metabolic status on genotype-phenotype association. En masse population-based phenotypic analysis under insulin insensitive conditions predicted key non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-genetic factors including the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR)-rs1260326:C>T. Analysis of NASH clinical cohorts revealed that GCKR-rs1260326-T allele elevates disease severity only under diabetic state but protects from fibrosis under non-diabetic states. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, and pharmacological analyses indicate significant mitochondrial dysfunction incurred by GCKR-rs1260326, which was not reversed with metformin. Uncoupling oxidative mechanisms mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction and permitted adaptation to increased fatty acid supply while protecting against oxidant stress, forming a basis for future therapeutic approaches for diabetic NASH. Thus, “in-a-dish” genotype-phenotype association strategies disentangle the opposing roles of metabolic-associated gene variant functions and offer a rich mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic inference toolbox toward precision hepatology.

Abstract: Summary
Selective breeding of domestic dogs has generated diverse breeds often optimized for performing specialized tasks. Despite the heritability of breed-typical behavioral traits, identification of causal loci has proven challenging due to the complexity of canine population structure. We overcome longstanding difficulties in identifying genetic drivers of canine behavior by developing a framework for understanding relationships between breeds and the behaviors that define them, utilizing genetic data for over 4,000 domestic, semi-feral, and wild canids and behavioral survey data for over 46,000 dogs. We identify ten major canine genetic lineages and their behavioral correlates and show that breed diversification is predominantly driven by non-coding regulatory variation. We determine that lineage-associated genes converge in neurodevelopmental co-expression networks, identifying a sheepdog-associated enrichment for interrelated axon guidance functions. This work presents a scaffold for canine diversification that positions the domestic dog as an unparalleled system for revealing the genetic origins of behavioral diversity.

Abstract: Summary
The establishment of in vitro naive human pluripotent stem cell cultures opened new perspectives for the study of early events in human development. The role of several transcription factors and signaling pathways have been characterized during maintenance of human naive pluripotency. However, little is known about the role exerted by the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its three-dimensional (3D) organization. Here, using an unbiased and integrated approach combining microfluidic cultures with transcriptional, proteomic, and secretome analyses, we found that naive, but not primed, hiPSC colonies are characterized by a self-organized ECM-rich microenvironment. Based on this, we developed a 3D culture system that supports robust long-term feeder-free self-renewal of naive hiPSCs and also allows direct and timely developmental morphogenesis simply by modulating the signaling environment. Our study opens new perspectives for future applications of naive hiPSCs to study critical stages of human development in 3D starting from a single cell.

Abstract: Summary
The encoding of touch in the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) and its influence on tactile representations in the brain are poorly understood. Using a range of mechanical stimuli applied to the skin, large-scale in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and genetic manipulations, here we show that neurons in the mouse spinal cord DH receive convergent inputs from both low- and high-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes and exhibit one of six functionally distinct mechanical response profiles. Genetic disruption of DH feedforward or feedback inhibitory motifs, comprised of interneurons with distinct mechanical response profiles, revealed an extensively interconnected DH network that enables dynamic, flexible tuning of postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) output neurons and dictates how neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex respond to touch. Thus, mechanoreceptor subtype convergence and non-linear transformations at the earliest stage of the somatosensory hierarchy shape how touch of the skin is represented in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Human brain development is underpinned by cellular and molecular reconfigurations continuing into the third decade of life. To reveal cell dynamics orchestrating neural maturation, we profiled human prefrontal cortex gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution from gestation to adulthood. Integrative analyses define the dynamic trajectories of each cell type, revealing major gene expression reconfiguration at the prenatal-to-postnatal transition in all cell types followed by continuous reconfiguration into adulthood and identifying regulatory networks guiding cellular developmental programs, states, and functions. We uncover links between expression dynamics and developmental milestones, characterize the diverse timing of when cells acquire adult-like states, and identify molecular convergence from distinct developmental origins. We further reveal cellular dynamics and their regulators implicated in neurological disorders. Finally, using this reference, we benchmark cell identities and maturation states in organoid models. Together, this captures the dynamic regulatory landscape of human cortical development.

Abstract: Summary
Several in vitro models have been developed to recapitulate mouse embryogenesis solely from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Despite mimicking many aspects of early development, they fail to capture the interactions between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed a mouse ESC-based in vitro model that reconstitutes the pluripotent ESC lineage and the two extraembryonic lineages of the post-implantation embryo by transcription-factor-mediated induction. This unified model recapitulates developmental events from embryonic day 5.5 to 8.5, including gastrulation; formation of the anterior-posterior axis, brain, and a beating heart structure; and the development of extraembryonic tissues, including yolk sac and chorion. Comparing single-cell RNA sequencing from individual structures with time-matched natural embryos identified remarkably similar transcriptional programs across lineages but also showed when and where the model diverges from the natural program. Our findings demonstrate an extraordinary plasticity of ESCs to self-organize and generate a whole-embryo-like structure.

Abstract: Summary
Computational analysis of cellular activity has developed largely independently of modern transcriptomic cell typology, but integrating these approaches may be essential for full insight into cellular-level mechanisms underlying brain function and dysfunction. Applying this approach to the habenula (a structure with diverse, intermingled molecular, anatomical, and computational features), we identified encoding of reward-predictive cues and reward outcomes in distinct genetically defined neural populations, including TH+ cells and Tac1+ cells. Data from genetically targeted recordings were used to train an optimized nonlinear dynamical systems model and revealed activity dynamics consistent with a line attractor. High-density, cell-type-specific electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbation provided supporting evidence for this model. Reverse-engineering predicted how Tac1+ cells might integrate reward history, which was complemented by in vivo experimentation. This integrated approach describes a process by which data-driven computational models of population activity can generate and frame actionable hypotheses for cell-type-specific investigation in biological systems.

Abstract: Summary
The concept of senescence as a phenomenon limited to proliferating cells has been challenged by growing evidence of senescence-like features in terminally differentiated cells, including neurons. The persistence of senescent cells late in life is associated with tissue dysfunction and increased risk of age-related disease. We found that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains have significantly higher proportions of neurons that express senescence markers, and their distribution indicates bystander effects. AD patient-derived directly induced neurons (iNs) exhibit strong transcriptomic, epigenetic, and molecular biomarker signatures, indicating a specific human neuronal senescence-like state. AD iN single-cell transcriptomics revealed that senescent-like neurons face oncogenic challenges and metabolic dysfunction as well as display a pro-inflammatory signature. Integrative profiling of the inflammatory secretome of AD iNs and patient cerebral spinal fluid revealed a neuronal senescence-associated secretory phenotype that could trigger astrogliosis in human astrocytes. Finally, we show that targeting senescence-like neurons with senotherapeutics could be a strategy for preventing or treating AD.

Abstract: Summary
Methods for acquiring spatially resolved omics data from complex tissues use barcoded DNA arrays of low- to sub-micrometer features to achieve single-cell resolution. However, fabricating such arrays (randomly assembled beads, DNA nanoballs, or clusters) requires sequencing barcodes in each array, limiting cost-effectiveness and throughput. Here, we describe a vastly scalable stamping method to fabricate polony gels, arrays of ∼1-micrometer clonal DNA clusters bearing unique barcodes. By enabling repeatable enzymatic replication of barcode-patterned gels, this method, compared with the sequencing-dependent array fabrication, reduced cost by at least 35-fold and time to approximately 7 h. The gel stamping was implemented with a simple robotic arm and off-the-shelf reagents. We leveraged the resolution and RNA capture efficiency of polony gels to develop Pixel-seq, a single-cell spatial transcriptomic assay, and applied it to map the mouse parabrachial nucleus and analyze changes in neuropathic pain-regulated transcriptomes and cell-cell communication after nerve ligation.

Abstract: Summary
The current dogma of RNA-mediated innate immunity is that sensing of immunostimulatory RNA ligands is sufficient for the activation of intracellular sensors and induction of interferon (IFN) responses. Here, we report that actin cytoskeleton disturbance primes RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) activation. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement induced by virus infection or commonly used reagents to intracellularly deliver RNA triggers the relocalization of PPP1R12C, a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), from filamentous actin to cytoplasmic RLRs. This allows dephosphorylation-mediated RLR priming and, together with the RNA agonist, induces effective RLR downstream signaling. Genetic ablation of PPP1R12C impairs antiviral responses and enhances susceptibility to infection with several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, picornavirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Our work identifies actin cytoskeleton disturbance as a priming signal for RLR-mediated innate immunity, which may open avenues for antiviral or adjuvant design.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial colonies composed of genetically identical individuals can diversify to yield variant cells with distinct genotypes. Variant outgrowth manifests as sectors. Here, we show that Type VI secretion system (T6SS)-driven cell death in Vibrio cholerae colonies imposes a selective pressure for the emergence of variant strains that can evade T6SS-mediated killing. T6SS-mediated cell death occurs in two distinct spatiotemporal phases, and each phase is driven by a particular T6SS toxin. The first phase is regulated by quorum sensing and drives sectoring. The second phase does not require the T6SS-injection machinery. Variant V. cholerae strains isolated from colony sectors encode mutated quorum-sensing components that confer growth advantages by suppressing T6SS-killing activity while simultaneously boosting T6SS-killing defenses. Our findings show that the T6SS can eliminate sibling cells, suggesting a role in intra-specific antagonism.

Abstract: Summary
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection and death in young infants and the elderly. With no effective prophylactic treatment available, current vaccine candidates aim to elicit neutralizing antibodies. However, binding and neutralization have poorly predicted protection in the past, and accumulating data across epidemiologic cohorts and animal models collectively point to a role for additional antibody Fc-effector functions. To begin to define the humoral correlates of immunity against RSV, here we profiled an adenovirus 26 RSV-preF vaccine-induced humoral immune response in a group of healthy adults that were ultimately challenged with RSV. Protection from infection was linked to opsonophagocytic functions, driven by IgA and differentially glycosylated RSV-specific IgG profiles, marking a functional humoral immune signature of protection against RSV. Furthermore, Fc-modified monoclonal antibodies able to selectively recruit effector functions demonstrated significant antiviral control in a murine model of RSV.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrosis is the final path of nearly every form of chronic disease, regardless of the pathogenesis. Upon chronic injury, activated, fibrogenic fibroblasts deposit excess extracellular matrix, and severe tissue fibrosis can occur in virtually any organ. However, antifibrotic therapies that target fibrogenic cells, while sparing homeostatic fibroblasts in healthy tissues, are limited. We tested whether specific immunization against endogenous proteins, strongly expressed in fibrogenic cells but highly restricted in quiescent fibroblasts, can elicit an antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell response to ameliorate organ fibrosis. In silico epitope prediction revealed that activation of the genes Adam12 and Gli1 in profibrotic cells and the resulting “self-peptides” can be exploited for T cell vaccines to ablate fibrogenic cells. We demonstrate the efficacy of a vaccination approach to mount CD8+ T cell responses that reduce fibroblasts and fibrosis in the liver and lungs in mice. These results provide proof of principle for vaccination-based immunotherapies to treat fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Drug-drug interaction of the antiviral sofosbuvir and the antiarrhythmics amiodarone has been reported to cause fatal heartbeat slowing. Sofosbuvir and its analog, MNI-1, were reported to potentiate the inhibition of cardiomyocyte calcium handling by amiodarone, which functions as a multi-channel antagonist, and implicate its inhibitory effect on L-type Cav channels, but the molecular mechanism has remained unclear. Here we present systematic cryo-EM structural analysis of Cav1.1 and Cav1.3 treated with amiodarone or sofosbuvir alone, or sofosbuvir/MNI-1 combined with amiodarone. Whereas amiodarone alone occupies the dihydropyridine binding site, sofosbuvir is not found in the channel when applied on its own. In the presence of amiodarone, sofosbuvir/MNI-1 is anchored in the central cavity of the pore domain through specific interaction with amiodarone and directly obstructs the ion permeation path. Our study reveals the molecular basis for the physical, pharmacodynamic interaction of two drugs on the scaffold of Cav channels.

Abstract: Summary
Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 signaling transforms cancer therapy and is assumed to unleash exhausted tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, recent studies have also indicated that the systemic tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells may respond to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. These discrepancies highlight the importance of further defining tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Here, using multiple preclinical tumor models, we revealed that a subset of tumor-specific CD8+ cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes (TdLNs) was not functionally exhausted but exhibited canonical memory characteristics. TdLN-derived tumor-specific memory (TTSM) cells established memory-associated epigenetic program early during tumorigenesis. More importantly, TdLN-TTSM cells exhibited superior anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy after adoptive transfer and were characterized as bona fide responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. These findings highlight that TdLN-TTSM cells could be harnessed to potentiate anti-tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular diversity of glia in the human hippocampus and their temporal dynamics over the lifespan remain largely unknown. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to generate a transcriptome atlas of the human hippocampus across the postnatal lifespan. Detailed analyses of astrocytes, oligodendrocyte lineages, and microglia identified subpopulations with distinct molecular signatures and revealed their association with specific physiological functions, age-dependent changes in abundance, and disease relevance. We further characterized spatiotemporal heterogeneity of GFAP-enriched astrocyte subpopulations in the hippocampal formation using immunohistology. Leveraging glial subpopulation classifications as a reference map, we revealed the diversity of glia differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells and identified dysregulated genes and pathological processes in specific glial subpopulations in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Together, our study significantly extends our understanding of human glial diversity, population dynamics across the postnatal lifespan, and dysregulation in AD and provides a reference atlas for stem-cell-based glial differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are channels for nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and RNAs. However, it remains unclear whether composition, structure, and permeability of NPCs dynamically change during the cleavage period of vertebrate embryos and affect embryonic development. Here, we report that the comprehensive NPC maturity (CNM) controls the onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) during zebrafish early embryogenesis. We show that more nucleoporin proteins are recruited to and assembled into NPCs with development, resulting in progressive increase of NPCs in size and complexity. Maternal transcription factors (TFs) transport into nuclei more efficiently with increasing CNM. Deficiency or dysfunction of Nup133 or Ahctf1/Elys impairs NPC assembly, maternal TFs nuclear transport, and ZGA onset, while nup133 overexpression promotes these processes. Therefore, CNM may act as a molecular timer for ZGA by controlling nuclear transport of maternal TFs that reach nuclear concentration thresholds at a given time to initiate ZGA.

Abstract: Summary
We report genome-wide data from 33 Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), dated to the 14th century, obtained following a salvage excavation at the medieval Jewish cemetery of Erfurt, Germany. The Erfurt individuals are genetically similar to modern AJ, but they show more variability in Eastern European-related ancestry than modern AJ. A third of the Erfurt individuals carried a mitochondrial lineage common in modern AJ and eight carried pathogenic variants known to affect AJ today. These observations, together with high levels of runs of homozygosity, suggest that the Erfurt community had already experienced the major reduction in size that affected modern AJ. The Erfurt bottleneck was more severe, implying substructure in medieval AJ. Overall, our results suggest that the AJ founder event and the acquisition of the main sources of ancestry pre-dated the 14th century and highlight late medieval genetic heterogeneity no longer present in modern AJ.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome has an important role in infant health and development. We characterized the fecal microbiome and metabolome of 222 young children in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the first two years of life. A distinct Bifidobacterium longum clade expanded with introduction of solid foods and harbored enzymes for utilizing both breast milk and solid food substrates. The clade was highly prevalent in Bangladesh, present globally (at lower prevalence), and correlated with many other gut taxa and metabolites, indicating an important role in gut ecology. We also found that the B. longum clades and associated metabolites were implicated in childhood diarrhea and early growth, including positive associations between growth measures and B. longum subsp. infantis, indolelactate and N-acetylglutamate. Our data demonstrate geographic, cultural, seasonal, and ecological heterogeneity that should be accounted for when identifying microbiome factors implicated in and potentially benefiting infant development.

Abstract: Summary
In most sensory modalities, neuronal connectivity reflects behaviorally relevant stimulus features, such as spatial location, orientation, and sound frequency. By contrast, the prevailing view in the olfactory cortex, based on the reconstruction of dozens of neurons, is that connectivity is random. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing-based neuroanatomical techniques to analyze the projections of 5,309 mouse olfactory bulb and 30,433 piriform cortex output neurons at single-cell resolution. Surprisingly, statistical analysis of this much larger dataset revealed that the olfactory cortex connectivity is spatially structured. Single olfactory bulb neurons targeting a particular location along the anterior-posterior axis of piriform cortex also project to matched, functionally distinct, extra-piriform targets. Moreover, single neurons from the targeted piriform locus also project to the same matched extra-piriform targets, forming triadic circuit motifs. Thus, as in other sensory modalities, olfactory information is routed at early stages of processing to functionally diverse targets in a coordinated manner.

Abstract: Summary
Although women experience significantly higher tau burden and increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than men, the underlying mechanism for this vulnerability has not been explained. Here, we demonstrate through in vitro and in vivo models, as well as human AD brain tissue, that X-linked ubiquitin specific peptidase 11 (USP11) augments pathological tau aggregation via tau deubiquitination initiated at lysine-281. Removal of ubiquitin provides access for enzymatic tau acetylation at lysines 281 and 274. USP11 escapes complete X-inactivation, and female mice and people both exhibit higher USP11 levels than males. Genetic elimination of usp11 in a tauopathy mouse model preferentially protects females from acetylated tau accumulation, tau pathology, and cognitive impairment. USP11 levels also strongly associate positively with tau pathology in females but not males. Thus, inhibiting USP11-mediated tau deubiquitination may provide an effective therapeutic opportunity to protect women from increased vulnerability to AD and other tauopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Our bodies turn over billions of cells daily via apoptosis and are in turn cleared by phagocytes via the process of “efferocytosis.” Defects in efferocytosis are now linked to various inflammatory diseases. Here, we designed a strategy to boost efferocytosis, denoted “chimeric receptor for efferocytosis” (CHEF). We fused a specific signaling domain within the cytoplasmic adapter protein ELMO1 to the extracellular phosphatidylserine recognition domains of the efferocytic receptors BAI1 or TIM4, generating BELMO and TELMO, respectively. CHEF-expressing phagocytes display a striking increase in efferocytosis. In mouse models of inflammation, BELMO expression attenuates colitis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In mechanistic studies, BELMO increases ER-resident enzymes and chaperones to overcome protein-folding-associated toxicity, which was further validated in a model of ER-stress-induced renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Finally, TELMO introduction after onset of kidney injury significantly reduced fibrosis. Collectively, these data advance a concept of chimeric efferocytic receptors to boost efferocytosis and dampen inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
The communication between glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and the surrounding microenvironment is a prominent feature accounting for the aggressive biology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the mechanisms by which GSCs proactively drive interactions with microenvironment is not well understood. In this study, we interrogated metabolites that are preferentially secreted from GSCs and found that GSCs produce and secrete histamine to shape a pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment. This histamine-producing ability is attributed to H3K4me3 modification-activated histidine decarboxylase (HDC) transcription via MYC. Notably, HDC is highly expressed in GBM, which is associated with poor survival of these patients. GSC-secreted histamine activates endothelial cells by triggering a histamine H1 receptor (H1R)-Ca2+-NF-κB axis, thereby promoting angiogenesis and GBM progression. Importantly, pharmacological blockage of H1R using antihistamines impedes the growth of GBM xenografts in mice. Our findings establish that GSC-specific metabolite secretion remodels the tumor microenvironment and highlight histamine targeting as a potential strategy for GBM therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains a tightly regulated immune system. However, knowledge is lacking about how CSF immunity is altered with aging or neurodegenerative disease. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on CSF from 45 cognitively normal subjects ranging from 54 to 82 years old. We uncovered an upregulation of lipid transport genes in monocytes with age. We then compared this cohort with 14 cognitively impaired subjects. In cognitively impaired subjects, downregulation of lipid transport genes in monocytes occurred concomitantly with altered cytokine signaling to CD8 T cells. Clonal CD8 T effector memory cells upregulated C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) in cognitively impaired subjects. The CXCR6 ligand, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16), was elevated in the CSF of cognitively impaired subjects, suggesting CXCL16-CXCR6 signaling as a mechanism for antigen-specific T cell entry into the brain. Cumulatively, these results reveal cerebrospinal fluid immune dysregulation during healthy brain aging and cognitive impairment.

Abstract: Summary
When challenged by hypertonicity, dehydrated cells must recover their volume to survive. This process requires the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SLC12 cation chloride transporters by WNK kinases, but how these kinases are activated by cell shrinkage remains unknown. Within seconds of cell exposure to hypertonicity, WNK1 concentrates into membraneless condensates, initiating a phosphorylation-dependent signal that drives net ion influx via the SLC12 cotransporters to restore cell volume. WNK1 condensate formation is driven by its intrinsically disordered C terminus, whose evolutionarily conserved signatures are necessary for efficient phase separation and volume recovery. This disorder-encoded phase behavior occurs within physiological constraints and is activated in vivo by molecular crowding rather than changes in cell size. This allows kinase activity despite an inhibitory ionic milieu and permits cell volume recovery through condensate-mediated signal amplification. Thus, WNK kinases are physiological crowding sensors that phase separate to coordinate a cell volume rescue response.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems are host-encoded pathways that protect microbes from viral infection using an adaptive RNA-guided mechanism. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we find that CRISPR systems are also encoded in diverse bacteriophages, where they occur as divergent and hypercompact anti-viral systems. Bacteriophage-encoded CRISPR systems belong to all six known CRISPR-Cas types, though some lack crucial components, suggesting alternate functional roles or host complementation. We describe multiple new Cas9-like proteins and 44 families related to type V CRISPR-Cas systems, including the Casλ RNA-guided nuclease family. Among the most divergent of the new enzymes identified, Casλ recognizes double-stranded DNA using a uniquely structured CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The Casλ-RNA-DNA structure determined by cryoelectron microscopy reveals a compact bilobed architecture capable of inducing genome editing in mammalian, Arabidopsis, and hexaploid wheat cells. These findings reveal a new source of CRISPR-Cas enzymes in phages and highlight their value as genome editors in plant and human cells.

Abstract: Summary
After ingestion of toxin-contaminated food, the brain initiates a series of defensive responses (e.g., nausea, retching, and vomiting). How the brain detects ingested toxin and coordinates diverse defensive responses remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a mouse-based paradigm to study defensive responses induced by bacterial toxins. Using this paradigm, we identified a set of molecularly defined gut-to-brain and brain circuits that jointly mediate toxin-induced defensive responses. The gut-to-brain circuit consists of a subset of Htr3a+ vagal sensory neurons that transmit toxin-related signals from intestinal enterochromaffin cells to Tac1+ neurons in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Tac1+ DVC neurons drive retching-like behavior and conditioned flavor avoidance via divergent projections to the rostral ventral respiratory group and lateral parabrachial nucleus, respectively. Manipulating these circuits also interferes with defensive responses induced by the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin.

Abstract: Summary
The G protein-coupled receptor cascade leading to production of the second messenger cAMP is replete with pharmacologically targetable proteins, with the exception of the Gα subunit, Gαs. GTPases remain largely undruggable given the difficulty of displacing high-affinity guanine nucleotides and the lack of other drug binding sites. We explored a chemical library of 1012 cyclic peptides to expand the chemical search for inhibitors of this enzyme class. We identified two macrocyclic peptides, GN13 and GD20, that antagonize the active and inactive states of Gαs, respectively. Both macrocyclic peptides fine-tune Gαs activity with high nucleotide-binding-state selectivity and G protein class-specificity. Co-crystal structures reveal that GN13 and GD20 distinguish the conformational differences within the switch II/α3 pocket. Cell-permeable analogs of GN13 and GD20 modulate Gαs/Gβγ signaling in cells through binding to crystallographically defined pockets. The discovery of cyclic peptide inhibitors targeting Gαs provides a path for further development of state-dependent GTPase inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental question in bone biology concerns the contributions of skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSCs) in the bone marrow versus the periosteum to bone repair. We found that SSCs in adult bone marrow can be identified based on Leprcre and Adiponectin-cre/creER expression while SSCs in adult periosteum can be identified based on Gli1creERT2 expression. Under steady-state conditions, new bone arose primarily from bone marrow SSCs. After bone injuries, both SSC populations began proliferating but made very different contributions to bone repair. Drill injuries were primarily repaired by LepR+/Adiponectin+ bone marrow SSCs. Conversely, bicortical fractures were primarily repaired by Gli1+ periosteal SSCs, though LepR+/Adiponectin+ bone marrow cells transiently formed trabecular bone at the fracture site. Gli1+ periosteal cells also regenerated LepR+ bone marrow stromal cells that expressed hematopoietic niche factors at fracture sites. Different bone injuries are thus repaired by different SSCs, with periosteal cells regenerating bone and marrow stroma after non-stabilized fractures.

Abstract: Summary
Integrins are validated drug targets with six approved therapeutics. However, small-molecule inhibitors to three integrins failed in late-stage clinical trials for chronic indications. Such unfavorable outcomes may in part be caused by partial agonism, i.e., the stabilization of the high-affinity, extended-open integrin conformation. Here, we show that the failed, small-molecule inhibitors of integrins αIIbβ3 and α4β1 stabilize the high-affinity conformation. Furthermore, we discovered a simple chemical feature present in multiple αIIbβ3 antagonists that stabilizes integrins in their bent-closed conformation. Closing inhibitors contain a polar nitrogen atom that stabilizes, via hydrogen bonds, a water molecule that intervenes between a serine residue and the metal in the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). Expulsion of this water is a requisite for transition to the open conformation. This change in metal coordination is general to integrins, suggesting broad applicability of the drug-design principle to the integrin family, as validated with a distantly related integrin, α4β1.

Abstract: Summary
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains are massive molecular machines that traffic proteins between cilia and the cell body. Each IFT train is a dynamic polymer of two large complexes (IFT-A and -B) and motor proteins, posing a formidable challenge to mechanistic understanding. Here, we reconstituted the complete human IFT-A complex and obtained its structure using cryo-EM. Combined with AlphaFold prediction and genome-editing studies, our results illuminate how IFT-A polymerizes, interacts with IFT-B, and uses an array of β-propeller and TPR domains to create “carriages” of the IFT train that engage TULP adaptor proteins. We show that IFT-A⋅TULP carriages are essential for cilia localization of diverse membrane proteins, as well as ICK—the key kinase regulating IFT train turnaround. These data establish a structural link between IFT-A’s distinct functions, provide a blueprint for IFT-A in the train, and shed light on how IFT evolved from a proto-coatomer ancestor.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism that initiates autophagosome formation on the ER in multicellular organisms is elusive. Here, we showed that autophagy stimuli trigger Ca2+ transients on the outer surface of the ER membrane, whose amplitude, frequency, and duration are controlled by the metazoan-specific ER transmembrane autophagy protein EPG-4/EI24. Persistent Ca2+ transients/oscillations on the cytosolic ER surface in EI24-depleted cells cause accumulation of FIP200 autophagosome initiation complexes on the ER. This defect is suppressed by attenuating ER Ca2+ transients. Multi-modal SIM analysis revealed that Ca2+ transients on the ER trigger the formation of dynamic and fusion-prone liquid-like FIP200 puncta. Starvation-induced Ca2+ transients on lysosomes also induce FIP200 puncta that further move to the ER. Multiple FIP200 puncta on the ER, whose association depends on the ER proteins VAPA/B and ATL2/3, assemble into autophagosome formation sites. Thus, Ca2+ transients are crucial for triggering phase separation of FIP200 to specify autophagosome initiation sites in metazoans.

Abstract: Summary
To define the multi-cellular epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of cardiac cellular development, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility maps of human fetal heart tissues. We identified eight major differentiation trajectories involving primary cardiac cell types, each associated with dynamic transcription factor (TF) activity signatures. We contrasted regulatory landscapes of iPSC-derived cardiac cell types and their in vivo counterparts, which enabled optimization of in vitro differentiation of epicardial cells. Further, we interpreted sequence based deep learning models of cell-type-resolved chromatin accessibility profiles to decipher underlying TF motif lexicons. De novo mutations predicted to affect chromatin accessibility in arterial endothelium were enriched in congenital heart disease (CHD) cases vs. controls. In vitro studies in iPSCs validated the functional impact of identified variation on the predicted developmental cell types. This work thus defines the cell-type-resolved cis-regulatory sequence determinants of heart development and identifies disruption of cell type-specific regulatory elements in CHD.

Abstract: Summary
Decoration of cap on viral RNA plays essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. Here, we report a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping and document structural details at atomic resolution. The NiRAN domain in polymerase catalyzes the covalent link of RNA 5′ end to the first residue of nsp9 (termed as RNAylation), thus being an intermediate to form cap core (GpppA) with GTP catalyzed again by NiRAN. We also reveal that triphosphorylated nucleotide analog inhibitors can be bonded to nsp9 and fit into a previously unknown “Nuc-pocket” in NiRAN, thus inhibiting nsp9 RNAylation and formation of GpppA. S-loop (residues 50-KTN-52) in NiRAN presents a remarkable conformational shift observed in RTC bound with sofosbuvir monophosphate, reasoning an “induce-and-lock” mechanism to design inhibitors. These findings not only improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping and the mode of action of NAIs but also provide a strategy to design antiviral drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Morphine and fentanyl are among the most used opioid drugs that confer analgesia and unwanted side effects through both G protein and arrestin signaling pathways of μ-opioid receptor (μOR). Here, we report structures of the human μOR-G protein complexes bound to morphine and fentanyl, which uncover key differences in how they bind the receptor. We also report structures of μOR bound to TRV130, PZM21, and SR17018, which reveal preferential interactions of these agonists with TM3 side of the ligand-binding pocket rather than TM6/7 side. In contrast, morphine and fentanyl form dual interactions with both TM3 and TM6/7 regions. Mutations at the TM6/7 interface abolish arrestin recruitment of μOR promoted by morphine and fentanyl. Ligands designed to reduce TM6/7 interactions display preferential G protein signaling. Our results provide crucial insights into fentanyl recognition and signaling of μOR, which may facilitate rational design of next-generation analgesics.

Abstract: Summary
The ATP-dependent ring-shaped chaperonin TRiC/CCT is essential for cellular proteostasis. To uncover why some eukaryotic proteins can only fold with TRiC assistance, we reconstituted the folding of β-tubulin using human prefoldin and TRiC. We find unstructured β-tubulin is delivered by prefoldin to the open TRiC chamber followed by ATP-dependent chamber closure. Cryo-EM resolves four near-atomic-resolution structures containing progressively folded β-tubulin intermediates within the closed TRiC chamber, culminating in native tubulin. This substrate folding pathway appears closely guided by site-specific interactions with conserved regions in the TRiC chamber. Initial electrostatic interactions between the TRiC interior wall and both the folded tubulin N domain and its C-terminal E-hook tail establish the native substrate topology, thus enabling C-domain folding. Intrinsically disordered CCT C termini within the chamber promote subsequent folding of tubulin’s core and middle domains and GTP-binding. Thus, TRiC’s chamber provides chemical and topological directives that shape the folding landscape of its obligate substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Population-based studies to identify disease-associated risk alleles typically require samples from a large number of individuals. Here, we report a human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based screening strategy to link human genetics with viral infectivity. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a cluster of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a cis-regulatory region of the NDUFA4 gene, which was associated with susceptibility to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Loss of NDUFA4 led to decreased sensitivity to ZIKV, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Isogenic hiPSC lines carrying non-risk alleles of SNPs or deletion of the cis-regulatory region lower sensitivity to viral infection. Mechanistic studies indicated that loss/reduction of NDUFA4 causes mitochondrial stress, which leads to the leakage of mtDNA and thereby upregulation of type I interferon signaling. This study provides proof-of-principle for the application of iPSC arrays in GWAS and identifies NDUFA4 as a previously unknown susceptibility locus for viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
After the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2, some BA.2 subvariants, including BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5, emerged in multiple countries. Our statistical analysis showed that the effective reproduction numbers of these BA.2 subvariants are greater than that of the original BA.2. Neutralization experiments revealed that the immunity induced by BA.1/2 infections is less effective against BA.4/5. Cell culture experiments showed that BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 replicate more efficiently in human alveolar epithelial cells than BA.2, and particularly, BA.4/5 is more fusogenic than BA.2. We further provided the structure of the BA.4/5 spike receptor-binding domain that binds to human ACE2 and considered how the substitutions in the BA.4/5 spike play roles in ACE2 binding and immune evasion. Moreover, experiments using hamsters suggested that BA.4/5 is more pathogenic than BA.2. Our multiscale investigations suggest that the risk of BA.2 subvariants, particularly BA.4/5, to global health is greater than that of original BA.2.

Abstract: Summary
The target DNA specificity of the CRISPR-associated genome editor nuclease Cas9 is determined by complementarity to a 20-nucleotide segment in its guide RNA. However, Cas9 can bind and cleave partially complementary off-target sequences, which raises safety concerns for its use in clinical applications. Here, we report crystallographic structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target substrates, revealing that off-target binding is enabled by a range of noncanonical base-pairing interactions within the guide:off-target heteroduplex. Off-target substrates containing single-nucleotide deletions relative to the guide RNA are accommodated by base skipping or multiple noncanonical base pairs rather than RNA bulge formation. Finally, PAM-distal mismatches result in duplex unpairing and induce a conformational change in the Cas9 REC lobe that perturbs its conformational activation. Together, these insights provide a structural rationale for the off-target activity of Cas9 and contribute to the improved rational design of guide RNAs and off-target prediction algorithms.

Abstract: Summary
Cells communicate with each other via receptor-ligand interactions. Here, we describe lentiviral-mediated cell entry by engineered receptor-ligand interaction (ENTER) to display ligand proteins, deliver payloads, and record receptor specificity. We optimize ENTER to decode interactions between T cell receptor (TCR)-MHC peptides, antibody-antigen, and other receptor-ligand pairs. A viral presentation strategy allows ENTER to capture interactions between B cell receptor and any antigen. We engineer ENTER to deliver genetic payloads to antigen-specific T or B cells to selectively modulate cellular behavior in mixed populations. Single-cell readout of ENTER by RNA sequencing (ENTER-seq) enables multiplexed enumeration of antigen specificities, TCR clonality, cell type, and states of individual T cells. ENTER-seq of CMV-seropositive patient blood samples reveals the viral epitopes that drive effector memory T cell differentiation and inter-clonal vs. intra-clonal phenotypic diversity targeting the same epitope. ENTER technology enables systematic discovery of receptor specificity, linkage to cell fates, and antigen-specific cargo delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Biochemical processes often require spatial regulation and specific microenvironments. The general lack of organelles in bacteria limits the potential of bioengineering complex intracellular reactions. Here, we demonstrate synthetic membraneless organelles in Escherichia coli termed transcriptionally engineered addressable RNA solvent droplets (TEARS). TEARS are assembled from RNA-binding protein recruiting domains fused to poly-CAG repeats that spontaneously drive liquid-liquid phase separation from the bulk cytoplasm. Targeting TEARS with fluorescent proteins revealed multilayered structures with composition and reaction robustness governed by non-equilibrium dynamics. We show that TEARS provide organelle-like bioprocess isolation for sequestering biochemical pathways, controlling metabolic branch points, buffering mRNA translation rates, and scaffolding protein-protein interactions. We anticipate TEARS to be a simple and versatile tool for spatially controlling E. coli biochemistry. Particularly, the modular design of TEARS enables applications without expression fine-tuning, simplifying the design-build-test cycle of bioengineering.

Abstract: Summary
Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed that elicit immunity directly in the airways as well as systemically. Building on pediatric parainfluenza virus vaccines in clinical development, we generated a live-attenuated parainfluenza-virus-vectored vaccine candidate expressing SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike (S) protein (B/HPIV3/S-6P) and evaluated its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in rhesus macaques. A single intranasal/intratracheal dose of B/HPIV3/S-6P induced strong S-specific airway mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG responses. High levels of S-specific antibodies were also induced in serum, which efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern of alpha, beta, and delta lineages, while their ability to neutralize Omicron sub-lineages was lower. Furthermore, B/HPIV3/S-6P induced robust systemic and pulmonary S-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, including tissue-resident memory cells in the lungs. Following challenge, SARS-CoV-2 replication was undetectable in airways and lung tissues of immunized macaques. B/HPIV3/S-6P will be evaluated clinically as pediatric intranasal SARS-CoV-2/parainfluenza virus type 3 vaccine.

Abstract: Summary
Fully understanding autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genetics requires whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We present the latest release of the Autism Speaks MSSNG resource, which includes WGS data from 5,100 individuals with ASD and 6,212 non-ASD parents and siblings (total n = 11,312). Examining a wide variety of genetic variants in MSSNG and the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC; n = 9,205), we identified ASD-associated rare variants in 718/5,100 individuals with ASD from MSSNG (14.1%) and 350/2,419 from SSC (14.5%). Considering genomic architecture, 52% were nuclear sequence-level variants, 46% were nuclear structural variants (including copy-number variants, inversions, large insertions, uniparental isodisomies, and tandem repeat expansions), and 2% were mitochondrial variants. Our study provides a guidebook for exploring genotype-phenotype correlations in families who carry ASD-associated rare variants and serves as an entry point to the expanded studies required to dissect the etiology in the ∼85% of the ASD population that remain idiopathic.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems have been co-opted by Tn7-like transposable elements to direct RNA-guided transposition. Type V-K CRISPR-associated transposons rely on the concerted activities of the pseudonuclease Cas12k, the AAA+ ATPase TnsC, the Zn-finger protein TniQ, and the transposase TnsB. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopic structure of a target DNA-bound Cas12k-transposon recruitment complex comprised of RNA-guided Cas12k, TniQ, a polymeric TnsC filament and, unexpectedly, the ribosomal protein S15. Complex assembly, mediated by a network of interactions involving the guide RNA, TniQ, and S15, results in R-loop completion. TniQ contacts two TnsC protomers at the Cas12k-proximal filament end, likely nucleating its polymerization. Transposition activity assays corroborate our structural findings, implying that S15 is a bona fide component of the type V crRNA-guided transposon machinery. Altogether, our work uncovers key mechanistic aspects underpinning RNA-mediated assembly of CRISPR-associated transposons to guide their development as programmable tools for site-specific insertion of large DNA payloads.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput RNA sequencing offers broad opportunities to explore the Earth RNA virome. Mining 5,150 diverse metatranscriptomes uncovered >2.5 million RNA virus contigs. Analysis of >330,000 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) shows that this expansion corresponds to a 5-fold increase of the known RNA virus diversity. Gene content analysis revealed multiple protein domains previously not found in RNA viruses and implicated in virus-host interactions. Extended RdRP phylogeny supports the monophyly of the five established phyla and reveals two putative additional bacteriophage phyla and numerous putative additional classes and orders. The dramatically expanded phylum Lenarviricota, consisting of bacterial and related eukaryotic viruses, now accounts for a third of the RNA virome. Identification of CRISPR spacer matches and bacteriolytic proteins suggests that subsets of picobirnaviruses and partitiviruses, previously associated with eukaryotes, infect prokaryotic hosts.

Abstract: Summary
In aging, skeletal muscle strength and regenerative capacity decline, due in part to functional impairment of muscle stem cells (MuSCs), yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we capitalize on mass cytometry to identify high CD47 expression as a hallmark of dysfunctional MuSCs (CD47hi) with impaired regenerative capacity that predominate with aging. The prevalent CD47hi MuSC subset suppresses the residual functional CD47lo MuSC subset through a paracrine signaling loop, leading to impaired proliferation. We uncover that elevated CD47 levels on aged MuSCs result from increased U1 snRNA expression, which disrupts alternative polyadenylation. The deficit in aged MuSC function in regeneration can be overcome either by morpholino-mediated blockade of CD47 alternative polyadenylation or antibody blockade of thrombospondin-1/CD47 signaling, leading to improved regeneration in aged mice, with therapeutic implications. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized age-dependent alteration in CD47 levels and function in MuSCs, which underlies reduced muscle repair in aging.

Abstract: Summary
The TOC and TIC complexes are essential translocons that facilitate the import of the nuclear genome-encoded preproteins across the two envelope membranes of chloroplast, but their exact molecular identities and assembly remain unclear. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of TOC-TIC supercomplex from Chlamydomonas, containing a total of 14 identified components. The preprotein-conducting pore of TOC is a hybrid β-barrel co-assembled by Toc120 and Toc75, while the potential translocation path of TIC is formed by transmembrane helices from Tic20 and YlmG, rather than a classic model of Tic110. A rigid intermembrane space (IMS) scaffold bridges two chloroplast membranes, and a large hydrophilic cleft on the IMS scaffold connects TOC and TIC, forming a pathway for preprotein translocation. Our study provides structural insights into the TOC-TIC supercomplex composition, assembly, and preprotein translocation mechanism, and lays a foundation to interpret the evolutionary conservation and diversity of this fundamental translocon machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Low-molecular-weight (LMW) thiols are small-molecule antioxidants required for the maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis. However, many host-associated microbes, including the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, unexpectedly lack LMW-thiol biosynthetic pathways. Using reactivity-guided metabolomics, we identified the unusual LMW thiol ergothioneine (EGT) in H. pylori. Dietary EGT accumulates to millimolar levels in human tissues and has been broadly implicated in mitigating disease risk. Although certain microorganisms synthesize EGT, we discovered that H. pylori acquires this LMW thiol from the host environment using a highly selective ATP-binding cassette transporter—EgtUV. EgtUV confers a competitive colonization advantage in vivo and is widely conserved in gastrointestinal microbes. Furthermore, we found that human fecal bacteria metabolize EGT, which may contribute to production of the disease-associated metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide. Collectively, our findings illustrate a previously unappreciated mechanism of microbial redox regulation in the gut and suggest that inter-kingdom competition for dietary EGT may broadly impact human health.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence demonstrates important roles for metabolism in cell fate determination. However, it is a challenge to assess metabolism at a spatial resolution that acknowledges both heterogeneity and cellular dynamics in its tissue microenvironment. Using a multi-omics platform to study cell-type-specific dynamics in metabolism in complex tissues, we describe the metabolic trajectories during nephrogenesis in the developing human kidney. Exploiting in situ analysis of isotopic labeling, a shift from glycolysis toward fatty acid β-oxidation was observed during the differentiation from the renal vesicle toward the S-shaped body and the proximal tubules. In addition, we show that hiPSC-derived kidney organoids are characterized by a metabolic immature phenotype that fails to use mitochondrial long-chain fatty acids for energy metabolism. Furthermore, supplementation of butyrate enhances tubular epithelial differentiation and maturation in cultured kidney organoids. Our findings highlight the relevance of understanding metabolic trajectories to efficiently guide stem cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The function of biomolecular condensates is often restricted by condensate dissolution. Whether condensates can be suppressed without condensate dissolution is unclear. Here, we show that upstream regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway form functionally antagonizing condensates, and their coalescence into a common phase provides a mode of counteracting the function of biomolecular condensates without condensate dissolution. Specifically, the negative regulator SLMAP forms Hippo-inactivating condensates to facilitate pathway inhibition by the STRIPAK complex. In response to cell-cell contact or osmotic stress, the positive regulators AMOT and KIBRA form Hippo-activating condensates to facilitate pathway activation. The functionally antagonizing SLMAP and AMOT/KIBRA condensates further coalesce into a common phase to inhibit STRIPAK function. These findings provide a paradigm for restricting the activity of biomolecular condensates without condensate dissolution, shed light on the molecular principles of multiphase organization, and offer a conceptual framework for understanding upstream regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Neural migration is a critical step during brain development that requires the interactions of cell-surface guidance receptors. Cancer cells often hijack these mechanisms to disseminate. Here, we reveal crystal structures of Uncoordinated-5 receptor D (Unc5D) in complex with morphogen receptor glypican-3 (GPC3), forming an octameric glycoprotein complex. In the complex, four Unc5D molecules pack into an antiparallel bundle, flanked by four GPC3 molecules. Central glycan-glycan interactions are formed by N-linked glycans emanating from GPC3 (N241 in human) and C-mannosylated tryptophans of the Unc5D thrombospondin-like domains. MD simulations, mass spectrometry and structure-based mutants validate the crystallographic data. Anti-GPC3 nanobodies enhance or weaken Unc5-GPC3 binding and, together with mutant proteins, show that Unc5/GPC3 guide migrating pyramidal neurons in the mouse cortex, and cancer cells in an embryonic xenograft neuroblastoma model. The results demonstrate a conserved structural mechanism of cell guidance, where finely balanced Unc5-GPC3 interactions regulate cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Living organisms are constantly exposed to DNA damage, and optimal repair is therefore crucial. A characteristic hallmark of the response is the formation of sub-compartments around the site of damage, known as foci. Following multiple DNA breaks, the transcription factor p53 exhibits oscillations in its nuclear concentration, but how this dynamics can affect the repair remains unknown. Here, we formulate a theory for foci formation through droplet condensation and discover how oscillations in p53, with its specific periodicity and amplitude, optimize the repair process by preventing Ostwald ripening and distributing protein material in space and time. Based on the theory predictions, we reveal experimentally that the oscillatory dynamics of p53 does enhance the repair efficiency. These results connect the dynamical signaling of p53 with the microscopic repair process and create a new paradigm for the interplay of complex dynamics and phase transitions in biology.

Abstract: Summary
Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare disorder caused by hemizygous microdeletion of ∼27 contiguous genes. Despite neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits, individuals with WBS have spared or enhanced musical and auditory abilities, potentially offering an insight into the genetic basis of auditory perception. Here, we report that the mouse models of WBS have innately enhanced frequency-discrimination acuity and improved frequency coding in the auditory cortex (ACx). Chemogenetic rescue showed frequency-discrimination hyperacuity is caused by hyperexcitable interneurons in the ACx. Haploinsufficiency of one WBS gene, Gtf2ird1, replicated WBS phenotypes by downregulating the neuropeptide receptor VIPR1. VIPR1 is reduced in the ACx of individuals with WBS and in the cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells with the WBS microdeletion. Vipr1 deletion or overexpression in ACx interneurons mimicked or reversed, respectively, the cellular and behavioral phenotypes of WBS mice. Thus, the Gtf2ird1-Vipr1 mechanism in ACx interneurons may underlie the superior auditory acuity in WBS.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal microbiota is an important modulator of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which often complicates allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems increase the risk for intestinal GVHD, but mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that treatment with meropenem, a commonly used carbapenem, aggravates colonic GVHD in mice via the expansion of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT). BT has a broad ability to degrade dietary polysaccharides and host mucin glycans. BT in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice demonstrated upregulated expression of enzymes involved in the degradation of mucin glycans. These mice also had thinning of the colonic mucus layer and decreased levels of xylose in colonic luminal contents. Interestingly, oral xylose supplementation significantly prevented thinning of the colonic mucus layer in meropenem-treated mice. Specific nutritional supplementation strategies, including xylose supplementation, may combat antibiotic-mediated microbiome injury to reduce the risk for intestinal GVHD in allo-HSCT patients.

Abstract: Summary
The enthesis, a fibrocartilaginous transition between tendon and bone, is necessary for force transfer from muscle to bone to produce joint motion. The enthesis is prone to injury due to mechanical demands, and it cannot regenerate. A better understanding of how the enthesis develops will lead to more effective therapies to prevent pathology and promote regeneration. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to define the developmental transcriptome of the mouse entheses over postnatal stages. Six resident cell types, including enthesis progenitors and mineralizing chondrocytes, were identified along with their transcription factor regulons and temporal regulation. Following the prior discovery of the necessity of Gli1-lineage cells for mouse enthesis development and healing, we then examined their transcriptomes at single-cell resolution and demonstrated clonogenicity and multipotency of the Gli1-expressing progenitors. Transplantation of Gli1-lineage cells to mouse enthesis injuries improved healing, demonstrating their therapeutic potential for enthesis regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Although adult pluripotent stem cells (aPSCs) are found in many animal lineages, mechanisms for their formation during embryogenesis are unknown. Here, we leveraged Hofstenia miamia, a regenerative worm that possesses collectively pluripotent aPSCs called neoblasts and produces manipulable embryos. Lineage tracing and functional experiments revealed that one pair of blastomeres gives rise to cells that resemble neoblasts in distribution, behavior, and gene expression. In Hofstenia, aPSCs include transcriptionally distinct subpopulations that express markers associated with differentiated tissues; our data suggest that despite their heterogeneity, aPSCs are derived from one lineage, not from multiple tissue-specific lineages during development. Next, we combined single-cell transcriptome profiling across development with neoblast cell-lineage tracing and identified a molecular trajectory for neoblast formation that includes transcription factors Hes, FoxO, and Tbx. This identification of a cellular mechanism and molecular trajectory for aPSC formation opens the door for in vivo studies of aPSC regulation and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Quiescence regulation is essential for adult stem cell maintenance and sustained regeneration. Our studies uncovered that physiological changes in mitochondrial shape regulate the quiescent state of adult muscle stem cells (MuSCs). We show that MuSC mitochondria rapidly fragment upon an activation stimulus, via systemic HGF/mTOR, to drive the exit from deep quiescence. Deletion of the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1 and mitochondrial fragmentation transitions MuSCs into G-alert quiescence, causing premature activation and depletion upon a stimulus. OPA1 loss activates a glutathione (GSH)-redox signaling pathway promoting cell-cycle progression, myogenic gene expression, and commitment. MuSCs with chronic OPA1 loss, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, continue to reside in G-alert but acquire severe cell-cycle defects. Additionally, we provide evidence that OPA1 decline and impaired mitochondrial dynamics contribute to age-related MuSC dysfunction. These findings reveal a fundamental role for OPA1 and mitochondrial dynamics in establishing the quiescent state and activation potential of adult stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
The recent development of spatial omics methods has enabled single-cell profiling of the transcriptome and 3D genome organization with high spatial resolution. Expanding the repertoire of spatial omics tools, a spatially resolved single-cell epigenomics method will accelerate understanding of the spatial regulation of cell and tissue functions. Here, we report a method for spatially resolved epigenomic profiling of single cells using in situ tagmentation and transcription followed by multiplexed imaging. We demonstrated the ability to profile histone modifications marking active promoters, putative enhancers, and silent promoters in individual cells, and generated high-resolution spatial atlas of hundreds of active promoters and putative enhancers in embryonic and adult mouse brains. Our results suggested putative promoter-enhancer pairs and enhancer hubs regulating developmentally important genes. We envision this approach will be generally applicable to spatial profiling of epigenetic modifications and DNA-binding proteins, advancing our understanding of how gene expression is spatiotemporally regulated by the epigenome.

Abstract: Summary
Fungal microorganisms (mycobiota) comprise a small but immunoreactive component of the human microbiome, yet little is known about their role in human cancers. Pan-cancer analysis of multiple body sites revealed tumor-associated mycobiomes at up to 1 fungal cell per 104 tumor cells. In lung cancer, Blastomyces was associated with tumor tissues. In stomach cancers, high rates of Candida were linked to the expression of pro-inflammatory immune pathways, while in colon cancers Candida was predictive of metastatic disease and attenuated cellular adhesions. Across multiple GI sites, several Candida species were enriched in tumor samples and tumor-associated Candida DNA was predictive of decreased survival. The presence of Candida in human GI tumors was confirmed by external ITS sequencing of tumor samples and by culture-dependent analysis in an independent cohort. These data implicate the mycobiota in the pathogenesis of GI cancers and suggest that tumor-associated fungal DNA may serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the basis for cellular growth, proliferation, and function requires determining the roles of essential genes in diverse cellular processes, including visualizing their contributions to cellular organization and morphology. Here, we combined pooled CRISPR-Cas9-based functional screening of 5,072 fitness-conferring genes in human HeLa cells with microscopy-based imaging of DNA, the DNA damage response, actin, and microtubules. Analysis of >31 million individual cells identified measurable phenotypes for >90% of gene knockouts, implicating gene targets in specific cellular processes. Clustering of phenotypic similarities based on hundreds of quantitative parameters further revealed co-functional genes across diverse cellular activities, providing predictions for gene functions and associations. By conducting pooled live-cell screening of ∼450,000 cell division events for 239 genes, we additionally identified diverse genes with functional contributions to chromosome segregation. Our work establishes a resource detailing the consequences of disrupting core cellular processes that represents the functional landscape of essential human genes.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory landscapes drive complex developmental gene expression, but it remains unclear how their integrity is maintained when incorporating novel genes and functions during evolution. Here, we investigated how a placental mammal-specific gene, Zfp42, emerged in an ancient vertebrate topologically associated domain (TAD) without adopting or disrupting the conserved expression of its gene, Fat1. In ESCs, physical TAD partitioning separates Zfp42 and Fat1 with distinct local enhancers that drive their independent expression. This separation is driven by chromatin activity and not CTCF/cohesin. In contrast, in embryonic limbs, inactive Zfp42 shares Fat1’s intact TAD without responding to active Fat1 enhancers. However, neither Fat1 enhancer-incompatibility nor nuclear envelope-attachment account for Zfp42’s unresponsiveness. Rather, Zfp42’s promoter is rendered inert to enhancers by context-dependent DNA methylation. Thus, diverse mechanisms enabled the integration of independent Zfp42 regulation in the Fat1 locus. Critically, such regulatory complexity appears common in evolution as, genome wide, most TADs contain multiple independently expressed genes.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its clinical and fundamental importance, our understanding of early human development remains limited. Stem cell-derived, embryo-like structures (or embryoids) allowing studies of early development without using natural embryos can potentially help fill the knowledge gap of human development. Herein, transcriptome at the single-cell level of a human embryoid model was profiled at different time points. Molecular maps of lineage diversifications from the pluripotent human epiblast toward the amniotic ectoderm, primitive streak/mesoderm, and primordial germ cells were constructed and compared with in vivo primate data. The comparative transcriptome analyses reveal a critical role of NODAL signaling in human mesoderm and primordial germ cell specification, which is further functionally validated. Through comparative transcriptome analyses and validations with human blastocysts and in vitro cultured cynomolgus embryos, we further proposed stringent criteria for distinguishing between human blastocyst trophectoderm and early amniotic ectoderm cells.
