Abstract: Summary
A longstanding question in mammalian development is whether the divisions that segregate pluripotent progenitor cells for the future embryo from cells that differentiate into extraembryonic structures are asymmetric in cell-fate instructions. The transcription factor Cdx2 plays a key role in the first cell-fate decision. Here, using live-embryo imaging, we show that localization of Cdx2 transcripts becomes asymmetric during development, preceding cell lineage segregation. Cdx2 transcripts preferentially localize apically at the late eight-cell stage and become inherited asymmetrically during divisions that set apart pluripotent and differentiating cells. Asymmetric localization depends on a cis element within the coding region of Cdx2 and requires cell polarization as well as intact microtubule and actin cytoskeletons. Failure to enrich Cdx2 transcripts apically results in a significant decrease in the number of pluripotent cells. We discuss how the asymmetric localization and segregation of Cdx2 transcripts could contribute to multiple mechanisms that establish different cell fates in the mouse embryo.

Abstract: Summary
Sestrins (Sesns) protect cells from oxidative stress. The mechanism underlying the antioxidant effect of Sesns has remained unknown, however. The Nrf2-Keap1 pathway provides cellular defense against oxidative stress by controlling the expression of antioxidant enzymes. We now show that Sesn1 and Sesn2 interact with the Nrf2 suppressor Keap1, the autophagy substrate p62, and the ubiquitin ligase Rbx1 and that the antioxidant function of Sesns is mediated through activation of Nrf2 in a manner reliant on p62-dependent autophagic degradation of Keap1. Sesn2 was upregulated in the liver of mice subjected to fasting or subsequent refeeding with a high-carbohydrate, fat-free diet, whereas only refeeding promoted Keap1 degradation and Nrf2 activation, because only refeeding induced p62 expression. Ablation of Sesn2 blocked Keap1 degradation and Nrf2 activation induced by refeeding and thereby increased the susceptibility of the liver to oxidative damage resulting from the acute stimulation of lipogenesis associated with refeeding.

Abstract: The pluripotent nature of embryonic stem (ES) cells makes them powerful tools in cell replacement therapy for severe degenerative diseases, such as heart failure. However, the development of strategies to increase the efficiency of cardiomyocyte (CMC) differentiation is still needed to produce a sufficient amount of cells for clinical applications. This paper evaluates the impact of the size and the aggregation of embryoid bodies (EBs) on the efficiency of ES cell differentiation into CMCs. ES cells were generated from RAP inbred mice. These cells expressed pluripotency markers and induced teratomas when injected into syngeneic mice, which made them suitable for differentiation into CMCs. We found that the EBs that were formed as a result of in vitro ES cell aggregation generated contractile tissue in direct correlation with the initial number of ES cells. Furthermore, the presence of knock-out serum replacement (KO-SR) during ES cell aggregation resulted in less compacted EBs and increased cell differentiation into CMCs compared to the presence of foetal bovine serum. In conclusion, cardiac differentiation of ES cells is dependent on the size and the degree of compaction of EBs, and the presence of KO-SR during initiation of EBs may lead to improved cardiogenic differentiation of ES cells.

Abstract: The presence of beta-proteins containing a core-box region in specific regions of reptilian epidermis has been studied by immunological methods. Alpha-keratins are detected by the antibody AK2 that recognizes a sequence toward the C-terminal of acidic alpha-keratins of 48–52kDa. Beta-proteins are recognized by an antibody directed to the core-box region specific for these proteins of 18–37kDa. The AK2 antibody labels with variable intensity alpha-keratin bundles in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes in the epidermis of representative species of reptiles but immunolabeling decreases or disappears in pre-corneous and corneous cells. As opposite, the core-box antibody only labels with variable intensity the dense beta-corneous material formed in pre-corneous and corneous layers of crocodilian and turtle epidermis. In lepidosaurian epidermis the core-box antibody labels the beta-layer while the mesos and alpha-layers are poorly or not labeled. The immunological evidence indicates that beta-proteins are synthesized in the upper spinosus and pre-corneous layers of the epidermis and replace or mask the initial alpha-keratin framework present in keratinocytes as they differentiate into cells of the beta-layer. In the specialized pad lamellae of gecko and anoline lizards charged beta-proteins accumulate in the adhesive setae and may affect the mechanism of adhesion that allows these lizards to walk vertical surfaces. The addition of beta-proteins to the alpha-keratins in upper cell layers of the epidermis recalls the process of cornification of mammalian epidermis where specific keratin-associated proteins (involucrin, loricrin and filaggrin) associate with the keratin framework in terminally differentiating keratinocytes of the stratum corneum.

Abstract: Summary
During plant photosynthesis, photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII), located in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast, use light energy to mobilize electron transport. Different modes of electron flow exist. Linear electron flow is driven by both photosystems and generates ATP and NADPH, whereas cyclic electron flow (CEF) is driven by PSI alone and generates ATP only. Two variants of CEF exist in flowering plants, of which one is sensitive to antimycin A (AA) and involves the two thylakoid proteins, PGR5 and PGRL1. However, neither the mechanism nor the site of reinjection of electrons from ferredoxin into the thylakoid electron transport chain during AA-sensitive CEF is known. Here, we show that PGRL1 accepts electrons from ferredoxin in a PGR5-dependent manner and reduces quinones in an AA-sensitive fashion. PGRL1 activity itself requires several redox-active cysteine residues and a Fe-containing cofactor. We therefore propose that PGRL1 is the elusive ferredoxin-plastoquinone reductase (FQR).

Abstract: Zebrafish transgenic lines are important experimental tools for lineage tracing and imaging studies. It is crucial to precisely characterize the cell lineages labeled in transgenic lines to understand their limitations and thus properly interpret the data obtained from their use; only then can we confidently select a line appropriate for our particular research objectives. Here we profiled the cell lineages labeled in the closely related neural crest transgenic lines Tg(foxd3:GFP), Tg(sox10:eGFP) and Tg(sox10:mRFP). These fish were crossed to generate embryos, in which foxd3 and sox10 transgenic neural crest labeling could be directly compared at the cellular level using live confocal imaging. We have identified key differences in the cell lineages labeled in each line during early neural crest development and demonstrated that the most anterior cranial neural crest cells initially migrating out of neural tube at the level of forebrain and anterior midbrain express sox10: eGFP and sox10:mRFP, but not foxd3:GFP. This differential profile was robustly maintained in the differentiating progeny of the neural crest lineages until 3.5dpf. Our data will enable researchers to make an informed choice in selecting transgenic lines for future neural crest research.

Abstract: Calcium signaling in cells directs diverse physiological processes. The calcium waves triggered by fertilization is a highly conserved calcium signaling event essential for egg activation, and has been documented in every egg tested. This activity is one of the few highly conserved events of egg activation through the course of evolution. Echinoderm eggs, as well as many other cell types, have three main intracellular Ca2+ mobilizing messengers – IP3, cADPR and NAADP. Both cADPR and NAADP were identified as Ca2+ mobilizing messengers using the sea urchin egg homogenate, and this experimental system, along with the intact urchin and starfish oocyte/egg, continues to be a vital tool for investigating the mechanism of action of calcium signals. While many of the major regulatory steps of the IP3 pathway are well resolved, both cADPR and NAADP remain understudied in terms of our understanding of the fundamental process of egg activation at fertilization. Recently, NAADP has been shown to trigger Ca2+ release from acidic vesicles, separately from the ER, and a new class of calcium channels, the two-pore channels (TPCs), was identified as the likely targets for this messenger. Moreover, it was found that both cADPR and NAADP can be synthesized by the same family of enzymes, the ADP-rybosyl cyclases (ARCs). In this context of increasing amount of information, the potential coupling and functional roles of different messengers, intracellular stores and channels in the formation of the fertilization calcium wave in echinoderms will be critically evaluated.

Abstract: Summary
To protect the genome, cells have evolved a diverse set of pathways designed to sense, signal, and repair multiple types of DNA damage. To assess the degree of coordination and crosstalk among these pathways, we systematically mapped changes in the cell’s genetic network across a panel of different DNA-damaging agents, resulting in ∼1,800,000 differential measurements. Each agent was associated with a distinct interaction pattern, which, unlike single-mutant phenotypes or gene expression data, has high statistical power to pinpoint the specific repair mechanisms at work. The agent-specific networks revealed roles for the histone acetyltranferase Rtt109 in the mutagenic bypass of DNA lesions and the neddylation machinery in cell-cycle regulation and genome stability, while the network induced by multiple agents implicates Irc21, an uncharacterized protein, in checkpoint control and DNA repair. Our multiconditional genetic interaction map provides a unique resource that identifies agent-specific and general DNA damage response pathways.

Abstract: Summary
AMPK is a metabolic sensor that helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis. Despite evidence linking AMPK with tumor suppressor functions, the role of AMPK in tumorigenesis and tumor metabolism is unknown. Here we show that AMPK negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) in cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Genetic ablation of the α1 catalytic subunit of AMPK accelerates Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. Inactivation of AMPKα in both transformed and nontransformed cells promotes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis, increased allocation of glucose carbon into lipids, and biomass accumulation. These metabolic effects require normoxic stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), as silencing HIF-1α reverses the shift to aerobic glycolysis and the biosynthetic and proliferative advantages conferred by reduced AMPKα signaling. Together our findings suggest that AMPK activity opposes tumor development and that its loss fosters tumor progression in part by regulating cellular metabolic pathways that support cell growth and proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence is characterized by a stable cell growth arrest, thus providing a tumor suppression mechanism. However, the underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we show that a decrease in deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels underlies oncogene-induced stable senescence-associated cell growth arrest. The decrease in dNTP levels is caused by oncogene-induced repression of ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2), a rate-limiting protein in dNTP synthesis. This precedes the senescence-associated cell-cycle exit and coincides with the DNA damage response. Consistently, RRM2 downregulation is both necessary and sufficient for senescence. Strikingly, suppression of nucleotide metabolism by RRM2 repression is also necessary for maintenance of the stable senescence-associated cell growth arrest. Furthermore, RRM2 repression correlates with senescence status in benign nevi and melanoma, and its knockdown drives senescence of melanoma cells. These data reveal the molecular basis whereby the stable growth arrest of oncogene-induced senescence is established and maintained through suppression of nucleotide metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
BubR1 insufficiency occurs with natural aging and induces progeroid phenotypes in both mice and children with mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome. In response to BubR1 insufficiency, skeletal muscle, fat, and lens tissue engage p19Arf to attenuate senescence and age-related deterioration. Here, we address how p19Arf exerts this caretaker role using BubR1 progeroid mice lacking p53 or its transcriptional target p21. We show that p53 delays functional decline of skeletal muscle and fat in a p21-dependent fashion by inhibiting p16Ink4a-mediated senescence of progenitor cells. Strikingly, p53 also attenuates the formation of cataractous lenses, but here its antiaging effect is p21 independent, as we found p21 to promote senescence of lens epithelial cells and cataract formation. Together, these results demonstrate that p53 counteracts tissue destruction in response to BubR1 insufficiency through diverse mechanisms and uncover a causal link between senescence of the progenitor cell compartment and age-related dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The production of pigment by melanocytes tans the skin and protects against skin cancers. UV-exposed keratinocytes secrete α-MSH, which then activates melanin formation in melanocytes by inducing the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). We show that PPAR-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α and PGC-1β are critical components of this melanogenic system in melanocytes. α-MSH signaling strongly induces PGC-1α expression and stabilizes both PGC-1α and PGC-1β proteins. The PGC-1s in turn activate the MITF promoter, and their expression correlates strongly with that of MITF in human melanoma cell lines and biopsy specimens. Inhibition of PGC-1α and PGC-1β blocks the α-MSH-mediated induction of MITF and melanogenic genes. Conversely, overexpression of PGC-1α induces pigment formation in cell culture and transgenic animals. Finally, polymorphism studies reveal expression quantitative trait loci in the PGC-1β gene that correlate with tanning ability and protection from melanoma in humans. These data identify PGC-1 coactivators as regulators of human tanning.

Abstract: Summary
Forkhead box O (FOXO; DAF-16 in worms) transcription factors, which are of vital importance in cell-cycle control, stress resistance, tumor suppression, and organismal lifespan, are largely regulated through nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. Insulin signaling keeps FOXO/DAF-16 cytoplasmic, and hence transcriptionally inactive. Conversely, as in loss of insulin signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate FOXO/DAF-16 through nuclear accumulation. How ROS regulate the nuclear translocation of FOXO/DAF-16 is largely unknown. Cysteine oxidation can stabilize protein-protein interactions through the formation of disulfide-bridges when cells encounter ROS. Using a proteome-wide screen that identifies ROS-induced mixed disulfide-dependent complexes, we discovered several interaction partners of FOXO4, one of which is the nuclear import receptor transportin-1. We show that disulfide formation with transportin-1 is required for nuclear localization and the activation of FOXO4/DAF-16 induced by ROS, but not by the loss of insulin signaling. This molecular mechanism for nuclear shuttling is conserved in C. elegans and directly connects redox signaling to the longevity protein FOXO/DAF-16.

Abstract: Ultrastructural characteristics of late spermatids and spermatozoa during spermiogenesis in longtooth grouper Epinephelus bruneus from Jeju, Korea were investigated using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The spermiogenesis type of E. bruneus belongs to type I because of nuclear rotation occurrence. The spherical head of late spermatids and spermatozoa ultrastructurally consist of apple-shaped nucleus, nuclear notch (Y or branch-shaped) and nuclear fossa. The midpiece contains the proximal centriole (9+0 microtubule structure), two centrioles connection structure (three osmophilic filaments), the distal centriole (9+0 microtubule structure), an osmophilic basal foot, two necklaces (six or seven osmophilic particles) and osmophilic alar sheets. It contains six to nine spherical mitochondria showing two rows arrangement type. Also a flagellum (9+2 microtubule structure) presents six swelling shaped segments type lateral fins with regular interval. Consequently, ultrastructural features of E. bruneus spermatids and spermatozoa contribute to provide useful systematic characters for taxonomic purpose. It may contribute to study that whether ultrastructural features of cellular organelles (cytoplasmic canal, necklace and lateral fins) correlate to physiological function or not on the duration of motility and survival in fish spermatozoa.

Abstract: Interest in the morphological and physiological events that take place during fertilization in fish eggs began as early as the late 1800s. In these initial studies, and up to the present day, fertilization has been investigated in a range of different fish species. In this short review, we focus on just one aspect of fertilization in fish; the role of Ca2+ signaling. Somewhat surprisingly, to date, the Ca2+ dynamics at activation/fertilization have been visualized in only two teleost species, the medaka (Oryzias latipes) and the zebrafish (Danio rerio), where their year-round breeding potential and small size, as well as the optical clarity of the eggs and ex utero fertilization, have made them the model of choice of researchers studying fertilization and early development. In these two species, activation/fertilization is accompanied by a single self-propagating Ca2+ wave, unlike the multiple regenerating waves reported for mammals, ascidians, certain amphibians (urodeles) and annelids. During medaka and zebrafish fertilization, the Ca2+ wave is initiated at the micropyle, the point of sperm/egg contact located at the animal pole, and then it propagates at ∼10–12μm/s to its antipode at the vegetal pole.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolism of glucose and glutamine, primary carbon sources utilized by mitochondria to generate energy and macromolecules for cell growth, is directly regulated by mTORC1. We show that glucose and glutamine, by supplying carbons to the TCA cycle to produce ATP, positively feed back to mTORC1 through an AMPK-, TSC1/2-, and Rag-independent mechanism by regulating mTORC1 assembly and its lysosomal localization. We discovered that the ATP-dependent TTT-RUVBL1/2 complex was disassembled and repressed by energy depletion, resulting in its decreased interaction with mTOR. The TTT-RUVBL complex was necessary for the interaction between mTORC1 and Rag and formation of mTORC1 obligate dimers. In cancer tissues, TTT-RUVBL complex mRNAs were elevated and positively correlated with transcripts encoding proteins of anabolic metabolism and mitochondrial function—all mTORC1-regulated processes. Thus, the TTT-RUVBL1/2 complex responds to the cell’s metabolic state, directly regulating the functional assembly of mTORC1 and indirectly controlling the nutrient signal from Rags to mTORC1.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic regulation of histone methylation represents a fundamental epigenetic mechanism underlying eukaryotic gene regulation, yet little is known about how the catalytic activities of histone demethylases are regulated. Here, we identify and characterize NPAC/GLYR1 as an LSD2/KDM1b-specific cofactor that stimulates H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 demethylation. We determine the crystal structures of LSD2 alone and LSD2 in complex with the NPAC linker region in the absence or presence of histone H3 peptide, at resolutions of 2.9, 2.0, and 2.25 Å, respectively. These crystal structures and further biochemical characterization define a dodecapeptide of NPAC (residues 214–225) as the minimal functional unit for its cofactor activity and provide structural determinants and a molecular mechanism underlying the intrinsic cofactor activity of NPAC in stimulating LSD2-catalyzed H3K4 demethylation. Thus, these findings establish a model for how a cofactor directly regulates histone demethylation and will have a significant impact on our understanding of catalytic-activity-based epigenetic regulation.

Dll4 and PDGF-BB Convert Committed Skeletal Myoblasts to Pericytes without Erasing Their Myogenic Memory,

Abstract: Summary
Pericytes are endothelial-associated cells that contribute to vessel wall. Here, we report that pericytes may derive from direct conversion of committed skeletal myoblasts. When exposed to Dll4 and PDGF-BB, but not Dll1, skeletal myoblasts downregulate myogenic genes, except Myf5, and upregulate pericyte markers, whereas inhibition of Notch signaling restores myogenesis. Moreover, when cocultured with endothelial cells, skeletal myoblasts, previously treated with Dll4 and PDGF-BB, adopt a perithelial position stabilizing newly formed vessel-like networks in vitro and in vivo. In a transgenic mouse model in which cells expressing MyoD activate Notch, skeletal myogenesis is abolished and pericyte genes are activated. Even if overexpressed, Myf5 does not trigger myogenesis because Notch induces Id3, partially sequestering Myf5 and inhibiting MEF2 expression. Myf5-expressing cells adopt a perithelial position, as occasionally also observed in wild-type (WT) embryos. These data indicate that endothelium, via Dll4 and PDGF-BB, induces a fate switch in adjacent skeletal myoblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential regulators of immune responses; however, transcriptional mechanisms that establish DC lineage commitment are poorly defined. Here, we report that the PU.1 transcription factor induces specific remodeling of the higher-order chromatin structure at the interferon regulatory factor 8 (Irf8) gene to initiate DC fate choice. An Irf8 reporter mouse enabled us to pinpoint an initial progenitor stage at which DCs separate from other myeloid lineages in the bone marrow. In the absence of Irf8, this progenitor undergoes DC-to-neutrophil reprogramming, indicating that DC commitment requires an active, Irf8-dependent escape from alternative myeloid lineage potential. Mechanistically, myeloid Irf8 expression depends on high PU.1 levels, resulting in local chromosomal looping and activation of a lineage- and developmental-stage-specific cis-enhancer. These data delineate PU.1 as a concentration-dependent rheostat of myeloid lineage selection by controlling long-distance contacts between regulatory elements and suggest that specific higher-order chromatin remodeling at the Irf8 gene determines DC differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, encoding members of the Gαq family of G protein α subunits, are the driver oncogenes in uveal melanoma, and mutations in Gq-linked G protein-coupled receptors have been identified recently in numerous human malignancies. How Gαq and its coupled receptors transduce mitogenic signals is still unclear because of the complexity of signaling events perturbed upon Gq activation. Using a synthetic-biology approach and a genome-wide RNAi screen, we found that a highly conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Trio, is essential for activating Rho- and Rac-regulated signaling pathways acting on JNK and p38, and thereby transducing proliferative signals from Gαq to the nucleus independently of phospholipase C-β. Indeed, whereas many biological responses elicited by Gq depend on the transient activation of second-messenger systems, Gq utilizes a hard-wired protein-protein-interaction-based signaling circuitry to achieve the sustained stimulation of proliferative pathways, thereby controlling normal and aberrant cell growth.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice is governed by the opposing activities of 53BP1 and BRCA1. 53BP1 stimulates nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), whereas BRCA1 promotes end resection and homologous recombination (HR). Here we show that 53BP1 is an inhibitor of BRCA1 accumulation at DSB sites, specifically in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of 53BP1 physically recruits RIF1 to DSB sites, and we identify RIF1 as the critical effector of 53BP1 during DSB repair. Remarkably, RIF1 accumulation at DSB sites is strongly antagonized by BRCA1 and its interacting partner CtIP. Lastly, we show that depletion of RIF1 is able to restore end resection and RAD51 loading in BRCA1-depleted cells. This work therefore identifies a cell cycle-regulated circuit, underpinned by RIF1 and BRCA1, that governs DSB repair pathway choice to ensure that NHEJ dominates in G1 and HR is favored from S phase onward.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostasis in adult tissues is maintained by resident stem cells and their progeny. Little is known about the regulation of tissue homeostasis by organ-organ interaction. Here we demonstrate that trachea-derived Decapentaplegic (Dpp), the main bone morphogenetic protein ligand in Drosophila, is essential for adult midgut homeostasis. We show that Dpp signaling is primarily activated in enterocytes (ECs). Depletion of Dpp signaling in ECs results in excess amounts of intestinal stem-cell-like cells and their progeny. Importantly, we find that Dpp is expressed specifically in tracheal cells that reach the intestinal cells through the visceral muscles. Depletion of dpp expression in tracheal cells phenocopies the Dpp loss-of-function defects in ECs. Our data demonstrate that the Drosophila trachea not only exchanges air for bodily needs but also produces a Dpp morphogen essential for neighboring tissue homeostasis. This work will provide important insights into the mechanisms of tissue homeostasis control by interorgan communication.

Abstract: Summary
The mammary epithelium is a dynamic, highly hormone-responsive tissue. To explore chromatin modifications underlying its lineage specification and hormone responsiveness, we determined genome-wide histone methylation profiles of mammary epithelial subpopulations in different states. The marked differences in H3K27 trimethylation between subpopulations in the adult gland suggest that epithelial cell-fate decisions are orchestrated by polycomb-complex-mediated repression. Remarkably, the mammary epigenome underwent highly specific changes in different hormonal contexts, with a profound change being observed in the global H3K27me3 map of luminal cells during pregnancy. We therefore examined the role of the key H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 in mammary physiology. Its expression and phosphorylation coincided with H3K27me3 modifications and peaked during pregnancy, driven in part by progesterone. Targeted deletion of Ezh2 impaired alveologenesis during pregnancy, preventing lactation, and drastically reduced stem/progenitor cell numbers. Taken together, these findings reveal that Ezh2 couples hormonal stimuli to epigenetic changes that underpin progenitor activity, lineage specificity, and alveolar expansion in the mammary gland.

Abstract: The ultrastructure of the ovary and the female atrium during cocoon formation was investigated in the subterranean freshwater planarian Dendrocoelum constrictum. In the peripheral portion of the ovary, the oogonia are recognized as undifferentiated germ cells, which are morphologically similar to neoblasts that have a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. Oocyte maturation is characterized by a marked growth of the cytoplasm because of the accumulation of cytoplasmic organelles and inclusions. The Golgi complexes begin to increase within the ooplasm and produce vesicles with an electron-dense content that fuse to produce larger spherical globules with homogeneous and electron-dense material. In the mature oocyte, the spherical globules migrate toward the cortical ooplasm, forming a continuous monolayer. We confirm that these spherical globules, which represent cortical granules rather than eggshell globules, vary in size up to 2μm and their electron-dense content shows concentric thin bands. After leaving the ovary through the oviduct, the mature and fertilized oocytes reach the female atrium where they are packaged with thousands of vitelline cells in the cocoon shell. Based on our ultrastructural analysis, we demonstrate that the wall of the cocoon shell is composed of two layers, each of which has a different origin. The shell granules extruded from the vitelline cells are involved in the secretion of the inner layer of the cocoon shell, whereas the outer layer of the cocoon shell is synthesized by the epithelial cells in the genital atrium.

Abstract: Summary
DNA unwinding at eukaryotic replication forks displaces parental histones, which must be redeposited onto nascent DNA in order to preserve chromatin structure. By screening systematically for replisome components that pick up histones released from chromatin into a yeast cell extract, we found that the Mcm2 helicase subunit binds histones cooperatively with the FACT (facilitiates chromatin transcription) complex, which helps to re-establish chromatin during transcription. FACT does not associate with the Mcm2-7 helicase at replication origins during G1 phase but is subsequently incorporated into the replisome progression complex independently of histone binding and uniquely among histone chaperones. The amino terminal tail of Mcm2 binds histones via a conserved motif that is dispensable for DNA synthesis per se but helps preserve subtelomeric chromatin, retain the 2 micron minichromosome, and support growth in the absence of Ctf18-RFC. Our data indicate that the eukaryotic replication and transcription machineries use analogous assemblies of multiple chaperones to preserve chromatin integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) represent key constituents of major and minor spliceosomes. snRNPs contain a common core, composed of seven Sm proteins bound to snRNA, which forms in a step-wise and factor-mediated reaction. The assembly chaperone pICln initially mediates the formation of an otherwise unstable pentameric Sm protein unit. This so-called 6S complex docks subsequently onto the SMN complex, which removes pICln and enables the transfer of pre-assembled Sm proteins onto snRNA. X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy was used to investigate the structural basis of snRNP assembly. The 6S complex structure identifies pICln as an Sm protein mimic, which enables the topological organization of the Sm pentamer in a closed ring. A second structure of 6S bound to the SMN complex components SMN and Gemin2 uncovers a plausible mechanism of pICln elimination and Sm protein activation for snRNA binding. Our studies reveal how assembly factors facilitate formation of RNA-protein complexes in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modifications on core histones can serve as binding scaffolds for chromatin-associated proteins. Proteins that specifically bind to or “read” these modifications were previously identified in mass spectrometry-based proteomics screens based on stable isotope-labeling in cell lines. Here we describe a sensitive, label-free histone peptide pull-down technology with extracts of different mouse tissues. Applying this workflow to the classical activating and repressive epigenetic marks on histone H3, H3K4me3, and H3K9me3, we identified known and putative readers in extracts from brain, liver, kidney, and testis. A large class of proteins were specifically repelled by H3K4me3. Our screen reached near-saturation of direct interactors, most of which are ubiquitously expressed. In addition, it revealed a number of specialized readers in tissues such as testis. Apart from defining the chromatin interaction landscape in mouse tissues, our workflow can be used for peptides with different modifications and cell types of any organism.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report that kinase-dead IKKα knockin mice develop spontaneous lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) associated with IKKα downregulation and marked pulmonary inflammation. IKKα reduction upregulated the expression of p63, Trim29, and keratin 5 (K5), which serve as diagnostic markers for human lung SCCs. IKKαlowK5+p63hi cell expansion and SCC formation were accompanied by inflammation-associated deregulation of oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and stem cell regulators. Reintroducing transgenic K5.IKKα, depleting macrophages, and reconstituting irradiated mutant animals with wild-type bone marrow (BM) prevented SCC development, suggesting that BM-derived IKKα mutant macrophages promote the transition of IKKαlowK5+p63hi cells to tumor cells. This mouse model resembles human lung SCCs, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying lung malignancy development, and identifies targets for therapy of lung SCCs.

Abstract: Fuel ethanol production is far more costly to produce than fossil fuels. There are a number of approaches to cost effective fuel ethanol production from biomass. We characterized stress response of thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae KNU5377 during glucose-based batch fermentation at high temperature (40°C). S. cerevisiae KNU5377 (KNU5377) transcription factors (Hsf1, Msn2/4, and Yap1), metabolic enzymes (hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase), antioxidant enzymes (thioredoxin 3, thioredoxin reductase, and porin), and molecular chaperones and its cofactors (Hsp104, Hsp82, Hsp60, Hsp42, Hsp30, Hsp26, Cpr1, Sti1, and Zpr1) are upregulated during fermentation, in comparison to S. cerevisiae S288C (S288C). Expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase increased significantly in KNU5377 cells. In addition, cellular hydroperoxide and protein oxidation, particularly lipid peroxidation of triosephosphate isomerase, was lower in KNU5377 than in S288C. Thus, KNU5377 activates various cell rescue proteins through transcription activators, improving tolerance and increasing alcohol yield by rapidly responding to fermentation stress through redox homeostasis and proteostasis.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease of unknown origin, which exhibits a complex heterogeneity in its pathophysiological background, resulting in differential responses to a range of therapies and poor long-term prognosis. RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) are key player cells in RA pathogenesis. Identification of DNA methylation biomarkers is a field that provides potential for improving the process of diagnosis and prognosis of various human diseases. We utilized a genome-wide technique, methylated DNA isolation assay (MeDIA), in combination with a high resolution CpG microarray for discovery of novel hypermethylated genes in RASFs. Thirteen genes (APEX1, EBF3, EGR2, EN1, IRX1, IRX6, KIF12, LHX2, MIPOL1, SGTA, SIN3A, TOLLIP, and ZHX2) with three consecutive hypermethylated probes were isolated as candidate genes through two CpG microarrays. Pyrosequencing assay was performed to validate the methylation status of TGF-p signaling components, EBF3 and IRX1 genes in RASFs and osteoarthritis (OA) SFs. Hypermethylation at CpG sites in the EBF3 and IRX1 genes was observed with a high methylation index (MI) in RASFs (52.5% and 41.4%, respectively), while a lower MI was observ ed in OASFs and healthy SFs (13.2% for EBF3 and 4.3% for IRX1). In addition, RT-PCR analysis showed a remarkable decrease in their mRNA expression in the RA group, compared with the OA or healthy control, and their reduction levels correlated with MI. The current findings suggest that methylation-associated down-regulation of EBF3 and IRX1 genes may play an important role in a pathogenic effect of TGF-β on RASFs. However, further clinical validation with large numbers of patients is needed in order to confirm our findings.

Abstract: Summary
A classical role of the hormone auxin is in the formation of flowers at the periphery of the reproductive shoot apex. Mutants in regulators of polar auxin transport or in the auxin-responsive transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) form naked inflorescence “pins” lacking flowers. How auxin maxima and MP direct initiation of flower primordia is poorly understood. Here, we identify three genes whose expression is directly induced by auxin-activated MP that furthermore jointly regulate flower primordium initiation. These three genes encode known regulators of flower development: LEAFY (LFY), which specifies floral fate, and two AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE/PLETHORA transcription factors, key regulators of floral growth. Our study thus reveals a mechanistic link between flower primordium initiation and subsequent steps in flower morphogenesis. Finally, we uncover direct positive feedback from LFY to the auxin pathway. The auxin LFY module we describe may have been recruited during evolution to pattern other plant organ systems.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired lung function caused by decreased airway diameter (bronchoconstriction) is frequently observed whether body weight is abnormally high or low. That these opposite conditions affect the airways similarly suggests that the regulation of airway diameter and body weight are intertwined. We show here that, independently of its regulation of appetite, melanocortin pathway, or sympathetic tone, leptin is necessary and sufficient to increase airway diameter by signaling through its cognate receptor in cholinergic neurons. The latter decreases parasympathetic signaling through the M3 muscarinic receptor in airway smooth muscle cells, thereby increasing airway diameter without affecting local inflammation. Accordingly, decreasing parasympathetic tone genetically or pharmacologically corrects bronchoconstriction and normalizes lung function in obese mice regardless of bronchial inflammation. This study reveals an adipocyte-dependent regulation of bronchial diameter whose disruption contributes to the impaired lung function caused by abnormal body weight. These findings may be of use in the management of obesity-associated asthma.

Abstract: Summary
How homologous chromosomes (homologs) find their partner, pair, and recombine during meiosis constitutes the central phenomenon in eukaryotic genetics. It is widely believed that, in most organisms, SPO11-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced during prophase I precede and are required for efficient homolog pairing. We now show that, in the mouse, a significant level of homolog pairing precedes programmed DNA cleavage. Strikingly, this early chromosome pairing still requires SPO11 but is not dependent on its ability to make DSBs or homologous recombination proteins. Intriguingly, SUN1, a protein required for telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope and for post-DSB synapsis, is also required for early pre-DSB homolog pairing. Furthermore, pre-DSB pairing at telomeres persists upon entry into prophase I and is most likely important for initiation of synapsis. Our findings suggest that the DSB-triggered homology search may mainly serve to proofread and stabilize the pre-DSB pairing of homologous chromosomes.

Abstract: In many animals, a rise in intracellular calcium levels is the trigger for egg activation, the process by which an arrested mature oocyte transitions to prepare for embryogenesis. In nearly all animals studied to date, this calcium rise, and thus egg activation, is triggered by the fertilizing sperm. However in the insects that have been examined, fertilization is not necessary to activate their oocytes. Rather, these insects’ eggs activate as they transit through the female's reproductive tract, regardless of male contribution. Recent studies in Drosophila have shown that egg activation nevertheless requires calcium and that the downstream events and molecules of egg activation are also conserved, despite the difference in initial trigger. Genetic studies have uncovered essential roles for the calcium-dependent enzyme calcineurin and its regulator calcipressin, and have hinted at roles for calmodulin, in Drosophila egg activation. Physiological and in vitro studies have led to a model in which mechanical forces that impact the Drosophila oocyte as it moves through the reproductive tract triggers the influx of calcium from the external environment, thereby initiating egg activation. Future research will aim to test this model, as well as to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of cytoplasmic calcium flux and mode of signal propagation in this unique system.

Abstract: Human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hPMSCs) have been shown to possess immunosuppressive effects against T cells and support the expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from umbilical cord blood (UCB). However, the characteristics of hPMSCs compared with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) are not fully understood. Here, we show that hPMSCs have similar regulatory effects on T cell activation, proliferation and cytokine secretion as hBMSCs and demonstrate that PDL1 and B7H4, negative co-stimulatory molecules, are involved in the T cell immunosuppressive activities of hPMSCs and hBMSCs, respectively. hPMSCs efficiently enhanced the expansion of CD34+ cells from UCB compared with hBMSCs. Furthermore, hPMSCs maintained the expression of adhesion molecules (CD11a, CD44 and CD49e) in CD34+ cells. Similar effects were observed for both hPMSCs and hBMSCs on CD34+ cell chemotaxis and cytokine production, such as SDF-1α, IL-6 and SCF. Therefore, hPMSCs may be an ideal alternative source of hBMSCs for basic research and clinical applications, which may be significant in future efforts to explore the potential clinical utility of hPMSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The transmembrane protein deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and its ligand, netrin-1, regulate synaptogenesis during development, but their function in the mature central nervous system is unknown. Given that DCC promotes cell-cell adhesion, is expressed by neurons, and activates proteins that signal at synapses, we hypothesized that DCC expression by neurons regulates synaptic function and plasticity in the adult brain. We report that DCC is enriched in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in wild-type mice, and we demonstrate that selective deletion of DCC from neurons in the adult forebrain results in the loss of long-term potentiation (LTP), intact long-term depression, shorter dendritic spines, and impaired spatial and recognition memory. LTP induction requires Src activation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function. DCC deletion severely reduced Src activation. We demonstrate that enhancing NMDAR function or activating Src rescues LTP in the absence of DCC. We conclude that DCC activation of Src is required for NMDAR-dependent LTP and certain forms of learning and memory.

Tcf15 Primes Pluripotent Cells for Differentiation,

Abstract: Summary
The events that prime pluripotent cells for differentiation are not well understood. Inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation (Id) proteins, which are inhibitors of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor activity, contribute to pluripotency by blocking sequential transitions toward differentiation. Using yeast-two-hybrid screens, we have identified Id-regulated transcription factors that are expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). One of these, Tcf15, is also expressed in the embryonic day 4.5 embryo and is specifically associated with a novel subpopulation of primed ESCs. An Id-resistant form of Tcf15 rapidly downregulates Nanog and accelerates somatic lineage commitment. We propose that because Tcf15 can be held in an inactive state through Id activity, it may prime pluripotent cells for entry to somatic lineages upon downregulation of Id. We also find that Tcf15 expression is dependent on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, providing an explanation for how FGF can prime for differentiation without driving cells out of the pluripotent state.

Loss of p53 in Enterocytes Generates an Inflammatory Microenvironment Enabling Invasion and Lymph Node Metastasis of Carcinogen-Induced Colorectal Tumors,

Abstract: Summary
Loss of p53 is considered to allow progression of colorectal tumors from the adenoma to the carcinoma stage. Using mice with an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific p53 deletion, we demonstrate that loss of p53 alone is insufficient to initiate intestinal tumorigenesis but markedly enhances carcinogen-induced tumor incidence and leads to invasive cancer and lymph node metastasis. Whereas p53 controls DNA damage and IEC survival during the initiation stage, loss of p53 during tumor progression is associated with increased intestinal permeability, causing formation of an NF-κB-dependent inflammatory microenvironment and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, we propose a p53-controlled tumor-suppressive function that is independent of its well-established role in cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and senescence.

Abstract: Peripheral astrocytic processes (PAPs) are highly motile structures that are strategically positioned in close proximity to synapses. Long-lasting PAP retraction in hypothalamus is known to alter synaptic transmission [1]. The PAP motility is likely to be actin-based because they are known to contain actin-related proteins such as Ezrin [2]. However, the link between dynamic activity-dependent changes in astrocytic morphology and the synaptic function has not been established experimentally, presumably due to lack of appropriate tools. To selectively suppress activity-dependent morphological plasticity of astrocytes, we developed a bicistronic construct that allows simultaneous tracing and manipulating the morphology of PAPs. The construct is designed for co-expression of (i) the mutant actin binding protein Profilin-1 (abdProf-1) with a single amino acid substitution (H119E) that prevents its binding to actin monomers [3] with (ii) the membrane-targeted morphological tracer LckGFP [4]. Cultured cortical astrocytes transfected with this construct showed abdProf-1 overexpression at a 5-fold level compared to the endogenous Profilin-1. The cells also expressed LckGFP at a level sufficient for precise morphological tracing. We found that photolysis of caged Ca2+ induced a pronounced outgrowth of PAPs, which was suppressed by abdProf-1 overexpression in terms of PAP number, growth rate and maximal length. In contrast, the morphological complexity of astrocytes, basal motility of their PAPs and major cytoskeletal structures were not affected by abdProf-1 overexpression. In summary, we identified the actin binding by Profilin-1 as a pivotal mechanism in activity-dependent morphological plasticity of PAPs in cultured astrocytes.

Abstract: Increased Rac1 activity and its concomitant elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels is believed to be involved in the development of cardiac diseases such as hypertrophy and arrhythmia. To study the effects of activated Rac1 on the properties of isolated ventricular myocytes we used a transgenic mouse model (RacET) expressing constitutively active Rac1. Concurrent with dilated cardiomyopathy global Ca2+ handling as well as single cell contractility was substantially decreased. Cellular ROS levels were assessed with two independent assays and unexpectedly depicted decreased ROS production in RacET that was uncoupled from hormonal stimulation. Western blot analysis illustrated a massive increase in cellular Rac1 activity concomitant with a reduction in NADPH-oxidase activity. Analysis of the Ca2+ current, the ryanodine receptor and fractional Ca2+ release uncovered defective excitation–contraction (ec) coupling and a substantial increase in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak together with a larger Ca2+ spark amplitude and frequency. We conclude that Rac1 activity plays an important role for cardiac diseases but can be uncoupled from NADPH-oxidase activity. Rac1-mediated partial uncoupling of the ec-coupling machinery results in a ROS-independent disarrayed cellular Ca2+ handling, contractility and impaired cardiac function.

Cotranslational Response to Proteotoxic Stress by Elongation Pausing of Ribosomes,

Abstract: Summary
Translational control permits cells to respond swiftly to a changing environment. Rapid attenuation of global protein synthesis under stress conditions has been largely ascribed to the inhibition of translation initiation. Here we report that intracellular proteotoxic stress reduces global protein synthesis by halting ribosomes on transcripts during elongation. Deep sequencing of ribosome-protected messenger RNA (mRNA) fragments reveals an early elongation pausing, roughly at the site where nascent polypeptide chains emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel. Inhibiting endogenous chaperone molecules by a dominant-negative mutant or chemical inhibitors recapitulates the early elongation pausing, suggesting a dual role of molecular chaperones in facilitating polypeptide elongation and cotranslational folding. Our results further support the chaperone “trapping” mechanism in promoting the passage of nascent chains. Our study reveals that translating ribosomes fine tune the elongation rate by sensing the intracellular folding environment. The early elongation pausing represents a cotranslational stress response to maintain the intracellular protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Biological systems may perform reproducibly to generate invariant outcomes, despite external or internal noise. One example is the C. elegans vulva, in which the final cell fate pattern is remarkably robust. Although this system has been extensively studied and the molecular network underlying cell fate specification is well understood, very little is known in quantitative terms. Here, through pathway dosage modulation and single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show that the system can tolerate a 4-fold variation in genetic dose of the upstream signaling molecule LIN-3/epidermal growth factor (EGF) without phenotypic change in cell fate pattern. Furthermore, through tissue-specific dosage perturbations of the EGF and Notch pathways, we determine the first-appearing patterning errors. Finally, by combining different doses of both pathways, we explore how quantitative pathway interactions influence system behavior. Our results highlight the feasibility and significance of launching experimental studies of robustness and quantitative network analysis in genetically tractable, multicellular eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes, the loading of the replicative helicase MCM2-7 onto DNA requires the combined activities of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1. These proteins load MCM2-7 in an unknown way into a double hexamer around DNA. Here we show that MCM2-7 recruitment by ORC/Cdc6 is blocked by an autoinhibitory domain in the C terminus of Mcm6. Interestingly, Cdt1 can overcome this inhibitory activity, and consequently the Cdt1-MCM2-7 complex activates ORC/Cdc6 ATP-hydrolysis to promote helicase loading. While Cdc6 ATPase activity is known to facilitate Cdt1 release and MCM2-7 loading, we discovered that Orc1 ATP-hydrolysis is equally important in this process. Moreover, we found that Orc1/Cdc6 ATP-hydrolysis promotes the formation of the ORC/Cdc6/MCM2-7 (OCM) complex, which functions in MCM2-7 double-hexamer assembly. Importantly, CDK-dependent phosphorylation of ORC inhibits OCM establishment to ensure once per cell cycle replication. In summary, this work reveals multiple critical mechanisms that redefine our understanding of DNA licensing.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) from the extracellular space plays a critical role in agonist-mediated Ca2+ signaling in non-excitable cells. Here we show that SOCE is enhanced in COS-7 cells treated with staurosporine (ST), a protein kinase inhibitor. In COS-7 cells, stimulation with ATP induced Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space. Ca2+ release was not affected by treatment with ST, but Ca2+ entry continued in the ST-treated cells even after the removal of ATP. ST did not inhibit Ca2+ sequestration into Ca2+ stores. The Ca2+ entry induced by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a reversible ER Ca2+ pump inhibitor, was maintained in ST-treated cells even after the removal of CPA, but was not maintained in the control cells. The sustained Ca2+ entry in ST-treated cells was completely attenuated by the SOCE inhibitors, La3+ and 2-APB. The large increase in Ca2+ entry produced in the cells co-expressing Venus-Orai1 and STIM1-mKO1 was stabilized with ST treatment, and confocal imaging of these cells suggested that the complex between Orai1 and STIM1 did not completely dissociate following the refilling of Ca2+ stores. These results show that SOCE remains activated even after the refilling of Ca2+ stores in ST-treated cells and that the effect of ST on SOCE may result from a stabilization of the Orai1–STIM1 interaction.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to measure human aging from molecular profiles has practical implications in many fields, including disease prevention and treatment, forensics, and extension of life. Although chronological age has been linked to changes in DNA methylation, the methylome has not yet been used to measure and compare human aging rates. Here, we build a quantitative model of aging using measurements at more than 450,000 CpG markers from the whole blood of 656 human individuals, aged 19 to 101. This model measures the rate at which an individual's methylome ages, which we show is impacted by gender and genetic variants. We also show that differences in aging rates help explain epigenetic drift and are reflected in the transcriptome. Moreover, we show how our aging model is upheld in other human tissues and reveals an advanced aging rate in tumor tissue. Our model highlights specific components of the aging process and provides a quantitative readout for studying the role of methylation in age-related disease.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving efficient cotranslational folding of complex proteomes poses a challenge for eukaryotic cells. Nascent polypeptides that emerge vectorially from the ribosome often cannot fold stably and may be susceptible to misfolding and degradation. The extent to which nascent chains are subject to cotranslational quality control and degradation remains unclear. Here, we directly and quantitatively assess cotranslational ubiquitination and identify, at a systems level, the determinants and factors governing this process. Cotranslational ubiquitination occurs at very low levels and is carried out by a complex network of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Ribosome-associated chaperones and cotranslational folding protect the majority of nascent chains from premature quality control. Nonetheless, a number of nascent chains whose intrinsic properties hinder efficient cotranslational folding remain susceptible for cotranslational ubiquitination. We find that quality control at the ribosome is achieved through a tiered system wherein nascent polypeptides have a chance to fold before becoming accessible to ubiquitination.

Abstract: Berberine (BBR) is one of the major alkaloids and has been reported to have a variety of pharmacologic effects, including inhibition of cell cycle progression. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of BBR protection of neuronal cells from cell death induced by the Parkinson’s disease-related neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with BBR significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase-3 activation, and subsequent cell death. BBR also upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, which conferred protection against 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron injury and besides, effect of BBR on HO-1 was reversed by siRNA-Nrf2. Furthermore, BBR induced PI3K/ Akt and p38 activation, which are involved in the induction of Nrf2 expression and neuroprotection. These results suggest that BBR may be useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of dopaminergic neuronal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) in Drosophila are processed by Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) and loaded onto Ago2 by the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer. In r2d2 mutants, the level of endo-siRNAs is unchanged, but endo-siRNAs are misloaded onto Ago1. However, the mechanism underlying the control of endo-siRNA sorting by R2D2 remains unknown. Here, we show that R2D2 controls endo-siRNA sorting by localizing Dcr-2, and presumably endo-siRNA duplexes, to cytoplasmic foci, D2 bodies. Ago2, but not Ago1, localized to D2 bodies. dsRNA-binding-deficient mutant, but not wild-type, R2D2 failed to localize D2 bodies and caused endo-siRNA misdirection to Ago1 in R2D2-depleted cells. However, R2D2 was dispensable for sorting miRNAs and exogenous siRNAs onto Ago1 and Ago2, respectively, in vivo. Endo- and exo-siRNA guide selection also occurred R2D2 independently. The functions of R2D2 are required to avoid endo-siRNA misdirection to Ago1, because Ago1 is capable of loading incompletely complementary miRNA duplexes and endo-siRNA duplexes.

Abstract: Motility of mitochondria, as well as their activity-dependent immobilization (“trapping”), is essential for neuronal function, but its regulation by cytoskeleton and relevance for glial cell signalling are unknown. Using time-lapse fluorescence imaging in rat cultured astrocytes, we evaluated the role of microtubules and actin filaments in motility of mitochondria in resting cells and during physiological or pathological Ca2+ elevations. We found that mitochondria were significantly more aligned with microtubules than with actin filaments. Mitochondria were highly mobile under resting conditions at low intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i). Activation of a moderate increase in [Ca2+]i by either low-dose ionomycin or ATP immobilized mitochondria significantly but reversibly, without affecting mitochondrial morphology. A larger dose of ionomycin caused irreversible arrest and fragmentation of mitochondria. Disruption of microtubules completely arrested mitochondrial motility, while disruption of actin filaments had no effect on the basal mitochondrial motility at resting [Ca2+]i levels but significantly reduced mitochondrial immobilization during [Ca2+]i elevations. These results suggest that: (i) motility of astrocytic mitochondria is inversely related to [Ca2+]i, (ii) mitochondria require intact microtubules for their motility, and (iii) elevated [Ca2+]i immobilizes mitochondria by strengthening their interaction with actin filaments.

Abstract: Summary
The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) provides patterning information during vertebrate embryogenesis, but the mechanism through which RA influences limb development is unclear. During patterning of the limb proximodistal axis (upper limb to digits), avian studies suggest that a proximal RA signal generated in the trunk antagonizes a distal fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal. However, mouse and zebrafish genetic studies suggest that loss of RA suppresses forelimb initiation. Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that limb proximodistal patterning is not RA dependent, thus indicating that RA-FGF antagonism does not occur along the proximodistal axis of the limb. Instead, our studies show that RA-FGF antagonism acts prior to limb budding along the anteroposterior axis of the trunk lateral plate mesoderm to provide a patterning cue that guides formation of the forelimb field. These findings reconcile disparate ideas regarding RA-FGF antagonism and provide insight into how endogenous RA programs the early embryo.

Abstract: Summary
The spatiotemporal architecture of inflorescences that bear flowers determines plant reproductive success by affecting fruit set and plant interaction with pollinators. The inflorescence architecture that displays great diversity across flowering plants depends on developmental decisions at inflorescence meristems. Here we report a key conserved genetic pathway determining inflorescence architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). In Arabidopsis, four MADS-box genes, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, AGAMOUS-LIKE 24, and SEPALLATA 4 act redundantly and directly to suppress TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) in emerging floral meristems. This is indispensable for the well-known function of APETALA1 in specifying floral meristems and is coupled with a conformational change in chromosome looping at the TFL1 locus. Similarly, we demonstrate that the orthologs of these MADS-box genes in rice determine panicle branching by regulating TFL1-like genes. Our findings reveal a conserved regulatory pathway that determines inflorescence architecture in flowering plants.

Abstract: The egg-to-embryo transition marks the initiation of multicellular organismal development and is mediated by a specialized Ca2+ transient at fertilization. This explosive Ca2+ signal has captured the interest and imagination of scientists for many decades, given its cataclysmic nature and necessity for the egg-to-embryo transition. Learning how the egg acquires the competency to generate this Ca2+ transient at fertilization is essential to our understanding of the mechanisms controlling egg and the transition to embryogenesis. In this review we discuss our current knowledge of how Ca2+ signaling pathways remodel during oocyte maturation in preparation for fertilization with a special emphasis on the frog oocyte as additional reviews in this issue will touch on this in other species.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy constitutes a major cell-protective mechanism that eliminates damaged components and maintains energy homeostasis via recycling nutrients under normal/stressed conditions. Although the core components of autophagy have been well studied, regulation of autophagy at the transcriptional level is poorly understood. Herein, we establish ZKSCAN3, a zinc finger family DNA-binding protein, as a transcriptional repressor of autophagy. Silencing of ZKSCAN3 induced autophagy and increased lysosome biogenesis. Importantly, we show that ZKSCAN3 represses transcription of a large gene set (>60) integral to, or regulatory for, autophagy and lysosome biogenesis/function and that a subset of these genes, including Map1lC3b and Wipi2, represent direct targets. Interestingly, ZKSCAN3 and TFEB are oppositely regulated by starvation and in turn oppositely regulate lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, suggesting that they act in conjunction. Altogether, our study uncovers an autophagy master switch regulating the expression of a transcriptional network of genes integral to autophagy and lysosome biogenesis/function.

Abstract: Chronic inflammation plays an important role in atherogenesis. Experimental studies have demonstrated the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques caused by inflammation. Here, we report the inhibitory effects of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Lactobacillus plantarum (pLTA) on atherosclerotic inflammation. pLTA inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells and alleviated THP-1 cell adhesion to HUVEC by down-regulation of adhesion molecules such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-I), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin. The inhibitory effect of pLTA was mediated by inhibition of NF-KB and activation of MAP kinases. Inhibition of monocyte/macrophage infiltration to the arterial lumen was shown in pLTAinjected ApoE-/-mice, which was concurrent with inhibition of MMP-9 and preservation of CD31 production. The antiinflammatory effect mediated by pLTA decreased expression of atherosclerotic markers such as COX-2, Bax, and HSP27 and also cell surface receptors such as TLR4 and CCR7. Together, these results underscore the role of pLTA in suppressing atherosclerotic plaque inflammation and will help in identifying targets with therapeutic potential against pathogen-mediated atherogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have indicated that 6%–30% of newly synthesized proteins are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system; however, the relationship of ubiquitination to translation for these proteins has been unclear. We report that cotranslational ubiquitination (CTU) is a robust process, with 12%–15% of nascent polypeptides being ubiquitinated in human cells. CTU products contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, consistent with a proteasomal targeting function. While nascent chains have been shown previously to be ubiquitinated within stalled complexes (CTUS), the majority of nascent chain ubiquitination occurred within active translation complexes (CTUA). CTUA was increased in response to agents that induce protein misfolding, while CTUS was increased in response to agents that lead to translational errors or stalling. These results indicate that ubiquitination of nascent polypeptides occurs in two contexts and define CTUA as a component of a quality control system that marks proteins for destruction while they are being synthesized.

Abstract: Summary
The ARF tumor suppressor is a central component of the cellular defense against oncogene activation in mammals. p14ARF activates p53 by binding and inhibiting HDM2, resulting, inter alia, in increased transcription and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and consequent cell-cycle arrest. We analyzed the effect of p14ARF induction on nucleolar protein dynamics using SILAC mass spectrometry and have identified the human Formin-2 (FMN2) protein as a component of the p14ARF tumor suppressor pathway. We show that FMN2 is increased upon p14ARF induction at both the mRNA and the protein level via a NF-κB-dependent mechanism that is independent of p53. FMN2 enhances expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 by preventing its degradation. FMN2 is also induced by activation of other oncogenes, hypoxia, and DNA damage. These results identify FMN2 as a crucial component in the regulation of p21 and consequent oncogene/stress-induced cell-cycle arrest in human cells.

Abstract: Tudor-SN (SND1, p100) has been shown to function as a transcriptional coactivator as well as a modulator of RNA metabolism and biogenesis and a component in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Tudor-SN consists of five repeats of staphylococcus nuclease-like domains (SN1–SN5) and, a Tudor domain implicated in binding to methylated ligands. The protein is highly conserved through evolution from fission yeast to mammals and it exists as a single gene without any close homologs. Tudor-SN is found to be overexpressed in several cancers such as colon adenocarcinomas and prostate cancer. The conservation of Tudor-SN along evolution suggests it may have important functions; however, the physiological function of Tudor-SN has not yet been characterized. In this study we analyzed the expression and localization of Tudor-SN in mouse tissues and organs by immunohistochemistry, fluorescent immunostaining, Western blotting and RT-qPCR. Expression analysis indicated that Tudor-SN is widely expressed in most organs with the exception of muscle cells. Up-regulated expression was observed in rapidly dividing cells and progenitor cells such as in spermatogonial cells in testis, in the follicular cells of ovary, in the cells of crypts of Lieberkühn of ileum and basal keratinocytes of skin and hair follicle when compared to more differentiated or terminally differentiated cells in the respective organs. Moreover, Tudor-SN was robustly expressed in T-cells and Tudor-SN was co-expressed with CD3 in T-cells in the Peyer's patch, spleen and lymph node. The wide expression pattern of Tudor-SN and high expression in proliferating and self-differentiating cells suggests that the protein serves functions related to activated state of cells.

Abstract: Summary
A common thread among conserved life span regulators lies within intertwined roles in metabolism and energy homeostasis. We show that heterozygous mutations of AMP biosynthetic enzymes extend Drosophila life span. The life span benefit of these mutations depends upon increased AMP:ATP and ADP:ATP ratios and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Transgenic expression of AMPK in adult fat body or adult muscle, key metabolic tissues, extended life span, while AMPK RNAi reduced life span. Supplementing adenine, a substrate for AMP biosynthesis, to the diet of long-lived AMP biosynthesis mutants reversed life span extension. Remarkably, this simple change in diet also blocked the prolongevity effects of dietary restriction. These data establish AMP biosynthesis, adenosine nucleotide ratios, and AMPK as determinants of adult life span; provide a mechanistic link between cellular anabolism and energy sensing pathways; and indicate that dietary adenine manipulations might alter metabolism to influence animal life span.

Abstract: The testes of two Clarias species from the Okavango Delta Panhandle were histomorphologically assessed for differences in structure mainly because the testes varied externally in colour, with Clarias ngamensis having black testes while those of Clarias gariepinus were off-white. Although a detailed histological description of normal testes in C. gariepinus has been compiled based on laboratory experimentation, there is limited histomorphological field data available on both species which could be used as reference material in the histology and histomorphology assessment of gonads both in the laboratory and field experiments. In August 2006 and 2007 fifteen fish per species of C. ngamensis and C. gariepinus were collected from the Shakawe Panhandle in the Okavango Delta. Testicular samples excised from the fish were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and later transported to the University of Johannesburg where laboratory analyses using standard histological procedures were conducted. Microscopic assessments were used to describe the testicular morphology and the reproductive developmental stages. Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS), Perl's Prussian Blue and Gordon and Sweets Silver Stain Solution were used to enhance finer cellular detail and the morphology of various structures present in the catfish testes. Results emanating from this study (a) form a histomorphological baseline set of data from an undisturbed wetland system for comparison between normal morphology and anomalies within the catfish species, (b) contribute to the limited database of the normal histomorphology of gonads in Southern African freshwater fish species and (c) expand the academic knowledge and skills required for the conservation of wetland ecosystems in Southern Africa.

Abstract: Summary
Gambogic acid (GA) is a natural compound derived from Chinese herbs that has been approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials in cancer patients; however, its molecular targets have not been thoroughly studied. Here, we report that GA inhibits tumor proteasome activity, with potency comparable to bortezomib but much less toxicity. First, GA acts as a prodrug and only gains proteasome-inhibitory function after being metabolized by intracellular CYP2E1. Second, GA-induced proteasome inhibition is a prerequisite for its cytotoxicity and anticancer effect without off-targets. Finally, because expression of the CYP2E1 gene is very high in tumor tissues but low in many normal tissues, GA could therefore produce tissue-specific proteasome inhibition and tumor-specific toxicity, with clinical significance for designing novel strategies for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The identification and targeted therapy of cells involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence remain challenging. Here, we generated a monoclonal antibody against recurrent HCC, 1B50-1, that bound the isoform 5 of the α2δ1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and identified a subset of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) with stem cell-like properties. A surgical margin with cells detected by 1B50-1 predicted rapid recurrence. Furthermore, 1B50-1 had a therapeutic effect on HCC engraftments by eliminating TICs. Finally, α2δ1 knockdown reduced self-renewal and tumor formation capacities and induced apoptosis of TICs, whereas its overexpression led to enhanced sphere formation, which is regulated by calcium influx. Thus, α2δ1 is a functional liver TIC marker, and its inhibitors may serve as potential anti-HCC drugs.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, precise placement of organs is essential for survival. We show here that inactivation of Roundabout (Robo) receptors 1 and 2 in mice leads to mispositioning of the stomach in the thoracic instead of the abdominal cavity, which likely contributes to poor lung inflation and lethality at birth, reminiscent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) cases in humans. Unexpectedly, in Robo mutant mice, the primary defect preceding organ misplacement and diaphragm malformation is a delayed separation of foregut from the dorsal body wall. Foregut separation is a rarely considered morphogenetic event, and our data indicate that it occurs via repulsion of Robo-expressing foregut cells away from the Slit ligand source. In humans, genomic lesions containing Robo genes have been documented in CDH. Our findings suggest that separation of the foregut from the body wall is genetically controlled and that defects in this event may contribute to CDH.

Abstract: Summary
The androgen receptor (AR) regulates prostate cell growth in man, and prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men in the UK. We present a comprehensive analysis of AR binding sites in human prostate cancer tissues, including castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We identified thousands of AR binding sites in CRPC tissue, most of which were not identified in PC cell lines. Many adjacent genes showed AR regulation in xenografts but not in cultured LNCaPs, demonstrating an in-vivo-restricted set of AR-regulated genes. Functional studies support a model of altered signaling in vivo that directs AR binding. We identified a 16 gene signature that outperformed a larger in-vitro-derived signature in clinical data sets, showing the importance of persistent AR signaling in CRPC.

Abstract: Summary
Intermittent fasting is one of the most effective dietary restriction regimens that extend life span in C. elegans and mammals. Fasting-stimulus responses are key to the longevity response; however, the mechanisms that sense and transduce the fasting stimulus remain largely unknown. Through a comprehensive transcriptome analysis in C. elegans, we find that along with the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, AP-1 (JUN-1/FOS-1) plays a central role in fasting-induced transcriptional changes. KGB-1, one of the C. elegans JNKs, acts as an activator of AP-1 and is activated in response to fasting. KGB-1 and AP-1 are involved in intermittent fasting-induced longevity. Fasting-induced upregulation of the components of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex via AP-1 and DAF-16 enhances protein ubiquitination and reduces protein carbonylation. Our results thus identify a fasting-responsive KGB-1/AP-1 signaling pathway, which, together with DAF-16, causes transcriptional changes that mediate longevity, partly through regulating proteostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Tet enzymes (Tet1/2/3) convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in various embryonic and adult tissues. Mice mutant for either Tet1 or Tet2 are viable, raising the question of whether these enzymes have overlapping roles in development. Here we have generated Tet1 and Tet2 double-knockout (DKO) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mice. DKO ESCs remained pluripotent but were depleted of 5hmC and caused developmental defects in chimeric embryos. While a fraction of double-mutant embryos exhibited midgestation abnormalities with perinatal lethality, viable and overtly normal Tet1/Tet2-deficient mice were also obtained. DKO mice had reduced 5hmC and increased 5mC levels and abnormal methylation at various imprinted loci. Nevertheless, animals of both sexes were fertile, with females having smaller ovaries and reduced fertility. Our data show that loss of both enzymes is compatible with development but promotes hypermethylation and compromises imprinting. The data also suggest a significant contribution of Tet3 to hydroxylation of 5mC during development.

Abstract: The characteristics and distributions of cholecystokinin (CCK)-producing cells and mucus-secreting goblet cells were investigated in the digestive tract of the blacktip grouper (Epinephelus fasciatus). CCK-producing cells were scattered throughout the digestive tract. The highest frequency of CCK-producing cells was observed in the anterior intestine portion and pyloric ceca, with a very small number of cells distributed as far as the rectum. Mucus-secreting goblet cells were found to differ remarkably in their regional distributions and relative frequencies. High frequencies of mucus-secreting goblet cells were found in the digestive tract, mainly in the anterior intestine portion and pyloric ceca, but not the esophagus; the frequency decreased slightly toward the rectum. Our result suggests that food digested by gastric acid in the stomach moves on the anterior (including the pyloric ceca) and mid intestine portion, thereby ensuring effective stimulation of the CCK-producing cells. In addition, the distribution pattern of the CCK-producing cells closely resembled that of mucus-secreting goblet cells. In E. fasciatus, CCK-producing cells and mucus-secreting goblet cells seem to be well adapted to promoting optimal control of the digestive process.

Abstract: Summary
RNA viruses are sensed by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which signal through a mitochondria-associated adaptor molecule, MAVS, resulting in systemic antiviral immune responses. Although RLR signaling is essential for limiting RNA virus replication, it must be stringently controlled to prevent damage from inflammation. We demonstrate here that among all tested UBX-domain-containing protein family members, UBXN1 exhibits the strongest inhibitory effect on RNA-virus-induced type I interferon response. UBXN1 potently inhibits RLR- and MAVS-induced, but not TLR3-, TLR4-, or DNA-virus-induced innate immune responses. Depletion of UBXN1 enhances virus-induced innate immune responses, including those resulting from RNA viruses such as vesicular stomatitis, Sendai, West Nile, and dengue virus infection, repressing viral replication. Following viral infection, UBXN1 is induced, binds to MAVS, interferes with intracellular MAVS oligomerization, and disrupts the MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome. These findings underscore a critical role of UBXN1 in the modulation of a major antiviral signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory bowel disease is an important risk factor for colorectal cancer. We show that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) produced by upregulation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) links chronic intestinal inflammation to colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and both are exacerbated by deletion of Sphk2. S1P is essential for production of the multifunctional NF-κB-regulated cytokine IL-6, persistent activation of the transcription factor STAT3, and consequent upregulation of the S1P receptor, S1PR1. The prodrug FTY720 decreased SphK1 and S1PR1 expression and eliminated the NF-κB/IL-6/STAT3 amplification cascade and development of CAC, even in Sphk2−/− mice, and may be useful in treating colon cancer in individuals with ulcerative colitis. Thus, the SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 axis is at the nexus between NF-κB and STAT3 and connects chronic inflammation and CAC.

Abstract: Summary
Activating mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma. Inhibition of BRAF by small molecules leads to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We show here that BRAF inhibition also induces an oxidative phosphorylation gene program, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the increased expression of the mitochondrial master regulator, PGC1α. We further show that a target of BRAF, the melanocyte lineage factor MITF, directly regulates the expression of PGC1α. Melanomas with activation of the BRAF/MAPK pathway have suppressed levels of MITF and PGC1α and decreased oxidative metabolism. Conversely, treatment of BRAF-mutated melanomas with BRAF inhibitors renders them addicted to oxidative phosphorylation. Our data thus identify an adaptive metabolic program that limits the efficacy of BRAF inhibitors.

Abstract: Several recent reports have demonstrated how engineered proteins can control cell motility, an important functional module for ultimately programming cells as therapeutics. We have reported two engineered proteins that regulate the blebbing cell morphology using chimeras of RhoA, a protein that regulates cytoskeletal tension. Here, we show that engineered switching of blebbing can be used to regulate cell motility. First, the analysis of morphology and motility characteristics showed that blebbing cells wobbled, or shifted, faster and less linearly than cells with a wild type morphology. Second, activating engineered protein switches that regulate cell morphology led to predictable changes in motility characteristics. Last, exogenous stimuli such as blue light, acetylcholine and VEGF-A were used to show that groups of proteins could cooperatively increase cell motility in vitro. This work demonstrates that control of RhoA can program the motility patterns of living cells and has implications in studying the relationship between cell morphology and motility.

Abstract: Summary
WASH causes actin to polymerize on vesicles involved in retrograde traffic and exocytosis. It is found within a regulatory complex, but the physiological roles of the other four members are unknown. Here we present genetic analysis of the subunits’ individual functions in Dictyostelium. Mutants in each subunit are completely blocked in exocytosis. All subunits except FAM21 are required to drive actin assembly on lysosomes. Without actin, lysosomes never recycle vacuolar-type H+-adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) or neutralize to form postlysosomes. However, in FAM21 knockout lysosomes, WASH generates excessive, dynamic streams of actin. These successfully remove V-ATPase, neutralize, and form huge postlysosomes. The distinction between WASH and FAM21 phenotypes is conserved in human cells. Thus, FAM21 and WASH act at different steps of a cyclical pathway in which FAM21 mediates recycling of the complex back to acidic lysosomes. Recycling is driven by FAM21’s interaction with capping protein, which couples the WASH complex to dynamic actin on vesicles.

Abstract: Summary
O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (Ogt) activity is essential for embryonic stem cell (ESC) viability and mouse development. Ogt is present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of different cell types and catalyzes serine and threonine glycosylation. We have characterized the biochemical features of nuclear Ogt and identified the ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins Tet1 and Tet2 as stable partners of Ogt in the nucleus of ESCs. We show at a genome-wide level that Ogt preferentially associates with Tet1 to genes promoters in close proximity of CpG-rich transcription start sites. These regions are characterized by low levels of DNA modification, suggesting a link between Tet1 and Ogt activities in regulating CpG island methylation. Finally, we show that Tet1 is required for binding of Ogt to chromatin affecting Tet1 activity. Taken together, our data characterize how O-GlcNAcylation is recruited to chromatin and interacts with the activity of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases.

Abstract: Summary
The LKB1 (also called STK11) tumor suppressor is mutationally inactivated in ∼20% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). LKB1 is the major upstream kinase activating the energy-sensing kinase AMPK, making LKB1-deficient cells unable to appropriately sense metabolic stress. We tested the therapeutic potential of metabolic drugs in NSCLC and identified phenformin, a mitochondrial inhibitor and analog of the diabetes therapeutic metformin, as selectively inducing apoptosis in LKB1-deficient NSCLC cells. Therapeutic trials in Kras-dependent mouse models of NSCLC revealed that tumors with Kras and Lkb1 mutations, but not those with Kras and p53 mutations, showed selective response to phenformin as a single agent, resulting in prolonged survival. This study suggests phenformin as a cancer metabolism-based therapeutic to selectively target LKB1-deficient tumors.

Abstract: Notch signaling is often involved in early development which helps to determine the differentiation state and fate of stem cells destined to form different tissues in the body. Its role in the differentiation of BM-MSCs (bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) is much less clear. As there is great interest in the potential of BM-MSCs as a source of cells for treating liver damage, it is important to understand if Notch signaling promotes or suppresses BM-MSCs differentiation into hepatocytes. In the present study, RT-PCR, Western blot results and morphologic changes demonstrated that BM-MSCs could successfully differentiate into hepatocytes in our special induction system including the tissue extract of damaged liver. On the 21st day when the differentiation direction was determined in BM-MSCs, the mRNA level of Jagged2, Delta1, Delta3, Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Presenilin1, was significantly lower than that on days 0, 7, and 11. In the further experiments, down-regulation of Notch signaling was shown to be critical for BM-MSCs to differentiate into hepatocytes, as increased Jagged1 resulted in up-regulated Notch activation leading to higher levels of expression of Hes1 and Hey1, which completely blocked Albumin expresion in BM-MSCs. These results in our study showed that Notch signaling in BM-MSCs was necessary to initiate differentiation into hepatocytes, but must be down-regulated for the differentiation to proceed continuously.

Abstract: Summary
Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) is highly expressed in adipose tissue. Its role, however, has not been fully elucidated. Here, we reveal the metabolic role of adipose-VEGF by studying mice with deletion (VEGFAdΔ) or doxycycline-inducible overexpression of a VEGF transgene (VEGFAdTg) in the adipose tissue. VEGFAdΔ mice have reduced adipose vascular density and show adipose hypoxia, apoptosis, inflammation, and metabolic defects on a high-fat diet. In contrast, induction of VEGF expression in VEGFAdTg mice leads to increased adipose vasculature and reduced hypoxia. The latter changes are sufficient to counteract an established compromising effect of high-fat diet on the metabolism, indicating that metabolic misbalance is reversible by adipose vessel density increase. Our data clearly show the essential role of VEGF signaling for adequate adipose function. Besides revealing insights into the molecular mechanisms of obesity-related metabolic diseases, this study points to the therapeutic potential of increased adipose angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
In stroke and proliferative retinopathy, despite hypoxia driven angiogenesis, delayed revascularization of ischemic tissue aggravates the loss of neuronal function. What hinders vascular regrowth in the ischemic central nervous system remains largely unknown. Using the ischemic retina as a model of neurovascular interaction in the CNS, we provide evidence that the failure of reparative angiogenesis is temporally and spatially associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The canonical ER stress pathways of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α) are activated within hypoxic/ischemic retinal ganglion neurons, initiating a cascade that results in angiostatic signals. Our findings demonstrate that the endoribonuclease IRE1α degrades the classical guidance cue netrin-1. This neuron-derived cue triggers a critical reparative-angiogenic switch in neural macrophage/microglial cells. Degradation of netrin-1, by persistent neuronal ER stress, thereby hinders vascular regeneration. These data identify a neuronal-immune mechanism that directly regulates reparative angiogenesis.

Abstract: Closure and biological repair of anulus fibrosus (AF) defects in intervertebral disc diseases is a therapeutic challenge. The aim of our study was to evaluate the anabolic properties of bioactive factors on cartilaginous matrix formation by AF cells. Human AF cells were harvested from degenerated lumbar AF tissue and expanded in monolayer culture. AF cell differentiation and matrix formation was initiated by forming pellet cultures and stimulation with hyaluronic acid (HA), human serum (HS), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) and TGF-β3/FGF-2 for up to 4 weeks. Matrix formation was assessed histologically by staining of proteoglycan, type I and type II collagens and by gene expression analysis of typical extracellular matrix molecules and of catabolic matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-13. AF cells, stimulated with HS, FGF-2 and most pronounced with TGF-β3 or TGF-β3/FGF-2 formed a cartilaginous matrix with significantly enhanced expression of matrix molecules and of MMP-13. Stimulation of AF cells with TGF-β3 was accompanied by induction of type X collagen, known to occur in hypertrophic cartilage cells having mineralizing potential. HA did not show any chondro-inductive characteristics. These findings suggest human serum, FGF-2 and TGF-β3 as possible candidates to support biological treatment strategies of AF defects.

Abstract: To investigate the expression patterns of Msi1 and its relationship with tumour grading and angiogenesis in human glioma. Msi1 expression and the angiogenesis labelled by CD31 were detected by immunohistochemical staining in glioma from Grade I to Grade IV. MVD–CD31 was counted respectively in nuclear and cytoplasmic positive areas of Msi1. There was weak expression of Msi1 in the adjacent normal brain tissue of glioma, and there were less MVD–CD31 than in glioma. Glioma showed strong expression and different patterns of Msi1. From Grade I to Grade IV glioma, the expression pattern of Msi1 was changed from nuclear into cytoplasmic pattern gradually (P<0.05), and the expression patterns of Msi1 were related with the angiogenesis of glioma (P<0.05). It suggested that cytoplasmic Msi1 promoted angiogenesis and nuclear Msi-1 inhibited angiogenesis in glioma (P<0.05). Msi1 has different expression patterns in glioma from Grade I to Grade IV, and the different expression patterns play diverse roles in angiogenesis of glioma. This might explain that from Grade I to IV, glioma showed worse and worse prognosis.

Abstract: Background
In Type 1 diabetes, the insulin-producing β-cells within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans are destroyed. We showed previously that immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice can prevent disease process and pancreatic β-cell loss. This was associated with increased islet Regenerating (Reg) genes expression, and elevated IL-22-producing Th17 T-cells in the pancreas.
Results
We hypothesized that IL-22 was responsible for the increased Reg gene expression in the pancreas. We therefore quantified the Reg1, Reg2, and Reg 3δ (INGAP) mRNA expression in isolated pre-diabetic NOD islets treated with IL-22. We measured IL-22, and IL-22 receptor(R)- α mRNA expression in the pancreas and spleen of pre-diabetic and diabetic NOD mice. Our results showed: 1) Reg1 and Reg2 mRNA abundance to be significantly increased in IL-22-treated islets in vitro; 2) IL-22 mRNA expression in the pre-diabetic mouse pancreas increased with time following CFA treatment; 3) a reduced expression of IL-22R α following CFA treatment; 4) a down-regulation in Reg1 and Reg 2 mRNA expression in the pancreas of pre-diabetic mice injected with an IL-22 neutralizing antibody; and 5) an increased islet β-cell DNA synthesis in vitro in the presence of IL-22.
Conclusions
We conclude that IL-22 may contribute to the regeneration of β-cells by up-regulating Regenerating Reg1 and Reg2 genes in the islets.

Abstract: Summary
The utilization of stored RNA is a driving force in rapid development. Here, we show that retention and subsequent removal of introns from pre-mRNAs regulate temporal patterns of translation during rapid and posttranscriptionally controlled spermatogenesis of the fern Marsilea vestita. Analysis of RNAseq-derived transcriptomes revealed a large subset of intron-retaining transcripts (IRTs) that encode proteins essential for gamete development. Genomic and IRT sequence comparisons show that other introns have been previously removed from the IRT pre-mRNAs. Fully spliced isoforms appear at distinct times during development in a spliceosome-dependent and transcription-independent manner. RNA interference knockdowns of 17/17 IRTs produced anomalies after the time points when those transcripts would normally be spliced. Intron retention is a functional mechanism for forestalling precocious translation of transcripts in the male gametophyte of M. vestita. These results have broad implications for plant gene regulation, where intron retention is widespread.

Abstract: Release of neurotransmitters is a fundamental and regulated process that is essential for normal brain functioning. Regulation of this process is potentially important for any neuronal process, and disruption of the release process may contribute to the pathophysiology associated with psychiatric diseases. In this work it is shown that expression of the negative regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling the MAPK phosphatase MKP3/DUSP6 eliminates depolarization-dependent release of dopamine in rat PC12 cells. Pharmacologic interventions with latrotroxin (LTX) or A23187, which make the cells permeable to calcium, reestablish the dopamine release. Calcium imaging also reveals that calcium influx is impaired in MKP3-expressing cells. Because acute pharmacologic inhibition of MAPKs has no effect on dopamine release in naïve PC12 cells, the MKP3-mediated elimination of neurotransmitter release must be caused by a long-term process, such as changes in gene expression. In support of this the expression of the L-type calcium channel cav1.2 alpha subunit (Cacna1c) is decreased in MKP3-expressing PC12 cells. With the reintroduction of cav1.2 expression, neurotransmitter release is restored in the MKP3-expressing PC12 cells. Thus, MKP3 expression reduces neurotransmitter release by decreasing the expression of cav1.2. Because MKP3 is increased when neuronal activity is elevated, this process could play a role in regulating neurotransmitter homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Most patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) fail current treatments highlighting the need for better therapies. Because oncogenic signaling activates a p53-dependent DNA damage response and apoptosis, leukemic cells must devise appropriate countermeasures. We show here that growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1) can serve such a function because Gfi1 ablation exacerbates p53 responses and lowers the threshold for p53-induced cell death. Specifically, Gfi1 restricts p53 activity and expression of proapoptotic p53 targets such as Bax, Noxa (Pmaip1), and Puma (Bbc3). Subsequently, Gfi1 ablation cures mice from leukemia and limits the expansion of primary human T-ALL xenografts in mice. This suggests that targeting Gfi1 could improve the prognosis of patients with T-ALL or other lymphoid leukemias.

Abstract: Symbiotic nodule formation on legume roots is characterized with a series of developmental reprograming in root tissues, including extensive proliferation of cortical cells. We examined a possible involvement of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation in animals and yeasts, during soybean nodule development. Our results show that transcription of both GmTOR and its key downstream effector, GmS6K1, are activated during nodulation, which is paralleled with higher kinase activities of these gene products as well. RNAi-mediated knockdown of GmS6K1 impaired the nodule development with severely reduced nodule weight and numbers. In addition, expression of a few nodulins including leghemoglobin was also decreased, and consequently nitrogen fixation was found to be reduced by half. Proteomic analysis of the GmS6K1-RNAi nodules identified glutamine synthetase (GS), an essential enzyme for nitrogen assimilation in nodules, as one of the proteins that are significantly down regulated. These results appear to provide solid evidence for a functional link between GmS6K1 and nodule development.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an energy-dispensing thermogenic tissue that plays an important role in balancing energy metabolism. Lineage-tracing experiments indicate that brown adipocytes are derived from myogenic progenitors during embryonic development. However, adult skeletal muscle stem cells (satellite cells) have long been considered uniformly determined toward the myogenic lineage. Here, we report that adult satellite cells give rise to brown adipocytes and that microRNA-133 regulates the choice between myogenic and brown adipose determination by targeting the 3′UTR of Prdm16. Antagonism of microRNA-133 during muscle regeneration increases uncoupled respiration, glucose uptake, and thermogenesis in local treated muscle and augments whole-body energy expenditure, improves glucose tolerance, and impedes the development of diet-induced obesity. Finally, we demonstrate that miR-133 levels are downregulated in mice exposed to cold, resulting in de novo generation of satellite cell-derived brown adipocytes. Therefore, microRNA-133 represents an important therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity.

Abstract: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are the pacemaker cells that generate the rhythmic oscillation responsible for the production of slow waves in gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Spingolipids are known to present in digestive system and are responsible for multiple important physiological and pathological processes. In this study, we are interested in the action of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) on ICC. S1P depolarized the membrane and increased tonic inward pacemaker currents. FTY720 phosphate (FTY720P, an S1P1,3,4,5 agonist) and SEW 2871 (an S1P1 agonist) had no effects on pacemaker activity. Suramin (an S1P3 antagonist) did not block the S1P-induced action on pacemaker currents. However, JTE-013 (an S1P2 antagonist) blocked the S1P-induced action. RT-PCR revealed the presence of the S1P2 in ICC. Calphostin C (a protein kinase C inhibitor), NS-398 (a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor), PD 98059 (a p42/44 inhibitor), or SB 203580 (a p38 inhibitor) had no effects on S1P-induced action. However, c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor II suppressed S1P-induced action. External Ca2+-free solution or thapsigargin (a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum) suppressed action of S1P on ICC. In recording of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) concentration using fluo-4/AM S1P increased intensity of spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations in ICC. These results suggest that S1P can modulate pacemaker activity of ICC through S1P2 via regulation of external and internal Ca2+ and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.

Abstract: Summary
A long-standing question in plants and animals is how spatial patterns are maintained within stem cell niches despite ongoing cell divisions. Here we address how, during shoot meristem formation in Arabidopsis thaliana, the three apical cell layers acquire stem cell identity. Using a sensitized mutant screen, we identified miR394 as a mobile signal produced by the surface cell layer (the protoderm) that confers stem cell competence to the distal meristem by repressing the F box protein LEAF CURLING RESPONSIVENESS. This repression is required to potentiate signaling from underneath the stem cells by the transcription factor WUSCHEL, maintaining stem cell pluripotency. The interaction of two opposing signaling centers provides a mechanistic framework of how stem cells are localized at the tip of the meristem. Although the constituent cells change, the surface layer provides a stable point of reference in the self-organizing meristem.

Abstract: The required for Mla12 resistance (RAR1) protein is essential for the plant immune response. In rice, a model monocot species, the function of Oryza sativa RAR1 (OsRAR1) has been little explored. In our current study, we characterized the response of a rice osrar1 T-DNA insertion mutant to infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. osrar1 mutants displayed reduced resistance compared with wild type rice when inoculated with the normally virulent M. oryzae isolate PO6-6, indicating that OsRAR1 is required for an immune response to this pathogen. We also investigated the function of Os-RAR1 in the resistance mechanism mediated by the immune receptor genes Pib and Pi5 that encode nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. We inoculated progeny from Pib/osrar1 and Pi5/osrar1 heterozygous plants with the avirulent M. oryzae isolates, race 007 and PO6-6, respectively. We found that only Pib-mediated resistance was compromised by the osrar1 mutation and that the introduction of the OsRAR1 cDNA into Pib/osrar1 rescued Pib-mediated resistance. These results indicate that OsRAR1 is required for Pib-mediated resistance but not Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae.

Abstract: Background
Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have been successfully used to knock out endogenous genes in stem cell research. However, the deficiencies of current gene-based delivery systems may hamper the clinical application of these nucleases. A new delivery method that can improve the utility of these nucleases is needed.
Results
In this study, we utilized a cell-penetrating peptide-based system for ZFN and TALEN delivery. Functional TAT-ZFN and TAT-TALEN proteins were generated by fusing the cell-penetrating TAT peptide to ZFN and TALEN, respectively. However, TAT-ZFN was difficult to purify in quantities sufficient for analysis in cell culture. Purified TAT-TALEN was able to penetrate cells and disrupt the gene encoding endogenous human chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5, a co-receptor for HIV-1 entry into cells). Hypothermic treatment greatly enhanced the TAT-TALEN-mediated gene disruption efficiency. A 5% modification rate was observed in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) treated with TAT-TALEN as measured by the Surveyor assay.
Conclusions
TAT-TALEN protein-mediated gene disruption was applicable in hiPSCs and represents a promising technique for gene knockout in stem cells. This new technique may advance the clinical application of TALEN technology.

Abstract: I have used Ca2+- and pH-sensitive microelectrodes in and on large neurones in isolated ganglia of Helix aspersa to measure changes in intracellular Ca2+ (as VCa) and surface pH caused by caffeine (20mM) application, and compared these changes with those caused by iontophoretic injection of Ca2+. Mitochondrial uptake was blocked by pressure-injection of Ru360. In 8 experiments the mean increase in VCa in response to caffeine was 27.3±2.8mV (SEM) equivalent to a peak tenfold increase in ionised Ca2+. Iontophoretic injection of Ca2+ into the same 8 cells showed that the caffeine responses were equivalent to those caused by an average injection charge of 235±41nC. Surface pH changes produced by the PMCA pumping out Ca2+ released by caffeine averaged 0.025±.005 pH units (n=7), which was equivalent to surface pH changes induced by an average Ca2+ injection charge of 300±86nC. The average cell volume was 4.2nl. Assuming that the injection transport index was 0.48 as previously measured, these VCa and pH changes suggest that the total Ca2+ content released by caffeine was about 0.175mmol/l cell volume.

Abstract: Summary
The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) protein is an important epigenetic regulator required for the maintenance of gene activation during development. MLL chromosomal translocations produce novel fusion proteins that cause aggressive leukemias in humans. Individual MLL fusion proteins have distinct leukemic phenotypes even when expressed in the same cell type, but how this distinction is delineated on a molecular level is poorly understood. Here, we highlight a unique molecular mechanism whereby the RUNX1 gene is directly activated by MLL-AF4 and the RUNX1 protein interacts with the product of the reciprocal AF4-MLL translocation. These results support a mechanism of transformation whereby two oncogenic fusion proteins cooperate by activating a target gene and then modulating the function of its downstream product.

Abstract: Summary
Binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and cell-cycle progression. Using genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles, we describe binding of p53 also to regions located distantly from any known p53 target gene. Interestingly, many of these regions possess conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions. We demonstrate that these p53-bound enhancer regions (p53BERs) indeed contain enhancer activity and interact intrachromosomally with multiple neighboring genes to convey long-distance p53-dependent transcription regulation. Furthermore, p53BERs produce, in a p53-dependent manner, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest. Thus, our results ascribe transcription enhancement activity to p53 with the capacity to regulate multiple genes from a single genomic binding site. Moreover, eRNA production from p53BERs is required for efficient p53 transcription enhancement.

Abstract: Summary
Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) of tendons and aponeuroses is a deadly soft-tissue malignancy resembling melanoma, with a predilection for young adults. EWS-ATF1, the fusion product of a balanced chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 22 and 12, is considered the definitional feature of the tumor. Conditional expression of the EWS-ATF1 human cDNA in the mouse generates CCS-like tumors with 100% penetrance. Tumors, developed through varied means of initiating expression of the fusion oncogene, model human CCS morphologically, immunohistochemically, and by genome-wide expression profiling. We also demonstrate that although fusion oncogene expression in later stages of differentiation can transform mesenchymal progenitor cells and generate tumors resembling CCS generally, expression in cells retaining stem cell markers permits the full melanoma-related phenotype.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is regarded as a promising candidate for anticancer therapy due to its selective toxicity to cancer cells. Nevertheless, because of TRAIL resistance in some cancer cells, combined treatment with sensitizing agents is required to enhance the anticancer potential of TRAIL. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of apigenin-induced sensitization of HepG2 cells to TRAIL-induced cell death. Synergistic induction of apoptosis by combination was confirmed by examining the typical morphology changes of apoptosis, PARP-cleavage, and activation of effector caspases. Z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, inhibited the enhanced cell death by combined treatment of apigenin and TRAIL, demonstrating that a caspase-dependent pathway is involved in apigenin/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In addition, we found that apigenin/ TRAIL co-treatment up-regulates DR5 cell surface expression. The synergistic induction of cell death by the apigenin/TRAIL combination was significantly attenuated by DR5 blocking chimera antibody. Next, using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that ERK activation is involved in the induction of DR5 expression. Inhibition of ERK1/2 by U0126 significantly decreased the apigenin/TRAIL-induced DR5 expression and apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that apigenin can enhance the apoptotic effect of TRAIL via ERK-induced up-regulation of DR5.

Abstract: Summary
CD36 is a versatile receptor known to play a central role in the development of atherosclerosis, the pathogenesis of malaria, and the removal of apoptotic cells. Remarkably, the short cytosolically exposed regions of CD36 lack identifiable motifs, which has hampered elucidation of its mode of signaling. Using a combination of phosphoprotein isolation, mass spectrometry, superresolution imaging, and gene silencing, we have determined that the receptor induces ligand internalization through a heteromeric complex consisting of CD36, β1 and/or β2 integrins, and the tetraspanins CD9 and/or CD81. This receptor complex serves to link CD36 to the adaptor FcRγ, which bears an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif. By coupling to FcRγ, CD36 is able to engage Src-family kinases and Syk, which in turn drives the internalization of CD36 and its bound ligands.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing prevents deleterious effects of transposon activity and controls the expression of protein-coding genes. It involves long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In Arabidopsis thaliana, some of those lncRNAs are produced by a specialized RNA Polymerase V (Pol V). The mechanism by which lncRNAs affect chromatin structure and mRNA production remains mostly unknown. Here we identify the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling complex as a component of the RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing pathway. We found that SWI3B, an essential subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, physically interacts with a lncRNA-binding protein, IDN2. SWI/SNF subunits contribute to lncRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing. Moreover, Pol V mediates stabilization of nucleosomes on silenced regions. We propose that Pol V-produced lncRNAs mediate transcriptional silencing by guiding the SWI/SNF complex and establishing positioned nucleosomes on specific genomic loci. We further propose that guiding ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes may be a more general function of lncRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Histone methyltransferases (HMTases), as chromatin modifiers, regulate the transcriptomic landscape in normal development as well in diseases such as cancer. Here, we molecularly order two HMTases, EZH2 and MMSET, that have established genetic links to oncogenesis. EZH2, which mediates histone H3K27 trimethylation and is associated with gene silencing, was shown to be coordinately expressed and function upstream of MMSET, which mediates H3K36 dimethylation and is associated with active transcription. We found that the EZH2-MMSET HMTase axis is coordinated by a microRNA network and that the oncogenic functions of EZH2 require MMSET activity. Together, these results suggest that the EZH2-MMSET HMTase axis coordinately functions as a master regulator of transcriptional repression, activation, and oncogenesis and may represent an attractive therapeutic target in cancer.

Conserved Bacterial RNase YbeY Plays Key Roles in 70S Ribosome Quality Control and 16S rRNA Maturation,

Abstract: Summary
Quality control of ribosomes is critical for cellular function since protein mistranslation leads to severe physiological consequences. We report evidence of a previously unrecognized ribosome quality control system in bacteria that operates at the level of 70S to remove defective ribosomes. YbeY, a previously unidentified endoribonuclease, and the exonuclease RNase R act together by a process mediated specifically by the 30S ribosomal subunit, to degrade defective 70S ribosomes but not properly matured 70S ribosomes or individual subunits. Furthermore, there is essentially no fully matured 16S rRNA in a ΔybeY mutant at 45°C, making YbeY the only endoribonuclease to be implicated in the critically important processing of the 16S rRNA 3′ terminus. These key roles in ribosome quality control and maturation indicate why YbeY is a member of the minimal bacterial gene set and suggest that it could be a potential target for antibacterial drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in WNK kinases cause the human hypertensive disease pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), but the regulatory mechanisms of the WNK kinases are not well understood. Mutations in kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) and Cullin3 were also recently identified as causing PHAII. Therefore, new insights into the mechanisms of human hypertension can be gained by determining how these components interact and how they are involved in the pathogenesis of PHAII. Here, we found that KLHL3 interacted with Cullin3 and WNK4, induced WNK4 ubiquitination, and reduced the WNK4 protein level. The reduced interaction of KLHL3 and WNK4 by PHAII-causing mutations in either protein reduced the ubiquitination of WNK4, resulting in an increased level of WNK4 protein. Transgenic mice overexpressing WNK4 showed PHAII phenotypes, and WNK4 protein was indeed increased in Wnk4D561A/+ PHAII model mice. Thus, WNK4 is a target for KLHL3-mediated ubiquitination, and the impaired ubiquitination of WNK4 is a common mechanism of human hereditary hypertension.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that sustain stem cells are fundamental to tissue maintenance. Here, we identify “cell islands” (CIs) as a niche for putative germ and somatic stem cells in Botryllus schlosseri, a colonial chordate that undergoes weekly cycles of death and regeneration. Cells within CIs express markers associated with germ and somatic stem cells and gene products that implicate CIs as signaling centers for stem cells. Transplantation of CIs induced long-term germline and somatic chimerism, demonstrating self-renewal and pluripotency of CI cells. Cell labeling and in vivo time-lapse imaging of CI cells reveal waves of migrations from degrading CIs into developing buds, contributing to soma and germline development. Knockdown of cadherin, which is highly expressed within CIs, elicited the migration of CI cells to circulation. Piwi knockdown resulted in regeneration arrest. We suggest that repeated trafficking of stem cells allows them to escape constraints imposed by the niche, enabling self-preservation throughout life.
