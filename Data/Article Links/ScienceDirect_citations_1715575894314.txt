Abstract: Summary
The respiratory epithelium consists of multiple, functionally distinct cell types and is maintained by regionally specific progenitor populations that repair the epithelium following injury. Several in vitro methods exist for studying lung epithelial repair using primary murine lung cells, but isolation methods are hampered by a lack of surface markers distinguishing epithelial progenitors along the respiratory epithelium. Here, we developed a 3D printed lobe divider (3DLD) to aid in simultaneous isolation of proximal versus distal lung epithelial progenitors from individual mice that give rise to differentiated epithelia in multiple in vitro assays. In contrast to 3DLD-isolated distal progenitor cells, commonly used manual tracheal ligation methods followed by lobe removal resulted in co-isolation of rare proximal cells with distal cells, which altered the transcriptional landscape and size distribution of distal organoids. The 3DLD aids in reproducible isolation of distal versus proximal progenitor populations and minimizes the potential for contaminating populations to confound in vitro assays.

Abstract: Summary
GM-CSF promotes myelopoiesis and inflammation, and GM-CSF blockade is being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. Alveolar GM-CSF is, however, required for monocytes to differentiate into alveolar macrophages (AMs) that control alveolar homeostasis. By mapping cross-species AM development to clinical lung samples, we discovered that COVID-19 is marked by defective GM-CSF-dependent AM instruction and accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages. In a multi-center, open-label RCT in 81 non-ventilated COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, we found that inhalation of rhu-GM-CSF did not improve mean oxygenation parameters compared with standard treatment. However, more patients on GM-CSF had a clinical response, and GM-CSF inhalation induced higher numbers of virus-specific CD8 effector lymphocytes and class-switched B cells, without exacerbating systemic hyperinflammation. This translational proof-of-concept study provides a rationale for further testing of inhaled GM-CSF as a non-invasive treatment to improve alveolar gas exchange and simultaneously boost antiviral immunity in COVID-19. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04326920) and EudraCT (2020-001254-22).

Abstract: Summary
Direct in vivo investigation of human placenta trophoblast’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is challenging. Here we report that human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) and their derivatives are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which reveals heterogeneity in hTSC cultures. Early syncytiotrophoblasts (eSTBs) generated from hTSCs have enriched transcriptomic features of peri-implantation trophoblasts, express high levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and are productively infected by SARS-CoV-2 and its Delta and Omicron variants to produce virions. Antiviral drugs suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in eSTBs and antagonize the virus-induced blockage of STB maturation. Although less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, trophoblast organoids originating from hTSCs show detectable viral replication reminiscent of the uncommon placental infection. These findings implicate possible risk of COVID-19 infection in peri-implantation embryos, which may go unnoticed. Stem cell-derived human trophoblasts such as eSTBs can potentially provide unlimited amounts of normal and genome-edited cells and facilitate coronavirus research and antiviral discovery.

Abstract: Patients with end-stage renal disease often need dialysis to maintain their lives because of donor organ shortage. The creation of a transplantable graft to permanently replace kidney function would overcome the organ shortage problem and the morbidity associated with immunosuppression. In the present study, we decellularized rat kidneys by the perfusion of detergent, yielding acellular scaffolds with the vascular, uretic, as well as cortical and medullary architecture. To regenerate the functional organ, we seeded tubular epithelial cells and mouse kidney progenitor cells from the ureter together with endothelial cells and mouse kidney progenitor cells from the renal artery. The renal constructs from seeded cells were cultured in a whole-organ bioreactor. After 3 months of organ culture, the seeded cells formed renal tubules, grew in the glomeruli, and some mouse kidney progenitor cells were also scattered in the interstitium. We tested the function of the bioengineered kidney with standardized perfusate in vitro. The bioengineered kidney not only produced urine but also reabsorbed albumin, glucose, and calcium. We conclude that seeded cell-based bioengineering of kidneys with physiological secreting and reabsorbing properties is possible and holds therapeutic promise.

Abstract: Summary
Effective delivery of therapeutics to the brain is challenging. Molecular shuttles use receptors expressed on brain endothelial cells to deliver therapeutics. Antibodies targeting transferrin receptor (TfR) have been widely developed as molecular shuttles. However, the TfR-based approach raises concerns about safety and developmental burden. Here, we report insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) as an ideal target for the molecular shuttle. We also describe Grabody B, an antibody against IGF1R, as a molecular shuttle. Grabody B has broad cross-species reactivity and does not interfere with IGF1R-mediated signaling. We demonstrate that administration of Grabody B-fused anti-alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) antibody induces better improvement in neuropathology and behavior in a Parkinson’s disease animal model than the therapeutic antibody alone due to its superior serum pharmacokinetics and enhanced brain exposure. The results indicate that IGF1R is an ideal shuttle target and Grabody B is a safe and efficient molecular shuttle.

Abstract: Summary
Mediator kinases (CDK8/19) are transcriptional regulators broadly implicated in cancer. Despite their central role in fine-tuning gene-expression programs, we find complete loss of CDK8/19 is tolerated in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Using orthogonal functional genomic and pharmacological screens, we identify BET protein inhibition as a distinct vulnerability in CDK8/19-depleted cells. Combined CDK8/19 and BET inhibition led to synergistic growth retardation in human and mouse models of CRC. Strikingly, depletion of CDK8/19 in these cells led to global repression of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter occupancy and transcription. Concurrently, loss of Mediator kinase led to a profound increase in MED12 and BRD4 co-occupancy at enhancer elements and increased dependence on BET proteins for the transcriptional output of cell-essential genes. In total, this work demonstrates a synthetic lethal interaction between Mediator kinase and BET proteins and exposes a therapeutic vulnerability that can be targeted using combination therapies.

Abstract: Summary
We profiled the liver transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome in 347 individuals from 58 isogenic strains of the BXD mouse population across age (7 to 24 months) and diet (low or high fat) to link molecular variations to metabolic traits. Several hundred genes are affected by diet and/or age at the transcript and protein levels. Orthologs of two aging-associated genes, St7 and Ctsd, were knocked down in C. elegans, reducing longevity in wild-type and mutant long-lived strains. The multiomics data were analyzed as segregating gene networks according to each independent variable, providing causal insight into dietary and aging effects. Candidates were cross-examined in an independent diversity outbred mouse liver dataset segregating for similar diets, with ∼80%–90% of diet-related candidate genes found in common across datasets. Together, we have developed a large multiomics resource for multivariate analysis of complex traits and demonstrate a methodology for moving from observational associations to causal connections.

Abstract: Summary
Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) improves outcomes in resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), but acquired resistance precludes long-term efficacy. Here, we delineate these resistance mechanisms. RNA sequencing on matched patient samples obtained pre-and post-neoadjuvant treatment reveal that oxidative phosphorylation was the most upregulated of all biological programs following nCRT. Analysis of patient-derived models confirms that mitochondrial content and oxygen consumption strongly increase in response to nCRT and that ionizing radiation is the causative agent. Bioinformatics identifies estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) as the transcription factor responsible for reprogramming, and overexpression and silencing of ESRRA functionally confirm that its downstream metabolic rewiring contributes to resistance. Pharmacological inhibition of ESRRA successfully sensitizes EAC organoids and patient-derived xenografts to radiation. In conclusion, we report a profound metabolic rewiring following chemoradiation and demonstrate that its inhibition resensitizes EAC cells to radiation. These findings hold broader relevance for other cancer types treated with radiation as well.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) initially protects broken DNA ends but then promotes their processing during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Before ligation by NHEJ, DNA hairpin ends generated during V(D)J recombination must be opened by the Artemis nuclease, together with autophosphorylated DNA-PK. Structures of DNA-PK bound to DNA before and after phosphorylation, and in complex with Artemis and a DNA hairpin, reveal an essential functional switch. When bound to open DNA ends in its protection mode, DNA-PK is inhibited for cis-autophosphorylation of the so-called ABCDE cluster but activated for phosphorylation of other targets. In contrast, DNA hairpin ends promote cis-autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of four Thr residues in ABCDE leads to gross structural rearrangement of DNA-PK, widening the DNA binding groove for Artemis recruitment and hairpin cleavage. Meanwhile, Artemis locks DNA-PK into the kinase-inactive state. Kinase activity and autophosphorylation of DNA-PK are regulated by different DNA ends, feeding forward to coordinate NHEJ events.

Abstract: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a clonal malignant disease. Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1-R123 (IDH1-R132 H) is related to T-ALL progression. This study explored the role of IDH1-R132H in T-ALL. Molt-4 cells with IDH1-R132H mutation were constructed by retroviral transfection of IDH1-R132H and T-ALL xenotransplantation mouse model was established by injection of Molt-4 cells through the tail vein. Infiltration of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and the percentage of CD45-positive T-ALL cells in them were detected. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were evaluated after the intervention of Notch1, PTEN, or PI3K expression. The leukocyte number was increased, the spleen was enlarged, infiltration in bone marrow, spleen, and liver tissue was worsened and the percentage of hCD45-positive T-ALL cells was increased by IDH1-R132H mutation, which promoted T-ALL deterioration. IDH1-R132H mutation promoted proliferation, invasion, and inhibited apoptosis of T-ALL cells, which were reversed by inhibition of Notch1. IDH1-R132H mutation upregulated HES1 expression and downregulated PTEN expression by activating the Notch1 pathway, while inhibition of Notch1 reversed these changes. PTEN inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway activation. PTEN overexpression reversed IDH1-R132H mutation effect on promoting malignant behaviors of T-ALL cells. IDH1-R132H mutation inhibited PTEN expression by activating the Notch1/HES1 pathway, activated the PI3K/AKT pathway, thus promoting malignant behaviors of T-ALL cells.

Abstract: Endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) represent the most suitable cellular substrate to induce revascularization of ischemic tissues. Recently, optical excitation of the light-sensitive conjugated polymer, regioregular Poly (3-hexyl-thiophene), rr-P3HT, was found to stimulate ECFC proliferation and tube formation by activating the non-selective cation channel, Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Herein, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach, ranging from intracellular Ca2+ imaging to pharmacological manipulation and genetic suppression of TRPV1 expression, to investigate the effects of photoexcitation on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in circulating ECFCs plated on rr-P3HT thin films. Polymer-mediated optical excitation induced a long-lasting increase in [Ca2+]i that could display an oscillatory pattern at shorter light stimuli. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation revealed that the Ca2+ response to light was triggered by extracellular Ca2+ entry through TRPV1, whose activation required the production of reactive oxygen species at the interface between rr-P3HT and the cell membrane. Light-induced TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ entry was able to evoke intracellular Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum through inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, followed by store-operated Ca2+ entry on the plasma membrane. These data show that TRPV1 may serve as a decoder at the interface between rr-P3HT thin films and ECFCs to translate optical excitation in pro-angiogenic Ca2+ signals.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is associated with the highest morbidity rate among gynecological cancers. Radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of cervical cancer. However, a considerable number of patients are radiation resistant, leading to a poor prognosis. Matrix stiffness is related to the occurrence, development, and chemoresistance of solid tumors. The association between matrix stiffness and radiosensitivity in cervical cancer cells remains unknown. Here, we sought to determine the effect of matrix stiffness on the phenotype and radiosensitivity of cervical cancer cells. Cervical squamous carcinoma SiHa cells were grown on substrates of different stiffnesses (0.5, 5, and 25 kPa). Cell morphology, proliferation, and radiosensitivity were examined. Cells grown on hard substrates displayed stronger proliferative activity, larger size, and higher differentiation degree, which was reflected in a more mature skeleton assembly, more abundant pseudopodia formation, and smaller nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, SiHa cells exhibited stiffness-dependent resistance to radiation, possibly via altered apoptosis-related protein expression. Our findings demonstrate that matrix stiffness affects the morphology, proliferation, and radiosensitivity of SiHa cells. Tissue stiffness may be an indicator of the sensitivity of a patient to radiotherapy. Thus, the data provide insights into the diagnosis of cervical cancer and the design of future radiotherapies.

Abstract: CD38 is a single-pass transmembrane enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of two nucleotide second messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) from NADP. The former mediates the mobilization of the endoplasmic Ca2+-stores in response to a wide range of stimuli, while NAADP targets the endo-lysosomal stores. CD38 not only possesses multiple enzymatic activities, it also exists in two opposite membrane orientations. Type III CD38 has the catalytic domain facing the cytosol and is responsible for producing cellular cADPR. The type II CD38 has an opposite orientation and is serving as a surface receptor mediating extracellular functions such as cell adhesion and lymphocyte activation. Its ecto-NADase activity also contributes to the recycling of external NAD released by apoptosis. Endocytosis can deliver surface type II CD38 to endo-lysosomes, which acidic environment favors the production of NAADP. This article reviews the rationale and evidence that have led to CD38 as a paradigm for membrane topology defining distinct functions of proteins. Also described is the recent discovery of a hitherto unknown cADPR-synthesizing enzyme, SARM1, ushering in a new frontier in cADPR-mediated Ca2+-signaling.

Abstract: Animal cells are amazing examples of decentralized systems: By interchanging information about their position and internal state, cells coordinate their behavior and organize themselves in time and space. Examples of this behavior are the development of an embryo or of an organoid. In this work we have asked which are the “rules of intercellular relationship” that allow the organization of an abstract cell collective into structures similar to simple metazoans, without being specific about the (molecular, cellular or physical) nature of the processes involved. To do so, we have used a computational modeling approach following a modified version of the “Swarmalator” concept introduced by O'Keeffe, Hong and Strogatz (2017): a collection of interacting particles (“swarmalators”), each of which defined by a position in space and an internal state (a phase). The key feature is that swarmalators are coupled, so that their position and internal state are both affected by the position and state of all other swarmalators. This model can be easily analogized to biological systems, with “cells” being the swarmalators, and their phase the cell's internal state or “cell type”. With this model we explore the conditions (represented by the coupling parameters) that would allow the organization of a multicellular “bioswarmer” and its dynamics along a sort of life cycle. Originally developed in 2D, we implement the model in 3D as well. We describe how changing the strength of intercellular communication can alter the structure and differentiation state of the bioswarmer, how internal polarization can arise and trigger collective directed migration, or how partly erasing the cellular memory of cell state is critical to allow bioswarmers to transit through different states. In addition, we show that the size of a multicellular ensemble might control the differentiation of its constituent cells without changing its rules of relationship.

Abstract: Summary
Perceptual decision-making tasks are essential to many fields of neuroscience. Current protocols generally reward deprived animals with water. However, balancing animals’ deprivation level with their well-being is challenging, and trial number is limited by satiation. Here, we present electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) as an alternative that avoids deprivation while yielding stable motivation for thousands of trials. Using licking or lever press as a report, MFB animals learnt auditory discrimination tasks at similar speed to water-deprived mice. Moreover, they more reliably reached higher accuracy in harder tasks, performing up to 4,500 trials per session without loss of motivation. MFB stimulation did not impact the underlying sensory behavior since psychometric parameters and response times are preserved. MFB mice lacked signs of metabolic or behavioral stress compared with water-deprived mice. Overall, MFB stimulation is a highly promising tool for task learning because it enhances task performance while avoiding deprivation.

Abstract: Summary
Allosteric coupling between the DNA binding site to the NAD+-binding pocket drives PARP-1 activation. This allosteric communication occurs in the reverse direction such that NAD+ mimetics can enhance PARP-1’s affinity for DNA, referred to as type I inhibition. The cellular effects of type I inhibition are unknown, largely because of the lack of potent, membrane-permeable type I inhibitors. Here we identify the phthalazinone inhibitor AZ0108 as a type I inhibitor. Unlike the structurally related inhibitor olaparib, AZ0108 induces replication stress in tumorigenic cells. Synthesis of analogs of AZ0108 revealed features of AZ0108 that are required for type I inhibition. One analog, Pip6, showed similar type I inhibition of PARP-1 but was ∼90-fold more cytotoxic than AZ0108. Washout experiments suggest that the enhanced cytotoxicity of Pip6 compared with AZ0108 is due to prolonged target residence time on PARP-1. Pip6 represents a new class of PARP-1 inhibitors that may have unique anticancer properties.

Abstract: Summary
Cells employ intracellular signaling pathways to sense and respond to changes in their external environment. In recent years, live-cell biosensors have revealed complex pulsatile dynamics in many pathways, but studies of these signaling dynamics are limited by the necessity of live-cell imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we describe an approach to infer pulsatile signaling dynamics from a single measurement in fixed cells using a pulse-detecting gene circuit. We computationally screened for circuits with the capability to selectively detect signaling pulses, revealing an incoherent feedforward topology that robustly performs this computation. We implemented the motif experimentally for the Erk signaling pathway using a single engineered transcription factor and fluorescent protein reporter. Our “recorder of Erk activity dynamics” (READer) responds sensitively to spontaneous and stimulus-driven Erk pulses. READer circuits open the door to permanently labeling transient, dynamic cell populations to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings and biological consequences of signaling dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The concept of a perivascular niche has been proposed for neural stem cells (NSCs). This study examined endothelial colony-forming cell (ECFC)-secreted proteins as potential niche factors for NSCs. Intraventricle infusion with ECFC-secreted proteins increased the number of NSCs. ECFC-secreted proteins were more effective in promoting NSC self-renewal than marrow stromal cell (MSC)-secreted proteins. Differential proteomics analysis of MSC-secreted and ECFC-secreted proteins was performed, which revealed chitinase-like protein 3 (CHIL3; also called ECF-L or Ym1) as a candidate niche factor for NSCs. Experiments with recombinant CHIL3, small interfering RNA, and neutralizing antibodies demonstrated that CHIL3 stimulated NSC self-renewal with neurogenic propensity. CHIL3 was endogenously expressed in the neurogenic niche of the brain and retina as well as in the injured brain and retina. Transcriptome and phosphoproteome analyses revealed that CHIL3 activated various genes and proteins associated with NSC maintenance or neurogenesis. Thus, CHIL3 is a novel niche factor for NSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a delayed-onset, COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory illness characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigenemia, cytokine storm, and immune dysregulation. In severe COVID-19, neutrophil activation is central to hyperinflammatory complications, yet the role of neutrophils in MIS-C is undefined. Here, we collect blood from 152 children: 31 cases of MIS-C, 43 cases of acute pediatric COVID-19, and 78 pediatric controls. We find that MIS-C neutrophils display a granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (G-MDSC) signature with highly altered metabolism that is distinct from the neutrophil interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) response we observe in pediatric COVID-19. Moreover, we observe extensive spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in MIS-C, and we identify neutrophil activation and degranulation signatures. Mechanistically, we determine that SARS-CoV-2 immune complexes are sufficient to trigger NETosis. Our findings suggest that hyperinflammatory presentation during MIS-C could be mechanistically linked to persistent SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia, driven by uncontrolled neutrophil activation and NET release in the vasculature.

Abstract: Summary
Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is a major regulator of brown and beige adipocyte energy expenditure and metabolic homeostasis. However, the widely employed UCP1 loss-of-function model has recently been shown to have a severe deficiency in the entire electron transport chain of thermogenic fat. As such, the role of UCP1 in metabolic regulation in vivo remains unclear. We recently identified cysteine-253 as a regulatory site on UCP1 that elevates protein activity upon covalent modification. Here, we examine the physiological importance of this site through the generation of a UCP1 cysteine-253-null (UCP1 C253A) mouse, a precise genetic model for selective disruption of UCP1 in vivo. UCP1 C253A mice exhibit significantly compromised thermogenic responses in both males and females but display no measurable effect on fat accumulation in an obesogenic environment. Unexpectedly, we find that a lack of C253 results in adipose tissue redox stress, which drives substantial immune cell infiltration and systemic inflammatory pathology in adipose tissues and liver of male, but not female, mice. Elevation of systemic estrogen reverses this male-specific pathology, providing a basis for protection from inflammation due to loss of UCP1 C253 in females. Together, our results establish the UCP1 C253 activation site as a regulator of acute thermogenesis and sex-dependent tissue inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) regularly and irreversibly show the erosion of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) by long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) XIST silencing, causing challenges in various applications of female hPSCs. Here, we report reliable methods to reactivate XIST with monoallelic expression in female hPSCs. Surprisingly, we find that the editing of XIST regulatory regions by Cas9-mediated non-homologous end joining is sufficient for the reactivation of XIST by endogenous systems. Proliferated hPSCs with XIST reactivation show XCI from an eroded X chromosome, suggesting that hPSCs with normal dosage compensation might lead to a growth advantage. Furthermore, the use of targeting vectors, including the XIST regulatory region sequences and selection cassette, enables XIST reactivation in hPSCs with high efficiency. XIST-reactivated hPSCs can show the restoration of differentiation potential. Thus, our findings demonstrate that XIST re-expression is a beneficial method to maximize the use of female hPSCs in various applications, such as proper disease modeling.

Abstract: Summary
Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary form of colon cancer, resulting from a germline mutation in a DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene. Loss of MMR in cells establishes a mutator phenotype, which may underlie its link to cancer. Acquired downstream mutations that provide the cell a selective advantage would contribute to tumorigenesis. It is unclear, however, whether loss of MMR has other consequences that would directly result in a selective advantage. We found that knockout of the MMR gene MSH2 results in an immediate survival advantage in human stem cells grown under standard cell culture conditions. This advantage results, in part, from an MMR-dependent response to oxidative stress. We also found that loss of MMR gives rise to enhanced formation and growth of human colonic organoids. These results suggest that loss of MMR may affect cells in ways beyond just increasing mutation frequency that could influence tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Researching the murine epigenome in disease models has been hampered by the lack of appropriate and cost-effective DNA methylation arrays. Here we perform a comprehensive, comparative analysis between the Mouse Methylation BeadChip (MMB) and reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) in two murine models of colorectal carcinogenesis. We evaluate the coverage, variability, and ability to identify differential DNA methylation of RRBS and MMB. We show that MMB is an effective tool for profiling the murine methylome that performs comparably with RRBS, identifying similar differentially methylated pathways. Although choice of technology is experiment dependent and will be predicated on the underlying biology being probed, these analyses provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Abstract: Summary
The epitranscriptome has emerged as a new fundamental layer of control of gene expression. Nevertheless, the determination of the transcriptome-wide occupancy and function of RNA modifications remains challenging. Here we have developed Rho-seq, an integrated pipeline detecting a range of modifications through differential modification-dependent rhodamine labeling. Using Rho-seq, we confirm that the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine (D) by the Dus reductase enzymes targets tRNAs in E. coli and fission yeast. We find that the D modification is also present on fission yeast mRNAs, particularly those encoding cytoskeleton-related proteins, which is supported by large-scale proteome analyses and ribosome profiling. We show that the α-tubulin encoding mRNA nda2 undergoes Dus3-dependent dihydrouridylation, which affects its translation. The absence of the modification on nda2 mRNA strongly impacts meiotic chromosome segregation, resulting in low gamete viability. Applying Rho-seq to human cells revealed that tubulin mRNA dihydrouridylation is evolutionarily conserved.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in optical technology have revolutionized studies of brain function in freely behaving mice. Here, we describe an optical imaging and stimulation device for use in primates that easily attaches to an intracranial chamber. It consists of affordable commercially available or 3D-printed components: a monochromatic camera, a small standard lens, a wireless μLED stimulator powered by an induction coil, and an LED array for illumination. We show that the intrinsic imaging performance of this device is comparable to a standard benchtop system in revealing the functional organization of the visual cortex for awake macaques in a primate chair or under anesthesia. Imaging revealed neural modulatory effects of wireless focal optogenetic stimulation aimed at identified functional domains. With a 1 to 2 cm field of view, 100× larger than previously used in primates without head restraint, our device permits widefield optical imaging and optogenetic stimulation for ethological studies in primates.

Abstract: Summary
The Lassa virus is endemic in parts of West Africa, and it causes hemorrhagic fever with high mortality. The development of a recombinant protein vaccine has been hampered by the instability of soluble Lassa virus glycoprotein complex (GPC) trimers, which disassemble into monomeric subunits after expression. Here, we use two-component protein nanoparticles consisting of trimeric and pentameric subunits to stabilize GPC in a trimeric conformation. These GPC nanoparticles present twenty prefusion GPC trimers on the surface of an icosahedral particle. Cryo-EM studies of GPC nanoparticles demonstrated a well-ordered structure and yielded a high-resolution structure of an unliganded GPC. These nanoparticles induced potent humoral immune responses in rabbits and protective immunity against the lethal Lassa virus challenge in guinea pigs. Additionally, we isolated a neutralizing antibody that mapped to the putative receptor-binding site, revealing a previously undefined site of vulnerability. Collectively, these findings offer potential approaches to vaccine and therapeutic design for the Lassa virus.

Abstract: Summary
Other than genetically engineered mice, few reliable platforms are available for the study of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence. Here we present a platform to analyze HSC cell cycle quiescence by combining culture conditions that maintain quiescence with a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system optimized for HSCs. We demonstrate that preculture of HSCs enhances editing efficiency by facilitating nuclear transport of ribonucleoprotein complexes. For post-editing culture, mouse and human HSCs edited based on non-homologous end joining and cultured under low-cytokine, low-oxygen, and high-albumin conditions retain their phenotypes and quiescence better than those cultured under the proliferative conditions. Using this approach, HSCs regain quiescence even after editing by homology-directed repair. Our results show that low-cytokine culture conditions for gene-edited HSCs are a useful approach for investigating HSC quiescence ex vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous recombination DNA-repair deficiency (HRD) is becoming a well-recognized marker of platinum salt and polyADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor chemotherapies in ovarian and breast cancers. While large-scale screening for HRD using genomic markers is logistically and economically challenging, stained tissue slides are routinely acquired in clinical practice. With the objectives of providing a robust deep-learning method for HRD prediction from tissue slides and identifying related morphological phenotypes, we first show that digital pathology workflows are sensitive to potential biases in the training set, then we propose a method to overcome the influence of these biases, and we develop an interpretation method capable of identifying complex phenotypes. Application to our carefully curated in-house dataset allows us to predict HRD with high accuracy (area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve 0.86) and to identify morphological phenotypes related to HRD. In particular, the presence of laminated fibrosis and clear tumor cells associated with HRD open new hypotheses regarding its phenotypic impact.

Abstract: Summary
We develop a closed-form Haseman-Elston estimator for genetic and environmental correlation coefficients between complex phenotypes, which we term HEc, that is as precise as GCTA yet ∼20× faster. We estimate genetic and environmental correlations between over 7,000 phenotype pairs in subgroups from the Trans-Omics in Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. We demonstrate substantial differences in both heritabilities and genetic correlations for multiple phenotypes and phenotype pairs between individuals of self-reported Black, Hispanic/Latino, and White backgrounds. We similarly observe differences in many of the genetic and environmental correlations between genders. To estimate the contribution of genetics to the observed phenotypic correlation, we introduce “fractional genetic correlation” as the fraction of phenotypic correlation explained by genetics. Finally, we quantify the enrichment of correlations between phenotypic domains, each of which is comprised of multiple phenotypes. Altogether, we demonstrate that the observed correlations between complex human phenotypes depend on the genetic background of the individuals, their gender, and their environment.

Abstract: Summary
In the mammalian embryo, a formative pluripotent phase is proposed to exist at the early post-implantation period, during the transition from the pre-implantation naive—to the post-implantation primed—epiblast. By recapitulating a laminin component of the extracellular matrix niche during embryonic formative transition, and defined culture conditions, we generated cultures highly enriched for self-renewing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), exhibiting properties of early post-implantation epiblast cells. These hPSCs display post-implantation-epiblast gene expression profiles. FGF and TGF-β signaling maintain their self-renewal for multiple passages. They have inactive canonical Wnt signaling, do not express primitive streak markers, and are competent to initiate differentiation toward germline and somatic fates. hPSCs exhibiting early post-implantation epiblast properties may shed light on human embryonic PSCs development and may serve for initiating somatic and germ cell specification.

Abstract: Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) localize to airway motile cilia and initiate innate immune responses in retaliation to bacterial quorum sensing molecules. Activation of cilia T2Rs leads to calcium-driven NO production that increases cilia beating and directly kills bacteria. Several diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, are characterized by loss of motile cilia and/or squamous metaplasia. To understand T2R function within the altered landscape of airway disease, we studied T2Rs in non-ciliated airway cell lines and primary cells. Several T2Rs localize to the nucleus in de-differentiated cells that typically localize to cilia in differentiated cells. As cilia and nuclear import utilize shared proteins, some T2Rs may target to the nucleus in the absence of motile cilia. T2R agonists selectively elevated nuclear and mitochondrial calcium through a G-protein-coupled receptor phospholipase C mechanism. Additionally, T2R agonists decreased nuclear cAMP, increased nitric oxide, and increased cGMP, consistent with T2R signaling. Furthermore, exposure to T2R agonists led to nuclear calcium-induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation. T2R agonists induced apoptosis in primary bronchial and nasal cells differentiated at air-liquid interface but then induced to a squamous phenotype by apical submersion. Air-exposed well-differentiated cells did not die. This may be a last-resort defense against bacterial infection. However, it may also increase susceptibility of de-differentiated or remodeled epithelia to damage by bacterial metabolites. Moreover, the T2R-activated apoptosis pathway occurs in airway cancer cells. T2Rs may thus contribute to microbiome-tumor cell crosstalk in airway cancers. Targeting T2Rs may be useful for activating cancer cell apoptosis while sparing surrounding tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin resistance is a pathological state often associated with obesity, representing a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Limited mechanism-based strategies exist to alleviate insulin resistance. Here, using single-cell transcriptomics, we identify a small, critically important, but previously unexamined cell population, p21Cip1 highly expressing (p21high) cells, which accumulate in adipose tissue with obesity. By leveraging a p21-Cre mouse model, we demonstrate that intermittent clearance of p21high cells can both prevent and alleviate insulin resistance in obese mice. Exclusive inactivation of the NF-κB pathway within p21high cells, without killing them, attenuates insulin resistance. Moreover, fat transplantation experiments establish that p21high cells within fat are sufficient to cause insulin resistance in vivo. Importantly, a senolytic cocktail, dasatinib plus quercetin, eliminates p21high cells in human fat ex vivo and mitigates insulin resistance following xenotransplantation into immuno-deficient mice. Our findings lay the foundation for pursuing the targeting of p21high cells as a new therapy to alleviate insulin resistance.

The gut microbiome is essential for human health. Mouse microbiota models, including gnotobiotic mice, are the most prominent tools to elucidate the functions of gut bacteria. Here, we propose a targeted-bacterium-depleted (TBD) model using lytic bacteriophage to selectively deplete gut bacterium of healthy or otherwise defined mice. These phage-treated animals should have a near-complete spectrum of gut bacteria except for the depleted bacterium. To prove the concept, we employed Escherichia coli-specific phage T7 to repress E. coli in the healthy mice. Our results showed that the E. coli-depleted mice exhibited bravery-like behaviors, correlated to the presence of E. coli rather than the equilibrium among gut bacteria. Thus, we demonstrate that the TBD model is a powerful tool to elucidate the function of a specific bacterial species within a near-intact gut microbiota environment and complements gnotobiotic mice models.

Abstract: Summary
Despite development of protocols to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), those used to produce sensory neurons remain difficult to replicate and result in heterogenous populations. There is a growing clinical burden of chronic pain conditions, highlighting the need for relevant human cellular models. This study presents a hybrid differentiation method to produce nociceptive sensory neurons from hPSCs. Lines harboring an inducible NEUROG2 construct were patterned toward precursors with small molecules followed by NEUROG2 overexpression. Neurons expressed key markers, including BRN3A and ISL1, with single-cell RNA sequencing, revealing populations of nociceptors expressing SCN9A and TRP channels. Physiological profiling with multi-electrode arrays revealed that neurons responded to noxious stimuli, including capsaicin. Finally, we modeled pain-like states to identify genes and pathways involved in pain transduction. This study presents an optimized method to efficiently produce nociceptive sensory neurons and provides a tool to aid development of chronic pain research.

Abstract: Summary
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension characterized by the preferential remodeling of the pulmonary venules. Hereditary PVOD is caused by biallelic variants of the EIF2AK4 gene. Three PVOD patients who carried the compound heterozygous variants of EIF2AK4 and two healthy controls were recruited and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The EIF2AK4 c.2965C>T variant (PVOD#1), c.3460A>T variant (PVOD#2), and c.4832_4833insAAAG variant (PVOD#3) were corrected by CRISPR-Cas9 in PVOD-iPSCs to generate isogenic controls and gene-corrected-iPSCs (GC-iPSCs). PVOD-iPSC-endothelial cells (ECs) exhibited a decrease in GCN2 protein and mRNA expression when compared with control and GC-ECs. PVOD-ECs exhibited an abnormal EC phenotype featured by excessive proliferation and angiogenesis. The abnormal phenotype of PVOD-ECs was normalized by protein kinase B inhibitors AZD5363 and MK2206. These findings help elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of PVOD in humans and to identify promising therapeutic drugs for treating the disease.

Abstract: Summary
We apply a computational model, global multi-mutant analysis (GMMA), to inform on effects of most amino acid substitutions from a randomly mutated gene library. Using a high mutation frequency, the method can determine mutations that increase the stability of even very stable proteins for which conventional selection systems have reached their limit. As a demonstration of this, we screened a mutant library of a highly stable and computationally redesigned model protein using an in vivo genetic sensor for folding and assigned a stability effect to 374 of 912 possible single amino acid substitutions. Combining the top 9 substitutions increased the unfolding energy 47 to 69 kJ/mol in a single engineering step. Crystal structures of stabilized variants showed small perturbations in helices 1 and 2, which rendered them closer in structure to the redesign template. This case study illustrates the capability of the method, which is applicable to any screen for protein function.

Abstract: Summary
The fusion of fluorescent proteins (FPs) to endogenous proteins is a widespread approach for microscopic examination of protein function, expression, and localization in the cell. However, proteins that are sensitive to FP fusion or expressed at low levels are difficult to monitor using this approach. Here, we develop a single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-FP approach to efficiently label Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins that are tagged with repeats of hemagglutinin (HA)-tag sequences. We demonstrate the successful labeling of DNA-binding proteins and proteins localized to different cellular organelles including the nuclear membrane, peroxisome, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria. This approach can lead to a significant increase in fluorescence intensity of the labeled protein, allows C′-terminal labeling of difficult-to-tag proteins and increased detection sensitivity of DNA-damage foci. Overall, the development of a scFv-FP labeling approach in yeast provides a general and simple tool for the function and localization analysis of the yeast proteome.

Abstract: Summary
How embryos scale patterning according to size is still not fully understood. Through in silico screening and analysis of reaction-diffusion systems that could be responsible for scaling, we predicted the existence of genes whose expression is sensitive to embryo size and which regulate the scaling of embryonic patterning. To find these scalers, we identified genes with strongly altered expression in half-size Xenopus laevis embryos compared with full-size siblings at the gastrula stage. Among found genes, we investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp3), which was most strongly downregulated in half-size embryos. We show that Mmp3 scales dorsal-ventral patterning by degrading the slowly diffusing embryonic inducers Noggin1 and Noggin2 but preventing cleavage of the more rapidly diffusing inducer Chordin via degradation of a Tolloid-type proteinase. In addition to unraveling the mechanism underlying the scaling of dorsal-ventral patterning, this work provides proof of principal for scalers identification in embryos of other species.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription of protein-coding genes is regulated by dynamic association of co-factors with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The function of these factors and their relationship with RNAPII is often poorly understood. Here, we present an approach for elongation-factor-specific mNET capture (ELCAP) of RNAPII complexes for sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis aimed at investigating the function of such RNAPII regulatory proteins. As proof of principle, we apply ELCAP to the RNAPII-associated proteins SCAF4 and SCAF8, which share an essential role as mRNA anti-terminators but have individual roles at the 3′ end of genes. Mass spectrometry analysis shows that both SCAF4 and SCAF8 are part of RNAPII elongation complexes containing 3′ end processing factors but depleted of splicing components. Importantly, the ELCAP sequencing (ELCAP-seq) profiles of SCAF4- and SCAF8-RNAPII complexes nicely reflect their function as mRNA-anti-terminators and their competing functions at the end of genes, where they prevent or promote transcriptional readthrough.

Abstract: Summary
Sperm chemotaxis is required for guiding sperm toward the egg. However, the molecular identity of physiological chemoattractant and its involvement in infertility remain elusive. Here, we identify DEFB19/119 (mouse/human orthologs) as a physiological sperm chemoattractant. The epithelia of the female reproductive tract and the cumulus-oocyte complex secrete DEFB19/119 that elicits calcium mobilization via the CatSper channel and induces sperm chemotaxis in capacitated sperm. Manipulating the level of DEFB19 in mice determines the number of sperm arriving at the fertilization site. Importantly, we identify exon mutations in the DEFB119 gene in idiopathic infertile women with low level of DEFB119 in the follicular fluid. The level of DEFB119 correlates with the chemotactic potency of follicular fluid and predicts the infertile outcome with positive correlation. This study reveals the pivotal role of DEFB19/119 in sperm chemotaxis and demonstrates its potential application in the diagnosis of idiopathic infertility.

Abstract: As a promising approach in tissue engineering, decellularization has become one of the mostly-studied research areas in tissue engineering thanks to its potential to bring about several advantages over synthetic materials since it can provide a 3-dimensional ECM structure with matching biomechanical properties of the target tissue. Amniotic membranes are the tissues that nurture the embryos during labor. Similarly, these materials have also been proposed for tissue regeneration in several applications. The main drawback in using amniotic membranes is the limited thickness of these materials since most tissues require a 3D matrix for an enhance regeneration. In order to prevent this limitation, here we report a facile fabrication methodology for multilayered amniotic membrane-based tissue constructs. The amniotic membranes of Wistar albino rats were first decellularized with the physical and chemical methods and utilized as scaffolds. Secondly, the prepared decellularized membranes were sutured to form a multilayered 3D structure. Within the study, 7 groups including control (PBS), were prepared based on physical and chemical decellularization methods. UV exposure and freezing techniques were used as a physical decellularization methods while hypertonic medium and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) protocols were used as chemical decellularization methods. The combinations of both protocols were also used. In groups, A was the control and group B was applied just UV. In group C was applied UV and freezing. In addition to UV and freezing, in group D was applied hypertonic solution while group E was applied SDS (0.03 %). In group F was applied UV, freezing, hypertonic solution and SDS (0.03 %). In group G was applied UV, hypertonic solution, SDS (0.03 %) and freezing, respectively. Based on the histological and quantitative analyses, F and G groups were found as the most efficient decellularization protocols in rat amniotic membranes. Then, group F and G decellularized amniotic membranes were used to form scaffolds and thus-formed matrices were further characterized in vitro cell culture studies and mechanical tests. Cytotoxicity analyses performed using MTT showed a good cell viability in F and G groups scaffolds. The percentage viability rate was higher in G group (81.3 %) compared to F (75.33 %) and also cell viability in G group was found more meaningful according to p value which was obtained 0.007. Cellular adhesions after in vitro cell culture and morphology of scaffolds were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that the cells cultivated in equal amounts of tissue scaffolds were higher in the F compared to that observed in group G. The mechanical testing with 40 N force revealed 0.77 mm displacement in group F while it was 0.75 mm in group G. Moreover, according to force-controlled test, 2.9 mm displacement of F group and 1.2 mm displacement of G group was measured. As a result, this study shows that the multilayered decellularized amniotic membrane scaffolds support cell survival and adhesion and can form a flexible biomaterial with desired handling properties.

Abstract: Summary
Most mitochondrial proteins are translated in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. Mutations in the mitochondrial protein import machinery cause human pathologies. However, a lack of suitable tools to measure protein uptake across the mitochondrial proteome has prevented the identification of specific proteins affected by import perturbation. Here, we introduce mePRODmt, a pulsed-SILAC based proteomics approach that includes a booster signal to increase the sensitivity for mitochondrial proteins selectively, enabling global dynamic analysis of endogenous mitochondrial protein uptake in cells. We applied mePRODmt to determine protein uptake kinetics and examined how inhibitors of mitochondrial import machineries affect protein uptake. Monitoring changes in translation and uptake upon mitochondrial membrane depolarization revealed that protein uptake was extensively modulated by the import and translation machineries via activation of the integrated stress response. Strikingly, uptake changes were not uniform, with subsets of proteins being unaffected or decreased due to changes in translation or import capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Invasive microbial pathogens often disrupt epithelial barriers, yet the mechanisms used to dismantle tight junctions are poorly understood. Here, we show that the obligate pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis uses the effector protein TepP to transiently disassemble tight junctions early during infection. TepP alters the tyrosine phosphorylation status of host proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation, including the filamentous actin-binding protein EPS8. We determined that TepP and EPS8 are necessary and sufficient to remodel tight junctions and that the ensuing disruption of epithelial barrier function promotes secondary invasion events. The genetic deletion of EPS8 renders epithelial cells and endometrial organoids resistant to TepP-mediated tight junction remodeling. Finally, TepP and EPS8 promote infection in murine models of infections, with TepP mutants displaying defects in ascension to the upper genital tract. These findings reveal a non-canonical function of EPS8 in the disassembly of epithelial junctions and an important role for Chlamydia pathogenesis.

Abstract: Background
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 mostly infects the respiratory system causing pneumonia; although it can also affect the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which covered with a bi-layer of mucus rich in glycosylated proteins that terminated by sialic acid. Therefore; this study aimed to evaluate serum total sialic acid (TSA) in moderate COVID-19 patients with and without GIT manifestations.
Methods
A total of 161 moderate COVID-19 patients without and with GIT manifestations and 50 controls were enrolled into our study. Serum electrolytes levels were measured by using colorimetric or turbidmetric commercial assay kits, while the level of serum TSA was measured by using a commercial ELISA kit.
Results
Our results showed that serum TSA level was highly significantly increased in moderate COVID-19 patients with GIT manifestations (81.43 ± 8.91) when compared with controls (61.24 ± 6.41) or even moderate COVID-19 patients without GIT manifestations (69.46 ± 7.03). ROC curve analysis showed that AUC for TSA is 0.84 with 76.2 % sensitivity and 73.7 % specificity in discrimination between moderate COVID-19 patients with and without GIT manifestations. Serum potassium and sodium levels were highly significantly decreased in moderate COVID-19 patients with GIT manifestations when compared with controls or even moderate COVID-19 patients without GIT manifestations; while serum calcium level was found to be significantly decreased in moderate COVID-19 patients with GIT manifestations when compared with controls.
Conclusion
Finally, we can conclude that SA plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of GIT complications associated with COVID-19 and could be a potential biomarker for the COVID-19 gastrointestinal complications.

Abstract: Specification of cellular polarity is vital to normal tissue development and function. Pioneering studies in Drosophila and C. elegans have elucidated the composition and dynamics of protein complexes critical for establishment of cell polarity, which is manifest in processes such as cell migration and asymmetric cell division. Conserved throughout metazoans, planar cell polarity (PCP) genes are implicated in disease, including neural tube closure defects associated with mutations in VANGL1/2. PCP protein regulation is well studied; however, relatively little is known about transcriptional regulation of these genes. Our earlier study revealed an unexpected role for the fly Rbf1 retinoblastoma corepressor protein, a regulator of cell cycle genes, in transcriptional regulation of polarity genes. Here we analyze the physiological relevance of the role of E2F/Rbf proteins in the transcription of the key core polarity gene Vang. Targeted mutations to the E2F site within the Vang promoter disrupts binding of E2F/Rbf proteins in vivo, leading to polarity defects in wing hairs. E2F regulation of Vang is supported by the requirement for this motif in a reporter gene. Interestingly, the promoter is repressed by overexpression of E2F1, a transcription factor generally identified as an activator. Consistent with the regulation of this polarity gene by E2F and Rbf factors, expression of Vang and other polarity genes is found to peak in G2/M phase in cells of the embryo and wing imaginal disc, suggesting that cell cycle signals may play a role in regulation of these genes. These findings suggest that the E2F/Rbf complex mechanistically links cell proliferation and polarity.

Abstract: Summary
Neural indicators of pain discriminability have far-reaching theoretical and clinical implications but have been largely overlooked previously. Here, to directly identify the neural basis of pain discriminability, we apply signal detection theory to three EEG (Datasets 1–3, total N = 366) and two fMRI (Datasets 4–5, total N = 399) datasets where participants receive transient stimuli of four sensory modalities (pain, touch, audition, and vision) and two intensities (high and low) and report perceptual ratings. Datasets 1 and 4 are used for exploration and others for validation. We find that most pain-evoked EEG and fMRI brain responses robustly encode pain discriminability, which is well replicated in validation datasets. The neural indicators are also pain selective since they cannot track tactile, auditory, or visual discriminability, even though perceptual ratings and sensory discriminability are well matched between modalities. Overall, we provide compelling evidence that pain-evoked brain responses can serve as replicable and selective neural indicators of pain discriminability.

Abstract: Summary
To understand what determines the success of short- and long-term weight loss, we conduct a secondary analysis of dietary, metabolic, and molecular data collected from 609 participants before, during, and after a 1-year weight-loss intervention with either a healthy low-carbohydrate (HLC) or a healthy low-fat (HLF) diet. Through systematic analysis of multidomain datasets, we find that dietary adherence and diet quality, not just caloric restriction, are important for short-term weight loss in both diets. Interestingly, we observe minimal dietary differences between those who succeeded in long-term weight loss and those who did not. Instead, proteomic and gut microbiota signatures significantly differ between these two groups at baseline. Moreover, the baseline respiratory quotient may suggest a specific diet for better weight-loss outcomes. Overall, the identification of these dietary, molecular, and metabolic factors, common or unique to the HLC and HLF diets, provides a roadmap for developing individualized weight-loss strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in PINK1 cause autosomal-recessive Parkinson’s disease. Mitochondrial damage results in PINK1 import arrest on the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, resulting in the activation of its ubiquitin kinase activity by autophosphorylation and initiation of Parkin-dependent mitochondrial clearance. Herein, we report crystal structures of the entire cytosolic domain of insect PINK1. Our structures reveal a dimeric autophosphorylation complex targeting phosphorylation at the invariant Ser205 (human Ser228). The dimer interface requires insert 2, which is unique to PINK1. The structures also reveal how an N-terminal helix binds to the C-terminal extension and provide insights into stabilization of PINK1 on the core TOM complex.

Abstract: Injuries to equine tendons and ligaments are career-compromising, causing reduced performance and premature retirement. Promising treatment alternatives have been investigated in the field of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, the tissue adherence and protein expression of tenogenic primed mesenchymal stem cells (tpMSCs) after administration to ex vivo tendon and ligament explants is investigated. First, collagen type I (COL I) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression was assessed in cytospins prepared from native MSCs and tpMSCs. Second, equine superficial digital flexor tendon and suspensory ligament explants were cultivated, and a lesion was treated with both cell types. Subsequently, cell adhesion to the explants and the amount of COL I and SMA positive cells was evaluated. The cytospins revealed a significantly higher COL I and lower SMA expression in tpMSCs compared to native MSCs. In the explants, tpMSCs showed a significantly higher tendon and ligament adherence. Furthermore, a significantly higher percentage of COL I positive and a lower percentage of SMA positive cells were observed in the lesions treated with tpMSCs. The results of these explant co-cultures may demonstrate at least a part of the mechanism of action and functional properties of tpMSCs in restoring function to tendons and ligaments.

Combining multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches, we identified the presence of stem cells in the adult DRG satellite glial population, and progenitors were present in the DRGs and sciatic nerve. Cell-specific transgenic mouse lines highlighted the proliferative potential of DRG stem cells and progenitors in vitro. DRG stem cells had gliogenic and neurogenic potentials, whereas progenitors were essentially gliogenic. Lineage tracing showed that, under physiological conditions, adult DRG stem cells maintained DRG homeostasis by supplying satellite glia. Under pathological conditions, adult DRG stem cells replaced DRG neurons lost to injury in addition of renewing the satellite glial pool. These novel findings open new avenues for development of therapeutic strategies targeting DRG stem cells for PNS disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging variants of concern for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can transmit more efficiently and partially evade protective immune responses, thus necessitating continued refinement of antibody therapies and immunogen design. Here, we elucidate the structural basis and mode of action for two potent SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, CV3-1 and CV3-25, which remain effective against emerging variants of concern in vitro and in vivo. CV3-1 binds to the (485-GFN-487) loop within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the “RBD-up” position and triggers potent shedding of the S1 subunit. In contrast, CV3-25 inhibits membrane fusion by binding to an epitope in the stem helix region of the S2 subunit that is highly conserved among β-coronaviruses. Thus, vaccine immunogen designs that incorporate the conserved regions in the RBD and stem helix region are candidates to elicit pan-coronavirus protective immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
When crawling through the body, leukocytes often traverse tissues that are densely packed with extracellular matrix and other cells, and this raises the question: How do leukocytes overcome compressive mechanical loads? Here, we show that the actin cortex of leukocytes is mechanoresponsive and that this responsiveness requires neither force sensing via the nucleus nor adhesive interactions with a substrate. Upon global compression of the cell body as well as local indentation of the plasma membrane, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) assembles into dot-like structures, providing activation platforms for Arp2/3 nucleated actin patches. These patches locally push against the external load, which can be obstructing collagen fibers or other cells, and thereby create space to facilitate forward locomotion. We show in vitro and in vivo that this WASp function is rate limiting for ameboid leukocyte migration in dense but not in loose environments and is required for trafficking through diverse tissues such as skin and lymph nodes.

Abstract: Summary
A common pathological feature of RNAs containing expanded repeat sequences is their propensity to aggregate in cells. While some repeat RNA aggregates have been shown to cause toxicity by sequestering RNA-binding proteins, the molecular mechanism of aggregation remains unclear. Here, we devised an efficient method to generate long tandem repeat DNAs de novo and applied it to systematically determine the sequence features underlying RNA aggregation. Live-cell imaging of repeat RNAs indicated that aggregation was promoted by multivalent RNA-RNA interactions via either canonical or noncanonical base pairs. While multiple runs of two consecutive base pairs were sufficient, longer runs of base pairs such as those formed by GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats further enhanced aggregation. In summary, our study provides a unifying model for the molecular basis of repeat RNA aggregation and a generalizable approach for identifying the sequence and structural determinants underlying the distinct properties of repeat DNAs and RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is the leading cause of graft failure. While donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) are associated with a higher risk of AMR, not all patients with DSAs develop rejection, suggesting that the characteristics of alloantibodies determining their pathogenicity remain undefined. Using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-specific antibodies as a model, we apply systems serology tools to investigate qualitative features of immunoglobulin G (IgG) alloantibodies including Fc-glycosylation patterns and FcγR-binding properties. Levels of afucosylated anti-A2 antibodies are elevated in seropositive patients, especially those with AMR, suggesting potential cytotoxicity via FcγRIII-mediated mechanisms. Afucosylation of both glycoengineered monoclonal and naturally glycovariant polyclonal serum IgG specific to HLA-A2 drives potentiated binding to, slower dissociation from, and enhanced signaling through FcγRIII, a receptor widely expressed on innate effector cells, and greater cytotoxicity against HLA-A2+ cells mediated by natural killer (NK) cells. Collectively, these results suggest that afucosylated DSA may be a biomarker of AMR and contribute to pathogenesis.

Abstract: MiR-216b is ectopically expressed in various cancers. Ultrasound microbubbles (UTMBs) are an effective method for miRNA delivery. This article mainly explored the involvement of lncRNA in the effects of UTMBs-mediated miR-216b on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression. Expressions and relationship of miR-216b and MALAT1 were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Pearson, TargetScan, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. After the transfection with liposome- or UTMBs-mediated miR-216b mimic (M) or MALAT1 overexpression plasmid alone or together, levels of miR-216b and MALAT1, cell biological behaviors, as well as expressions of apoptosis- and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers were examined using qRT-PCR, cell functional experiments, and western blot. Besides, we used qRT-PCR to quantify the expressions of multiple downstream miRNAs of MALAT1. MiR-216b expression was weakened yet MALAT1 expression was enhanced in NSCLC tissues, and miR-216b was negatively bound to MALAT1. TargetScan analysis manifested that miR-216b, targeted by MALAT1, was down-regulated in NSCLC cells. UTMBs-mediated miR-216b M further intensified miR-216b level yet weakened cell biological behaviors. The inhibitory effect of UTMBs-mediated miR-216b M on cell biological behaviors and MALAT1 expression was greatly better relative to that of miR-216b M. Moreover, miR-216b restrained the cell biological behaviors by repressing MALAT1 expression. We further manifested that miR-216b facilitated the expressions of apoptosis-related markers, but restrained those of EMT-related markers by repressing MALAT1 expression. Moreover, UTMBs-mediated miR-216b M enhanced the expressions of downstream multiple miRNAs of MALAT1, but this tendency was reversed by co-transfection of overexpressed MALAT1 and miR-216b M. Collectively, UTMBs-mediated miR-216b M restrained NSCLC cell growth by modulating the MALAT1-miRNA axis.

Abstract: Summary
Early and accurate detection of side effects is critical for the clinical success of drugs under development. Here, we aim to predict unknown side effects for drugs with a small number of side effects identified in randomized controlled clinical trials. Our machine learning framework, the geometric self-expressive model (GSEM), learns globally optimal self-representations for drugs and side effects from pharmacological graph networks. We show the usefulness of the GSEM on 505 therapeutically diverse drugs and 904 side effects from multiple human physiological systems. Here, we also show a data integration strategy that could be adopted to improve the ability of side effect prediction models to identify unknown side effects that might only appear after the drug enters the market.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell spatial transcriptomics (sc-ST) holds the promise to elucidate architectural aspects of complex tissues. Such analyses require modeling cell types in sc-ST datasets through their integration with single-cell RNA-seq datasets. However, this integration, is nontrivial since the two technologies differ widely in the number of profiled genes, and the datasets often do not share many marker genes for given cell types. We developed a neural network model, spatial transcriptomics cell-types assignment using neural networks (STANN), to overcome these challenges. Analysis of STANN’s predicted cell types in mouse olfactory bulb (MOB) sc-ST data delineated MOB architecture beyond its morphological layer-based conventional description. We find that cell-type proportions remain consistent within individual morphological layers but vary significantly between layers. Notably, even within a layer, cellular colocalization patterns and intercellular communication mechanisms show high spatial variations. These observations imply a refinement of major cell types into subtypes characterized by spatially localized gene regulatory networks and receptor-ligand usage.

Regulation of Myt1 kinase activity via its N-terminal region in Xenopus meiosis and mitosis,

Abstract: Immature animal oocytes are naturally arrested at the first meiotic prophase (Pro-I), which corresponds to the G2 phase of the cell cycle. In Xenopus oocytes, Myt1 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) at Pro-I, thereby preventing oocytes from entering meiosis I (MI) prematurely. Previous studies have shown that, upon resuming MI, Cdk1 and p90rsk, which is a downstream kinase of the Mos-MAPK pathway, in turn phosphorylate the C-terminal region of Myt1, to suppress its activity, thereby ensuring high Cdk1 activity during M phase. However, the roles of the N-terminal region of Myt1 during meiosis and mitosis remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that the N-terminal region of Myt1 participates in the regulation of Myt1 activity in the Xenopus cell cycle. In particular, we found that a short, conserved sequence in the N-terminal region, termed here as the PAYF motif, is required for the normal activity of Myt1 in oocytes. Furthermore, multiple phosphorylations by Cdk1 at the Myt1 N-terminal region were found to be involved in the negative regulation of Myt1. In particular, phosphorylations at Thr11 and Thr16 of Myt1, which are adjacent to the PAYF motif, were found to be important for the inactivation of Myt1 in the M phase of the cell cycle. These results suggest that in addition to the regulation of Myt1 activity via the C-terminal region, the N-terminal region of Myt1 also plays an important role in the regulation of Myt1 activity.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of RNAs to form specific contacts with other macromolecules provides an important mechanism for subcellular compartmentalization. Here we describe a suite of hybridization-proximity (HyPro) labeling technologies for unbiased discovery of proteins (HyPro-MS) and transcripts (HyPro-seq) associated with RNAs of interest in genetically unperturbed cells. As a proof of principle, we show that HyPro-MS and HyPro-seq can identify both known and previously unexplored spatial neighbors of the noncoding RNAs 45S, NEAT1, and PNCTR expressed at markedly different levels. Notably, HyPro-seq uncovers an extensive repertoire of incompletely processed, adenosine-to-inosine-edited transcripts accumulating at the interface between their encoding chromosomal regions and the NEAT1-containing paraspeckle compartment. At least some of these targets require NEAT1 for their optimal expression. Overall, this study provides a versatile toolkit for dissecting RNA interactomes in diverse biomedical contexts and expands our understanding of the functional architecture of the mammalian nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Arabidopsis BAK1/SERK3, a co-receptor of leucine-rich repeat pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), mediates pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Genetic inactivation of BAK1 or BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinases (BIRs) causes cell death, but the direct mechanisms leading to such deregulation remains unclear. Here, we found that the TIR-NBS-LRR protein CONSTITUTIVE SHADE AVOIDANCE 1 (CSA1) physically interacts with BIR3, but not with BAK1. CSA1 mediates cell death in bak1-4 and bak1-4 bir3-2 mutants via components of effector-triggered immunity-(ETI) pathways. Effector HopB1-mediated perturbation of BAK1 also results in CSA1-dependent cell death. Likewise, microbial pattern pg23-induced cell death, but not PTI responses, requires CSA1. Thus, we show that CSA1 guards BIR3 BAK1 homeostasis and integrates pattern- and effector-mediated cell death pathways downstream of BAK1. De-repression of CSA1 in the absence of intact BAK1 and BIR3 triggers ETI cell death. This suggests that PTI and ETI pathways are activated downstream of BAK1 for efficient plant immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Limited sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostics lead to the erroneous prescription of antibiotics. Host-response-based diagnostics could address these challenges. However, using 4,200 samples across 69 blood transcriptome datasets from 20 countries from patients with bacterial or viral infections representing a broad spectrum of biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity, we show current host-response-based gene signatures have lower accuracy to distinguish intracellular bacterial infections from viral infections than extracellular bacterial infections. Using these 69 datasets, we identify an 8-gene signature to distinguish intracellular or extracellular bacterial infections from viral infections with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) > 0.91 (85.9% specificity and 90.2% sensitivity). In prospective cohorts from Nepal and Laos, the 8-gene classifier distinguished bacterial infections from viral infections with an AUROC of 0.94 (87.9% specificity and 91% sensitivity). The 8-gene signature meets the target product profile proposed by the World Health Organization and others for distinguishing bacterial and viral infections.

Abstract: Summary
Chemically modified mRNA (CMmRNA) with selectively altered nucleotides are used to deliver transgenes, but translation efficiency is variable. We have transfected CMmRNA encoding human T-box transcription factor 18 (CMmTBX18) into heart cells or the left ventricle of rats with atrioventricular block. TBX18 protein expression from CMmTBX18 is weak and transient, but Acriflavine, an Argonaute 2 inhibitor, boosts TBX18 levels. Small RNA sequencing identified two upregulated microRNAs (miRs) in CMmTBX18-transfected cells. Co-administration of miR-1-3p and miR-1b antagomiRs with CMmTBX18 prolongs TBX18 expression in vitro and in vivo and is sufficient to generate electrical stimuli capable of pacing the heart. Different suppressive miRs likewise limit the expression of VEGF-A CMmRNA. Cells therefore resist translation of CMmRNA therapeutic transgenes by upregulating suppressive miRs. Blockade of suppressive miRs enhances CMmRNA expression of genes driving biological pacing or angiogenesis. Such counterstrategies constitute an approach to boost the efficacy and efficiency of CMmRNA therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome structure and function is studied using various cell-based methods as well as with a range of in vitro single-molecule techniques on short DNA substrates. Here, we present a method to obtain megabase-pair-length deproteinated DNA for in vitro studies. We isolated chromosomes from bacterial cells and enzymatically digested the native proteins. Mass spectrometry indicated that 97%–100% of DNA-binding proteins are removed from the sample. Fluorescence microscopy analysis showed an increase in the radius of gyration of the DNA polymers, while the DNA length remained megabase-pair sized. In proof-of-concept experiments using these deproteinated long DNA molecules, we observed DNA compaction upon adding the DNA-binding protein Fis or PEG crowding agents and showed that it is possible to track the motion of a fluorescently labeled DNA locus. These results indicate the practical feasibility of a “genome-in-a-box” approach to study chromosome organization from the bottom up.

Abstract: Summary
Encouraged by the dependence of drug-resistant, metastatic cancers on GPX4, we examined biophysical mechanisms of GPX4 inhibition, which revealed an unexpected allosteric site. We found that this site was involved in native regeneration of GPX4 under low glutathione conditions. Covalent binding of inhibitors to this allosteric site caused a conformational change, inhibition of activity, and subsequent cellular GPX4 protein degradation. To verify this site in an unbiased manner, we screened a library of compounds and identified and validated that an additional compound can covalently bind in this allosteric site, inhibiting and degrading GPX4. We determined co-crystal structures of six different inhibitors bound in this site. We have thus identified an allosteric mechanism for small molecules targeting aggressive cancers dependent on GPX4.

Abstract: Summary
We report Cytopath, a method for trajectory inference that takes advantage of transcriptional activity information from the RNA velocity of single cells to perform trajectory inference. Cytopath performs this task by defining a Markov chain model, simulating an ensemble of possible differentiation trajectories, and constructing a consensus trajectory. We show that Cytopath can recapitulate the topological and molecular characteristics of the differentiation process under study. In our analysis, we include differentiation trajectories with varying bifurcated, circular, convergent, and mixed topologies studied in single-snapshot as well as time-series single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. We demonstrate the capability to reconstruct differentiation trajectories, assess the association of RNA velocity-based pseudotime with actually elapsed process time, and identify drawbacks in current state-of-the art trajectory inference approaches.

Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical basis for the observed relationship between cell arrangements in notochords and analog physical models, and the eccentricity of their cross sections. Three models are developed and analyzed, of the mechanics of cell packing in sheaths. The key ratios governing the packing patterns and eccentricity are cells per unit length λ, tension ratio Γ, and eccentricity e. For flexible and semi-flexible sheaths, the optimal packing pattern shifts from “bamboo”, with a symmetric cross section, to “staircase”, with an eccentric cross section, at a critical value λ = 1.13. In rigid tubes, this threshold is lowered as imposed eccentricity is increased. Patterns can be observed which are not optimal; pattern transitions may occur below or above the critical λ values. The eccentricity of staircase patterns in flexible and semi-flexible tubes is found to be dependent on the tension ratio Γ, increasing as sheath tension decreases relative to interior cell tension. A novel “serpentine” packing pattern appears for low Γ near the critical λ. The developmental utility of enforcing notochord eccentricity is discussed, as well as potential mechanisms for such control.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is common and highly heritable. Genetic studies of hepatic fat have not sufficiently addressed non-European and rare variants. In a medical biobank, we quantitate hepatic fat from clinical computed tomography (CT) scans via deep learning in 10,283 participants with whole-exome sequences available. We conduct exome-wide associations of single variants and rare predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants with CT-based hepatic fat and perform cross-modality replication in the UK Biobank (UKB) by linking whole-exome sequences to MRI-based hepatic fat. We confirm single variants previously associated with hepatic fat and identify several additional variants, including two (FGD5 H600Y and CITED2 S198_G199del) that replicated in UKB. A burden of rare pLOF variants in LMF2 is associated with increased hepatic fat and replicates in UKB. Quantitative phenotypes generated from clinical imaging studies and intersected with genomic data in medical biobanks have the potential to identify molecular pathways associated with human traits and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies enable both the measurement of genome-wide gene expression profiles and their mapping to spatial locations within a tissue. A first step in spatial transcriptomics data analysis is identifying genes with expression that varies spatially, and robust statistical methods exist to address this challenge. While useful, these methods do not detect spatial changes in the coordinated expression within a group of genes. To this end, we present SpatialCorr, a method for identifying sets of genes with spatially varying correlation structure. Given a collection of gene sets pre-defined by a user, SpatialCorr tests for spatially induced differences in the correlation of each gene set within tissue regions, as well as between and among regions. An application to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma demonstrates the power of the approach for revealing biological insights not identified using existing methods.

Abstract: Summary
Fate decisions in developing tissues involve cells transitioning between discrete cell states, each defined by distinct gene expression profiles. The Waddington landscape, in which the development of a cell is viewed as a ball rolling through a valley filled terrain, is an appealing way to describe differentiation. To construct and validate accurate landscapes, quantitative methods based on experimental data are necessary. We combined principled statistical methods with a framework based on catastrophe theory and approximate Bayesian computation to formulate a quantitative dynamical landscape that accurately predicts cell fate outcomes of pluripotent stem cells exposed to different combinations of signaling factors. Analysis of the landscape revealed two distinct ways in which cells make a binary choice between one of two fates. We suggest that these represent archetypal designs for developmental decisions. The approach is broadly applicable for the quantitative analysis of differentiation and for determining the logic of developmental decisions.

Abstract: Zinc transporter 1 (ZnT1; SLC30A1) is present in the neuronal plasma membrane, critically modulating NMDA receptor function and Zn2+ neurotoxicity. The mechanism mediating Zn2+ transport by ZnT1, however, has remained elusive. Here, we investigated ZnT1-dependent Zn2+ transport by measuring intracellular changes of this ion using the fluorescent indicator FluoZin-3. In primary mouse cortical neurons, which express ZnT1, transient addition of extracellular Zn2+ triggered a rise in cytosolic Zn2+, followed by its removal. Knockdown of ZnT1 by adeno associated viral (AAV)-short hairpin RNA (shZnT1) markedly increased rates of Zn2+ rise, and decreased rates of its removal, suggesting that ZnT1 is a primary route for Zn2+ efflux in neurons. Although Zn2+ transport by other members of the SLC30A family is dependent on pH gradients across cellular membranes, altered H+ gradients were not coupled to ZnT1-dependent transport. Removal of cytoplasmic Zn2+, against a large inward gradient during the initial loading phase, suggests that Zn2+ efflux requires a large driving force. We therefore asked if Ca2+ gradients across the membrane can facilitate Zn2+ efflux. Elimination of extracellular Ca2+ abolished Zn2+ efflux, while increased extracellular Ca2+ levels enhanced Zn2+ efflux. Intracellular Ca2+ rises, measured in GCaMP6 expressing neurons, closely paralleled cytoplasmic Zn2+ removal. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that ZnT1 functions as a Zn2+/Ca2+ exchanger, thereby regulating the transport of two ions of fundamental importance in neuronal signaling.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, gut commensal microbiota interact extensively with the host, and the same interactions can be dysregulated in diseased states. Animal imaging is a powerful technique that is widely used to diagnose, measure, and track biological changes in model organisms such as laboratory mice. Several imaging techniques have been discovered and adopted by the research community that provide dynamic, non-invasive assessment of live animals, but these gains have not been universal across all fields of biology. Herein, we describe a method to non-invasively image commensal bacteria based on the specific metabolic labeling of bacterial cell walls to illuminate the gut bacteria of live mice. This tagging strategy may additionally provide unprecedented insight into cell wall turnover of gut commensals, which has implications for bacterial cellular growth and division, in a live animal.

Abstract: Summary
Despite rapid clinical translation of COVID-19 vaccines in response to the global pandemic, an opportunity remains for vaccine technology innovation to address current limitations and meet challenges of inevitable future pandemics. We describe a universal vaccine cell (UVC) genetically engineered to mimic natural physiological immunity induced upon viral infection of host cells. Cells engineered to express the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike as a representative viral antigen induce robust neutralizing antibodies in immunized non-human primates. Similar titers generated in this established non-human primate (NHP) model have translated into protective human neutralizing antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated individuals. Animals vaccinated with ancestral spike antigens and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in a heterologous challenge have an approximately 3 log decrease in viral subgenomic RNA in the lungs. This cellular vaccine is designed as a scalable cell line with a modular poly-antigenic payload, allowing for rapid, large-scale clinical manufacturing and use in an evolving viral variant environment.

Abstract: Summary
We present a deep proteogenomic profiling study of 87 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors from the United States, integrating whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, proteomics and phosphoproteomics by mass spectrometry, and reverse-phase protein arrays. We identify three subtypes from somatic genome signature analysis, including a transition-high subtype enriched with never smokers, a transversion-high subtype enriched with current smokers, and a structurally altered subtype enriched with former smokers, TP53 alterations, and genome-wide structural alterations. We show that within-tumor correlations of RNA and protein expression associate with tumor purity and immune cell profiles. We detect and independently validate expression signatures of RNA and protein that predict patient survival. Additionally, among co-measured genes, we found that protein expression is more often associated with patient survival than RNA. Finally, integrative analysis characterizes three expression subtypes with divergent mutations, proteomic regulatory networks, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. This proteogenomic characterization provides a foundation for molecularly informed medicine in LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
Lyme disease (LD) is tick-borne disease whose post-treatment sequelae are not well understood. For this study, we enrolled 152 individuals with symptoms of post-treatment LD (PTLD) to profile their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Combined with RNA-seq data from 72 individuals with acute LD and 44 uninfected controls, we investigated differences in differential gene expression. We observe that most individuals with PTLD have an inflammatory signature that is distinguished from the acute LD group. By distilling gene sets from this study with gene sets from other sources, we identify a subset of genes that are highly expressed in the cohorts but are not already established as biomarkers for inflammatory response or other viral or bacterial infections. We further reduce this gene set by feature importance to establish an mRNA biomarker set capable of distinguishing healthy individuals from those with acute LD or PTLD as a candidate for translation into an LD diagnostic.

Abstract: Summary
Markers are increasingly being used for several high-throughput data analysis and experimental design tasks. Examples include the use of markers for assigning cell types in scRNA-seq studies, for deconvolving bulk gene expression data, and for selecting marker proteins in single-cell spatial proteomics studies. Most marker selection methods focus on differential expression (DE) analysis. Although such methods work well for data with a few non-overlapping marker sets, they are not appropriate for large atlas-size datasets where several cell types and tissues are considered. To address this, we define the phenotype cover (PC) problem for marker selection and present algorithms that can improve the discriminative power of marker sets. Analysis of these sets on several marker-selection tasks suggests that these methods can lead to solutions that accurately distinguish different phenotypes in the data.

Abstract: Summary
We explored opportunities for personalized and predictive health care by collecting serial clinical measurements, health surveys, genomics, proteomics, autoantibodies, metabolomics, and gut microbiome data from 96 individuals who participated in a data-driven health coaching program over a 16-month period with continuous digital monitoring of activity and sleep. We generated a resource of >20,000 biological samples from this study and a compendium of >53 million primary data points for 558,032 distinct features. Multiomics factor analysis revealed distinct and independent molecular factors linked to obesity, diabetes, liver function, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immunity, exercise, diet, and hormonal effects. For example, ethinyl estradiol, a common oral contraceptive, produced characteristic molecular and physiological effects, including increased levels of inflammation and impact on thyroid, cortisol levels, and pulse, that were distinct from other sources of variability observed in our study. In total, this work illustrates the value of combining deep molecular and digital monitoring of human health.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic cancer cells with limited access to free amino acids can grow by scavenging extracellular protein. In a murine model of pancreatic cancer, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen for genes required for scavenging-dependent growth. The screen identified key mediators of macropinocytosis, peripheral lysosome positioning, endosome-lysosome fusion, lysosomal protein catabolism, and translational control. The top hit was GCN2, a kinase that suppresses translation initiation upon amino acid depletion. Using isotope tracers, we show that GCN2 is not required for protein scavenging. Instead, GCN2 prevents ribosome stalling but without slowing protein synthesis; cells still use all of the limiting amino acids as they emerge from lysosomes. GCN2 also adapts gene expression to the nutrient-poor environment, reorienting protein synthesis away from ribosomes and toward lysosomal hydrolases, such as cathepsin L. GCN2, cathepsin L, and the other genes identified in the screen are potential therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), especially CD8+ TILs, represent a favorable prognostic factor in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and other tumor lineages. Here, we analyze the spatial heterogeneity of different TIL subtypes in HGSOC. We integrated RNA sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, bulk T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, as well as single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing to investigate the characteristics and differential composition of TILs across different HGSOC sites. Two immune “cold” patterns in ovarian cancer are identified: (1) ovarian lesions with low infiltration of mainly dysfunctional T cells and immunosuppressive Treg cells and (2) omental lesions infiltrated with non-tumor-specific bystander cells. Exhausted CD8 T cells that are preferentially enriched in ovarian tumors exhibit evidence for expansion and cytotoxic activity. Inherent tumor immune microenvironment characteristics appear to be the main contributor to the spatial differences in TIL status. The landscape of spatial heterogeneity of TILs may inform potential strategies for therapeutic manipulation in HGSOC.

Abstract: Summary
We recently determined that the excitatory manipulation of Qrfp-expressing neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (quiescence-inducing neurons [Q neurons]) induced a hibernation-like hypothermic/hypometabolic state (QIH) in mice. To control the QIH with a higher time resolution, we develop an optogenetic method using modified human opsin4 (OPN4; also known as melanopsin), a G protein-coupled-receptor-type blue-light photoreceptor. C-terminally truncated OPN4 (OPN4dC) stably and reproducibly induces QIH for at least 24 h by illumination with low-power light (3 μW, 473 nm laser) with high temporal resolution. The high sensitivity of OPN4dC allows us to transcranially stimulate Q neurons with blue-light-emitting diodes and non-invasively induce the QIH. OPN4dC-mediated QIH recapitulates the kinetics of the physiological changes observed in natural hibernation, revealing that Q neurons concurrently contribute to thermoregulation and cardiovascular function. This optogenetic method may facilitate identification of the neural mechanisms underlying long-term dormancy states such as sleep, daily torpor, and hibernation.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-binding proteins are promising therapeutic targets but are notoriously difficult to drug. Here, we evaluate a chemoproteomic DNA interaction platform as a complementary strategy for parallelized compound profiling. To enable this approach, we determined the proteomic binding landscape of 92 immobilized DNA sequences. Perturbation-induced activity changes of captured transcription factors in disease-relevant settings demonstrated functional relevance of the enriched subproteome. Chemoproteomic profiling of >300 cysteine-directed compounds against a coverage optimized bead mixture, which specifically captures >150 DNA binders, revealed competition of several DNA-binding proteins, including the transcription factors ELF1 and ELF2. We also discovered the first compound that displaces the DNA-repair complex MSH2-MSH3 from DNA. Compound binding to cysteine 252 on MSH3 was confirmed using chemoproteomic reactive cysteine profiling. Overall, these results suggested that chemoproteomic DNA bead pull-downs enable the specific readout of transcription factor activity and can identify functional “hotspots” on DNA binders toward expanding the druggable proteome.

Abstract: Summary
Orexin neuropeptides carry out important neuromodulatory functions in the brain, yet tools to precisely control the activation of endogenous orexin signaling are lacking. Here, we developed a photocaged orexin-B (photo-OXB) through a C-terminal photocaging strategy. We show that photo-OXB is unable to activate its cognate receptors in the dark but releases functionally active native orexin-B upon uncaging by illumination with UV-visible (UV-vis) light (370–405 nm). We established an all-optical assay combining photo-OXB with a genetically encoded orexin biosensor and used it to characterize the efficiency and spatial profile of photo-OXB uncaging. Finally, we demonstrated that photo-OXB enables optical control over orexin signaling with fine temporal precision both in vitro and ex vivo. Thus, our photocaging strategy and photo-OXB advance the chemical biological toolkit by introducing a method for the optical control of peptide signaling and physiological function.

Abstract: Summary
For microbiome biology to become a more predictive science, we must identify which descriptive features of microbial communities are reproducible and predictable, which are not, and why. We address this question by experimentally studying parallelism and convergence in microbial community assembly in replicate glucose-limited habitats. Here, we show that the previously observed family-level convergence in these habitats reflects a reproducible metabolic organization, where the ratio of the dominant metabolic groups can be explained from a simple resource-partitioning model. In turn, taxonomic divergence among replicate communities arises from multistability in population dynamics. Multistability can also lead to alternative functional states in closed ecosystems but not in metacommunities. Our findings empirically illustrate how the evolutionary conservation of quantitative metabolic traits, multistability, and the inherent stochasticity of population dynamics, may all conspire to generate the patterns of reproducibility and variability at different levels of organization that are commonplace in microbial community assembly.

Abstract: Summary
During infection, Salmonella hijacks essential host signaling pathways. These molecular manipulations disrupt cellular integrity and may induce oncogenic transformation. Systemic S. Typhi infections are linked to gallbladder cancer, whereas severe non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infections are associated with colon cancer (CC). These diagnosed infections, however, represent only a small fraction of all NTS infections as many infections are mild and go unnoticed. To assess the overall impact of NTS infections, we performed a retrospective serological study on NTS exposure in patients with CC. The magnitude of exposure to NTS, as measured by serum antibody titer, is significantly positively associated with CC. Repetitively infecting mice with low NTS exposure showed similar accelerated tumor growth to that observed after high NTS exposure. At the cellular level, NTS preferably infects (pre-)transformed cells, and each infection round exponentially increases the rate of transformed cells. Thus, repetitive exposure to NTS associates with CC risk and accelerates tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
The Waddington epigenetic landscape has become an iconic representation of the cellular differentiation process. Recent single-cell transcriptomic data provide new opportunities for quantifying this originally conceptual tool, offering insight into the gene regulatory networks underlying cellular development. While many methods for constructing the landscape have been proposed, by far the most commonly employed approach is based on computing the landscape as the negative logarithm of the steady-state probability distribution. Here, we use simple models to highlight the complexities and limitations that arise when reconstructing the potential landscape in the presence of stochastic fluctuations. We consider how the landscape changes in accordance with different stochastic systems and show that it is the subtle interplay between the deterministic and stochastic components of the system that ultimately shapes the landscape. We further discuss how the presence of noise has important implications for the identifiability of the regulatory dynamics from experimental data. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: How homeostatic ER calcium fluxes shape cellular calcium signals is still poorly understood. Here we used dual-color calcium imaging (ER-cytosol) and transcriptome analysis to link candidates of the calcium toolkit of astrocytes with homeostatic calcium signals. We found molecular and pharmacological evidence that P/Q-type channel Cacna1a contributes to depolarization-dependent calcium entry in astrocytes. For stimulated ER calcium release, the cells express the phospholipase Cb3, IP3 receptors Itpr1 and Itpr2, but no ryanodine receptors (Ryr1–3). After IP3-induced calcium release, Stim1/2 – Orai1/2/3 most likely mediate SOCE. The Serca2 (Atp2a2) is the candidate for refilling of the ER calcium store. The cells highly express adenosine receptor Adora1a for IP3-induced calcium release. Accordingly, adenosine induces fast ER calcium release and subsequent ER calcium oscillations. After stimulation, calcium refilling of the ER depends on extracellular calcium. In response to SOCE, astrocytes show calcium-induced calcium release, notably even after ER calcium was depleted by extracellular calcium removal in unstimulated cells. In contrast, spontaneous ER-cytosol calcium oscillations were not fully dependent on extracellular calcium, as ER calcium oscillations could persist over minutes in calcium-free solution. Additionally, cell-autonomous calcium oscillations show a second-long spatial and temporal delay in the signal dynamics of ER and cytosolic calcium. Our data reveal a rather strong contribution of homeostatic calcium fluxes in shaping IP3-induced and calcium-induced calcium release as well as spatiotemporal components of intracellular calcium oscillations.

Abstract: The phenotypic function of macrophages varies with the local microenvironment. Macrophages play an important role in the development of periodontitis. As one of the sources of GPNMB protein, the phenotype of macrophages is affected by GPNMB expression. In this study, activated macrophages were evaluated by flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and WB, and M2a macrophages had higher GPNMB expression than M0 and M1 macrophages. On this basis, a macrophage model with overexpression of GPNMB was established, and it was observed that GPNMB overexpression promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors by macrophages and inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by M1 macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
A schematic of a biological system, i.e., a representation of its pieces, how they are combined, and what they do, would facilitate understanding its essential organization and alteration in pathogenesis or evolution. We present a computational approach for constructing tissue schematics (TSs) from high-parameter imaging data and a biological model for interpreting them. TSs map the spatial assembly of cellular neighborhoods into tissue motifs, whose modular composition, we propose, enables the generation of complex outputs. We developed our approach in human lymphoid tissue (HLT), identifying the follicular outer zone as a potential relay between neighboring zones and a core lymphoid assembly with modifications characteristic of each HLT type. Applying the TS approach to the tumor microenvironment in human colorectal cancer identified a higher-order motif, whose mutated assembly was negatively associated with patient survival. TSs may therefore elucidate how immune architectures can be specialized and become vulnerable to reprogramming by tumors.

Abstract: Fabrication of immunocompatible tissue constructs for bone-cartilage defect regeneration is of prime importance. In this study, a double layer hydrogel was successfully synthesized, where alginate/polyacrylamide were formulated to represent cartilage layer (5–10 % (w/w) total polymer ratio) and laponite XLS (2−5-8% (w/w))/alginate/polyacrylamide formed bone layer. Hydrogels were dried by supercritical CO2 at 100 and 200 bar, 45 °C, 5 g/min CO2 flow rate for 2 h. Constructs were treated with collagen, then cellularized and embedded in cell-laden GelMA to mimic the cellular microenvironment. The optimum weight ratio of alginate/polyacrylamide:laponite XLS was 10:5 based on mechanical strength test results. The constructs yielded high porosity (91.50 m2/g) and mesoporous structure, owing to the diffusivity of CO2 at 200 bar (0.49 × 10−7  m2/s). Constructs were then treated with collagen to increase cell adhesion and ATDC5 cells were seeded in the cartilage layer, whereas hFOB cells to the bone layer. About 10–15 % higher cell viability was attained. The porous structure of the construct allowed infiltration of macrophages, promoted polarization and positively affected the behavior of macrophages, yielding a decrease in M1 markers, whereas an increase in M2 on day 4. The formulated tissue constructs would be of value in tissue engineering applications.

Abstract: Summary
The fidelity of the early embryonic program is underlined by tight regulation of the chromatin. Yet, how the chromatin is organized to prohibit the reversal of the developmental program remains unclear. Specifically, the totipotency-to-pluripotency transition marks one of the most dramatic events to the chromatin, and yet, the nature of histone alterations underlying this process is incompletely characterized. Here, we show that linker histone H1 is post-translationally modulated by SUMO2/3, which facilitates its fixation onto ultra-condensed heterochromatin in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Upon SUMOylation depletion, the chromatin becomes de-compacted and H1 is evicted, leading to totipotency reactivation. Furthermore, we show that H1 and SUMO2/3 jointly mediate the repression of totipotent elements. Lastly, we demonstrate that preventing SUMOylation on H1 abrogates its ability to repress the totipotency program in ESCs. Collectively, our findings unravel a critical role for SUMOylation of H1 in facilitating chromatin repression and desolation of the totipotent identity.

Abstract: Summary
In all eutherian mammals, growth of the fetus is dependent upon a functional placenta, but whether and how the latter adapts to putative fetal signals is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate, through fetal, endothelial, hematopoietic, and trophoblast-specific genetic manipulations in the mouse, that endothelial and fetus-derived IGF2 is required for the continuous expansion of the feto-placental microvasculature in late pregnancy. The angiocrine effects of IGF2 on placental microvasculature expansion are mediated, in part, through IGF2R and angiopoietin-Tie2/TEK signaling. Additionally, IGF2 exerts IGF2R-ERK1/2-dependent pro-proliferative and angiogenic effects on primary feto-placental endothelial cells ex vivo. Endothelial and fetus-derived IGF2 also plays an important role in trophoblast morphogenesis, acting through Gcm1 and Synb. Thus, our study reveals a direct role for the imprinted Igf2-Igf2r axis on matching placental development to fetal growth and establishes the principle that hormone-like signals from the fetus play important roles in controlling placental microvasculature and trophoblast morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The state of immune activation may guide targeted immunotherapy in sepsis. In a double-blind, double-dummy randomized clinical study, 240 patients with sepsis due to lung infection, bacteremia, or acute cholangitis were subjected to measurements of serum ferritin and HLA-DR/CD14. Patients with macrophage activation-like syndrome (MALS) or immunoparalysis were randomized to treatment with anakinra or recombinant interferon-gamma or placebo. Twenty-eight-day mortality was the primary endpoint; sepsis immune classification was the secondary endpoint. Using ferritin >4,420 ng/mL and <5,000 HLA-DR receptors/monocytes as biomarkers, patients were classified into MALS (20.0%), immunoparalysis (42.9%), and intermediate (37.1%). Mortality was 79.1%, 66.9%, and 41.6%, respectively. Survival after 7 days with SOFA score decrease was achieved in 42.9% of patients of the immunotherapy arm and 10.0% of the placebo arm (p = 0.042). Three independent immune classification strata are recognized in sepsis. MALS and immunoparalysis are proposed as stratification for personalized adjuvant immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid, global dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of a diverse range of variants. Here, we describe how the mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has shaped HLA-restricted T cell immunity at the population level during the first year of the pandemic. We analyzed a total of 330,246 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies, sampled across 143 countries and all major continents from December 2019 to December 2020 before mass vaccination or the rise of the Delta variant. We observed that proline residues are preferentially removed from the proteome of prevalent mutants, leading to a predicted global loss of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes in individuals expressing HLA-B alleles of the B7 supertype family; this is largely driven by a dominant C-to-U mutation type at the RNA level. These results indicate that B7-supertype-associated epitopes, including the most immunodominant ones, were more likely to escape CD8+ T cell immunosurveillance during the first year of the pandemic.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant overexpression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) has been reported in a variety of tumor cells and is a poor prognosis factor for patient survival. It plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation, acting concurrently as an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthase and, unexpectedly, as an extracellular signaling molecule for several tumor-promoting pathways. Although previous efforts to modulate NAMPT activity were limited to enzymatic inhibitors with low success in clinical studies, protein degradation offers the possibility to simultaneously disrupt NAMPT’s enzyme activity and ligand capabilities. Here we report the development of two highly selective proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that promote NAMPT degradation in a cereblon-dependent manner. Both PROTAC degraders outperform a clinical candidate, FK866, in killing effect on hematological tumor cells. These results emphasize the importance and feasibility of applying PROTACs as a superior strategy for targeting proteins with multiple tumor-promoting functions like NAMPT, which is not easily achieved by conventional enzymatic inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
RNA granules are cytoplasmic condensates that organize biochemical and signaling complexes in response to cellular stress. Functional proteomic investigations under RNA-granule-inducing conditions are needed to identify protein sites involved in coupling stress response with ribonucleoprotein regulation. Here, we apply chemical proteomics using sulfonyl-triazole (SuTEx) probes to capture cellular responses to oxidative and nutrient stress. The stress-responsive tyrosine and lysine sites detected mapped to known proteins involved in processing body (PB) and stress granule (SG) pathways, including LSM14A, FUS, and Enhancer of mRNA-decapping protein 3 (EDC3). Notably, disruption of EDC3 tyrosine 475 (Y475) resulted in hypo-phosphorylation at S161 and S131 and altered protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with decapping complex components (DDX6, DCP1A/B) and 14-3-3 proteins. This resulting mutant form of EDC3 was capable of rescuing the PB-deficient phenotype of EDC3 knockout cells. Taken together, our findings identify Y475 as an arsenic-responsive site that regulates RNA granule formation by coupling EDC3 post-translational modification and PPI states.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the organization of the cell cycle has been a longstanding goal in cell biology. We combined time-lapse microscopy, highly multiplexed single-cell imaging of 48 core cell cycle proteins, and manifold learning to render a visualization of the human cell cycle. This data-driven approach revealed the comprehensive “structure” of the cell cycle: a continuum of molecular states that cells occupy as they transition from one cell division to the next, or as they enter or exit cell cycle arrest. Paradoxically, progression deeper into cell cycle arrest was accompanied by increases in proliferative effectors such as CDKs and cyclins, which can drive cell cycle re-entry by overcoming p21 induction. The structure also revealed the molecular trajectories into senescence and the unique combination of molecular features that define this irreversibly arrested state. This approach will enable the comparison of alternative cell cycles during development, in response to environmental perturbation and in disease. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: The metamorphosis of flatfish is unique, especially its eye migration. Autophagy has been found to be involved in a variety of organisms’ metamorphosis. In order to explore the relationship between autophagy and flatfish metamorphosis, we investigated the expression of autophagy marker gene lc3b during the metamorphosis using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ RNA hybridization. Besides, we inhibited cell division, which was reported as the force source of eye migration, and autophagy around the mobile eye by microinjecting the inhibitors to explore the effects on autophagy expression and eye migration. We found that autophagy taking place during the metamorphosis, particularly in the areas around the eyes. In addition, the eye migration could be blocked by inhibiting the autophagy in the supraorbital area of the blind side, and after we blocked the eye migration by inhibiting cell proliferation in the infraorbital area of the blind side, the autophagy around the eye was partially inhibited. These findings indicate that the autophagy around the eyes caused by eye migration. Moreover, the cell death caused by autophagy loosen the orbital tissue to create space for the eye migration.

Abstract: In some lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) cholesterol accumulates in vesicles. Whether increased vesicle cholesterol affects vesicle fusion with the plasmalemma, where the fusion pore, a channel between the vesicle lumen and the extracellular space, is formed, is unknown. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that after stimulation of exocytosis, pituitary lactotroph vesicles discharge cholesterol which transfers to the plasmalemma. Cholesterol depletion in lactotrophs and astrocytes, both exhibiting Ca2+-dependent exocytosis regulated by distinct Ca2+sources, evokes vesicle secretion. Although this treatment enhanced cytosolic levels of Ca2+ in lactotrophs but decreased it in astrocytes, this indicates that cholesterol may well directly define the fusion pore. In an attempt to explain this mechanism, a new model of cholesterol-dependent fusion pore regulation is proposed. High-resolution membrane capacitance measurements, used to monitor fusion pore conductance, a parameter related to fusion pore diameter, confirm that at resting conditions reducing cholesterol increases, while enrichment with cholesterol decreases the conductance of the fusion pore. In resting fibroblasts, lacking the Npc1 protein, a cellular model of LSD in which cholesterol accumulates in vesicles, the fusion pore conductance is smaller than in controls, showing that vesicle cholesterol controls fusion pore and is relevant for pathophysiology of LSD.

Abstract: The Janus kinases–signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling pathway are a pleiotropic cascade that involves ligands such as cytokines, hormones, and growth factors. Among cytokines, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22, IL-23, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha play a pivotal role in psoriasis. We aimed at investigating in an organotypic experimental model of normal human skin (n = 7 women between 20–40 years old, non-smokers) the early, direct, and specific effects of IL-17, IL-22, IL-23, TNF-alpha and a combination of the four cytokines (Mix) on the JAK-STAT/pathway. The expression of the psoriatic marker keratin (K) 17 was analyzed by immunofluorescence and molecular techniques after exposure to IL-23 or Mix. The Mix elicited a strong K17 up-regulation in keratinocytes at 72 h, reinforcing the hypothesis of a synergistic effect of different cytokines. High levels of JAK1 and STAT3 activation were detected, suggesting the involvement of JAK1/STAT3 pathway in the upregulation of K17. As the present study in an organotypic model of human skin reports a variable expression of JAK-STAT upon different cytokine stimuli and most of the JAK inhibitors for the psoriasis treatment have proven to have a clinical efficacy, these observations have a relevance to better understand the mechanisms of JAK-inhibitors in the skin.

Abstract: Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-Exos) were reported to have therapeutic potential in degenerative diseases. This study aimed to explore the effects of BMSC-Exos on inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization, reducing excessive nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) apoptosis, and inhibiting ECM degradation during intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Rat IDD models were established by acupuncture. For the co-culture experiment, we used BMSC-Exo or human monocyte leukemia (THP-1) medium to incubate THP-1 or NPCs, respectively. BMSC-Exo was isolated from the BMSC medium, identified by TEM and NTA, and injected into the intervertebral discs of IDD rats. The macrophage infiltration in intervertebral disc tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. ELISA was used to measure the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10. The ECM degradation was analyzed by Western blot. The cell proportion and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. The morphological change of the intervertebral disc was analyzed by HE and safranin O fixation staining. In intervertebral disc tissues of IDD rats, we found the increased infiltration of M1 macrophages, with upregulated iNOS, TNF-α and IL-6 levels. Compared with BMSCs, the expression of CAHM in BMSC-Exo was significantly higher. Using co-cultured experiments, we proved that BMSC-Exo reduced apoptosis and ECM degradation of NPCs by inhibiting M1-type macrophage polarization by delivering CAHM. In addition, BMSC-Exo could improve IDD in vivo, including increased proteoglycan content, reduced macrophage infiltration and ECM degradation, and decrease expression of inflammatory factors by delivering CAHM. In conclusion, BMSC-Exo delivered exogenous CAHM via exosomes to regulate macrophage polarization and ameliorate IDD.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas transcriptional circuits hold great promise as platforms for engineering metabolic networks and information processing circuits. Historically, prokaryotic CRISPR control systems have been limited to CRISPRi. Creating approaches to integrate CRISPRa for transcriptional activation with existing CRISPRi-based systems would greatly expand CRISPR circuit design space. Here, we develop design principles for engineering prokaryotic CRISPRa/i genetic circuits with network topologies specified by guide RNAs. We demonstrate that multi-layer CRISPRa/i cascades and feedforward loops can operate through the regulated expression of guide RNAs in cell-free expression systems and E. coli. We show that CRISPRa/i circuits can program complex functions by designing type 1 incoherent feedforward loops acting as fold-change detectors and tunable pulse-generators. By investigating how component characteristics relate to network properties such as depth, width, and speed, this work establishes a framework for building scalable CRISPRa/i circuits as regulatory programs in cell-free expression systems and bacterial hosts. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.
