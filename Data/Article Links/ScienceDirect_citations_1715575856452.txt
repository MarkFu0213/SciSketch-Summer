Abstract: Summary
Heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in SETD1A, which encodes a subunit of histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome and increase the risk for schizophrenia. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generate excitatory/inhibitory neuronal networks from human induced pluripotent stem cells with a SETD1A heterozygous LoF mutation (SETD1A+/−). Our data show that SETD1A haploinsufficiency results in morphologically increased dendritic complexity and functionally increased bursting activity. This network phenotype is primarily driven by SETD1A haploinsufficiency in glutamatergic neurons. In accordance with the functional changes, transcriptomic profiling reveals perturbations in gene sets associated with glutamatergic synaptic function. At the molecular level, we identify specific changes in the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/Protein Kinase A pathway pointing toward a hyperactive cAMP pathway in SETD1A+/− neurons. Finally, by pharmacologically targeting the cAMP pathway, we are able to rescue the network deficits in SETD1A+/− cultures. Our results demonstrate a link between SETD1A and the cAMP-dependent pathway in human neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Saliva from mosquitoes contains vasodilators that antagonize vasoconstrictors produced at the bite site. Sialokinin is a vasodilator present in the saliva of Aedes aegypti. Here, we investigate its function and describe its mechanism of action during blood feeding. Sialokinin induces nitric oxide release similar to substance P. Sialokinin-KO mosquitoes produce lower blood perfusion than parental mosquitoes at the bite site during probing and have significantly longer probing times, which result in lower blood feeding success. In contrast, there is no difference in feeding between KO and parental mosquitoes when using artificial membrane feeders or mice that are treated with a substance P receptor antagonist, confirming that sialokinin interferes with host hemostasis via NK1R signaling. While sialokinin-KO saliva does not affect virus infection in vitro, it stimulates macrophages and inhibits leukocyte recruitment in vivo. This work highlights the biological functionality of salivary proteins in blood feeding.

Abstract: Summary
Amyloids are fibrous protein aggregates associated with age-related diseases. While these aggregates are typically described as irreversible and pathogenic, some cells use reversible amyloid-like structures that serve important functions. The RNA-binding protein Rim4 forms amyloid-like assemblies that are essential for translational control during Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis. Rim4 amyloid-like assemblies are disassembled in a phosphorylation-dependent manner at meiosis II onset. By investigating Rim4 clearance, we elucidate co-factors that mediate clearance of amyloid-like assemblies in a physiological setting. We demonstrate that yeast 14-3-3 proteins bind to Rim4 assemblies and facilitate their subsequent phosphorylation and timely clearance. Furthermore, distinct 14-3-3 proteins play non-redundant roles in facilitating phosphorylation and clearance of amyloid-like Rim4. Additionally, we find that 14-3-3 proteins contribute to global protein aggregate homeostasis. Based on the role of 14-3-3 proteins in aggregate homeostasis and their interactions with disease-associated assemblies, we propose that these proteins may protect against pathological protein aggregates.

Abstract: Summary
Previously, we showed that CDYL1 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to promote homologous recombination (HR) repair and foster transcriptional silencing. However, how CDYL1 elicits DSB-induced silencing is not fully understood. Here, we identify a CDYL1-dependent local decrease in the transcriptionally active marks histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) and crotonylated lysine 9 of H3 (H3K9cr) at AsiSI-induced DSBs, which correlates with transcriptional silencing. Mechanistically, we reveal that CDYL1 crotonyl-CoA hydratase activity counteracts Kcr and H3K9cr at DSB sites, which triggers the eviction of the transcription elongation factor ENL and fosters transcriptional silencing. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of CDYL1 hydratase activity blocks the reduction in H3K9cr and alleviates DSB-induced silencing, whereas HR efficiency unexpectedly remains intact. Therefore, our results functionally uncouple the repair and silencing activity of CDYL1 at DSBs. In a broader context, we address a long-standing question concerning the functional relationship between HR repair and DSB-induced silencing, suggesting that they may occur independently.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains a rich source of nutrients that sustains cell growth and facilitate tumor development. Glucose and glutamine in the TME are essential for the development and activation of effector T cells that exert antitumor function. Immunotherapy unleashes T cell antitumor function, and although many solid tumors respond well, a significant proportion of patients do not benefit. In patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, KEAP1 and STK11/Lkb1 co-mutations are associated with impaired response to immunotherapy. To investigate the metabolic and immune microenvironment of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, we generated murine models that reflect the KEAP1 and STK11/Lkb1 mutational landscape in these patients. Here, we show increased glutamate abundance in the Lkb1-deficient TME associated with CD8 T cell activation in response to anti-PD1. Combination treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 inhibited clonal expansion and activation of CD8 T cells. Thus, glutaminase inhibition negatively impacts CD8 T cells activated by anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Although the antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination has been studied extensively at the polyclonal level using immune sera, little has been reported on the antibody response at the monoclonal level. Here, we isolate a panel of 44 anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from an individual who received two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine at a 12-week interval. We show that, despite a relatively low serum neutralization titer, Spike-reactive IgG+ B cells are still detectable 9 months post-boost. Furthermore, mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Gamma, Beta, Delta, and Omicron) are present. The vaccine-elicited neutralizing mAbs form eight distinct competition groups and bind epitopes overlapping with neutralizing mAbs elicited following SARS-CoV-2 infection. AZD1222-elicited mAbs are more mutated than mAbs isolated from convalescent donors 1–2 months post-infection. These findings provide molecular insights into the AZD1222 vaccine-elicited antibody response.

Abstract: Summary
Disruption of antagonism between SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and polycomb repressor complexes drives the formation of numerous cancer types. Recently, an inhibitor of the polycomb protein EZH2 was approved for the treatment of a sarcoma mutant in the SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1, but resistance occurs. Here, we performed CRISPR screens in SMARCB1-mutant rhabdoid tumor cells to identify genetic contributors to SWI/SNF-polycomb antagonism and potential resistance mechanisms. We found that loss of the H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1 caused resistance to EZH2 inhibition. We show that NSD1 antagonizes polycomb via cooperation with SWI/SNF and identify co-occurrence of NSD1 inactivation in SWI/SNF-defective cancers, indicating in vivo relevance. We demonstrate that H3K36me2 itself has an essential role in the activation of polycomb target genes as inhibition of the H3K36me2 demethylase KDM2A restores the efficacy of EZH2 inhibition in SWI/SNF-deficient cells lacking NSD1. Together our data expand the mechanistic understanding of SWI/SNF and polycomb interplay and identify NSD1 as the key for coordinating this transcriptional control.

Abstract: Summary
T cell exhaustion is a major impediment to antitumor immunity. However, it remains elusive how other immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to this dysfunctional state. Here, we show that the biology of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and exhausted T cells (Tex) in the TME is extensively linked. We demonstrate that in vivo depletion of TAMs reduces exhaustion programs in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and reinvigorates their effector potential. Reciprocally, transcriptional and epigenetic profiling reveals that Tex express factors that actively recruit monocytes to the TME and shape their differentiation. Using lattice light sheet microscopy, we show that TAM and CD8+ T cells engage in unique, long-lasting, antigen-specific synaptic interactions that fail to activate T cells but prime them for exhaustion, which is then accelerated in hypoxic conditions. Spatially resolved sequencing supports a spatiotemporal self-enforcing positive feedback circuit that is aligned to protect rather than destroy a tumor.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila has long been a successful model organism in multiple biomedical fields. Spatial gene expression patterns are critical for the understanding of complex pathways and interactions, whereas temporal gene expression changes are vital for studying highly dynamic physiological activities. Systematic studies in Drosophila are still impeded by the lack of spatiotemporal transcriptomic information. Here, utilizing spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we dissected the spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes of developing Drosophila with high resolution and sensitivity. We demonstrated that Stereo-seq data can be used for the 3D reconstruction of the spatial transcriptomes of Drosophila embryos and larvae. With these 3D models, we identified functional subregions in embryonic and larval midguts, uncovered spatial cell state dynamics of larval testis, and revealed known and potential regulons of transcription factors within their topographic background. Our data provide the Drosophila research community with useful resources of organism-wide spatiotemporally resolved transcriptomic information across developmental stages.

Abstract: Summary
CDC42 family GTPases (RHOJ, RHOQ, CDC42) are upregulated but rarely mutated in cancer and control both the ability of tumor cells to invade surrounding tissues and the ability of endothelial cells to vascularize tumors. Here, we use computer-aided drug design to discover a chemical entity (ARN22089) that has broad activity against a panel of cancer cell lines, inhibits S6 phosphorylation and MAPK activation, activates pro-inflammatory and apoptotic signaling, and blocks tumor growth and angiogenesis in 3D vascularized microtumor models (VMT) in vitro. Additionally, ARN22089 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and can inhibit the growth of BRAF mutant mouse melanomas and patient-derived xenografts in vivo. ARN22089 selectively blocks CDC42 effector interactions without affecting the binding between closely related GTPases and their downstream effectors. Taken together, we identify a class of therapeutic agents that influence tumor growth by modulating CDC42 signaling in both the tumor cell and its microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Cocaine use is a major comorbidity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). In this study, we show that cocaine exposure worsens the learning and memory of doxycycline-inducible and brain-specific HIV Tat transgenic mice (iTat) and results in 14,838 hypermethylated CpG-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 15,800 hypomethylated CpG-related DMRs, which are linked to 52 down- and 127 upregulated genes, respectively, in the hippocampus of iTat mice. These genes are mostly enriched at the neuronal function-, cell morphology-, and synapse formation-related extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor-ligand interaction pathway and mostly impacted in microglia. The accompanying neuropathological changes include swollen dendritic spines, increased synaptophysin expression, and diminished glial activation. We also find that sex (female) and age additively worsen the behavioral and pathological changes. These findings together indicate that chronic cocaine and long-term Tat expression interactively contribute to HAND, likely involving changes of DNA methylation and ECM receptor-ligand interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Mammals differ more than 100-fold in maximum lifespan. Here, we conducted comparative transcriptomics on 26 species with diverse lifespans. We identified thousands of genes with expression levels negatively or positively correlated with a species’ maximum lifespan (Neg- or Pos-MLS genes). Neg-MLS genes are primarily involved in energy metabolism and inflammation. Pos-MLS genes show enrichment in DNA repair, microtubule organization, and RNA transport. Expression of Neg- and Pos-MLS genes is modulated by interventions, including mTOR and PI3K inhibition. Regulatory networks analysis showed that Neg-MLS genes are under circadian regulation possibly to avoid persistent high expression, whereas Pos-MLS genes are targets of master pluripotency regulators OCT4 and NANOG and are upregulated during somatic cell reprogramming. Pos-MLS genes are highly expressed during embryogenesis but significantly downregulated after birth. This work provides targets for anti-aging interventions by defining pathways correlating with longevity across mammals and uncovering circadian and pluripotency networks as central regulators of longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses must effectively remodel host cellular pathways to replicate and evade immune defenses, and they must do so with limited genomic coding capacity. Targeting post-translational modification (PTM) pathways provides a mechanism by which viruses can broadly and rapidly transform a hostile host environment into a hospitable one. We use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify changes in protein abundance and two PTM types—phosphorylation and ubiquitination—in response to HIV-1 infection with viruses harboring targeted deletions of a subset of HIV-1 genes. PTM analysis reveals a requirement for Aurora kinase activity in HIV-1 infection and identified putative substrates of a phosphatase that is degraded during infection. Finally, we demonstrate that the HIV-1 Vpr protein inhibits histone H1 ubiquitination, leading to defects in DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Glycolysis, including both lactate fermentation and pyruvate oxidation, orchestrates CD8+ T cell differentiation. However, how mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism and uptake controlled by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) impact T cell function and fate remains elusive. We found that genetic deletion of MPC drives CD8+ T cell differentiation toward a memory phenotype. Metabolic flexibility induced by MPC inhibition facilitated acetyl-coenzyme-A production by glutamine and fatty acid oxidation that results in enhanced histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility on pro-memory genes. However, in the tumor microenvironment, MPC is essential for sustaining lactate oxidation to support CD8+ T cell antitumor function. We further revealed that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell manufacturing with an MPC inhibitor imprinted a memory phenotype and demonstrated that infusing MPC inhibitor-conditioned CAR T cells resulted in superior and long-lasting antitumor activity. Altogether, we uncover that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake instructs metabolic flexibility for guiding T cell differentiation and antitumor responses.

Abstract: Summary
RNA activation (RNAa) is an uncharacterized mechanism of transcriptional activation mediated by small RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs). A critical issue in RNAa research is that it is difficult to distinguish between changes in gene expression caused indirectly by post-transcriptional regulation and direct induction of gene expression by RNAa. Therefore, in this study, we seek to identify a key factor involved in RNAa, using the induction of ZMYND10 by miR-34a as a system to evaluate RNAa. We identify the positive transcription elongation factors CDK9 and DDX21, which form a complex with nuclear AGO and TNRC6A, as important transcriptional activators of RNAa. In addition, we find that inhibition of DDX21 suppresses RNAa by miR-34a and other miRNAs without inhibiting post-transcriptional regulation. Our findings reveal a strong connection between RNAa and release of paused Pol II, facilitating RNAa research by making it possible to separately analyze post-transcriptional regulation and RNAa.

Abstract: The liver is the predominant metastatic site for pancreatic cancer. However, the factors that determine the liver metastasis and the specific molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we used human pancreatic cancer cell line Hs766T to establish Hs766T-L3, a subline of Hs766T with stable liver metastatic ability. We performed RNA sequencing of Hs766T-L3 and its parental cell line Hs766T, and revealed huge differences in gene expression patterns and pathway activation between these two cell lines. We correlated the difference in pathway activation with the expression of the four core transcriptional factors including STAT1, NR2F2, GATA2, and SMAD4. Using the TCGA database, we examined the relative expression of these transcription factors (TFs) in pan-cancer and their relationship with the prognosis of the pancreatic cancer. Among these TFs, we considered GATA2 is closely involved in tumor metastasis and may serve as a potential metastatic driver. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that GATA2-mediated transcriptional activation of Notch3 promotes the liver metastasis of Hs766T-L3, and knockdown of either GATA2 or Notch3 reduces the metastatic ability of Hs766T-L3. Therefore, we claim that GATA2 may serve as a metastatic driver of pancreatic cancer and a potential therapeutic target to treat liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The switch from mitosis to meiosis ensures the successive formation of gametes. However, it remains unclear how meiotic initiation occurs within the context of chromatin. Recent studies have shown that zinc finger HIT-type containing 1 (Znhit1), a subunit of the SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex, plays essential roles in modulating the chromatin structure. Herein, we report that the germline-conditional deletion of Znhit1 in male mice specifically blocks meiotic initiation. We show that Znhit1 is required for meiotic prophase events, including synapsis, DNA double-strand break formation, and meiotic DNA replication. Mechanistically, Znhit1 controls the histone variant H2A.Z deposition, which facilitates the expression of meiotic genes, such as Meiosin, but not the expression of Stra8. Interestingly, Znhit1 deficiency disrupts the transcription bubbles of meiotic genes. Thus, our findings identify the essential role of Znhit1-dependent H2A.Z deposition in allowing activation of meiotic gene expression, thereby controlling the initiation of meiosis.

Abstract: Summary
Our group has reported previously on the role of various members of the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family, which are involved in epigenetic regulation, in the progression of leukemia. Here, we explored the role of PRMT7, given its unique function within the PRMT family, in the maintenance of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Genetic loss of Prmt7, and the development and testing of a small-molecule specific inhibitor of PRMT7, showed that targeting PRMT7 delayed leukemia development and impaired self-renewal of LSCs in a CML mouse model and in primary CML CD34+ cells from humans without affecting normal hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, loss of PRMT7 resulted in reduced expressions of glycine decarboxylase, leading to the reprograming of glycine metabolism to generate methylglyoxal, which is detrimental to LSCs. These findings link histone arginine methylation with glycine metabolism, while suggesting PRMT7 as a potential therapeutic target for the eradication of LSCs in CML.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the complex functions of plant leaves requires a thorough characterization of discrete cell features. Although single-cell gene expression profiling technologies have been developed, their application in characterizing cell subtypes has not been achieved yet. Here, we present scStereo-seq (single-cell spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing) that enabled us to show the bona fide single-cell spatial transcriptome profiles of Arabidopsis leaves. Subtle but significant transcriptomic differences between upper and lower epidermal cells have been successfully distinguished. Furthermore, we discovered cell-type-specific gene expression gradients from the main vein to the leaf edge, which led to the finding of distinct spatial developmental trajectories of vascular cells and guard cells. Our study showcases the importance of physical locations of individual cells for exerting complex biological functions in plants and demonstrates that scStereo-seq is a powerful tool to integrate single-cell location and transcriptome information for plant biology study.

Abstract: Summary
Noncompaction cardiomyopathy is a common congenital cardiac disorder associated with abnormal ventricular cardiomyocyte trabeculation and impaired pump function. The genetic basis and underlying mechanisms of this disorder remain elusive. We show that the genetic deletion of RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (Rbpms), an uncharacterized RNA-binding factor, causes perinatal lethality in mice due to congenital cardiovascular defects. The loss of Rbpms causes premature onset of cardiomyocyte binucleation and cell cycle arrest during development. Human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with RBPMS gene deletion have a similar blockade to cytokinesis. Sequencing analysis revealed that RBPMS plays a role in RNA splicing and influences RNAs involved in cytoskeletal signaling pathways. We found that RBPMS mediates the isoform switching of the heart-enriched LIM domain protein Pdlim5. The loss of Rbpms leads to an abnormal accumulation of Pdlim5-short isoforms, disrupting cardiomyocyte cytokinesis. Our findings connect premature cardiomyocyte binucleation to noncompaction cardiomyopathy and highlight the role of RBPMS in this process.

Abstract: Summary
Loss- or gain-of-function mutations in ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K-ATP)-encoding genes, KCNJ8 and ABCC9, cause human central nervous system disorders with unknown pathogenesis. Here, using mice, zebrafish, and cell culture models, we investigated cellular and molecular causes of brain dysfunctions derived from altered K-ATP channel function. We show that genetic/chemical inhibition or activation of KCNJ8/ABCC9-containing K-ATP channel function leads to brain-selective suppression or promotion of arterial/arteriolar vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation, respectively. We further show that brain VSMCs develop from KCNJ8/ABCC9-containing K-ATP channel-expressing mural cell progenitor and that K-ATP channel cell autonomously regulates VSMC differentiation through modulation of intracellular Ca2+ oscillation via voltage-dependent calcium channels. Consistent with defective VSMC development, Kcnj8 knockout mice showed deficiency in vasoconstrictive capacity and neuronal-evoked vasodilation leading to local hyperemia. Our results demonstrate a role for KCNJ8/ABCC9-containing K-ATP channels in the differentiation of brain VSMC, which in turn is necessary for fine-tuning of cerebral blood flow.

Abstract: Summary
T follicular helper (TFH) cells promote expansion of germinal center (GC) B cells and plasma cell differentiation. Whether cognate peptide-MHCII (pMHCII) density instructs selection and cell fate decisions in a quantitative manner remains unclear. Using αDEC205-OVA to differentially deliver OVA peptides to GC B cells on the basis of DEC205 allelic copy number, we find DEC205+/+ B cells take up 2-fold more antigen than DEC205+/− cells, leading to proportional TFH cell help and B cell expansion. To validate these results, we establish a caged OVA peptide, which is readily detected by OVA-specific TFH cells after photo-uncaging. In situ uncaging of peptides leads to multiple serial B-T contacts and cell activation. Differential CD40 signaling, is both necessary and sufficient to mediate 2-fold differences in B cell expansion. While plasmablast numbers are increased, pMHCII density does not directly control the output or quality of plasma cells. Thus, we distinguish the roles TFH cells play in expansion versus differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) is a kidney-specific Ca2+-selective ion channel that plays a key role in Ca2+ homeostasis. The basal activity of TRPV5 is balanced through activation by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and inhibition by Ca2+-bound calmodulin (CaM). Parathyroid hormone (PTH), the key extrinsic regulator of Ca2+ homeostasis, increases the activity of TRPV5 via protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation. Metabolic acidosis leads to reduced TRPV5 activity independent of PTH, causing hypercalciuria. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that low pH inhibits TRPV5 by precluding PI(4,5)P2 activation. We capture intermediate conformations at low pH, revealing a transition from open to closed state. In addition, we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 is the primary modulator of channel gating, yet PKA controls TRPV5 activity by preventing CaM binding and channel inactivation. Our data provide detailed molecular mechanisms for regulation of TRPV5 by two key extrinsic modulators, low pH and PKA.

Abstract: Summary
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) establishes a latent infection in the cell nucleus, but where KSHV episomal genomes are tethered and the mechanisms underlying KSHV lytic reactivation are unclear. Here, we study the nuclear microenvironment of KSHV episomes and show that the KSHV latency-lytic replication switch is regulated via viral long non-coding (lnc)RNA-CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4) interaction. KSHV episomes localize with CHD4 and ADNP proteins, components of the cellular ChAHP complex. The CHD4 and ADNP proteins occupy the 5′-region of the highly inducible lncRNAs and terminal repeats of the KSHV genome together with latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Viral lncRNA binding competes with CHD4 DNA binding, and KSHV reactivation sequesters CHD4 from the KSHV genome, which is also accompanied by detachment of KSHV episomes from host chromosome docking sites. We propose a model in which robust KSHV lncRNA expression determines the latency-lytic decision by regulating LANA/CHD4 binding to KSHV episomes.

Abstract: Summary
Regulated loading of eIF3-bound 40S ribosomes on capped mRNA is generally dependent upon the translation initiation factor eIF4E; however, mRNA translation often proceeds during physiological stress, such as virus infection, when eIF4E availability and activity are limiting. It remains poorly understood how translation of virus and host mRNAs are regulated during infection stress. While initially sensitive to mTOR inhibition, which limits eIF4E-dependent translation, we show that protein synthesis in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-infected cells unexpectedly becomes progressively reliant upon eIF3d. Targeting eIF3d selectively inhibits HCMV replication, reduces polyribosome abundance, and interferes with expression of essential virus genes and a host gene expression signature indicative of chronic ER stress that fosters HCMV reproduction. This reveals a strategy whereby cellular eIF3d-dependent protein production is hijacked to exploit virus-induced ER stress. Moreover, it establishes how switching between eIF4E and eIF3d-responsive cap-dependent translation can differentially tune virus and host gene expression in infected cells.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) when administered early. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have negatively affected therapeutic use of some authorized mAbs. Using a high-throughput B cell screening pipeline, we isolated LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab), a highly potent SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody. LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2. In pseudovirus neutralization studies, LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes variants, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, B.1.427/B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, B.1.1.529, and the BA.2 subvariant. Structural analysis reveals that the contact residues of the LY-CoV1404 epitope are highly conserved, except for N439 and N501. The binding and neutralizing activity of LY-CoV1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y). The broad and potent neutralization activity and the relatively conserved epitope suggest that LY-CoV1404 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat all known variants.

Abstract: Summary
The dilemma of how to categorize and classify diseases has been debated for centuries. The field of medical genetics has historically approached nosology based on clinical phenotypes observed in patients and families. Advances in genomic sequencing and understanding of genetic contributions to disease often provoke a need to reassess these classifications. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has developed frameworks to classify the strength of evidence underlying monogenic gene-disease relationships, variant pathogenicity, and clinical actionability. It is therefore necessary to define the disease entity being evaluated, which can be challenging for genes associated with multiple conditions and/or a broad phenotypic spectrum. We therefore developed criteria to guide “lumping and splitting” decisions and improve consistency in defining monogenic gene-disease relationships. Here, we outline the precuration process, the lumping and splitting guidelines with examples, and describe the implications for clinical diagnosis, informatics, and care management.

Abstract: Summary
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) frequently possess immense mutational burdens; however, the functional significance of most of these mutations remains unclear. Here, we report that loss of Ptch1, the most common mutation that activates upstream Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, initiates the formation of nascent BCC-like tumors that eventually enter into a dormant state. However, rare tumors that overcome dormancy acquire the ability to hyperactivate downstream Hh signaling through a variety of mechanisms, including amplification of Gli1/2 and upregulation of Mycn. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MYCN overexpression promotes the progression of tumors induced by loss of Ptch1. These findings suggest that canonical mutations that activate upstream Hh signaling are necessary, but not sufficient, for BCC to fully progress. Rather, tumors likely acquire secondary mutations that further hyperactivate downstream Hh signaling in order to escape dormancy and enter a trajectory of uncontrolled expansion.

Abstract: Summary
Animal density-dependent experiences have profound effects on reproductive strategies with marked fecundity differences. Migratory locust adopts distinct population density-dependent reproductive strategies to cope with their respective life cycles, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report that Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in the locust germline play key roles in this process. We find that the locust Piwi protein Liwi1 and piRNAs are highly expressed in early developing egg chambers in solitarious locusts, which have higher fecundity than gregarious locusts. Approximately 40% of solitarious locust-associated piRNAs map to protein-coding genes. We find that Liwi1/piRNAs facilitate pre-mRNA splicing of oocyte development-related genes, such as oo18 RNA-binding protein (Orb), in the germline by recruiting the splicing factor U2AF35 to piRNA-targeted introns, thereby increasing fecundity. Such piRNA-guided pre-mRNA splicing is also functional in Drosophila and mouse germ cells. We uncover a piRNA-guided splicing mechanism for processing reproduction-related mRNAs and determining animal reproductive strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Knowledge on the population history of endangered species is critical for conservation, but whole-genome data on chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) is geographically sparse. Here, we produced the first non-invasive geolocalized catalog of genomic diversity by capturing chromosome 21 from 828 non-invasive samples collected at 48 sampling sites across Africa. The four recognized subspecies show clear genetic differentiation correlating with known barriers, while previously undescribed genetic exchange suggests that these have been permeable on a local scale. We obtained a detailed reconstruction of population stratification and fine-scale patterns of isolation, migration, and connectivity, including a comprehensive picture of admixture with bonobos (Pan paniscus). Unlike humans, chimpanzees did not experience extended episodes of long-distance migrations, which might have limited cultural transmission. Finally, based on local rare variation, we implement a fine-grained geolocalization approach demonstrating improved precision in determining the origin of confiscated chimpanzees.

Abstract: Summary
Genome in a Bottle benchmarks are widely used to help validate clinical sequencing pipelines and develop variant calling and sequencing methods. Here we use accurate linked and long reads to expand benchmarks in 7 samples to include difficult-to-map regions and segmental duplications that are challenging for short reads. These benchmarks add more than 300,000 SNVs and 50,000 insertions or deletions (indels) and include 16% more exonic variants, many in challenging, clinically relevant genes not covered previously, such as PMS2. For HG002, we include 92% of the autosomal GRCh38 assembly while excluding regions problematic for benchmarking small variants, such as copy number variants, that should not have been in the previous version, which included 85% of GRCh38. It identifies eight times more false negatives in a short read variant call set relative to our previous benchmark. We demonstrate that this benchmark reliably identifies false positives and false negatives across technologies, enabling ongoing methods development.

Abstract: Summary
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetic disorder that affects primary cilia. BBSome, a protein complex composed of eight BBS proteins, regulates the structure and function of cilia, and its malfunction causes BBS in humans. Here, we report a cilia-independent function of BBSome. To identify genes that regulate the C. elegans photoreceptor protein LITE-1 in ciliated ASH photosensory neurons, we performed a genetic screen and isolated bbs mutants. Functional analysis revealed that BBSome regulates LITE-1 protein stability independently of cilia. Through another round of genetic screening, we found that this cilia-independent function of BBSome is mediated by DLK-MAPK signaling, which acts downstream of BBSome to control LITE-1 stability via Rab5-mediated endocytosis. BBSome exerts its function by regulating the expression of DLK. BBSome also regulates the expression of LZK, a mammalian DLK in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains transcriptionally silent genes in a repressed state via deposition of histone H3K27-trimethyl (me3) marks. PRC2 has also been implicated in silencing transposable elements (TEs), yet how PRC2 is targeted to TEs remains unclear. To address this question, we identified proteins that physically interact with the Paramecium enhancer-of-zeste Ezl1 enzyme, which catalyzes H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 deposition at TEs. We show that the Paramecium PRC2 core complex comprises four subunits, each required in vivo for catalytic activity. We also identify PRC2 cofactors, including the RNA interference (RNAi) effector Ptiwi09, which are necessary to target H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 to TEs. We find that the physical interaction between PRC2 and the RNAi pathway is mediated by a RING finger protein and that small RNA recruitment of PRC2 to TEs is analogous to the small RNA recruitment of H3K9 methylation SU(VAR)3–9 enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
Convergent extension (CE) is an evolutionarily conserved collective cell movement that elongates several organ systems during development. Studies have revealed two distinct cellular mechanisms, one based on cell crawling and the other on junction contraction. Whether these two behaviors collaborate is unclear. Here, using live-cell imaging, we show that crawling and contraction act both independently and jointly but that CE is more effective when they are integrated via mechano-reciprocity. We thus developed a computational model considering both crawling and contraction. This model recapitulates the biomechanical efficacy of integrating the two modes and further clarifies how the two modes and their integration are influenced by cell adhesion. Finally, we use these insights to understand the function of an understudied catenin, Arvcf, during CE. These data are significant for providing interesting biomechanical and cell biological insights into a fundamental morphogenetic process that is implicated in human neural tube defects and skeletal dysplasias.

Abstract: Summary
Virus infection modulates both host immunity and host genomic stability. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a key nuclear sensor of DNA damage, which maintains genomic integrity, and the successful application of PARP1 inhibitors for clinical anti-cancer therapy has lasted for decades. However, precisely how PARP1 gains access to cytoplasm and regulates antiviral immunity remains unknown. Here, we report that DNA virus induces a reactive nitrogen species (RNS)-dependent DNA damage and activates DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Activated DNA-PK phosphorylates PARP1 on Thr594, thus facilitating the cytoplasmic translocation of PARP1 to inhibit the antiviral immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, cytoplasmic PARP1 interacts with and directly PARylates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) on Asp191 to inhibit its DNA-binding ability. Together, our findings uncover an essential role of PARP1 in linking virus-induced genome instability with inhibition of host immunity, which is of relevance to cancer, autoinflammation, and other diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The efficiency of homologous recombination (HR) in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is closely associated with genome stability and tumor response to chemotherapy. While many factors have been functionally characterized in HR, such as TOPBP1, their precise regulation remains unclear. Here, we report that TOPBP1 interacts with the RNA-binding protein HTATSF1 in a cell-cycle- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. Mechanistically, CK2 phosphorylates HTATSF1 to facilitate binding to TOPBP1, which promotes S-phase-specific TOPBP1 recruitment to damaged chromatin and subsequent RPA/RAD51-dependent HR, genome integrity, and cancer-cell viability. The localization of HTATSF1-TOPBP1 to DSBs is potentially independent of the transcription-coupled RNA-binding and processing capacity of HTATSF1 but rather relies on the recognition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated RPA by HTATSF1, which can be blunted with PARP inhibitors. Together, our study provides a mechanistic insight into TOPBP1 loading at HR-prone DSB sites via HTATSF1 and reveals how RPA-RAD51 exchange is tuned by a PARylation-phosphorylation cascade.

Abstract: Summary
The human immunological mechanisms defining the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain elusive. This knowledge gap is mostly driven by the lack of appropriate experimental platforms recapitulating human immune responses in a controlled human lung environment. Here, we report a mouse model (i.e., HNFL mice) co-engrafted with human fetal lung xenografts (fLX) and a myeloid-enhanced human immune system to identify cellular and molecular correlates of lung protection during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike mice solely engrafted with human fLX, HNFL mice are protected against infection, severe inflammation, and histopathological phenotypes. Lung tissue protection from infection and severe histopathology associates with macrophage infiltration and differentiation and the upregulation of a macrophage-enriched signature composed of 11 specific genes mainly associated with the type I interferon signaling pathway. Our work highlights the HNFL model as a transformative platform to investigate, in controlled experimental settings, human myeloid immune mechanisms governing lung tissue protection during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical processing of task-relevant information enables recognition of behaviorally meaningful sensory events. It is unclear how task-related information is represented within cortical networks by the activity of individual neurons and their functional interactions. Here, we use two-photon imaging to record neuronal activity from the primary auditory cortex of mice during a pure-tone discrimination task. We find that a subset of neurons transiently encode sensory information used to inform behavioral choice. Using Granger causality analysis, we show that these neurons form functional networks in which information transmits sequentially. Network structures differ for target versus non-target tones, encode behavioral choice, and differ between correct versus incorrect behavioral choices. Correct behavioral choices are associated with shorter communication timescales, larger functional correlations, and greater information redundancy. In summary, specialized neurons in primary auditory cortex integrate task-related information and form functional networks whose structures encode both sensory input and behavioral choice.

Abstract: Summary
The pathological and immune response of individuals with COVID-19 display different dynamics in lung and intestine. Here, we depict the single-cell transcriptional atlas of longitudinally collected lung and intestinal tissue samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys at 3 to 10 dpi. We find that intestinal enterocytes are degraded at 3 days post-infection but recovered rapidly, revealing that infection has mild effects on the intestine. Crucially, we observe suppression of the inflammatory response and tissue damage related to B-cell and Paneth cell accumulation in the intestines, although T cells are activated in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with that in the lung, the expression of interferon response-related genes is inhibited, and inflammatory factor secretion is reduced in the intestines. Our findings indicate an imbalance of immune dynamic in intestinal mucosa during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may underlie ongoing rectal viral shedding and mild tissue damage.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are arthropod-borne pathogenic flaviviruses that co-circulate in many countries. To understand some of the pressures that influence ZIKV evolution, we mimic the natural transmission cycle by repeating serial passaging of ZIKV through cultured mosquito cells and either DENV-naive or DENV-immune mice. Compared with wild-type ZIKV, the strains passaged under both conditions exhibit increased pathogenesis in DENV-immune mice. Application of reverse genetics identifies an isoleucine-to-valine mutation (I39V) in the NS2B proteins of both passaged strains that confers enhanced fitness and escape from pre-existing DENV immunity. Introduction of I39V or I39T, a naturally occurring homologous mutation detected in recent ZIKV isolates, increases the replication of wild-type ZIKV in human neuronal precursor cells and laboratory-raised mosquitoes. Our data indicate that ZIKV strains with enhanced transmissibility and pathogenicity can emerge in DENV-naive or -immune settings, and that NS2B-I39 mutants may represent ZIKV variants of interest.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomopathies constitute a range of disorders associated with defective protein synthesis mainly affecting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and erythroid development. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of poly-pyrimidine-tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in the hematopoietic compartment leads to the development of a ribosomopathy-like condition. Specifically, loss of PTBP1 is associated with decreases in HSC self-renewal, erythroid differentiation, and protein synthesis. Consistent with its function as a splicing regulator, PTBP1 deficiency results in splicing defects in hundreds of genes, and we demonstrate that the up-regulation of a specific isoform of CDC42 partly mimics the protein-synthesis defect associated with loss of PTBP1. Furthermore, PTBP1 deficiency is associated with a marked defect in ribosome biogenesis and a selective reduction in the translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins. Collectively, this work identifies PTBP1 as a key integrator of ribosomal functions and highlights the broad functional repertoire of RNA-binding proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The clinical (re)development of bacteriophage (phage) therapy to treat antibiotic-resistant infections faces the challenge of understanding the dynamics of phage-bacteria interactions in the in vivo context. Here, we develop a general strategy coupling in vitro and in vivo experiments with a mathematical model to characterize the interplay between phage and bacteria during pneumonia induced by a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. The model allows the estimation of several key parameters for phage therapeutic efficacy. In particular, it quantifies the impact of dose and route of phage administration as well as the synergism of phage and the innate immune response on bacterial clearance. Simulations predict a limited impact of the intrinsic phage characteristics in agreement with the current semi-empirical choices of phages for compassionate treatments. Model-based approaches will foster the deployment of future phage-therapy clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and frequent progression to leukemia. It has long remained unresolved how MDS cells, which are less proliferative, inhibit normal hematopoiesis and eventually dominate the bone marrow space. Despite several studies implicating mesenchymal stromal or stem cells (MSCs), a principal component of the HSC niche, in the inhibition of normal hematopoiesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that both human and mouse MDS cells perturb bone metabolism by suppressing the osteolineage differentiation of MSCs, which impairs the ability of MSCs to support normal HSCs. Enforced MSC differentiation rescues the suppressed normal hematopoiesis in both in vivo and in vitro MDS models. Intriguingly, the suppression effect is reversible and mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from MDS cells. These findings shed light on the novel MDS EV-MSC axis in ineffective hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Perturbed gut microbiome development has been linked to childhood malnutrition. Here, we characterize bacterial Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) protein domains that metabolize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a co-enzyme with far-reaching effects on human physiology. A consortium of 26 human gut bacterial strains, representing the diversity of TIRs observed in the microbiome and the NAD hydrolase (NADase) activities of a subset of 152 bacterial TIRs assayed in vitro, was introduced into germ-free mice. Integrating mass spectrometry and microbial RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with consortium membership manipulation disclosed that a variant of cyclic-ADPR (v-cADPR-x) is a specific product of TIR NADase activity and a prominent, colonization-discriminatory, taxon-specific metabolite. Guided by bioinformatic analyses of biochemically validated TIRs, we find that acute malnutrition is associated with decreased fecal levels of genes encoding TIRs known or predicted to generate v-cADPR-x, as well as decreased levels of the metabolite itself. These results underscore the need to consider microbiome TIR NADases when evaluating NAD metabolism in the human holobiont.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons in the developing brain express many different cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on their surfaces. CAM-binding affinities can vary by more than 200-fold, but the significance of these variations is unknown. Interactions between the immunoglobulin superfamily CAM DIP-α and its binding partners, Dpr10 and Dpr6, control synaptic targeting and survival of Drosophila optic lobe neurons. We design mutations that systematically change interaction affinity and analyze function in vivo. Reducing affinity causes loss-of-function phenotypes whose severity scales with the magnitude of the change. Synaptic targeting is more sensitive to affinity reduction than is cell survival. Increasing affinity rescues neurons that would normally be culled by apoptosis. By manipulating CAM expression together with affinity, we show that the key parameter controlling circuit assembly is surface avidity, which is the strength of adherence between cell surfaces. We conclude that CAM binding affinities and expression levels are finely tuned for function during development.

Abstract: Summary
RNA concentration homeostasis involves coordinating RNA abundance and synthesis rates with cell size. Here, we study this in human cells by combining genome-wide perturbations with quantitative single-cell measurements. Despite relative ease in perturbing RNA synthesis, we find that RNA concentrations generally remain highly constant. Perturbations that would be expected to increase nuclear mRNA levels, including those targeting nuclear mRNA degradation or export, result in downregulation of RNA synthesis. This is associated with reduced abundance of transcription-associated proteins and protein states that are normally coordinated with RNA production in single cells, including RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) itself. Acute perturbations, elevation of nuclear mRNA levels, and mathematical modeling indicate that mammalian cells achieve robust mRNA concentration homeostasis by the mRNA-based negative feedback on transcriptional activity in the nucleus. This ultimately acts to coordinate RNA Pol II abundance with nuclear mRNA degradation and export rates and may underpin the scaling of mRNA abundance with cell size.

Abstract: Summary
The design of an animal’s body plan is encoded in the genome, and the execution of this program is a mechanical progression involving coordinated movement of proteins, cells, and whole tissues. Thus, a challenge to understanding morphogenesis is connecting events that occur across various length scales. Here, we describe how a poorly characterized adhesion effector, Arvcf catenin, controls Xenopus head-to-tail axis extension. We find that Arvcf is required for axis extension within the intact organism but not within isolated tissues. We show that the organism-scale phenotype results from a defect in tissue-scale force production. Finally, we determine that the force defect results from the dampening of the pulsatile recruitment of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins to membranes. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of Arvcf function during axis extension and produce an insight into how a cellular-scale defect in adhesion results in an organism-scale failure of development.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubule (MT) modifications are critical during axon development, with stable MTs populating the axon. How these modifications are spatially coordinated is unclear. Here, via high-resolution microscopy, we show that early developing neurons have fewer somatic acetylated MTs restricted near the centrosome. At later stages, however, acetylated MTs spread out in soma and concentrate in growing axon. Live imaging in early plated neurons of the MT plus-end protein, EB3, show increased displacement and growth rate near the MTOC, suggesting local differences that might support axon selection. Moreover, F-actin disruption in early developing neurons, which show fewer somatic acetylated MTs, does not induce multiple axons, unlike later stages. Overexpression of centrosomal protein 120 (Cep120), which promotes MT acetylation/stabilization, induces multiple axons, while its knockdown downregulates proteins modulating MT dynamics and stability, hampering axon formation. Collectively, we show how centrosome-dependent MT modifications contribute to axon formation.

Abstract: Summary
Pausing by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAp) is vital in the recruitment of regulatory factors, RNA folding, and coupled translation. While backtracking and intra-structural isomerization have been proposed to trigger pausing, our mechanistic understanding of backtrack-associated pauses and catalytic recovery remains incomplete. Using high-throughput magnetic tweezers, we examine the Escherichia coli RNAp transcription dynamics over a wide range of forces and NTP concentrations. Dwell-time analysis and stochastic modeling identify, in addition to a short-lived elemental pause, two distinct long-lived backtrack pause states differing in recovery rates. We identify two stochastic sources of transcription heterogeneity: alterations in short-pause frequency that underlies elongation-rate switching, and variations in RNA cleavage rates in long-lived backtrack states. Together with effects of force and Gre factors, we demonstrate that recovery from deep backtracks is governed by intrinsic RNA cleavage rather than diffusional Brownian dynamics. We introduce a consensus mechanistic model that unifies our findings with prior models.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres are specialized chromosome loci that seed the kinetochore, a large protein complex that effects chromosome segregation. A 16-subunit complex, the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN), connects between the specialized centromeric chromatin, marked by the histone H3 variant CENP-A, and the spindle-binding moiety of the kinetochore. Here, we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of human CCAN. We highlight unique features such as the pseudo GTPase CENP-M and report how a crucial CENP-C motif binds the CENP-LN complex. The CCAN structure has implications for the mechanism of specific recognition of the CENP-A nucleosome. A model consistent with our structure depicts the CENP-C-bound nucleosome as connected to the CCAN through extended, flexible regions of CENP-C. An alternative model identifies both CENP-C and CENP-N as specificity determinants but requires CENP-N to bind CENP-A in a mode distinct from the classical nucleosome octamer.

Abstract: Summary
Muscleblind (mbl) is an essential muscle and neuronal splicing regulator. Mbl hosts multiple circular RNAs (circRNAs), including circMbl, which is conserved from flies to humans. Here, we show that mbl-derived circRNAs are key regulators of MBL by cis- and trans-acting mechanisms. By generating fly lines to specifically modulate the levels of all mbl RNA isoforms, including circMbl, we demonstrate that the two major mbl protein isoforms, MBL-O/P and MBL-C, buffer their own levels by producing different types of circRNA isoforms in the eye and fly brain, respectively. Moreover, we show that circMbl has unique functions in trans, as knockdown of circMbl results in specific morphological and physiological phenotypes. In addition, depletion of MBL-C or circMbl results in opposite behavioral phenotypes, showing that they also regulate each other in trans. Together, our results illuminate key aspects of mbl regulation and uncover cis and trans functions of circMbl in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) is a regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitors IκBs. NEMO mediates IKK activation by binding to polyubiquitin chains (polyUb). Here, we show that Lys63(K63)-linked or linear polyUb binding to NEMO robustly induced the formation of liquid-like droplets in which IKK was activated. This liquid phase separation of NEMO was driven by multivalent interactions between NEMO and polyUb. Both the NEMO ubiquitin-binding (NUB) domain and the zinc-finger (ZF) domain of NEMO mediated binding to polyUb and contributed to NEMO phase separation and IKK activation in cells. Moreover, NEMO mutations associated with human immunodeficiency impaired its phase separation. These results demonstrate that polyUb activates IKK and NF-κB signaling by promoting the phase separation of NEMO.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve into variants of concern (VOC), with greatest variability in the multidomain, entry-facilitating spike proteins. To recognize the significance of adaptive spike protein changes, we compare variant SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in several assays reflecting authentic virus-cell entry. Virus particles with adaptive changes in spike amino-terminal domains (NTDs) are hypersensitive to proteolytic activation of membrane fusion, an essential step in virus-cell entry. Proteolysis is within fusion domains (FDs), at sites over 10 nm from the VOC-specific NTD changes, indicating allosteric inter-domain control of fusion activation. In addition, NTD-specific antibodies block FD cleavage, membrane fusion, and virus-cell entry, suggesting restriction of inter-domain communication as a neutralization mechanism. Finally, using structure-guided mutagenesis, we identify an inter-monomer β sheet structure that facilitates NTD-to-FD transmissions and subsequent fusion activation. This NTD-to-FD axis that sensitizes viruses to infection and to NTD-specific antibody neutralization provides new context for understanding selective forces driving SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Assemblies of tau can transit between neurons, seeding aggregation in a prion-like manner. To accomplish this, tau must cross cell-limiting membranes, a process that is poorly understood. Here, we establish assays for the study of tau entry into the cytosol as a phenomenon distinct from uptake, in real time, and at physiological concentrations. The entry pathway of tau is cell type specific and, in neurons, highly sensitive to cholesterol. Depletion of the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick type C1 or extraction of membrane cholesterol renders neurons highly permissive to tau entry and potentiates seeding even at low levels of exogenous tau assemblies. Conversely, cholesterol supplementation reduces entry and almost completely blocks seeded aggregation. Our findings establish entry as a rate-limiting step to seeded aggregation and demonstrate that dysregulated cholesterol, a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, potentiates tau aggregation by promoting entry of tau assemblies into the cell interior.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotes maintain cellular health through the engulfment and subsequent degradation of intracellular cargo using macroautophagy. The function of Atg23, despite being critical to the efficiency of this process, is unclear due to a lack of biochemical investigations and an absence of any structural information. In this study, we use a combination of in vitro and in vivo methods to show that Atg23 exists primarily as a homodimer, a conformation facilitated by a putative amphipathic helix. We utilize small-angle X-ray scattering to monitor the overall shape of Atg23, revealing that it contains an extended rod-like structure spanning approximately 320 Å. We also demonstrate that Atg23 interacts with membranes directly, primarily through electrostatic interactions, and that these interactions lead to vesicle tethering. Finally, mutation of the hydrophobic face of the putative amphipathic helix completely precludes dimer formation, leading to severely impaired subcellular localization, vesicle tethering, Atg9 binding, and autophagic efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-encapsulated particles that carry genetically active and protein/lipid cargo that can affect the function of the recipient cell. A number of studies have described the effect of these vesicles on recipient cells and demonstrated their promise as therapeutic delivery vectors. Here we demonstrate functional delivery of EV-encapsulated RNA and protein cargo through use of luminescence and fluorescence reporters by combining organelle-targeted nanoluciferase with fluorescent proteins. We highlight a mechanism by which cells retain internalized cargo in the endosomal compartment for days, usually leading to content degradation. We also identify a mode through which recipient cells re-release internalized EVs intact after uptake. Highlighting these different fates of EVs in recipient cells sheds light on critical factors in steering functional cargo delivery and will ultimately allow more efficient use of EVs for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: Summary
Tn7 is a bacterial transposon with relatives containing element-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems mediating RNA-guided transposon insertion. Here, we present the 2.7 Å cryoelectron microscopy structure of prototypic Tn7 transposase TnsB interacting with the transposon end DNA. When TnsB interacts across repeating binding sites, it adopts a beads-on-a-string architecture, where the DNA-binding and catalytic domains are arranged in a tiled and intertwined fashion. The DNA-binding domains form few base-specific contacts leading to a binding preference that requires multiple weakly conserved sites at the appropriate spacing to achieve DNA sequence specificity. TnsB binding imparts differences in the global structure of the protein-bound DNA ends dictated by the spacing or overlap of binding sites explaining functional differences in the left and right ends of the element. We propose a model of the strand-transfer complex in which the terminal TnsB molecule is rearranged so that its catalytic domain is in a position conducive to transposition.

Abstract: Summary
The presence and abundance of viral proteins within host cells are part of the essential signatures of the cellular stages of viral infections. However, methods that can comprehensively detect and quantify these proteins are still limited, particularly for viruses with large protein coding capacity. Here, we design and experimentally validate a mass spectrometry-based Targeted herpesviRUS proTEin Detection (TRUSTED) assay for monitoring human viruses representing the three Herpesviridae subfamilies—herpes simplex virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. We demonstrate assay applicability for (1) capturing the temporal cascades of viral replication, (2) detecting proteins throughout a range of virus concentrations and in in vivo models of infection, (3) assessing the effects of clinical therapeutic agents and sirtuin-modulating compounds, (4) studies using different laboratory and clinical viral strains, and (5) discovering a role for carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 in supporting HCMV replication.

Abstract: Summary
Listeria monocytogenes strain 10403S harbors two phage elements in its chromosome; one produces infective virions and the other tailocins. It was previously demonstrated that induction of the two elements is coordinated, as they are regulated by the same anti-repressor. In this study, we identified AriS as another phage regulator that controls the two elements, bearing the capacity to inhibit their lytic induction under SOS conditions. AriS is a two-domain protein that possesses two distinct activities, one regulating the genes of its encoding phage and the other downregulating the bacterial SOS response. While the first activity associates with the AriS N-terminal AntA/AntB domain, the second associates with its C-terminal ANT/KilAC domain. The ANT/KilAC domain is conserved in many AriS-like proteins of listerial and non-listerial prophages, suggesting that temperate phages acquired such dual-function regulators to align their response with the other phage elements that cohabit the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Notch-mediated lateral specification is a fundamental mechanism to resolve stochastic cell fate choices by amplifying initial differences between equivalent cells. To study how stochastic events impact Notch activity, we developed a biosensor, SALSA (sensor able to detect lateral signaling activity), consisting of an amplifying “switch”—Notch tagged with TEV protease—and a “reporter”—GFP fused to a nuclearly localized red fluorescent protein, separated by a TEVp cut site. When ligand activates Notch, TEVp enters the nucleus and releases GFP from its nuclear tether, allowing Notch activation to be quantified based on the changes in GFP subcellular localization. We show that SALSA accurately reports Notch activity in different signaling paradigms in Caenorhabditis elegans and use time-lapse imaging to test hypotheses about how stochastic elements ensure a reproducible and robust outcome in a canonical lin-12/Notch-mediated lateral signaling paradigm. SALSA should be generalizable to other experimental systems and be adaptable to increase options for bespoke “SynNotch” applications.

Abstract: Summary
A common theme across multiple successful immunotherapies for cancer is the recognition of tumor-specific mutations (neoantigens) by T cells. The rapid discovery of such antigen responses could lead to improved therapies through the adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express neoantigen-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, through CITE-seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) and TCR-seq of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), we develop a neoantigen-reactive T cell signature based on clonotype frequency and CD39 protein and CXCL13 mRNA expression. Screening of TCRs selected by the signature allows us to identify neoantigen-reactive TCRs with a success rate of 45% for CD8+ and 66% for CD4+ T cells. Because of the small number of samples analyzed (4 patients), generalizability remains to be tested. However, this approach can enable the quick identification of neoantigen-reactive TCRs and expedite the engineering of personalized neoantigen-reactive T cells for therapy.

Abstract: Hypoxia leads to significant cellular stress that has diverse pathological consequences such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of regulators of the adaptive pathway in hypoxia. We identified a hypoxia-induced miRNA, miR-34c, that was significantly upregulated in hypoxic human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in murine blood vessels on day 3 of hindlimb ischemia (HLI). miR-34c directly inhibited BCL2 expression, acting as a toggle switch between apoptosis and autophagy in vitro and in vivo. BCL2 repression by miR-34c activated autophagy, which was evaluated by the expression of LC3-II. Overexpression of miR-34c inhibited apoptosis in HUVEC as well as in a murine model of HLI, and increased cell viability in HUVEC. Importantly, the number of viable cells in the blood vessels following HLI was increased by miR-34c overexpression. Collectively, our findings show that miR-34c plays a protective role in hypoxia, suggesting a novel therapeutic target for hypoxic and ischemic diseases in the blood vessels.

Abstract: Summary
While severe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface, responses to asymptomatic/mild severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy remain unknown. Here, we assess immunological adaptations in blood and term decidua in response to asymptomatic/mild disease in pregnant women. We report attenuated antigen presentation and type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways, loss of tissue-resident decidual macrophages, and upregulated cytokine/chemokine signaling in monocyte-derived decidual macrophages. Furthermore, we describe increased frequencies of activated tissue-resident T cells and decreased abundance of regulatory T cells with infection while frequencies of cytotoxic CD4/CD8 T cells are increased in the blood. In contrast to decidual macrophages, type I IFN signaling is higher in decidual T cells. Finally, infection leads to a narrowing of T cell receptor diversity in both blood and decidua. Collectively, these observations indicate that asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 during pregnancy results in remodeling of the immunological landscape of the maternal-fetal interface, with a potential for long-term adverse outcomes for the offspring.

Abstract: Summary
During productive human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, viral genes are expressed in a coordinated cascade that conventionally relies on the dependencies of viral genes on protein synthesis and viral DNA replication. By contrast, the transcriptional landscape of HCMV latency is poorly understood. Here, we examine viral gene expression dynamics during the establishment of both productive and latent HCMV infections. We redefine HCMV gene expression kinetics during productive infection and reveal that viral gene regulation does not represent a simple sequential cascade; many viral genes are regulated by multiple independent modules. Using our improved gene expression classification combined with transcriptome-wide measurements of the effects of a wide array of epigenetic inhibitors on viral gene expression during latency, we show that a defining feature of latency is the unique repression of immediate-early (IE) genes. Altogether, we recharacterize HCMV gene expression kinetics and reveal governing principles of lytic and latent gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholipase A2, group VII (PLA2G7) is widely recognized as a secreted, lipoprotein-associated PLA2 in plasma that converts phospholipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) to a biologically inactive product Lyso-PAF during inflammatory response. We report that intracellular PLA2G7 is selectively important for cell proliferation and tumor growth potential of melanoma cells expressing mutant NRAS, but not cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, PLA2G7 signals through its product Lyso-PAF to contribute to RAF1 activation by mutant NRAS, which is bypassed by BRAF V600E. Intracellular Lyso-PAF promotes p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) activation by binding to its catalytic domain and altering ATP kinetics, while PAK2 significantly contributes to S338-phosphorylation of RAF1 in addition to PAK1. Furthermore, the PLA2G7-PAK2 axis is also required for full activation of RAF1 in cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or cancer cells expressing mutant KRAS. Thus, PLA2G7 and Lyso-PAF exhibit intracellular signaling functions as key elements of RAS-RAF1 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
We report that increasing inhibition from the basal ganglia (BG) to the superior colliculus (SC) through the substantia nigra pars reticulata (nigra) using in vivo optogenetic activation of GABAergic terminals in mice produces contralateral orienting movements. These movements are unexpected because decreases, and not increases, in nigral activity are generally associated with the initiation of orienting movements. We found that, in slice recordings, the same optogenetic stimulation of nigral terminals producing movements in vivo evokes post-inhibitory rebound depolarization followed by Na+ spikes in SC output neurons. Moreover, blocking T-type Ca2+ channels in slices prevent post-inhibitory rebound and subsequent Na+ spiking in SC output neurons and also reduce the likelihood of contralateral orienting in vivo. On the basis of these results, we propose that, in addition to the permissive role, the BG may play an active role in the generation of orienting movements in mice by driving post-inhibitory rebound depolarization in SC output neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue (AT) plays a central role in systemic metabolic homeostasis, but its function during bacterial infection remains unclear. Following subcutaneous bacterial infection, adipocytes surrounding draining lymph nodes initiated a transcriptional response indicative of stimulation with IFN-γ and a shift away from lipid metabolism toward an immunologic function. Natural killer (NK) and invariant NK T (iNKT) cells were identified as sources of infection-induced IFN-γ in perinodal AT (PAT). IFN-γ induced Nos2 expression in adipocytes through a process dependent on nuclear-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) sensing of live intracellular bacteria. iNOS expression was coupled to metabolic rewiring, inducing increased diversion of extracellular L-arginine through the arginosuccinate shunt and urea cycle to produce nitric oxide (NO), directly mediating bacterial clearance. In vivo, control of infection in adipocytes was dependent on adipocyte-intrinsic sensing of IFN-γ and expression of iNOS. Thus, adipocytes are licensed by innate lymphocytes to acquire anti-bacterial functions during infection.

Abstract: Summary
Ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS) can develop in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, but the precise pathways of B cell activation and selection are not well understood. Here, we identify a synovial B cell population characterized by co-expression of a family of orphan nuclear receptors (NR4A1-3), which is highly enriched in RA synovial tissue. A transcriptomic profile of NR4A synovial B cells significantly overlaps with germinal center light zone B cells and an accrual of somatic hypermutation that correlates with loss of naive B cell state. NR4A B cells co-express lymphotoxins α and β and IL-6, supporting functions in ELS promotion. Expanded and shared clones between synovial NR4A B cells and plasma cells and the rapid upregulation with BCR stimulation point to in situ differentiation. Together, we identify a dynamic progression of B cell activation in RA synovial ELS, with NR4A transcription factors having an important role in local adaptive immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
PTEN is known as a tumor suppressor and plays essential roles in brain development. Here, we report that PTEN in primary sensory neurons is involved in processing itch and thermal information in adult mice. Deletion of PTEN in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) is achieved in adult Drg11-CreER: PTENflox/flox (PTEN CKO) mice with oral administration of tamoxifen, and CKO mice develop pathological itch and elevated itch responses on exposure to various pruritogens. PTEN deletion leads to ectopic expression of TRPV1 and MrgprA3 in IB4+ non-peptidergic DRG neurons, and the TRPV1 is responsive to capsaicin. Importantly, the elevated itch responses are no longer present in Drg11-CreER: PTENflox/flox: TRPV1flox/flox (PTEN: TRPV1 dCKO) mice. In addition, thermal stimulation is enhanced in PTEN CKO mice but blunted in dCKO mice. PTEN-involved regulation of itch-related gene expression in DRG neurons provides insights for understanding molecular mechanism of itch and thermal sensation at the spinal level.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid A, the membrane-anchored portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is an essential component of the outer membrane (OM) of nearly all Gram-negative bacteria. Here we identify regulatory and structural factors that together render lipid A nonessential in Caulobacter crescentus. Mutations in the ferric uptake regulator fur allow Caulobacter to survive in the absence of either LpxC, which catalyzes an early step of lipid A synthesis, or CtpA, a tyrosine phosphatase homolog we find is needed for wild-type lipid A structure and abundance. Alterations in Fur-regulated processes, rather than iron status per se, underlie the ability to survive when lipid A synthesis is blocked. Fitness of lipid A-deficient Caulobacter requires an anionic sphingolipid, ceramide phosphoglycerate (CPG), which also mediates sensitivity to the antibiotic colistin. Our results demonstrate that, in an altered regulatory landscape, anionic sphingolipids can support the integrity of a lipid A-deficient OM.

Abstract: Background
This study compared the effect of ultrasound microbubble-mediated miR-503–5p downregulation with that of pure liposome-mediated miR-503–5p downregulation on colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and explored the downstream mechanism.
Methods
Bioinformatics tools were utilized to predict miR-503–5p-targeted genes and CRC progression-associated genes. MiR-503–5p and sal-like 1 (SALL1) expressions in CRC cells and tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR and/or bioinformatics tools; their correlations with overall survival and clinicopathological features of CRC patients were presented, and their interaction was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. CRC cells received ultrasound microbubble-mediated miR-503–5p downregulation and/or liposome-mediated miR-503–5p downregulation or SALL1 silencing. Cell phenotype changes were evaluated by flow cytometry, as well as MTT, Wound healing, Transwell and tube formation assays. E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)− 2, Cleaved caspase-3, and SALL1 expressions in cells were analyzed by Western blot.
Results
Upregulated miR-503–5p in CRC tissues and cells was detected, associated with poorer cell differentiation, easier lymph node metastasis and higher TNM stages, and related to poorer prognoses of CRC patients. Ultrasound microbubble-mediated miR-503–5p downregulation relative to pure liposome-mediated miR-503–5p downregulation better decreased viability, inhibited migration, invasion and tube formation, enhanced apoptosis, upregulated SALL1, E-cadherin and Cleaved caspase-3, and downregulated miR-503–5p, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Bcl-2 in CRC cells. SALL1 was targeted by miR-503–5p, low-expressed in CRC tissues and cells and positively related to CRC patients’ survival. Silencing SALL1 exerted the opposite effects, which reversed the effects of ultrasound microbubble-mediated miR-503–5p downregulation and vice versa.
Conclusion
Ultrasound microbubble-mediated miR-503–5p downregulation suppressed in vitro CRC progression via promoting SALL1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
The rapidly spreading Omicron variant is highly resistant to vaccines, convalescent sera, and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), highlighting the urgent need for potent therapeutic nAbs. Here, a panel of human nAbs from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent patients show diverse neutralization against Omicron, of which XMA01 and XMA04 maintain nanomolar affinities and excellent neutralization (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]: ∼20 ng/mL). nAb XMA09 shows weak but unattenuated neutralization against all variants of concern (VOCs) as well as SARS-CoV. Structural analysis reveals that the above three antibodies could synergistically bind to the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of both wild-type and Omicron spikes and defines the critical determinants for nAb-mediated broad neutralizations. Three nAbs confer synergistic neutralization against Omicron, resulting from the inter-antibody interaction between XMA04 and XMA01(or XMA09). Furthermore, the XMA01/XMA04 cocktail provides synergistic protection against Beta and Omicron variant infections in hamsters. In summary, our results provide insights for the rational design of antibody cocktail therapeutics or universal vaccines against Omicron.

Abstract: Aim
The regulation of GPX4 by A1AR and A2bAR was investigated, and whether the inhibition of A1AR and A2bAR on ferroptosis of myocardial cell is related to GPX4 was also discussed.
Methods
we constructed a rat model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (MIR) model and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model of H9C2 cells, and MIR rats were intraperitoneally injected with A1AR and A2bAR agonists and antagonists. TTC staining, DHE, TUNEL, western blot experiments, immunohistochemistry assay were implemented to analyze the influence of A1AR and A2bAR on ferroptosis and potential role of GPX4. To further authenticate the result of non-specific agonists and antagonists, we transfected siRNA interference or overexpression vectors into cells. CCK8, flow cytometry and western blot were performed to evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis, and the expression of GPX4 and ferroptosis-related proteins.
Results
The experimental results showed that reduced expression of A1AR, A2bAR and GPX4 was found after MIR. A1AR and A2bAR activation by agonists increased GPX4 expression and decreased production of lipid ROS, further inhibiting apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In addition, we also analyzed the effect of A1AR and A2bAR on ferroptosis-related proteins. We found that expression of FIH1 protein increased and expression of ACSL4 and NOX1 proteins decreased. Consistent with results in vivo, cellular data also indicated that A1AR and A2bAR overexpression could increase proliferation ability of H9C2, and inhibit apoptosis and ROS production, upregulate GPX4 and FIH1, and downregulate ACSL4 and NOX1.
Conclusion
A1AR and A2bAR could regulate GPX4, thereby affecting ferroptosis of cardiomyocytes in a rat model of MIR.

Abstract: Müller glia, a pillar of metabolic, volume regulatory and immune/inflammatory signaling in the mammalian retina, are among the earliest responders to mechanical stressors in the eye. Ocular trauma, edema, detachment and glaucoma evoke early inflammatory activation of Müller cells yet the identity of their mechanotransducers and signaling mechanisms downstream remains unknown. Here, we investigate expression of genes that encode putative stretch-activated calcium channels (SACs) in mouse Müller cells and study their responses to dynamical tensile loading in cells loaded with a calcium indicator dye. Transcript levels in purified glia were Trpc1>Piezo1>Trpv2>Trpv4>>Trpv1>Trpa1. Cyclic radial deformation of matrix-coated substrates produced dose-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i that were suppressed by the TRPV4 channel antagonist HC-067047 and by ablation of the Trpv4 gene. Stretch-evoked calcium responses were also reduced by knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of TRPC1 channels whereas the TRPV2 inhibitor tranilast had no effect. These data demonstrate that Müller cells are intrinsically mechanosensitive, with the response to tensile loading mediated through synergistic activation of TRPV4 and TRPC1 channels. Coupling between mechanical stress and Müller Ca2+ homeostasis has treatment implications, since many neuronal injury paradigms in the retina involve calcium dysregulation associated with inflammatory and immune signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Direct myocardial and vascular injuries due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-driven inflammation is the leading cause of acute cardiac injury associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, in-depth knowledge of the injury characteristics of the heart affected by inflammation is lacking. In this study, using a quantitative spatial proteomics strategy that combines comparative anatomy, laser-capture microdissection, and histological examination, we establish a region-resolved proteome map of the myocardia and microvessels with obvious inflammatory cells from hearts of patients with COVID-19. A series of molecular dysfunctions of myocardia and microvessels is observed in different cardiac regions. The myocardia and microvessels of the left atrial are the most susceptible to virus infection and inflammatory storm, suggesting more attention should be paid to the lesion and treatment of these two parts. These results can guide in improving clinical treatments for cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19.

Abstract: Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), a hub of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), is required for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. HIV-1 infection can upregulate the expression of α7 nAChR in T lymphocytes and affect the role of CAP. However, whether α7 nAChR regulates HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells is unclear. In this study, we first found that activation of α7 nAChR by GTS-21 (an α7 nAChR agonist) can promote the transcription of HIV-1 proviral DNA. Then, through transcriptome sequencing analysis, we found that p38 MAPK signaling was enriched in GTS-21 treated HIV-latent T cells. Mechanistically, activation of α7 nAChR could increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduce DUSP1 and DUSP6, and consequently enhance the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. By co-immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we found that p-p38 MAPK interacted with Lamin B1 (LMNB1). Activation of α7 nAChR increased the binding between p-p38 MAPK and LMNB1. We confirmed that knockdown of MAPK14 significantly downregulated NFATC4, a key activator of HIV-1 transcription. Taken together, activation of the α7 nAChR could trigger ROS/p-p38 MAPK/LMNB1/NFATC4 signaling pathway enhancing HIV-1 transcription. We have revealed an unrecognized mechanism of α7 nAChR-mediated neuroimmune regulation of HIV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Our internal sense of direction is thought to rely on the activity of head-direction (HD) neurons. We find that the mouse dorsal presubiculum (PreS), a key structure in the cortical representation of HD, displays a modular “patch-matrix” organization, which is conserved across species (including human). Calbindin-positive layer 2 neurons within the “matrix” form modular recurrent microcircuits, while inputs from the anterodorsal and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei are non-overlapping and target the “patch” and “matrix” compartments, respectively. The apical dendrites of identified HD cells are largely restricted within the “matrix,” pointing to a non-random sampling of patterned inputs and to a precise structure-function architecture. Optogenetic perturbation of modular recurrent microcircuits results in a drastic tonic suppression of firing only in a subpopulation of HD neurons. Altogether, our data reveal a modular microcircuit organization of the PreS HD map and point to the existence of cell-type-specific microcircuits that support the cortical HD representation.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic gluconeogenesis from amino acids contributes significantly to diabetic hyperglycemia, but the molecular mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. Alanine transaminases (ALT1 and ALT2) catalyze the interconversion of alanine and pyruvate, which is required for gluconeogenesis from alanine. We find that ALT2 is overexpressed in the liver of diet-induced obese and db/db mice and that the expression of the gene encoding ALT2 (GPT2) is downregulated following bariatric surgery in people with obesity. The increased hepatic expression of Gpt2 in db/db liver is mediated by activating transcription factor 4, an endoplasmic reticulum stress-activated transcription factor. Hepatocyte-specific knockout of Gpt2 attenuates incorporation of 13C-alanine into newly synthesized glucose by hepatocytes. In vivo Gpt2 knockdown or knockout in liver has no effect on glucose concentrations in lean mice, but Gpt2 suppression alleviates hyperglycemia in db/db mice. These data suggest that ALT2 plays a significant role in hepatic gluconeogenesis from amino acids in diabetes.

Abstract: Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) derived from discarded orthodontic teeth are easily obtained and have become a promising source for mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy. However, the pulp tissue is limited, and long-term culture induces cell senescence. Hypoxic culture was expected to be suitable for DPSC expansion, but the results have been contradictory. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of hypoxic culture on human DPSCs (hDPSCs). hDPSCs were isolated and cultured in normoxic (ambient O2 concentration) and hypoxic (5% O2) environments from passage 3 (P3) to P6. The biological characteristics of the cells at P4 (short-term culture) and P6 (long-term culture) were evaluated, including the expression of surface markers, cellular proliferation activity, cellular senescence, and spontaneous and induced differentiation. The results showed that the morphology, phenotype, and proliferation activity of hDPSCs were not affected by hypoxic culture. Long-term normoxic culture of hDPSCs induced cell stemness loss and cell senescence, while hypoxic culture could alleviate these effects. The expression of the stemness markers STRO-1 and OCT4 was increased and the number of senescent cells and the expression of the senescence-related genes P53 and TGF-β were reduced by long-term hypoxic culture. Spontaneous osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation did not occur during long-term normoxic culture. However, hypoxic culture suppressed the expression of the osteogenic markers ALP and RUNX-2 and the adipogenic markers PPAR-γ and FABP4. The induced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation was apparently reduced by hypoxic culture as well. Our findings indicate that long-term hypoxia culture is beneficial to the maintenance of hDPSCs’ biological characteristics and provide some insights into their large-scale expansion.

Abstract: The surface of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria contains long hair-like proteinaceous protrusion known as pili or fimbriae. Historically, pilin proteins were considered to play a major role in the transfer of genetic material during bacterial conjugation. Recent findings however elucidate their importance in virulence, biofilm formation, phage transduction, and motility. Therefore, it is crucial to gain mechanistic insights on the subcellular assembly of pili and the localization patterns of their subunit proteins (major and minor pilins) that aid the macromolecular pilus assembly at the bacterial surface. In this article, we review the current knowledge of pilus assembly mechanisms in a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including subcellular localization patterns of a few pilin subunit proteins and their role in virulence and pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Differential interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling and production are associated with disparate effector and memory fates. Whether the IL-2 signals perceived by CD8 T cells come from autocrine or paracrine sources, the timing of IL-2 signaling and their differential impact on CD8 T cell responses remain unclear. Using distinct models of germline and conditional IL-2 ablation in post-thymic CD8 T cells, this study shows that paracrine IL-2 is sufficient to drive optimal primary expansion, effector and memory differentiation, and metabolic function. In contrast, autocrine IL-2 is uniquely required during primary expansion to program robust secondary expansion potential in memory-fated cells. This study further shows that IL-2 production by antigen-specific CD8 T cells is largely independent of CD4 licensing of dendritic cells (DCs) in inflammatory infections with robust DC activation. These findings bear implications for immunizations and adoptive T cell immunotherapies, where effector and memory functions may be commandeered through IL-2 programming.

Abstract: Summary
Aging men display reduced reproductive health; however, testis aging is poorly understood at the molecular and genomic levels. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA-seq to profile over 44,000 cells from both young and older men and examined age-related changes in germline development and in the testicular somatic cells. Age-related changes in spermatogonial stem cells appeared modest, whereas age-related dysregulation of spermatogenesis and somatic cells ranged from moderate to severe. Altered pathways included signaling and inflammation in multiple cell types, metabolic signaling in Sertoli cells, hedgehog signaling and testosterone production in Leydig cells, cell death and growth in testicular peritubular cells, and possible developmental regression in both Leydig and peritubular cells. Remarkably, the extent of dysregulation correlated with body mass index in older but not in younger men. Collectively, we reveal candidate molecular mechanisms underlying the complex testicular changes conferred by aging and their possible exacerbation by concurrent chronic conditions such as obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations are acquired frequently, such that each cell’s genome inscribes its history of cell divisions. Common genomic alterations involve loss of heterozygosity (LOH). LOH accumulates throughout the genome, offering large encoding capacity for inferring cell lineage. Using only single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of mouse brain cells, we found that LOH events spanning multiple genes are revealed as tracts of monoallelically expressed, constitutionally heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). We simultaneously inferred cell lineage and marked developmental time points based on X chromosome inactivation and the total number of LOH events while identifying cell types from gene expression patterns. Our results are consistent with progenitor cells giving rise to multiple cortical cell types through stereotyped expansion and distinct waves of neurogenesis. This type of retrospective analysis could be incorporated into scRNA-seq pipelines and, compared with experimental approaches for determining lineage in model organisms, is applicable where genetic engineering is prohibited, such as humans.

Abstract: The advent of the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) has shown great potential as a leading method for analyzing the genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility. A comprehensive reference to the ATAC-seq dataset for disease progression is important for understanding the regulatory specificity caused by genetic or epigenetic changes. In this study, we present a genome-wide chromatin accessibility profile of 44 liver samples spanning the full histological spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We analyzed the ATAC-seq signal enrichment, fragment size distribution, and correlation coefficients according to the histological severity of NAFLD (healthy control vs steatosis vs fibrotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), demonstrating the high quality of the dataset. Consequently, 112,303 merged regions (genomic regions containing one or multiple overlapping peak regions) were identified. Additionally, we found differentially accessible regions (DARs) and performed transcription factor binding motif enrichment analysis and de novo motif analysis to determine new biomarker candidates. These data revealed the gene-regulatory interactions and noncoding factors that can affect NAFLD progression. In summary, our study provides a valuable resource for the human epigenome by applying an advanced approach to facilitate diagnosis and treatment by understanding the non-coding genome of NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric cancer with features of skeletal muscle; patients with unresectable or metastatic RMS fare poorly due to high rates of disease recurrence. Here, we use single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to show that RMS tumors recapitulate the spectrum of embryonal myogenesis. Using matched patient samples from a clinical trial and orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (O-PDXs), we show that chemotherapy eliminates the most proliferative component with features of myoblasts within embryonal RMS; after treatment, the immature population with features of paraxial mesoderm expands to reconstitute the developmental hierarchy of the original tumor. We discovered that this paraxial mesoderm population is dependent on EGFR signaling and is sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. Taken together, these data serve as a proof of concept that targeting each developmental state in embryonal RMS is an effective strategy for improving outcomes by preventing disease recurrence.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) is well established as a mesenchyme-derived growth factor and a critical regulator of fetal organ development in mice and humans. Using a single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) atlas of salivary gland (SG) and a tamoxifen inducible Fgf10CreERT2:R26-tdTomato mouse, we show that FGF10pos cells are exclusively mesenchymal until postnatal day 5 (P5) but, after P7, there is a switch in expression and only epithelial FGF10pos cells are observed after P15. Further RNA-seq analysis of sorted mesenchymal and epithelial FGF10pos cells shows that the epithelial FGF10pos population express the hallmarks of ancient ionocyte signature Forkhead box i1 and 2 (Foxi1, Foxi2), Achaete-scute homolog 3 (Ascl3), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr). We propose that epithelial FGF10pos cells are specialized SG ionocytes located in ducts and important for the ionic modification of saliva. In addition, they maintain FGF10-dependent gland homeostasis via communication with FGFR2bpos ductal and myoepithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular pathogens manipulate host cells to survive and thrive. Cellular sensing and signaling pathways are among the key host machineries deregulated to favor infection. In this study, we show that liver-stage Plasmodium parasites compete with the host to sequester a host endosomal-adaptor protein (APPL1) known to regulate signaling in response to endocytosis. The enrichment of APPL1 at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) involves an atypical Plasmodium Rab5 isoform (Rab5b). Depletion of host APPL1 alters neither the infection nor parasite development; however, upon overexpression of a GTPase-deficient host Rab5 mutant (hRab5_Q79L), the parasites are smaller and their PVM is stripped of APPL1. Infection with the GTPase-deficient Plasmodium berghei Rab5b mutant (PbRab5b_Q91L) in this case rescues the PVM APPL1 signal and parasite size. In summary, we observe a robust correlation between the level of APPL1 retention at the PVM and parasite size during exoerythrocytic development.

Abstract: Summary
Vaccines have generally been developed with limited insight into their molecular impact. While systems vaccinology enables characterization of mechanisms of action, these tools have yet to be applied to infants, who are at high risk of infection and receive the most vaccines. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) protects infants against disseminated tuberculosis (TB) and TB-unrelated infections via incompletely understood mechanisms. We employ mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics of blood plasma to profile BCG-induced infant responses in Guinea-Bissau in vivo and the US in vitro. BCG-induced lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) correlate with both TLR-agonist- and purified protein derivative (PPD, mycobacterial antigen)-induced blood cytokine production in vitro, raising the possibility that LPCs contribute to BCG immunogenicity. Analysis of an independent newborn cohort from The Gambia demonstrates shared vaccine-induced metabolites, such as phospholipids and sphingolipids. BCG-induced changes to the plasma lipidome and LPCs may contribute to its immunogenicity and inform the development of early life vaccines.

Abstract: Anthrax is a severe infectious disease caused by the Bacillus anthracis bacterium. This paper aims to design and implement a fast and reliable system based on microscopic image processing of patient tissue samples for the automatic diagnosis of anthrax and other tissues diseases, metastasis detection, patient prognosis, etc. An improved UNet++ architecture is proposed to segment microscopic images of patient tissue samples. The proposed model combines multi-scale features by adding skip connections in two paths; the forward path from the encoder to the decoder and the decoder path to the output. These new connections improve the performance of the UNet++. Integration of the squeeze and excitation-inception blocks in the new skip connections provides the network with features at different scales with different kernel sizes. Several convolutional networks are used as the backbone to extract powerful representations in the encoder section. The use of batch normalization, dropout technique, and LRelu activation function in this model accelerates convergence and increases the generalization power of the model. To overcome the problem of data imbalance of different classes, a weighted hybrid loss function is proposed, which further improved segmentation efficiency. The semantic segmentation results are converted to the instance segmentation using the marker-based watershed algorithm. Experimental results show that despite many challenges of microscopic image analysis, the proposed model is a reliable system for the automatic diagnosis of anthrax and other tissues diseases. It produces better results than state-of-the-art architectures.

Abstract: Summary
Biological tubes are fundamental units of most metazoan organs. Their defective morphogenesis can cause malformations and pathologies. An integral component of biological tubes is the extracellular matrix, present apically (aECM) and basally (BM). Studies using the Drosophila tracheal system established an essential function for the aECM in tubulogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the BM also plays a critical role in this process. We find that BM components are deposited in a spatial-temporal manner in the trachea. We show that laminins, core BM components, control size and shape of tracheal tubes and their topology within the embryo. At a cellular level, laminins control cell shape changes and distribution of the cortical cytoskeleton component α-spectrin. Finally, we report that the BM and aECM act independently—yet cooperatively—to control tube elongation and together to guarantee tissue integrity. Our results unravel key roles for the BM in shaping, positioning, and maintaining biological tubes.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokines released during chronic inflammatory diseases induce pro-inflammatory properties in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Here, we describe the development of a subgroup of human PMNs expressing CCR5, termed CCR5+ PMNs. Auto- and paracrine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling increases intracellular neutrophil elastase (ELANE) abundance and induces neutrophil extracellular traps formation (NETosis) in CCR5+ PMNs, and triggering of CCR5 amplifies NETosis. Membranous TNF (mTNF) outside-in signaling induces the formation of reactive oxygen species, known activators of NETosis. In vivo, we find an increased number of CCR5+ PMNs in the peripheral blood and inflamed lamina propria of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Notably, failure of anti-TNF therapy is associated with higher frequencies of CCR5+ PMNs. In conclusion, we identify a phenotype of pro-NETotic, CCR5+ PMNs present in inflamed tissue in vivo and inducible in vitro. These cells may reflect an important component of tissue damage during chronic inflammation and could be of diagnostic value.

Abstract: Summary
The determinants of severe COVID-19 in healthy adults are poorly understood, which limits the opportunity for early intervention. We present a multiomic analysis using machine learning to characterize the genomic basis of COVID-19 severity. We use single-cell multiome profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions. We discover >1,000 risk genes across 19 cell types, which account for 77% of the SNP-based heritability for severe disease. Genetic risk is particularly focused within natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, placing the dysfunction of these cells upstream of severe disease. Mendelian randomization and single-cell profiling of human NK cells support the role of NK cells and further localize genetic risk to CD56bright NK cells, which are key cytokine producers during the innate immune response. Rare variant analysis confirms the enrichment of severe-disease-associated genetic variation within NK-cell risk genes. Our study provides insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 with potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Although combination BRAF/MEK inhibition has produced significant survival benefits for BRAF p.V600 mutant melanomas, targeted therapies approved for BRAF non-p.V600 mutant melanomas remain limited. Through the analysis of 772 cutaneous melanoma exomes, we reveal that BRAF non-p.V600 mutations co-occurs more frequently with NF1 loss, but not with oncogenic NRAS mutations, than expected by chance. We present cell signaling data, which demonstrate that BRAF non-p.V600 mutants can signal as monomers and dimers within an NF1 loss context. Concordantly, BRAF inhibitors that inhibit both monomeric and dimeric BRAF synergize with MEK inhibition to significantly reduce cell viability in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in BRAF non-p.V600 mutant melanomas with co-occurring NF1 loss-of-function mutations. Our data suggest that patients harboring BRAF non-p.V600 mutant melanomas may benefit from current FDA-approved BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy currently reserved for BRAF p.V600 mutant patients.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome segregation in mammals relies on the maturation of a thick bundle of kinetochore-attached microtubules known as k-fiber. How k-fibers mature from initial kinetochore microtubule attachments remains a fundamental question. By combining molecular perturbations and phenotypic analyses in Indian muntjac fibroblasts containing the lowest known diploid chromosome number in mammals (2N = 6) and distinctively large kinetochores, with fixed/live-cell super-resolution coherent-hybrid stimulated emission depletion (CH-STED) nanoscopy and laser microsurgery, we demonstrate a key role for augmin in kinetochore microtubule self-organization and maturation, regardless of pioneer centrosomal microtubules. In doing so, augmin promotes kinetochore and interpolar microtubule turnover and poleward flux. Tracking of microtubule growth events within individual k-fibers reveals a wide angular dispersion, consistent with augmin-mediated branched microtubule nucleation. Augmin depletion reduces the frequency of kinetochore microtubule growth events and hampers efficient repair after acute k-fiber injury by laser microsurgery. Together, these findings underscore the contribution of augmin-mediated microtubule amplification for k-fiber self-organization and maturation in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 reservoir is composed of cells harboring latent proviruses that have the potential to contribute to viremia upon antiretroviral treatment (ART) interruption. While this reservoir is known to be maintained by clonal expansion of infected cells, the contribution of these cell clones to residual viremia and viral rebound remains underexplored. Here, we conducted an extensive analysis on four ART-treated individuals who underwent an analytical treatment interruption (ATI), characterizing the proviral genomes and associated integration sites of large infected clones and phylogenetically linking these to plasma viremia. We show discrepancies between different assays in their ability to assess clonal expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that proviruses could phylogenetically be linked to plasma virus obtained before or during an ATI. This study highlights a role for HIV-infected cell clones in the maintenance of the replication-competent reservoir and suggests that infected cell clones can directly contribute to rebound viremia upon ATI.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors can exert opposite effects depending on the chromosomal context. The fission yeast transcription factor Atf1 both activates numerous genes in response to stresses and mediates heterochromatic gene silencing in the mating-type region. Investigating this context dependency, we report here that the establishment of silent heterochromatin in the mating-type region occurs at a reduced rate in the absence of Atf1 binding. Quantitative modeling accounts for the observed establishment profiles by a combinatorial recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes: locally by Atf1 at two binding sites and over the whole region by dynamically appearing heterochromatic nucleosomes, a source of which is the RNAi-dependent cenH element. In the absence of Atf1 binding, the synergy is lost, resulting in a slow rate of heterochromatin formation. The system shows how DNA-binding proteins can influence local nucleosome states and thereby potentiate long-range positive feedback on histone-modification reactions to enable heterochromatin formation over large regions in a context-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a nuclear receptor critical to the regulation of energy metabolism and inflammation. The actions of GR are dependent on cell type and context. Here, we demonstrate the role of liver lineage-determining factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A) in defining liver specificity of GR action. In mouse liver, the HNF4A motif lies adjacent to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) at GR binding sites within regions of open chromatin. In the absence of HNF4A, the liver GR cistrome is remodeled, with loss and gain of GR recruitment evident. Loss of chromatin accessibility at HNF4A-marked sites associates with loss of GR binding at weak GRE motifs. GR binding and chromatin accessibility are gained at sites characterized by strong GRE motifs, which show GR recruitment in non-liver tissues. The functional importance of these HNF4A-regulated GR sites is indicated by an altered transcriptional response to glucocorticoid treatment in the Hnf4a-null liver.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of tissue curvature is essential to morphogenesis. However, how cells adapt to changing curvature is still unknown because tools to dynamically control curvature in vitro are lacking. Here, we developed self-rolling substrates to study how flat epithelial cell monolayers adapt to a rapid anisotropic change of curvature. We show that the primary response is an active and transient osmotic swelling of cells. This cell volume increase is not observed on inducible wrinkled substrates, where concave and convex regions alternate each other over short distances; and this finding identifies swelling as a collective response to changes of curvature with a persistent sign over large distances. It is triggered by a drop in membrane tension and actin depolymerization, which is perceived by cells as a hypertonic shock. Osmotic swelling restores tension while actin reorganizes, probably to comply with curvature. Thus, epithelia are unique materials that transiently and actively swell while adapting to large curvature induction.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy frequently induces immune-related adverse events. To elucidate the underlying immunobiology, we performed a deep immune analysis of intestinal, colitis, and tumor tissue from ICB-treated patients with parallel studies in preclinical models. Expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), neutrophil, and chemotactic markers was higher in colitis than in normal intestinal tissue; T helper 17 (Th17) cells were more prevalent in immune-related enterocolitis (irEC) than T helper 1 (Th1). Anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) induced stronger Th17 memory in colitis than anti-program death 1 (anti-PD-1). In murine models, IL-6 blockade associated with improved tumor control and a higher density of CD4+/CD8+ effector T cells, with reduced Th17, macrophages, and myeloid cells. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model with tumors, combined IL-6 blockade and ICB enhanced tumor rejection while simultaneously mitigating EAE symptoms versus ICB alone. IL-6 blockade with ICB could de-couple autoimmunity from antitumor immunity.

Abstract: Wnt/β-catenin, a highly conserved signaling pathway, is involved in determining cell fate. During heart development, Wnt signaling controls specification, proliferation and differentiation of cardiac cells. This study is aimed to investigate the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cardiac lineage commitment of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) after treatment with demethylating agents, zebularine and 2'-deoxycytidine (2-DC). hUCMSCs were treated with 20 µM zebularine or 2-DC for 24 h and cultured for 14 days. Control and treated MSCs were analyzed for cardiac lineage commitment at gene and protein levels. Significant upregulation of early and late cardiac markers, GATA4, Nkx2.5, cardiac myosin heavy chain (cMHC), α-actinin, cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was observed in treated MSCs as compared to the untreated control. We also analyzed gene expression of key Wnt/β-catenin signaling molecules in cultures of treated and untreated hUCMSCs at 24 h, and days 3, 7 and 14. The pattern of mRNA gene expression showed that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is regulated during cardiac lineage commitment of hUCMSCs in a time-dependent manner, with the pathway being activated early but inhibited later in cardiac development. Findings of this study can lead us to identify more specific and effective strategies for cardiac lineage commitment.
