Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb-group (PcG) repressive complex-1 (PRC1) forms microscopically visible clusters in nuclei; however, the impact of this cluster formation on transcriptional regulation and the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process remain obscure. Here, we report that the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of a PRC1 core component Phc2 plays an essential role for PRC1 clustering through head-to-tail macromolecular polymerization, which is associated with stable target binding of PRC1/PRC2 and robust gene silencing activity. We propose a role for SAM domain polymerization in this repression by two distinct mechanisms: first, through capturing and/or retaining PRC1 at the PcG targets, and second, by strengthening the interactions between PRC1 and PRC2 to stabilize transcriptional repression. Our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism mediated by SAM domain polymerization for PcG-mediated repression of developmental loci that enables a robust yet reversible gene repression program during development.

Highly Complementary Target RNAs Promote Release of Guide RNAs from Human Argonaute2,

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute proteins use small RNAs to guide the silencing of complementary target RNAs in many eukaryotes. Although small RNA biogenesis pathways are well studied, mechanisms for removal of guide RNAs from Argonaute are poorly understood. Here we show that the Argonaute2 (Ago2) guide RNA complex is extremely stable, with a half-life on the order of days. However, highly complementary target RNAs destabilize the complex and significantly accelerate release of the guide RNA from Ago2. This “unloading” activity can be enhanced by mismatches between the target and the guide 5′ end and attenuated by mismatches to the guide 3′ end. The introduction of 3′ mismatches leads to more potent silencing of abundant mRNAs in mammalian cells. These findings help to explain why the 3′ ends of mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) rarely match their targets, suggest a mechanism for sequence-specific small RNA turnover, and offer insights for controlling small RNAs in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins are at the heart of posttranscriptional gene regulation, coordinating the processing, storage, and handling of cellular RNAs. We show here that GRSF1, previously implicated in the binding and selective translation of influenza mRNAs, is targeted to mitochondria where it forms granules that colocalize with foci of newly synthesized mtRNA next to mitochondrial nucleoids. GRSF1 preferentially binds RNAs transcribed from three contiguous genes on the light strand of mtDNA, the ND6 mRNA, and the long noncoding RNAs for cytb and ND5, each of which contains multiple consensus binding sequences. RNAi-mediated knockdown of GRSF1 leads to alterations in mitochondrial RNA stability, abnormal loading of mRNAs and lncRNAs on the mitochondrial ribosome, and impaired ribosome assembly. This results in a specific protein synthesis defect and a failure to assemble normal amounts of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. These data implicate GRSF1 as a key regulator of posttranscriptional mitochondrial gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Planarian regeneration depends on the presence of pluripotent stem cells in the adult. We developed an in vivo stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) protocol in planarians to identify proteins that are enriched in planarian stem cells. Through a comparison of SILAC proteomes of normal and stem cell-depleted planarians and of a stem cell-enriched population of sorted cells, we identified hundreds of stem cell proteins. One of these is an ortholog of nuclear receptor coactivator-5 (Ncoa5/CIA), which is known to regulate estrogen-receptor-mediated transcription in human cells. We show that Ncoa5 is essential for the maintenance of the pluripotent stem cell population in planarians and that a putative mouse ortholog is expressed in pluripotent cells of the embryo. Our study thus identifies a conserved component of pluripotent stem cells, demonstrating that planarians, in particular, when combined with in vivo SILAC, are a powerful model in stem cell research.

Abstract: Summary
The EZH2 histone methyltransferase is highly expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells and targeted by somatic mutations in B cell lymphomas. Here, we find that EZH2 deletion or pharmacologic inhibition suppresses GC formation and functions. EZH2 represses proliferation checkpoint genes and helps establish bivalent chromatin domains at key regulatory loci to transiently suppress GC B cell differentiation. Somatic mutations reinforce these physiological effects through enhanced silencing of EZH2 targets. Conditional expression of mutant EZH2 in mice induces GC hyperplasia and accelerated lymphomagenesis in cooperation with BCL2. GC B cell (GCB)-type diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are mostly addicted to EZH2 but not the more differentiated activated B cell (ABC)-type DLBCLs, thus clarifying the therapeutic scope of EZH2 targeting.

Abstract: Summary
Recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) into avascular areas sustains tumor progression; however, the underlying guidance mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia-induced Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) acts as an attractant for TAMs by triggering vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 phosphorylation through the associated holoreceptor, composed of Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and PlexinA1/PlexinA4. Importantly, whereas Nrp1 levels are downregulated in the hypoxic environment, Sema3A continues to regulate TAMs in an Nrp1-independent manner by eliciting PlexinA1/PlexinA4-mediated stop signals, which retain them inside the hypoxic niche. Consistently, gene deletion of Nrp1 in macrophages favors TAMs’ entrapment in normoxic tumor regions, which abates their pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive functions, hence inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. This study shows that TAMs’ heterogeneity depends on their localization, which is tightly controlled by Sema3A/Nrp1 signaling.

Abstract: Embryonic stem (ES) cells can be valuable for monitoring differentiation processes and for improving applications in basic developmental biology. The application of ES cells can be a useful tool for drug discovery and toxicology. Therefore, we suggest the high-throughput screening (HTS) system based on ES cells in this study. Firstly, we optimized the feeder-free condition and seeding cell number which can maintained for at least 7 days without over-confluency. We analyzed the system by cell viability, proliferation activity, RT-PCR and morphologic/immunohistochemical evaluations. The optimal cell seeding number was 30/well that was maintained the typical colonial morphology over 9 d with 1,000 U/ml LIF in the limited space. The cell in optimized condition expressed ALP, SSEA-1, Oct 4 and Nanog and the genetic expressions showed similar to protein expressions. The cell lineage marker expressions showed faint or none. The cell viability and proliferation activity were increased in time-dependent manner in our optimized HTS system. In conclusion, the novel HTS system using ES cells can by useful for developing models for drug discovery as well as toxicological screening in the near future.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription activation of some yeast genes correlates with their repositioning to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC-bound Mlp1 and Mlp2 proteins have been shown to associate with the GAL1 gene promoter and to maintain Ulp1, a key SUMO protease, at the NPC. Here, we show that the release of Ulp1 from the NPC increases the kinetics of GAL1 derepression, whereas artificial NPC anchoring of Ulp1 in the Δmlp1/2 strain restores normal GAL1 regulation. Moreover, artificial tethering of the Ulp1 catalytic domain to the GAL1 locus enhances the derepression kinetics. Our results also indicate that Ulp1 modulates the sumoylation state of Tup1 and Ssn6, two regulators of glucose-repressed genes, and that a loss of Ssn6 sumoylation correlates with an increase in GAL1 derepression kinetics. Altogether, our data highlight a role for the NPC-associated SUMO protease Ulp1 in regulating the sumoylation of gene-bound transcription regulators, positively affecting transcription kinetics in the context of the NPC.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) plays an important but ill-defined role in VEGF-A signaling and vascular morphogenesis. We show that mice with a knockin mutation that ablates the NRP1 cytoplasmic tail (Nrp1cyto) have normal angiogenesis but impaired developmental and adult arteriogenesis. The arteriogenic defect was traced to the absence of a PDZ-dependent interaction between NRP1 and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) complex and synectin, which delayed trafficking of endocytosed VEGFR2 from Rab5+ to EAA1+ endosomes. This led to increased PTPN1 (PTP1b)-mediated dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Y1175, the site involved in activating ERK signaling. The Nrp1cyto mutation also impaired endothelial tubulogenesis in vitro, which could be rescued by expressing full-length NRP1 or constitutively active ERK. These results demonstrate that the NRP1 cytoplasmic domain promotes VEGFR2 trafficking in a PDZ-dependent manner to regulate arteriogenic ERK signaling and establish a role for NRP1 in VEGF-A signaling during vascular morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neuroendocrine cancer that originates from calcitonin-secreting parafollicular cells, or C cells. We found that Cdk5 and its cofactors p35 and p25 are highly expressed in human MTC and that Cdk5 activity promotes MTC proliferation. A conditional MTC mouse model was generated and corroborated the role of aberrant Cdk5 activation in MTC. C cell-specific overexpression of p25 caused rapid C cell hyperplasia leading to lethal MTC, which was arrested by repressing p25 overexpression. A comparative phosphoproteomic screen between proliferating and arrested MTC identified the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) as a crucial Cdk5 downstream target. Prevention of Rb phosphorylation at Ser807/Ser811 attenuated MTC proliferation. These findings implicate Cdk5 signaling via Rb as critical to MTC tumorigenesis and progression.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated in human cancer. Common mutant p53 (mutp53) isoforms can actively promote cancer through gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms. We report that mutp53 prolongs TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in cultured cells and intestinal organoid cultures. Remarkably, when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium, mice harboring a germline p53 mutation develop severe chronic inflammation and persistent tissue damage, and are highly prone to inflammation-associated colon cancer. This mutp53 GOF is manifested by rapid onset of flat dysplastic lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma with mutp53 accumulation and augmented NF-κB activation, faithfully recapitulating features frequently observed in human colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). These findings might explain the early appearance of p53 mutations in human CAC.

Abstract: Summary
Meiotic recombination, crucial for proper chromosome segregation and genome evolution, is initiated by programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in yeasts and likely all sexually reproducing species. In fission yeast, DSBs occur up to hundreds of times more frequently at special sites, called hot spots, than in other regions of the genome. What distinguishes hot spots from cold regions is an unsolved problem, although transcription factors determine some hot spots. We report the discovery that three coiled-coil proteins—Rec25, Rec27, and Mug20—bind essentially all hot spots with great specificity even without DSB formation. These small proteins are components of linear elements, are related to synaptonemal complex proteins, and are essential for nearly all DSBs at most hot spots. Our results indicate these hot spot determinants activate or stabilize the DSB-forming protein Rec12 (Spo11 homolog) rather than promote its binding to hot spots. We propose a paradigm for hot spot determination and crossover control by linear element proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Cell plasticity or potency is necessary for the formation of multiple cell types. The mechanisms underlying this plasticity are largely unknown. Preimplantation mouse embryos undergo drastic changes in cellular potency, starting with the totipotent zygote through to the formation of the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) and differentiated trophectoderm in the blastocyst. Here, we set out to identify and functionally characterize chromatin modifiers that define the transitions of potency and cell fate in the mouse embryo. Using a quantitative microfluidics approach in single cells, we show that developmental transitions are marked by distinctive combinatorial profiles of epigenetic modifiers. Pluripotent cells of the ICM are distinct from their differentiated trophectoderm counterparts. We show that PRDM14 is heterogeneously expressed in 4-cell-stage embryos. Forced expression of PRDM14 at the 2-cell stage leads to increased H3R26me2 and can induce a pluripotent ICM fate. Our results shed light on the epigenetic networks that govern cellular potency and identity in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
While the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis in cell pathophysiology is widely accepted, the possibility that cAMP regulates mitochondrial functions has only recently received experimental support. The site of cAMP production, its targets, and its functions in the organelles remain uncertain. Using a variety of genetic/pharmacological tools, we here demonstrate that the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to cytosolic cAMP, while an autonomous cAMP signaling toolkit is expressed in the matrix. We demonstrate that rises in matrix Ca2+ powerfully stimulate cAMP increases within mitochondria and that matrix cAMP levels regulate their ATP synthesizing efficiency. In cardiomyocyte cultures, mitochondrial cAMP can be increased by treatments that augment the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations within the cytosol and organelles, revealing that mitochondria can integrate an oscillatory Ca2+ signal to increase cAMP in their matrix. The present data reveal the existence, within mitochondria, of a hitherto unknown crosstalk between Ca2+ and cAMP.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) attachment to primary B cells initiates virus entry. Although CD21 is the only known receptor for EBVgp350/220, a recent report documents EBV-infected B cells from a patient genetically deficient in CD21. On normal resting B cells, CD21 forms two membrane complexes: one with CD19 and another with CD35. Whereas the CD21/CD19 complex is widely retained on immortalized and B cell tumor lines, the related complement-regulatory protein CD35 is lost. To determine the role(s) of CD35 in initial infection, we transduced a CD21-negative pre-B cell and myeloid leukemia line with CD35, CD21, or both. Cells expressing CD35 alone bound gp350/220 and became latently infected when the fusion receptor HLA II was coexpressed. Temporal, biophysical, and structural characteristics of CD35-mediated infection were distinct from CD21. Identification of CD35 as an EBV receptor uncovers a salient role in primary infection, addresses unsettled questions of virus tropism, and underscores the importance of EBVgp350/220 for vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
To elucidate the structural basis of the mechanism of microtubule depolymerization by kinesin-13s, we analyzed complexes of tubulin and the Drosophila melanogaster kinesin-13 KLP10A by electron microscopy (EM) and fluorescence polarization microscopy. We report a nanometer-resolution (1.1 nm) cryo-EM three-dimensional structure of the KLP10A head domain (KLP10AHD) bound to curved tubulin. We found that binding of KLP10AHD induces a distinct tubulin configuration with displacement (shear) between tubulin subunits in addition to curvature. In this configuration, the kinesin-binding site differs from that in straight tubulin, providing an explanation for the distinct interaction modes of kinesin-13s with the microtubule lattice or its ends. The KLP10AHD-tubulin interface comprises three areas of interaction, suggesting a crossbow-type tubulin-bending mechanism. These areas include the kinesin-13 family conserved KVD residues, and as predicted from the crossbow model, mutating these residues changes the orientation and mobility of KLP10AHDs interacting with the microtubule.

Abstract: Summary
RAS proteins directly activate PI3-kinases. Mice bearing a germline mutation in the RAS binding domain of the p110α subunit of PI3-kinse are resistant to the development of RAS-driven tumors. However, it is unknown whether interaction of RAS with PI3-kinase is required in established tumors. The need for RAS interaction with p110α in the maintenance of mutant Kras-driven lung tumors was explored using an inducible mouse model. In established tumors, removal of the ability of p110α to interact with RAS causes long-term tumor stasis and partial regression. This is a tumor cell-autonomous effect, which is improved significantly by combination with MEK inhibition. Total removal of p110α expression or activity has comparable effects, albeit with greater toxicities.

Abstract: Many solid tumor cells exhibit mitochondrial respiratory impairment; however, the mechanisms of such impairment in cancer development remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SNU human hepatoma cells with declined mitochondrial respiratory activity showed decreased expression of mitochondrial 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/ lyase (mtOGG1), a mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme; similar results were obtained with human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Among several OGG1-2 variants with a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (OGG1-2a, -2b, -2c, -2d, and -2e), OGG1-2a was the major mitochondrial isoform in all examined hepatoma cells. Interestingly, hepatoma cells with low mtOGG1 levels showed delayed cell growth and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Knockdown of OGG1-2 isoforms in Chang-L cells, which have active mitochondrial respiration with high mtOGG1 levels, significantly decreased cellular respiration and cell growth, and increased intracellular ROS. Overexpression of OGG1-2a in SNU423 cells, which have low mtOGG1 levels, effectively recovered cellular respiration and cell growth activities, and decreased intracellular ROS. Taken together, our results suggest that mtOGG1 plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial respiration, thereby contributing to cell growth of hepatoma cells.

Abstract: Summary
Aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is a core hallmark of cancer, but the molecular mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. Here, we identify an unexpected central role for mTORC2 in cancer metabolic reprogramming where it controls glycolytic metabolism by ultimately regulating the cellular level of c-Myc. We show that mTORC2 promotes inactivating phosphorylation of class IIa histone deacetylases, which leads to the acetylation of FoxO1 and FoxO3, and this in turn releases c-Myc from a suppressive miR-34c-dependent network. These central features of activated mTORC2 signaling, acetylated FoxO, and c-Myc levels are highly intercorrelated in clinical samples and with shorter survival of GBM patients. These results identify a specific, Akt-independent role for mTORC2 in regulating glycolytic metabolism in cancer.

Abstract: To avoid host immune surveillance, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encoded endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane glycoprotein US2, which interferes with antigen presenting mechanism of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ia and class II molecules. However, not many attempts have been made to study the effect of HCMV US2 on the expression of MHC class Ib molecules. In this study, we examined the effect of HCMV US2 on the expression and function of human CD1d (hCD1d), which presents glycolipid antigens to invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. Our results clearly showed that the physiological interaction between ER lumenal domain of HCMV US2 and α3 domain of hCD1d was observed within ER. Compared with mature form of hCD1d, immature form of hCD1d is more susceptible to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation mediated by HCMV US2. Moreover, the ectopic expression of HCMV US2 leads to the down-modulation of iNKT cell activity without significant change of hCD1d expression. These results will advance our understanding of the function of HCMV US2 in immune evasive mechanisms against anti-viral immunity of iNKT cells.

Abstract: Summary
The incidence of cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) is increasing worldwide. Using a transgenic mouse model, we found that expression of the intracellular domain of Notch 1 (NICD) in mouse livers results in the formation of intrahepatic CCCs. These tumors display features of bipotential hepatic progenitor cells, indicating that intrahepatic CCC can originate from this cell type. We show that human and mouse CCCs are characterized by high expression of the cyclin E protein and identified the cyclin E gene as a direct transcriptional target of the Notch signaling pathway. Intriguingly, blocking γ-secretase activity in human CCC xenotransplants results in downregulation of cyclin E expression, induction of apoptosis, and tumor remission in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cells acquire cholesterol, a major membrane constituent, via low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. However, the mechanisms by which LDL cholesterol reaches the plasma membrane (PM) have remained obscure. Here, we applied LDL labeled with BODIPY cholesteryl linoleate to identify this pathway in living cells. The egress of BODIPY cholesterol (BC) from late endosomal (LE) organelles was dependent on acid lipase and Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, as for natural cholesterol. We show that NPC1 was needed to recruit Rab8a to BC-containing LEs, and Rab8a enhanced the motility and segregation of BC- and CD63-positive organelles from lysosomes. The BC carriers docked to the cortical actin by a Rab8a- and Myosin5b (Myo5b)-dependent mechanism, typically in the proximity of focal adhesions (FAs). LDL increased the number and dynamics of FAs and stimulated cell migration in an acid lipase, NPC1, and Rab8a-dependent fashion, providing evidence that this cholesterol delivery route to the PM is important for cell movement.

Abstract: Earlier studies have shown that activation of adenosine A1 receptors on peripheral pain fibers contributes to acupuncture-induced suppression of painful input. In addition to adenosine, acupuncture triggers the release of other purines, including ATP and ADP that may bind to purine receptors on nearby fibroblasts. We here show that purine agonists trigger increase in cytosolic Ca2+ signaling in a cultured human fibroblasts cell line. The profile of agonist-induced Ca2+ increases indicates that the cells express functional P2yR2 and P2yR4 receptors, as well as P2yR1 and P2xR7 receptors. Unexpectedly, purine-induced Ca2+ signaling was associated with a remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. ATP induced a transient loss in F-actin stress fiber. The changes of actin cytoskeleton occurred slowly and peaked at 10min after agonist exposure. Inhibition of ATP-induced increases in Ca2+ by cyclopiazonic acid blocked receptor-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling. The Ca2+ ionophore failed to induce cytoskeletal remodeling despite triggering robust increases in cytosolic Ca2+. These observations indicate that purine signaling induces transient changes in fibroblast cytoarchitecture that could be related to the beneficial effects of acupuncture.

Abstract: Summary
Using high-resolution live imaging in zebrafish, we show that presumptive eye cells acquire apicobasal polarity and adopt neuroepithelial character prior to other regions of the neural plate. Neuroepithelial organization is first apparent at the margin of the eye field, whereas cells at its core have mesenchymal morphology. These core cells subsequently intercalate between the marginal cells contributing to the bilateral expansion of the optic vesicles. During later evagination, optic vesicle cells shorten, drawing their apical surfaces laterally relative to the basal lamina, resulting in further laterally directed evagination. The early neuroepithelial organization of the eye field requires Laminin1, and ectopic Laminin1 can redirect the apicobasal orientation of eye field cells. Furthermore, disrupting cell polarity through combined abrogation of the polarity protein Pard6γb and Laminin1 severely compromises optic vesicle evagination. Our studies elucidate the cellular events underlying early eye morphogenesis and provide a framework for understanding epithelialization and complex tissue formation.

Abstract: Summary
Quality control of defective mRNAs relies on their translation to detect the lesion. Aberrant proteins are therefore an obligate byproduct of mRNA surveillance and must be degraded to avoid disrupting protein homeostasis. These defective translation products are thought to be ubiquitinated at the ribosome, but the mechanism of ubiquitin ligase selectivity for these ribosomes is not clear. Here, we in vitro reconstitute ubiquitination of nascent proteins produced from aberrant mRNAs. Stalled 80S ribosome-nascent chain complexes are dissociated by the ribosome recycling factors Hbs1/Pelota/ABCE1 to a unique 60S-nascent chain-tRNA complex. The ubiquitin ligase Listerin preferentially recognizes 60S-nascent chains and triggers efficient nascent chain ubiquitination. Interfering with Hbs1 function stabilizes 80S complexes, precludes efficient Listerin recruitment, and reduces nascent chain ubiquitination. Thus, ribosome recycling factors control Listerin localization, explaining how translation products of mRNA surveillance are efficiently ubiquitinated while sparing translating ribosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of DAF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1] receptor) or RSKS-1 (S6K), key molecules in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways, respectively, extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, it has not been clear how and in which tissues they interact with each other to modulate longevity. Here, we demonstrate that a combination of mutations in daf-2 and rsks-1 produces a nearly 5-fold increase in longevity that is much greater than the sum of single mutations. This synergistic lifespan extension requires positive feedback regulation of DAF-16 (FOXO) via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex. Furthermore, we identify germline as the key tissue for this synergistic longevity. Moreover, germline-specific inhibition of rsks-1 activates DAF-16 in the intestine. Together, our findings highlight the importance of the germline in the significantly increased longevity produced by daf-2 rsks-1, which has important implications for interactions between the two major conserved longevity pathways in more complex organisms.

Abstract: The scorpion toxin maurocalcine acts as a high affinity agonist of the type-1 ryanodine receptor expressed in skeletal muscle. Here, we investigated the effects of the reducing agent dithiothreitol or the oxidizing reagent thimerosal on type-1 ryanodine receptor stimulation by maurocalcine. Maurocalcine addition to sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles actively loaded with calcium elicited Ca2+ release from native vesicles and from vesicles pre-incubated with dithiothreitol; thimerosal addition to native vesicles after Ca2+ uptake completion prevented this response. Maurocalcine enhanced equilibrium [3H]-ryanodine binding to native and to dithiothreitol-treated reticulum vesicles, and increased 5-fold the apparent Ki for Mg2+ inhibition of [3H]-ryanodine binding to native vesicles. Single calcium release channels incorporated in planar lipid bilayers displayed a long-lived open sub-conductance state after maurocalcine addition. The fractional time spent in this sub-conductance state decreased when lowering cytoplasmic [Ca2+] from 10μM to 0.1μM or at cytoplasmic [Mg2+]≥30μM. At 0.1μM [Ca2+], only channels that displayed poor activation by Ca2+ were readily activated by 5nM maurocalcine; subsequent incubation with thimerosal abolished the sub-conductance state induced by maurocalcine. We interpret these results as an indication that maurocalcine acts as a more effective type-1 ryanodine receptor channel agonist under reducing conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Wip1 phosphatase is emerging as an important regulator of tumorigenesis, but no unifying mechanistic network has been proposed. We found that Wip1 plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of heterochromatin-associated DNA sequences. Wip1 was required for epigenetic remodeling of repetitive DNA elements through regulation of BRCA1 interaction with HP1, the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases, and subsequent DNA methylation. Attenuation of ATM, in turn, reversed heterochromatin methylation. This mechanism was critical for the recruitment of the AID cytidine deaminase, and Wip1 levels strongly correlated with C-to-T substitutions and a total mutation load in primary breast cancers. We propose that Wip1 plays an important role in the regulation of global heterochromatin silencing and thus is critical in maintaining genome integrity.

Abstract: Astrocytes are considered essential in the etiopathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have demonstrated previously that immunoglobulins G (IgG) isolated from patients with ALS enhance the mobility of acidic vesicles in cultured astrocytes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Here we directly examined the impact of purified sporadic ALS IgG on cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) in astrocytes. Confocal time-lapse images were acquired and fluorescence of a non-ratiometric Ca2+ indicator was recorded before and after the application of IgG. ALS IgG (0.1mg/ml) from 7 patients evoked transient increases in [Ca2+]i in ~50% of tested astrocytes. The probability of observing a response was independent of extracellular Ca2+. The peak increase in [Ca2+]i developed ~3 times faster and the time integral of evoked transients was ~2-fold larger; the peak amplitude itself was not affected by extracellular Ca2+. Application of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that activation of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors is necessary and sufficient to initiate transients in [Ca2+]i; the Ca2+ influx through store-operated calcium entry prolongs the transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Thus, ALS IgG acutely affect [Ca2+]i by mobilizing both, intra- and extracellular Ca2+ into the cytosol of cultured astrocytes.

Abstract: Chaperonins are involved in protein-folding. The rice genome encodes six plastid chaperonin subunits (Cpn60)-three α and three β. Our study showed that they were differentially expressed during normal plant development. Moreover, five were induced by heat stress (42°C) but not by cold (10°C). The oscpn60α1 mutant had a pale-green phenotype at the seedling stage and development ceased after the fourth leaf appeared. Transiently expressed OsCpn60α1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the chloroplast stroma. Immuno-blot analysis indicated that the level of Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) was severely reduced in the mutant while levels were unchanged for some imported proteins, e.g., stromal heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1 (Lhcb1). This demonstrated that OsCpn60α1 is required for the folding of rbcL and that failure of that process is seedling-lethal.

Abstract: The hyaloid vessel is a transient vascular network that nourishes the lens and the primary vitreous in the early developmental periods. In hyaloid vessels devoid of the support of astrocytes, we demonstrate that tight junction proteins, zonula occludens-1 and occludin, are regularly expressed at the junction of endothelial cells. To figure out the factor influencing the formation of tight junctions in hyaloid vessels, we further progress to investigate the interactions between endothelial cells and pericytes, two representative constituent cells in hyaloid vessels. Interestingly, endothelial cells interact with pericytes in the early postnatal periods and the interaction between two cell types provokes the up-regulation of transforming growth factor β1. Further in vitro experiments demonstrate that transforming growth factor β1 induces the activation of Smad2 and Smad3 and the formation of tight junction proteins. Taken together, in hyaloid vessels, pericytes seem to regulate the formation of tight junctions by the interaction with endothelial cells even without the support of astrocytes. Additionally, we suggest that the hyaloid vessel is a valuable system that can be utilized for the investigation of cell-cell interaction in the formation of tight junctions in developing vasculatures.

Abstract: Summary
Despite a wealth of clinical data showing an association between inflammation and degenerative disorders in the elderly, the immune sensors that causally link systemic inflammation to aging remain unclear. Here we detail a mechanism by which the Nlrp3 inflammasome controls systemic low-grade age-related “sterile” inflammation in both periphery and brain independently of the noncanonical caspase-11 inflammasome. Ablation of Nlrp3 inflammasome protected mice from age-related increases in the innate immune activation, alterations in CNS transcriptome, and astrogliosis. Consistent with the hypothesis that systemic low-grade inflammation promotes age-related degenerative changes, the deficient Nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activity improved glycemic control and attenuated bone loss and thymic demise. Notably, IL-1 mediated only Nlrp3 inflammasome-dependent improvement in cognitive function and motor performance in aged mice. These studies reveal Nlrp3 inflammasome as an upstream target that controls age-related inflammation and offer an innovative therapeutic strategy to lower Nlrp3 activity to delay multiple age-related chronic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The global regulatory nucleotide ppGpp (“magic spot”) regulates transcription from a large subset of Escherichia coli promoters, illustrating how small molecules can control gene expression promoter—specifically by interacting with RNA polymerase (RNAP) without binding to DNA. However, ppGpp’s target site on RNAP, and therefore its mechanism of action, has remained unclear. We report here a binding site for ppGpp on E. coli RNAP, identified by crosslinking, protease mapping, and analysis of mutant RNAPs that fail to respond to ppGpp. A strain with a mutant ppGpp binding site displays properties characteristic of cells defective for ppGpp synthesis. The binding site is at an interface of two RNAP subunits, ω and β′, and its position suggests an allosteric mechanism of action involving restriction of motion between two mobile RNAP modules. Identification of the binding site allows prediction of bacterial species in which ppGpp exerts its effects by targeting RNAP.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue morphogenesis involves both the sculpting of tissue shape and the positioning of tissues relative to one another in the body. Using the renal tubules of Drosophila, we show that a specific distal tubule cell regulates both tissue architecture and position in the body cavity. Focusing on the anterior tubules, we demonstrate that tip cells make transient contacts with alary muscles at abdominal segment boundaries, moving progressively forward as convergent extension movements lengthen the tubule. Tip cell anchorage antagonizes forward-directed, TGF-β-guided tubule elongation, thereby ensuring the looped morphology characteristic of renal tubules from worms to humans. Distinctive tip cell exploratory behavior, adhesion, and basement membrane clearing underlie target recognition and dynamic interactions. Defects in these features obliterate tip cell anchorage, producing misshapen and misplaced tubules with impaired physiological function.

Abstract: Summary
To survive adverse and ever-changing environmental conditions, an organism must be able to adapt. It has long been established that the cellular reaction to stress includes the upregulation of genes coding for specific stress-responsive factors. In the present study, we demonstrate that during the early steps of the heat stress response, 25% of the Arabidopsis seedling transcriptome is targeted for rapid degradation. Our findings demonstrate that this process is catalyzed from 5′ to 3′ by the cytoplasmic exoribonuclease XRN4, whose function is seemingly reprogrammed by the heat-sensing pathway. The bulk of mRNAs subject to heat-dependent degradation are likely to include both the ribosome-released and polysome associated polyadenylated pools. The cotranslational decay process is facilitated at least in part by LARP1, a heat-specific cofactor of XRN4 required for its targeting to polysomes. Commensurate with their respective involvement at the molecular level, LARP1 and XRN4 are necessary for the thermotolerance of plants to long exposure to moderately high temperature, with xrn4 null mutants being almost unable to survive. These findings provide mechanistic insights regarding a massive stress-induced posttranscriptional downregulation and outline a potentially crucial pathway for plant survival and acclimation to heat stress.

Abstract: Summary
Exportin5 mediates the nuclear export of double-stranded RNAs, including pre-microRNAs, adenoviral RNAs, and tRNAs. When tRNAs are aminoacylated, the Exportin5-aminoacyl (aa)-tRNA complex recruits and coexports the translation elongation factor eEF1A. Here, we show that eEF1A binds to Snail transcription factors when bound to their main target, the E-cadherin promoter, facilitating their export to the cytoplasm in association with the aa-tRNA-Exportin5 complex. Snail binds to eEF1A through the SNAG domain, a protein nuclear export signal present in several transcription factor families, and this binding is regulated by phosphorylation. Thus, we describe a nuclear role for eEF1A and provide a mechanism for protein nuclear export that attenuates the activity of SNAG-containing transcription factors.

Abstract: Cdc25B is an essential regulator for meiotic resumption in mouse oocytes. However, the role of this phosphatase during the later stage of the meiotic cell cycle is not known. In this study, we investigated the role of Cdc25B during metaphase II (MII) arrest in mouse oocytes. Cdc25B was extensively phosphorylated during MII arrest with an increase in the phosphatase activity toward Cdk1. Downregulation of Cdc25B by antibody injection induced the formation of a pronucleus-like structure. Conversely, overexpression of Cdc25B inhibited Ca2+-mediated release from MII arrest. Moreover, Cdc25B was immediately dephosphorylated and hence inactivated during MII exit, suggesting that Cdk1 phosphorylation is required to exit from MII arrest. Interestingly, this inactivation occurred prior to cyclin B degradation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that MII arrest in mouse oocytes is tightly regulated not only by the proteolytic degradation of cyclin B but also by dynamic phosphorylation of Cdk1.

Abstract: Summary
Sorting of endocytic ligands and receptors is critical for diverse cellular processes. The physiological significance of endosomal sorting proteins in vertebrates, however, remains largely unknown. Here we report that sorting nexin 3 (Snx3) facilitates the recycling of transferrin receptor (Tfrc) and thus is required for the proper delivery of iron to erythroid progenitors. Snx3 is highly expressed in vertebrate hematopoietic tissues. Silencing of Snx3 results in anemia and hemoglobin defects in vertebrates due to impaired transferrin (Tf)-mediated iron uptake and its accumulation in early endosomes. This impaired iron assimilation can be complemented with non-Tf iron chelates. We show that Snx3 and Vps35, a component of the retromer, interact with Tfrc to sort it to the recycling endosomes. Our findings uncover a role of Snx3 in regulating Tfrc recycling, iron homeostasis, and erythropoiesis. Thus, the identification of Snx3 provides a genetic tool for exploring erythropoiesis and disorders of iron metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) is central to the phospholipid biosynthesis pathways in cells. A prevailing view is that only one CDP-DAG synthase named Cds1 is present in both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) and mediates generation of CDP-DAG from phosphatidic acid (PA) and CTP. However, we demonstrate here by using yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism that Cds1 resides in the ER but not in mitochondria, and that Tam41, a highly conserved mitochondrial maintenance protein, directly catalyzes the formation of CDP-DAG from PA in the mitochondrial IM. We also find that inositol depletion by overexpressing an arrestin-related protein Art5 partially restores the defects of cell growth and CL synthesis in the absence of Tam41. The present findings unveil the missing step of the cardiolipin synthesis pathway in mitochondria as well as the flexibile regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis to respond to compromised CDP-DAG synthesis in mitochondria.

Abstract: The previous identification of 21 proteins in the digital setae transcriptome of Gekko gecko, 2 alpha-keratins of 52–53kDa and 19 beta-proteins (beta-keratins) of 10–21kDa, has indicated that most of setal corneous proteins are cysteine-rich. The production of specific antibodies for two of the main beta-protein subfamilies expressed in gecko setae has allowed the ultrastructural localization of two beta-proteins indicated as Ge-cprp-9 (cysteine-rich) and Ge-gprp-6 (glycine-rich). Only Ge-cprp-9, representing most of the 16 cysteine-rich beta-proteins, is present in the oberhautchen, setae and in the terminal spatula where adhesion takes place, supporting the previous expression study. Instead, the glycine-rich beta-proteins (Ge-gprp-6), representing the 3 glycine-rich beta-proteins of digital epidermis is only present in the stiff beta-layer of the digital scales and in the thin beta layer of the pad lamella sustaining the setae. Ge-cprp-9 is representative for most of the remaining 15 cys-rich proteins (Ge-cprp 1–16) and may have a structural and functional role in the process of adhesion. Most of the cysteine-rich setal proteins have a net positive charge and it is here hypothesized that these proteins may induce the formation of dipoles at the surface interface between the spatula and the substrate, enhancing the van der Waals forces and therefore adhesion to the substrate. The selection and improvement of these proteins during the evolution of geckos may have represented a successful factor for the survival and ecological adaptations of these climbing lizards.

Abstract: The Malpighian tubules of adult flesh fly, Sarcophaga ruficornis consist of principal and stellate cells. The principal cells reveal all the characteristics of transporting epithelia with well developed deep basal membrane infoldings forming a complex of interconnecting labyrinth of canaliculi and luminal microvilli, both of which are associated with mitochondria. The central cytoplasm of the cells contains a well developed nucleus, clear vacuoles or vacuoles filled with secretory material, mineral concretions or spherocrystals, lysosomes and a network of endoplasmic reticulum. The mineral concretions are also observed in the region of luminal microvilli and in the lumen of the tubule suggesting their extrusion into the lumen by exocytosis. Several formed bodies are also observed in the lumen. Stellate cells are characterized by simple membrane infoldings and luminal microvilli devoid of mitochondria. The cells are separated by septate junctions. The Malpighian tubules are richly supplied by tracheae and muscle fibers.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence is an important tumor-suppressing defense mechanism. However, relatively little is known about the signaling pathway mediating the senescence response. Here, we demonstrate that a multifunctional acetyltransferase, Tip60, plays an essential role in oncogenic ras-induced senescence. Further investigation reveals a cascade of posttranslational modifications involving p38, Tip60, and PRAK, three proteins that are essential for ras-induced senescence. Upon activation by ras, p38 induces the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 through phosphorylation of Thr158; activated Tip60 in turn directly interacts with and induces the protein kinase activity of PRAK through acetylation of K364 in a manner that depends on phosphorylation of both Tip60 and PRAK by p38. These posttranslational modifications are critical for the prosenescent function of Tip60 and PRAK, respectively. These results have defined a signaling pathway that mediates oncogene-induced senescence, and identified posttranslational modifications that regulate the enzymatic activity and biological functions of Tip60 and PRAK.

Abstract: Summary
Cells regulate adhesion in response to internally generated and externally applied forces. Integrins connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton and provide cells with mechanical anchorages and signaling platforms. Here we show that cyclic forces applied to a fibronectin–integrin α5β1 bond switch the bond from a short-lived state with 1 s lifetime to a long-lived state with 100 s lifetime. We term this phenomenon “cyclic mechanical reinforcement,” as the bond strength remembers the history of force application and accumulates over repeated cycles, but does not require force to be sustained. Cyclic mechanical reinforcement strengthens the fibronectin–integrin α5β1 bond through the RGD binding site of the ligand with the synergy binding site greatly facilitating the process. A flexible integrin hybrid domain is also important for cyclic mechanical reinforcement. Our results reveal a mechanical regulation of receptor–ligand interactions and identify a molecular mechanism for cell adhesion strengthening by cyclic forces.

Abstract: We previously reported that OsERG1 and OsERG3 encode rice small C2-domain proteins with different biochemical properties in Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding assays. Os-ERG1 exhibited Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, which was not observed with OsERG3. In the present study, we show that both OsERG1 and OsERG3 proteins exhibit oligomerization properties as determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation assays reveal the phosphorylation of OsERG1 and OsERG3 by a rice calcium-dependent protein kinase, OsCDPK5. Our mutation analysis on putative serine phosphorylation sites shows that the first serine (Ser) at position 41 of OsERG1 may be an essential residue for phosphorylation by OsCDPK5. Mutation of Ser41 to alanine (OsERG1S41A) and aspartate (OsERG1S41D) abolishes the ability of OsERG1 to bind phospholipids regardless of the presence or absence of Ca2+ ions. In addition, unlike the OsERG1 wild-type form, the mutant OsERG1 (S41A)::smGFP construct lost the ability to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to calcium ions or fungal elicitor. These results indicate that Ser41 may be essential for the function of OsERG1.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory axon development requires concerted actions of growth factors for the precise control of axonal outgrowth and target innervation. How developing sensory neurons integrate different cues is poorly understood. We demonstrate here that Smad1 activation is required for neurotrophin-mediated sensory axon growth in vitro and in vivo. Through differential phosphorylation, Smad1 exerts transcriptional selectivity to regulate the expression and activity of Erk1 and Erk2—two key neurotrophin effectors. Specifically, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) signal through carboxy-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1 (pSmad1C) to induce Erk1/2 transcription for enhanced neurotrophin responsiveness. Meanwhile, neurotrophin signaling results in linker phosphorylation of Smad1 (pSmad1L), which in turn upregulates an Erk-specific dual-specificity phosphatase, Dusp6, leading to reduced pErk1/2 and constituting a negative-feedback loop for the prevention of axon overgrowth. Together, the BMP and neurotrophin pathways form a tightly regulated signaling network with a balanced ratio of Erk1/2 and pErk1/2 to direct the precise connections between sensory neurons and peripheral targets.

Abstract: Summary
Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain proteins are central regulators of many cellular processes involving membrane dynamics. BAR domains sculpt phosphoinositide-rich membranes to generate membrane protrusions or invaginations. Here, we report that, in addition to regulating membrane geometry, BAR domains can generate extremely stable lipid microdomains by “freezing” phosphoinositide dynamics. This is a general feature of BAR domains, because the yeast endocytic BAR and Fes/CIP4 homology BAR (F-BAR) domains, the inverse BAR domain of Pinkbar, and the eisosomal BAR protein Lsp1 induced phosphoinositide clustering and halted lipid diffusion, despite differences in mechanisms of membrane interactions. Lsp1 displays comparable low diffusion rates in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that BAR domain proteins also generate stable phosphoinositide microdomains in cells. These results uncover a conserved role for BAR superfamily proteins in regulating lipid dynamics within membranes. Stable microdomains induced by BAR domain scaffolds and specific lipids can generate phase boundaries and diffusion barriers, which may have profound impacts on diverse cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
Mice navigate nearby space using their vision and whiskers, and young mice learn to integrate these heterogeneous inputs in perceptual space. We found that cortical responses were depressed in the primary visual cortex of young mice after wearing a monocular prism. This depression was uniformly observed in the primary visual cortex and was eliminated by whisker trimming or lesions in the posterior parietal cortex. Compensatory visual map shifts of responses elicited via the eye that had worn the prism were also observed. As a result, cortical responses elicited via each eye were clearly separated when a visual stimulus was placed in front of the mice. A comparison of response areas before and after prism wearing indicated that the map shifts were produced by depression with spatial eccentricity. Visual map shifts based on whisker-guided cues may serve as a model for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying higher sensory integration in the mammalian brain.

Cholesterol-Responsive Metabolic Proteins Are Required for Larval Development in Caenorhabditis elegans,

Abstract: Caenorhabditis elegans, a cholesterol auxotroph, showed defects in larval development upon cholesterol starvation (CS) in a previous study. To identify cholesterol-responsive proteins likely responsible for the larval arrest upon CS, a comparative proteomic analysis was performed between C. elegans grown in normal medium supplemented with cholesterol (CN) and those grown in medium not supplemented with cholesterol (cholesterol starvation, CS). Our analysis revealed significant change (more than 2.2-fold, p< 0.05) in nine proteins upon CS. Six proteins were down-regulated [CE01270 (EEF-1A.1), CE08852 (SAMS-1), CE11068 (PMT-2), CE09015 (ACDH-1), CE12564 (R07H5.8), and CE09655 (RLA-0)], and three proteins were up-regulated [CE29645 (LEC-1), CE16576 (LEC-5), and CE01431 (NEX-1)]. RNAi phenotypes of two of the down-regulated genes, R07H5.8 (adenosine kinase) and rla-0 (ribosomal protein), in CN were similar to that of larval arrest in CS, and RNAi of a down-regulated gene, R07H5.8, in CS further enhanced the effects of CS, suggesting that downregulation of these genes is likely responsible for the larval arrest in CS. All three up-regulated genes contain putative DAF-16 binding sites and mRNA levels of these three genes were all decreased in daf-16 mutants in CN, suggesting that DAF-16 activates expression of these genes.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal accumulation of β-secretase (BACE1) in dystrophic neurites and presynaptic β-amyloid (Aβ) production contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Little, however, is known about BACE1 sorting and dynamic transport in neurons. We investigated BACE1 trafficking in hippocampal neurons using live-cell imaging and selective labeling. We report that transport vesicles containing internalized BACE1 in dendrites undergo exclusive retrograde transport toward the soma, whereas they undergo bidirectional transport in axons. Unidirectional dendritic transport requires Eps15-homology-domain-containing (EHD) 1 and 3 protein function. Furthermore, loss of EHD function compromises dynamic axonal transport and overall BACE1 levels in axons. EHD1/3 colocalize with BACE1 and APP β-C-terminal fragments in hippocampal mossy fiber terminals, and their depletion in neurons significantly attenuates Aβ levels. These results demonstrate unidirectional endocytic transport of a dendritic cargo and reveal a role for EHD proteins in neuronal BACE1 transcytosis and Aβ production, processes that are highly relevant for Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are short 21-22 nucleotide single strand RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Most microRNAs are first transcribed as long primary microRNAs and then undergo a two step-wise sequential processing to yield single-stranded mature microRNAs. It has been suggested that the loop region of primary microRNAs plays an important role in regulating microRNA biogenesis and target recognition. However, despite the fact that several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in mature microRNA sequences and are related to human diseases, it remains unclear whether and how the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the loop regions of primary microRNAs would affect the biogenesis and function of microRNAs. Herein, we provide evidence that primary microRNAs loop nucleotides control the accuracy and efficiency of microRNA processing. Accordingly, we identified 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the loop regions of human primary microRNAs using bioinformatics, and further validated three loss-of-function and one gain-of-function single nucleotide polymorphisms using dual-luciferase assays. Thus, these results reveal a critical regulatory role encoded in the loop nucleotides of primary microRNAs for microRNA processing and function.

Abstract: This study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a novel tissue-engineered three-dimensional collagen implant on healing of a large tendon-defect model, in vivo. Forty rabbits were divided into two equal groups: treated and control. A 2cm full-thickness gap was created in the left Achilles tendons of all the rabbits. To maintain the gap at the desired length (2cm), a Kessler suture was anchored within the proximal and distal ends of the remaining tendon. In the treated group a collagen implant was inserted in the gap while in the control group the gap was left unfilled. At weekly intervals the animals were examined clinically and their Achilles tendons tested bioelectrically. The hematological parameters and the serum Platelet-Derived Growth Factor of the animals were analyzed at 60 days post injury (DPI) immediately prior to euthanasia. Their injured (left) and normal contralateral Achilles tendons were harvested and examined at gross morphologic level before being subjected to biomechanical testing, and biophysical and biochemical analysis. The treated animals showed superior weight-bearing and greater physical activity than their controls. New dense tendinous tissue with a transverse diameter comparable to that of intact tendons filled the defect area of the treated tendons and had entirely replaced the collagen implant, at 60 DPI. In control lesions the defect was filled with loose areolar connective tissue similar to subcutaneous fascia. Treatment significantly improved the electrical resistance, dry matter, hydroxyproline content, water uptake and water delivery characteristics, of the healing tissue, as well as maximum load, yield load, maximum stress, yield stress and modulus of elasticity of the injured treated tendons compared to those of the control tendons (P<0.05). Use of this three-dimensional collagen implant improved the healing of large tendon defects in rabbits.

Abstract: Summary
Semaphorins and their receptors (plexins) are axon-guiding molecules that regulate the development of the nervous system during embryogenesis. Here we describe a previously unknown role of class 3 semaphorin E (Sema3E) in adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Expression of Sema3E and its receptor plexinD1 was upregulated in the adipose tissue of a mouse model of dietary obesity. Inhibition of the Sema3E-plexinD1 axis markedly reduced adipose tissue inflammation and improved insulin resistance in this model. Conversely, overexpression of Sema3E in adipose tissue provoked inflammation and insulin resistance. Sema3E promoted infiltration of macrophages, and this effect was inhibited by disrupting plexinD1 expression in macrophages. Disruption of adipose tissue p53 expression led to downregulation of Sema3E expression and improved adipose tissue inflammation. These results indicate that Sema3E acts as a chemoattractant for macrophages, with p53-induced upregulation of Sema3E expression provoking adipose tissue inflammation and systemic insulin resistance in association with dietary obesity.

Abstract: Cell migration depends on the dynamic formation and turnover of cell adhesions and is tightly controlled by actomyosin contractility and local Ca2+ signals. The divalent cation channel TRPM7 (Transient Receptor Potential cation channel, subfamily Melastatin, member 7) has recently received much attention as a regulator of cell adhesion, migration and (localized) Ca2+ signaling. Overexpression and knockdown of TRPM7 affects actomyosin contractility and the formation of cell adhesions such as invadosomes and focal adhesions, but the role of TRPM7-mediated Ca2+ signals herein is currently not understood. Using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Ca2+ fluorometry and a novel automated analysis routine we have addressed the role of Ca2+ in the control of invadosome dynamics in N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells. We find that TRPM7 promotes the formation of highly repetitive and localized Ca2+ microdomains or “Ca2+ sparking hotspots” at the ventral plasma membrane. Ca2+ sparking appears strictly dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and is abolished by TRPM7 channel inhibitors such as waixenicin-A. TRPM7 inhibition also induces invadosome dissolution. However, invadosome formation is (functionally and spatially) dissociated from TRPM7-mediated Ca2+ sparks. Rather, our data indicate that TRPM7 affects actomyosin contractility and invadosome formation independent of Ca2+ influx.

Abstract: Summary
Plants evolve effective mechanisms to protect themselves from environmental stresses and employ jasmonates as vital defense signals to defend against insect attack and pathogen infection. Jasmonates are also recognized as an essential growth regulator by which diverse developmental processes are mediated. Despite substantial research, there are no key signaling components reported yet to control jasmonate-regulated plant defense independent of developmental responses. We identify JAV1, a key gene in the jasmonate pathway, which functions as a negative regulator to control plant defense but does not play a detectable role in plant development. Our results suggest that when encountering insect attack and pathogen infection, plants accumulate jasmonates that trigger JAV1 degradation via the 26S proteasome to activate defensive gene expression and elevate resistances against both insects and pathogens. These findings have provided insight into the molecular mechanism by which plants integrate jasmonate signals to protect themselves from insect attack and pathogen infection.

Abstract: Summary
The Uba6 (E1)-Use1 (E2) ubiquitin transfer cascade is a poorly understood alternative arm of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and is required for mouse embryonic development, independent of the canonical Uba1-E2-E3 pathway. Loss of neuronal Uba6 during embryonic development results in altered patterning of neurons in the hippocampus and the amygdala, decreased dendritic spine density, and numerous behavioral disorders. The levels of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ube3a (E6-AP) and Shank3, both linked with dendritic spine function, are elevated in the amygdala of Uba6-deficient mice, while levels of the Ube3a substrate Arc are reduced. Uba6 and Use1 promote proteasomal turnover of Ube3a in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and catalyze Ube3a ubiquitylation in vitro. These activities occur in parallel with an independent pathway involving Uba1-UbcH7, but in a spatially distinct manner in MEFs. These data reveal an unanticipated role for Uba6 in neuronal development, spine architecture, mouse behavior, and turnover of Ube3a.

Abstract: Summary
A large fraction of our genome consists of mobile genetic elements. Governing transposons in germ cells is critically important, and failure to do so compromises genome integrity, leading to sterility. In animals, the piRNA pathway is the key to transposon constraint, yet the precise molecular details of how piRNAs are formed and how the pathway represses mobile elements remain poorly understood. In an effort to identify general requirements for transposon control and components of the piRNA pathway, we carried out a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila ovarian somatic sheet cells. We identified and validated 87 genes necessary for transposon silencing. Among these were several piRNA biogenesis factors. We also found CG3893 (asterix) to be essential for transposon silencing, most likely by contributing to the effector step of transcriptional repression. Asterix loss leads to decreases in H3K9me3 marks on certain transposons but has no effect on piRNA levels.

Abstract: Summary
The reduced protein expression of SIRT6 tumor suppressor is involved in tumorigenesis. The molecular mechanisms underlying SIRT6 protein downregulation in human cancers remain unknown. Using a proteomic approach, we have identified the ubiquitin-specific peptidase USP10, another tumor suppressor, as one of the SIRT6-interacting proteins. USP10 suppresses SIRT6 ubiquitination to protect SIRT6 from proteasomal degradation. USP10 antagonizes the transcriptional activity of the c-Myc oncogene through SIRT6, as well as p53, to inhibit cell-cycle progression, cancer cell growth, and tumor formation. To support this conclusion, we detected significant reductions in both USP10 and SIRT6 protein expression in human colon cancers. Our study discovered crosstalk between two tumor-suppressive genes in regulating cell-cycle progression and proliferation and showed that dysregulated USP10 function promotes tumorigenesis through SIRT6 degradation.

Abstract: The expression of the six rice ASR genes is differentially regulated in a tissue-dependent manner according to environmental conditions and reproductive stages. OsASR1 and OsASR3 are the most abundant and are found in most tissues; they are enriched in the leaves and roots, respectively. Coexpression analysis of OsASR1 and OsASR3 and a comparison of the cis-acting elements upstream of OsASR1 and OsASR3 suggested that their expression is regulated in common by abiotic stresses but differently regulated by hormone and sugar signals. The results of quantitative real-time PCR analyses of OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression under various conditions further support this model. The expression of both OsASR1 and OsASR3 was induced by drought stress, which is a major regulator of the expression of all ASR genes in rice. In contrast, ABA is not a common regulator of the expression of these genes. OsASR1 transcription was highly induced by ABA, whereas OsASR3 transcription was strongly induced by GA. In addition, OsASR1 and OsASR3expression was significantly induced by sucrose and sucrose/glucose treatments, respectively. The induction of gene expression in response to these specific hormone and sugar signals was primarily observed in the major target tissues of these genes (i.e., OsASR1 in leaves and OsASR3 in roots). Our data also showed that the overexpression of either OsASR1 or OsASR3 in transgenic rice plants increased their tolerance to drought and cold stress. Taken together, our results revealed that the transcriptional control of different rice ASR genes exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities.

Abstract: Summary
The master transcription factor Pparγ regulates the general differentiation program of both brown and white adipocytes. However, it has been unclear whether Pparγ also controls fat lineage-specific characteristics. Here, we show that early B cell factor-2 (Ebf2) regulates Pparγ binding activity to determine brown versus white adipocyte identity. The Ebf DNA-binding motif was highly enriched within brown adipose-specific Pparγ binding sites that we identified by genome-wide ChIP-Seq. Of the Ebf isoforms, Ebf2 was selectively expressed in brown relative to white adipocytes and was bound at brown adipose-specific Pparγ target genes. When expressed in myoblasts or white preadipose cells, Ebf2 recruited Pparγ to its brown-selective binding sites and reprogrammed cells to a brown fat fate. Brown adipose cells and tissue from Ebf2-deficient mice displayed a loss of brown-specific characteristics and thermogenic capacity. Together, these results identify Ebf2 as a key transcriptional regulator of brown fat cell fate and function.

Abstract: Summary
The rodent tactile vibrissae are innervated by several different types of touch sensory neurons. The central afferents of all touch neurons from one vibrissa collectively project to a columnar structure called a barrelette in the brainstem. Delineating how distinct types of sensors connect to second-order neurons within each barrelette is critical for understanding tactile information coding and processing. Using genetic and viral techniques, we labeled slowly adapting (SA) mechanosensory neurons, rapidly adapting (RA) mechanosensory neurons, afferent synapses, and second-order projection neurons with four different fluorescent markers to examine their connectivity. We discovered that within each vibrissa column, individual sensory neurons project collaterals to multiply distributed locations, inputs from SA and RA afferents are spatially intermixed without any discernible stereotypy or topography, and second-order projection neurons receive convergent SA and RA inputs. Our findings reveal a “one-to-many and many-to-one” connectivity scheme and the circuit architecture for tactile information processing at the first-order synapses.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoid resistance is a major driver of therapeutic failure in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we identify the AKT1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor protein activity driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR3C1 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.

Role of polyhydroxybutyrate in mitochondrial calcium uptake,

Abstract: Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biological polymer which belongs to the class of polyesters and is ubiquitously present in all living organisms. Mammalian mitochondrial membranes contain PHB consisting of up to 120 hydroxybutyrate residues. Roles played by PHB in mammalian mitochondria remain obscure. It was previously demonstrated that PHB of the size similar to one found in mitochondria mediates calcium transport in lipid bilayer membranes. We hypothesized that the presence of PHB in mitochondrial membrane might play a significant role in mitochondrial calcium transport. To test this, we investigated how the induction of PHB hydrolysis affects mitochondrial calcium transport. Mitochondrial PHB was altered enzymatically by targeted expression of bacterial PHB hydrolyzing enzyme (PhaZ7) in mitochondria of mammalian cultured cells. The expression of PhaZ7 induced changes in mitochondrial metabolism resulting in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 but not in U87 and HeLa cells. Furthermore, it significantly inhibited mitochondrial calcium uptake in intact HepG2, U87 and HeLa cells stimulated by the ATP or by the application of increased concentrations of calcium to the digitonin permeabilized cells. Calcium uptake in PhaZ7 expressing cells was restored by mimicking calcium uniporter properties with natural electrogenic calcium ionophore – ferutinin. We propose that PHB is a previously unrecognized important component of the mitochondrial calcium uptake system.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres are specified by sequence-independent epigenetic mechanisms in most organisms. Rarely, centromere repositioning results in neocentromere formation at ectopic sites. However, the mechanisms governing how and where neocentromeres form are unknown. Here, we established a chromosome-engineering system in chicken DT40 cells that allowed us to efficiently isolate neocentromere-containing chromosomes. Neocentromeres appear to be structurally and functionally equivalent to native centromeres. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis with 18 neocentromeres revealed that the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A occupies an ∼40 kb region at each neocentromere, which has no preference for specific DNA sequence motifs. Furthermore, we found that neocentromeres were not associated with histone modifications H3K9me3, H3K4me2, and H3K36me3 or with early replication timing. Importantly, low but significant levels of CENP-A are detected around endogenous centromeres, which are capable of seeding neocentromere assembly if the centromere core is removed. In summary, our experimental system provides valuable insights for understanding how neocentromeres form.

Abstract: Summary
The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of tyrosine kinases is deregulated in multiple cancers either through amplification, overexpression, or mutation. ERBB3/HER3, the only member with an impaired kinase domain, although amplified or overexpressed in some cancers, has not been reported to carry oncogenic mutations. Here, we report the identification of ERBB3 somatic mutations in ∼11% of colon and gastric cancers. We found that the ERBB3 mutants transformed colonic and breast epithelial cells in a ligand-independent manner. However, the mutant ERBB3 oncogenic activity was dependent on kinase-active ERBB2. Furthermore, we found that anti-ERBB antibodies and small molecule inhibitors effectively blocked mutant ERBB3-mediated oncogenic signaling and disease progression in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The regulated release of polypeptides has a central role in physiology, behavior, and development, but the mechanisms responsible for production of the large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) capable of regulated release have remained poorly understood. Recent work has implicated cytosolic adaptor protein AP-3 in the recruitment of LDCV membrane proteins that confer regulated release. However, AP-3 in mammals has been considered to function in the endolysosomal pathway and in the biosynthetic pathway only in yeast. We now find that the mammalian homolog of yeast VPS41, a member of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex that delivers biosynthetic cargo to the endocytic pathway in yeast, promotes LDCV formation through a common mechanism with AP-3, indicating a conserved role for these proteins in the biosynthetic pathway. VPS41 also self-assembles into a lattice, suggesting that it acts as a coat protein for AP-3 in formation of the regulated secretory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
BRAF is an oncogenic protein kinase that drives cell growth and proliferation through the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. BRAF inhibitors have demonstrated antitumor efficacy in melanoma therapy but have also been found to be associated with the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) in certain patients. Here, we report that BRAF is phosphorylated at Ser729 by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical energy sensor. This phosphorylation promotes the association of BRAF with 14-3-3 proteins and disrupts its interaction with the KSR1 scaffolding protein, leading to attenuation of the MEK-ERK signaling. We also show that phosphorylation of BRAF by AMPK impairs keratinocyte cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression. Furthermore, AMPK activation attenuates BRAF inhibitor-induced ERK hyperactivation in keratinocytes and epidermal hyperplasia in mouse skin. Our findings reveal a mechanism for regulating BRAF signaling in response to energy stress and suggest a strategy for preventing the development of cSCCs associated with BRAF-targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft-tissue sarcoma with molecular and cellular features of developing skeletal muscle. Rhabdomyosarcoma has two major histologic subtypes, embryonal and alveolar, each with distinct clinical, molecular, and genetic features. Genomic analysis shows that embryonal tumors have more structural and copy number variations than alveolar tumors. Mutations in the RAS/NF1 pathway are significantly associated with intermediate- and high-risk embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS). In contrast, alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMS) have fewer genetic lesions overall and no known recurrently mutated cancer consensus genes. To identify therapeutics for ERMS, we developed and characterized orthotopic xenografts of tumors that were sequenced in our study. High-throughput screening of primary cultures derived from those xenografts identified oxidative stress as a pathway of therapeutic relevance for ERMS.

Abstract: Summary
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is found in a variety of tumors whose incidence greatly varies around the world. A poorly explored hypothesis is that particular EBV strains account for this phenomenon. We report that M81, a virus isolated from a Chinese patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), shows remarkable similarity to other NPC viruses but is divergent from all other known strains. M81 exhibited a reversed tropism relative to common strains with a reduced ability to infect B cells and a high propensity to infect epithelial cells, which is in agreement with its isolation from carcinomas. M81 spontaneously replicated in B cells in vitro and in vivo at unusually high levels, in line with the enhanced viral replication observed in NPC patients. Spontaneous replication and epitheliotropism could be partly ascribed to polymorphisms within viral proteins. We suggest considering M81 and its closely related isolates as an EBV subtype with enhanced pathogenic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (gba) gene cause Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disorder, and increase susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease (PD). While the clinical and pathological features of idiopathic PD and PD related to gba (PD-GBA) mutations are very similar, cellular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in each are unclear. Using a mouse model of neuronopathic GD, we show that autophagic machinery and proteasomal machinery are defective in neurons and astrocytes lacking gba. Markers of neurodegeneration—p62/SQSTM1, ubiquitinated proteins, and insoluble α-synuclein—accumulate. Mitochondria were dysfunctional and fragmented, with impaired respiration, reduced respiratory chain complex activities, and a decreased potential maintained by reversal of the ATP synthase. Thus a primary lysosomal defect causes accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria as a result of impaired autophagy and dysfunctional proteasomal pathways. These data provide conclusive evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in GD and provide insight into the pathogenesis of PD and PD-GBA.

Abstract: Summary
Prognosis for patients with estrogen-receptor (ER)-negative basal breast cancer is poor, and chemotherapy is currently the best therapeutic option. We have generated a compound-mutant mouse model combining the activation of β-catenin and HGF (Wnt-Met signaling), which produced rapidly growing basal mammary gland tumors. We identified the chemokine system CXCL12/CXCR4 as a crucial driver of Wnt-Met tumors, given that compound-mutant mice also deficient in the CXCR4 gene were tumor resistant. Wnt-Met activation rapidly expanded a population of cancer-propagating cells, in which the two signaling systems control different functions, self-renewal and differentiation. Molecular therapy targeting Wnt, Met, and CXCR4 in mice significantly delayed tumor development. The expression of a Wnt-Met 322 gene signature was found to be predictive of poor survival of human patients with ER-negative breast cancers. Thus, targeting CXCR4 and its upstream activators, Wnt and Met, might provide an efficient strategy for breast cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
We previously reported that mice deficient in acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) display a delayed metabolic adaptation to weaning. This includes a delayed activation of the hepatic lipogenic gene program, which may result from hepatic accumulation of triacylglycerol and/or cholesteryl esters in the late suckling period. To further investigate the basis for this phenotype, we generated mice deficient in ACBP in hepatocytes (Alb-ACBP−/−) and keratinocytes (K14-ACBP−/−). Surprisingly, the delayed adaptation to weaning, including hepatic lipid accumulation, is caused by ACBP deficiency in the skin rather than in the liver. Similarly to ACBP−/− mice, K14-ACBP−/− mice exhibit an increased transepidermal water loss, and we show that the hepatic phenotype is caused specifically by the epidermal barrier defect, which leads to increased lipolysis in white adipose tissue. Our data demonstrate that an imperfect epidermal barrier leads to profound suppression of the hepatic SREBP gene program and lipid accumulation in the liver.

Abstract: As an important cell model, luteal cells are used to study the reproductive cycle and pregnancy maintenance, but there has not yet had a simple and economical method in purifing goat luteal cells. In order to find a good method to isolate and purify the luteal cells from the Guan Zhong dairy goat corpus luteua, we compared the purification efficiency of Percoll density gradient centrifugation method with that of the differential detachment method using trypsin. After using these two methods for isolation, the purified cells were identified by staining for 3β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase activity. Cell diameter measurements and cell counting were used to categorize isolated cells from both methods. Cell proliferation activity of purified cells from both methods were studied by Cell Counting Kit-8 for 8 days. The results showed that, after Percoll discontinuous density gradient centrifugation, the purity of luteal cells was 98.2±1.2% in Percoll density layer of 30–40%. In comparison, the purity of luteal cells isolated in differential detachment by trypsin was 74.3±1.8%. Luteal cells purified from both methods stained positive for 3β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase activity, and cells purified by Percoll centrifugation showed a more rapid cell proliferation rate than cells purified by trypsin. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that Percoll density gradient centrifugation was superior to the method of differential detachment in cell purification efficiency and in maintenance of cell proliferation activity.

Abstract: Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoactive peptide with a pathogenic role in vascular diseases, has been shown to induce the activation of ERK1/2, PKB and the expression of a transcriptional regulator, the early growth response 1 (Egr-1), key mediators of hypertrophic and proliferative responses in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). We have demonstrated earlier that ET-1 requires H2O2 generation to activate these signaling pathways and Ca2+, calmodulin (CaM) and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), play a critical role to trigger H2O2-induced effects in VSMC. However, an involvement of CaMKII in mediating ET-1-induced responses in VSMC remains unknown. Therefore, by utilizing pharmacological inhibitors of CaM, CaMKII, a CaMKII inhibitor peptide and CaMKII knockdown techniques, we have investigated the contribution of CaM and CaMKII in ET-1-induced ERK1/2 and PKB signaling, Egr-1 expression and hypertrophic and proliferative responses in VSMC. W-7 and calmidazolium, antagonists of CaM, as well as KN-93, an inhibitor of CaMKII activity, attenuated ET-1-induced ERK1/2 and PKB phosphorylation. In addition, transfection of VSMC with a CaMKII inhibitory peptide suppressed ET-1-evoked ERK1/2 and PKB phosphorylation. Similarly, siRNA-mediated CaMKII silencing reduced ET-1-produced ERK1/2 and PKB phosphorylation. CaM and CaMKII blockade also significantly lowered the ET-1-induced protein and DNA synthesis as well as Egr-1 expression. These findings demonstrate that CaMKII plays a critical role in ET-1-induced growth promoting signaling pathways as well as hypertrophic and proliferative responses in VSMC.

Abstract: Summary
During miRNA biogenesis, the microprocessor complex (MC), which is composed minimally of Drosha, an RNase III enzyme, and DGCR8, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, cleaves the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) in order to release the pre-miRNA stem-loop structure. Using phosphoproteomics, we mapped 23 phosphorylation sites on full-length human DGCR8 expressed in insect or mammalian cells. DGCR8 can be phosphorylated by mitogenic ERK/MAPK, indicating that DGCR8 phosphorylation may respond to and integrate extracellular cues. The expression of phosphomimetic DGCR8 or inhibition of phosphatases increased the cellular levels of DGCR8 and Drosha proteins. Increased levels of phosphomimetic DGCR8 were not due to higher mRNA levels, altered DGCR8 localization, or DGCR8’s ability to self-associate, but rather to an increase in protein stability. MCs incorporating phosphomutant or phosphomimetic DGCR8 were not altered in specific processing activity. However, HeLa cells expressing phosphomimetic DGCR8 exhibited a progrowth miRNA expression profile and increased proliferation and scratch closure rates relative to cells expressing phosphomutant DGCR8.

Abstract: Summary
In mouse and human neural progenitor and glioblastoma “stem-like” cells, we identified key targets of the Polycomb-group protein BMI1 by combining ChIP-seq with in vivo RNAi screening. We discovered that Bmi1 is important in the cellular response to the transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein (TGF-β/BMP) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, in part converging on the Atf3 transcriptional repressor. We show that Atf3 is a tumor-suppressor gene inactivated in human glioblastoma multiforme together with Cbx7 and a few other candidates. Acting downstream of the ER stress and BMP pathways, ATF3 binds to cell-type-specific accessible chromatin preloaded with AP1 and participates in the inhibition of critical oncogenic networks. Our data support the feasibility of combining ChIP-seq and RNAi screens in solid tumors and highlight multiple p16INK4a/p19ARF-independent functions for Bmi1 in development and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Controlling the position of the nucleus is vital for a number of cellular processes from yeast to humans. In Drosophila nurse cells, nuclear positioning is crucial during dumping, when nurse cells contract and expel their contents into the oocyte. We provide evidence that in nurse cells, continuous filopodia-like actin cables, growing from the plasma membrane and extending to the nucleus, achieve nuclear positioning. These actin cables move nuclei away from ring canals. When nurse cells contract, actin cables associate laterally with the nuclei, in some cases inducing nuclear turning so that actin cables become partially wound around the nuclei. Our data suggest that a perinuclear actin meshwork connects actin cables to nuclei via actin-crosslinking proteins such as the filamin Cheerio. We provide a revised model for how actin structures position nuclei in nurse cells, employing evolutionary conserved machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated development of brain stem and spinal target neurons is pivotal for the emergence of a precisely functioning locomotor system. Signals that match the development of these far-apart regions of the central nervous system may be redeployed during spinal cord regeneration. Here we show that descending dopaminergic projections from the brain promote motor neuron generation at the expense of V2 interneurons in the developing zebrafish spinal cord by activating the D4a receptor, which acts on the hedgehog pathway. Inhibiting this essential signal during early neurogenesis leads to a long-lasting reduction of motor neuron numbers and impaired motor responses of free-swimming larvae. Importantly, during successful spinal cord regeneration in adult zebrafish, endogenous dopamine promotes generation of spinal motor neurons, and dopamine agonists augment this process. Hence, we describe a supraspinal control mechanism for the development and regeneration of specific spinal cell types that uses dopamine as a signal.

Abstract: Summary
Increased cortical size is essential to the enhanced intellectual capacity of primates during mammalian evolution. The mechanisms that control cortical size are largely unknown. Here, we show that mammalian BAF170, a subunit of the chromatin remodeling complex mSWI/SNF, is an intrinsic factor that controls cortical size. We find that conditional deletion of BAF170 promotes indirect neurogenesis by increasing the pool of intermediate progenitors (IPs) and results in an enlarged cortex, whereas cortex-specific BAF170 overexpression results in the opposite phenotype. Mechanistically, BAF170 competes with BAF155 subunit in the BAF complex, affecting euchromatin structure and thereby modulating the binding efficiency of the Pax6/REST-corepressor complex to Pax6 target genes that regulate the generation of IPs and late cortical progenitors. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism mediated by the mSWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex that controls cortical architecture.

Abstract: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcriptional regulator for the protection of cells against oxidative and xenobiotic stresses. Recent studies have demonstrated that high constitutive expression of Nrf2 is observed in many types of cancer cells showing resistance to anti-cancer drugs, suggesting that the suppression of overexpressed Nrf2 could be an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome cancer drug resistance. In the present study, we aimed to find small molecule compounds that enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to cisplatin induced cytotoxicity by suppressing Nrf2-mediated defense mechanism. A549 lung cancer cells were shown to be more resistant to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin than HEK293 cells, with higher Nrf2 signaling activity; constitutively high amounts of Nrf2-downstream target proteins were observed in A549 cells. Among the three chalcone derivatives 4-methoxy-chalcone (4-MC), hesperidin methylchalcone, and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, 4-MC was found to suppress transcriptional activity of Nrf2 in A549 cells but to activate it in HEK293 cells. 4-MC was also shown to down-regulate expression of Nrf2 and the downstream phase II detoxifying enzyme NQO1 in A549 cells. The PI3K/Akt pathway was found to be involved in the 4MC-induced inhibition of Nrf2/ARE activity in A549 cells. This inhibition of Nrf2 signaling results in the accelerated generation of reactive oxygen species and exacerbation of cytotoxicity in cisplatin-treated A549 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the small molecule compound 4-MC could be used to enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to the therapeutic effect of cisplatin through the regulation of Nrf2/ARE signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin-like proteins have been shown to be covalently conjugated to targets. However, the functions of these ubiquitin-like proteins are largely unknown. Here, we have screened most known ubiquitin-like proteins after DNA damage and found that NEDD8 is involved in the DNA damage response. Following various DNA damage stimuli, NEDD8 accumulated at DNA damage sites; this accumulation was dependent on an E2 enzyme (UBE2M) and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (RNF111). We further found that histone H4 was polyneddylated in response to DNA damage, and NEDD8 was conjugated to the N-terminal lysine residues of H4. Interestingly, the DNA damage-induced polyneddylation chain could be recognized by the MIU (motif interacting with ubiquitin) domain of RNF168. Loss of DNA damage-induced neddylation negatively regulated DNA damage-induced foci formation of RNF168 and its downstream functional partners, such as 53BP1 and BRCA1, thus affecting the normal DNA damage repair process.

Abstract: Summary
Four molecules of the tumor suppressor p53 assemble to cooperatively bind proapoptotic target genes. The structural basis for cooperativity consists of interactions between adjacent DNA binding domains. Mutations at the interaction interface that compromise cooperativity were identified in cancer patients, suggesting a requirement of cooperativity for tumor suppression. We report on an analysis of cooperativity mutant p53E177R mice. Apoptotic functions of p53 triggered by DNA damage and oncogenes were abolished in these mice, whereas functions in cell-cycle control, senescence, metabolism, and antioxidant defense were retained and were sufficient to suppress development of spontaneous T cell lymphoma. Cooperativity mutant mice are nevertheless highly cancer prone and susceptible to different oncogene-induced tumors. Our data underscore the relevance of DNA binding cooperativity for p53-dependent apoptosis and tumor suppression and highlight cooperativity mutations as a class of p53 mutations that result in a selective loss of apoptotic functions due to an altered quaternary structure of the p53 tetramer.

Abstract: Summary
To warrant the quality of the secretory proteome, stringent control systems operate at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi interface, preventing the release of nonnative products. Incompletely assembled oligomeric proteins that are deemed correctly folded must rely on additional quality control mechanisms dedicated to proper assembly. Here we unveil how ERp44 cycles between cisGolgi and ER in a pH-regulated manner, patrolling assembly of disulfide-linked oligomers such as IgM and adiponectin. At neutral, ER-equivalent pH, the ERp44 carboxy-terminal tail occludes the substrate-binding site. At the lower pH of the cisGolgi, conformational rearrangements of this peptide, likely involving protonation of ERp44’s active cysteine, simultaneously unmask the substrate binding site and −RDEL motif, allowing capture of orphan secretory protein subunits and ER retrieval via KDEL receptors. The ERp44 assembly control cycle couples secretion fidelity and efficiency downstream of the calnexin/calreticulin and BiP-dependent quality control cycles.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear shape and size vary between species, during development, and in many tissue pathologies, but the causes and effects of these differences remain poorly understood. During fertilization, sperm nuclei undergo a dramatic conversion from a heavily compacted form into decondensed, spherical pronuclei, accompanied by rapid nucleation of microtubules from centrosomes. Here we report that the assembly of the spherical nucleus depends on a critical balance of microtubule dynamics, which is regulated by the chromatin-binding protein Developmental pluripotency-associated 2 (Dppa2). Whereas microtubules normally promote sperm pronuclear expansion, in Dppa2-depleted Xenopus egg extracts excess microtubules cause pronuclear assembly defects, leading to abnormal morphology and disorganized DNA replication. Dppa2 inhibits microtubule polymerization in vitro, and Dppa2 activity is needed at a precise time and location during nascent pronuclear formation. This demonstrates a strict spatiotemporal requirement for local suppression of microtubules during nuclear formation, fulfilled by chromatin-bound microtubule regulators.

Syndecan-4 Phosphorylation Is a Control Point for Integrin Recycling,

Abstract: Summary
Precise spatiotemporal coordination of integrin adhesion complex dynamics is essential for efficient cell migration. For cells adherent to fibronectin, differential engagement of α5β1 and αVβ3 integrins is used to elicit changes in adhesion complex stability, mechanosensation, matrix assembly, and migration, but the mechanisms responsible for receptor regulation have remained largely obscure. We identify phosphorylation of the membrane-intercalated proteoglycan syndecan-4 as an essential switch controlling integrin recycling. Src phosphorylates syndecan-4 and, by driving syntenin binding, leads to suppression of Arf6 activity and recycling of αVβ3 to the plasma membrane at the expense of α5β1. The resultant elevation in αVβ3 engagement promotes stabilization of focal adhesions. Conversely, abrogation of syndecan-4 phosphorylation drives surface expression of α5β1, destabilizes adhesion complexes, and disrupts cell migration. These data identify the dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of Src-mediated syndecan-4 phosphorylation as an essential switch controlling integrin trafficking and adhesion dynamics to promote efficient cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Planar cell rearrangements control epithelial tissue morphogenesis and cellular pattern formation. They lead to the formation of new junctions whose length and stability determine the cellular pattern of tissues. Here, we show that during Drosophila wing development the loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN disrupts cell rearrangements by preventing the lengthening of newly formed junctions that become unstable and keep on rearranging. We demonstrate that the failure to lengthen and to stabilize is caused by the lack of a decrease of Myosin II and Rho-kinase concentration at the newly formed junctions. This defect results in a heterogeneous cortical contractility at cell junctions that disrupts regular hexagonal pattern formation. By identifying PTEN as a specific regulator of junction lengthening and stability, our results uncover how a homogenous distribution of cortical contractility along the cell cortex is restored during cell rearrangement to control the formation of epithelial cellular pattern.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine methylation occurs on both histone and nonhistone proteins. However, our knowledge on the prevalence and function of nonhistone protein methylation is poor. We describe an approach that combines peptide array, bioinformatics, and mass spectrometry to systematically identify lysine methylation sites and map methyllysine-driven protein-protein interactions. Using this approach, we identified a high-confidence and high-resolution interactome of the heterochromatin protein 1β (HP1β) and uncovered, simultaneously, numerous methyllysine sites on nonhistone proteins. We found that HP1β binds to DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and regulates its localization to double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA damage response (DDR). Mutation of the methylation sites in DNA-PKcs or depletion of HP1β in cells caused defects in DDR. Furthermore, we showed that the methylation of DNA-PKcs and many other proteins in the HP1β interactome undergoes large changes in response to DNA damage, indicating that Lys methylation is a highly dynamic posttranslational modification.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is essential for innate immune function and requires strict regulation. The micronutrient zinc modulates proper host defense, and zinc deficiency is associated with elevated inflammation and worse outcomes in response to bacterial infection and sepsis. Previous studies suggest that zinc may regulate NF-κB activity during innate immune activation, but a mechanistic basis to support this has been lacking. Herein, we report that the zinc transporter SLC39A8 (ZIP8) is a transcriptional target of NF-κB and functions to negatively regulate proinflammatory responses through zinc-mediated down-modulation of IκB kinase (IKK) activity in vitro. Accordingly, fetal fibroblasts obtained from Slc39a8 hypomorphic mice exhibited dysregulated zinc uptake and increased NF-κB activation. Consistent with this, mice provided zinc-deficient dietary intakes developed excessive inflammation to polymicrobial sepsis in conjunction with insufficient control of IKK. Our findings identify a negative feedback loop that directly regulates innate immune function through coordination of zinc metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Strategies for expanding hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) include coculture with cells that recapitulate their natural microenvironment, such as bone marrow stromal stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs). Plastic-adherent BMSCs may be insufficient to preserve primitive HSCs. Here, we describe a method of isolating and culturing human BMSCs as nonadherent mesenchymal spheres. Human mesenspheres were derived from CD45− CD31− CD71− CD146+ CD105+ nestin+ cells but could also be simply grown from fetal and adult BM CD45−-enriched cells. Human mesenspheres robustly differentiated into mesenchymal lineages. In culture conditions where they displayed a relatively undifferentiated phenotype, with decreased adherence to plastic and increased self-renewal, they promoted enhanced expansion of cord blood CD34+ cells through secreted soluble factors. Expanded HSCs were serially transplantable in immunodeficient mice and significantly increased long-term human hematopoietic engraftment. These results pave the way for culture techniques that preserve the self-renewal of human BMSCs and their ability to support functional HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a cellular self-catabolic process wherein organelles, macromolecules, and invading microbes are sequestered in autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes. In this study, we uncover the role of nitric oxide (NO) as a signaling molecule for autophagy induction via its downstream mediator, 8-nitroguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP). We found that 8-nitro-cGMP-induced autophagy is mediated by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and that endogenous 8-nitro-cGMP promotes autophagic exclusion of invading group A Streptococcus (GAS) from cells. 8-nitro-cGMP can modify Cys residues by S-guanylation of proteins. We showed that intracellular GAS is modified with S-guanylation extensively in autophagosomes-like vacuoles, suggesting the role of S-guanylation as a marker for selective autophagic degradation. This finding is supported by the fact that S-guanylated bacteria were selectively marked with polyubiquitin, a known molecular tag for selective transport to autophagosomes. These results collectively indicate that 8-nitro-cGMP plays a crucial role in cytoprotection during bacterial infections or inflammations via autophagy upregulation.

Abstract: Communication between vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) allows control of their contraction and so regulation of blood flow. The contractile state of SMCs is regulated by cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) which propagates as Ca2+ waves over a significant distance along the vessel. We have characterized an intercellular ultrafast Ca2+ wave observed in cultured A7r5 cell line and in primary cultured SMCs (pSMCs) from rat mesenteric arteries. This wave, induced by local mechanical or local KCl stimulation, had a velocity around 15mm/s. Combining of precise alignment of cells with fast Ca2+ imaging and intracellular membrane potential recording, allowed us to analyze rapid [Ca2+]i dynamics and membrane potential events along the network of cells. The rate of [Ca2+]i increase along the network decreased with distance from the stimulation site. Gap junctions or voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs) inhibition suppressed the ultrafast Ca2+ wave. Mechanical stimulation induced a membrane depolarization that propagated and that decayed exponentially with distance. Our results demonstrate that an electrotonic spread of membrane depolarization drives a rapid Ca2+ entry from the external medium through VOCCs, modeled as an ultrafast Ca2+ wave. This wave may trigger and drive slower Ca2+ waves observed ex vivo and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Various specialized domains have been described in the cytosol and the nucleus; however, little is known about compartmentalization within the mitochondrial matrix. GRSF1 (G-rich sequence factor 1) is an RNA binding protein that was previously reported to localize in the cytosol. We found that an isoform of GRSF1 accumulates in discrete foci in the mitochondrial matrix. These foci are composed of nascent mitochondrial RNA and also contain RNase P, an enzyme that participates in mitochondrial RNA processing. GRSF1 was found to interact with RNase P and to be required for processing of both classical and tRNA-less RNA precursors. In its absence, cleavage of primary RNA transcripts is abnormal, leading to decreased expression of mitochondrially encoded proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the foci containing GRSF1 and RNase P correspond to sites where primary RNA transcripts converge to be processed. We have termed these large ribonucleoprotein structures “mitochondrial RNA granules.”

Abstract: Summary
Nα-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins was recently discovered to create specific degradation signals termed Ac/N-degrons and targeted by the Ac/N-end rule pathway. We show that Hcn1, a subunit of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase, contains an Ac/N-degron that is repressed by Cut9, another APC/C subunit and the ligand of Hcn1. Cog1, a subunit of the Golgi-associated COG complex, is also shown to contain an Ac/N-degron. Cog2 and Cog3, direct ligands of Cog1, can repress this degron. The subunit decoy technique was used to show that the long-lived endogenous Cog1 is destabilized and destroyed via its activated (unshielded) Ac/N-degron if the total level of Cog1 increased in a cell. Hcn1 and Cog1 are the first examples of protein regulation through the physiologically relevant transitions that shield and unshield natural Ac/N-degrons. This mechanistically straightforward circuit can employ the demonstrated conditionality of Ac/N-degrons to regulate subunit stoichiometries and other aspects of protein quality control.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate animal cell division requires precise coordination of changes in the structure of the microtubule-based spindle and the actin-based cell cortex. Here, we use a series of perturbation experiments to dissect the relative roles of actin, cortical mechanics, and cell shape in spindle formation. We find that, whereas the actin cortex is largely dispensable for rounding and timely mitotic progression in isolated cells, it is needed to drive rounding to enable unperturbed spindle morphogenesis under conditions of confinement. Using different methods to limit mitotic cell height, we show that a failure to round up causes defects in spindle assembly, pole splitting, and a delay in mitotic progression. These defects can be rescued by increasing microtubule lengths and therefore appear to be a direct consequence of the limited reach of mitotic centrosome-nucleated microtubules. These findings help to explain why most animal cells round up as they enter mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a highly desirable form of plant defense, provides broad-spectrum immunity against diverse pathogens. The recent identification of seemingly unrelated chemical inducers of SAR warrants an investigation of their mutual interrelationships. We show that SAR induced by the dicarboxylic acid azelaic acid (AA) requires the phosphorylated sugar derivative glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). Pathogen inoculation induced the release of free unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) and thereby triggered AA accumulation, because these FAs serve as precursors for AA. AA accumulation in turn increased the levels of G3P, which is required for AA-conferred SAR. The lipid transfer proteins DIR1 and AZI1, both of which are required for G3P- and AA-induced SAR, were essential for G3P accumulation. Conversely, reduced G3P resulted in decreased AZI1 and DIR1 transcription. Our results demonstrate that an intricate feedback regulatory loop among G3P, DIR1, and AZI1 regulates SAR and that AA functions upstream of G3P in this pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Protein aggregates are a common feature of neurodegenerative syndromes. Specific protein fragments were found to be aggregated in disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease. Here, we show that the natural C-terminal fragments of Tau, TDP43, and α-synuclein are short-lived substrates of the Arg/N-end rule pathway, a processive proteolytic system that targets proteins bearing “destabilizing” N-terminal residues. Furthermore, a natural TDP43 fragment is shown to be metabolically stabilized in Ate1−/− fibroblasts that lack the arginylation branch of the Arg/N-end rule pathway, leading to accumulation and aggregation of this fragment. We also found that a fraction of Aβ42, the Alzheimer’s disease-associated fragment of APP, is N-terminally arginylated in the brains of 5xFAD mice and is degraded by the Arg/N-end rule pathway. The discovery that neurodegeneration-associated natural fragments of TDP43, Tau, α-synuclein, and APP can be selectively destroyed by the Arg/N-end rule pathway suggests that this pathway counteracts neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil polarity relies on local, mutual inhibition to segregate incompatible signaling circuits to the leading and trailing edges. Mutual inhibition alone should lead to cells having strong fronts and weak backs or vice versa. However, analysis of cell-to-cell variation in human neutrophils revealed that back polarity remains consistent despite changes in front strength. How is this buffering achieved? Pharmacological perturbations and mathematical modeling revealed a functional role for microtubules in buffering back polarity by mediating positive, long-range crosstalk from front to back; loss of microtubules inhibits buffering and results in anticorrelation between front and back signaling. Furthermore, a systematic, computational search of network topologies found that a long-range, positive front-to-back link is necessary for back buffering. Our studies suggest a design principle that can be employed by polarity networks: short-range mutual inhibition establishes distinct signaling regions, after which directed long-range activation insulates one region from variations in the other.

Spindle Formation in the Mouse Embryo Requires Plk4 in the Absence of Centrioles,

Abstract: Summary
During the first five rounds of cell division in the mouse embryo, spindles assemble in the absence of centrioles. Spindle formation initiates around chromosomes, but the microtubule nucleating process remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that Plk4, a protein kinase known as a master regulator of centriole formation, is also essential for spindle assembly in the absence of centrioles. Depletion of maternal Plk4 prevents nucleation and growth of microtubules and results in monopolar spindle formation. This leads to cytokinesis failure and, consequently, developmental arrest. We show that Plk4 function depends on its kinase activity and its partner protein, Cep152. Moreover, tethering Cep152 to cellular membranes sequesters Plk4 and is sufficient to trigger spindle assembly from ectopic membranous sites. Thus, the Plk4-Cep152 complex has an unexpected role in promoting microtubule nucleation in the vicinity of chromosomes to mediate bipolar spindle formation in the absence of centrioles.

Abstract: Summary
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates cellular energy homeostasis by inhibiting anabolic and activating catabolic processes. While AMPK activation has been extensively studied, mechanisms that inhibit AMPK remain elusive. Here we report that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibits AMPK function. GSK3 forms a stable complex with AMPK through interactions with the AMPK β regulatory subunit and phosphorylates the AMPK α catalytic subunit. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the activation loop of the α subunit to phosphatases, thereby inhibiting AMPK kinase activity. Surprisingly, PI3K-Akt signaling, which is a major anabolic signaling and normally inhibits GSK3 activity, promotes GSK3 phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPK, thus revealing how AMPK senses anabolic environments in addition to cellular energy levels. Consistently, disrupting GSK3 function within the AMPK complex sustains higher AMPK activity and cellular catabolic processes even under anabolic conditions, indicating that GSK3 acts as a critical sensor for anabolic signaling to regulate AMPK.

MEK1 Is Required for PTEN Membrane Recruitment, AKT Regulation, and the Maintenance of Peripheral Tolerance,

Abstract: Summary
The Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways are prominent effectors of oncogenic Ras. These pathways negatively regulate each other, but the mechanism involved is incompletely understood. We now identify MEK1 as an essential regulator of lipid/protein phosphatase PTEN, through which it controls phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate accumulation and AKT signaling. MEK1 ablation stabilizes AKT activation and, in vivo, causes a lupus-like autoimmune disease and myeloproliferation. Mechanistically, MEK1 is necessary for PTEN membrane recruitment as part of a ternary complex containing the multidomain adaptor MAGI1. Complex formation is independent of MEK1 kinase activity but requires phosphorylation of T292 on MEK1 by activated ERK. Thus, inhibiting the ERK pathway reduces PTEN membrane recruitment, increasing phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate accumulation and AKT activation. Our data offer a conceptual framework for the observation that activation of the PI3K pathway frequently mediate resistance to MEK inhibitors and for the promising results obtained by combined MEK/PI3K inhibition in preclinical cancer models.

Ubiquitin Binding by a CUE Domain Regulates Ubiquitin Chain Formation by ERAD E3 Ligases,

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) differentially recognize ubiquitin (ub) modifications. Some of them specifically bind mono-ub, as has been shown for the CUE domain. Interestingly, so far no significant ubiquitin binding has been observed for the CUE domain of yeast Cue1p. Cue1p is receptor and activator of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p. It integrates Ubc7p into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase complexes, and thus, it is crucial for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Here we show that the CUE domain of Cue1p binds ubiquitin chains, which is pivotal for the efficient formation of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro. Mutations that abolish ubiquitin binding by Cue1p affect the turnover of ERAD substrates in vivo. Our data strongly imply that the CUE domain facilitates substrate ubiquitylation by stabilizing growing ubiquitin chains at the ERAD ubiquitin ligases. Hence, we demonstrate an unexpected function of a UBD in the regulation of ubiquitin chain synthesis.
