Abstract: Hair cells mediate our senses of hearing and balance by synaptic release of glutamate from somatic active zones (AZs). They share conserved mechanisms of exocytosis with neurons and other secretory cells of diverse form and function. Concurrently, AZs of these neuro-epithelial hair cells employ several processes that differ remarkably from those of neuronal synaptic terminals of the brain. Their unique molecular anatomy enables them to better respond to small, graded changes in membrane potential and to produce unsurpassed rates of exocytosis. Here, we focus on the AZs of cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs). As in other hair cells, these AZs are occupied by a cytoplasmic extension of the presynaptic density, called the synaptic ribbon: a specialized protein complex required for normal physiological function. Some proteins found at IHC synapses are uniquely expressed or enriched there, where their disruption can beget deafness in humans and in animal models. Other proteins, essential for regulation of conventional neuronal Ca2+-triggered fusion, are apparently absent from IHCs. Certain common synaptic proteins appear to have extra significance at ribbon-type AZs because of their interactions with unique molecules, their unusual concentrations, or their atypical localization and regulation. We summarize the molecular–anatomical specializations that underlie the unique synaptic physiology of hair cells.

Abstract: Summary
Macromolecular complexes are essential players in numerous biological processes. They are often large, dynamic, and rather labile; approaches to study them are scarce. Covering masses up to ∼30 MDa, we separated the native complexome of rat heart mitochondria by blue-native and large-pore blue-native gel electrophoresis to analyze its constituents by mass spectrometry. Similarities in migration patterns allowed hierarchical clustering into interaction profiles representing a comprehensive analysis of soluble and membrane-bound complexes of an entire organelle. The power of this bottom-up approach was validated with well-characterized mitochondrial multiprotein complexes. TMEM126B was found to comigrate with known assembly factors of mitochondrial complex I, namely CIA30, Ecsit, and Acad9. We propose terming this complex mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TMEM126B is required for assembly of complex I. In summary, complexome profiling is a powerful and unbiased technique allowing the identification of previously overlooked components of large multiprotein complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated metabolism is a hallmark of cancer cell lines, but little is known about the fate of glucose and other nutrients in tumors growing in their native microenvironment. To study tumor metabolism in vivo, we used an orthotopic mouse model of primary human glioblastoma (GBM). We infused 13C-labeled nutrients into mice bearing three independent GBM lines, each with a distinct set of mutations. All three lines displayed glycolysis, as expected for aggressive tumors. They also displayed unexpected metabolic complexity, oxidizing glucose via pyruvate dehydrogenase and the citric acid cycle, and using glucose to supply anaplerosis and other biosynthetic activities. Comparing the tumors to surrounding brain revealed obvious metabolic differences, notably the accumulation of a large glutamine pool within the tumors. Many of these same activities were conserved in cells cultured ex vivo from the tumors. Thus GBM cells utilize mitochondrial glucose oxidation during aggressive tumor growth in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Axon regeneration allows neurons to repair circuits after trauma; however, most of the molecular players in this process remain to be identified. Given that microtubule rearrangements have been observed in injured neurons, we tested whether microtubule-severing proteins might play a role in axon regeneration. We found that axon regeneration is extremely sensitive to levels of the microtubule-severing protein spastin. Although microtubule behavior in uninjured neurons was not perturbed in animals heterozygous for a spastin null allele, axon regeneration was severely disrupted in this background. Two types of axon regeneration—regeneration of an axon from a dendrite after proximal axotomy and regeneration of an axon from the stump after distal axotomy—were defective in Drosophila with one mutant copy of the spastin gene. Other types of axon and dendrite outgrowth, including regrowth of dendrites after pruning, were normal in heterozygotes. We conclude that regenerative axon growth is uniquely sensitive to spastin gene dosage.

Processive Steps in the Reverse Direction Require Uncoupling of the Lead Head Lever Arm of Myosin VI,

Abstract: Summary
Myosin VI is the only known reverse-direction myosin motor. It has an unprecedented means of amplifying movements within the motor involving rearrangements of the converter subdomain at the C terminus of the motor and an unusual lever arm projecting from the converter. While the average step size of a myosin VI dimer is 30–36 nm, the step size is highly variable, presenting a challenge to the lever arm mechanism by which all myosins are thought to move. Herein, we present structures of myosin VI that reveal regions of compliance that allow an uncoupling of the lead head when movement is modeled on actin. The location of the compliance restricts the possible actin binding sites and predicts the observed stepping behavior. The model reveals that myosin VI, unlike plus-end directed myosins, does not use a pure lever arm mechanism, but instead steps with a mechanism analogous to the kinesin neck-linker uncoupling model.

Abstract: Summary
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, the most widely used animal model of DNA-PKcs (Prkdc) deficiency, have contributed enormously to our understanding of immunodeficiency, lymphocyte development, and DNA-repair mechanisms, and they are ideal hosts for allogeneic and xenogeneic tissue transplantation. Here, we use zinc-finger nucleases to generate rats that lack either the Prkdc gene (SCID) or the Prkdc and Il2rg genes (referred to as F344-scid gamma [FSG] rats). SCID rats show several phenotypic differences from SCID mice, including growth retardation, premature senescence, and a more severe immunodeficiency without “leaky” phenotypes. Double-knockout FSG rats show an even more immunocompromised phenotype, such as the abolishment of natural killer cells. Finally, xenotransplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cells, ovarian cancer cells, and hepatocytes shows that SCID and FSG rats can act as hosts for xenogeneic tissue grafts and stem cell transplantation and may be useful for preclinical testing of new drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factor access to regulatory elements is prevented by the nucleosome. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a winged helix transcription factor that plays roles in control and stressed conditions by gaining access to target elements, but mechanisms of HSF1 access are not well known in mammalian cells. Here, we show the physical interaction between the wing motif of human HSF1 and replication protein A (RPA), which is involved in DNA metabolism. Depletion of RPA1 abolishes HSF1 access to the promoter of HSP70 in unstressed condition and delays its rapid activation in response to heat shock. The HSF1-RPA complex leads to preloading of RNA polymerase II and opens the chromatin structure by recruiting a histone chaperone, FACT. Furthermore, this interaction is required for melanoma cell proliferation. These results provide a mechanism of constitutive HSF1 access to nucleosomal DNA, which is important for both basal and inducible gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial cell wall is conserved in prokaryotes, stabilizing cells against osmotic stress. Beta-lactams inhibit cell-wall synthesis and induce lysis through a bulge-mediated mechanism; however, little is known about the formation dynamics and stability of these bulges. To capture processes of different timescales, we developed an imaging platform combining automated image analysis with live-cell microscopy at high time resolution. Beta-lactam killing of Escherichia coli cells proceeded through four stages: elongation, bulge formation, bulge stagnation, and lysis. Both the cell wall and outer membrane (OM) affect the observed dynamics; damaging the cell wall with different beta-lactams and compromising OM integrity cause different modes and rates of lysis. Our results show that the bulge-formation dynamics are determined by how the cell wall is perturbed. The OM plays an independent role in stabilizing the bulge once it is formed. The stabilized bulge delays lysis and allows recovery upon drug removal.

Abstract: Summary
Trp63, a transcription factor related to the tumor suppressor p53, is activated by diverse stimuli and can initiate a range of cellular responses. TAp63 is the predominant Trp53 family member in primordial follicle oocyte nuclei and is essential for their apoptosis triggered by DNA damage in vivo. After γ-irradiation, induction of the proapoptotic BH3-only members Puma and Noxa was observed in primordial follicle oocytes from WT and Trp53−/− mice but not in those from TAp63-deficient mice. Primordial follicle oocytes from mice lacking Puma or both Puma and Noxa were protected from γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis and, remarkably, could produce healthy offspring. Hence, PUMA and NOXA are critical for DNA damage-induced, TAp63-mediated primordial follicle oocyte apoptosis. Thus, blockade of PUMA may protect fertility during cancer therapy and prevent premature menopause, improving women’s health.

Abstract: Hyaluronic acid (HA) has been shown to promote angiogenesis. However, the mechanism behind this effect remains largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, the mechanism of HA-induced angiogenesis was examined. CD44 and PKCδ were shown to be necessary for induction of the receptor for HA-mediated cell motility (RHAMM), a HA-binding protein. RHAMM was necessary for HA-promoted cellular invasion and endothelial cell tube formation. Cytokine arrays showed that HA induced the expression of plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI), a downstream target of TGFβ receptor signaling. The induction of PAI-1 was dependent on CD44 and PKCδ. HA also induced an interaction between RHAMM and TGFβ receptor I, and induction of PAI-1 was dependent on RHAMM and TGFβ receptor I. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which is decreased by HA via rac1, reduced induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by HA. ERK, which interacts with RHAMM, was necessary for induction of PAI-1 by HA. Snail, a downstream target of TGFβ signaling, was also necessary for induction of PAI-1. The down regulation of PAI-1 prevented HA from enhancing endothelial cell tube formation and from inducing expression of angiogenic factors, such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MMP-2. HDAC3 also exerted reduced expression of MMP-2. In this study, we provide a novel mechanism of HA-promoted angiogenesis, which involved RHAMM-TGFβRI signaling necessary for induction of PAI-1.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have raised the possibility that Wnt signaling may regulate both neural progenitor maintenance and neuronal differentiation within a single population. Here we investigate the role of Wnt/β-catenin activity in the zebrafish hypothalamus and find that the pathway is first required for the proliferation of unspecified hypothalamic progenitors in the embryo. At later stages, including adulthood, sequential activation and inhibition of Wnt activity is required for the differentiation of neural progenitors and negatively regulates radial glia differentiation. The presence of Wnt activity is conserved in hypothalamic progenitors of the adult mouse, where it plays a conserved role in inhibiting the differentiation of radial glia. This study establishes the vertebrate hypothalamus as a model for Wnt-regulated postembryonic neural progenitor differentiation and defines specific roles for Wnt signaling in neurogenesis.

Soybean MAPK, GMK1 Is Dually Regulated by Phosphatidic Acid and Hydrogen Peroxide and Translocated to Nucleus during Salt Stress,

Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is activated by various biotic and abiotic stresses. Salt stress induces two well-characterized MAPK activating signaling molecules, phosphatidic acid (PA) via phospholipase D and phospholipase C, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase. In our previous study, the activity of soybean MAPK, GMK1 was strongly induced within 5 min of 300 mM NaCl treatment and this early activity was regulated by PA. In this study, we focused on the regulation of GMK1 at the later stage of the salt stress, because its activity was strongly persistent for up to 30 min. H2O2 activated GMK1 even in the presence of PA generation inhibitors, but GMK1 activity was greatly decreased in the presence of diphenyle-neiodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase after 5 min of the treatment. On the contrary, the n-butanol and neomycin reduced GMK1 activity within 5 min of the treatment. Thus, GMK1 activity may be sustained by H2O2 10 min after the treatment. Further, GMK1 was translocated into the nucleus 60 min after NaCl treatment. In the relationship between GMK1 and ROS generation, ROS generation was reduced by SB202190, a MAPK inhibitor, but was increased in protoplast overexpressing TESD-GMKK1. However, these effects were occurred at prolonged time of NaCl treatment. These data suggest that GMK1 indirectly regulates ROS generation. Taken together, we propose that soybean GMK1 is dually regulated by PA and H2O2 at a time dependant manner and translocated to the nucleus by the salt stress signal.

Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that mitochondria are locally coupled to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release in myoblasts and to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release in differentiated muscle fibers in order to regulate cytoplasmic calcium dynamics and match metabolism with cell activity. However, the mechanism of the developmental transition from ER to SR coupling remains unclear. We have studied mitochondrial sensing of IP3 receptor (IP3R)- and ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated Ca2+ signals in H9c2 myoblasts and differentiating myotubes, as well as the attendant changes in mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondria in myoblasts were largely elongated, luminally connected and relatively few in number, whereas the myotubes were densely packed with globular mitochondria that displayed limited luminal continuity. Vasopressin, an IP3-linked agonist, evoked a large cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) increase in myoblasts, whereas it elicited a smaller response in myotubes. Conversely, RyR-mediated Ca2+ release induced by caffeine, was not observed in myoblasts, but triggered a large [Ca2+]c signal in myotubes. Both the IP3R and the RyR-mediated [Ca2+]c rise was closely associated with a mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) signal. Every myotube that showed a [Ca2+]c spike also displayed a [Ca2+]m response. Addition of IP3 to permeabilized myoblasts and caffeine to permeabilized myotubes also resulted in a rapid [Ca2+]m rise, indicating that Ca2+ was delivered via local coupling of the ER/SR and mitochondria. Thus, as RyRs are expressed during muscle differentiation, the local connection between RyR and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites also appears. When RyR1 was exogenously introduced to myoblasts by overexpression, the [Ca2+]m signal appeared together with the [Ca2+]c signal, however the mitochondrial morphology remained unchanged. Thus, RyR expression alone is sufficient to induce the steps essential for their alignment with mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites, whereas the mitochondrial proliferation and reshaping utilize either downstream or alternative pathways.

Abstract: Summary
We propose that cell-cycle-dependent timing of FEN1 nuclease activity is essential for cell-cycle progression and the maintenance of genome stability. After DNA replication is complete at the exit point of the S phase, removal of excess FEN1 may be crucial. Here, we report a mechanism that controls the programmed degradation of FEN1 via a sequential cascade of posttranslational modifications. We found that FEN1 phosphorylation stimulated its SUMOylation, which in turn stimulated its ubiquitination and ultimately led to its degradation via the proteasome pathway. Mutations or inhibitors that blocked the modification at any step in this pathway suppressed FEN1 degradation. Critically, the presence of SUMOylation- or ubiquitination-defective, nondegradable FEN1 mutant protein caused accumulation of Cyclin B, delays in the G1 and G2/M phases, and polyploidy. These findings may represent a newly identified regulatory mechanism used by cells to ensure precise cell-cycle progression and to prevent transformation.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of cortical interneuron subtypes is controlled by genetic programs that are activated in the ventral forebrain and unfold during the prolonged period of inhibitory neuron development. The LIM-homeodomain protein LHX6 is critical for the development of all cortical interneurons originating in the medial ganglionic eminence, but the molecular mechanisms that operate downstream of LHX6 to control the terminal differentiation of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons within the cortex remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the nuclear matrix and genome organizer protein SATB1 is induced by neuronal activity and functions downstream of Lhx6 to control the transition of tangentially migrating immature interneurons into the terminally differentiated Somatostatin (SST)-expressing subtype. Our experiments provide a molecular framework for understanding the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms by which specified but immature cortical interneurons acquire the subtype-defining molecular and morphophysiological characteristics that allow them to integrate and function within cortical circuits.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental aspect of epithelial homeostasis is the dependence on specific growth factors for cell survival, yet the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We found an “inverse” mode of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling that directly links ErbB receptor inactivation to the induction of apoptosis. Upon ligand deprivation Mig6 dissociates from the ErbB receptor and binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase c-Abl to trigger p73-dependent apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells. Deletion of Errfi1 (encoding Mig6) and inhibition or RNAi silencing of c-Abl causes impaired apoptosis and luminal filling of mammary ducts. Mig6 activates c-Abl by binding to the kinase domain, which is prevented in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) by Src family kinase-mediated phosphorylation on c-Abl-Tyr488. These results reveal a receptor-proximal switch mechanism by which Mig6 actively senses EGF deprivation to directly activate proapoptotic c-Abl. Our findings challenge the common belief that deprivation of growth factors induces apoptosis passively by lack of mitogenic signaling.

Abstract: Summary
In Arabidopsis, transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) can be triggered by 24 nt small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) through the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. By functional analysis of NERD, a GW repeat- and PHD finger-containing protein, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis harbors a second siRNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway targeting a subset of nonconserved genomic loci. The activity of the NERD-dependent pathway differs from RdDM by the fact that it relies both on silencing-related factors previously implicated only in posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), including RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE1/6 and ARGONAUTE2, and most likely on 21 nt siRNAs. A central role for NERD in integrating RNA silencing and chromatin signals in transcriptional silencing is supported by data showing that it binds both to histone H3 and AGO2 proteins and contributes to siRNA accumulation at a NERD-targeted locus. Our results unravel the existence of a conserved chromatin-based RNA silencing pathway encompassing both PTGS and TGS components in plants.

Abstract: Ginseng has been shown to have memory-improving effects in human. However, little is known about the active components and the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects. Recently, we isolated novel lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs)-ginseng protein complex derived from ginseng, gintonin. Gintonin activates G protein-coupled LPA receptors with high affinity. Gintonin activated Ca2+-activated Cl- channels in Xenopus oocytes through the activation of endogenous LPA receptor. In the present study, we investigated whether the activation of LPA receptor by gintonin is coupled to the regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor channel activity in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat NMDA receptors. The NMDA receptor-mediated ion current (INMDA) was measured using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. In oocytes injected with cRNAs encoding NMDA receptor subunits, gintonin enhanced INMDA in a concentration-dependent manner. Gintonin-mediated INMDA enhancement was blocked by Ki16425, an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist. Gintonin action was blocked by a PLC inhibitor, IP3 receptor antagonist, Ca2+ chelator, and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The site-directed mutation of Ser1308 of the NMDA receptor, which is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC), to an Ala residue, or co-expression of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase with the NMDA receptor attenuated gintonin action. Moreover, gintonin treatment elicited a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i in cultured hippocampal neurons and elevated longterm potentiation (LTP) in both concentration-dependent manners in rat hippocampal slices. Gintonin-mediated LTP induction was abolished by Ki16425. These results indicate that gintonin-mediated INMDA potentiation and LTP induction in the hippocampus via the activation of LPA receptor might be responsible for ginseng-mediated improvement of memory-related brain functions.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acids control cell growth via activation of the highly conserved kinase TORC1. Glutamine is a particularly important amino acid in cell growth control and metabolism. However, the role of glutamine in TORC1 activation remains poorly defined. Glutamine is metabolized through glutaminolysis to produce α-ketoglutarate. We demonstrate that glutamine in combination with leucine activates mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) by enhancing glutaminolysis and α-ketoglutarate production. Inhibition of glutaminolysis prevented GTP loading of RagB and lysosomal translocation and subsequent activation of mTORC1. Constitutively active Rag heterodimer activated mTORC1 in the absence of glutaminolysis. Conversely, enhanced glutaminolysis or a cell-permeable α-ketoglutarate analog stimulated lysosomal translocation and activation of mTORC1. Finally, cell growth and autophagy, two processes controlled by mTORC1, were regulated by glutaminolysis. Thus, mTORC1 senses and is activated by glutamine and leucine via glutaminolysis and α-ketoglutarate production upstream of Rag. This may provide an explanation for glutamine addiction in cancer cells.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease in the vessel wall. Nicotine, a major component of cigarette smoke, is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis. As an inflammatory molecule, C-reactive protein (CRP) participates in atherogenesis. Although it has been confirmed that CRP level in smoking patient is significantly higher than non-smokers and cigarette withdrawal, it is unknown whether nicotine induces CRP expression in macrophages. The present study was to observe effect of nicotine on CRP production and the related signal pathway in U937 macrophages. The results showed that nicotine significantly increased mRNA and protein expression of CRP in U937 macrophages in time- and concentration-dependent ways. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) blocker hexamethonium, MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and NF-κB inhibitor PDTC almost completely abolished nicotine-induced CRP expression in mRNA and protein levels in U937 macrophages. The further study indicated that hexa-methonium, PD98059, and SB203580 significantly inhibited ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. These demonstrate that nicotine has ability to induce CRP expression in macrophages through nAChR-ERK1/2/p38 MAPK-NF-κB signal pathway, which contributes to better understanding of the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherosclerotic effects of nicotine in cigarette smokers.

Abstract: Summary
Studying ciliopathies, like the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), allow the identification of signaling pathways potentially involved in common diseases, sharing phenotypic features like obesity or type 2 diabetes. Given the close association between obesity and insulin resistance, obese BBS patients would be expected to be insulin resistant. Surprisingly, we found that a majority of obese BBS patients retained normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Patient’s adipose tissue biopsies revealed upregulation of adipogenic genes and decrease of inflammatory mediators. In vitro studies on human primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) showed that BBS12 inactivation facilitated adipogenesis, increased insulin sensitivity, and glucose utilization. We generated a Bbs12−/− mouse model to assess the impact of Bbs12 inactivation on adipocyte biology. Despite increased obesity, glucose tolerance was increased with specific enhanced insulin sensitivity in the fat. This correlated with an active recruitment of MSCs resulting in adipose tissue hyperplasia and decreased in inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells consume large quantities of nutrients and maintain high levels of anabolism. Recent studies revealed that various oncogenic pathways are involved in modulation of metabolism. Nrf2, a key regulator for the maintenance of redox homeostasis, has been shown to contribute to malignant phenotypes of cancers including aggressive proliferation. However, the mechanisms with which Nrf2 accelerates proliferation are not fully understood. Here, we show that Nrf2 redirects glucose and glutamine into anabolic pathways, especially under the sustained activation of PI3K-Akt signaling. The active PI3K-Akt pathway augments the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and enables Nrf2 to promote metabolic activities that support cell proliferation in addition to enhancing cytoprotection. The functional expansion of Nrf2 reinforces the metabolic reprogramming triggered by proliferative signals.

Abstract: Summary
The glycosphingolipid GM1 binds cholera toxin (CT) on host cells and carries it retrograde from the plasma membrane (PM) through endosomes, the trans-Golgi (TGN), and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to induce toxicity. To elucidate how a membrane lipid can specify trafficking in these pathways, we synthesized GM1 isoforms with alternate ceramide domains and imaged their trafficking in live cells. Only GM1 with unsaturated acyl chains sorted efficiently from PM to TGN and ER. Toxin binding, which effectively crosslinks GM1 lipids, was dispensable, but membrane cholesterol and the lipid raft-associated proteins actin and flotillin were required. The results implicate a protein-dependent mechanism of lipid sorting by ceramide structure and provide a molecular explanation for the diversity and specificity of retrograde trafficking by CT in host cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cells have evolved numerous mechanisms to circumvent stresses caused by the environment, and many of them are regulated by the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). Unlike most organisms, C. elegans AMPK-null mutants are viable, but they die prematurely in the “long-lived” dauer stage due to exhaustion of triglyceride stores. Using a genome-wide RNAi approach, we demonstrate that the disruption of genes that increase hydrogen peroxide levels enhance the survival of AMPK mutant dauers by altering both the abundance and the nature of the fatty-acid content in the animal by increasing the HIF-1-dependent expression of several key enzymes involved in fatty-acid biosynthesis. Our data provide a mechanistic foundation to explain how an optimal level of an often vilified ROS-generating compound such as hydrogen peroxide can provide cellular benefit, a phenomenon described as hormesis, by instructing cells to readjust their lipid biosynthetic capacity through downstream HIF-1 activation to correct cellular energy deficiencies.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine acetylation is a major posttranslational modification involved in a broad array of physiological functions. Here, we provide an organ-wide map of lysine acetylation sites from 16 rat tissues analyzed by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. We quantify 15,474 modification sites on 4,541 proteins and provide the data set as a web-based database. We demonstrate that lysine acetylation displays site-specific sequence motifs that diverge between cellular compartments, with a significant fraction of nuclear sites conforming to the consensus motifs G-AcK and AcK-P. Our data set reveals that the subcellular acetylation distribution is tissue-type dependent and that acetylation targets tissue-specific pathways involved in fundamental physiological processes. We compare lysine acetylation patterns for rat as well as human skeletal muscle biopsies and demonstrate its general involvement in muscle contraction. Furthermore, we illustrate that acetylation of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase serves as a cellular mechanism to switch off enzymatic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Cilia control homeostasis of the mammalian body by generating fluid flow. It has long been assumed that ciliary length-control mechanisms are essential for proper flow generation, because fluid flow generation is a function of ciliary length. However, the molecular mechanisms of ciliary length control in mammals remain elusive. Here, we suggest that KIF19A, a member of the kinesin superfamily, regulates ciliary length by depolymerizing microtubules at the tips of cilia. Kif19a−/− mice displayed hydrocephalus and female infertility phenotypes due to abnormally elongated cilia that cannot generate proper fluid flow. KIF19A localized to cilia tips, and recombinant KIF19A controlled the length of microtubules polymerized from axonemes in vitro. KIF19A had ATP-dependent microtubule-depolymerizing activity mainly at the plus end of microtubules. Our results indicated a molecular mechanism of ciliary length regulation in mammals, which plays an important role in the maintenance of the mammalian body.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of the kinase MAP3K4 causes mouse embryonic gonadal sex reversal due to reduced expression of the testis-determining gene, Sry. However, because of widespread expression of MAP3K4, the cellular basis of this misregulation was unclear. Here, we show that mice lacking Gadd45γ also exhibit XY gonadal sex reversal caused by disruption to Sry expression. Gadd45γ is expressed in a dynamic fashion in somatic cells of the developing gonads from 10.5 days postcoitum (dpc) to 12.5 dpc. Gadd45γ and Map3k4 genetically interact during sex determination, and transgenic overexpression of Map3k4 rescues gonadal defects in Gadd45γ-deficient embryos. Sex reversal in both mutants is associated with reduced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and GATA4. In addition, embryos lacking both p38α and p38β also exhibit XY gonadal sex reversal. Taken together, our data suggest a requirement for GADD45γ in promoting MAP3K4-mediated activation of p38 MAPK signaling in embryonic gonadal somatic cells for testis determination in the mouse.

Abstract: TIP30 (30 kDa HIV-1 TAT-interacting protein), also called HTATIP2 or CC3, is a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an angiogenesis inhibitor. TIP30 blocks nuclear import of the mRNA-binding protein HuR, and thereby promotes the cytoplasmic accumulation of HuR by binding to importin-β, which is known to facilitate the cytoplasm-to-nuclear transport of HuR. Accumulation of HuR in the cytoplasm, in turn, enhances the expression of the transcription factor p53, a tumor suppressor that plays an essential role in preserving genome stability and inhibiting cancer growth. In addition to such a post-transcriptional mechanism via which TIP30 increases the p53 level, it has been proposed that TIP30 may regulate p53 protein at the protein level by directly binding to it. In order to investigate the possibility of direct interaction between p53 and TIP30, we have used on three functional regions in p53 and examined their interactions with TIP30 using GST pull-down assay and surface plasmon resonance technique. The results show that that TIP30 binds to the DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal domain of p53.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of genes that initiate and amplify inflammatory programs of gene expression is achieved by signal-dependent exchange of coregulator complexes that function to read, write, and erase specific histone modifications linked to transcriptional activation or repression. Here, we provide evidence for the role of trimethylated histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me3) as a repression checkpoint that restricts expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) target genes in macrophages. H4K20me3 is deposited at the promoters of a subset of these genes by the SMYD5 histone methyltransferase through its association with NCoR corepressor complexes. Signal-dependent erasure of H4K20me3 is required for effective gene activation and is achieved by NF-κB-dependent delivery of the histone demethylase PHF2. Liver X receptors antagonize TLR4-dependent gene activation by maintaining NCoR/SMYD5-mediated repression. These findings reveal a histone H4K20 trimethylation/demethylation strategy that integrates positive and negative signaling inputs that control immunity and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The proapoptotic death receptor DR5 has been studied extensively in cancer cells, but its action in the tumor microenvironment is not well defined. Here, we uncover a role for DR5 signaling in tumor endothelial cells (ECs). We detected DR5 expression in ECs within tumors but not normal tissues. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with an oligomeric form of the DR5 ligand Apo2L/TRAIL induced apoptosis in tumor ECs, collapsing blood vessels and reducing tumor growth: Vascular disruption and antitumor activity required DR5 expression on tumor ECs but not malignant cells. These results establish a therapeutic paradigm for proapoptotic receptor agonists as selective tumor vascular disruption agents, providing an alternative, perhaps complementary, strategy to their use as activators of apoptosis in malignant cells.

Abstract: Summary
A group of genes that are highly and specifically expressed in proliferating skeletal myoblasts during myogenesis was identified. Expression of one of these genes, Hmga2, increases coincident with satellite cell activation, and later its expression significantly declines correlating with fusion of myoblasts into myotubes. Hmga2 knockout mice exhibit impaired muscle development and reduced myoblast proliferation, while overexpression of HMGA2 promotes myoblast growth. This perturbation in proliferation can be explained by the finding that HMGA2 directly regulates the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2. Add-back of IGF2BP2 rescues the phenotype. IGF2BP2 in turn binds to and controls the translation of a set of mRNAs, including c-myc, Sp1, and Igf1r. These data demonstrate that the HMGA2-IGF2BP2 axis functions as a key regulator of satellite cell activation and therefore skeletal muscle development.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA exosome is an essential multisubunit ribonuclease (RNase) that contributes to cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA decay and quality control. The 9-subunit exosome core (Exo9) features a prominent central channel formed by stacked asymmetric rings of six RNase PH-like proteins and three S1/KH domain proteins. Exo9 is catalytically inert but associates with Rrp44, an endoribonuclease and processive 3′→5′ exoribonuclease, and Rrp6, a distributive 3′→5′ exoribonuclease. We show that Exo9 and its central channel modulate all three yeast exosome RNase activities because channel occlusion attenuates RNA binding and RNase activities in vitro and fails to complement exosome functions in vivo. We find that Rrp6 stimulates Rrp44 RNase activities and that Rrp6 is inhibited by a mutation in the Rrp44 exoribonuclease active site in 11-subunit nuclear exosomes. These results suggest the exosome core and central channel is essential because it modulates each of the known RNase activities of the yeast RNA exosome.

Abstract: Summary
Genes mutated in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) interact with the DNA repair genes BRCA1 and BRCA2/FANCD1 to suppress tumorigenesis, but the molecular functions ascribed to them cannot fully explain all of their cellular roles. Here, we show a repair-independent requirement for FA genes, including FANCD2, and BRCA1 in protecting stalled replication forks from degradation. Fork protection is surprisingly rescued in FANCD2-deficient cells by elevated RAD51 levels or stabilized RAD51 filaments. Moreover, FANCD2-mediated fork protection is epistatic with RAD51 functions, revealing an unanticipated fork protection pathway that connects FA genes to RAD51 and the BRCA1/2 breast cancer suppressors. Collective results imply a unified molecular mechanism for repair-independent functions of FA, RAD51, and BRCA1/2 proteins in preventing genomic instability and suppressing tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Excess adipose tissue is associated with metabolic disease and reduced life span, whereas caloric restriction decreases these risks. Here we show that as mice age, there is downregulation of Dicer and miRNA processing in adipose tissue resulting in decreases of multiple miRNAs. A similar decline of Dicer with age is observed in C. elegans. This is prevented in both species by caloric restriction. Decreased Dicer expression also occurs in preadipocytes from elderly humans and can be produced in cells by exposure to oxidative stress or UV radiation. Knockdown of Dicer in cells results in premature senescence, and fat-specific Dicer knockout renders mice hypersensitive to oxidative stress. Finally, Dicer loss-of-function mutations in worms reduce life span and stress tolerance, while intestinal overexpression of Dicer confers stress resistance. Thus, regulation of miRNA processing in adipose-related tissues plays an important role in longevity and the ability of an organism to respond to environmental stress and age-related disease.

Abstract: In skeletal muscles from patient suffering of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and from mdx mice, the absence of the cytoskeleton protein dystrophin has been shown to be essential for maintaining a normal calcium influx. We showed that a TRPC store-dependent cation influx is increased by loss of dystrophin or a scaffolding protein α1-syntrophin, however the mechanisms of this calcium mishandling are incompletely understood. First of all, we confirmed that TRPC1 but also STIM1 and Orai1 are supporting the store-operated cation entry which is enhanced in dystrophin-deficient myotubes. Next, we demonstrated that inhibition of PLC or PKC in dystrophin-deficient myotubes restores elevated cation entry to normal levels similarly to enforced minidystrophin expression. In addition, silencing α1-syntrophin also increased cation influx in a PLC/PKC dependent pathway. We also showed that α1-syntrophin and PLCβ are part of a same protein complex reinforcing the idea of their inter-relation in calcium influx regulation. This elevated cation entry was decreased to normal levels by chelating intracellular free calcium with BAPTA-AM. Double treatments with BAPTA-AM and PLC or PKC inhibitors suggested that the elevation of cation influx by PLC/PKC pathway is dependent on cytosolic calcium. All these results demonstrate an involvement in dystrophin-deficient myotubes of a specific calcium/PKC/PLC pathway in elevation of store-operated cation influx supported by the STIM1/Orai1/TRPC1 proteins, which is normally regulated by the α1-syntrophin/dystrophin scaffold.

Abstract: Tsip1, a Zn finger protein that was isolated as a direct interactor with tobacco stress-induced 1 (Tsi1), plays an important role in both biotic and abiotic stress signaling. To further understand Tsip1 function, we searched for more Tsip1-interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening using a tobacco cDNA library. Screening identified a new Tsip1-interacting protein, Nicotiana tabacumTsip1-interacting ferredoxin 1 (NtTfd1), and binding specificity was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. The four repeats of a cysteine-rich motif (CXXCXGXG) of Tsip1 proved important for binding to NtTfd1. Virus-induced gene silencing of NtTfd1, Tsip1, and NtTfd1/Tsip1 rendered plants more susceptible to salinity stress compared with TRV2 control plants. NtTfd1- and Tsip1-silenced tobacco plants were more susceptible to infection by Cucumber mosaic virus compared with control plants. These results suggest that NtTfd1 might be involved in the regulation of biotic and abiotic stresses in chloroplasts by interaction with Tsip1.

Abstract: Summary
Hemogenic endothelium (HE) has been recognized as a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the embryo. Access to human HE progenitors (HEPs) is essential for enabling the investigation of the molecular determinants of HSC specification. Here, we show that HEPs capable of generating definitive hematopoietic cells can be obtained from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and identified precisely by a VE-cadherin+CD73−CD235a/CD43− phenotype. This phenotype discriminates true HEPs from VE-cadherin+CD73+ non-HEPs and VE-cadherin+CD235a+CD41a− early hematopoietic cells with endothelial and FGF2-dependent hematopoietic colony-forming potential. We found that HEPs arise at the post-primitive-streak stage of differentiation directly from VE-cadherin-negative KDRbrightAPLNR+PDGFRαlow/− hematovascular mesodermal precursors (HVMPs). In contrast, hemangioblasts, which are capable of forming endothelium and primitive blood cells, originate from more immature APLNR+PDGFRα+ mesoderm. The demarcation of HEPs and HVMPs provides a platform for modeling blood development from endothelium with a goal of facilitating the generation of HSCs from hPSCs.

Abstract: The effect of alpha-N-acetylation (Nt-acetylation) on the properties of parvalbumin (PA), a Ca2+-binding relaxing factor of skeletal muscles and major food allergen, has been explored. Intact PA contains an N-terminal acetyl group which is absent in the protein expressed in Escherichia coli (rWT), as confirmed by mass spectrometry. Compared to intact pike α-PA, its rWT form exhibits essentially altered profile of thermal unfolding, lowered α-helicity, and decreased affinities to Ca2+ and Mg2+. The structural destabilization of the rWT protein results in lowered resistance to chymotryptic digestion and increased propensity to oligomerization. The rate constants of Ca2+ dissociation from the rWT PA are markedly increased, which indicates that Nt-acetylation modifies functional status of the protein. Rat α-PA demonstrates similar properties for intact and rWT forms. The drastic difference in the effects induced by Nt-acetylation in the PA orthologs can be rationalized by higher disorder level of AB domain in pike PA. Though evolution of PA's genes resulted in the protein sequences with highly divergent properties, Nt-acetylation unifies their functional properties. The structural stability conferred to PA by Nt-acetylation may contribute to its allergenicity. Overall, Nt-acetylation is shown to be a prerequisite for maintenance of structural and functional status of some parvalbumins.

Abstract: In order to investigate the role of thymic epithelial cell (TEC) subsets during T-cell development, we established a new transgenic system, enabling inducible cell-specific ablation as well as marking the TEC subsets using bicistronic bacterial nitroreductase and EGFP genes. Two different lengths of the TSCOT promoter in transgenic mice, named 3.1T-NE and 9.1T-NE, drive EGFP expression into TECs. In adult life, EGFP expression was located in the medulla with a smaller 3.1 kb TSCOT promoter, while it was maintained in the cortex with a 9.1 kb promoter, suggesting putative TEC specific as well as compartment specific cis elements within two promoters. Nitroreductase induced cell death was specific without bystander killing upon the treatment of prodrugs such as nitrofurantoin and metronidazol. The degree of cell death was dependent on the dose of the prodrug in the cell and the fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOCs). Fetal thymic stromal populations were analyzed based on the expression levels of EpCAM, MHCII, CDR1 and/or UEA-1. EGFP expression patterns varied among subsets indicating the differential TSCOT promoter activity in each TEC subset. Prodrug treatment in FTOCs reduced the numbers of total and subsets of thymocytes. A CD4+CD8+ double positive cell population was highly susceptible in both transgenic lines. Surprisingly, there was a distinct reduction in γδ T cell population only in the 9.1T-NE thymus, indicating that they require a NTR-EGFP expressing TEC population. Therefore, these results support a division of labor within TEC subsets for the αβ and γδ lineage specification.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), a cochaperone that organizes other chaperones, heat shock proteins (HSPs), was recently shown to be secreted by human ovarian cancer cells. In neuronal tissues, binding to prion protein was required for STIP1 to activate the ERK (extracellular-regulated MAP kinase) signaling pathways. However, we report that STIP1 binding to a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK2 (activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 2), was necessary and sufficient to stimulate proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. The binding of STIP1 to ALK2 activated the SMAD signaling pathway, leading to transcriptional activation of ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3), promoting cell proliferation. In conclusion, ovarian-cancer-tissue-secreted STIP1 stimulates cancer cell proliferation by binding to ALK2 and activating the SMAD-ID3 signaling pathways. Although animal studies are needed to confirm these mechanisms in vivo, our results may pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Dissecting the role of insulin in the complex regulation of triglyceride metabolism is necessary for understanding dyslipidemia and steatosis. Liver insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice show that in the physiological context of feeding, hepatic insulin signaling is not required for the induction of mTORC1, an upstream activator of the lipogenic regulator, SREBP-1c. Feeding induces SREBP-1c mRNA in LIRKO livers, though not to the extent observed in controls. A high fructose diet also partially induces SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression in LIRKO livers. Insulin signaling becomes more important in the pathological context of obesity, as knockdown of the insulin receptor in ob/ob mice, a model of Type 2 diabetes, using antisense oligonucleotides, abolishes the induction of SREBP-1c and its targets by obesity and ameliorates steatosis. Thus, insulin-independent signaling pathways can partially compensate for insulin in the induction of SREBP-1c by feeding but the further induction by obesity/Type 2 diabetes is entirely dependent upon insulin.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular signatures have identified several subsets of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and rational targets within the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling axis. The OxPhos-DLBCL subset, which harbors the signature of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, is insensitive to inhibition of BCR survival signaling but is functionally undefined. We show that, compared with BCR-DLBCLs, OxPhos-DLBCLs display enhanced mitochondrial energy transduction, greater incorporation of nutrient-derived carbons into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and increased glutathione levels. Moreover, perturbation of the fatty acid oxidation program and glutathione synthesis proved selectively toxic to this tumor subset. Our analysis provides evidence for distinct metabolic fingerprints and associated survival mechanisms in DLBCL and may have therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
The NF-κB transcription factor controls diverse biological processes. According to the classical model, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm of resting cells via binding to inhibitory, IκB proteins and translocates into the nucleus upon their ligand-induced degradation. Here we reveal that Sef, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of growth factor signaling, is a spatial regulator of NF-κB. Sef expression is regulated by the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, and Sef specifically inhibits “classical” NF-κB (p50:p65) activation by these ligands. Like IκBs, Sef sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm of resting cells. However, contrary to IκBs, Sef continues to constrain NF-κB nuclear entry upon ligand stimulation. Accordingly, endogenous Sef knockdown markedly enhances stimulus-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation and consequent activity. This study establishes Sef as a feedback antagonist of proinflammatory cytokines and highlights its potential to regulate the crosstalk between proinflammatory cytokine receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases.

Abstract: Summary
Disruption of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor is associated with structural and numerical chromosomal defects. The numerical abnormalities in BRCA2-deficient cells may partly result from aberrations in cell division caused by disruption of BRCA2 during cytokinesis. Here we show that BRCA2 is a component of the midbody that is recruited through an interaction with Filamin A actin-binding protein. At the midbody, BRCA2 influences the recruitment of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-associated proteins, Alix and Tsg101, and formation of CEP55-Alix and CEP55-Tsg101 complexes during abscission. Disruption of these BRCA2 interactions by cancer-associated mutations results in increased cytokinetic defects but has no effect on BRCA2-dependent homologous recombination repair of DNA damage. These findings identify a specific role for BRCA2 in the regulation of midbody structure and function, separate from DNA damage repair, that may explain in part the whole-chromosomal instability in BRCA2-deficient tumors.

Abstract: This study was to determine the lethal dose 50 (LD50) of CdCl2 in adult Rhinella arenarum and analyzed the effect of two sublethal doses (0.5 and 5mg/kg) of the xenobiotic in gonads. The 48h LD50 were 50.0 and 49.8mg/kg for males and females respectively. Alterations in the ovary were evidenced by nuclear pleomorphism and cytoplasmic vacuolization of the oocytes at the early stages of development with the highest dose and an increase in the population of atretic oocytes. In the interstitial tissue we noticed congestion, edema and fibroblast proliferation. The nuclear maturation of the oocytes was affected by the xenobiotic in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In males, treatment with 5mg/kg of cadmium (Cd) caused a decrease in the concentration, viability and straight progressive motility of sperm while there was an increase in immotile sperm. Testis histopathology revealed dilated seminiferous tubules, disappearance of cysts, tissue disorganization and leukocyte infiltration. Numerous germ cells showed hydropic tumefaction or signs of focal necrosis. The Cd content in animals intoxicated gonads with the highest sublethal dose was significantly higher than in the control. Results indicate that R. arenarum gonads are target for the xenobiotic, compromising the formation of gametes competent for fertilization, the effective CdCl2 dose being 5mg/kg.

Abstract: Changes in PMCA2 and PMCA3 expression during neuronal development are tightly linked to structural and functional modifications in Ca2+ handling machinery. Using antisense strategy we obtained stably transfected PC12 lines with reduced level of PMCA2 or PMCA3, which were then subjected to dibutyryl-cAMP differentiation. Reduced level of neuron-specific PMCAs led to acceleration of differentiation and formation of longer neurites than in control PC12 line. Treatment with dibutyryl-cAMP was associated with retraction of growth cones and intensified formation of varicosities. In PMCA2-reduced cells development of apoptosis and DNA laddering were detected. Higher amounts of constitutive isoforms PMCA1 and PMCA4, their putative extended location to gaps left after partial removal of PMCA2 or PMCA3, together with increased SERCA may indicate the induction of compensatory mechanism in modified cells. Functional studies showed altered expression of certain types of VDCCs in PMCA-reduced cells, which correlated with their higher contribution to Ca2+ influx. The cell response to PMCAs suppression suggests the interplay between transcription level of two opposite calcium-transporting systems i.e. voltage- and store depletion-activated channels facilitating Ca2+ influx and calcium pumps responsible for Ca2+ clearance, as well highlights the role of both neuron-specific PMCA isoforms in the control of PC12 cells differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Here we identify a key role for the homeodomain proteins Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth) in the specification of muscle fiber fate in Drosophila. exd and hth are expressed in the fibrillar indirect flight muscles but not in tubular jump muscles, and manipulating exd or hth expression converts one muscle type into the other. In the flight muscles, exd and hth are genetically upstream of another muscle identity gene, salm, and are direct transcriptional regulators of the signature flight muscle structural gene, Actin88F. Exd and Hth also impact muscle identity in other somatic muscles of the body by cooperating with Hox factors. Because mammalian orthologs of exd and hth also contribute to muscle gene regulation, our studies suggest that an evolutionarily conserved genetic pathway determines muscle fiber differentiation.

Abstract: The dynamics of human and animal adipogenesis has been defined using several traditional cell systems including stromal vascular cells and adipocyte-related cell lines. But a relatively new cell system using progeny cells stemming from the dedifferentiation of purified cultures of mature adipocytes may be used for studying the development and biology of adipocytes. In this research, we show that isolated (and purified) mature adipocytes derived from Wagyu cattle dedifferentiate into progeny cells, and that these spindle-shaped, proliferative-competent daughter cells possess ability to proliferate. We outline the optimum cell culture system and offer precautionary thoughts for effective mature adipocyte culture. Collectively, this represents a novel cell model which may provide new insights into cell development, physiology and use as a model for animal production/composition, tissue engineering and disease treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The Fanconi anemia (FA) protein network is necessary for repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), but its control mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that the network is regulated by a ubiquitin signaling cascade initiated by RNF8 and its partner, UBC13, and mediated by FAAP20, a component of the FA core complex. FAAP20 preferentially binds the ubiquitin product of RNF8-UBC13, and this ubiquitin-binding activity and RNF8-UBC13 are both required for recruitment of FAAP20 to ICLs. Both RNF8 and FAAP20 are required for recruitment of FA core complex and FANCD2 to ICLs, whereas RNF168 can modulate efficiency of the recruitment. RNF8 and FAAP20 are needed for efficient FANCD2 monoubiquitination, a key step of the FA network; RNF8 and the FA core complex work in the same pathway to promote cellular resistance to ICLs. Thus, the RNF8-FAAP20 ubiquitin cascade is critical for recruiting FA core complex to ICLs and for normal function of the FA network.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic regulation may involve heritable chromatin states, but how chromatin features can be inherited through DNA replication is incompletely understood. We address this question using cell-free replication of chromatin. Previously, we showed that a Polycomb group complex, PRC1, remains continuously associated with chromatin through DNA replication. Here we investigate the mechanism of persistence. We find that a single PRC1 subunit, Posterior sex combs (PSC), can reconstitute persistence through DNA replication. PSC binds nucleosomes and self-interacts, bridging nucleosomes into a stable, oligomeric structure. Within these structures, individual PSC-chromatin contacts are dynamic. Stable association of PSC with chromatin, including through DNA replication, depends on PSC-PSC interactions. Our data suggest that labile individual PSC-chromatin contacts allow passage of the DNA replication machinery while PSC-PSC interactions prevent PSC from dissociating, allowing it to rebind to replicated chromatin. This mechanism may allow inheritance of chromatin proteins including PRC1 through DNA replication to maintain chromatin states.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated expression of FoxM1 in breast cancer correlates with an undifferentiated tumor phenotype and a negative clinical outcome. However, a role for FoxM1 in regulating mammary differentiation was not known. Here, we identify another function of FoxM1, the ability to act as a transcriptional repressor, which plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of luminal epithelial progenitors. Regeneration of mammary glands with elevated levels of FoxM1 leads to aberrant ductal morphology and expansion of the luminal progenitor pool. Conversely, knockdown of FoxM1 results in a shift toward the differentiated state. FoxM1 mediates these effects by repressing the key regulator of luminal differentiation, GATA-3. Through association with DNMT3b, FoxM1 promotes methylation of the GATA-3 promoter in an Rb-dependent manner. This study identifies FoxM1 as a critical regulator of mammary differentiation with significant implications for the development of aggressive breast cancers.

Abstract: The formation of γ-H2AX foci after DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for the cellular response to this lethal DNA damage. We previously have shown that BRG1, a chromatin remodeling enzyme, facilitates DSB repair by stimulating γ-H2AX formation, and this function of BRG1 requires the binding of BRGI to acetylated histone H3 on γ-H2AX-containing nucleosomes using its bromodomain (BRD), a protein module that specifically recognizes acetyl-Lys moieties. We also have shown that the BRD of BRG1, when ectopically expressed in cells, functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of the BRG1 activity to stimulate γ-H2AX and DSB repair. Here, we found that BRDs from a select group of proteins have no such activity, suggesting that the γ-H2AX inhibition activity of BRG1 BRD is specific. This finding led us to search for more BRDs that exhibit γ-H2AX inhibition activity in the hope of finding additional BRD-containing proteins involved in DNA damage responses. We screened a total of 52 individual BRDs present in 38 human BRD-containing proteins, comprising 93% of all human BRDs. We identified the BRD of cat eye syndrome chromosome region candidate 2 (Cecr2), which recently was shown to form a novel chromatin remodeling complex with unknown cellular functions, as having a strong γ-H2AX inhibition activity. This activity of Cecr2 BRD is specific because it depends on the chromatin binding affinity of Cecr2 BRD. Small interfering RNA knockdown experiments showed that Cecr2 is important for γ-H2AX formation and DSB repair. Therefore, our genomewide screen identifies Cecr2 as a novel DNA damage response protein.

Abstract: Summary
How nascent polypeptides emerging from ribosomes fold into functional structures is poorly understood. Here, we monitor disulfide bond formation, protease resistance, and enzymatic activity in nascent polypeptides to show that in close proximity to the ribosome, conformational space and kinetics of folding are restricted. Folding constraints decrease incrementally with distance from the ribosome surface. Upon ribosome binding, the chaperone Trigger Factor counters folding also of longer nascent chains, to extents varying between different chain segments. Trigger Factor even binds and unfolds pre-existing folded structures, the unfolding activity being limited by the thermodynamic stability of nascent chains. Folding retardation and unfolding activities are not shared by the DnaK chaperone assisting later folding steps. These ribosome- and Trigger Factor-specific activities together constitute an efficient mechanism to prevent or even revert premature folding, effectively limiting misfolded intermediates during protein synthesis.

Abstract: The spatiotemporal dynamics of elementary Ca2+ release events, such as “blips” and “puffs” shapes the hierarchal Ca2+ signaling in many cell types. Despite being the building blocks of Ca2+ patterning, the mechanism responsible for the observed properties of puffs, especially their termination is incompletely understood. In this paper, we employ a data-driven approach to gain insights into the complex dynamics of blips and puffs. We use a model of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) derived directly from single channel patch clamp data taken at 10μM concentration of IP3 to simulate calcium puffs. We first reproduce recent observations regarding puffs and blips and then investigate the mechanism of puff termination. Our model suggests that during a puff, IP3R s proceed around a loop through kinetic states from “rest” to “open” to “inhibited” and back to “rest”. A puff terminates because of self-inhibition. Based on our simulations, we rule out the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ depletion as a possible cause for puff termination. The data-driven approach also enables us to estimate the current through a single IP3R and the peak Ca2+ concentration near the channel pore.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we have investigated the role of the Notch pathway in the generation and maintenance of KrasG12V-driven non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We demonstrate by genetic means that γ-secretase and RBPJ are essential for the formation of NSCLCs. Of importance, pharmacologic treatment of mice carrying autochthonous NSCLCs with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) blocks cancer growth. Treated carcinomas present reduced HES1 levels and reduced phosphorylated ERK without changes in phosphorylated MEK. Mechanistically, we show that HES1 directly binds to and represses the promoter of DUSP1, encoding a dual phosphatase that is active against phospho-ERK. Accordingly, GSI treatment upregulates DUSP1 and decreases phospho-ERK. These data provide proof of the in vivo therapeutic potential of GSIs in primary NSCLCs.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying loci with parental differences in DNA methylation is key to unraveling parent-of-origin phenotypes. By conducting a MeDIP-Seq screen in maternal-methylation free postimplantation mouse embryos (Dnmt3L-/+), we demonstrate that maternal-specific methylation exists very scarcely at midgestation. We reveal two forms of oocyte-specific methylation inheritance: limited to preimplantation, or with longer duration, i.e. maternally imprinted loci. Transient and imprinted maternal germline DMRs (gDMRs) are indistinguishable in gametes and preimplantation embryos, however, de novo methylation of paternal alleles at implantation delineates their fates and acts as a major leveling factor of parent-inherited differences. We characterize two new imprinted gDMRs, at the Cdh15 and AK008011 loci, with tissue-specific imprinting loss, again by paternal methylation gain. Protection against demethylation after fertilization has been emphasized as instrumental in maintaining parent-of-origin methylation inherited from the gametes. Here we provide evidence that protection against de novo methylation acts as an equal major pivot, at implantation and throughout life.

Abstract: Summary
Secreted signaling molecules typically float in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or freely diffuse away from the signaling cell, suggesting that a signal should be sensed equally by all neighboring cells. However, we demonstrate that Spitz (Spi)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is spatially biased to selectively determine the induction of a single bract cell on the proximal side of each mechanosensory organ on the Drosophila leg. Dynamic and oriented cellular protrusions emanating from the socket cell, the source of Spi, robustly favor the Spi/EGFR signaling response in a particular cell among equally competent neighbors. We propose that these protrusive structures enhance signaling by increasing contact between the signaling and responding cells. The planar polarized direction of the protrusions determines the direction of the signaling outcome. This asymmetric cell signaling serves as a developmental mechanism to generate spatially patterned cell fates.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that Notch signaling not only regulates the number of early differentiating neurons, but also maintains proliferating neural precursors in the neural tube. Although it is well known that Notch signaling is closely related to the differentiation of adult neural stem cells, none of transgenic zebrafish provides a tool to figure out the relationship between Notch signaling and the differentiation of neural precursors. The goal of this study was to characterize Her4-positive cells by comparing the expression of a fluorescent Her4 reporter in Tg[her4-dRFP] animals with a GFAP reporter in Tg[gfap-GFP] adult zebrafish. BrdU incorporation indicated that dRFP-positive cells were proliferating and a double labeling assay revealed that a significant fraction of the Her4-dRFP positive population was also GFAP-GFP positive. Our observations suggest that a reporter line with Notch-dependent gene expression can provide a tool to examine proliferating neural precursors and/or neuronal/glial precursors in the development of the adult nervous system to examine the model in which Notch signaling maintains proliferating neural precursors in the neural tube.

Abstract: Summary
To define the mutation spectrum in non-Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (non-DS-AMKL), we performed transcriptome sequencing on diagnostic blasts from 14 pediatric patients and validated our findings in a recurrency/validation cohort consisting of 34 pediatric and 28 adult AMKL samples. Our analysis identified a cryptic chromosome 16 inversion (inv(16)(p13.3q24.3)) in 27% of pediatric cases, which encodes a CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion protein. Expression of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 in Drosophila and murine hematopoietic cells induced bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling and resulted in a marked increase in the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic progenitors. These data suggest that expression of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 directly contributes to leukemogenesis.

Abstract: Growth factors and hormones have both short- and long-term regulatory effects on the functional expression of voltage gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels. In particular, it has been reported that chronic treatment with insulin upregulates T-type channel membrane expression, leading to an increase in current density in clonal pituitary GH3 cells. Though this regulatory action may result from alterations in gene expression, recent studies have demonstrated also that endosomal trafficking provides a mechanism for dynamic changes in CaV channel membrane density. Therefore, in the present work we sought to determine whether the actions of insulin on T-type channel functional expression are mediated by transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanisms. Using real-time RT-PCR and semi-quantitative western blot we found no changes after treatment in the transcript and protein levels of Cav3.1, the T-type channel isoform preferentially expressed in the GH3 cells. Consistent with this, transcriptional studies using a luciferase reporter assay suggested that insulin treatment does not affect the Cav3.1 promoter activity. In contrast, patch-clamp recordings on HEK-293 cells stably expressing Cav3.1 channels showed a significant increase in current density after treatment, suggesting that the effects of insulin may require post-transcriptional regulation. In line with this, disruption of the endosomal recycling pathway using Brefeldin A and a dominant negative mutant of the small GTPase Rab11a prevented the stimulatory effects of insulin on Cav3.1 channels in HEK-293 cells. These results may help explain the effects of insulin on T-type channels and contribute to our understanding of how endosomal recycling impacts the functional expression of CaV channels.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a major Ca2+ influx pathway in most non-excitable cell types and Orai1 was recently identified as an essential pore-subunit of SOCE channels. Here we investigate the physiological role of Orai1 in bone homeostasis using Orai1-deficient mice (Orai1−/−). Orai1−/− mice developed osteopenia with decreased bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume. To identify the nature and origin of the bone defect, bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts from Orai1−/− mice were examined. Orai1-mediated SOCE was completely abolished in Orai1−/− osteoclast precursor cells and osteoclastogenesis in vitro from Orai1−/− mice was impaired due to a defect in cell fusion of pre-osteoclasts. Also, resorption activity in vitro was comparable but the size of pits formed by Orai1−/− osteoclasts was smaller. We next assessed the role of Orai1 in osteoblast differentiation and function by using a pre-osteoblast cell line, as well as primary osteoblasts from wild-type and Orai1−/− mice. SOCE in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblastic cells was inactivated by lentiviral overexpression of a pore-dead Orai1 mutant. Lack of SOCE in MC3T3-E1 had no effect on alkaline phosphatase staining and expression but substantially inhibited mineralized nodule formation. Consistent with this finding, Orai1-mediated SOCE was markedly reduced in Orai1−/− osteoblast precursor cells and osteoblastogenesis in vitro from Orai1−/− stromal cells showed impaired mineral deposition but no change in differentiation. This indicates that Orai1 is involved in the function but not in the differentiation of osteoblasts. Together, these results suggest that Orai1 plays a critical role in bone homeostasis by regulating both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) regulate normal development and homeostasis and drive disease progression in many forms of cancer. Both proteins signal by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases and heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans on target cell surfaces. Basic residues comprising the primary HS binding sites on HGF and VEGF provide similar surface charge distributions without underlying structural similarity. Combining three acidic amino acid substitutions in these sites in the HGF isoform NK1 or the VEGF isoform VEGF165 transformed each into potent, selective competitive antagonists of their respective normal and oncogenic signaling pathways. Our findings illustrate the importance of HS in growth factor driven cancer progression and reveal an efficient strategy for therapeutic antagonist development.

Abstract: Summary
We describe the discovery of sno-lncRNAs, a class of nuclear-enriched intron-derived long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are processed on both ends by the snoRNA machinery. During exonucleolytic trimming, the sequences between the snoRNAs are not degraded, leading to the accumulation of lncRNAs flanked by snoRNA sequences but lacking 5′ caps and 3′ poly(A) tails. Such RNAs are widely expressed in cells and tissues and can be produced by either box C/D or box H/ACA snoRNAs. Importantly, the genomic region encoding one abundant class of sno-lncRNAs (15q11-q13) is specifically deleted in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The PWS region sno-lncRNAs do not colocalize with nucleoli or Cajal bodies, but rather accumulate near their sites of synthesis. These sno-lncRNAs associate strongly with Fox family splicing regulators and alter patterns of splicing. These results thus implicate a previously unannotated class of lncRNAs in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS.

Abstract: Summary
The monoubiquitylation of histone H2B plays an important role in gene expression by contributing to the regulation of transcription elongation and mRNA processing and export. We explored additional cellular functions of this histone modification by investigating its localization to intergenic regions. H2B ubiquitylation is present in chromatin around origins of DNA replication in budding yeast, and as DNA is replicated its levels are maintained on daughter strands by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase. In the absence of H2B ubiquitylation, the prereplication complex is formed and activated, but replication fork progression is slowed down and the replisome becomes unstable in the presence of hydroxyurea. H2B ubiquitylation promotes the assembly or stability of nucleosomes on newly replicated DNA, and this function is postulated to contribute to fork progression and replisome stability.

Abstract: In astrocytes, thrombin leads to cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevations modulating a variety of cytoprotective and cytotoxic responses. Astrocytes respond to thrombin stimulation with a biphasic Ca2+ increase generated by an interplay between ER-Ca2+ release and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). In many cell types, STIM1 and Orai1 have been demonstrated to be central components of SOCE. STIM1 senses the ER-Ca2+ depletion and binds Orai1 to activate Ca2+ influx. Here we used immunocytochemistry, overexpression and siRNA assays to investigate the role of STIM1 and Orai1 in the thrombin-induced Ca2+ response in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes. We found that STIM1 and Orai1 are endogenously expressed in cortical astrocytes and distribute accordingly with other mammalian cells. Importantly, native and overexpressed STIM1 reorganized in puncta under thrombin stimulation and this reorganization was reversible. In addition, the overexpression of STIM1 and Orai1 increased by twofold the Ca2+ influx evoked by thrombin, while knockdown of endogenous STIM1 and Orai1 significantly decreased this Ca2+ influx. These results indicate that STIM1 and Orai1 underlie an important fraction of the Ca2+ response that astrocytes exhibit in the presence of thrombin. Thrombin stimulation in astrocytes leads to ER-Ca2+ release which causes STIM1 reorganization allowing the activation of Orai1 and the subsequent Ca2+ influx.

Abstract: Sterols play crucial roles as membrane components and precursors of steroid hormones (e.g., brassinosteroids, BR). Within membranes, sterols regulate membrane permeability and fluidity by interacting with other lipids and proteins. Sterols are frequently enriched in detergentinsoluble membranes (DIMs), which organize molecules involved in specialized signaling processes, including auxin transporters. To be fully functional, the two methyl groups at the C-4 position of cycloartenol, a precursor of plant sterols, must be removed by bifunctional 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases/C-4 decarboxylases (3βHSD/D). To understand the role of 3βHSD/D in Arabidopsis development, we analyzed the phenotypes of knock-out mutants and overexpression lines of two 3βHSD/D genes (At1g47290 and At2g26260). Neither single nor double knock-out mutants displayed a noticeable phenotype; however, overexpression consistently resulted in plants with wrinkled leaves and short inflorescence internodes. Interestingly, the internode growth defects were opportunistic; even within a plant, some stems were more severely affected than others. Endogenous levels of BRs were not altered in the overexpression lines, suggesting that the growth defect is not primarily due to a flaw in BR biosynthesis. To determine if overexpression of the sterol biosynthetic genes affects the functions of membrane-localized auxin transporters, we subjected plants to the auxin efflux carrier inhibitor, 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). Whereas the gravity vectors of wild-type roots became randomly scattered in response to NPA treatment, those of the overexpression lines continued to grow in the direction of gravity. Overexpression of the two Arabidopsis 3βHSD/D genes thus appears to affect auxin transporter activity, possibly by altering sterol composition in the membranes.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria modulate rates of translation initiation and degradation of target mRNAs, which they recognize through base-pairing facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq. Recent evidence indicates that the ternary complex of Hfq, sRNA and mRNA guides endoribonuclease RNase E to initiate turnover of both the RNAs. We show that a sRNA not only guides RNase E to a defined site in a target RNA, but also allosterically activates the enzyme by presenting a monophosphate group at the 5′-end of the cognate-pairing “seed.” Moreover, in the absence of the target the 5′-monophosphate makes the sRNA seed region vulnerable to an attack by RNase E against which Hfq confers no protection. These results suggest that the chemical signature and pairing status of the sRNA seed region may help to both ‘proofread’ recognition and activate mRNA cleavage, as part of a dynamic process involving cooperation of RNA, Hfq and RNase E.

Abstract: Summary
To date, cross-species comparisons of genetic interactomes have been restricted to small or functionally related gene sets, limiting our ability to infer evolutionary trends. To facilitate a more comprehensive analysis, we constructed a genome-scale epistasis map (E-MAP) for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, providing phenotypic signatures for ∼60% of the nonessential genome. Using these signatures, we generated a catalog of 297 functional modules, and we assigned function to 144 previously uncharacterized genes, including mRNA splicing and DNA damage checkpoint factors. Comparison with an integrated genetic interactome from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a hierarchical model for the evolution of genetic interactions, with conservation highest within protein complexes, lower within biological processes, and lowest between distinct biological processes. Despite the large evolutionary distance and extensive rewiring of individual interactions, both networks retain conserved features and display similar levels of functional crosstalk between biological processes, suggesting general design principles of genetic interactomes.

Abstract: Summary
In T cells, the adaptor Bam32 is coupled to Erk activation downstream of the TCR by an unknown mechanism. We characterized in Jurkat cells and primary T lymphocytes a pathway dependent on Bam32-PLC-γ1-Pak1 complexes, in which Pak1 kinase activates Raf-1 and Mek-1, both upstream of Erk. In the Bam32-PLC-γ1-Pak1 complex, catalytically inactive PLC-γ1 is used as a scaffold linking Bam32 to Pak1. PLC-γ1(C-SH2) directly binds S141 of Bam32, preventing LAT-mediated activation of Ras by PLC-γ1. The Bam32-PLC-γ1 interaction enhances the binding of the SH3 domain of the phospholipase with Pak1. The PLC-γ1(SH3)-Pak1 interaction activates Pak1 independently of the small GTPases Rac1/Cdc42, previously described as being the only activators of Pak1 in T cells. Direct binding of the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 to Pak1 dissociates inactive Pak1 homodimers, a mechanism required for Pak1 activation. We have thus uncovered a LAT/Ras-independent, Bam32-nucleated pathway that activates Erk signaling in T cells.

Abstract: Summary
A large proportion of colorectal cancers (CRCs) display mutational inactivation of the TGF-β pathway, yet, paradoxically, they are characterized by elevated TGF-β production. Here, we unveil a prometastatic program induced by TGF-β in the microenvironment that associates with a high risk of CRC relapse upon treatment. The activity of TGF-β on stromal cells increases the efficiency of organ colonization by CRC cells, whereas mice treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of TGFBR1 are resilient to metastasis formation. Secretion of IL11 by TGF-β-stimulated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) triggers GP130/STAT3 signaling in tumor cells. This crosstalk confers a survival advantage to metastatic cells. The dependency on the TGF-β stromal program for metastasis initiation could be exploited to improve the diagnosis and treatment of CRC.

During angiogenesis, nascent vascular sprouts fuse to form vascular networks, enabling efficient circulation. Mechanisms that stabilize the vascular plexus are not well understood. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a blood-borne lipid mediator implicated in the regulation of vascular and immune systems. Here we describe a mechanism by which the G protein-coupled S1P receptor-1 (S1P1) stabilizes the primary vascular network. A gradient of S1P1 expression from the mature regions of the vascular network to the growing vascular front was observed. In the absence of endothelial S1P1, adherens junctions are destabilized, barrier function is breached, and flow is perturbed, resulting in abnormal vascular hypersprouting. Interestingly, S1P1 responds to S1P as well as laminar shear stress to transduce flow-mediated signaling in endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate that blood flow and circulating S1P activate endothelial S1P1 to stabilize blood vessels in development and homeostasis.

The Size of the Proteasomal Substrate Determines Whether Its Degradation Will Be Mediated by Mono- or Polyubiquitylation,

Abstract: Summary
A polyubiquitin chain anchored to the substrate has been the hallmark of proteasomal recognition. However, the degradation signal appears to be more complex and to contain also a substrate’s unstructured region. Recent reports have shown that the proteasome can degrade also monoubiquitylated proteins, which adds an additional layer of complexity to the signal. Here, we demonstrate that the size of the substrate is an important determinant in its extent of ubiquitylation: a single ubiquitin moiety fused to a tail of up to ∼150 residues derived from either short artificial repeats or from naturally occurring proteins, is sufficient to target them for proteasomal degradation. Importantly, chemically synthesized adducts, where ubiquitin is attached to the substrate via a naturally occurring isopeptide bond, display similar characteristics. Taken together, these findings suggest that the ubiquitin proteasomal signal is adaptive, and is not always made of a long polyubiquitin chain.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin stimulates glucose uptake through the membrane translocation of GLUT4 and GLUT1. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) enhances insulin sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates GLUT4 and GLUT1 translocation, and glucose uptake, by activating the signaling pathway involving nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a calcium mobilizer, in adipocytes. We also demonstrate that PPARγ mediates insulin sensitization by enhancing NAADP production through upregulation of CD38, the only enzyme identified for NAADP synthesis. Insulin produced NAADP by both CD38-dependent and -independent pathways, whereas PPARγ produced NAADP by CD38-dependent pathway. Blocking the NAADP signaling pathway abrogated both insulin-stimulated and PPARγ-induced GLUT4 and GLUT1 translocation, thereby inhibiting glucose uptake. CD38 knockout partially inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, CD38 knockout completely blocked PPARγ-induced glucose uptake in adipocytes and PPARγ-mediated amelioration of glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. These results demonstrated that the NAADP signaling pathway is a critical molecular target for PPARγ-mediated insulin sensitization.

Abstract: Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), also termed P23 in human, belongs to a family of calcium- and tubulin-binding proteins, and it is generally regarded as a growth-regulating protein. Recently, Arabidopsis TCTP (AtTCTP) has been reported to function as an important growth regulator in plants. On the other hand, plant TCTP has been suggested to be involved in abiotic stress signaling such as aluminum, salt, and water deficit by a number of microarray or proteomic analyses. In this study, the biological functions of AtTCTP were investigated by using transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtTCTP. Interestingly, AtTCTP overexpression enhanced drought tolerance in plants. The expression analysis showed that AtTCTP was expressed in guard cells as well as in actively growing tissues. Physiological studies of the overexpression lines showed increased ABA- and calcium-induced stomatal closure ratios and faster stomatal closing responses to ABA. Furthermore, in vitro protein-protein interaction analysis confirmed the interaction between AtTCTP and microtubules, and microtubule cosedimentation assays revealed that the microtubule binding of AtTCTP increased after calcium treatment. These results demonstrate that the overexpression of AtTCTP confers drought tolerance to plants by rapid ABA-mediated stomatal closure via the interaction with microtubules in which calcium binding enhances the interaction. Collectively, the present results suggest that the plant TCTP has molecular properties similar to animal TCTPs, such as tubulin- and calcium-binding, and that it functions in ABA-mediated stomatal movement, in addition to regulating the growth of plants.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue is attracting much attention due to its antiobestic effects; however, its development and involvement in metabolic improvement remain elusive. Here we established a method for a high-efficiency (>90%) differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into functional classical brown adipocytes (BAs) using specific hemopoietin cocktail (HC) without exogenous gene transfer. BAs were not generated without HC, and lack of a component of HC induced white adipocyte (WA) marker expressions. hPSC-derived BA (hPSCdBA) showed respiratory and thermogenic activation by β-adrenergic receptor (AdrRβ) stimuli and augmented lipid and glucose tolerance, whereas human multipotent stromal cell-derived WA (hMSCdWA) improved lipid but inhibited glucose metabolism. Cotransplantation of hPSCdBA normalized hMSCdWA-induced glucose intolerance. Surprisingly, hPSCdBAs expressed various hemopoietin genes, serving as stroma for myeloid progenitors. Moreover, AdrRβ stimuli enhanced recovery from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Our study enhances our understanding of BA, identifying roles in metabolic and hemogenic regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of epithelial organization is a hallmark of carcinomas, but whether polarity regulates tumor growth and metastasis is poorly understood. To address this issue, we depleted the Par3 polarity gene by RNAi in combination with oncogenic Notch or Ras61L expression in the murine mammary gland. Par3 silencing dramatically reduced tumor latency in both models and produced invasive and metastatic tumors that retained epithelial marker expression. Par3 depletion was associated with induction of MMP9, destruction of the extracellular matrix, and invasion, all mediated by atypical PKC-dependant JAK/Stat3 activation. Importantly, Par3 expression is significantly reduced in human breast cancers, which correlates with active aPKC and Stat3. These data identify Par3 as a regulator of signaling pathways relevant to invasive breast cancer.

Abstract: In all species, fertilization triggers in the egg a rapid and transient increase of intracellular free calcium (Cai), but how this signal is generated following sperm and egg interaction has not been clearly characterised yet. In sea urchin, a signalling pathway involving tyrosine kinase and PLCγ has been proposed to be at the origin of the fertilization Cai signal. We report here that injection of src homology-2 (SH2) domains of the sea urchin PLCγ inhibits in a competitive manner the endogenous PLCγ, alters both the amplitude and duration of the fertilization Cai wave, but does not abrogate it. Our results suggest that PLCγ acts in conjunction with a cADPr pathway and G-proteins of the Gαq type to trigger the fertilization Cai wave, and reinforce a crucial role for PLCγ at mitosis and cytokinesis.

Abstract: Summary
Proteins with annealing activity are newly identified ATP-dependent motors that can rewind RPA-coated complementary single-stranded DNA bubbles. AH2 (annealing helicase 2, also named as ZRANB3) is the second protein with annealing activity, the function of which is still unknown. Here, we report that AH2 is recruited to stalled replication forks and that cells depleted of AH2 are hypersensitive to replication stresses. Furthermore, AH2 binds to PCNA, which is crucial for its function at stalled replication forks. Interestingly, we identified a HARP-like (HPL) domain in AH2 that is indispensible for its annealing activity in vitro and its function in vivo. Moreover, searching of HPL domain in SNF2 family of proteins led to the identification of SMARCA1 and RAD54L, both of which possess annealing activity. Thus, this study not only demonstrates the in vivo functions of AH2, but also reveals a common feature of this new subfamily of proteins with annealing activity.

Abstract: Summary
RNA structural transitions are important in the function and regulation of RNAs. Here, we reveal a layer of transcriptome organization in the form of RNA folding energies. By probing yeast RNA structures at different temperatures, we obtained relative melting temperatures (Tm) for RNA structures in over 4000 transcripts. Specific signatures of RNA Tm demarcated the polarity of mRNA open reading frames and highlighted numerous candidate regulatory RNA motifs in 3′ untranslated regions. RNA Tm distinguished noncoding versus coding RNAs and identified mRNAs with distinct cellular functions. We identified thousands of putative RNA thermometers, and their presence is predictive of the pattern of RNA decay in vivo during heat shock. The exosome complex recognizes unpaired bases during heat shock to degrade these RNAs, coupling intrinsic structural stabilities to gene regulation. Thus, genome-wide structural dynamics of RNA can parse functional elements of the transcriptome and reveal diverse biological insights.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria-originating reactive oxygen species (ROS) control T cell receptor (TCR)-induced gene expression. Here, we show that TCR-triggered activation of ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK), an alternative, glycolytic enzyme typical for Archaea, mediates generation of the oxidative signal. We also show that ADPGK is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and suggest that its active site protrudes toward the cytosol. The ADPGK-driven increase in glycolytic metabolism coincides with TCR-induced glucose uptake, downregulation of mitochondrial respiration, and deviation of glycolysis toward mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) shuttle; i.e., a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis similar to the Warburg effect. The activation of respiratory-chain-associated GPD2 results in hyperreduction of ubiquinone and ROS release from mitochondria. In parallel, mitochondrial bioenergetics and ultrastructure are altered. Downregulation of ADPGK or GPD2 abundance inhibits oxidative signal generation and induction of NF-κB-dependent gene expression, whereas overexpression of ADPGK potentiates them.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced activation of Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) plays crucial roles in oxidative stress-mediated cell death through the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. However, the regulatory mechanism of ASK1 in the oxidative stress response remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified the kelch repeat protein, Slim, as an activator of ASK1 through a Drosophila misexpression screen. We also performed a proteomics screen and revealed that Kelch domain containing 10 (KLHDC10), a mammalian ortholog of Slim, interacted with Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), which has been shown to inactivate ASK1 in response to ROS. KLHDC10 bound to the phosphatase domain of PP5 and suppressed its phosphatase activity. Moreover, KLHDC10 was required for H2O2-induced sustained activation of ASK1 and cell death in Neuro2A cells. These findings suggest that Slim/KLHDC10 is an activator of ASK1, contributing to oxidative stress-induced cell death through the suppression of PP5.

Abstract: Summary
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the putative RNA-helicase SDE3 assists posttranscriptional-gene-silencing (PTGS) amplification by RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase-6 (RDR6). SDE3 homologs in Drosophila, worm and human contribute to silence viruses, transposons or recently duplicated genes but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SDE3 is present with the PTGS effectors AGO1 and AGO2 in higher-order protein complexes owing to a specialized GW-repeat-containing C-terminal domain. We uncover an essential contribution of the RNA-helicase activity and a facilitating role for AGO binding in SDE3 action, which occurs downstream of RDR6. We show that these biochemical properties underpin dual roles for SDE3 in antiviral defense and, unexpectedly, in transposon silencing via a hitherto unanticipated pathway that correlates with DNA methylation, suggesting a continuum of action between PTGS and chromatin-level silencing. We identified endogenous SDE3 targets corresponding to nonconserved intergenic regions, transposons and recently evolved pseudogenes, unraveling striking functional convergences among plant and metazoan SDE3 pathways.

Abstract: Summary
How inflammation causes cancer is unclear. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine elevated in human large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. Mice overexpressing IL-15 develop LGL leukemia. Here, we show that prolonged in vitro exposure of wild-type (WT) LGL to IL-15 results in Myc-mediated upregulation of aurora kinases, centrosome aberrancies, and aneuploidy. Simultaneously, IL-15 represses miR-29b via induction of Myc/NF-κBp65/Hdac-1, resulting in Dnmt3b overexpression and DNA hypermethylation. All this is validated in human LGL leukemia. Adoptive transfer of WT LGL cultured with IL-15 led to malignant transformation in vivo. Drug targeting that reverses miR-29b repression cures otherwise fatal LGL leukemia. We show how excessive IL-15 initiates cancer and demonstrate effective drug targeting for potential therapy of human LGL leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
BAR domains can prevent membrane fission through their ability to shield necks of budding vesicles from fission-inducing factors. However, the physiological role of this inhibitory function and its regulation is unknown. Here we identify a checkpoint involving the BAR-domain-containing protein Arfaptin-1 that controls biogenesis of secretory granules at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). We demonstrate that protein kinase D (PKD) phosphorylates Arfaptin-1 at serine 132, which disrupts the ability of Arfaptin-1 to inhibit the activity of ADP ribosylation factor, an important component of the vesicle scission machinery. The physiological significance of this regulatory mechanism is evidenced by loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion due to granule scission defects in pancreatic β cells expressing nonphosphorylatable Arfaptin-1. Accordingly, depletion of Arfaptin-1 leads to the generation of small nonfunctional secretory granules. Hence, PKD-mediated Arfaptin-1 phosphorylation is necessary to ensure biogenesis of functional transport carriers at the TGN in regulated secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic actin cytoskeletal reorganization is integral to cell motility. Profilins are well-characterized regulators of actin polymerization; however, functional differences among coexpressed profilin isoforms are not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that profilin-1 and profilin-2 differentially regulate membrane protrusion, motility, and invasion; these processes are promoted by profilin-1 and suppressed by profilin-2. Compared to profilin-1, profilin-2 preferentially drives actin polymerization by the Ena/VASP protein, EVL. Profilin-2 and EVL suppress protrusive activity and cell motility by an actomyosin contractility-dependent mechanism. Importantly, EVL or profilin-2 downregulation enhances invasion in vitro and in vivo. In human breast cancer, lower EVL expression correlates with high invasiveness and poor patient outcome. We propose that profilin-2/EVL-mediated actin polymerization enhances actin bundling and suppresses breast cancer cell invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Human cancers with a subtetraploid karyotype are thought to originate from tetraploid precursors, but the cause of tetraploidization is unknown. We previously documented endoreduplication in mouse cells with persistent telomere dysfunction or genome-wide DNA damage. We now report that endoreduplication and mitotic failure occur during telomere crisis in human fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells and document the role of p53 and Rb in repressing tetraploidization. Using an inducible system to generate transient telomere damage, we show that telomere-driven tetraploidization enhances the tumorigenic transformation of mouse cells. Similar to human solid cancers, the resulting tumors evolved subtetraploid karyotypes. These data establish that telomere-driven tetraploidization is induced by critically short telomeres and has the potential to promote tumorigenesis in early cancerous lesions.

Abstract: Summary
Most adult mammalian tissues are quiescent, with rare cell divisions serving to maintain homeostasis. At present, the isolation and study of replicating cells from their in vivo niche typically involves immunostaining for intracellular markers of proliferation, causing the loss of sensitive biological material. We describe a transgenic mouse strain, expressing a CyclinB1-GFP fusion reporter, that marks replicating cells in the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Using flow cytometry, we isolate live replicating cells from the liver and compare their transcriptome to that of quiescent cells to reveal gene expression programs associated with cell proliferation in vivo. We find that replicating hepatocytes have reduced expression of genes characteristic of liver differentiation. This reporter system provides a powerful platform for gene expression and metabolic and functional studies of replicating cells in their in vivo niche.

Abstract: Summary
Activating mutations in NOTCH1, an essential regulator of T cell development, are frequently found in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Despite important advances in our understanding of Notch signal transduction, the regulation of Notch functions in the nucleus remains unclear. Using immunoaffinity purification, we identified NOTCH1 nuclear partners in T-ALL cells and showed that, beyond the well-characterized core activation complex (ICN1-CSL-MAML1), NOTCH1 assembles a multifunctional complex containing the transcription coactivator AF4p12, the PBAF nucleosome remodeling complex, and the histone demethylases LSD1 and PHF8 acting through their demethylase activity to promote epigenetic modifications at Notch-target genes. Remarkably, LSD1 functions as a corepressor when associated with CSL-repressor complex and as a NOTCH1 coactivator upon Notch activation. Our work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern Notch transcriptional activity and represents glimpse into NOTCH1 interaction landscape, which will help in deciphering mechanisms of NOTCH1 functions and regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent somatic ASXL1 mutations occur in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and acute myeloid leukemia, and are associated with adverse outcome. Despite the genetic and clinical data implicating ASXL1 mutations in myeloid malignancies, the mechanisms of transformation by ASXL1 mutations are not understood. Here, we identify that ASXL1 mutations result in loss of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) tri-methylation. Through integration of microarray data with genome-wide histone modification ChIP-Seq data, we identify targets of ASXL1 repression, including the posterior HOXA cluster that is known to contribute to myeloid transformation. We demonstrate that ASXL1 associates with the PRC2, and that loss of ASXL1 in vivo collaborates with NRASG12D to promote myeloid leukemogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular resolution three-dimensional (3D) visualization of defined, fluorescently labeled long-range neuronal networks in the uncut adult mouse brain has been elusive. Here, a virus-based strategy is described that allowed fluorescent labeling of centrifugally projecting neuronal populations in the ventral forebrain and their directly, monosynaptically connected bulbar interneurons upon a single stereotaxic injection into select neuronal populations. Implementation of improved tissue clearing combined with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy permitted imaging of the resulting connectivity maps in a single whole-brain scan. Subsequent 3D reconstructions revealed the exact distribution of the diverse neuronal ensembles monosynaptically connected with distinct bulbar interneuron populations. Moreover, rehydratation of brains after light-sheet fluorescence imaging enabled the immunohistochemical identification of synaptically connected neurons. Thus, this study describes a method for identifying monosynaptic connectivity maps from distinct, virally labeled neuronal populations that helps in better understanding of information flow in neural systems.

Abstract: Stainless steel (SS) is one of the most applicable materials in fabrication of cardiac implants. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of atomic structure of polycrystalline stainless steel on the response of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Samples are prepared from differently processed extruded rod and rolled sheet of 316L SS having different crystallographic structure. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated (200) and (111) orientations with distinct volume fractions in the specimens. Morphology and ADSCs behavior including adhesion, proliferation and differentiation are assessed. The expression of cardiac specific protein (cardiac troponin I) and genes of differentiating cardiomyocytes is analyzed by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. The number of attached and grown cells on the rod sample is higher than the sheet sample also the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of ADSCs grown on the samples demonstrates higher cell density and spreading pattern on the surface of rod sample. In differentiated ADSCs on the rod sample the expression of all genes except ANF are detectable, while on the sheet sample only the MEF2C and β-MHC are expressed. This study shows that the cellular response is influenced by the crystal structure of the substrate therefore; the skill to alter the structure of substrate may lend itself to engineer a biomaterial which could be suitable for differentiation of stem cells into a definite lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Protein mistranslation causes growth arrest in bacteria, mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast, and neurodegeneration in mammals. It remains poorly understood how mistranslated proteins cause such cellular defects. Here we demonstrate that streptomycin, a bactericidal aminoglycoside that increases ribosomal mistranslation, induces transient protein aggregation in wild-type Escherichia coli. We further determined the aggregated proteome using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. To identify genes that reduce cellular mistranslation toxicity, we selected from an overexpression library protein products that increased resistance against streptomycin and kanamycin. The selected proteins were significantly enriched in members of the oxidation-reduction pathway. Overexpressing one of these proteins, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F (a protein defending bacteria against hydrogen peroxide), but not its inactive mutant suppressed aggregated protein formation upon streptomycin treatment and increased aminoglycoside resistance. This work provides in-depth analyses of an aggregated proteome caused by streptomycin and suggests that cellular defense against hydrogen peroxide lowers the toxicity of mistranslation.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis. However, proteasome dysregulation in chronic diseases is poorly understood. Through genome-wide cell-based screening using 5,500 cDNAs, a signaling pathway leading to NFκB activation was selected as an inhibitor of 26S proteasome. TNF-α increased S5b (HGNC symbol PSMD5; hereafter S5b/PSMD5) expression via NFκB, and the surplus S5b/PSMD5 directly inhibited 26S proteasome assembly and activity. Downregulation of S5b/PSMD5 abolished TNF-α-induced proteasome inhibition. TNF-α enhanced the interaction of S5b/PSMD5 with S7/PSMC2 in nonproteasome complexes, and interference of this interaction rescued TNF-α-induced proteasome inhibition. Transgenic mice expressing S5b/PSMD5 exhibited a reduced life span and premature onset of aging-related phenotypes, including reduced proteasome activity in their tissues. Conversely, S5b/PSMD5 deficiency in Drosophila melanogaster ameliorated the tau rough eye phenotype, enhanced proteasome activity, and extended the life span of tau flies. These results reveal the critical role of S5b/PSMD5 in negative regulation of proteasome by TNF-α/NFκB and provide insights into proteasome inhibition in human disease.

Abstract: Summary
The pentaspan membrane glycoprotein CD133 marks lineage-specific cancer progenitor cells and is associated with poor prognosis in a number of tumor types. Despite its utility as a cancer progenitor cell marker, CD133 protein regulation and molecular function remain poorly understood. We find that the deacetylase HDAC6 physically associates with CD133 to negatively regulate CD133 trafficking down the endosomal-lysosomal pathway for degradation. We further demonstrate that CD133, HDAC6, and the central molecule of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin, can physically associate as a ternary complex. This association stabilizes β-catenin via HDAC6 deacetylase activity, which leads to activation of β-catenin signaling targets. Downregulation of either CD133 or HDAC6 results in increased β-catenin acetylation and degradation, which correlates with decreased proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Given that CD133 marks progenitor cells in a wide range of cancers, targeting CD133 may be a means to treat multiple cancer types.

Abstract: Older women exhibit blunted skeletal muscle hypertrophy following resistance training (RT) compared to other age and gender cohorts that is partially due to an impaired regenerative capacity. In the present study, we examined whether β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) provision to aged female rodents would enhance regenerative mechanisms and facilitate RT-induced myofiber growth. Nineteen-month old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: HMB (0.48 g/kg/d; n = 6), non-HMB (n = 6), and control (n = 4). HMB and non-HMB groups underwent RT every third day for 10 weeks using a ladder climbing apparatus. Whole body strength, grip strength, and body composition was evaluated before and after RT. The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were analyzed using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry to determine myofiber dimensions, transcript expression, and satellite cells/myonuclei, respectively. ANOVAs were used with significance set at p < 0.05. There were significant time effects (pre vs. post) for whole body strength (+262%), grip strength (+17%), lean mass (+20%), and fat mass (-19%). Both RT groups exhibited significant increases in the mean myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in the gastrocnemius and soleus (+8-22%) compared to control. Moreover, both groups demonstrated significant increases in the numbers of satellite cells (+100-108%) and myonuclei (+32%) in the soleus but not the gastrocnemius. A significant IGF-I mRNA elevation was only observed in soleus of the HMB group (+33%) whereas MGF and myogenin increased significantly in both groups (+32-40%). Our findings suggest that HMB did not further enhance intense RT-mediated myogenic mechanisms and myofiber CSA in aged female rats.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation, is repressed in certain cell types in hypoxia. However, hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α) can act as a proliferation-promoting factor in some biological settings. This paradoxical situation led us to study whether HIF2α has a specific effect on mTORC1 regulation. Here we show that activation of the HIF2α pathway increases mTORC1 activity by upregulating expression of the amino acid carrier SLC7A5. At the molecular level we also show that HIF2α binds to the Slc7a5 proximal promoter. Our findings identify a link between the oxygen-sensing HIF2α pathway and mTORC1 regulation, revealing the molecular basis of the tumor-promoting properties of HIF2α in von Hippel-Lindau-deficient cells. We also describe relevant physiological scenarios, including those that occur in liver and lung tissue, wherein HIF2α or low-oxygen tension drive mTORC1 activity and SLC7A5 expression.

Abstract: In fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the spnab2 gene encodes an ortholog of the budding yeast nuclear abundant poly(A)+ RNA-binding protein 2 (Nab2) that is an essential protein required for both mRNA biogenesis and nuclear export of mRNA to the cytoplasm. We have previously isolated three mutants (SLnab1-3) that showed synthetic lethality under the repressed condition of spnab2 expression. In this study, we isolated a novel rmn1 gene as a multicopy suppressor that complemented the defects in growth and mRNA export of SLnab1 mutant cells. The rmn1 gene contained three introns and encoded a 589 amino-acid protein with the RNA recognition motif (RRM) in the central region. The Δrmn1 null mutant was viable but showed a slight mRNA export defect. However, its overexpression caused a deleterious effect on growth accompanied by intense accumulation of poly(A)+RNA in the nucleus. The combination of Δrmn1 with Δspnab2 or Δspmex67 also inhibited growth. In addition, Rmn1p was associated with Rae1p in vivo. These results suggest that rmn1 is a novel gene that is functionally linked to spnab2.

Abstract: Summary
Integrin recycling is critical for cell migration. Protein kinase D (PKD) mediates signals from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) to control αvβ3 integrin recycling. We now show that Rabaptin-5, a Rab5 effector in endosomal membrane fusion, is a PKD substrate. PKD phosphorylates Rabaptin-5 at Ser407, and this is both necessary and sufficient for PDGF-dependent short-loop recycling of αvβ3, which in turn inhibits α5β1 integrin recycling. Rab4, but not Rab5, interacts with phosphorylated Rabaptin-5 toward the front of migrating cells to promote delivery of αvβ3 to the leading edge, thereby driving persistent cell motility and invasion that is dependent on this integrin. Consistently, disruption of Rabaptin-5 Ser407 phosphorylation reduces persistent cell migration in 2D and αvβ3-dependent invasion. Conversely, invasive migration that is dependent on α5β1 integrin is promoted by disrupting Rabaptin phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that the PKD pathway couples receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to an integrin switch via Rabaptin-5 phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Increased expression of the chemokine CCL2 in tumor cells correlates with enhanced metastasis, poor prognosis, and recruitment of CCR2+Ly6Chi monocytes. However, the mechanisms driving tumor cell extravasation through the endothelium remain elusive. Here, we describe CCL2 upregulation in metastatic UICC stage IV colon carcinomas and demonstrate that tumor cell-derived CCL2 activates the CCR2+ endothelium to increase vascular permeability in vivo. CCR2 deficiency prevents colon carcinoma extravasation and metastasis. Of note, CCR2 expression on radio-resistant cells or endothelial CCR2 expression restores extravasation and metastasis in Ccr2−/− mice. Reduction of CCR2 expression on myeloid cells decreases but does not prevent metastasis. CCL2-induced vascular permeability and metastasis is dependent on JAK2-Stat5 and p38MAPK signaling. Our study identifies potential targets for treating CCL2-dependent metastasis.

Diffusion into human islets is limited to molecules below 10kDa,

Abstract: Isolated islets are important tools in diabetes research and are used for islet transplantation as a treatment for type 1 diabetes. Yet these cell clusters have a dramatic diffusion barrier that leads to core cell death. Computer modeling has provided theoretical size limitations, but little has been done to measure the actual rate of diffusion in islets. The purpose of this study was to directly measure the diffusion barrier in intact human islets and determine its role in restricting insulin secretion. Impeded diffusion into islets was monitored with fluorescent dextran beads. Dextran beads of 10–70kDa failed to diffuse into the core of the intact islets, while 0.9kDa probe was observed within the core of smaller islets. Diffusion of the fluorescent form of glucose, 2-NBDG, had similar diffusion limitations as the beads, with an average intra-islet diffusion rate of 1.5±0.2μm/min. The poor diffusion properties were associated with core cell death from necrosis, not apoptosis. Short-term exposure to a mild papain/0 Ca2+ cocktail, dramatically reduced the diffusion barrier so that all cells within islets were exposed to media components. Lowering the diffusion barrier increased the immediate and long-term viability of islet cells, and tended to increase the amount of insulin released, especially in low glucose conditions. However, it failed to improve the large islet's glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Thus, the islet diffusion barrier leads to low viability and poor survival of large islets, but is not solely responsible for the reduced insulin secretion of large isolated islets.
