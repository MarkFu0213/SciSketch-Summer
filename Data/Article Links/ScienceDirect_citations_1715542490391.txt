Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium vivax infects hepatocytes to form schizonts that cause blood infection, or dormant hypnozoites that can persist for months in the liver before leading to relapsing blood infections. The molecular processes that drive P. vivax schizont and hypnozoite survival remain largely unknown, but they likely involve a rich network of host-pathogen interactions, including those occurring at the host-parasite interface, the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM). Using a recently developed P. vivax liver-stage model system we demonstrate that host aquaporin-3 (AQP3) localizes to the PVM of schizonts and hypnozoites within 5 days after invasion. This recruitment is also observed in P. vivax-infected reticulocytes. Chemical treatment with the AQP3 inhibitor auphen reduces P. vivax liver hypnozoite and schizont burden, and inhibits P. vivax asexual blood-stage growth. These findings reveal a role for AQP3 in P. vivax liver and blood stages and suggest that the protein may be targeted for therapeutic treatment.

Abstract: The primary cilium acts as a sensory organelle with diverse receptors and ion channels to detect extracellular cues and regulate cellular functions, including cell migration. The migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to bone remodeling sites is important for bone homeostasis. Recently, we have suggested that osteopontin (OPN) is a significant chemoattractant in MSC migration to bone remodeling sites. The objective of this study was to determine whether the primary cilium acts as a chemoattractant sensory unit to detect OPN cues and control MSC migration. We found that the loss of primary cilium induced by silencing of IFT88 reduced OPN-induced migration of MSCs. The effect of IFT88 silencing on cellular attachment, spreading, and proliferation was negligible. The loss of primary cilium did not affect the level of integrinβ1 or CD44, two known receptors for OPN. Interestingly, CD44 was localized to the primary cilium by OPN stimulus. Knockdown of IFT88 or CD44 dysregulated OPN-induced signaling activation and abolished OPN-induced Cdc42 activation. Our findings suggest that the primary cilium acts as a chemoattractant sensor for OPN to regulate MSC migration by controlling not only CD44-mediated OPN signaling, but also Cdc42-mediated actin cytoskeleton rearrangement.

Abstract: Summary
Liver-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells remain in and constantly patrol the liver to elicit rapid immunity upon antigen encounter and can mediate efficient protection against liver-stage Plasmodium infection. This finding has prompted the development of immunization strategies where T cells are activated in the spleen and then trapped in the liver to form TRM cells. Here, we identify PbRPL6120-127, a H2-Kb-restricted epitope from the putative 60S ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) of Plasmodium berghei ANKA, as an optimal antigen for endogenous liver TRM cell generation and protection against malaria. A single dose vaccination targeting RPL6 provided effective and prolonged sterilizing immunity against high dose sporozoite challenges. Expressed throughout the parasite life cycle, across Plasmodium species, and highly conserved, RPL6 exhibits strong translation potential as a vaccine candidate. This is further advocated by the identification of a broadly conserved, immunogenic HLA-A∗02:01-restricted epitope in P. falciparum RPL6.

Abstract: Summary
Plants deploy a variety of secondary metabolites to fend off pathogen attack. Although defense compounds are generally considered toxic to microbes, the exact mechanisms are often unknown. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis defense compound sulforaphane (SFN) functions primarily by inhibiting Pseudomonas syringae type III secretion system (TTSS) genes, which are essential for pathogenesis. Plants lacking the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway, which do not accumulate SFN, were unable to attenuate TTSS gene expression and exhibited increased susceptibility to P. syringae strains that cannot detoxify SFN. Chemoproteomics analyses showed that SFN covalently modified the cysteine at position 209 of HrpS, a key transcription factor controlling TTSS gene expression. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analyses further confirmed that Cys209 was responsible for bacterial sensitivity to SFN in vitro and sensitivity to plant defenses conferred by the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway. Collectively, these results illustrate a previously unknown mechanism by which plants disarm a pathogenic bacterium.

Abstract: Fibroblast growth factor 21(FGF21) is an endocrine cytokine that targets inflammation and atherosclerosis (AS). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the FGF21 anti-AS effect remain to be explored. Pyroptosis induced by hyperlipidemia or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) is a significant step in the advancement of AS. This work aimed to evaluate the mechanisms and functioning of FGF21 against AS using an atherosclerotic animal model and oxLDL mimic in vitro. We found that exogenous treatments with FGF21 significantly reduced the aortic sinus plaque area and ameliorated dyslipidemia in apoE−/- mice. FGF21 attenuated the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins both in vivo and in vitro. Possibly, FGF21 improves mitochondrial function, inhibits mitochondrial division, and reduces ROS production by maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and function to reduce NLRP3 related pyroptosis and inhibits VECs endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby exerting an anti-atherosclerotic effect.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide analysis of the mode of action of GSK983, a potent antiviral agent, led to the identification of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase as its target along with the discovery that genetic knockdown of pyrimidine salvage sensitized cells to GSK983. Because GSK983 is an ineffective antiviral in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, we explored combining GSK983 with pyrimidine salvage inhibitors. We synthesized and evaluated analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil (CPU), an inhibitor of uridine salvage. We found that CPU was converted into its triphosphate in cells. When combined with GSK983, CPU resulted in large drops in cellular UTP and CTP pools. Consequently, CPU-GSK983 suppressed dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of uridine. In addition, the CPU-GSK983 combination markedly enhanced the effect of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibition on viral infection. Our findings highlight a new host-targeting strategy for potentiating the antiviral activity of RdRp inhibitors.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer cells shed from primary tumors can spread easily to the peritoneum via the peritoneal fluid. To allow further metastasis, the cancer cells must interact with the mesothelial cell layer, which covers the entire surface of the peritoneal organs. Although the clinical importance of this interaction between cancer and mesothelial cells has been increasingly recognized, the molecular mechanisms utilized by cancer cells to adhere to and migrate through the mesothelial cell layer are poorly understood. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of cancer cell trans-mesothelial migration, we set up an in vitro trans-mesothelial migration assay using primary peritoneal mesothelial cells. Using this method, we found that downregulation of filopodial protein fascin-1 or myosin X expression in ES-2 cells significantly inhibited the rate of trans-mesothelial migration of cancer cells, whereas upregulation of fascin-1 in SK-OV-3 cells enhanced this rate. Furthermore, downregulation of N-cadherin or integrin β1 inhibited the rate of cancer cell trans-mesothelial migration. Conversely, downregulation of cortactin or TKS5 or treatment with the MMP inhibitor GM6001 or the N-WASP inhibitor wiskostatin did not have any effect on cancer cell trans-mesothelial migration. These results suggest that filopodia, but not lamellipodia or invadopodia, play an important role in the trans-mesothelial migration of ovarian cancer cells.

Abstract: Re-epithelialization of the alveolar surface is a key process of lung alveolar epithelial barrier repair after acute lung injury. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) pathway plays key roles in lung homeostasis, and its involvement in wound repair has been already reported in human bronchial epithelial cells. However, its effects on lung alveolar epithelial repair after injury remain unknown. We investigated whether RAGE stimulation with its ligands high–mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) or advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), alone or associated with RAGE inhibition using RAGE antagonist peptide, affects in vitro wound healing in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. We further asked whether these effects could be associated with changes in cell proliferation and migration. We found that treatment of A549 cells with HMGB1 or AGEs promotes RAGE-dependent wound healing after a scratch assay. In addition, both RAGE ligands increased cell proliferation in a RAGE-dependent manner. Treatment with HMGB1 increased migration of alveolar epithelial cells at 12 h, independently of RAGE, whereas AGEs stimulated migration as measured 48 h after injury in a RAGE-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that RAGE pathway is involved in lung alveolar epithelial wound repair, possibly through enhanced cell migration and proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Camelid single-domain antibody fragments (nanobodies) offer the specificity of an antibody in a single 15-kDa immunoglobulin domain. Their small size allows for easy genetic manipulation of the nanobody sequence to incorporate protein tags, facilitating their use as biochemical probes. The nanobody VUN400, which recognizes the second extracellular loop of the human CXCR4 chemokine receptor, was used as a probe to monitor specific CXCR4 conformations. VUN400 was fused via its C terminus to the 11-amino-acid HiBiT tag (VUN400-HiBiT) which complements LgBiT protein, forming a full-length functional NanoLuc luciferase. Here, complemented luminescence was used to detect VUN400-HiBiT binding to CXCR4 receptors expressed in living HEK293 cells. VUN400-HiBiT binding to CXCR4 could be prevented by orthosteric and allosteric ligands, allowing VUN400-HiBiT to be used as a probe to detect allosteric interactions with CXCR4. These data demonstrate that the high specificity offered by extracellular targeted nanobodies can be utilized to probe receptor pharmacology.

Abstract: Surgical resection is the only curative treatment for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, approximately 33% of non-small cell lung cancer patients recur with the stage I disease, which may be attributed to a deficiency in antitumor immunity. In the present study, for early stage lung adenocarcinoma patients with early recurrence and early non-recurrence, we investigated the quantity of tumor-infiltrating T and B cells by immunohistochemistry, as well as the genes in the complementarity determining region 3 of the T-cell receptor β chain and the B-cell receptor immunoglobulin heavy chain. A decreased number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD20+) was present in early recurrence patients. A significant increase in oligoclones and a reduction in T-cell receptor diversity were observed in the early recurrence group. Furthermore, there was a preference for V, J gene, and VJ gene combinations in patients with early recurrence versus non-recurrence, suggesting that this may be a new biomarker for the recurrence of early stage lung adenocarcinoma. These data indicate that T and B cell receptor repertoires influence the depth of human adaptive immune responses, and in addition to the quantity of tumor infiltrating T and B cells, may contribute to the prevention of early stage lung adenocarcinoma recurrence after surgical resection. Our study illustrates the potential value of the immune repertoire for predicting clinical efficacy and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Lung fibrosis is a devastating disease characterized by fibroblast accumulation and extracellular matrix deposition in lungs. However, its molecular and cellular pathogenesis is not fully understood and the current therapeutic strategies are ineffective. Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is the most widely used experimental model for research aimed at in-depth analysis of lung fibrosis mechanisms. The present study aimed to analyse the effects of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which is associated with many diseases, in lung fibrosis. GDF15 mRNA expression was elevated in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice, revealed by comprehensive gene analysis. Its protein levels were also increased in the lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and plasma obtained from bleomycin-treated mice as compared to those in saline-treated mice. Bleomycin administration in mice resulted in a marked increase in senescence-associated β-galactosidase-positive and p16INK4a-positive lung structural cells including alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Immunohistochemical staining using anti-GDF15 antibody and increased mRNA expression of GDF15 in bleomycin-induced senescent A549 cells indicated that GDF15 is produced from alveolar epithelial cells undergoing bleomycin-induced cellular senescence. GDF15 was also implicated in the augmentation of interleukin-4/interleukin-13-induced mRNA expression of M2 markers including arginase 1 and chitinase-3-like protein and was also responsible for increased α-smooth muscle actin expression through the ALK5-Smad2/3 pathway in WI-38 lung fibroblasts. Therefore, GDF15 secreted from senescent alveolar epithelial cells might act as a profibrotic factor through activation of M2 macrophages and fibroblasts. This implies that GDF15 could be a potential therapeutic target and a predictor of lung fibrosis progression.

Abstract: AAV-delivered microdystrophin genes hold great promise for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treatment. It is anticipated that the optimization of engineered dystrophin genes will be required to increase the efficacy and reduce the immunogenicity of transgenic proteins. An in vitro system is required for the efficacy testing of genetically engineered dystrophin genes. We report here on the proof of concept for an in vitro assay based on the assessment of sarcolemma damage after repetitively applied electrical stimuli. The primary cell culture of myoblasts was established from wild-type C57BL/10ScSnJ and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The preparation parameters and the differentiation of contractile myotubes were optimized. DAPI and TO-PRO-3 dyes were used to assess myotubular membrane permeability in response to electrical pulse stimulation (EPS). Myotubes derived from mdx mice exhibited a greater increase in membrane damage, as assessed by TO-PRO-3-measured permeability after EPS, than was exhibited by the healthy control myotubes. AAV-DJ particles carrying the microdystrophin gene were used to transduce mdx-derived differentiated myotubes. Microdystrophin delivery ameliorated the disease phenotype and reduced the EPS-induced membrane damage to a level comparable to that of the healthy controls. Thus, the in vitro system was shown to be capable of supporting studies on DMD gene therapy.

Abstract: Endothelial cells play essential roles in angiogenesis. Heat shock protein A12B (HSPA12B), a novel member of the multigene Hsp70 family, expresses specifically in endothelial cells. Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) has been used for the treatment of human diabetic complications for more than 20 years. However, little is known whether LA impacts endothelial proliferation and migration. To address these questions, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and treated with LA. We found that LA reduced viable HUVECs but not caused LDH leakage and nuclear condensation, suggesting an inhibitory effect of LA on HUVEC proliferation. We also noticed that LA impeded wound closure of HUVEC monolayers. The expressions of C-Myc, VEGF, and eNOS and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase were reduced by LA. Moreover, LA decreased the expression of heat shock protein A12B (HSPA12B). Notably, overexpression of HSPA12B in endothelial cells prevented the LA-induced loss of VEGF. More importantly, HSPA12B overexpression attenuated the LA-induced inhibition of endothelial proliferation and migration. Collectively, the results demonstrated that LA inhibited proliferative and migratory abilities in human vascular endothelial cells through the downregulation of the HSPA12B/VEGF signaling axis. The data suggest that besides the treatment in diabetic complications, LA might represent a viable therapeutic potential for human diseases that involve high angiogenic activities such as cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The exotoxin TcsL is a major virulence factor in Paeniclostridium (Clostridium) sordellii and responsible for the high lethality rate associated with P. sordellii infection. Here, we present a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-mediated screen using a human lung carcinoma cell line and identify semaphorin (SEMA) 6A and 6B as receptors for TcsL. Disrupting SEMA6A/6B expression in several distinct human cell lines and primary human endothelial cells results in reduced TcsL sensitivity, while SEMA6A/6B over-expression increases their sensitivity. TcsL recognizes the extracellular domain (ECD) of SEMA6A/6B via a region homologous to the receptor-binding site in Clostridioides difficile toxin B (TcdB), which binds the human receptor Frizzled. Exchanging the receptor-binding interfaces between TcsL and TcdB switches their receptor-binding specificity. Finally, administration of SEMA6A-ECD proteins protects human cells from TcsL toxicity and reduces TcsL-induced damage to lung tissues and the lethality rate in mice. These findings establish SEMA6A and 6B as pathophysiologically relevant receptors for TcsL.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a key interferon effector that broadly prevents infection by diverse viruses. However, the cellular factors that control IFITM3 homeostasis and antiviral activity have not been fully elucidated. Using site-specific photo-crosslinking and quantitative proteomic analysis, here we present the identification and functional characterization of VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase as a primary interaction partner of IFITM3. We show that IFITM3 ubiquitination at lysine 24 is crucial for VCP binding, trafficking, turnover, and engagement with incoming virus particles. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of VCP/p97 ATPase activity leads to defective IFITM3 lysosomal sorting, turnover, and co-trafficking with virus particles. Our results showcase the utility of site-specific protein photo-crosslinking in mammalian cells and reveal VCP/p97 as a key cellular factor involved in IFITM3 trafficking and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
N-acyl amino acids are a family of cold-inducible circulating lipids that stimulate thermogenesis. Their biosynthesis is mediated by a secreted enzyme called PM20D1. The extracellular mechanisms that regulate PM20D1 or N-acyl amino acid activity in the complex environment of blood plasma remains unknown. Using quantitative proteomics, here we show that PM20D1 circulates in tight association with both low- and high-density lipoproteins. Lipoprotein particles are powerful co-activators of PM20D1 activity in vitro and N-acyl amino acid biosynthesis in vivo. We also identify serum albumin as a physiologic N-acyl amino acid carrier, which spatially segregates N-acyl amino acids away from their sites of production, confers resistance to hydrolytic degradation, and establishes an equilibrium between thermogenic “free” versus inactive “bound” fractions. These data establish lipoprotein particles as principal extracellular sites of N-acyl amino acid biosynthesis and identify a lipoprotein-albumin network that regulates the activity of a circulating thermogenic lipid family.

Abstract: Summary
Proper management of COVID-19 mandates better understanding of disease pathogenesis. The sudden clinical deterioration 7–8 days after initial symptom onset suggests that severe respiratory failure (SRF) in COVID-19 is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction. We studied immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of whom had SRF. All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza. SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes. Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.

Abstract: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an anti-cancer differentiation therapy agent effective for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) but not acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in general. Using the HL-60 human non-APL AML model where ATRA causes nuclear enrichment of c-Raf that drives differentiation and G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, we now observe that c-Raf in the nucleus showed novel interactions with several prominent regulators of the cell cycle and cell differentiation. One is cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). ATRA treatment caused c-Raf to dissociate from Cdk2. This was associated with enhanced binding of Cdk2 with retinoic acid receptor α (RARα). Consistent with this novel Raf/CDK2/RARα axis contributing to differentiation, CD38 expression per cell, which is transcriptionally regulated by a retinoic acid response element (RARE), is enhanced. The RB tumor suppressor, a fundamental regulator of G1 cell cycle progression or arrest, was also targeted by c-Raf in the nucleus. RB and specifically the S608 phosphorylated form (pS608RB) complexed with c-Raf. ATRA treatment induced S608RB-hypophosphorylation associated with G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and release of c-Raf from RB. We also found that nuclear c-Raf interacted with SMARCD1, a pioneering component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. ATRA treatment diminished the amount of this protein bound to c-Raf. The data suggest that ATRA treatment to HL-60 human cells re-directed c-Raf from its historically pro-proliferation functions in the cytoplasm to pro-differentiation functions in the nucleus.

Abstract: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the urinary system, whose molecular mechanism is still not clear. ALPK2 is a member of alpha protein kinase family, and its relationship with RCC is never reported. In this study, expression of ALPK2 in tumor tissues or cells of RCC was detected by qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. The effects of ALPK2 knockdown on cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration and apoptosis were assessed by MTT, colony formation assay, wound-healing assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The influence of ALPK2 knockdown on tumor growth in vivo was evaluated by mice xenograft models. The results demonstrated that ALPK2 was upregulated in tumor tissues of RCC and its high expression was significantly associated with advanced stage and poor prognosis. Knockdown of ALPK2 could inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and cell migration of RCC cells, while promoting cell apoptosis. The suppression of tumor growth in vivo by ALPK2 knockdown was also showed by using mice xenograft models. Moreover, the regulation of RCC by ALPK2 may involve Akt, CDK6, Cyclin D1 and PIK3CA signaling. Therefore, our studies suggested that ALPK2 may act as a tumor promotor in the development and progression of RCC, and could be considered as a novel therapeutic target for RCC treatment.

Abstract: LAMC2, as a unique chain in the Laminin 5 molecule, has been found to be associated with malignant metastases in some cancers. However, the roles and mechanisms by which LAMC2 affects the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells remain unclear. First, we found that laminin 5/LAMC2 and its receptors were highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Then, we investigated the effects of LAMC2 on pancreatic cancer cell migration/invasion and extracellular (pHe). We also demonstrated that LAMC2 phosphorylated Akt-Ser473 to promote the expression, activity and cell membrane accumulation of NHE1 within pancreatic cancer cells. So we speculated that LAMC2 modulated the pHe to promote migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, our data also showed that LAMC2/NHE1 resulted in altered cell morphology and aberrant expression of mesenchymal markers. The function of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) were affected by LAMC2/NHE1 signaling. LAMC2/NHE1 signaling generated extracellular acidification to induce dynamic actin-dependent pseudopodial formation and EMT programs that promote tumor cell invasion in pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, we found that LAMC2 was responsible for generating the extracellular acidic conditions that mediated invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by activating Akt/NHE1 signaling. LAMC2 is a characteristic prognostic and therapeutic agent of PDCA.

Abstract: Summary
α-Synuclein (α-syn) overload is strongly associated with Parkinson disease (PD), and reduction of the α-syn level by targeting the peptide-based system through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is a promising strategy to delay PD progression. However, if the ALP is comprised, targeting the peptide-based proteasomal degradation system would be a good alternative. In this study, we designed a fusion peptide containing an α-syn-binding domain and a short strong proteasome-targeting motif. Our results reveal that this peptide could specifically bind to α-syn, and direct it to the proteasomes for degradation in a recombinant expression system. Furthermore, by adding a membrane-penetrating motif to this fusion peptide, we demonstrated that it could penetrate into cells and consequently suppress the cellular α-syn level through proteasome degradation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Functionally, these effects rescued the mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular defects caused by α-syn overexpression in the cultured cells and primary neurons.

Abstract: Low estrogen levels may predispose women to increased bodyweight and dyslipidemia. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest an involvement of depressed heat shock response (HSR) in this scenario because estrogen potently stimulates HSR. As heat treatment induces the expression of the anti-inflammatory heat shock proteins of the 70-kDa family (HSP70) and its accompanying HSR, we aimed to investigate whether chronic heat treatment promotes beneficial effects on biometric, lipid profile, oxidative stress, and HSR in ovariectomized rats. Wistar adult female rats (n = 32) were divided into four groups: control (C, n = 7), ovariectomized (OVX, n = 9), heat-treated (HT, n = 9), and heat-treated ovariectomized rats (OVX+HT, n = 7). HT and OVX+HT rats were anesthetized and submitted to heat treatment (once a week for 12 weeks) in a water bath (41 °C) to increase rats’ rectal temperature up to 41°C for 15 min, while C and OVX animals were submitted to a 36°C water bath. HT attenuated the weight gain induced by OVX and increased HDL cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels. Also, OVX rats showed increased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels that were not influenced by HT. Interestingly, it was found that an overall trend for HT to decrease tissue catalase and superoxide dismutase antioxidant activities was paralleled by a decrease in malondialdehyde levels (indicative of lower lipoperoxidation), especially in the skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, OVX was not able to depress intracellular HSP70 expression in the skeletal muscle, as expected, and this remained unchanged with HT. However, chronic HT did enhance intracellular HSP70 contents in white adipose tissue of OVX animals. As both glucose and insulin tolerance tests were not affected by OVX, which was not modified by HT, we suppose that estrogen absence alone is not sufficient to determine a state of insulin resistance associated with low intramuscular HSP70 content.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes influence neuronal maturation and function by providing trophic support, regulating the extracellular environment, and modulating signaling at synapses. The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offers a human system with which to validate and re-evaluate insights from animal studies. Here, we set out to examine interactions between human astrocytes and neurons derived from a common cortical progenitor pool, thereby recapitulating aspects of in vivo cortical development. We show that the cortical iPSC-derived astrocytes exhibit many of the molecular and functional hallmarks of astrocytes. Furthermore, optogenetic and electrophysiological co-culture experiments reveal that the iPSC-astrocytes can actively modulate ongoing synaptic transmission and exert pro-maturational effects upon developing networks of iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Finally, transcriptomic analyses implicate synapse-associated extracellular signaling in the astrocytes' pro-maturational effects upon the iPSC-derived neurons. This work helps lay the foundation for future investigations into astrocyte-to-neuron interactions in human health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
GM1 gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disease caused by loss of lysosomal β-galactosidase activity and characterized by progressive neurodegeneration due to massive accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in the brain. Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with GM1 gangliosidosis, and the resultant neurons showed impaired neurotransmitter release as a presynaptic function and accumulation of GM1 ganglioside. Treatment of normal neurons with GM1 ganglioside also disturbed presynaptic function. A high-content drug-screening system was then established and identified two compounds as drug candidates for GM1 gangliosidosis. Treatment of the patient-derived neurons with the candidate agents activated autophagy pathways, reducing GM1 ganglioside accumulation in vitro and in vivo, and restoring the presynaptic dysfunction. Our findings thus demonstrated the potential value of patient-derived iPSC lines as cellular models of GM1 gangliosidosis and revealed two potential therapeutic agents for future clinical application.

Abstract: Summary
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an enteric bacterial disease that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. C. difficile capitalizes on gut inflammation and microbiome dysbiosis to establish infection, with symptoms ranging from watery diarrhea to toxic megacolon. We reported that the safe-in-human clinical drug ebselen (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03013400, NCT01452607, NCT00762671, and NCT02603081) has biochemical, cell-based, and in vivo efficacy against the toxins of C. difficile. Here, we show that ebselen treatment reduces recurrence rates and decreases colitis in a hamster model of relapsing CDI. Furthermore, ebselen treatment does not alter microbiome diversity and promotes recovery back to that of healthy controls after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in healthy and C. difficile-infected mice. This increased microbiome recovery upon ebselen treatment correlates with a decrease in host-derived inflammatory markers, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory properties of ebselen, combined with its anti-toxin function, help to mitigate the major clinical challenges of CDI, including recurrence, microbial dysbiosis, and colitis.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we identify the natural product gambogic acid as well as structurally related synthetic xanthones as first-in-class covalent inhibitors of the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. We apply chemoproteomics to determine that gambogic acid binds to the regulatory small subunit B of the serine palmitoyltransferase complex (SPTSSB). We then test structurally related synthetic xanthones to identify 18 as an equally potent but more selective binder of SPTSSB and show that 18 reduces sphingolipid levels in situ and in vivo. Finally, using various biological methods, we demonstrate that 18 induces cellular responses characteristic for diminished sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling. This study demonstrates that SPTSSB may become a viable therapeutic target in various diseases with pathological S1P signaling. Furthermore, we believe that our compound will become a valuable tool for studying the sphingolipid metabolism and serve as a blueprint for the development of a new generation of sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) belong to the family Filoviridae. MARV causes severe disease in humans with high fatality. We previously isolated a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from B cells of a human survivor with previous naturally acquired MARV infection. Here, we characterized functional properties of these mAbs and identified non-neutralizing mAbs targeting the glycoprotein (GP) 2 portion of the mucin-like domain (MLD) of MARV GP, termed the wing region. One mAb targeting the GP2 wing, MR228, showed therapeutic protection in mice and guinea pigs infected with MARV. The protection was mediated by the Fc fragment functions of MR228. Binding of another GP2 wing-specific non-neutralizing mAb, MR235, to MARV GP increased accessibility of epitopes in the receptor-binding site (RBS) for neutralizing mAbs, resulting in enhanced virus neutralization by these mAbs. These findings highlight an important role for non-neutralizing mAbs during natural human MARV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) targeting gut microbiota has recently been successfully applied to ulcerative colitis. However, only a subset of patients responds to FMT, and there is a pressing need for biomarkers of responsiveness. Fungi (the mycobiota) represent a highly immunologically reactive component of the gut microbiota. We analyzed samples from a large randomized controlled trial of FMT for ulcerative colitis (UC). High Candida abundance pre-FMT was associated with a clinical response, whereas decreased Candida abundance post-FMT was indicative of ameliorated disease severity. High pre-FMT Candida was associated with increased bacterial diversity post-FMT, and the presence of genera was linked to FMT responsiveness. Although we detected elevated anti-Candida antibodies in placebo recipients, this increase was abrogated in FMT recipients. Our data suggest that FMT might reduce Candida to contain pro-inflammatory immunity during intestinal disease and highlight the utility of mycobiota–focused approaches to identify FMT responders prior to therapy initiation.

Abstract: Objective
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is a common renal obstructive disorder, but its pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unclear. We aimed to investigate the potential involvement of the renin–angiotensin system in congenital UPJO pathogenesis.
Methods
Differentially expressed proteins in exosomes isolated from amniotic fluid of patients with congenital UPJO were characterized using iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification)-based proteomics. The expressions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and aminopeptidase N (AP-N) in HK2 cells were inhibited by quinapril and siRNA, respectively. Cell proliferation and reactive oxygen species were measured by EdU staining and flow cytometry, respectively. Gene expression was detected by Western blot or qRT-PCR. The inflammatory factors were measured through ELISA. Mice that underwent unilateral ureteral obstruction were used as the animal model.
Results
The identity of exosomes from amniotic fluids was confirmed by the expression of CD9 and CD26. In total, 633 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the amniotic fluid-derived exosomes from patients with UPJO, including 376 up- and 257 down-regulated proteins associated with multiple biological processes. Of them, ACE and AP-N were significantly decreased in the amniotic fluid exosomes. Inhibition of ACE and AP-N resulted in suppressed cell proliferation; repressed IARP, AT1R, and MAS1 expression; elevated ROS production; and increased IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in HK2 cells. Decreased ACE expression and elevated IL-1β levels were also observed in the mouse model.
Conclusion
Suppression of ACE and AP-N expression mediates congenital UPJO pathogenesis by repressing renal tubular epithelial proliferation, promoting ROS production, and enhancing inflammatory factor expression.

Abstract: Differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into insulin (INS)-producing β-like cells has potential for diabetes research and therapy. Here, we generated a heterozygous fluorescent hiPSC reporter, labeling INS-producing β-like cells. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock-in a T2A-H2B-Cherry cassette to replace the translational INS stop codon, enabling co-transcription and T2A-peptide mediated co-translational cleavage of INS-T2A and H2B-Cherry. The hiPSC-INS-T2A-H2B-Cherry reporter cells were pluripotent and showed multi-lineage differentiation potential. Cells expressing the β-cell specific hormone INS are identified by nuclear localized H2B-Cherry reporter upon pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Thus, the generated reporter hiPSCs enable live identification of INS hormone-producing β-like cells.

Abstract: There is increasing interest in the possibility of culturing organ-like tissues (organoids) in vitro for biomedical applications. The ability to culture organoids would be greatly enhanced by having a functional circulation in vitro. The endothelial cell is the most important cell type in this context. Endothelial cells can be derived from pluripotent embryonic blastocyst cells in aggregates called embryoid bodies. Here, we examine the yield of endothelial-like cells in embryoid bodies (EBs) developed from transgenic zebrafish fli:GFP and kdrl:GFP blastocyst embryos. The isolated blastocyst cells developed into EBs within the first 24 h of culture and contained fli:GFP+ (putative endothelial, hematopoietic and other cell types); or kdrl:GFP+ (endothelial) cells. The addition of endothelial growth supplements to the media and culture on collagen type-I substratum increased the percentages of fli:GFP+ and kdrl:GFP+ cells in culture. We found that EBs developed in hanging-drop cultures possessed a higher percentage of fli:GFP+ (45.0 ± 3.1%) and kdrl:GFP+ cells (8.7 ± 0.7%) than those developed on conventional substrata (34.5 ± 1.4% or 5.2 ± 0.4%, respectively). The transcriptome analysis showed a higher expression of VEGF and TGFβ genes in EB cultures compared to the adherent cultures. When transferred to conventional culture, the percentage of fli:GFP+ or kdrl:GFP+ cells declined significantly over subsequent days in the EBs. The fli:GFP+ cells formed a monolayer around the embryoid bodies, while the kdrl:GFP+ cells formed vascular network-like structures in the embryoid bodies. Differences were observed in the spreading of fli:GFP+ cells, and network formation of kdrl:GFP+ cells on different substrates. The fli:GFP+ cells could be maintained in primary culture and sub-cultures. By contrast, kdrl:GFP+ cells were almost completely absent at 8d of primary culture. Our culture model allows real-time observation of fli:GFP+ and kdrl:GFP+ cells in culture. The results obtained from this study will be important for the development of vascular and endothelial cell culture using embryonic cells.

Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) represent an attractive model to investigate CM function and disease mechanisms. One characteristic marker of ventricular specificity of human CMs is expression of the ventricular, slow β-myosin heavy chain (MyHC), as opposed to the atrial, fast α-MyHC. The main aim of this study was to investigate at the single-cell level whether contraction kinetics and electrical activity of hESC-CMs are influenced by the relative expression of α-MyHC versus β-MyHC. For effective assignment of functional parameters to the expression of both MyHC isoforms at protein and mRNA levels in the very same hESC-CMs, we developed a single-cell mapping technique. Surprisingly, α- versus β-MyHC was not related to specific contractile or electrophysiological properties of the same cells. The multiparametric cell-by-cell analysis suggests that in hESC-CMs the expression of genes associated with electrical activity, contraction, calcium handling, and MyHCs is independently regulated.

Abstract: The formation of membrane protrusions during migration is reliant upon the cells’ cytoskeletal structure and stiffness. It has been reported that actin disruption blocks protrusion and decreases cell stiffness whereas microtubule disruption blocks protrusion but increases stiffness in several cell types. In melanoma, cell migration is of concern as this cancer spreads unusually rapidly during early tumour development. The aim of this study was to characterise motility, structural properties and stiffness of human melanoma cells at radial growth phase (RGP), vertical growth phase (VGP), and metastatic stage (MET) in two-dimensional in vitro environments. Wound assays, western blotting and mitochondrial particle tracking were used to assess cell migration, cytoskeletal content and intracellular fluidity. Our results indicate that cell motility increase with increasing disease stage. Despite their different motility, RGP and VGP cells exhibit similar fluidity, actin and tubulin levels. MET cells, however, display increased fluidity which was associated with increased actin and tubulin content. Our findings demonstrate an interplay between actin and microtubule activity and their role in increasing motility of cells while minimizing cell stiffness at advanced disease stage. In earlier disease stages, cell stiffness may however not serve as an indicator of migratory capabilities.

Abstract: HMGA2 is associated with the regulation of cellular biological processes in various human disorders and cancer progression, yet little is known about how HMGA2 controls tumorigenesis. This study uncovered the mechanism of HMGA2-mediated regulation of tumorigenicity in pancreatic cancer. We showed that HMGA2 was highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and correlated with poor prognosis. HMGA2 expression knockdown inhibited the tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer cells. Conversely, overexpression of HMGA2 promoted tumorigenicity. Combination of ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq and dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed HMGA2 could directly regulate ANLN expression. Furthermore, we found ANLN could mediate the HMGA2-induced effects on pancreatic cancer cells. The identification of the regulatory mechanism of HMGA2 and ANLN will provide insights into the progression for human pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Purpose
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a commonly diagnosed systemic autoimmune disease. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is closely linked to the development of RA. This study was conducted to explore the functions of the lncRNA LINC01197 in RA progression.
Methods
Differentially expressed lncRNAs/microRNAs/mRNAs in patients with RA were analyzed using RNA microarrays. A mouse model with RA was established and RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) were acquired for in vitro experiments. The function of LINC01197 in inflammation and RA progression in mice and its role in the viability of RA-FLS were determined by experiments involving its overexpression or suppression. The sub-cellular localization of LINC01197 was determined and the downstream molecules involved in LINC01197-mediated events were identified.
Results
LINC01197 was poorly expressed in the synovial tissues in the RA model mice. Overexpression of LINC01197 reduced RA severity in mice and inhibited proliferation and inflammatory responses as well as promoted apoptosis in RA-FLS. Online predictions and dual luciferase reporter gene assays suggested that LINC01197 could bind to miR-150 and further regulate THBS2 expression. LINC01197 promoted THBS2 expression through miR-150 sponging and inactivated the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, thus alleviating RA inflammation.
Conclusion
The current study suggested that LINC01197 sponged miR-150 to promote THBS2 expression, leading to TLR4/NF-κB inactivation, and ameliorated RA inflammation. These findings may offer new insights into RA treatment.

Abstract: Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) is a complex multifactorial disease that can be induced by inflammation and oxidative stress. Curcumin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Herein, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms of curcumin in TMJ OA were investigated. Curcumin treatment inhibited the expression of the inflammation mediators IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2 and of the matrix-degrading proteinases MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 and upregulated the mRNA levels of the cartilage anabolic factors COL2A1 and ACAN after IL-1β treatment. Curcumin treatment also decreased oxidative stress injury following IL-1β stimulation. Pathway analysis demonstrated that the ROS/Nrf2/HO-1-SOD2-NQO-1-GCLC signaling axis is a key axis through which curcumin activates the Nrf2/ARE pathway in TMJ inflammatory chondrocytes. Curcumin-induced anti-inflammatory and cartilage protective effects were significantly abrogated by specific Nrf2 siRNA. In vivo results demonstrated that curcumin treatment protected TMJ articular cartilage from progressive degradation. Our experimental results indicate that curcumin inhibits inflammation, oxidative stress, and the matrix degradation of TMJ inflammatory chondrocytes through the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, thereby exerting cartilage protective effects. This study provides insight into potential therapeutic approaches for TMJ OA.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of trained immunity by Bacille-Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination mediates beneficial heterologous effects, but the mechanisms underlying its persistence and magnitude remain elusive. In this study, we show that BCG vaccination in healthy human volunteers induces a persistent transcriptional program connected to myeloid cell development and function within the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment in the bone marrow. We identify hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) family members 1a and b as crucial regulators of this transcriptional shift. These findings are corroborated by higher granulocyte numbers in BCG-vaccinated infants, HNF1 SNP variants that correlate with trained immunity, and elevated serum concentrations of the HNF1 target alpha-1 antitrypsin. Additionally, transcriptomic HSPC remodeling was epigenetically conveyed to peripheral CD14+ monocytes, displaying an activated transcriptional signature three months after BCG vaccination. Taken together, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and functional reprogramming of HSPCs and peripheral monocytes is a hallmark of BCG-induced trained immunity in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Clonal evolution of osimertinib-resistance mechanisms in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma is poorly understood. Using multi-region whole-exome and RNA sequencing of prospectively collected pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors, including at rapid autopsies, we identify a likely mechanism driving osimertinib resistance in all patients analyzed. The majority of patients acquire two or more resistance mechanisms either concurrently or in temporal sequence. Focal copy-number amplifications occur subclonally and are spatially and temporally separated from common resistance mutations such as EGFR C797S. MET amplification occurs in 66% (n = 6/9) of first-line osimertinib-treated patients, albeit spatially heterogeneous, often co-occurs with additional acquired focal copy-number amplifications and is associated with early progression. Noteworthy osimertinib-resistance mechanisms discovered include neuroendocrine differentiation without histologic transformation, PD-L1, KRAS amplification, and ESR1-AKAP12, MKRN1-BRAF fusions. The subclonal co-occurrence of acquired genomic alterations upon osimertinib resistance will likely require targeting multiple resistance mechanisms by combination therapies.

Abstract: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, although non-apoptotic functions have also been reported for this cytokine in various cell types. TRAIL and its receptor TRAIL-R2 are expressed in skeletal muscles, but a potential role of muscle-derived TRAIL in myogenesis has not been explored. Here we report that TRAIL is an autocrine regulator of myogenic differentiation. Knockdown of TRAIL or TRAIL-R2 enhanced C2C12 myoblast differentiation, and recombinant TRAIL inhibited expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, accompanied by suppression of myoblasts from exiting the cell cycle, a requisite step in the myogenic differentiation process. Blocking cell cycle progression restored differentiation from inhibition by recombinant TRAIL, supporting the notion that TRAIL exerts its effect in myogenesis through modulating cell cycle exit. We also found that TRAIL knockdown led to enhanced muscle regeneration in mice upon injury, recapitulating the in vitro observation. Additionally, inhibition of ERK activation reversed the negative effect of recombinant TRAIL on p21 expression and myoblast differentiation, suggesting that ERK signaling may be a mediator of TRAIL's function to suppress cell cycle withdrawal and inhibit differentiation. Taken together, our findings uncover a muscle cell-autonomous non-apoptotic function of TRAIL in skeletal myogenesis.

Abstract: Background
The failure of hair follicle regeneration is the major cause of alopecia, which is a highly prevalent disease worldwide. Dermal papilla (DP) cells play important role in the regulation of hair follicle regeneration. However, the molecular mechanism of how dermal papilla cells direct follicle regeneration is still to be elucidated.
Methods
In vitro DP 3D culturing and in vivo nude mice DP sphere implanted models were used to examine the molecular regulation of DP cells and follicle regeneration. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect gene and protein expression, respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression level of Wnt10b, Ki-67 and β-catenin. Luciferase assay was used to examine the relationship among PCAT1, miR-329 and Wnt10b. ALP activity was measured by ELISA. H&E staining was used to measure follicle growth in skin tissues.
Results
Up-regulation of PCAT1 and Wnt10b, however, down-regulation of miR-329 were found in the in vitro 3D dermal papilla. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assays demonstrated that PCAT1 promoted Wnt10b expression by sponging miR-329. Knockdown of PCAT1 suppressed the proliferation and activity, as well as ALP and other DP markers of DP cells by targeting miR-329. Knockdown of PCAT1 regulated miR-329/Wnt10b axis to attenuate β-catenin expression and nucleus translocation to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, knockdown of PCAT1 suppressed DP sphere induced follicle regeneration and hair growth in nude mice.
Conclusion
PCAT1 maintains characteristics of DP cells by targeting miR-329 to activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby promoting hair follicle regeneration.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported to involve in pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). miR-142–5p is found increased in TLE, but its role remains unknown. In the study, we established a mouse model of status epilepticus (SE) with pilocarpine and a cell model of TLE. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed an up-regulation of miR-142–5p and down-regulation of mitochondrial Rho 1 (Miro1) in the mouse mode of SE. Administration of miR-142–5p antagomirs via intracerebroventricular injection attenuated pilocarpine-induced SE and hippocampal damage, and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction along with increased mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP and Ca (2+) levels. The expression of mitochondrial trafficking kinesin protein (Trak) 1 and Trak2 was up-regulated by inhibiting miR-142–5p. Antagomirs targeting miR-142–5p suppressed pilocarpine-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by decreased ROS generation and MPO activity, and increased SOD activity. Silencing miR-142–5p reduced neuronal death in pilocarpine-treated hippocampus and magnesium-free (MGF)-treated neurons. Inhibition of miR-142–5p decreased cytoplasmic Cytochrome C and increased mitochondrial Cytochrome C, reduced cleaved-caspase3 and Bax levels, and elevated Bcl2 in vivo and in vitro. Further, dual-luciferase assay verified Miro1 as a target of miR-142–5p, suggesting that miR-142–5p might function via targeting Mrio1. Depletion of Miro1 inhibited the protective effect of silencing miR-142–5p on hippocampal neurons in vitro. Taken together, down-regulation of miR-142–5p via targeting Miro1 inhibits neuronal death and mitochondrial dysfunction, and thus attenuates pilocarpine-induced SE, suggesting the potential involvement of miR-142–5p in the pathogenesis of TLE.

Abstract: Summary
The rational design of dengue virus (DENV) vaccines requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for antibody-mediated immunity. The durably protective antibody response to DENV after primary infection is serotype specific. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the antigenic determinants for DENV type-specific (TS) antibodies, especially for DENV serotype 3, which has only one well-studied, strongly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb). Here, we investigated the human B cell response in children after natural DENV infection in the endemic area of Nicaragua and isolated 15 DENV3 TS mAbs recognizing the envelope (E) glycoprotein. Functional epitope mapping of these mAbs and small animal prophylaxis studies revealed a complex landscape with protective epitopes clustering in at least 6–7 antigenic sites. Potently neutralizing TS mAbs recognized sites principally in E glycoprotein domains I and II, and patterns suggest frequent recognition of quaternary structures on the surface of viral particles.

Abstract: Summary
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is strongly dependent on thyroid hormone (TH). Whether TH signaling regulates this process in a cell-autonomous or non-autonomous manner remains unknown. To answer this question, we used global and conditional knockouts of the TH transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), having first used FACS and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that MCT8 is the only TH transporter expressed on neuroblasts and adult slice cultures to confirm a necessary role for MCT8 in neurogenesis. Both mice with a global deletion or an adult neural stem cell-specific deletion of MCT8 showed decreased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor P27KIP1, reduced differentiation of neuroblasts, and impaired generation of new granule cell neurons, with global knockout mice also showing enhanced neuroblast proliferation. Together, our results reveal a cell-autonomous role for TH signaling in adult hippocampal neurogenesis alongside non-cell-autonomous effects on cell proliferation earlier in the lineage.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignancy in thyroid. miR-744–5p plays an efficient role in various cancers, but its role in PTC remains unknown. In this work, we aimed to explore the function of miR-744–5p and the mechanism by which miR-744–5p acted in PTC. We observed that miR-744–5p expression was significantly declined in PTC tissues and cell lines. The high level of miR-744–5p is significantly associated with a better clinical picture of PTC patients. Overexpression of miR-744–5p inhibited the proliferation, arrested the cell cycle, and promoted the apoptosis in PTC cells. Oppositely, down-regulation of miR-744–5p reversed the above tendencies. We also found that miR-744–5p down-regulated its downstream genes c-myc and attenuated cell proliferation induced by c-myc. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTTIP was found to be up-regulated and to act as an oncogene in PTC. In this study, miR-744–5p bound to HOTTIP and was negatively regulated by HOTTIP. In conclusion, miR-744-5p acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of PTC cells via targeting c-myc. Moreover, miR-744-5p expression interferes with lncRNA HOTTIP ability to promote proliferation and downregulate apoptosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Abstract: The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a Southern Ocean endemic species of proven ecological importance to the region. In the context of predicted global warming, it is particularly important to understand how classic biomarkers of heat stress function in this species. In this respect, Hsp70s are acknowledged as good candidates. However, previous studies of expression kinetics have not been able to demonstrate significant upregulation of these genes in response to heat shocks at 3°C and 6°C for 3 and 6 h. The current work complements these previous results and broadens the prospects for the use of Hsp70s as a relevant marker of thermal shock in this krill species. New experiments demonstrate that induction of Hsp70 isoforms was not detected during exposure to heat shock, but increased expression was observed after several hours of recovery. To complete the analysis of the expression kinetics of the different isoforms, experiments were carried out over short time scales (1 and 2 h at 3°C and 6 °C) as well as at higher temperatures (9 °C, 12 °C, and 15°C for 3 h), without any significant response. A 6-week monitoring of animals at 3°C showed that the time factor is decisive in the establishment of the response. CTmax experiments with incremental times of 1°C per day or 1°C every 3 days have shown a particularly high resilience of the animals. The demonstration of the abundance of Hsp70s present before thermal stress in various species of krill, as well as in specimens of E. superba of various origins, showed that the delay in the response in expression could be related to the high constitutive levels of Hsp70 available before the stress experiments. The alternative labelling of the two main isoforms of Hsp70 according to the origin of the animals allowed hypotheses to be put forward on the functioning of thermoregulation in Antarctic krill as well as ice krill.

Abstract: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a significant obstacle for immunotherapy of cancer. It is of great clinical relevance to study the mechanism of MDSCs accumulation in mouse spleens and establish a stable method to obtain high-purity MDSCs in vitro for further research. Here, we established a new method for amplifying a large number of highly pure MDSCs in vitro. To mimic the microenvironment of MDSCs development in vivo, mouse splenic stroma feeder cells and serum-free medium containing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were used to induce myeloid precursors in mouse bone marrow cells, which differentiate into MDSCs. Development and immunological functions of the cells were monitored both in vivo and in vitro. A total of 4 × 108 MDSCs could be obtained from the bone marrow from one mouse, the ratio of CD11b+Gr-1+ MDSCs could reach 93.8% ± 3.3% after nine days of culture in vitro. Cultured MDSCs maintained a similar immunophenotype with MDSCs found in tumor-bearing mice. Colony forming assay in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that these were myeloid precursor cells. These cells generated high levels of reactive oxygen species and arginase 1 to prevent proliferation of CD8+ T cells in vitro. These also increased regulatory T (Treg) cells in blood while promoting the growth of lymphoma in vivo. In addition, cultured MDSCs effectively inhibited acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Our findings suggest that mouse splenic stroma plays an important role in the generation of MDSCs and represent a preliminary mechanism for the accumulation of MDSCs in spleens, and thereby lay the foundation for basic research and the clinical application of MDSCs.

Abstract: The HSP60/HSP10 chaperonin assists folding of proteins in the mitochondrial matrix space by enclosing them in its central cavity. The chaperonin forms part of the mitochondrial protein quality control system. It is essential for cellular survival and mutations in its subunits are associated with rare neurological disorders. Here we present the first survey of interactors of the human mitochondrial HSP60/HSP10 chaperonin. Using a protocol involving metabolic labeling of HEK293 cells, cross-linking, and immunoprecipitation of HSP60, we identified 323 interacting proteins. As expected, the vast majority of these proteins are localized to the mitochondrial matrix space. We find that approximately half of the proteins annotated as mitochondrial matrix proteins interact with the HSP60/HSP10 chaperonin. They cover a broad spectrum of functions and metabolic pathways including the mitochondrial protein synthesis apparatus, the respiratory chain, and mitochondrial protein quality control. Many of the genes encoding HSP60 interactors are annotated as disease genes. There is a correlation between relative cellular abundance and relative abundance in the HSP60 immunoprecipitates. Nineteen abundant matrix proteins occupy more than 60% of the HSP60/HSP10 chaperonin capacity. The reported inventory of interactors can form the basis for interrogating which proteins are especially dependent on the chaperonin.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (hESC-RPE) cells could serve as a replacement therapy in advanced stages of age-related macular degeneration. However, allogenic hESC-RPE transplants trigger immune rejection, supporting a strategy to evade their immune recognition. We established single-knockout beta-2 microglobulin (SKO-B2M), class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator (SKO-CIITA) and double-knockout (DKO) hESC lines that were further differentiated into corresponding hESC-RPE lines lacking either surface human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) or HLA-II, or both. Activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was markedly lower by hESC-RPE DKO cells, while natural killer cell cytotoxic response was not increased. After transplantation of SKO-B2M, SKO-CIITA, or DKO hESC-RPEs in a preclinical rabbit model, donor cell rejection was reduced and delayed. In conclusion, we have developed cell lines that lack both HLA-I and -II antigens, which evoke reduced T-cell responses in vitro together with reduced rejection in a large-eyed animal model.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of T helper (Th) 1 versus Th2 immunity on intracellular infections is attributed to classical versus alternative activation of macrophages leading to resistance or susceptibility. However, observations in multiple infectious settings demonstrate deficiencies in mediators of Th1-Th2 immunity, which have paradoxical or no impact. We report that prior to influencing activation, Th1/Th2 immunity first controls the size of the permissive host cell reservoir. During early Leishmania infection of the skin, IFN-γ- or STAT6-mediated changes in phagocyte activation were counteracted by changes in IFN-γ-mediated recruitment of permissive CCR2+ monocytes. Monocytes were required for early parasite expansion and acquired an alternatively activated phenotype despite the Th1 dermal environment required for their recruitment. Surprisingly, STAT6 did not enhance intracellular parasite proliferation, but rather modulated the size and permissiveness of the monocytic host cell reservoir via regulation of IFN-γ and IL-10. These observations expand our understanding of the Th1-Th2 paradigm during infection.

Abstract: Summary
The CDY (chromodomain on the Y) proteins play an essential role in normal spermatogenesis and brain development. Dysregulation of their expression has been linked to male infertility and various neurological diseases. Like the chromodomains of HP1 and Polycomb, the CDY chromodomains also recognize the lysine-methylated ARKS motif embedded in histone and non-histone proteins. Interestingly, the CDY chromodomains exhibit different binding preferences for the lysine-methylated ARKS motif in different sequence contexts. Here, we present the structural basis for selective binding of CDY1 to H3K9me3 and preferential binding of CDYL2 to H3tK27me3 over H3K27me3. In addition, we use a CDYL1/2-selective compound, UNC4850, to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CDYL2 binding specificity. Our work also provides critical implications that CDYL1b's role in the regulation of neural development is dependent on its recognition of the lysine-methylated ARKS motif.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes-associated complication characterized by irreversible deterioration of the microvessels within the retina, leading subsequently to severe retinal damage and vision loss. Vitamin D (VITD), a steroid hormone, plays multiple physiological functions in cellular homeostasis. Deficiency of VITD has been suggested to be associated with DR. To study the potential protective function of VITD in DR, high-glucose-treated ARPE-19 cells and STZ-induced diabetic mice were used as in vitro and in vivo models. The protective effects of VITD were assessed based on the changes of expression of antioxidant enzymes and cytokines in high-glucose-treated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and in the retina and RPE of diabetic and VITD-treated diabetic mice. The present study demonstrated that exposure to a high level of glucose caused upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decrease in anti-oxidant enzyme expression in both in vitro and in vivo models. VITD treatment increased cell viability, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and caspase-3/7 activities in high-glucose-treated RPE cells. Our data suggest that VITD can protect the retina and RPE from high-glucose-induced oxidative damage and inflammation.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in autoimmunity, immune homeostasis, and presentation of tumor antigens to T cells in order to prime antitumor responses. The number of tumor-infiltrating DCs is associated with survival and prognosis in cancer. Twist1 is a well-known regulator of tumor initiation and promotion, but whether and how DC-derived Twist1 regulates antitumor responses remains poorly understood. Here, we generated a mouse line with Twist1 conditionally depleted in DCs and found that Twist1-deficiency in DCs did not affect the DCs and T cell homeostasis under steady-state conditions; however, in melanoma models, the proportion of conventional DCs (cDCs) in draining lymph nodes (DLNs) was significantly decreased. Accordingly, a decreased ratio and number of tumor-infiltrating cDCs were observed, which reduced the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Furthermore, production of IFN-γ, a crucial antitumor factor, by T cells, was dramatically decreased, which can further dampen the T cell antitumor functions. Collectively, our data indicate that Twist1 in DCs regulates antitumor functions by maintain the number of tumor-infiltrating DCs and T cells, and their antitumor activity.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin (Ig) A controls host-microbial homeostasis in the gut. IgA recognition of beneficial bacteria is decreased in acutely undernourished children, but the factors driving these changes in IgA targeting are unknown. Child undernutrition is a global health challenge that is exacerbated by poor sanitation and intestinal inflammation. To understand how nutrition impacts immune-microbe interactions, we used a mouse model of undernutrition with or without fecal-oral exposure and assessed IgA-bacterial targeting from weaning to adulthood. In contrast to healthy control mice, undernourished mice fail to develop IgA recognition of intestinal Lactobacillus. Glycan-mediated interactions between Lactobacillus and host antibodies are lost in undernourished mice due to rapid bacterial adaptation. Lactobacillus adaptations occur in direct response to nutritional pressure, independently of host IgA, and are associated with reduced mucosal colonization and with bacterial mutations in carbohydrate processing genes. Together these data indicate that diet-driven bacterial adaptations shape IgA recognition in the gut.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from diverse humans offer the potential to study human functional variation in controlled culture environments. A portion of this variation originates from an ancient admixture between modern humans and Neandertals, which introduced alleles that left a phenotypic legacy on individual humans today. Here, we show that a large iPSC repository harbors extensive Neandertal DNA, including alleles that contribute to human phenotypes and diseases, encode hundreds of amino acid changes, and alter gene expression in specific tissues. We provide a database of the inferred introgressed Neandertal alleles for each individual iPSC line, together with the annotation of the predicted functional variants. We also show that transcriptomic data from organoids generated from iPSCs can be used to track Neandertal-derived RNA over developmental processes. Human iPSC resources provide an opportunity to experimentally explore Neandertal DNA function and its contribution to present-day phenotypes, and potentially study Neandertal traits.

Abstract: AarF domain containing kinase 5 (ADCK5) is a member of an atypical kinase family and overexpressed in many carcinomas including lung cancer, while the function of this protein has not been elucidated. Here we investigated the mechanism of ADCK5 involved in regulating invasion and migration of lung cancer cells, and showed that ADCK5 might regulate the expression of tumor oncogene human pituitary tumor transforming gene-1 (PTTG1) by phosphorylating transcription factor SOX9, therefore enhancing the migration and invasion capabilities of lung cancer cells. Mutagenesis of potential serine phosphorylation sites on SOX9 indicated that serine 181 might be required to maintain transcription activation of SOX9 as well as increase PTTG1 levels. The serine 181 site of SOX9 is in a motif that is targeted by ADCK5. The ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway might be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.

Abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been reported to be involved in several biological processes in tumors. In this study, we found that most of the m6A RNA methylation regulators were not only differentially expressed between clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and normal but also among ccRCC stratified by different clinicopathologic characters. Two ccRCC subgroups, cluster 1 and 2, were identified using consensus clustering based on the expression of m6A methylation regulators. Although no obvious differences were observed between two subgroups regarding clinicopathologic characters, except gender, patients in cluster 1 had a relatively more favorable survival rate than cluster 2. Moreover, we established a risk signature with two m6A methylation regulators, METTL3 and METTL14, which was not only of great value for prognosis prediction but also closely associated with clinicopathological features. In conclusion, m6A RNA methylation regulators play an important role in ccRCC progression and are potentially favorable for prognostic stratification.

Abstract: Methyl-CpG-binding domain 3 (MBD3), as an induced stem cells reprogramming barrier, has an abnormal expression in various prevalent malignancies. However, in pancreatic cancer cell stemness, the roles of MBD3 remain unclear. In our study, the effects of MBD3 were investigated on the proliferation, stemness and the underlying mechanism in pancreatic cancer cells. Firstly, MBD3 knockdown was proved to promote proliferation and sphere formation of pancreatic cancer cells and tumorigenesis, while MBD3 upregulation inhibited the above results. Also, MBD3 downregulation notably increased stemness markers level of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, and MBD3 upregulation resulted in the opposite effects. Mechanically, it was found that MBD3 involved in activation of Hippo pathway. There was a negative correlation between MBD3 and YAP expression in TCGA database. MBD3 knockdown improved YAP expression, and promoted YAP nuclear translocation increased TEAD luciferase activity, while MBD3 overexpression reversed the above results. Further evidence revealed that YAP could bind to MBD3, and decreased MBD3 expression. Collectively, MBD3 bound to YAP to significantly inhibit proliferation and weaken stemness maintenance in pancreatic cancer cells, as well as reduce tumorigenesis via Hippo signaling. Thus, MBD3 may serve as a potential molecular biomarker for exploring new therapeutic strategies to treat pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The embryonic epicardium, originating from the proepicardial organ (PEO), provides a source of multipotent progenitors for cardiac lineages, including pericytes, fibroblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Maximizing the regenerative capacity of the adult epicardium depends on recapitulating embryonic cell fates. The potential of the epicardium to contribute coronary endothelium is unclear, due to conflicting Cre-based lineage trace data. Controversy also surrounds when epicardial cell fate becomes restricted. Here, we systematically investigate expression of five widely used epicardial markers, Wt1, Tcf21, Tbx18, Sema3d, and Scx, over the course of development. We show overlap of markers in all PEO and epicardial cells until E13.5, and find no evidence for discrete proepicardial sub-compartments that might contribute coronary endothelium via the epicardial layer. Our findings clarify a number of prevailing discrepancies and support the notion that epicardium-derived cell fate, to form fibroblasts or mural cells, is specified after epithelial-mesenchymal transition, not pre-determined within the PEO.

Abstract: Sense of taste is central to evaluate food before digestion. Taste stem cells undergo constant differentiation throughout the life. However, the mechanism underlying the generation of taste receptor cells is still not clear. Here, we cultured taste organoids from either Lgr5+ or Lgr5-cells, and found the preferential generation of Car4+ and Gustducin + taste receptor cells in organoids derived from Lgr5+ cells in circumvallate, foliate or fungiform papillae. Taste organoids derived from Lgr5+ cells in circumvallate papillae of neonatal mice showed stronger capacity to generate taste receptor cells compared to the organoids from Lgr5+ cells of the adult circumvallate papillae. Massive transcriptional differences were found in multiple signaling pathways including taste transduction between organoids derived from circumvallate papillae of adult and neonatal mice. Inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway by LY411575 enhanced taste receptor cell generation in organoids from circumvallate papillae and modulated multiple signaling pathways. Thus, we concluded that receptor cell generation in taste organoids was age-related and regulated via multiple signaling pathways.

Abstract: Melanoma is characterized by high heterogeneity and plasticity, most likely due to the presence of mutated melanocyte stem cells or immature progenitor cells in the skin that serves as precursors to melanoma. In the present study, for the first time, we identified rare cells in the murine melanoma B16F10, and human A2058 and SK-MEL-28 cell lines that express pluripotency markers, including Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and a marker of melanoma cancer cells (ALDH1/2). These cells are very small with round morphology and they grow onto melanoma cells, thereby demonstrating feeder layer dependence similar to that of other pluripotent cells. These cells underwent self-renewal, symmetric and asymmetric division. We called these cells murine very small cancer stem cells (VSCSC). VSCSC were also found in B16F10-derived clones after 3–5 consecutive passages, where they occur as single cells or as small colonies, nevertheless, always using melanoma cells as feeders. These cells formed melanospheres enriched with Oct4-and ALDH1/2-positive cells. We also evaluated the possible effect of VSCSC that presented in the parental cell line (B16F10) and in clones based on their functional characteristics. We found that VCSCS present in the B16F10 cell line reappearing in their clones were required for continuous tumor growth and were responsible for melanoma cell heterogeneity and plasticity rather than directly affecting functional characteristics of melanoma cells. Our data, together with those of previous reports suggested the existence of melanoma-competent melanocyte stem cells, which corroborate the hypothesis of the existence of tumor-initiating cells and cancer stem cell hierarchies, at least in melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Ovarian cancer (OC) represents the most dismal gynecological cancer. Pathobiology is poorly understood, mainly due to lack of appropriate study models. Organoids, defined as self-developing three-dimensional in vitro reconstructions of tissues, provide powerful tools to model human diseases. Here, we established organoid cultures from patient-derived OC, in particular from the most prevalent high-grade serous OC (HGSOC). Testing multiple culture medium components identified neuregulin-1 (NRG1) as key factor in maximizing OC organoid development and growth, although overall derivation efficiency remained moderate (36% for HGSOC patients, 44% for all patients together). Established organoid lines showed patient tumor-dependent morphology and disease characteristics, and recapitulated the parent tumor's marker expression and mutational landscape. Moreover, the organoids displayed tumor-specific sensitivity to clinical HGSOC chemotherapeutic drugs. Patient-derived OC organoids provide powerful tools for the study of the cancer's pathobiology (such as importance of the NRG1/ERBB pathway) as well as advanced preclinical tools for (personalized) drug screening and discovery.

Abstract: Berberine (BBR) is routinely prescribed in many Asian countries to treat diarrhea. Evidence from both animal and clinical investigations suggests that BBR exerts diverse pharmacological activities, including antidiabetic, antineoplastic, antihypertensive, and antiatherosclerotic effects. This study aimed to explore the cardioprotective mechanisms of BBR and to elucidate the modulations between autophagy and mitochondrial function during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in H9c2 cells. The degree of autophagic flux was assessed by pretreating H9c2 cells with BBR prior to H/R exposure and measuring the expression levels of Beclin-1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled LC3B fusion proteins as well as the LC3II/LC3I ratio. The mitochondrial membrane potential (△Ψm) in H9c2 cells was evaluated by detecting rhodamine-123 fluorescence using flow cytometry. The results revealed that pretreatment with BBR upregulated autophagic flux and protected against the loss of the △Ψm in H9c2 cells subjected to H/R. We conclude that BBR attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction by inducing autophagic flux.

Abstract: Compared with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, targeted therapeutic medicine has the advantages of high efficacy and less toxic side effects. However, in clinical practice for treatment of colorectal cancer, the primary and acquired resistance of these medicines limits their effectiveness in targeted therapy, therefore impedes the development of precision medicine and personalized therapy. Currently, there are limited number of drugs for targeted therapy of colorectal cancer, mainly monoclonal antibodies against EGFR or VEGFR inhibitors. Trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, has been applied in melanoma patient successfully, but not been used in clinical treatment of colorectal cancer because of its drug resistance. To identify the resistance mechanism of colorectal cancer cells to trametinib and find useful chemical combination to overcome the resistance, we screened primary and acquired cell line first and then tested multiple synergistic drug combinations by using the Chou-Talalay method. We obtained the primary resistant cell lines SW480, CW-2 and the acquired drug-resistant cell line RKO-R as well as a synergistic combination of trametinib and GSK2126458. This combination inhibits the colony formation of colorectal cancer cells and the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. Mechanistic analysis showed that trametinib can activate the alternative PI3K-AKT signaling pathway while inhibiting the MAPK pathway, which may be one of the molecular mechanisms of primary and acquired trametinib tolerance in colorectal cancer cells. Importantly, this bypass activation can be blocked by GSK2126458. These results suggest that a combination of trametinib and GSK2126458 is an effective approach for treating colorectal cancer resistance to trametinib.

Abstract: Summary
Lifestyle, obesity, and the gut microbiome are important risk factors for metabolic disorders. We demonstrate in 1,976 subjects of a German population cohort (KORA) that specific microbiota members show 24-h oscillations in their relative abundance and identified 13 taxa with disrupted rhythmicity in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cross-validated prediction models based on this signature similarly classified T2D. In an independent cohort (FoCus), disruption of microbial oscillation and the model for T2D classification was confirmed in 1,363 subjects. This arrhythmic risk signature was able to predict T2D in 699 KORA subjects 5 years after initial sampling, being most effective in combination with BMI. Shotgun metagenomic analysis functionally linked 26 metabolic pathways to the diurnal oscillation of gut bacteria. Thus, a cohort-specific risk pattern of arrhythmic taxa enables classification and prediction of T2D, suggesting a functional link between circadian rhythms and the microbiome in metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Tight junctions in mammals and septate junctions in insects are essential for epithelial integrity. We show here that, in the Drosophila intestine, smooth septate junction proteins provide barrier and signaling functions. During an RNAi screen for genes that regulate adult midgut tissue growth, we found that loss of two smooth septate junction components, Snakeskin and Mesh, caused a hyperproliferation phenotype. By examining epitope-tagged endogenous Snakeskin and Mesh, we demonstrate that the two proteins are present in the cytoplasm of differentiating enteroblasts and in cytoplasm and septate junctions of mature enterocytes. In both enteroblasts and enterocytes, loss of Snakeskin and Mesh causes Yorkie-dependent expression of the JAK-STAT pathway ligand Upd3, which in turn promotes proliferation of intestinal stem cells. Snakeskin and Mesh form a complex with each other, with other septate junction proteins and with Yorkie. Therefore, the Snakeskin-Mesh complex has both barrier and signaling function to maintain stem cell-mediated tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Typhoidal and non-typhoidal Salmonelleae (NTS) cause typhoid fever and gastroenteritis, respectively, in humans. Salmonella typhoid toxin contributes to typhoid disease progression and chronic infection, but little is known about the role of its NTS ortholog. We found that typhoid toxin and its NTS ortholog induce different clinical presentations. The PltB subunit of each toxin exhibits different glycan-binding preferences that correlate with glycan expression profiles of host cells targeted by each bacterium at the primary infection or intoxication sites. Through co-crystal structures of PltB subunits bound to specific glycan receptor moieties, we show that they induce markedly different glycan-binding preferences and virulence outcomes. Furthermore, immunization with the NTS S. Javiana or its toxin offers cross-reactive protection against lethal-dose typhoid toxin challenge. Cumulatively, these results offer insights into the evolution of host adaptations in Salmonella AB toxins, their cell and tissue tropisms, and the design for improved typhoid vaccines and therapeutics.

Abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common lung disorders characterized by alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and dyspnea, which can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Currently, a cluster of acute respiratory illnesses, known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which allegedly originally occurred in Wuhan, China, has increased rapidly worldwide. The critically ill patients with ARDS have high mortality in subjects with comorbidities. Previously, the excessive recruitment and activation of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]), accompanied by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation were reported being implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. However, the direct visualization of lung epithelial injuries caused by NETs, and the qualitative and quantitative evaluations of this damage are still lacking. Additionally, those already reported methods are limited for their neglect of the pathological role exerted by NETs and focusing only on the morphological features of NETosis. Therefore, we established a cell-based assay for detecting NETs during lung epithelial cells-neutrophils co-culture using the xCELLigence system, a recognized real-time, dynamic, label-free, sensitive, and high-throughput apparatus. Our results demonstrated that lung epithelial injuries, reflected by declines in cell index (CI) values, could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated PMNs, or NETs in a time and dose-dependent manner. NETs generation was verified to be the major contributor to the cytotoxicity of activated PMNs; protein components of NETs were the prevailing cytotoxic mediators. Moreover, this cell-based assay identified that PMNs from severe pneumonia patients had a high NETs formative potential. Additionally, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) were discovered alleviating NETs formation. Thus, this study not only presents a new methodology for detecting the pathophysiologic role of NETs but also lays down a foundation for exploring therapeutic interventions in an effort to cure ALI/ARDS in the clinical setting of severe pneumonia, including the emerging of NCIP.

Abstract: Understanding interactions between immune cells and their targets is an important step on the path to fully characterizing the immune system, and in doing so, learning how it combats disease. Many studies of these interactions have a narrow focus, often looking only at a binary result of whether or not a specific treatment was successful or only focusing on the interactions between two individual cells. Therefore, in an effort to more comprehensively study multicellular interactions among immune cells and their targets, we used in vitro longitudinal time-lapse imaging and developed an automated cell cluster analysis tool, or macro, to investigate the formation of cell clusters. In particular, we investigated the behavior of cancer-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells on how they interact around their targets: cancer cells and antigen-presenting cells. The macro that we established allowed us to examine these large-scale clustering behaviors taking place between those four cell types. Thus, we were able to distinguish directed immune cell clustering from random cell movement. Furthermore, this macro can be generalized to be applicable to systems consisting of any number of differently labeled species and can be used to track clustering behaviors and compare them to randomized simulations.

Abstract: Phagocytosis is a basic immune response to the invasion of pathogens. High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) is a DNA chaperone that is associated with phagocytosis. However, its influence on phagocytosis is debated. In the present study, HMGB1-mutant, HMGB1-overexpressing and HMGB1-silenced RAW264.7 cells were constructed. In addition, HMGB1 conditional knockout mice were constructed to determine the influence of HMGB1 on phagocytosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Zymosan particles were used to test the phagocytic function of the macrophages. Our results showed that the accumulation of HMGB1 in the nucleus enhances the phagocytic function of the macrophages. By interacting with P53, nuclear HMGB1 may remain in the nucleus and decrease the negative influence of P53 on the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The increase in phosphorylated FAK promotes the formation of pseudopods and enhances the phagocytic ability of macrophages.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines have previously been generated through the NHLBI sponsored NextGen program at nine individual study sites. Here, we examined the structural integrity of 506 hiPSC lines as determined by copy number variations (CNVs). We observed that 149 hiPSC lines acquired 258 CNVs relative to donor DNA. We identified six recurrent regions of CNVs on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 16 and 20 that overlapped with cancer associated genes. Furthermore, the genes mapping to regions of acquired CNVs show an enrichment in cancer related biological processes (IL6 production) and signaling cascades (JNK cascade & NFκB cascade). The genomic region of instability on chr20 (chr20q11.2) includes transcriptomic signatures for cancer associated genes such as ID1, BCL2L1, TPX2, PDRG1 and HCK. Of these HCK shows statistically significant differential expression between carrier and non-carrier hiPSC lines. Overall, while a low level of genomic instability was observed in the NextGen generated hiPSC lines, the observation of structural instability in regions with known cancer associated genes substantiates the importance of systematic evaluation of genetic variations in hiPSCs before using them as disease/research models.

Abstract: Activator protein-1 (AP-1) plays a decisive role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation under hypoxia; thus, AP-1 subunits or dimers could be modulated for a desired phenomenon in a cell using a suitable compound of therapeutic potential. Herein, we used Tanshinone-IIA as an AP-1 (subunits) modulator, and the purpose of the study was to investigate the signaling mechanism exhibited by Tan-IIA in facilitating tolerance to hypoxia. A549 cells were pretreated with Tan-IIA and exposed to hypoxia for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Biochemical and molecular parameters were assessed in order to trace the signaling pathway. Tan-IIA attenuated hypoxia-induced oxidative stress by modulating the expression of AP-1 subunits (via. MAPK) and Nrf2 transcription factor, which in turn were responsible for maintaining the higher levels of antioxidant enzymes and genes (HO). Tan-IIA increased the cell survival. This could be attributed to an increased NO level via iNOS gene and activated JNK, ERK pathway that induced c-jun/c-fos, c-jun/fosB, junD/c-fos, and junD/fosB heterodimers. This in turn leads to the cell cycle progression by activating cyclins (D and B). This was further confirmed by the lower levels of p53 and their downstream genes (p16, p21, p27). In addition, Tan-IIA decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels by inhibiting the formation of junB/fra-1 heterodimer regulated by p38. Tan-IIA increased cell survival to hypoxia by maintaining the higher levels of cellular iNOS, HO-1, jun-D, c-jun, fos B via Nrf2-AP-1.

Abstract: Summary
The Parkinson's disease-associated gene, LRRK2, is also associated with immune disorders and infectious disease and is expressed in immune subsets. Here, we characterize a platform for interrogating the expression and function of endogenous LRRK2 in authentic human phagocytes using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages and microglia. Endogenous LRRK2 is expressed and upregulated by interferon-γ in these cells, including a 187-kDa cleavage product. Using LRRK2 knockout and G2019S isogenic repair lines, we find that LRRK2 is not involved in initial phagocytic uptake of bioparticles but is recruited to LAMP1+/RAB9+ “maturing” phagosomes, and LRRK2 kinase inhibition enhances its residency at the phagosome. Importantly, LRRK2 is required for RAB8a and RAB10 recruitment to phagosomes, implying that LRRK2 operates at the intersection between phagosome maturation and recycling pathways in these professional phagocytes.

Abstract: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H is a member of hnRNP H/F protein subfamily of hnRNPs that regulate the maturation and post-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNA. As a component of an mRNA export complex, hnRNP H shuttles mature mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Although hnRNP H is primarily a nuclear protein, it can accumulate in the cytoplasm in certain tissues and cell types; however, the physiological relevance of hnRNP H cytoplasmic accumulation is unknown. Here we show that under cellular stress hnRNP H accumulates in the cytoplasm and is required for efficient recovery from cellular stress. Moreover, we find that cytoplasmic hnRNP H localizes to stress granules and that the RRM3 domain of hnRNP H is necessary for this localization. Together, our results demonstrate that hnRNP H accumulates in the cytoplasm under cellular stress and is recruited to stress granules.

Abstract: Obesity is a significant breast cancer (BC) risk factor and is associated with 20–40% increased risk in obese post-menopausal women compared to their lean counterparts. Several obesity-related metabolic dysregulations have been linked to BC risk, including overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Currently, RAS inhibitors including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are used as safe and effective anti-hypertensive therapies in BC patients. However, it is uncertain how inhibition of RAS in adipose tissue impacts obesity-BC crosstalk. We hypothesized that adipose RAS inhibition will reduce BC cell motility and inflammation. We determined (1) the direct effects of Ang II, ACEi (captopril; Cap) or ARB (telmisartan; Tel) on receptor positive MCF-7 and receptor triple negative MDA-MB-231 cells; and (2) the effects of conditioned media (CM) from human mesenchymal stem cells differentiated into adipocytes, which were pretreated with RAS inhibitors, on BC cells. We demonstrated that direct treatments of BC cells with Ang II, Cap or Tel did not alter inflammatory cytokines in either BC cell line. However, CM from Ang II-pretreated adipocytes significantly increased secretion of pro-inflammatory markers at protein level. RAS inhibitors reduced their secretion in MDA-MB-231, but not in MCF-7 cells. Additionally, CM from adipocytes treated with RAS inhibitors significantly reduced markers of inflammation, fat synthesis, and angiogenesis in both BC cell lines. Furthermore, CM from ACEi pretreated adipocytes reduced cell motility in both BC cell lines. Findings from our study indicate an important role of adipose RAS inhibition in adipocyte and BC cell crosstalk.

Abstract: We evaluated the synergistic effects of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in an interstitial cystitis (IC) rat model. After generation of the IC rat model, the rats were divided into 4 groups according to the treatment they received: phosphate-buffered saline injection into bladder submucosa, daily oral PPS feeding, MSC injection into bladder submucosa, or MSC injection into bladder submucosa with daily oral PPS feeding. After treatment, conscious cystometry and pain scale measurement were performed and their bladders were obtained for histological and proinflammatory-related gene expression analysis. On cystometric analysis, all treatment groups showed significantly increased intercontraction intervals and lower pain scores compared to those of the control group. Histological analysis revealed regenerated urothelium, less fibrosis, and decreased mast cell infiltration in all treatment groups compared to the control group. Significantly lower expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, MCP, IL-6, TLR2, and TLR11 was observed in the PPS with MSC group compared to the other groups. Combination therapy with PPS and MSCs showed histological and functional effects in an IC rat model, including synergistic effects leading to increased intercontraction interval and decreased inflammatory reactions.

Abstract: Summary
The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscores the urgency to develop experimental systems for studying this virus and identifying countermeasures. We report a reverse genetic system for SARS-CoV-2. Seven complimentary DNA (cDNA) fragments spanning the SARS-CoV-2 genome were assembled into a full-genome cDNA. RNA transcribed from the full-genome cDNA was highly infectious after electroporation into cells, producing 2.9 × 106 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL of virus. Compared with a clinical isolate, the infectious-clone-derived SARS-CoV-2 (icSARS-CoV-2) exhibited similar plaque morphology, viral RNA profile, and replication kinetics. Additionally, icSARS-CoV-2 retained engineered molecular markers and did not acquire other mutations. We generated a stable mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) by introducing this reporter gene into ORF7 of the viral genome. icSARS-CoV-2-mNG was successfully used to evaluate the antiviral activities of interferon (IFN). Collectively, the reverse genetic system and reporter virus provide key reagents to study SARS-CoV-2 and develop countermeasures.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is increased in maternal serum and amniotic fluid of children subsequently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. However, it is not clear how increased IL-6 alters brain development. Here, we show that IL-6 increases the prevalence of a specific platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-responsive multipotent progenitor, with opposite effects on neural stem cells and on subsets of bipotential glial progenitors. Acutely, increasing circulating IL-6 levels 2-fold above baseline in neonatal mice specifically stimulated the proliferation of a PDGF-responsive multipotential progenitor accompanied by increased phosphorylated STAT3, increased Fbxo15 expression, and decreased Dnmt1 and Tlx expression. Fate mapping studies using a Nestin-CreERT2 driver revealed decreased astrogliogenesis in the frontal cortex. IL-6-treated mice were hyposmic; however, olfactory bulb neuronogenesis was unaffected. Altogether, these studies provide important insights into how inflammation alters neural stem cells and progenitors and provide new insights into the molecular and cellular underpinnings of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with maternal infections.

Abstract: Summary
Escherichia coli broadly colonize the intestinal tract of humans and produce a variety of small molecule signals. However, many of these small molecules remain unknown. Here, we describe a family of widely distributed bacterial metabolites termed the “indolokines.” In E. coli, the indolokines are upregulated in response to a redox stressor via aspC and tyrB transaminases. Although indolokine 1 represents a previously unreported metabolite, four of the indolokines (2–5) were previously shown to be derived from indole-3-carbonyl nitrile (ICN) in the plant pathogen defense response. We show that the indolokines are produced in a convergent evolutionary manner relative to plants, enhance E. coli persister cell formation, outperform ICN protection in an Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae infection model, trigger a hallmark plant innate immune response, and activate distinct immunological responses in primary human tissues. Our molecular studies link a family of cellular stress-induced metabolites to defensive responses across bacteria, plants, and humans.

Abstract: Introduction
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) are highly attractive for tissue engineering due to their ability to differentiate into different cell types, to expand extensively in vitro and to release paracrine soluble factors with a high regenerative potential. They were observed to migrate towards the sites of injury in response to chemotactic signals in vivo. During the last years hypoxia has become a proven method to control proliferation, differentiation and multipotency of BMSC. Conditioned medium from hypoxia-treated BMSC (Hypoxia-conditioned Medium; HCM) has been shown to have various favorable properties on tissue regeneration – such as on cell recruitment, wound healing, angiogenesis and revascularization. Due to this regenerative potential many studies attempt to further characterize HCM and its main functional components. In this study we used HCM generated from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) instead of BMSC, because GMP-verified methods were used to isolate and cultivate the cells and ensure their constant quality. UC-MSC have a high regenerative potential and are still immunologically naive and therefore highly unlikely to cause an immune reaction. In our article we took the first steps to closer investigate the role of umbilical cord MSC-derived HCM components, namely stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1α), interleukin 11 (IL-11) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1).
Results
Our results show previously unknown roles of IL-11 and sVCAM-1 in the attraction of BMSC. The synergistic effect of the investigated protein mixture consisting of IL-11, sVCAM-1 and SDF-1α as well as those recombinant proteins alone revealed a significantly higher chemoattractive capacity towards human BMSC compared to normoxic control medium. Both, the protein mixtures and proteins alone as well as UC-HCM showed an angiogenic effect by promoting the formation of significantly longer tubule structures and higher amounts of junctions and tubules compared to normoxic control medium.
Conclusions
By showing the prominent upregulation of IL-11, sVCAM-1 and SDF-1α under hypoxic conditions compared to normoxic control and revealing their crucial role in migration of human BMSC we took a further step forward in characterization of the chemoattractive components of HCM.

Abstract: SNAIL1 is a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor clinical prognosis of cancer patients. Compared to the studies of SNAIL1 stability and its transcriptional regulation, very limited knowledge is available regarding effective approaches to directly target SNAIL1. In this study, we revealed the potential regulation of SNAIL1 gene expression by G-quadruplex structures in its promoter. We first revealed that the negative strand of the SNAIL1 promoter contained a multi-G-tract region with high potential of forming G-quadruplex structures. In circular dichroism studies, the oligonucleotide based on this region showed characteristic molar ellipticity at specific wavelengths of G-quadruplex structures. We also utilized native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel-shift assays, immunofluorescent staining, dimethyl sulfate footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies to verify the G-quadruplex structures formed by the oligonucleotide. In reporter assays, disruption of G-quadruplex potential increased SNAIL1 promoter-mediated transcription, suggesting that G-quadruplexes played a negative role in SNAIL1 expression. In a DNA synthesis study, we detected G-quadruplex-mediated retardation in the SNAIL1 promoter replication. Consistently, we discovered that the G-quadruplex region of the SNAIL1 promoter is highly enriched for mutations, implicating the clinical relevance of G-quadruplexes to the altered SNAIL1 expression in cancer cells.

Abstract: Tripartite motif 16 (TRIM16) has emerged as a novel oxidative stress-responsive protein that confers cytoprotective effects by reinforcing the cellular antioxidant system. However, whether TRIM16 is involved in regulating oxidative stress during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential function and molecular mechanism of TRIM16 in regulating oxidative stress in neurons induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro. Here, we found that OGD/R exposure resulted in a significant induction of TRIM16 expression in neurons. Depletion of TRIM16 by siRNA-mediated gene knockdown markedly upregulated the sensitivity of neurons to OGD/R-induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Notably, upregulation of TRIM16 expression significantly alleviated OGD/R-induced apoptosis and ROS generation in neurons. Moreover, TRIM16 overexpression markedly increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression and enhanced Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) activation associated with downregulation of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) expression. Restoration of Keap1 significantly reversed the TRIM16-mediated promotion effect on Nrf2/ARE activation. In addition, knockdown of Nrf2 also markedly abrogated the TRIM16-conferred neuroprotective effect in OGD/R-exposed neurons. Taken together, our results of our study demonstrate that induction of TRIM16 confers a cytoprotective effect in OGD/R-exposed neurons through enhancement of Nrf2/ARE antioxidant signaling via downregulation of Keap1. These findings suggest that TRIM16 may play a critical role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and serve as a promising target for neuroprotection.

Abstract: Summary
In the absence of a dominant driving mutation other than uniformly present TP53 mutations, deeper understanding of the biology driving ovarian high-grade serous cancer (HGSC) requires analysis at a functional level, including post-translational modifications. Comprehensive proteogenomic and phosphoproteomic characterization of 83 prospectively collected ovarian HGSC and appropriate normal precursor tissue samples (fallopian tube) under strict control of ischemia time reveals pathways that significantly differentiate between HGSC and relevant normal tissues in the context of homologous repair deficiency (HRD) status. In addition to confirming key features of HGSC from previous studies, including a potential survival-associated signature and histone acetylation as a marker of HRD, deep phosphoproteomics provides insights regarding the potential role of proliferation-induced replication stress in promoting the characteristic chromosomal instability of HGSC and suggests potential therapeutic targets for use in precision medicine trials.

Abstract: Here, we report proteome profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-originated, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived, lens-like organoids termed lentoid bodies at two differentiation time points. A small aliquot of the blood sample was ascertained to collect PBMCs that were reprogrammed to iPSCs. The PBMC-originated, iPSCs were differentiated to lentoid bodies employing the “fried egg” method. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed increased expression levels of lens-associated markers in lentoid bodies while transmission electron microscopy identified closely packed lens epithelial- and differentiating fiber-like cells in lentoid bodies. Total cellular protein was extracted from lentoid bodies at differentiation day 25 and mass spectrometry identified a total of 9,473 proteins. The low counts of crystallin proteins at differentiation day 25 prompted us to re-examine the proteome at differentiation day 35 as we reasoned that 10 additional days of differentiation will increase the crystallin count. However, we did not detect any substantial increase in crystallin protein counts at differentiation day 35. In conclusion, we report generation and proteome profiles of PBMC-originated, iPSC-derived lentoid bodies at multiple differentiation time points.

Abstract: Summary
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a barrier for circulating factors, but simultaneously challenges drug delivery. How the BBB is altered in Alzheimer disease (AD) is not fully understood. To facilitate this analysis, we derived brain endothelial cells (iBECs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of several patients carrying the familial AD PSEN1 mutation. We demonstrate that, compared with isogenic PSEN1 corrected and control iBECs, AD-iBECs exhibit altered tight and adherens junction protein expression as well as efflux properties. Furthermore, by applying focused ultrasound (FUS) that transiently opens the BBB and achieves multiple therapeutic effects in AD mouse models, we found an altered permeability to 3–5 kDa dextran as a model cargo and the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in AD-iBECs compared with control iBECs. This presents human-derived in vitro models of the BBB as a valuable tool to understand its role and properties in a disease context, with possible implications for drug delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) may be an important source for regenerative medicine. The low derivation efficiency of stem cells and the accessibility of human oocytes are the main obstacles to their application. We previously reported that the efficiency of SCNT was increased by overexpression of H3K9me3 demethylase. Here, we applied a modified derivation method to the PSC line and first obtained human SCNT-PSC lines derived from both donated cryopreserved oocytes and cord blood cells with a homozygous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. The SCNT-PSCs have very similar characteristics with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and additionally have shown immunocompatibility in an in vitro and in vivo humanized mouse with a matching HLA type. Our study demonstrates that SCNT technology using donated cryopreserved oocytes and cord blood cells with a known HLA type provides a promising method for establishing a human HLA-matched SCNT-PSC bank for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: A positive feedback loop between inflammatory cytokines and alpha1-adrenoceptors (α1-AR) (a target of the sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter norepinephrine) influences inflammatory responses in immune cells. This cross-talk between the sympathetic nervous system and immune system may play a role in promoting chronic inflammation. Emerging evidence shows that α1-AR interact with inflammatory cytokines in keratinocytes, and this epidermal adrenergic signalling may contribute to skin inflammatory responses following injury, disease or stress. In this study, utilizing an in vitro approach, we hypothesized that α1-AR interact in a positive feedback loop with inflammatory mediators in keratinocytes. The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was used to induce an inflammatory state in cultured keratinocytes. TNFα increased interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and nerve growth factor (NGF) production and gene expression levels of α1-AR subtype B (α1B-AR). Additional stimulation of α1-AR further increased IL-6 levels, while maintaining high levels of IL-8 and decreasing levels of IL-1β and NGF. Our results suggest that reciprocal influences between α1-ARs and inflammatory cytokines may play a role in normal inflammatory responses. However, if unchecked, this cycle could contribute to pathology (e.g. chronic inflammatory diseases, chronic pain conditions, and stress-induced cancer progression).

Abstract: Embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs), comprising neuroepithelial and radial glial cells, are indispensable precursors of neurons and glia in the mammalian developing brain. Since the process of neurogenesis occurs in a hypoxic environment, the question arises of how NSCs deal with low oxygen tension and whether it affects their stemness. Genes from the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) family are well known factors governing cellular response to hypoxic conditions. In this study, we have discovered that the endogenous stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) during neural induction is critical for the normal development of the NSCs pool by preventing its premature depletion and differentiation. The knock-out of the Hif1α gene in mESC-derived neurospheres led to a decrease in self-renewal of NSCs, paralleled by an increase in neuronal differentiation. Similarly, neuroepithelial cells differentiated in hypoxia exhibited accelerated neurogenesis soon after Hif1α knock-down. In both models, the loss of Hif1α was accompanied by an immediate drop in neural repressor Hes1 levels while changes in Notch signaling were not observed. We found that active Hif1α/Arnt1 transcription complex bound to the evolutionarily conserved site in Hes1 gene promoter in both neuroepithelial cells and neural tissue of E8.5 – 9.5 embryos. Taken together, these results emphasize the novel role of Hif1α in the regulation of early NSCs population through the activation of neural repressor Hes1, independently of Notch signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Hemagglutinins (HAs) from human influenza viruses adapt to bind α2-6-linked sialosides, overcoming a receptor-defined species barrier distinct from the α2-3 specificity of avian virus progenitors. Additionally, human-adapted HAs gain glycosylation sites over time, although their biological function is poorly defined. Using quantitative glycomic analysis, we show that HAs from human pandemic viruses exhibit significant proportions of high-mannose type N-linked glycans throughout the head domain. By contrast, poorly adapted avian-origin HAs contain predominately complex-type glycans, which have greater structural diversity. Although oligomannose levels vary, they are present in all tested recombinant HAs and whole viruses and can be specifically targeted for universal detection. The positions of high-mannose glycosites on the HA of human H1N1 and H3N2 strains are conserved. Additionally, high-mannose-binding lectins possess a broad capacity to neutralize and prevent infection with contemporary H3N2 strains. These findings reveal the biological significance of HA glycosylation and therapeutic potential of targeting these structures.

Abstract: Summary
Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is a paradigm shift for small-molecule drug discovery. However, limited E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands with cellular activity are available. In vitro binding assays involve the expression and purification of a large amount of proteins and they often yield ligands that are inactive in cell-based assays due to poor cell permeability, stability, and other reasons. Herein, we report the development of a practical and efficient cell-based target engagement assay to evaluate the binding affinity of a small library of cereblon ligands to its E3 ligase in cells. Selected cell-permeable E3 ligase ligands derived from this assay are then used to construct HDAC6 degraders with cellular protein degradation activity. Because the assay does not involve any genetic engineering, it is relatively easy to transfer from one cell type to a different one.

Abstract: Summary
The live-attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV or Sabin vaccine) replicates in gut-associated tissues, eliciting mucosa and systemic immunity. OPV protects from disease and limits poliovirus spread. Accordingly, vaccination with OPV is the primary strategy used to end the circulation of all polioviruses. However, the ability of OPV to regain replication fitness and establish new epidemics represents a significant risk of polio re-emergence should immunization cease. Here, we report the development of a poliovirus type 2 vaccine strain (nOPV2) that is genetically more stable and less likely to regain virulence than the original Sabin2 strain. We introduced modifications within at the 5′ untranslated region of the Sabin2 genome to stabilize attenuation determinants, 2C coding region to prevent recombination, and 3D polymerase to limit viral adaptability. Prior work established that nOPV2 is immunogenic in preclinical and clinical studies, and thus may enable complete poliovirus eradication.

Abstract: The susceptibility to neurological and psychiatric disorders reveals sexual dimorphism in the structure and function of human brains. Recent evidence has also demonstrated the sex-related differences in cellular components of the brain, including neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) regulate the neuronal system in various ways and play crucial roles in brain homeostasis beyond their well-known role as a reservoir for mature oligodendrocytes. Although recent studies have shown regional diversities and heterogeneities of OPCs, sex-related differences in OPCs are largely unknown. Here, we revealed transcriptomic differences in OPCs isolated from male and female neonatal rat brains. Furthermore, we demonstrated sex-dependent differences in OPCs regarding proliferation, migration, differentiation, tolerance against ischemic stress, energy metabolism, and the ability to regulate the blood–brain barrier integrity.

Abstract: The development of Portunus trituberculatus egg cells is directly related to the nutritional status of the fertilized egg, which affects the key production stages of offspring hatching. Vitellogenin plays a key role in the nutrient supply required for the development of the egg cells. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is an important member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily and plays an important role in cell proliferation, transformation, differentiation, and apoptosis. At present, there are no reports on the involvement of the JNK signaling pathway in the reproductive regulation of P. trituberculatus. In this study, rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends amplification technology was used to clone the full length of JNK complementary DNA, which has a length of 2094 bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 1266 bp encoding a 421-amino acid protein. The protein includes the S_TKC conserved domain with a TPY phosphorylation site, which is a typical feature of the JNK gene family. Observing tissue sections found the oocytes in the inhibitor group developed slowly, while the oocytes in the activated group showed accelerated development. Meanwhile, Portunus trituberculatus JNK and vitellogenin (Vg) genes exhibited the same trend in the hepatopancreas and ovaries, and the expression of the SP600125 group was downregulated (P < 0.05), while the anisomycin group was upregulated (P < 0.05). In addition, JNK enzyme activity and vitellin (Vn) content in the ovarian tissue showed that the JNK activity of the SP600125 group decreased, while activity increased in the anisomycin group. The accumulation of Vn content in the SP600125 group decreased, and that in the anisomycin group increased. In summary, after injection with inhibitor or activator, the JNK signaling pathway of P. trituberculatus was inhibited or activated, the accumulation of Vn in the ovary was reduced or increased, and ovarian development was inhibited or accelerated, respectively. These results indicated that the JNK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of Vg synthesis and ovarian development in P. trituberculatus. The results of this study further add to the knowledge of the breeding biology of P. trituberculatus and provide a theoretical reference for the optimization of breeding techniques in aquaculture production systems.

Abstract: Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2), a glycoprotein that regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis during mineral metabolism, appears to display multiple roles in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. This study aimed to access the prognostic value of STC2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its implications in oral tumorigenesis. STC2 expression was examined in 2 independent cohorts of OSCC tissues by immunohistochemistry. A loss-of-function strategy using shRNA targeting STC2 was employed to investigate STC2 in vitro effects on proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and possible activation of signaling pathways. Moreover, STC2 effects were assessed in vivo in a xenograft mouse cancer model. High expression of STC2 was significantly associated with poor disease-specific survival (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.37–5.21, p = 0.001) and high rate of recurrence with a hazard ratio of 2.80 (95% CI: 1.07–5.71, p = 0.03). In vitro downregulation of STC2 expression in OSCC cells attenuated proliferation, migration and invasiveness while increased apoptotic rates. In addition, the STC2 downregulation controlled EMT phenotype of OSCC cells, with regulation on E-cadherin, vimentin, Snail1, Twist and Zeb2. The reactivation of STC2 was observed in the STC2 knockdown cells in the in vivo xenograft model, and no influence on tumor growth was observed. Modulation of STC2 expression levels did not alter consistently the phosphorylation status of CREB, ERK, JNK, p38, p70 S6K, STAT3, STAT5A/B and AKT. Our findings suggest that STC2 overexpression is an independent marker of OSCC outcome and may contribute to tumor progression via regulation of proliferation, survival and invasiveness of OSCC cells.

Abstract: Expression of the homeodomain transcription factor HOXB13 has been demonstrated in several malignancies but its role in tumorigenesis remains elusive. We observed high levels of HOXB13 in poorly differentiated pediatric tumors including a highly aggressive childhood neoplasm - malignant rhabdoid tumor. In a xenograft model of rhabdoid tumor, knockout of HOXB13 diminished tumor growth while partial knockdown of HOXB13 promoted differentiation of tumor cells into bone. These results suggest that HOXB13 enhances rhabdoid malignancy by interfering with mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of HOXB13 in mesenchymal progenitor cells inhibited adipogenic, myogenic, and osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that HOXB13 binds to super-enhancer regions regulating genes involved in differentiation and tumorigenesis.

It is currently unclear whether co-occurring oncogenic alterations might influence this synthetic lethality by conferring more or less potency in the killing of tumor cells. To identify such modifiers, isogenic cell lines were utilized to test a variety of cancer genes that have been previously demonstrated to promote survival under conditions of cellular stress, contribute to chemoresistance and/or suppress MYC-primed apoptosis. It was found that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, two antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, can partially suppress the synthetic lethality, but not multinucleation, elicited by a pan-aurora kinase inhibitor, VX-680. Suppression was show to stem from the inhibition of autophagy, specifically in multinucleated cells, rather than a general inhibition of apoptosis. The anti-autophagic activity of Bcl-2 also impacted polyploid cell recovery in colony-forming assays, suggesting a route of escape from MYC-VX-680 synthetic lethality that may have clinical consequences. These findings expand on previous conclusions that autophagic death of VX-680-induced polyploid cells is mediated by Atg6. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL negatively modulate MYC-VX-680 synthetic lethality and it is the anti-autophagic activity of these two Bcl-2 family proteins, specifically in multinucleate cells, that contributes to resistance to Aurora kinase-targeting drugs.

Abstract: The ability of cells to respond to stress is central to health. Stress can damage folded proteins, which are vulnerable to even minor changes in cellular conditions. To maintain proteostasis, cells have developed an intricate network in which molecular chaperones are key players. The small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) are a widespread family of molecular chaperones, and some sHSPs are prominent in muscle, where cells and proteins must withstand high levels of applied force. sHSPs have long been thought to act as general interceptors of protein aggregation. However, evidence is accumulating that points to a more specific role for sHSPs in protecting proteins from mechanical stress. Here, we briefly introduce the sHSPs and outline the evidence for their role in responses to mechanical stress. We suggest that sHSPs interact with mechanosensitive proteins to regulate physiological extension and contraction cycles. It is likely that further study of these interactions – enabled by the development of experimental methodologies that allow protein contacts to be studied under the application of mechanical force – will expand our understanding of the activity and functions of sHSPs, and of the roles played by chaperones in general.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited late-onset neurological disorder characterized by progressive neuronal loss and disruption of cortical and basal ganglia circuits. Cell replacement using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 ± 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron. We have also shown that transplants elicited a significant improvement in sensory-motor tasks up to 2 months post-transplant further supporting the therapeutic potential of this approach.

Abstract: Docetaxel-based chemotherapy is recommended for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, chemoresistance is inevitable and eventually progresses after several rounds of chemotherapy. Therefore, exploration of new therapeutic targets and molecular mechanisms that contribute to chemoresistance remains necessary. Our previous study accidentally demonstrated that expression of nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2), which is defined as a tumor suppressor, is upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) and linked to poor prognosis, particularly in CRPC. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NPRL2 in the chemoresistant CRPC cells. We found that NPRL2 was significantly overexpressed in docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells, while autophagy was enhanced and mTOR signaling was inhibited. Inhibiting NPRL2 increased the sensitivity to docetaxel in docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells, enhanced apoptosis and inhibited autophagy, and the opposite trends were observed when the mTOR inhibitor torin 1 was added to NPRL2-silenced cells. We further found that NPRL2 silenced docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells were sensitive to docetaxel in vivo. Briefly, our research reveals that overexpression of NPRL2 promotes chemoresistance by regulating autophagy via mTOR signaling and inhibits apoptosis in CRPC cells.

Abstract: Summary
Destabilizing domains (DDs), such as a mutated form of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR), confer instability and promote protein degradation. However, when combined with small-molecule stabilizers (e.g., the antibiotic trimethoprim), DDs allow positive regulation of fusion protein abundance. Using a combinatorial screening approach, we identified and validated 17 unique 2,4-diaminopyrimidine/triazine-based ecDHFR DD stabilizers, at least 15 of which were ineffective antibiotics against E. coli and S. aureus. Identified stabilizers functioned in vivo to control an ecDHFR DD-firefly luciferase in the mouse eye and/or the liver. Next, stabilizers were leveraged to perform synergistic dual functions in vitro (HeLa cell death sensitization) and in vivo (repression of ocular inflammation) by stabilizing a user-defined ecDHFR DD while also controlling endogenous signaling pathways. Thus, these newly identified pharmacological chaperones allow for simultaneous control of compound-specific endogenous and user-defined genetic pathways, the combination of which may provide synergistic effects in complex biological scenarios.
