Abstract: Summary
Imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of Bcr-Abl1+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but, in most patients, some leukemia cells persist despite continued therapy, while others become resistant. Here, we report that PlGF levels are elevated in CML and that PlGF produced by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) aggravates disease severity. CML cells foster a soil for their own growth by inducing BMSCs to upregulate PlGF, which not only stimulates BM angiogenesis, but also promotes CML proliferation and metabolism, in part independently of Bcr-Abl1 signaling. Anti-PlGF treatment prolongs survival of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML mice and adds to the anti-CML activity of imatinib. These results may warrant further investigation of the therapeutic potential of PlGF inhibition for (imatinib-resistant) CML.

Abstract: Summary
Rosiglitazone is a PPARγ agonist commonly used to treat diabetes. In addition to improving insulin sensitivity, rosiglitazone restores normal vascular function by a mechanism that remains poorly understood. Here we show that adiponectin is required to mediate the PPARγ effect on vascular endothelium of diabetic mice. In db/db and diet-induced obese mice, PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone restores endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortae, whereas diabetic mice lacking adiponectin or treated with an anti-adiponectin antibody do not respond. Rosiglitazone stimulates adiponectin release from fat explants, and subcutaneous fat transplantation from rosiglitazone-treated mice recapitulates vasodilatation in untreated db/db recipients. Mechanistically, adiponectin activates AMPK/eNOS and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways in aortae, which increase NO bioavailability and reduce oxidative stress. Taken together, these results demonstrate that adipocyte-derived adiponectin is required for PPARγ-mediated improvement of endothelial function in diabetes. Thus, the adipose tissue represents a promising target for treating diabetic vasculopathy.

ADF/Cofilin Regulates Secretory Cargo Sorting at the TGN via the Ca2+ ATPase SPCA1,

Abstract: Summary
Actin-severing proteins ADF/cofilin are required for the sorting of secretory cargo at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in mammalian cells. How do these cytoplasmic proteins interact with the cargoes in the lumen of the TGN? Put simply, how are these two sets of proteins connected across the TGN membrane? Mass spectrometry of cofilin1 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells revealed the presence of actin and the Ca2+ ATPase SPCA1. Moreover, cofilin1 was localized to the TGN and bound to SPCA1 via dynamic actin. SPCA1 knockdown, like ADF/cofilin1 knockdown, inhibited Ca2+ uptake into the TGN and caused missorting of secretory cargo. These defects were rescued by the overexpression of the TGN-localized SPCA1. We propose that ADF/cofilin-dependent severing of actin filaments exposes and promotes the activation of SPCA1, which pumps Ca2+ into the lumen of the TGN for the sorting of the class of secretory cargo that binds Ca2+.

Abstract: Female adults of the bagworm moth, Eumeta variegata, lack wings completely, whereas male adults of this species have functional wings. We previously found that ecdysteroid induces apoptotic events in the female wing rudiment of E. variegata in vitro, whereas the male wing discs cultured with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) underwent apolysis and then cell differentiation. To investigate whether juvenile hormone (JH) in involved in sex-specific cellular response to ecdysteroid during wing development between sexes of E. variegata, we tested the effects of juvenile hormone analog (JHA), methoprene, and 20E on wing disc morphogenesis between sexes in vitro. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that both higher concentration of JHA (5μg/ml) and 20E (1μg/ml) addition induced cell death (apoptosis) in the male wing discs but not induced cell death in the female wing rudiments in vitro in E. variegata. These culture experiments clearly detected the differential responses of wing discs to JHA under ecdysteroid treatment between sexes. We propose two important hypotheses: (1) JH is not significantly involved in the suppression of the female wing rudiment morphogenesis under 20E treatment, (2) female wing rudiment has lost the ability for cell proliferation in response to the stimulus of 20E.

Abstract: Summary
Cell cycle progression requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), which uses the substrate adaptors CDC20 and CDH1 to target proteins for proteasomal degradation. The APCCDH1 substrate cyclin A is critical for the G1/S transition and, paradoxically, accumulates even when APCCDH1 is active. We show that the deubiquitinase USP37 binds CDH1 and removes degradative polyubiquitin from cyclin A. USP37 was induced by E2F transcription factors in G1, peaked at G1/S, and was degraded in late mitosis. Phosphorylation of USP37 by CDK2 stimulated its full activity. USP37 overexpression caused premature cyclin A accumulation in G1 and accelerated S phase entry, whereas USP37 knockdown delayed these events. USP37 was inactive in mitosis because it was no longer phosphorylated by CDK2. Indeed, it switched from an antagonist to a substrate of APCCDH1 and was modified with degradative K11-linked polyubiquitin.

Abstract: Summary
Polyphosphoinositides are lipid signaling molecules generated from phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) with critical roles in vesicular trafficking and signaling. It is poorly understood where PtdIns is located within cells and how it moves around between membranes. Here we identify a hitherto-unrecognized highly mobile membrane compartment as the site of PtdIns synthesis and a likely source of PtdIns of all membranes. We show that the PtdIns-synthesizing enzyme PIS associates with a rapidly moving compartment of ER origin that makes ample contacts with other membranes. In contrast, CDP-diacylglycerol synthases that provide PIS with its substrate reside in the tubular ER. Expression of a PtdIns-specific bacterial PLC generates diacylglycerol also in rapidly moving cytoplasmic objects. We propose a model in which PtdIns is synthesized in a highly mobile lipid distribution platform and is delivered to other membranes during multiple contacts by yet-to-be-defined lipid transfer mechanisms.

Abstract: The Octamer 4 gene (Oct4) is a master pluripotency controller that has been detected in several types of tumors. Here, we examine the expression of Oct4 in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We found that punctate Oct4 protein was expressed in most (93.7%) ESCC samples but it was not observed in esophageal mucosa. Some ESCC cells had the capacity to form tumorospheres; those with an Oct4+-rich cell phenotype had increased proliferation and Oct4 mRNA levels compared to those of differentiated cells in culture or xenograft tumors. The over-expression of Oct4 in ESCCs suggests that it is a potential target for ESCC therapy. Oct4 could be a useful tumor marker in an immunohistochemical panel designed to differentiate between ESCC and esophageal mucosa. Expression of Oct4 in tumorospheres might indicate the presence of a population of ECSCs and its expression in xenograft tumors suggests that Oct4 is also associated with tumor metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Bistability of the Cdk1-Wee1-Cdc25 mitotic control network underlies the switch-like transitions between interphase and mitosis. Here, we show by mathematical modeling and experiments in Xenopus egg extracts that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which can dephosphorylate Cdk1 substrates, is essential for this bistability. PP2A inhibition in early interphase abolishes the switch-like response of the system to Cdk1 activity, promoting mitotic onset even with very low levels of Cyclin, Cdk1, and Cdc25, while simultaneously inhibiting DNA replication. Furthermore, even if replication has already initiated, it cannot continue in mitosis. Exclusivity of S and M phases does not depend on bistability only, since partial PP2A inhibition prevents replication without inducing mitotic onset. In these conditions, interphase-level mitotic kinases inhibit Cyclin E-Cdk2 chromatin loading, blocking initiation complex formation. Therefore, by counteracting both Cdk1 activation and activity of mitotic kinases, PP2A ensures robust separation of S phase and mitosis and dynamic transitions between the two states.

Abstract: Low temperature is one of the major environmental stresses in rice cultivation in high-altitude and high-latitude regions. In this study, we cultivated a set of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from Dasanbyeo (indica) / TR22183 (japonica) crosses in Yanji (high-latitude area), Kunming (high-altitude area), Chuncheon (cold water irrigation) and Suwon (normal) to evaluate the main effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and epistatic QTL (E-QTL) with regard to their interactions with environments for cold-related traits. Six QTLs for spikelet fertility (SF) were identified in three cold treatment locations. Among them, four QTLs on chromosomes 2, 7, 8, and 10 were validated by several near isogenic lines (NILs) under cold treatment in Chuncheon. A total of 57 QTLs and 76 E-QTLs for nine cold-related traits were identified as distributing on all 12 chromosomes; among them, 19 QTLs and E-QTLs showed significant interactions of QTLs and environments (QEIs). The total phenotypic variation explained by each trait ranged from 13.2 to 29.1% in QTLs, 10.6 to 29.0% in E-QTLs, 2.2 to 8.8% in QEIs and 1.0% to 7.7% in E-QTL × environment interactions (E-QEIs). These results demonstrate that epistatic effects and QEIs are important properties of QTL parameters for cold tolerance at the reproductive stage. In order to develop cold tolerant varieties adaptable to wide-ranges of cold stress, a strategy facilitating marker-assisted selection (MAS) is being adopted to accumulate QTLs identified from different environments.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute (AGO) proteins are critical components of RNA silencing pathways that bind small RNAs and mediate gene silencing at their target sites. We found that Arabidopsis AGO2 is highly induced by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). Further genetic analysis demonstrated that AGO2 functions in antibacterial immunity. One abundant species of AGO2-bound small RNA is miR393b∗, which targets a Golgi-localized SNARE gene, MEMB12. Pst infection downregulates MEMB12 in a miR393b∗-dependent manner. Loss of function of MEMB12, but not SYP61, another intracellular SNARE, leads to increased exocytosis of an antimicrobial pathogenesis-related protein, PR1. Overexpression of miR393b∗ resembles memb12 mutant in resistance responses. Thus, AGO2 functions in antibacterial immunity by binding miR393b∗ to modulate exocytosis of antimicrobial PR proteins via MEMB12. Since miR393 also contributes to antibacterial responses, miR393∗/miR393 represent an example of a miRNA∗/miRNA pair that functions in immunity through two distinct AGOs: miR393∗ through AGO2 and miR393 through AGO1.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular antioxidant enzymes play crucial roles in aerobic organisms by eliminating detrimental oxidants and maintaining the intracellular redox homeostasis. Therefore, the function of antioxidant enzymes is inextricably linked to the redox-dependent activities of multiple proteins and signaling pathways. Here, we report that the VEGFR2 RTK has an oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue whose reduced state is preserved specifically by peroxiredoxin II (PrxII) in vascular endothelial cells. In the absence of PrxII, the cellular H2O2 level is markedly increased and the VEGFR2 becomes inactive, no longer responding to VEGF stimulation. Such VEGFR2 inactivation is due to the formation of intramolecular disulfide linkage between Cys1199 and Cys1206 in the C-terminal tail. Interestingly, the PrxII-mediated VEGFR2 protection is achieved by association of two proteins in the caveolae. Furthermore, PrxII deficiency suppresses tumor angiogenesis in vivo. This study thus demonstrates a physiological function of PrxII as the residential antioxidant safeguard specific to the redox-sensitive VEGFR2.

Abstract: Summary
Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been implicated in control of energy balance, but the physiological importance of NPY in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) remains unclear. Here we report that knockdown of NPY expression in the DMH by adeno-associated virus-mediated RNAi reduced fat depots in rats fed regular chow and ameliorated high-fat diet-induced hyperphagia and obesity. DMH NPY knockdown resulted in development of brown adipocytes in inguinal white adipose tissue through the sympathetic nervous system. This knockdown increased uncoupling protein 1 expression in both inguinal fat and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT). Consistent with the activation of BAT, DMH NPY knockdown increased energy expenditure and enhanced the thermogenic response to a cold environment. This knockdown also increased locomotor activity, improved glucose homeostasis, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Together, these results demonstrate critical roles of DMH NPY in body weight regulation through affecting food intake, body adiposity, thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and physical activity.

Abstract: Summary
The decision by a cell to enter a round of growth and division must be intimately coordinated with nutrient availability and its metabolic state. These metabolic and nutritional requirements, and the mechanisms by which they induce cell growth and proliferation, remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that acetyl-CoA is the downstream metabolite of carbon sources that represents a critical metabolic signal for growth and proliferation. Upon entry into growth, intracellular acetyl-CoA levels increase substantially and consequently induce the Gcn5p/SAGA-catalyzed acetylation of histones at genes important for growth, thereby enabling their rapid transcription and commitment to growth. Thus, acetyl-CoA functions as a carbon-source rheostat that signals the initiation of the cellular growth program by promoting the acetylation of histones specifically at growth genes.

Abstract: Summary
Caspase-2 is an evolutionarily conserved caspase, yet its biological function and cleavage targets are poorly understood. Caspase-2 is activated by the p53 target gene product PIDD (also known as LRDD) in a complex called the Caspase-2-PIDDosome. We show that PIDD expression promotes growth arrest and chemotherapy resistance by a mechanism that depends on Caspase-2 and wild-type p53. PIDD-induced Caspase-2 directly cleaves the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 at Asp 367, leading to loss of the C-terminal RING domain responsible for p53 ubiquitination. As a consequence, N-terminally truncated Mdm2 binds p53 and promotes its stability. Upon DNA damage, p53 induction of the Caspase-2-PIDDosome creates a positive feedback loop that inhibits Mdm2 and reinforces p53 stability and activity, contributing to cell survival and drug resistance. These data establish Mdm2 as a cleavage target of Caspase-2 and provide insight into a mechanism of Mdm2 inhibition that impacts p53 dynamics upon genotoxic stress.

Abstract: Summary
53BP1 is a DNA damage protein that forms phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) dependent foci in a 1 Mb region surrounding DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In addition, 53BP1 promotes genomic stability by regulating the metabolism of DNA ends. We have compared the joining rates of paired DSBs separated by 1.2 kb to 27 Mb on chromosome 12 in the presence or absence of 53BP1. 53BP1 facilitates joining of intrachromosomal DSBs but only at distances corresponding to γ-H2AX spreading. In contrast, DNA end protection by 53BP1 is distance independent. Furthermore, analysis of 53BP1 mutants shows that chromatin association, oligomerization, and N-terminal ATM phosphorylation are all required for DNA end protection and joining as measured by immunoglobulin class switch recombination. These data elucidate the molecular events that are required for 53BP1 to maintain genomic stability and point to a model wherein 53BP1 and H2AX cooperate to repress resection of DSBs.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinating the balance between progenitor self-renewal and myogenic differentiation is required for a regulated expansion of the developing muscles. Previous observation that neural crest cells (NCCs) migrate throughout the somite regions, where trunk skeletal muscles first emerge, suggests a potential role for these cells in influencing early muscle formation. However, specific signaling interactions between NCCs and skeletal muscle cells remain unknown. Here we show that mice with specific NCC and peripheral nervous system defects display impaired survival of skeletal muscle and show skeletal muscle progenitor cell (MPC) depletion due to precocious commitment to differentiation. We show that reduced NCC-derived Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) in the somite region perturbs ErbB3 signaling in uncommitted MPCs. Using a combination of explant culture experiments and genetic ablation in the mouse, we demonstrate that Nrg1 signals provided by the NCC lineage play a critical role in sustainable myogenesis, by restraining MPCs from precocious differentiation.

Abstract: For studying cellular processes three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models are of a high importance. For tissue engineering approaches osseous differentiation is performed on 3D scaffolds, but material depending influences promote cellular processes like adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. To investigate developmental processes of mesenchymal stem cells without cell–substrate interactions, self-contained in vitro models mimicking physiological condition are required. However, with respect to scientific investigations and pharmaceutical tests, it is essential that these tissue models are well characterised and are of a high reproducibility. In order to establish an appropriate in vitro model for bone formation, different protocols are compared and optimised regarding their aggregate formation efficiency, homogeneity of the aggregates, the viability and their ability to induce differentiation into the osteogenic lineage. The protocols for the generation of 3D cell models are based on rotation culture, hanging drop technique, and the cultivation in non adhesive culture vessels (single vessels as well as 96 well plates). To conclude, the cultivation of hMSCs in 96 well non adhesive plates facilitates an easy way to cultivate homogenous cellular aggregates with high performance efficiency in parallel. The size can be controlled by the initial cell density per well and within this spheroids, bone formation has been induced.

Abstract: Notch signaling involves the proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane Notch receptor after binding to its transmembrane ligands. The Delta-like ligand 1 also undergoes proteolytic cleavage upon Notch binding, resulting in the production of a free intracellular domain. In this study, we have demonstrated that the Delta-like 1 intracellular domain (Dll1-IC) specifically binds to Notch1-IC in the nucleus, thereby disrupting the association of the Notch1-IC-RBP-Jk-MAM transcription activator complex. Additionally, the Notch1-mediated blockage of the induction of MyoD is abolished by the co-expression of Dll1-IC. Collectively, our results show that Dll1-IC functions as a negative regulator in Notch signaling via the disruption of the Notch1-IC-RBP-Jk complex.

The levels of VIM promoter methylation and VIM gene expression were investigated in 7 cervical cancer cell lines and 50 human tissue samples with a distinctive degree of malignant trans-formation. While multiple CpG sites in the VIM promoter were highly methylated in CIN III and invasive carcinoma cells, they were rarely methylated in normal cells. Our result shows that methylation in the VIM promoter appears to start from CIN I and CIN II, relatively early stages of multistep carcinogenesis. This epigenetic alteration in VIM promoter suggests the availability as a biomarker for the early diagnosis and prevention of cervical cancer. We also show that hypermethylation in the VIM promoter is responsible for transcriptional silencing of the VIM gene in cervical cancer cells. In addition, our result shows that exogenous overexpression of the VIM gene in SiHa cervical cancer cells slightly activated cell proliferation and migration as shown in soft agar colony formation and migration assays.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in gene expression are thought to be important for morphological evolution, though little is known about the nature or magnitude of the differences. Here, we examine Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis, two amphibians with very similar development, and ask how their transcriptomes compare. Despite separation for ∼30–90 million years, there is strong conservation in gene expression in the vast majority of the expressed orthologs. Significant changes occur in the level of gene expression but changes in the timing of expression (heterochrony) were much less common. Differences in level were concentrated in the earliest embryonic stages. Changes in timing were prominently found in pathways that respond to selective features of the environment. We propose that different evolutionary rates across developmental stages may be explained by the stabilization of cell fate determination in the later stages.

Abstract: Summary
The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is a master checkpoint regulator safeguarding the genome. Upon DNA damage, the ATR-ATRIP complex is recruited to sites of DNA damage by RPA-coated single-stranded DNA and activated by an elusive process. Here, we show that ATR is transformed into a hyperphosphorylated state after DNA damage, and that a single autophosphorylation event at Thr 1989 is crucial for ATR activation. Phosphorylation of Thr 1989 relies on RPA, ATRIP, and ATR kinase activity, but unexpectedly not on the ATR stimulator TopBP1. Recruitment of ATR-ATRIP to RPA-ssDNA leads to congregation of ATR-ATRIP complexes and promotes Thr 1989 phosphorylation in trans. Phosphorylated Thr 1989 is directly recognized by TopBP1 via the BRCT domains 7 and 8, enabling TopBP1 to engage ATR-ATRIP, to stimulate the ATR kinase, and to facilitate ATR substrate recognition. Thus, ATR autophosphorylation on RPA-ssDNA is a molecular switch to launch robust checkpoint response.

Abstract: Interferon-α (IFN-α) inhibits the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vivo and in vitro, but the molecular mechanism of this inhibition has been elusive. We found that while HBV replication in transfected human hepatoma Huh-7 cell was severely inhibited by IFN-α treatment as reported previously, this inhibition was markedly impaired in the cell in which the expression of IFN-inducible, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) was stably and specifically suppressed through RNA-interference. Intracellular level of viral capsids was down-regulated likewise in a PKR-dependent manner, whereas that of HBV transcripts including the viral RNA pregenome was not affected by IFN-α treatment. Ectopic expression of PKR also resulted in the reduction of viral capsids with concomitant increase of phosphorylated eIF2α. These results suggested that PKR functions as a key mediator of IFN-α in opposing HBV replication, most likely through the inhibition of protein synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Demethylation by the AlkB dioxygenases represents an important mechanism for repair of N-alkylated nucleotides. However, little is known about their functions in mammalian cells. We report the purification of the ALKBH3 complex and demonstrate its association with the activating signal cointegrator complex (ASCC). ALKBH3 is overexpressed in various cancers, and both ALKBH3 and ASCC are important for alkylation damage resistance in these tumor cell lines. ASCC3, the largest subunit of ASCC, encodes a 3′-5′ DNA helicase, whose activity is crucial for the generation of single-stranded DNA upon which ALKBH3 preferentially functions for dealkylation. In cell lines that are dependent on ALKBH3 and ASCC3 for alkylation damage resistance, loss of ALKBH3 or ASCC3 leads to increased 3-methylcytosine and reduced cell proliferation, which correlates with pH2A.X and 53BP1 foci formation. Our data provide a molecular mechanism by which ALKBH3 collaborates with ASCC to maintain genomic integrity in a cell-type specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
The white-collar complex (WCC), the core transcription factor of the circadian clock of Neurospora, activates morning-specific expression of the transcription repressor CSP1. Newly synthesized CSP1 exists in a transient complex with the corepressor RCM1/RCO1 and the ubiquitin ligase UBR1. CSP1 is rapidly hyperphosphorylated and degraded via UBR1 and its ubiquitin conjugase RAD6. Genes controlled by CSP1 are rhythmically expressed and peak in the evening (i.e., in antiphase to morning-specific genes directly controlled by WCC). Rhythmic expression of these second-tier genes depends crucially on phosphorylation and rapid turnover of CSP1, which ensures tight coupling of CSP1 abundance and function to the circadian activity of WCC. Negative feedback of CSP1 on its own transcription buffers the amplitude of CSP1-dependent oscillations against fluctuations of WCC activity. CSP1 predominantly regulates genes involved in metabolism. It controls ergosterol synthesis and fatty acid desaturases and thereby modulates the lipid composition of membranes.

A Possible Role for FRM-1, a C. elegans FERM Family Protein, in Embryonic Development,

Abstract: FRM-1 is a member of the FERM protein superfamily containing a FERM domain, which is a highly conserved protein-protein interaction module found in most eukaryotes. Although FRM-1 is thought to be involved in linking intra-cellular proteins to membrane proteins, the specific role for FRM-1 remains to be elucidated. In an effort to explore the biological function of FRM-1, we examined the pheno-type of frm-1(tm4168) mutant worms. We observed that frm-1(tm4168) worms have a delayed hatching phenotype. Twelve hours after being laid, when virtually all wild-type eggs had hatched, only 64% of frm-1(tm4168) eggs had hatched. About 3% of frm-1(tm4168) eggs failed to hatch, even 3 days after they had been laid. We also found that frm-1(tm4168) mutants displayed a temperature-sensitive sterility phenotype. About 13% of frm-1(tm4168) worms were unable to produce eggs or produced nonviable eggs at 25°C. In contrast, less than 1% of wild-type animals were sterile at this temperature. At 20°C, neither the mutant nor wild type appeared to be sterile. Western blot analysis indicates that FRM-1 is expressed throughout the developmental stages with the strongest expression at the egg stage. Immunostaining experiments revealed that FRM-1 is mainly localized to the plasma membrane of most if not all cells at an early embryonic stage and to the plasma membrane of P cells during the late embryonic stages. GFP fusion experiments showed that FRM-1 can be expressed in the pharynx and intestine at the larval and adult stages. Our data suggest that FRM-1 may participate in diverse biological processes, including embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian polynucleotide kinase 3′ phosphatase (PNK) plays a key role in the repair of DNA damage, functioning as part of both the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and base excision repair (BER) pathways. Through its two catalytic activities, PNK ensures that DNA termini are compatible with extension and ligation by either removing 3′-phosphates from, or by phosphorylating 5′-hydroxyl groups on, the ribose sugar of the DNA backbone. We have now determined crystal structures of murine PNK with DNA molecules bound to both of its active sites. The structure of ssDNA engaged with the 3′-phosphatase domain suggests a mechanism of substrate interaction that assists DNA end seeking. The structure of dsDNA bound to the 5′-kinase domain reveals a mechanism of DNA bending that facilitates recognition of DNA ends in the context of single-strand and double-strand breaks and suggests a close functional cooperation in substrate recognition between the kinase and phosphatase active sites.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular regulation of cell death pathways by cIAPs has been enigmatic. Here we show that loss of cIAPs promotes the spontaneous formation of an intracellular platform that activates either apoptosis or necroptosis. This 2 MDa intracellular complex that we designate “Ripoptosome” is necessary but not sufficient for cell death. It contains RIP1, FADD, caspase-8, caspase-10, and caspase inhibitor cFLIP isoforms. cFLIPL prevents Ripoptosome formation, whereas, intriguingly, cFLIPS promotes Ripoptosome assembly. When cIAPs are absent, caspase activity is the “rheostat” that is controlled by cFLIP isoforms in the Ripoptosome and decides if cell death occurs by RIP3-dependent necroptosis or caspase-dependent apoptosis. RIP1 is the core component of the complex. As exemplified by our studies for TLR3 activation, our data argue that the Ripoptosome critically influences the outcome of membrane-bound receptor triggering. The differential quality of cell death mediated by the Ripoptosome may cause important pathophysiological consequences during inflammatory responses.

Abstract: Summary
Most tumor cells take up more glucose than normal cells but metabolize glucose via glycolysis even in the presence of normal levels of oxygen, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Tumor cells commonly express the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) that may contribute to the metabolism shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis. Here we show that PKM2 is acetylated on lysine 305 and that this acetylation is stimulated by high glucose concentration. PKM2 K305 acetylation decreases PKM2 enzyme activity and promotes its lysosomal-dependent degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Acetylation increases PKM2 interaction with HSC70, a chaperone for CMA, and association with lysosomes. Ectopic expression of an acetylation mimetic K305Q mutant accumulates glycolytic intermediates and promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth. These results reveal an acetylation regulation of pyruvate kinase and the link between lysine acetylation and CMA.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence and progression are linked tightly to progressive hepatic metabolic syndrome associated with insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and chronic inflammation. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), a major transactivator of stress proteins, increases survival by protecting cells against environmental stressors. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, but specific mechanisms by which HSF1 supports cancer development remain elusive. We propose a pathogenic mechanism whereby HSF1 activation promotes growth of premalignant cells and HCC development by stimulating lipid biosynthesis and perpetuating chronic hepatic metabolic disease induced by carcinogens. Our work shows that inactivation of HSF1 impairs cancer progression, mitigating adverse effects of carcinogens on hepatic metabolism by enhancing insulin sensitivity and sensitizing activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an important regulator of energy homeostasis and inhibitor of lipid synthesis. HSF1 is a potential target for the control of hepatic steatosis, hepatic insulin resistance, and HCC development.

Abstract: Summary
Many molecular pathways involved in heart disease have their roots in evolutionarily ancient developmental programs that depend critically on gene dosage and timing. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene dosage posttranscriptionally, and among these, the muscle-specific miR-1 is particularly important for developing and maintaining somatic/skeletal and cardiac muscle. To identify pathways regulated by miR-1, we performed a forward genetic screen in Drosophila using wing-vein patterning as a biological assay. We identified several unexpected genes that genetically interacted with dmiR-1, one of which was kayak, encodes a developmentally regulated transcription factor. Additional studies directed at this genetic relationship revealed a previously unappreciated function of dmiR-1 in regulating the polarity of cardiac progenitor cells. The mammalian ortholog of kayak, c-Fos, was dysregulated in hearts of gain- or loss-of-function miR-1 mutant mice in a stress-dependent manner. These findings illustrate the power of Drosophila-based screens to find points of intersection between miRNAs and conserved pathways in mammals.

Abstract: A selected strain of rhizobacterium, Pseudomonas putida strain LSW17S (LSW17S), protects tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Seokwang) from bacterial speck by biotrophic Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (DC3000) and bacterial wilt by necrotrophic Ralstonia solanacearum KACC 10703 (Rs10703). To investigate defense mechanisms induced by LSW17S in tomato plants, transcription patterns of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and H2O2 production were analyzed in plants treated with LSW17S and subsequent pathogen inoculation. LSW17S alone did not induce transcriptions of employed PR genes in leaves and roots. DC3000 challenge following LSW17S triggered rapid transcriptions of PR genes and H2O2 production in leaves and roots. Catalase infiltration with DC3000 attenuated defense-related responses and resistance against DC3000 infection. Despite depriving H2O2 production and PR1b transcription by the same treatment, resistance against Rs10703 infection was not deterred significantly. H2O2 is indispensable for defense signaling and/or mechanisms primed by LSW17S and inhibition of bacterial speck, however, it is not involved in resistance against bacterial wilt.

Abstract: Genotyping of highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) markers is widely used for the genetic identification of individuals in forensic DNA analyses and in paternity disputes. The National DNA Profile Databank recently established by the DNA Identification Act in Korea contains the computerized STR DNA profiles of individuals convicted of crimes. For the establishment of a large autosomal STR loci population database, 1805 samples were obtained at random from Korean individuals and 15 autosomal STR markers were analyzed using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler PCR Amplification kit. For the 15 autosomal STR markers, no deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed. The most informative locus in our data set was the D2S1338 with a discrimination power of 0.9699. The combined matching probability was 1.521 × 10-17. This large STR profile dataset including atypical alleles will be important for the establishment of the Korean DNA database and for forensic applications.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the immunostimulating activity of polysaccharides isolated from fruiting body of Inonotus obliquus (PFIO). Additionally, the signaling pathway of PFIO-mediated macrophage activation was investigated in RAW264.7 macrophage cells. We found that PFIO was capable of promoting NO/ROS production, TNF-α secretion and phagocytic uptake in macrophages, as well as cell proliferation, comitogenic effect and IFN-γ/IL-4 secretion in mouse splenocytes. PFIO was able to induce the phosphorylation of three MAPKs as well as the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, resulting in activation of RAW264.7 macrophages. PFIO also induced the inhibition of TNF-α secretion by anti-TLR2 mAb, consequently, PFIO might be involved in TNF-α secretion via the TLR2 receptor. In addition, our results showed that oral administration of PFIO suppressed in vivo growth of melanoma tumor in tumorbearing mice. In conclusion, our experiments presented that PFIO effectively promotes macrophage activation through the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, suggesting that PFIO may potentially regulate the immune response.

Abstract: ClpP is a cylindrical protease that is tightly regulated by CIp-ATPases. The activation mechanism of ClpP using acyldepsipeptide antibiotics as mimics of natural activators showed enlargement of the axial entrance pore for easier processing of incoming substrates. However, the elimination of degradation products from inside the ClpP chamber remains unclear since there is no exit pore for releasing these products in all determined ClpP structures. Here we report a new crystal structure of ClpP from Bacillus subtilis, which shows a significantly compressed shape along the axial direction. A portion of the handle regions comprising the heptameric ring-ring contacts shows structural transition from an ordered to a disordered state, which triggers the large conformational change from an extended to an overall compressed structure. Along with this structural change, 14 side pores are generated for product release and the catalytic triad adopts an inactive orientation. We have also determined B. subtilis ClpP inhibited by diisopropylfluoro-phosphate and analyzed the active site in detail. Structural information pertaining to several different conformational steps such as those related to extended, ADEP-activated, DFP-inhibited and compressed forms of ClpP from B. subtilis is available. Structural comparisons suggest that functionally important regions in the ClpP-family such as N-terminal segments for the axial pore, catalytic triads, and handle domains for the product releasing pore exhibit intrinsically dynamic and unique structural features. This study provides valuable insights for understanding the enigmatic cylindrical degradation machinery of ClpP as well as other related proteases such as HslV and the 20S proteasome.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent fusions of ETS genes are considered driving mutations in a diverse array of cancers, including Ewing's sarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and prostate cancer. We investigate the mechanisms by which ETS fusions mediate their effects, and find that the product of the predominant ETS gene fusion, TMPRSS2:ERG, interacts in a DNA-independent manner with the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and the catalytic subunit of DNA protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). ETS gene-mediated transcription and cell invasion require PARP1 and DNA-PKcs expression and activity. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 inhibits ETS-positive, but not ETS-negative, prostate cancer xenograft growth. Finally, overexpression of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion induces DNA damage, which is potentiated by PARP1 inhibition in a manner similar to that of BRCA1/2 deficiency.

Abstract: Phosphatidylserine (PS)-exposing platelets accelerate coagulation at sites of vascular injury. PS exposure requires sustained Ca2+ signalling. Two distinct Ca2+ entry pathways amplify and sustain platelet Ca2+ signalling, but their relative importance in human platelets is not known. Here we examined the relative roles of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and non-capacitative Ca2+ entry (NCCE) in thrombin-induced Ca2+ signalling and PS exposure by using two Ca2+ channel blockers. BTP-2 showed marked selectivity for SOCE over NCCE. LOE-908 specifically blocked NCCE under our conditions. Using these agents we found that SOCE is important at low thrombin concentrations whereas NCCE became increasingly important as thrombin concentration was increased. PS exposure was reduced by LOE-908, and only activated at thrombin concentrations that also activate NCCE. In contrast, BTP-2 had no effect on PS exposure. We suggest that SOCE amplifies and sustains Ca2+ signalling in response to low concentrations of thrombin whereas both NCCE and SOCE are important contributors to Ca2+ signalling at higher thrombin concentrations. However, despite being involved in Ca2+ signalling at high thrombin concentrations, SOCE is not important for thrombin-induced PS exposure in human platelets. This suggests that the route of Ca2+ entry is an important regulator of thrombin-induced PS exposure in platelets.

Abstract: Summary
The autonomic nervous system regulates hormone secretion from the endocrine pancreas, the islets of Langerhans, thus impacting glucose metabolism. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves innervate the pancreatic islet, but the precise innervation patterns are unknown, particularly in human. Here we demonstrate that the innervation of human islets is different from that of mouse islets and does not conform to existing models of autonomic control of islet function. By visualizing axons in three dimensions and quantifying axonal densities and contacts within pancreatic islets, we found that, unlike mouse endocrine cells, human endocrine cells are sparsely contacted by autonomic axons. Few parasympathetic cholinergic axons penetrate the human islet, and the invading sympathetic fibers preferentially innervate smooth muscle cells of blood vessels located within the islet. Thus, rather than modulating endocrine cell function directly, sympathetic nerves may regulate hormone secretion in human islets by controlling local blood flow or by acting on islet regions located downstream.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic pancreatitis is a well-known risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) development in humans, and inflammation promotes PDA initiation and progression in mouse models of the disease. However, the mechanistic link between inflammatory damage and PDA initiation is unclear. Using a Kras-driven mouse model of PDA, we establish that the inflammatory mediator Stat3 is a critical component of spontaneous and pancreatitis-accelerated PDA precursor formation and supports cell proliferation, metaplasia-associated inflammation, and MMP7 expression during neoplastic development. Furthermore, we show that Stat3 signaling enforces MMP7 expression in PDA cells and that MMP7 deletion limits tumor size and metastasis in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that serum MMP7 level in human patients with PDA correlated with metastatic disease and survival.

Abstract: In vitro studies show that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, express neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors which are linked to Ca2+ signaling. Here we describe an approach to obtain Ca2+ recordings from microglia in situ. We injected a retrovirus encoding a calcium sensor into the cortex of mice 2 days after stimulation of microglial proliferation by a stab wound injury. Microglial cells were identified with tomato lectin in acute slices prepared 3, 6, 21 and 42 days after the injury. The membrane current profile and the ameboid morphology indicated that microglial cells were activated at day 6 while at day 42 they resembled resting microglia. We recorded transient Ca2+ responses to application of ATP, endothelin-1, substance P, histamine and serotonin. The fluorescence amplitude of ATP was increased only at day 6 compared to other time points, while responses to all other ligands did not vary. Only half of the microglial cells that responded to ATP also responded to endothelin-1, serotonin and histamine. Substance P, in contrast, showed a complete overlap with the ATP responding microglial population at day 6, at day 42 this population was reduced to 55%. Cultured cells were less responsive to these ligands. This study shows that in situ microglia consist of heterogeneous populations with respect to their sensitivity to neuropeptides and -transmitters.

The Base-Pairing RNA Spot 42 Participates in a Multioutput Feedforward Loop to Help Enact Catabolite Repression in Escherichia coli,

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria selectively consume some carbon sources over others through a regulatory mechanism termed catabolite repression. Here, we show that the base-pairing RNA Spot 42 plays a broad role in catabolite repression in Escherichia coli by directly repressing genes involved in central and secondary metabolism, redox balancing, and the consumption of diverse nonpreferred carbon sources. Many of the genes repressed by Spot 42 are transcriptionally activated by the global regulator CRP. Since CRP represses Spot 42, these regulators participate in a specific regulatory circuit called a multioutput feedforward loop. We found that this loop can reduce leaky expression of target genes in the presence of glucose and can maintain repression of target genes under changing nutrient conditions. Our results suggest that base-pairing RNAs in feedforward loops can help shape the steady-state levels and dynamics of gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. To investigate the cellular origin(s) of this cancer, we assessed the effect of Trp53 and Rb1 inactivation in distinct cell types in the adult lung using adenoviral vectors that target Cre recombinase to Clara, neuroendocrine (NE), and alveolar type 2 (SPC-expressing) cells. Using these cell type-restricted Adeno-Cre viruses, we show that loss of Trp53 and Rb1 can efficiently transform NE and SPC-expressing cells leading to SCLC, albeit SPC-expressing cells at a lesser efficiency. In contrast, Clara cells were largely resistant to transformation. The results indicate that although NE cells serve as the predominant cell of origin of SCLC a subset of SPC-expressing cells are also endowed with this ability.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt canonical signaling is critical for normal development as well as homeostasis of several epithelial tissues, and constitutive activation of this pathway is commonly observed in carcinomas. We show here that 50% of human sarcomas (n = 45) and 65% of sarcoma cell lines (n = 23) of diverse histological subtypes exhibit upregulated autocrine canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, in Wnt autocrine cell lines, we identify alterations including overexpression or gene amplification of Wnt ligands and/or LRP5/6 coreceptors and epigenetic silencing of different cell surface Wnt antagonists. Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene were observed in two nonautocrine Wnt-positive sarcoma cell lines. Finally, downregulation of the activated Wnt pathway inhibited sarcoma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo by a mechanism involving the downregulation of CDC25A.

Abstract: Summary
The histone H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 plays an important role in oncogenesis, by mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the JmjC domain histone H3 demethylase NDY1 synergizes with EZH2 to silence the EZH2 inhibitor miR-101. NDY1 and EZH2 repress miR-101 by binding its promoter in concert, via a process triggered by upregulation of NDY1. Whereas EZH2 binding depends on NDY1, the latter binds independently of EZH2. However, both are required to repress transcription. NDY1 and EZH2 acting in concert upregulate EZH2 and stabilize the repression of miR-101 and its outcome. NDY1 is induced by FGF-2 via CREB phosphorylation and activation, downstream of DYRK1A, and mediates the FGF-2 and EZH2 effects on cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. The FGF-2-NDY1/EZH2-miR-101-EZH2 axis described here was found to be active in bladder cancer. These data delineate an oncogenic pathway that functionally links FGF-2 with EZH2 via NDY1 and miR-101.

Abstract: In plants, cell-to-cell communication is pivotal for the orchestration of cell fate determination, organ development, and the integration of whole plant physiology. One of the strategies for intercellular communication uses symplasmic communication channels, called plasmodesmata (PD). These PD establish unique cytoplasmic channels for the intercellular exchange not only of metabolites and small signaling molecules, but also of regulatory proteins and RNAs to allow for local orchestration of development and physiology. A number of non-cell-autonomous transcription factors (NCATFs) have been shown to function in the coordination of specific regulatory networks. To further explore the potential of such NCATFs, a genome-wide screen was performed on the transcription factor (TF) families in Arabidopsis. We here report that, among the 76 TFs examined, 22 were shown to move beyond their sites of transcription in the root apex; these NCATFs belonged to 17 TF families, including homeobox, GRAS, and MYB. Expression studies performed on variously-sized mCherry constructs identified a range of PD size exclusion limits within tissues of the root. In addition, our studies showed that actual protein level was an important factor controlling the range of TF intercellular movement. Interestingly, our studies on CAPRICE movement revealed tissue-specificity with respect to the mode of intercellular trafficking. These findings are discussed with respect to the regulation between cell-autonomous or non-cell-autonomous action.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of NF-κB, pivotal for immunity and oncogenesis, is tightly controlled by multiple feedback mechanisms. In response to DNA damage, SUMOylation of NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) is critical for NF-κB activation; however, the SUMO proteases and feedback mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here we show that among the six known Sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs), only SENP2 can efficiently associate with NEMO, deSUMOylate NEMO, and inhibit NF-κB activation induced by DNA damage. We further show that NF-κB induces SENP2 (and SENP1) transcription selectively in response to genotoxic stimuli, which involves ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent histone methylation of SENP2 promoter κB regions and NF-κB recruitment. SENP2 null cells display biphasic NEMO SUMOylation and activation of IKK and NF-κB, and higher resistance to DNA damage-induced cell death. Our study establishes a self-attenuating feedback mechanism selective to DNA damage-induced signaling to limit NF-κB-dependent cell survival responses.

Abstract: Summary
The 26S proteasome is a 2.5 MDa macromolecular machine responsible for targeted protein degradation. Recently, four chaperones were identified that promote the assembly of the 19S regulatory particle (RP). Here, we probe the dynamic architecture of the proteasome by applying quantitative proteomics and mass spectrometry (MS) of intact complexes to provide a detailed characterization of how Ubp6 assists this assembly process. Our MS data demonstrate stoichiometric binding of chaperones and Ubp6 to the basal part of the RP. Genetic interactions of Ubp6 with Hsm3, but not with the other chaperones, indicate a functional overlay with Hsm3. Our biochemical data identified Ubp6 as an additional member of the Hsm3 module. Deletions of ubp6 with hsm3 perturb 26S proteasome assembly, which we attribute to an accumulation of ubiquitylated substrates on these assembly precursors. We therefore propose that Ubp6 facilitates proteasomal assembly by clearing ubiquitylated substrates from assembly precursors by its deubiquitylating activity.

Abstract: Summary
TP53 missense mutations dramatically influence tumor progression, however, their mechanism of action is still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate the fundamental role of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 in mutant p53 oncogenic functions. Pin1 enhances tumorigenesis in a Li-Fraumeni mouse model and cooperates with mutant p53 in Ras-dependent transformation. In breast cancer cells, Pin1 promotes mutant p53 dependent inhibition of the antimetastatic factor p63 and induction of a mutant p53 transcriptional program to increase aggressiveness. Furthermore, we identified a transcriptional signature associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and, in a cohort of patients, Pin1 overexpression influenced the prognostic value of p53 mutation. These results define a Pin1/mutant p53 axis that conveys oncogenic signals to promote aggressiveness in human cancers.

Abstract: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) that modulate gene expression by inhibiting HDAC enzymes may contribute to the survival of immature hippocampal neurons. However, it remains unknown how and when HDACIs regulate the survival of newly generated immature hippocampal neurons. In the present study, if the treatment of valproic acid (VPA) and sodium butyrate (SBt) in the specific time window during the development of newly generated neurons resulted in the increased survival of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)(+) neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus in mice was investigated. It was found that the number of BrdU(+) cells, the expressions of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and pCREB [D1] were increased by HDACIs when HDACIs were treated no later than 2-3 weeks after BrdU labeling. This suggests that epigenetic modification within a specific time window is critical for the survival of newborn hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the apoptotic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) mutations cause dysregulation of energy balance and hyperinsulinemia. We have used mouse models to study the physiological roles of extrahypothalamic MC4Rs. Re-expression of MC4Rs in cholinergic neurons (ChAT-Cre, loxTB MC4R mice) modestly reduced body weight gain without altering food intake and was sufficient to normalize energy expenditure and attenuate hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, restoration of MC4R expression in brainstem neurons including those in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (Phox2b-Cre, loxTB MC4R mice) was sufficient to attenuate hyperinsulinemia, while the hyperglycemia and energy balance were not normalized. Additionally, hepatic insulin action and insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production were improved in ChAT-Cre, loxTB MC4R mice. These findings suggest that MC4Rs expressed by cholinergic neurons regulate energy expenditure and hepatic glucose production. Our results also provide further evidence of the dissociation in pathways mediating the effects of melanocortins on energy balance and glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The core planar polarity proteins localize asymmetrically to the adherens junctions of epithelial cells, where they have been hypothesized to assemble into intercellular complexes. Here, we show that the core proteins are preferentially distributed to discrete membrane subdomains (“puncta”), where they form asymmetric contacts between neighboring cells. Using an antibody internalization assay and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in prepupal and pupal wings, we have investigated the turnover of two key core proteins, Flamingo and Frizzled, and find that the localization of both within puncta is highly stable. Furthermore, the transmembrane core proteins, Flamingo, Frizzled, and Strabismus, are necessary for stable localization of core proteins to junctions, whereas the cytoplasmic core proteins are required for their concentration into puncta. Thus, we define the distinct roles of specific core proteins in the formation of asymmetric contacts between cells, which is a key event in the generation of coordinated cellular asymmetry.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanism for how RISC and microRNAs selectively and reversibly regulate mRNA translation in response to receptor signaling is unknown but could provide a means for temporal and spatial control of translation. Here we show that miR-125a targeting PSD-95 mRNA allows reversible inhibition of translation and regulation by gp1 mGluR signaling. Inhibition of miR-125a increased PSD-95 levels in dendrites and altered dendritic spine morphology. Bidirectional control of PSD-95 expression depends on miR-125a and FMRP phosphorylation status. miR-125a levels at synapses and its association with AGO2 are reduced in Fmr1 KO. FMRP phosphorylation promotes the formation of an AGO2-miR-125a inhibitory complex on PSD-95 mRNA, whereas mGluR signaling of translation requires FMRP dephosphorylation and release of AGO2 from the mRNA. These findings reveal a mechanism whereby FMRP phosphorylation provides a reversible switch for AGO2 and microRNA to selectively regulate mRNA translation at synapses in response to receptor activation.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have shown that the Hippo-Salvador-Warts (HSW) pathway restrains tissue growth by phosphorylating and inactivating the oncoprotein Yorkie. How growth-suppressive signals are transduced upstream of Hippo remains unclear. We show that the Sterile 20 family kinase, Tao-1, directly phosphorylates T195 in the Hippo activation loop and that, like other HSW pathway genes, Tao-1 functions to restrict cell proliferation in developing imaginal epithelia. This relationship appears to be evolutionarily conserved, because mammalian Tao-1 similarly affects MST kinases. In S2 cells, Tao-1 mediates the effects of the upstream HSW components Merlin and Expanded, consistent with the idea that Tao-1 functions in tissues to regulate Hippo phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that one family of Ste20 kinases can activate another and identify Tao-1 as a component of the regulatory network controlling HSW pathway signaling, and therefore tissue growth, during development.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are essential for cell growth, migration, and survival. The structure of a p110β/p85β complex identifies an inhibitory function for the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of the p85 regulatory subunit. Mutagenesis of a cSH2 contact residue activates downstream signaling in cells. This inhibitory contact ties up the C-terminal region of the p110β catalytic subunit, which is essential for lipid kinase activity. In vitro, p110β basal activity is tightly restrained by contacts with three p85 domains: the cSH2, nSH2, and iSH2. RTK phosphopeptides relieve inhibition by nSH2 and cSH2 using completely different mechanisms. The binding site for the RTK's pYXXM motif is exposed on the cSH2, requiring an extended RTK motif to reach and disrupt the inhibitory contact with p110β. This contrasts with the nSH2 where the pY-binding site itself forms the inhibitory contact. This establishes an unusual mechanism by which p85 SH2 domains contribute to RTK signaling specificities.

Abstract: Summary
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve insulin resistance by activating a nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). However, the use of TZDs is associated with plasma volume expansion through a mechanism that remains to be clarified. Here we showed that TZDs rapidly stimulate sodium-coupled bicarbonate absorption from the renal proximal tubule in vitro and in vivo. TZD-induced transport stimulation is dependent on PPARγ-Src-EGFR-ERK and observed in rat, rabbit and human, but not in mouse proximal tubules where Src-EGFR is constitutively activated. The existence of PPARγ-Src-dependent nongenomic signaling, which requires the ligand-binding ability, but not the transcriptional activity of PPARγ, is confirmed in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. The enhancement of the association between PPARγ and Src by TZDs supports an indispensable role of Src in this signaling. These results suggest that the PPARγ-dependent nongenomic stimulation of renal proximal transport is also involved in TZD-induced volume expansion.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins coordinate the fates of multiple RNAs, but the principles underlying these global interactions remain poorly understood. We elucidated regulatory mechanisms of the RNA-binding protein HuR, by integrating data from diverse high-throughput targeting technologies, specifically PAR-CLIP, RIP-chip, and whole-transcript expression profiling. The number of binding sites per transcript, degree of HuR association, and degree of HuR-dependent RNA stabilization were positively correlated. Pre-mRNA and mature mRNA containing both intronic and 3′ UTR binding sites were more highly stabilized than transcripts with only 3′ UTR or only intronic binding sites, suggesting that HuR couples pre-mRNA processing with mature mRNA stability. We also observed HuR-dependent splicing changes and substantial binding of HuR in polypyrimidine tracts of pre-mRNAs. Comparison of the spatial patterns surrounding HuR and miRNA binding sites provided functional evidence for HuR-dependent antagonism of proximal miRNA-mediated repression. We conclude that HuR coordinates gene expression outcomes at multiple interconnected steps of RNA processing.

Here, we demonstrate that activation of TGR5 in macrophages by 6α-ethyl-23(S)-methylcholic acid (6-EMCA, INT-777), a semisynthetic BA, inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production, an effect mediated by TGR5-induced cAMP signaling and subsequent NF-κB inhibition. TGR5 activation attenuated atherosclerosis in Ldlr−/−Tgr5+/+ mice but not in Ldlr−/−Tgr5−/− double-knockout mice. The inhibition of lesion formation was associated with decreased intraplaque inflammation and less plaque macrophage content. Furthermore, Ldlr−/− animals transplanted with Tgr5−/− bone marrow did not show an inhibition of atherosclerosis by INT-777, further establishing an important role of leukocytes in INT-777-mediated inhibition of vascular lesion formation. Taken together, these data attribute a significant immune modulating function to TGR5 activation in the prevention of atherosclerosis, an important facet of the metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
The human gene Ptpn11, which encodes the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, may act as a proto-oncogene because dominantly activating mutations have been detected in several types of leukemia. Herein we report a tumor-suppressor function of Shp2. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Shp2 promotes inflammatory signaling through the Stat3 pathway and hepatic inflammation/necrosis, resulting in regenerative hyperplasia and development of tumors in aged mice. Furthermore, Shp2 ablation dramatically enhanced diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, which was abolished by concurrent deletion of Shp2 and Stat3 in hepatocytes. Decreased Shp2 expression was detected in a subfraction of human HCC specimens. Thus, in contrast to the leukemogenic effect of dominant-active mutants, Ptpn11/Shp2 has a tumor-suppressor function in liver.

Abstract: Summary
The interplay between sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, histone-modifying enzymes, and chromatin-remodeling enzymes underpins transcriptional regulation. Although it is known how single domains of chromatin “readers” bind specific histone modifications, how combinations of histone marks are recognized and decoded is poorly understood. Moreover, the role of histone binding in regulating the enzymatic activity of chromatin readers is not known. Here we focus on the TGF-β superfamily transcriptional repressor TIF1γ/TRIM33/Ectodermin and demonstrate that its PHD finger-bromodomain constitutes a multivalent histone-binding module that specifically binds histone H3 tails unmethylated at K4 and R2 and acetylated at two key lysines. TIF1γ's ability to ubiquitinate its substrate Smad4 requires its PHD finger-bromodomain, as does its transcriptional repressor activity. Most importantly, TIF1γ's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is induced by histone binding. We propose a model of TIF1γ activity in which it dictates the residence time of activated Smad complexes at promoters of TGF-β superfamily target genes.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) suppresses food intake and body weight (BW), but the intracellular signals mediating these effects are unknown. Here, hindbrain (fourth i.c.v.) GLP-1R activation by Exendin-4 (Ex-4) increased PKA and MAPK activity and decreased phosphorylation of AMPK in NTS. PKA and MAPK signaling contribute to food intake and BW suppression by Ex-4, as inhibitors RpcAMP and U0126 (fourth i.c.v.), respectively, attenuated Ex-4's effects. Hindbrain GLP-1R activation inhibited feeding by reducing meal number, not meal size. This effect was attenuated with stimulation of AMPK activity by AICAR (fourth i.c.v.). The PKA, MAPK, and AMPK signaling responses by Ex-4 were present in immortalized GLP-1R-expressing neurons (GT1-7). In conclusion, hindbrain GLP-1R activation suppresses food intake and BW through coordinated PKA-mediated suppression of AMPK and activation of MAPK. Pharmacotherapies targeting these signaling pathways, which mediate intake-suppressive effects of CNS GLP-1R activation, may prove efficacious in treating obesity.

Abstract: In this study, we synthesized a new cell immobilization support having poly(glycidyl methacrylate) as a graft polymer chain and used this support for cell cultivation. Base polymer particle was synthesized by suspension polymerization and epoxy polymer chain was extended from particle surface on graft polymerization. Produced polymer particles had broad particle size distribution ranging from 20 to 1000μm and the degree of polymerization of grafted polymer chain was ranged from 500 to 1000. The effects of various factors, such as grafted polymer chain length and its surface density, composition of base polymer network and graft polymer chain, on the cell growth of murine fibroblast cell line (MS-5 cell) on polymer particle were studied. This polymer particle could cultivate not only fibroblast cell line but also epidermal cell line (HeLa cell), osteoblast cell line (MC3T3E1 cell), and chondrocyte cell line (ch-8 cell) on its surface. Growth rate is almost the same as that of cells using poly(styrene) tissue culture dish. To apply this cell cultivation system for examination of cell co-culture, HeLa cell immobilized on 100μm of polymer particle was successfully co-cultured with MS-5 cell immobilized on 300μm of polymer particle for four weeks.

Abstract: Summary
Recent evidence for 5′-cytosine (C)-rich overhangs at the telomeres of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provided the impetus to re-examine the end structure of mammalian telomeres. Two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, single telomere-length analysis (STELA), and strand-specific exonuclease assays revealed the presence of a 5′-C-rich overhang at the telomeres of human and mouse chromosomes. C-overhangs were prominent in G1/S arrested as well as terminally differentiated cells, indicating that they did not represent replication intermediates. C-rich overhangs were far more prevalent in tumor cells engaged in the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway of telomere maintenance, which relies on the homologous recombination (HR) machinery. Transient siRNA-based depletion of the HR-specific proteins RAD51, RAD52, and XRCC3 resulted in changes in C-overhang levels, implicating the involvement of 5′-C-overhangs in the HR-dependent pathway of telomere maintenance.

A Genetic Screen for Leaf Movement Mutants Identifies a Potential Role for AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 (AGL6) in Circadian-Clock Control,

Abstract: The circadian clock in plants regulates many important physiological and biological processes, including leaf movement. We have used an imaging system to genetically screen Arabidopsis seedlings for altered leaf movement with the aim of identifying a circadian clock gene. A total of 285 genes were selected from publicly available microarrays that showed an expression pattern similar to those of the Arabidopsis core oscillator genes. We subsequently isolated 42 homozygous recessive mutants and analyzed their leaf movements. We also analyzed leaf movements of activation tagging mutants that showed altered flowering time. We found that agl6-1D plants, in which AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 (AGL6) was activated by the 35S enhancer, showed a shortened period of leaf movement as well as a high level of ZEITLUPE (ZTL) expression, reduced amplitude of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) expression, and arrhythmic TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1)/CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1)expression. A shortened period of leaf movement was also seen in 35S-AGL6-myc plants, although 35S-amiRAGL6 plants, transgenic plants overexpressing an artificial miRNA (amiR) targeting AGL6, showed unaltered leaf movement. The amplitude of CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN 2 (CAB2) expression, a circadian output gene, was also reduced in agl6-1D plants. Taken together, these results suggest that AGL6 plays a potential role in the regulation of the circadian clock by regulating ZTL mRNA level in Arabidopsis.

Abstract: Summary
The ClpS adaptor delivers N-end rule substrates to ClpAP, an energy-dependent AAA+ protease, for degradation. How ClpS binds specific N-end residues is known in atomic detail and clarified here, but the delivery mechanism is poorly understood. We show that substrate binding is enhanced when ClpS binds hexameric ClpA. Reciprocally, N-end rule substrates increase ClpS affinity for ClpA6. Enhanced binding requires the N-end residue and a peptide bond of the substrate, as well as multiple aspects of ClpS, including a side chain that contacts the substrate α-amino group and the flexible N-terminal extension (NTE). Finally, enhancement also needs the N domain and AAA+ rings of ClpA, connected by a long linker. The NTE can be engaged by the ClpA translocation pore, but ClpS resists unfolding/degradation. We propose a staged-delivery model that illustrates how intimate contacts between the substrate, adaptor, and protease reprogram specificity and coordinate handoff from the adaptor to the protease.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) control eukaryotic cell division, but assigning specific functions to individual CDKs remains a challenge. During the mammalian cell cycle, Cdk2 forms active complexes before Cdk1, but lack of Cdk2 protein does not block cell-cycle progression. To detect requirements and define functions for Cdk2 activity in human cells when normal expression levels are preserved, and nonphysiologic compensation by other CDKs is prevented, we replaced the wild-type kinase with a version sensitized to specific inhibition by bulky adenine analogs. The sensitizing mutation also impaired a noncatalytic function of Cdk2 in restricting assembly of cyclin A with Cdk1, but this defect could be corrected by both inhibitory and noninhibitory analogs. This allowed either chemical rescue or selective antagonism of Cdk2 activity in vivo, to uncover a requirement in cell proliferation, and nonredundant, rate-limiting roles in restriction point passage and S phase entry.

Abstract: Summary
Collective cell migration is a mode of movement crucial for morphogenesis and cancer metastasis. However, little is known about how migratory cells coordinate collectively. Here we show that mutual cell-cell attraction (named here coattraction) is required to maintain cohesive clusters of migrating mesenchymal cells. Coattraction can counterbalance the natural tendency of cells to disperse via mechanisms such as contact inhibition and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Neural crest cells are coattracted via the complement fragment C3a and its receptor C3aR, revealing an unexpected role of complement proteins in early vertebrate development. Loss of coattraction disrupts collective and coordinated movements of these cells. We propose that coattraction and contact inhibition act in concert to allow cell collectives to self-organize and respond efficiently to external signals, such as chemoattractants and repellents.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastomas display cellular hierarchies containing tumor-propagating glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). STAT3 is a critical signaling node in GSC maintenance but molecular mechanisms underlying STAT3 activation in GSCs are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that the bone marrow X-linked (BMX) nonreceptor tyrosine kinase activates STAT3 signaling to maintain self-renewal and tumorigenic potential of GSCs. BMX is differentially expressed in GSCs relative to nonstem cancer cells and neural progenitors. BMX knockdown potently inhibited STAT3 activation, expression of GSC transcription factors, and growth of GSC-derived intracranial tumors. Constitutively active STAT3 rescued the effects of BMX downregulation, supporting that BMX signals through STAT3 in GSCs. These data demonstrate that BMX represents a GSC therapeutic target and reinforces the importance of STAT3 signaling in stem-like cancer phenotypes.

Abstract: The mutation of phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome (PHEX) can lead to human X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets which displays hypo-mineralization in bone and dentin. To study its possible roles in teeth, PHEX antibody was injected into pregnant mice on E15 to explore its roles on the formation of enamel and dentin. Mallory trichrome staining results showed that arrangements of ameloblasts and odontoblasts were irregular after PHEX antibody treatment. Differentiation of odontoblasts and the formation of dentin were inhibited. Spatiotemporal distribution of PHEX protein was observed in various stages of tooth germ. Immunohistochemical results showed positive PHEX signals appeared in the inner enamel epithelium on E16 and became stronger on E18. Ameloblasts and odontoblasts showed much higher PHEX expression on P1 and P3. Expression of PHEX in odontoblasts decreased accordingly. However, enamel formation was only slightly affected. The findings proved that a decrease in PHEX expression could suppress dentin formation.

Abstract: Summary
MDM2 plays a key role in modulating p53 function. The MDM2 SNP309T > G promoter polymorphism enhances Sp1 binding and has been linked to cancer risk and young age at diagnosis although with conflicting evidence. We report a second MDM2 promoter polymorphism, SNP285G > C, residing on the SNP309G allele. SNP285C occurs in Caucasians only, where 7.7% (95% CI 7.6%–7.8%) of healthy individuals carry the SNP285C/309G haplotype. In vitro analyses reveals that SNP309G enhances but SNP285C strongly reduces Sp1 promoter binding. Comparing MDM2 promoter status among different cohorts of ovarian (n = 1993) and breast (n = 1973) cancer patients versus healthy controls (n = 3646), SNP285C reduced the risk of both ovarian (OR 0.74; CI 0.58–0.94) and breast cancer (OR 0.79; CI 0.62–1.00) among SNP309G carriers.

Abstract: The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an essential structural framework for cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation, and undergoes progressive changes during senescence. To investigate changes in protein expression in the extracellular matrix between young and senescent fibroblasts, we compared proteomic data (LTQ-FT) with cDNA microarray results. The peptide counts from the proteomics analysis were used to evaluate the level of ECM protein expression by young cells and senescent cells, and ECM protein expression data were compared with the microarray data. After completing the comparative analysis, we grouped the genes into four categories. Class I included genes with increased expression levels in both analyses, while class IV contained genes with reduced expression in both analyses. Class II and Class III contained genes with an inconsistent expression pattern. Finally, we validated the comparative analysis results by examining the expression level of the specific gene from each category using Western blot analysis and semiquantitative RT-PCR. Our results demonstrate that comparative analysis can be used to identify differentially expressed genes.

Abstract: Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play important roles in synaptic plasticity by regulating cAMP signaling in various organisms. The supershort, short, and long forms of Aplysia PDE4 (apPDE4) have been cloned, and the long form has been shown to play a crucial role in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced synaptic plasticity in Aplysia. To address the role of the supershort form in 5-HT-induced synaptic plasticity in Aplysia, we overexpressed the apPDE4 supershort form in Aplysia sensory neurons. Consequently, 5-HT-induced hyperexcitability and short-term facilitation in nondepressed synapses were blocked. However, the supershort form did not inhibit 5-HT-induced short-term facilitation in highly depressed synapses. These results show that the supershort form plays an important role in 5-HT-induced synaptic plasticity and disrupts it mainly by impairing cAMP signaling in Aplysia.

Abstract: Summary
Thrombin is a key protease involved in blood coagulation, complement activation, inflammation, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. Although induced in many (patho-)physiological conditions, the underlying mechanisms controlling prothrombin expression remained enigmatic. We have now discovered that prothrombin expression is regulated by a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism responding to stress and inflammation. This mechanism is triggered by external stimuli that activate p38 MAPK. In turn, p38 MAPK upmodulates canonical 3′ end processing components and phosphorylates the RNA-binding proteins FBP2 and FBP3, which inhibit 3′ end processing of mRNAs, such as prothrombin mRNA, that bear a defined upstream sequence element (USE) in their 3′UTRs. Upon phosphorylation, FBP2 and FBP3 dissociate from the USE, making it accessible to proteins that stimulate 3′ end processing. We provide in vivo evidence suggesting the importance of this mechanism in inflammatory hypercoagulation and tumor invasion. Regulated 3′ end processing thus emerges as a key mechanism of gene regulation with broad biological and medical implications.

Abstract: Summary
Cytoplasmic dynein mediates spindle orientation from the cell cortex through interactions with astral microtubules, but neither the mechanism governing its cortical targeting nor the regulation thereof is well understood. Here we show that yeast dynein offloads from microtubule plus ends to the daughter cell cortex. Mutants with an engineered peptide inserted between the tail domain and the motor head retain wild-type motor activity but exhibit enhanced offloading and cortical targeting. Conversely, shortening the “neck” sequence between the tail and motor domains precludes offloading from the microtubule plus ends. Furthermore, chimeric mutants with mammalian dynein “neck” sequences rescue targeting and function. These findings provide direct support for an active microtubule-mediated delivery process that appears to be regulated by a conserved masking/unmasking mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Bcl-2 family members are key regulators of apoptosis. Their involvement in other cellular processes has been so far overlooked. We have studied the role of the Bcl-2 homolog Nrz in the developing zebrafish. Nrz was found to be localized to the yolk syncytial layer, a region containing numerous mitochondria and ER membranes. Nrz knockdown resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation, due to free Ca2+ increase in the yolk cell, activating myosin light chain kinase, which led to premature contraction of actin-myosin cables in the margin and separation of the blastomeres from the yolk cell. In the yolk syncytial layer, Nrz appears to prevent the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum by directly interacting with the IP3R1 Ca2+ channel. Thus, the Bcl-2 family may participate in early development, not only by controlling apoptosis but also by acting on cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movements via Ca2+ fluxes inside the embryo.

Abstract: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups – A, B and C. A dose of 5mg and 10mg of cadmium chloride/kg body weight/day was orally administered to groups B and C, respectively. Rats from group A served as control. Rats were sacrificed on 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th week after initiation of the experiment. Kidneys were removed immediately, fixed in Bouin's fixative, routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The present study showed that the histopathological changes were caused in kidney of rats by cadmium exposure. The changes noticed were mainly – the glomerular swelling (at initial stage), the shrinkage of glomerulus (at later stage), the tubular dilatation, hypertrophy of tubular epithelium, degeneration of glomerulus and renal tubules and deposition of eosin-positive substances in the glomerulus and renal tubules. However, lesions were depended upon the doses and duration of the treatment.

Abstract: Summary
In flies and mammals, extracellular Hedgehog (Hh) molecules alter cell fates and proliferation by regulating the levels and activities of Ci/Gli family transcription factors. How Hh-induced activation of transmembrane Smoothened (Smo) proteins reverses Ci/Gli inhibition by Suppressor of Fused (SuFu) and kinesin family protein (Cos2/Kif7) binding partners is a major unanswered question. Here we show that the Fused (Fu) protein kinase is activated by Smo and Cos2 via Fu- and CK1-dependent phosphorylation. Activated Fu can recapitulate a full Hh response, stabilizing full-length Ci via Cos2 phosphorylation and activating full-length Ci by antagonizing Su(fu) and by other mechanisms. We propose that Smo/Cos2 interactions stimulate Fu autoactivation by concentrating Fu at the membrane. Autoactivation primes Fu for additional CK1-dependent phosphorylation, which further enhances kinase activity. In this model, Smo acts like many transmembrane receptors associated with cytoplasmic kinases, such that pathway activation is mediated by kinase oligomerization and trans-phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Proper formation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes is essential for the fitness of all eukaryotic cells. Carboxyl methylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit plays a critical role in regulating holoenzyme assembly; methylation is catalyzed by PP2A-specific methyltransferase LCMT-1, an enzyme required for cell survival. We determined crystal structures of human LCMT-1 in isolation and in complex with PP2A stabilized by a cofactor mimic. The structures show that the LCMT-1 active-site pocket recognizes the carboxyl terminus of PP2A, and, interestingly, the PP2A active site makes extensive contacts to LCMT-1. We demonstrated that activation of the PP2A active site stimulates methylation, suggesting a mechanism for efficient conversion of activated PP2A into substrate-specific holoenzymes, thus minimizing unregulated phosphatase activity or formation of inactive holoenzymes. A dominant-negative LCMT-1 mutant attenuates the cell cycle without causing cell death, likely by inhibiting uncontrolled phosphatase activity. Our studies suggested mechanisms of LCMT-1 in tight control of PP2A function, important for the cell cycle and cell survival.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(A) polymerases (PAPs) are found in most living organisms and have important roles in RNA function and metabolism. Here, we report the crystal structure of human PAPD1, a noncanonical PAP that can polyadenylate RNAs in the mitochondria (also known as mtPAP) and oligouridylate histone mRNAs (TUTase1). The overall structure of the palm and fingers domains is similar to that in the canonical PAPs. The active site is located at the interface between the two domains, with a large pocket that can accommodate the substrates. The structure reveals the presence of a previously unrecognized domain in the N-terminal region of PAPD1, with a backbone fold that is similar to that of RNP-type RNA binding domains. This domain (named the RL domain), together with a β-arm insertion in the palm domain, contributes to dimerization of PAPD1. Surprisingly, our mutagenesis and biochemical studies show that dimerization is required for the catalytic activity of PAPD1.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells convey proangiogenic programs that counteract the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy. Here, we show that blocking angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), a TIE2 ligand and angiogenic factor expressed by activated endothelial cells (ECs), regresses the tumor vasculature and inhibits progression of late-stage, metastatic MMTV-PyMT mammary carcinomas and RIP1-Tag2 pancreatic insulinomas. ANG2 blockade did not inhibit recruitment of MRC1+ TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) but impeded their upregulation of Tie2, association with blood vessels, and ability to restore angiogenesis in tumors. Conditional Tie2 gene knockdown in TEMs was sufficient to decrease tumor angiogenesis. Our findings support a model wherein the ANG2-TIE2 axis mediates cell-to-cell interactions between TEMs and ECs that are important for tumor angiogenesis and can be targeted to induce effective antitumor responses.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are versatile regulators of gene expression and undergo complex maturation processes. However, the mechanism(s) stabilizing or reducing these small RNAs remains poorly understood. Here we identify mammalian immune regulator MCPIP1 (Zc3h12a) ribonuclease as a broad suppressor of miRNA activity and biogenesis, which counteracts Dicer, a central ribonuclease in miRNA processing. MCPIP1 suppresses miRNA biosynthesis via cleavage of the terminal loops of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). MCPIP1 also carries a vertebrate-specific oligomerization domain important for pre-miRNA recognition, indicating its recent evolution. Furthermore, we observed potential antagonism between MCPIP1 and Dicer function in human cancer and found a regulatory role of MCPIP1 in the signaling axis comprising miR-155 and its target c-Maf. These results collectively suggest that the balance between processing and destroying ribonucleases modulates miRNA biogenesis and potentially affects pathological miRNA dysregulation. The presence of this abortive processing machinery and diversity of MCPIP1-related genes may imply a dynamic evolutional transition of the RNA silencing system.

Abstract: Summary
Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) provide powerful experimental tools by enabling stable and regulated gene silencing through programming of endogenous microRNA pathways. Since requirements for efficient shRNA biogenesis and target suppression are largely unknown, many predicted shRNAs fail to efficiently suppress their target. To overcome this barrier, we developed a “Sensor assay” that enables the biological identification of effective shRNAs at large scale. By constructing and evaluating 20,000 RNAi reporters covering every possible target site in nine mammalian transcripts, we show that our assay reliably identifies potent shRNAs that are surprisingly rare and predominantly missed by existing algorithms. Our unbiased analyses reveal that potent shRNAs share various predicted and previously unknown features associated with specific microRNA processing steps, and suggest a model for competitive strand selection. Together, our study establishes a powerful tool for large-scale identification of highly potent shRNAs and provides insights into sequence requirements of effective RNAi.

Abstract: Summary
The 7-methylguanosine cap added to the 5′ end of mRNA is required for efficient gene expression in eukaryotes. In mammals, methylation of the guanosine cap is catalyzed by RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase), an enzyme previously thought to function as a monomer. We have identified an obligate component of the mammalian cap methyltransferase, RAM (RNMT-Activating Mini protein)/Fam103a1, a previously uncharacterized protein. RAM consists of an N-terminal RNMT-activating domain and a C-terminal RNA-binding domain. As monomers RNMT and RAM have a relatively weak affinity for RNA; however, together their RNA affinity is significantly increased. RAM is required for efficient cap methylation in vitro and in vivo, and is indirectly required to maintain mRNA expression levels, for mRNA translation and for cell viability. Our findings demonstrate that RAM is an essential component of the core gene expression machinery.

Abstract: Summary
In skeletal muscle differentiation, muscle-specific genes are regulated by two groups of transcription factors, the MyoD and MEF2 families, which work together to drive the differentiation process. Here, we show that ERK5 regulates muscle cell fusion through Klf transcription factors. The inhibition of ERK5 activity suppresses muscle cell fusion with minimal effects on the expression of MyoD, MEF2, and their target genes. Promoter analysis coupled to microarray assay reveals that Klf-binding motifs are highly enriched in the promoter regions of ERK5-dependent upregulated genes. Remarkably, Klf2 and Klf4 expression are also upregulated during differentiation in an ERK5-dependent manner, and knockdown of Klf2 or Klf4 specifically suppresses muscle cell fusion. Moreover, we show that Sp1 transcription factor links ERK5 to Klf2/4, and that nephronectin, a Klf transcriptional target, is involved in muscle cell fusion. Therefore, an ERK5/Sp1/Klf module plays a key role in the fusion process during skeletal muscle differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Through unknown mechanisms, insulin activates the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1c) transcription factor to promote hepatic lipogenesis. We find that this induction is dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). To further define the role of mTORC1 in the regulation of SREBP1c in the liver, we generated mice with liver-specific deletion of TSC1 (LTsc1KO), which results in insulin-independent activation of mTORC1. Surprisingly, the LTsc1KO mice are protected from age- and diet-induced hepatic steatosis and display hepatocyte-intrinsic defects in SREBP1c activation and de novo lipogenesis. These phenotypes result from attenuation of Akt signaling driven by mTORC1-dependent insulin resistance. Therefore, mTORC1 activation is not sufficient to stimulate hepatic SREBP1c in the absence of Akt signaling, revealing the existence of an additional downstream pathway also required for this induction. We provide evidence that this mTORC1-independent pathway involves Akt-mediated suppression of Insig2a, a liver-specific transcript encoding the SREBP1c inhibitor INSIG2.

Abstract: Summary
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase that is constitutively activated in certain cancers, following gene alterations such as chromosomal translocation, amplification, or point mutation. Here, we identified CH5424802, a potent, selective, and orally available ALK inhibitor with a unique chemical scaffold, showing preferential antitumor activity against cancers with gene alterations of ALK, such as nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cells expressing NPM-ALK fusion in vitro and in vivo. CH5424802 inhibited ALK L1196M, which corresponds to the gatekeeper mutation conferring common resistance to kinase inhibitors, and blocked EML4-ALK L1196M-driven cell growth. Our results support the potential for clinical evaluation of CH5424802 for the treatment of patients with ALK-driven tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA damage response involves a complex network of processes that detect and repair DNA damage. Here we show that miRNA biogenesis is globally induced upon DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner. About one-fourth of miRNAs are significantly upregulated after DNA damage, while loss of ATM abolishes their induction. KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) is a key player that translates DNA damage signaling to miRNA biogenesis. The ATM kinase directly binds to and phosphorylates KSRP, leading to enhanced interaction between KSRP and pri-miRNAs and increased KSRP activity in miRNA processing. Mutations of the ATM phosphorylation sites of KSRP impaired its activity in regulating miRNAs. These findings reveal a mechanism by which DNA damage signaling is linked to miRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
p120-catenin (p120ctn) interacts with E-cadherin, but to our knowledge, no formal proof that p120ctn functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene has emerged to date. We report herein that p120ctn loss leads to tumor development in mice. We have generated a conditional knockout model of p120ctn whereby mice develop preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the oral cavity, esophagus, and squamous forestomach. Tumor-derived cells secrete granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). The tumors contain significant desmoplasia and immune cell infiltration. Immature myeloid cells comprise a significant percentage of the immune cells present and likely participate in fostering a favorable tumor microenvironment, including the activation of fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Perturbed DNA replication in early stages of cancer development induces chromosomal instability preferentially at fragile sites. However, the molecular basis for this instability is unknown. Here, we show that even under normal growth conditions, replication fork progression along the fragile site, FRA16C, is slow and forks frequently stall at AT-rich sequences, leading to activation of additional origins to enable replication completion. Under mild replication stress, the frequency of stalling at AT-rich sequences is further increased. Strikingly, unlike in the entire genome, in the FRA16C region additional origins are not activated, suggesting that all potential origins are already activated under normal conditions. Thus, the basis for FRA16C fragility is replication fork stalling at AT-rich sequences and inability to activate additional origins under replication stress. Our results provide a mechanism explaining the replication stress sensitivity of fragile sites and thus, the basis for genomic instability during early stages of cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
The full scale of human miRNome in specific cell or tissue, especially in cancers, remains to be determined. An in-depth analysis of miRNomes in human normal liver, hepatitis liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was carried out in this study. We found nine miRNAs accounted for ∼88.2% of the miRNome in human liver. The third most highly expressed miR-199a/b-3p is consistently decreased in HCC, and its decrement significantly correlates with poor survival of HCC patients. Moreover, miR-199a/b-3p can target tumor-promoting PAK4 to suppress HCC growth through inhibiting PAK4/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides miRNomes of human liver and HCC and contributes to better understanding of the important deregulated miRNAs in HCC and liver diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Cells are dependent on correct sorting of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) for the outcome of growth factor signaling. Upon activation, RTKs are coupled through the endocytic machinery for degradation or recycled to the cell surface. However, the molecular mechanisms governing RTK recycling are poorly understood. Here, we show that Golgi-localized gamma ear-containing Arf-binding protein 3 (GGA3) interacts selectively with the Met/hepatocyte growth factor RTK when stimulated, to sort it for recycling in association with “gyrating” clathrin. GGA3 loss abrogates Met recycling from a Rab4 endosomal subdomain, resulting in pronounced trafficking of Met toward degradation. Decreased Met recycling attenuates ERK activation and cell migration. Met recycling, sustained ERK activation, and migration require interaction of GGA3 with Arf6 and an unexpected association with the Crk adaptor. The data show that GGA3 defines an active recycling pathway and support a broader role for GGA3-mediated cargo selection in targeting receptors destined for recycling.

Abstract: Summary
Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme required for DNA synthesis and repair. Although iron is necessary for class Ia RNR activity, little is known about the mechanisms that control RNR in response to iron deficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that yeast cells control RNR function during iron deficiency by redistributing the Rnr2-Rnr4 small subunit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Our data support a Mec1/Rad53-independent mechanism in which the iron-regulated Cth1/Cth2 mRNA-binding proteins specifically interact with the WTM1 mRNA in response to iron scarcity and promote its degradation. The resulting decrease in the nuclear-anchoring Wtm1 protein levels leads to the redistribution of the Rnr2-Rnr4 heterodimer to the cytoplasm, where it assembles as an active RNR complex and increases deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels. When iron is scarce, yeast selectively optimizes RNR function at the expense of other non-essential iron-dependent processes that are repressed, to allow DNA synthesis and repair.

Abstract: Summary
In the field of breast biology, there is a growing appreciation for the “gatekeeping function” of basal cells during development and disease processes yet mechanisms regulating the generation of these cells are poorly understood. Here, we report that the proliferation of basal cells is controlled by SLIT/ROBO1 signaling and that production of these cells regulates outgrowth of mammary branches. We identify the negative regulator TGF-β1 upstream of Robo1 and show that it induces Robo1 expression specifically in the basal layer, functioning together with SLIT2 to restrict branch formation. Loss of SLIT/ROBO1 signaling in this layer alone results in precocious branching due to a surplus of basal cells. SLIT2 limits basal cell proliferation by inhibiting canonical WNT signaling, increasing the cytoplasmic and membrane pools of β-catenin at the expense of its nuclear pool. Together, our studies provide mechanistic insight into how specification of basal cell number influences branching morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic differentiation critically depends on combinations of transcriptional regulators controlling the development of individual lineages. Here, we report the genome-wide binding sites for the five key hematopoietic transcription factors—GATA1, GATA2, RUNX1, FLI1, and TAL1/SCL—in primary human megakaryocytes. Statistical analysis of the 17,263 regions bound by at least one factor demonstrated that simultaneous binding by all five factors was the most enriched pattern and often occurred near known hematopoietic regulators. Eight genes not previously appreciated to function in hematopoiesis that were bound by all five factors were shown to be essential for thrombocyte and/or erythroid development in zebrafish. Moreover, one of these genes encoding the PDZK1IP1 protein shared transcriptional enhancer elements with the blood stem cell regulator TAL1/SCL. Multifactor ChIP-Seq analysis in primary human cells coupled with a high-throughput in vivo perturbation screen therefore offers a powerful strategy to identify essential regulators of complex mammalian differentiation processes.

Abstract: Summary
E3 ligases mediate the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins thereby enabling ubiquitin-dependent signaling. Unraveling how E3 ligases are regulated is important because miscontrolled ubiquitylation can lead to disease. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins are E3 ligases that modulate diverse biological processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Here, we have solved the structure of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of cIAP1 and identified that it is required for cIAP1 autoregulation. We demonstrate that the CARD inhibits activation of cIAP1's E3 activity by preventing RING dimerization, E2 binding, and E2 activation. Moreover, we show that the CARD is required to suppress cell proliferation and migration. Further, CARD-mediated autoregulation is also necessary to maximally suppress caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and vascular tree degeneration in vivo. Taken together, our data reveal mechanisms by which the E3 ligase activity of cIAP1 is controlled, and how its deregulation impacts on cell proliferation, migration and cell survival.

Abstract: Summary
Sirtuins are NAD-dependent deacetylases that sense oxidative stress conditions and promote a protective cellular response. The Sirtuin SirT1 is involved in facultative heterochromatin formation through an intimate functional relationship with the H3K9me3 methyltransferase Suv39h1, a chromatin organization protein. However, SirT1 also regulates Suv39h1-dependent constitutive heterochromatin (CH) through an unknown mechanism; interestingly, SirT1 does not significantly localize in these regions. Herein, we report that SirT1 controls global levels of Suv39h1 by increasing its half-life through inhibition of Suv39h1 lysine 87 polyubiquitination by the E3-ubiquitin ligase MDM2. This in turn increases Suv39h1 turnover in CH and ensures genome integrity. Stress conditions that lead to SirT1 upregulation, such as calorie restriction, also induce higher levels of Suv39h1 in a SirT1-dependent manner in vivo. These observations reflect a direct link between oxidative stress response and Suv39h1 and support a dynamic view of heterochromatin, in which its structure adapts to cell physiology.

Abstract: Summary
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) restricts mitotic exit to cells that have completed chromosome-microtubule attachment. Cdc20 is a bifunctional protein. In complex with SAC proteins Mad2, BubR1, and Bub3, Cdc20 forms the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which binds the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and inhibits its mitotic exit-promoting activity. When devoid of SAC proteins, Cdc20 serves as an APC/C coactivator and promotes mitotic exit. During mitotic arrest, Cdc20 is continuously degraded via ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and resynthesized. It is believed that this cycle keeps the levels of Cdc20 below a threshold above which Cdc20 would promote mitotic exit. We report that p31comet, a checkpoint antagonist, is necessary for mitotic destabilization of Cdc20. p31comet depletion stabilizes the MCC, super-inhibits the APC/C, and delays mitotic exit, indicating that Cdc20 proteolysis in prometaphase opposes the checkpoint. Our studies reveal a homeostatic network in which checkpoint-sustaining and -repressing forces oppose each other during mitotic arrest and suggest ways for enhancing the sensitivity of cancer cells to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are used therapeutically for hematological diseases and may also serve as a source for nonhematopoietic tissue engineering in the future. In other cell types, ion channels have been investigated as potential targets for the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. However, the ion channels of HSCs remain elusive. Here, we functionally characterized the ion channels of CD34+ cells from human peripheral blood. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we confirmed that the CD34+ cells also express CD45 and CD133. In the CD34+/CD45+/CD133high HSCs, RT-PCR of 58 ion channel mRNAs revealed the coexpression of Kv1.3, Kv7.1, Nav1.7, TASK2, TALK2, TWIK2, TRPC4, TRPC6, TRPM2, TRPM7, and TRPV2. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings identified voltage-gated K+ currents (putatively Kv1.3), pH-sensitive TASK2-like background K+ currents, ADP-ribose-activated TRPM2 currents, temperature-sensitive TRPV2-like currents, and diacylglycerol-analogue-activated TRPC6-like currents. Our results lend new insight into the physiological role of ion channels in HSCs, the specific implications of which require further investigation.

Abstract: Summary
In amniotes, ventral folding morphogenesis achieves gut internalization, linear heart tube formation, ventral body wall closure, and encasement of the fetus in extraembryonic membranes. Impairment of ventral morphogenesis results in human birth defects involving body wall, gut, and heart malformations and in mouse misplacement of head and heart. Absence of knowledge about genetic pathways and cell populations directing ventral folding in mammals has precluded systematic study of cellular mechanisms driving this vital morphogenetic process. We report tissue-specific mouse mutant analyses identifying the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway as a key regulator of ventral morphogenesis. BMP2 expressed in anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) signals to epiblast derivatives during gastrulation to orchestrate initial stages of ventral morphogenesis, including foregut development and positioning of head and heart. These findings identify unanticipated functions for the AVE in organizing the gastrulating embryo and indicate that visceral endoderm-expressed BMP2 coordinates morphogenetic cell behaviors in multiple epiblast lineages.

Abstract: Previously, we identified 3 overlapping regions showing loss of heterozygosity (LOH, R1-R3 from 11 to 30 cM) on chromosome 17 in 45 primary gastric cancers (GCs). The data indicated the presence of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) on chromosome 17 involved in GC. Among the putative TSGs in these regions, HIC1 (in SR1) and TOB1 (in SR3) remain to be examined in GC. By immunohistochemistry (IHC), methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and western blot, we evaluated the expression and regulation status for HIC1 and TOB1 protein in GC. We narrowed down the deletion intervals on chromosome 17 and defined five smaller LOH subregions, SR1-SR5 (0.54 to 3.42 cM), in GC. We found that HIC1 had downregulated expression in 86% (91/106) and was methylated in 87% (26/30) of primary GCs. Of the primary GCs showing downregulation of HIC1 protein, 75% (18/24) had methylated HIC1 gene. TOB1 was either absent or expressed at reduced levels in 75% (73/97) of the GC samples. In addition, a general reduction was found in total and the ratio of unphosphorylated to phosphorylated TOB1 protein levels in the differentiated GC cell lines. Further analysis revealed significant simultaneous downregulation of both HIC1 and TOB1 protein in GC tissue microarray samples (67%, 52/78) and in primary GCs (65%, 11/17). These results indicate that silencing of HIC1 and TOB1 expression is a common occurrence in GC and may contribute to the development and progression of the disease.

Abstract: The augmentation of neurotransmitter and hormone release produced by ouabain inhibition of plasmalemmal Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) is well established. However, the mechanism underlying this action is still controversial. Here we have shown that in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells ouabain diminished the mobility of chromaffin vesicles, an indication of greater number of docked vesicles at subplasmalemmal exocytotic sites. On the other hand, ouabain augmented the number of vesicles undergoing exocytosis in response to a K+ pulse, rather than the quantal size of single vesicles. Furthermore, ouabain produced a tiny and slow Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and gradually augmented the transient elevations of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]c) triggered by K+ pulses. These effects were paralleled by gradual increments of the transient catecholamine release responses triggered by sequential K+ pulses applied to chromaffin cell populations treated with ouabain. Both, the increases of K+-elicited [Ca2+]c and secretion in ouabain-treated cells were blocked by thapsigargin (THAPSI), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and caffeine. These results are compatible with the view that ouabain may enhance the ER Ca2+ load and facilitate the Ca2+-induced-Ca2+ release (CICR) component of the [Ca2+]c signal generated during K+ depolarisation. This could explain the potentiating effects of ouabain on exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Defective V(D)J rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy or light chain (IgH or IgL) or class switch recombination (CSR) can initiate chromosomal translocations. The DNA-damage kinase ATM is required for the suppression of chromosomal translocations but ATM regulation is incompletely understood. Here, we show that mice lacking the ATM cofactor ATMIN in B cells (ATMINΔB/ΔB) have impaired ATM signaling and develop B cell lymphomas. Notably, ATMINΔB/ΔB cells exhibited defective peripheral V(D)J rearrangement and CSR, resulting in translocations involving the Igh and Igl loci, indicating that ATMIN is required for efficient repair of DNA breaks generated during somatic recombination. Thus, our results identify a role for ATMIN in regulating the maintenance of genomic stability and tumor suppression in B cells.
