Abstract: Zinc tin nitride (ZnSnN2) thin films have been deposited on glass and silicon substrates using a reactive co-sputtering process. Although the deposition temperature was limited to the room temperature, the films show a highly crystallization level and a strong preferred orientation in the [001] direction. The film composition, measured using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron probe microanalysis, indicates a possible tin understoichiometry (or a zinc and a nitrogen overstoichiometry). As confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, the main oxygen contamination of the films results from oxidation of the grains boundaries after air exposure of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Mössbauer spectrometry have been used to determine the chemical environment of atoms in the ZnSnN2 crystals. Both methods confirm that Sn4+ ions are bonded to nitrogen atoms and that the oxygen contamination results in the formation of Sn2+ ions. Zinc tin nitride exhibit an electron mobility at room temperature close to 3.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an optical band gap of 1.8 eV as measured independently from UV–visible spectrometry and ellipsometry. The results obtained in the present study confirm the suitability of ZnSnN2 thin films as an Earth abundant material for absorber layer in photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: The tungsten trioxide monohydrate (WO3·H2O) nanosheets were directly formed on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates without any guidance of seed layer by a novel and quite facile one-step citric acid-assisted hydrothermal method at low temperature (90 °C). The WO3·H2O nanosheets possess porous morphologies and good adhesion to the substrates, which would markedly increase the surface area of WO3·H2O and facilitate the ion diffusion during the electrochemical processes. The WO3·H2O nanosheets display superior electrochemical properties of large optical modulation (79.0%), fast switching time (tc = 10.1, tb = 6.1 s), high areal capacitance (43.30 mF cm–2) and excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, bridging electrochromic behavior with energy storage was successfully achieved. Based on the proposed WO3·H2O nanosheets, a smart energy storage electrode was demonstrated, which could monitor the level of stored energy by color changes. The results show great potential of the one-step synthesized WO3·H2O nanosheets for integrated electrochromism and energy storage applications.

Abstract: We investigated the thermal stability of multilayered transparent electrodes composed of ZnO:Ga (GZO)/Ag/GZO layers for the application of large-scale perovskite solar cell (PSC) modules, which require a post-annealing temperature of 450 °C. The sheet resistance and transmittance of the GZO/Ag/GZO (50 nm/12 nm/50 nm) electrodes were encouragingly improved by an annealing test with a temperature variation from 25° to 450°C. The optimum value of the sheet resistance was 4.48 Ω/square at an annealing temperature of 450 °C. By a simulation of PSC module performance, we confirmed that PSC modules with our GZO/Ag/GZO multilayered transparent electrodes (4–5 Ω/square) suffer less performance degradation compared to those with conventional FTO transparent electrodes (8–15 Ω/square).

Abstract: Given the importance that concentrating solar power technologies have had in recent years, the interaction between humid atmospheres in which SO2 is the main pollutant and the metal reflecting layers of the solar concentrators is a major concern that should be addressed. Previous durability studies have urged the importance of designing an accelerated aging test protocol for simulating aggressive industrial atmospheres that solar reflector materials are bound to encounter. Therefore, three types of reflectors were tested in an acid-rain (or Kesternich) chamber at various temperatures and gas concentrations based on the DIN 50018 and ISO 6988 standards. The results showed the significant effect of high SO2 concentrations rather than high temperatures on silvered-glass reflectors, although synergy should not be disregarded. Strong reductions in specular reflectance were found for one type of silvered reflector compared to another type, highlighting the significance of material processing and its effects on their final performance. Aluminum reflectors were not damaged as much as silvered-glass reflectors, but under microscopic inspection, a wide range of noticeable corrosion defects could be found in all the materials. Comparisons between the most representative Kesternich test and samples from an outdoor industrial site permitted realistic lifetime correlations for commercial silvered-glass reflectors.

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with mutations in EGFR frequently detected that render this receptor tyrosine kinase constantly active. Targeted therapy against EGFR has proved effective in lung cancer treatment, but secondary mutations in EGFR frequently cause drug resistance. In the efforts made to investigate alternative ways to inhibit mutant EGFR, we observed that the dynamin inhibitor dynasore effectively suppressed the exon 19-deleted mutant of EGFR. This agent inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, and cell cycle progression of HCC827 and H1650 cells driven by the exon 19-deleted EGFR mutant. From a mechanistic point of view, dynasore suppressed the activation of AKT and MEK in HCC827 and H1650 cells. However, dynasore failed to alter the subcellular distribution of EGFR, and another dynamin inhibitor, dyngo-4a, did not phenocopy the effects of dynasore, suggesting a dynamin activity-independent effect of dynasore. Finally, we show that dynasore induced the potent ubiquitylation of the exon 19-deleted mutant of EGFR. Our observations will shed light on the development of alternative therapeutic strategies that target mutant EGFR in lung cancer.

Abstract: The sulfurization of co-evaporated Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films is studied. In this work, a relationship between the Na concentration and the further S incorporation in the CZTSe absorber layer is found. Na is added by a NaF precursor layer before CZTSe co-evaporation and/or by diffusion from the soda-lime glass substrate. Higher Na concentrations result in bigger grain sizes, higher S/(S + Se) atomic ratios and photovoltaic devices with higher VOC, as investigated by SEM, GIXRD, Raman and I-V measurements. Results using an alternative substrate as ceramic verify the importance of the control of the Na content, which alters the carrier concentrations and elements distribution with much higher S and Na concentrations at the surface in this particular case. By using this methodology, it is possible to tune the kesterite band gap energy by the creation of S-gradient through the absorber thin film. This may provide a new approach for the control of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 growth and development of high efficiency kesterite solar cells. Efficiencies of 5.5% and 6.4% are obtained using ceramic and SLG substrates respectively (without antireflection coatings and without grids).

Abstract: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of gamma linolenic acid (GLA) on mitochondrial mediated death apoptosis, hypoxic microenvironment and cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway against 7, 12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) induced mammary gland carcinoma. The effects of GLA were evaluated morphologically and biochemically against DMBA induced mammary gland carcinoma. The metabolic study was done for evaluation of biomarkers using 1H NMR. The present study was also verified through immunoblotting and qRT-PCR studies for the evaluation of various pathways. GLA treatment has a delineate implementation upon morphology of the tissues when evaluated through carmine staining, hematoxyline and eosin staining and scanning electron microscopy. GLA also demarked a commendatory proclamation of the fifteen key serum metabolites analogous with amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism when recognized through1H NMR studies. The immunoblotting and qRT-PCR studies accomplished that GLA mediated mitochondrial death apoptosis, curtail hypoxic microenvironment along with hindrance of de novo fatty acid synthesis and also mediate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway to proclaim its anticancer effects.

Abstract: Poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophenes) (PXDOTs) electrochromic (EC) thin films were synthesized that exhibited novel gasochromic properties by casting catalytic platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on their surfaces. The PXDOTs cathodically colored EC films were composed of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT), poly(3,4-(2,2-dimethylpropylenedioxy) thiophene) (PProDOT-Me2), and poly(3,4-(2′,2′-diethylpropylene)-dioxythiophene) (PProDOT-Et2). All the films were obtained by electrochemical deposition on a transparent conducting substrate. The PtNPs were selected as catalytic materials coupled with hydrogen gas (H2) to reduce the PXDOTs films and showed GC properties. These films revealed significant optical transmittance changes (ΔT) when negative voltages were applied or the material was exposed to H2. The UV–vis spectra of films exposure to H2 were similar to apply voltages between − 0.3 and − 0.4 V. The PProDOT-Me2 film exhibited the highest ΔT (˃40%) and best long-term cyclic ability. By varying the casting concentration of PtNPs, the darkening times were dramatically reduced from ˃10 min to ˂1 min. Furthermore, ozone (O3) was introduced to enhance bleaching and cyclic stability. The optimized 0.5 wt% PtNPs/ PProDOT-Me2 film showed fast switching and a maximum ΔT of 50.7% during the first cycle, which was maintained after 120 cycles. The PtNPs/PXDOTs films were characterized and analyzed using cyclic voltammetry, UV–vis transmittance spectra, optical transmittance kinetic curves, surface electronic microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

Abstract: The origins of an increase in the series resistance of PERC multicrystalline silicon solar cells due to post-firing thermal processes are investigated. This effect has been shown to be capable of reducing the fill factor of finished cells by up to 20%ABS, severely degrading their performance. It is observed that electric currents applied either during or after these thermal processes can greatly alter the series resistance, either causing it to increase by more than an order of magnitude or suppressing the effect entirely. It is demonstrated that this behavior is in good agreement with the expected interactions of hydrogen with dopants and electric fields within silicon wafers. It is therefore speculated that at least part of the observed increase in resistance is due to the motion of hydrogen within the cell itself.

Abstract: This work reports on the characterization of new heat transfer fluids consisting in dispersions of functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (fGnP) in Havoline XLC Premixed 50/50 base fluid. Optical, stability and rheological properties have been considered, with the aim to assess the nano-suspension potential for volumetric direct solar absorbers. Nanoparticle addition leads to a considerably higher sunlight absorption with respect to the pure base fluid even at the investigated extremely low concentrations (0.005% and 0.05% wt). Rheology tests show a Newtonian behaviour in the shear rate range between 10 and 1000 s−1. Viscosity and thermal conductivities do not significantly increase with respect to the pure base fluid, showing that these new fluids will not require additional pumping powers to flow.

Abstract: The novel solar cell architecture called silicon homo-heterojunction (HHJ) cell is investigated combining experimental and simulation approaches. This structure intends to overcome the limitations of the silicon heterojunction technology regarding the amorphous/ crystalline silicon interface (p) a-Si:H/(i) a-Si:H /(n) c-Si) by the addition of a (p+) c-Si layer at the hetero-interface. First, the added (p+) c-Si layer is experimentally investigated using boron implantation through the realization and characterization of symmetric solar cell precursors. An adapted process flow taking into account the (p+) c-Si profile optimization, the annealing effects on substrate degradation, and the impact on surface passivation, is deeply explored. Then, large area solar cells are processed and the solar cell performance are discussed in view of the data obtained on precursors and with the help of realistic numerical simulations. Overall, we observe that the HHJ solar cells exhibit a small performance improvement compared to reference heterojunction cells. In particular, a gain in the fill factor is observed, which is shown to be originated from both an improvement in field effect and a decrease of the vertical series resistance from the a-Si:H layers. The experimental data obtained on the processed homo-heterojunction solar cells confirm that this technology can lead to improved conversion efficiencies compared to the high quality reference heterojunction solar cells.

Abstract: The objective of this study has been twofold: i) to investigate different strategies for CPV module glass surface modification, in particular preparing hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings in order to reduce the dust accumulation (soiling) on the module surface; ii) to perform a joint comparative soiling testing in Italy, Spain and Brazil in order to understand the limit and advantages of the proposed anti-soiling coatings in different climate condition. Two TiO2/SiO2 films with different titanium content have been synthesized and benchmarked against pure TiO2 in relation to transparency and hydrophilicity. Moreover, a hydrophobic antireflective material based on functionalized-SiO2 thin film was also investigated. All these coatings have been deposited over low iron float glass substrates by sol-gel dip-coating and electron-beam evaporation technique. TiO2/SiO2 and functionalized-SiO2 films showed higher transmittance in visible range than pure TiO2. TiO2/SiO2 films showed a persistent superhydrophilic character with water contact angles near to 0°, while functionalized-SiO2 presented hydrophobic property. The joint comparative soiling tests showed the importance of setting anti-soiling strategies in region characterized by more dry climate: in Brazil, which during the soiling test was characterized by a long dry period, the anti-soiling coatings were effective in reducing the soiling deposition and in the removal of the contaminants by rainwater; in Spain and Italy, the more frequent rain precipitation made the soiling effect less relevant, however, the deposition of anti-soiling coating on the module cover glass allowed to fully recover the initial transmittance after rain washing. A chemical and mineral characterization of the soiling has been carried out revealing the dependence of the contaminants from the environment conditions (e.g. car traffic, presence of industries, amount of rain and local minerals in the ground).

Abstract: Components for concentrating solar power applications can suffer from optical performance loss due to their permanent exposure to the environment. There is still lack of experience regarding the destructive effects of sand- and duststorms on glass envelope materials for receiver tubes of parabolic-trough collectors for concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. So far no accelerated aging guideline is formulated yet to account for the performance loss of optical components due to particle erosion to a realistic extent. Within this study 4 different anti-reflective (AR) coatings deposited on borosilicate glass are subjected to an artificial sandstorm test and their resistance towards erosion is evaluated. An uncoated borosilicate glass is also tested as reference. Noticeable differences were obtained depending on the type of coating. Microscope analysis and light transmission measurements in the spectrophotometer were undertaken and it could be concluded that the selection of an AR coating should not only be based on the initial optical performance but also in accordance with meteorological data, especially when erosive sandstorms are expected for the chosen site of the CSP plant.

Abstract: The endocannabinoid (eCB) system plays a key role in many physiological and pathological conditions and its dysregulation has been described in several rheumatological and autoimmune diseases. Yet, its possible alteration in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has never been investigated. Here, we aimed filling this gap in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and age- and sex- matched healthy subjects (HS). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry quantitation of eCB levels highlighted that plasma levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) were significantly increased in SLE patients compared to HS (p = 0.0059), and among SLE patients, highest 2-AG levels were associated with a lower disease activity. No differences were found in N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and its congeners N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) and N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA) concentrations between the two groups. Moreover, gene expression analysis of metabolic enzymes and receptor targets of eCBs and investigation of functional activity and protein expression of selected components of eCB system disclosed a deranged 2-AG metabolism in patients with SLE. Indeed, expression and functional activity of 2-AG biosynthetic enzyme DAGL were selectively enhanced in PBMCs of SLE patients compared to HS. In conclusion, our results demonstrate, for the first time, an alteration of eCB system in SLE patients. They represents the first step toward the understanding of the role of eCB system in SLE that likely suggest DAGL and 2-AG as potential biomarkers of SLE in easily accessible blood samples. Our data provides proof-of-concept to the development of cannabis-based medicine as immune-modulating agents.

Abstract: In this work, by introducing Cu dopant, ultra-thin Ag transparent conductive films were prepared on glass and PET substrates without seed layers. The percolation threshold thickness for the Cu doped Ag thin films was as low as 6 nm with a RMS roughness only 0.19 nm. The prepared 6 nm Cu doped Ag thin films, Ag(Cu), had a transmittance of 80% at 550 nm and a sheet resistance of 14.1 Ω sq−1. The Ag(Cu) thin films revealed excellent thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Flexible polymer solar cells using the Ag(Cu) electrode reached a convert efficiency of 7.53% with a very thin PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer. The proposed ultra-thin alloy transparent conductive films are ease of fabrication and beneficial to light harvesting, which are promising for large-area applications in flexible photovoltaics.

Abstract: Because of the ability to utilize the low-grade solar thermal energy for regeneration, a CO2 capture system characterized by solar-assisted pressure temperature swing adsorption (SOL-PTSA) is studied on the effects of adsorbent materials. A detailed cycle description is firstly presented within the diagram of adsorption isotherm for the energy-efficiency analysis. Typical adsorbent materials, including zeolites and chemical adsorbent, are assessed in terms of sensible heat and latent heat, etc. Then, the energy consumption and the second-law efficiency, which can be considered as lumped indicators from such material parameters, are chosen as performance indicators as well. The influence of separation temperature, desorption temperature, CO2 concentration and CO2 adsorption pressure on system performance are finally obtained. For the chosen three adsorbent materials, the energy consumption of SOL-PTSA system is at the range of 25.96–87.76 kJ/mol, and the corresponding second-law efficiencies are at the range of 9.18–26.89%. The effect of adsorbent materials on the energy-efficiency of SOL-PTSA system mainly depends on specific heat, CO2 working capacity and cycle design. In addition, the integration options of solar energy into PTSA technology are also discussed from the standpoint of the utilization of solar grade heat due to two energy loads required for PTSA's operation.

Abstract: Electron transport medium (ETM) is one of the most important components determining the photovoltaic performance of organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Among the metal oxide semiconductors, anatase (TiO2) is the most common material used as ETM in PSCs to facilitate charge collection as well as to support a thin perovskite absorber layer. Production of conductive crystalline TiO2 requires relatively higher temperatures (400–500 °C) which limits its application to glass substrates coated with fluorine tin oxide (FTO) as other tin oxides (e.g. indium tin oxide) degrade at temperatures above 300 °C. Furthermore, this renders it unsuitable for flexible devices, often based on low-temperature flexible plastic substrates. Pure tin oxide, one of the earliest metal oxide semiconductors, is often used in myriad electronic devices and has shown outstanding characteristics as an ETM in PSC systems. Thus, tin oxide can be considered a viable alternative to TiO2 due to its excellent electron mobility and higher stability than other alternatives such as zinc oxide. This review article gives a brief history of ETMs in PSC systems and reviews recent developments in the use of tin oxide in both pure and composite form as ETMs. Efficiencies of up to 21% have been reported in tin oxide based PSCs with photovoltages of up to ~1214 mV.

Abstract: Hot corrosion behavior of three commercial alloys (stainless steel SS 310, Incoloy 800 H, Hastelloy C-276) in molten MgCl2/NaCl/KCl (60/20/20 mol%) under inert atmosphere was investigated by immersion tests at 700 °C for 500 h. SS 310 exhibited the highest corrosion rate, while Hastelloy C-276 showed the best corrosion resistance. All the studied alloys could not meet the requirements for commercial application (i.e., corrosion rate < 10 µm/year for 30 year's lifetime). Microstructural analysis on the exposed alloy specimens using SEM, EDX and XRD shows that Cr was dissolved preferentially than Fe and Ni to form a corrosion layer with a porous structure during the corrosion. Moreover, the corrosion products (e.g., MgO, MgCr2O4, etc.) precipitated on the surface of the exposed specimens, as well as in the pores of the Cr-depleted corrosion layer. For SS 310 containing 2 wt% Si, Si was also dissolved and corrosion products containing Si were observed in the pores of the corrosion layer. Based on these findings, an impurity-driven corrosion mechanism is proposed to describe the hot corrosion behavior of the studied alloys in molten MgCl2/NaCl/KCl under inert atmosphere, which could assist the development of corrosion mitigation technologies in future work.

Abstract: Electrospray (ES) has emerged as an attractive approach to fabricate thin-film organic photovoltaic devices. However, the morphological properties and their implication to electrical characteristics of polymer:fullerene blends deposited by this method have not been clearly understood yet. In order to uncover the interplay of nanoscale morphology and electrical properties of ES-deposited films, both the residues of single droplets and thin films from the overlapping of multiple droplets were investigated by various characterization techniques. The surface morphology was demonstrated in details by the optical microscope (OM) and atom force microscope (AFM). The ordering structures and aggregation of the polymer were identified by the Raman and UV–vis spectroscopic investigations. The spatially distribution map of the P3HT aggregation states was analyzed by fitting the C˭C mode of P3HT with Lorentzian functions. The conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) was used to quantify local currents and reveal the correlation between the nanostructure and charge-transport mobility. Both surface morphology and aggregation of the P3HT were found to strongly depend on the overlapping boundaries formed by the dry residues of individual droplets. More P3HT aggregation present at the boundaries. However, boundaries also show significantly higher charge-transport resistance thus lower current. Thin films deposited with less droplet evaporation exhibit more homogenous morphology, more uniform phase segregation, and consequently higher charge mobility.

Abstract: We report on the production of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) dispersion with high–concentration mixed-solvent strategy. The MoS2 and WS2 thin films are processed by liquid exfoliation which has advantages for residue-free, large-scale, and low-cost in TMDCs film fabrication. Various thicknesses of TMDCs films are prepared and controlled by a centrifuge process for the photovoltaic applications (5 × 5 mm scale) with gold/TMDCs/silicon/indium geometry. Based on ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurement results, the energy band diagram of the devices using MoS2 and WS2 films can be constructed. The external quantum efficiency and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MoS2 and WS2 devices are measured with different film thicknesses. The 126–nm-thick MoS2 and 132–nm-thick WS2 film devices show the maximum PCEs of 3.55% and 2.98%, respectively, under 100 mW cm−2 solar illumination. Thus, we demonstrate potential of MoS2 and WS2 films in photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: For almost sixty years, solar energy for space applications has relied on inorganic photovoltaics, evolving from solar cells made of single crystalline silicon to triple junctions based on germanium and III-V alloys. The class of organic-based photovoltaics, which ranges from all-organic to hybrid perovskites, has the potential of becoming a disruptive technology in space applications, thanks to the unique combination of appealing intrinsic properties (e.g. record high specific power, tunable absorption window) and processing possibilities. Here, we report on the launch of the stratospheric mission OSCAR, which demonstrated for the first time organic-based solar cell operation in extra-terrestrial conditions. This successful maiden flight for organic-based photovoltaics opens a new paradigm for solar electricity in space, from satellites to orbital and planetary space stations.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare the optical and electrical performance of different Fresnel-based HCPV systems equipped with different refractive secondary optical elements (SOEs) through both optical modelling and experiments. The SOEs (designed with a thorough optical modelling): i) Dielectric-cross compound-parabolic-concentrator (DCCPC), ii) (SIngle-Lens-Optical element) SILO-Pyramid, iii) Refractive truncated pyramid (RTP) and, iv) Trumpet; are fabricated (made of PMMA) and mounted on commercially available concentrator solar cell assemblies. An indoor characterisation of all these HCPV units, under controlled conditions, using a CPV Solar Simulator “Helios 3198” is performed. The angular behaviour of the HCPV units is predicted properly, in general, although the measured optical efficiencies result in lower values than in the optical simulations. The reasons for those differences are explored through some fabrication and mounting imperfections detected, among others. The impact of changed irradiance and spectrum is analysed separately. No high dependence in the efficiency or in the acceptance angle, in terms of the maximum power point, was found due to changes in the irradiance. For changed spectral conditions, the decrease in the fill factor results in up to around 4% lower than the maximum values. Moreover, the impact of the spectrum on the acceptance angle was analysed. The results showed an increment of the power-based acceptance angle for blue-rich spectra for the HCPV units with SOEs working as light pipes. From the results of efficiency and acceptance angle, none of the SOEs produces a notably performance than the others.

Abstract: Background and objectives
Edaravone is a new type of oxygen free radical scavenger and able to attenuate various brain damage including hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD). This study was aimed at investigating the neuroprotective mechanism of edaravone in rat hypoxic-ischemic brain damage model and its correlation with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) signaling pathway.
Materials and methods
75 seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley neonatal rats were equally divided into three groups: sham-operated group (sham), HIBD group and HIBD rats injected with edaravone (HIBD + EDA) group. Neurological severity and space cognitive ability of rats in each group were evaluated using Longa neurological severity score and Morris water maze testing. TUNEL assay and flow cytometry were used to determine brain cell apoptosis. Western blot was used to estimate the expression level of death receptor-5 (DR5), Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), caspase 8, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax). In addition, immunofluorescence was performed to detect caspase 3.
Results
Edaravone reduced neurofunctional damage caused by HIBD and improved the cognitive capability of rats. The above experiment results suggested that edaravone could down-regulate the expression of active caspase 3 protein, thereby relieving neuronal apoptosis.
Conclusion
Taken together, edaravone could attenuate neuronal apoptosis in rat hypoxic-ischemic brain damage model via suppression of TRAIL signaling pathway, which also suggested that edaravone might be an effective therapeutic strategy for HIBD clinical treatment.

Abstract: Aging has been linked to several degenerative processes that, through the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage, can progressively lead to cell dysfunction and organ failure. Human aging is linked with a higher risk for individuals to develop cancer, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders. The understanding of the molecular basis of aging and associated diseases has been one major challenge of scientific research over the last decades. Mitochondria, the center of oxidative metabolism and principal site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, are crucial both in health and in pathogenesis of many diseases. Redox signaling is important for the modulation of cell functions and several studies indicate a dual role for ROS in cell physiology. In fact, high concentrations of ROS are pathogenic and can cause severe damage to cell and organelle membranes, DNA, and proteins. On the other hand, moderate amounts of ROS are essential for the maintenance of several biological processes, including gene expression. In this review, we provide an update regarding the key roles of ROS–mitochondria cross talk in different fundamental physiological or pathological situations accompanying aging and highlighting that mitochondrial ROS may be a decisive target in clinical practice.

Abstract: The vast majority of conventional photovoltaic (PV) module technologies suffer from inactive areas, for example, due to the front contact finger grids or interconnection lines, which are essential for efficient extraction of the photocurrent. Invisibility cloaking by freeform surfaces is a new concept to guide incident light of the entire solar spectrum and all angles of incidence away from these inactive areas to the active areas of the PV modules. In this work, a freeform surface design is incorporated into a standard encapsulation layer of conventionally front glass covered PV modules. For a copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film PV module, a relative improvement in power conversion efficiency of 6.5% is presented, which demonstrates that the entire optical losses of the inactive area can be recovered. The design of the freeform surface is optimized based on rigorous ray-tracing simulations, which further allow discriminating and quantifying the underlying optical effects. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the scalability of the freeform surface cloak, a prototype CIGS thin-film PV module (comprised of nine monolithically interconnected solar cells) exhibiting fully-cloaked interconnection lines is presented.

Hepatitis B virus X protein and proinflammatory cytokines synergize to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells by upregulation of DR4,

Abstract: Persistent infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) may lead to HBV-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN). Presence of HBV-DNA and -RNA in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) suggests direct virus-induced injury. Increase in proinflammatory cytokines is also observed under these conditions. Apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of HBV-infections. However, the effects of HBV X protein (HBx) on TRAIL-induced apoptosis of RTECs especially under certain inflammatory conditions remain obscure. Here, we show that HBx synergizes with proinflammatory cytokines to significantly increase TRAIL-induced apoptosis of RTECs. HBx markedly up-regulates death receptor-4 (DR4) expression by enhancing the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines. Dramatic increase in DR4 expression leads to the sensitization of RTECs to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in patients with HBV-GN, DR4 expression in the kidneys is significantly elevated and is positively correlated with the HBx and proinflammatory cytokines expression. These findings provide a novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of renal tubule lesions induced by HBx in HBV-GN.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a form of minority carrier degradation on n-type Cz silicon that affects both the bulk and surface related lifetimes. We identify three key behaviors of the degradation mechanism; 1) a firing dependence for the extent of degradation, 2) the appearance of bulk degradation when wafers are fired in the presence of a diffused emitter and 3) a firing related apparent surface degradation when wafers are fired in the absence of an emitter. We further report a defect capture cross-section ratio of σn/σp = 0.028 ± 0.003 for the defect in n-type. Utilizing our understanding of light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID) in p-type silicon, we demonstrate that the degradation behaviors in both n-type and p-type silicon are closely correlated. In light of numerous reports on the involvement of hydrogen, the potential role of a hydrogen-induced degradation mechanism is discussed in both p- and n-type silicon, particularly in relation to the diffusion of hydrogen and influence of hydrogen-dopant interactions.

Abstract: We report thin-film InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) solar cells with n−i−p+ deep junction structure and planar back reflector fabricated by epitaxial lift-off (ELO) of full 3-in wafers. External quantum efficiency measurements demonstrate twofold enhancement of the QD photocurrent in the ELO QD cell compared to the wafer-based QD cell. In the GaAs wavelength range, the ELO QD cell perfectly preserves the current collection efficiency of the baseline single-junction ELO cell. We demonstrate by full-wave optical simulations that integrating a micro-patterned diffraction grating in the ELO cell rearside provides more than tenfold enhancement of the near-infrared light harvesting by QDs. Experimental results are thoroughly discussed with the help of physics-based simulations to single out the impact of QD dynamics and defects on the cell photovoltaic behavior. It is demonstrated that non radiative recombination in the QD stack is the bottleneck for the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the reported devices. More important, our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Voc offset of 0.3V from the QD ground state identified by Tanabe et al., 2012, from a collection of experimental data of high quality III-V QD solar cells is a reliable – albeit conservative – metric to gauge the attainable Voc and to quantify the scope for improvement by reducing non radiative recombination. Provided that material quality issues are solved, we demonstrate – by transport and rigorous electromagnetic simulations – that light-trapping enhanced thin-film cells with twenty InAs/GaAs QD layers reach efficiency higher than 28% under unconcentrated light, ambient temperature. If photon recycling can be fully exploited, 30% efficiency is deemed to be feasible.

Abstract: High-performance multicrystalline silicon (HPMC-Si) wafers were produced using upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) materials in the seed-assisted growth system at the industrial scale. The HPMC-Si wafers yielded low dislocation density and fine and uniform grain size. We observed that fine grain size suppressed the segregation effect of metal impurities. The effective segregation coefficients of Fe, Al, and total metal impurities approximated 0.265, 0.492, and 0.386, respectively. The concentration of impurities within 10–90% of the solidified fraction in the ingot was relatively uniform based on the improved crystal structure control. The heterogeneous nucleation mechanism of concave and planocera nucleation was discussed intensively. HPMC-Si wafers were obtained under the crystal structure control coupled with behavior regulation of impurity segregation in the seed-assisted growth system. The average conversion efficiency of Al-BSF processed solar cells reached 18.65%.

Abstract: In this paper, we designed a series of well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays decorated with loading-controllable Au nanoparticles and studied their surface plasmon-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performances. The PEC water splitting ability of Au-ZnO nanorod arrays was evaluated under illumination with λ > 420 nm light. These nanorod arrays show remarkable PEC water splitting performances and achieve the highest photocurrent density of 30 μA cm−2 at 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl. Furthermore, the PEC performance for heterogenous nanorod arrays can be effectively adjusted by controlling loading amounts of Au nanoparticles. We experimentally demonstrate that the Au-ZnO nanorod arrays show enhanced visible light absorption ability. The superior PEC performance of Au-ZnO nanorod arrays is attributed to the synergistic effects of plasmonic Au nanoparticles, ZnO semiconductor and Schottky barrier built in heterogenous nanorod array. This work provides a facile strategy to manipulate the PEC water splitting activity of Au-ZnO hybrid nanostructures by simply controlling the loading amounts of metallic Au nanoparticles. Furthermore, our research offers a potentially efficient strategy for the design and fabrication of new types of plasmonic-metal/semiconductor hybrid nanostructures with a plasmonic-enhanced PEC water splitting activity under the visible light, which are as valuable photocatalysts for solar-to-chemical/electrical energy conversion.

Abstract: A lack of efficient crystallization methods and the metastability of supercooled liquids have limited the use of supercooling phase change materials (PCMs) in long-term thermal energy storage (LTES). Here, we propose a new supercooling PCM-polymer mixture that is not prone to spontaneous crystallization during the storage period. The material releases the stored thermal energy by cold-crystallization on re-heating. The PCM-polymer mixture is composed of supercooling polyol (erythritol or D-mannitol) dispersed in a cross-linked sodium polyacrylate (PAANa) matrix. PAANa efficiently prevents the conventional cooling crystallization of the PCM. Instead of crystallization, the melt polyol supercools and eventually vitrifies as an amorphous solid. Deeply supercooled or vitrified polyol is stable against crystallization below its cold-crystallization temperature. The heat charged and discharged remained similar in 100 repeated melting-crystallization cycles. Its good long-term performance and the stability of the supercooled polyol-PAANa against crystallization at low temperatures make the new material extremely promising for LTES.

Abstract: Cancerous cells show resistance to various forms of therapy, so applying up to the minute targeted therapy is crucial. For this purpose, long non-coding RNA PVT1 as shown by recent studies is an important oncogene that interacts with vital cellular signaling pathways and different proteins such as c-Myc, NOP2 and LATS2. Due to the enormous role of long non-coding RNAs in development of leukemias, we aimed to show the role of PVT1 knock-down on fate of different hematologic cell lines. owing to this matter, various experiments such as Real-time PCR, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay were performed. Meanwhile, proliferation rate by CFSE, protein expression of c-Myc and hTERT by western blot and flow cytometry analysis were investigated. Our results demonstrated that PVT1 knock-down results in c-Myc degradation, proliferation down-regulation, induction of apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest. Simultaneously, for the first time, we posited the relation between this oncogene with hTERT that reduced after PVT1 knock-down. Considering these results, long non-coding RNA PVT1 may be a potential option for targeted therapy in hematologic malignancies.

Abstract: Single layer coatings of hafnium carbide were deposited on stainless steel, copper and silicon substrates by means of reactive sputtering. The deposition process was optimized for maximum solar absorptance by varying the process parameters. In the case of coated stainless steel substrates, we obtained a maximum solar absorptance of 0.925 along with a thermal emittance of 0.13. For coated copper substrates we obtained a maximum solar absorptance of 0.948 along with a thermal emittance of 0.03. Reflectance spectra of SS and Cu substrates coated at optimized parameters were measured in the wavelength range 250 nm to 20 µm. Detailed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out to investigate the chemical composition of the coatings. XPS analysis of coated samples showed that because of the tendency of HfC to oxidize, the coating had a surface consisting mostly of HfO2 but the extent of oxidation reduced with depth and partially oxidized HfC was present on the subsurface layers of the coatings. Along with the absorbing nature of HfC and appropriate coating thickness, the high solar absorptance of the coating can be partially attributed to the presence of HfO2 near the surface which acts similar to an antireflection layer. Assuming a two-layer model of the coating, an upper HfO2 layer and a HfC layer underneath it, reflectance spectra of the coated samples were simulated using SCOUT software and compared to the experimentally obtained spectra. For all the samples, best fit values of coating thicknesses were in the range 120–130 nm.

Abstract: Heterojunction solar cells based on molybdenum sub-oxide (MoOx) deposited on n-type crystalline silicon have been fabricated. The hole selective character of MoOx is explained by its high workfunction, which causes a strong band bending in the Si substrate. This bending pushes the surface into inversion. In addition, the sub-stoichiometry of the evaporated MoOx layers leads to a high density of states within the bandgap. This is crucial for charge transport. The J-V electrical characteristics at several temperatures were analysed to elucidate the dominant charge transport mechanisms of this heterojunction structure. We have identified two different transport mechanisms. At low bias voltage, transport is dominated by hole tunnelling through the MoOx gap states. At higher voltage the behaviour is similar to a Schottky junction with a high barrier value, due to the high MoOx work function. These results provide a better understanding of the hole selective character of MoOx/n-type silicon heterocontacts, which is key to further improve this new kind of solar cells.

Abstract: CdSe nanocrystal (NC) thin films of different NC sizes were synthesized using vacuum deposition technique. The films showed blue shift of band gap and the NC sizes calculated size using Brus equation were 9.40, 9.68 and 9.82nm. DC conductivity and photoconductivity of as-deposited and annealed films increased and activation energy for conduction decreased with increase in the NC size. Also, both carrier concentration and mobility of the films increased with increase in the size of the NCs which was attributed to the increased electronic coupling between the NCs. The slow response part of photocurrent response pulse analyzed using power law: Iph ∞ tα gave larger values for α for larger NC size indicating stronger electronic coupling between grains in films of larger grain sizes. Charge transport in the CdSe NC films was akin to that of solid films of CdSe quantum dots, of sizes given by Brus equation, connected together by an outer shell of CdSe material where charge carriers had free movement. Additionally, measurement of the characteristics of the hetero-junction formed by the CdSe NC film with a similarly deposited Cu2Se film demonstrated usefulness of the CdSe NC films synthesized using the present technique for practical applications.

Abstract: Solar energy materials have properties that are tailored to the characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation in our natural surroundings, specifically its spectral distribution, angle of incidence and intensity. This tailoring can be made with regard to solar irradiation, thermal emission, atmospheric absorption, visible light, photosynthetic efficiency and more. Solar energy materials can be of many kinds, e.g., metallic, semiconducting, dielectric, glassy, polymeric, gaseous, etc. In particular, thin surface coatings of solar energy materials may exhibit the desired properties in their own right or may yield such properties when backed by an appropriate substrate. This article surveys a number of topics related to thermal applications such as solar thermal converters, transparent thermal insulators, devices for radiative cooling by exposure to the clear sky, and windows and glass facades with static or dynamic properties. The purpose of the present paper is to provide a bird's eye view over a wide class of materials of rising importance rather than giving detailed accounts of highly specialized topics.

Abstract: Though very promising, fatty acids suffer from low thermal conductivity and leakage, which limits their heat storage applications. To overcome these problems, we used silica fume (SF) to house the fatty acid and prevent leaching during phase change and incorporated different amount (1.0, 3.0 and 5.0wt%) of CNTs to improve the thermal conductivity to the desired level. For the experimental temperature range and better performance an eutectic mixture of capric acid(CA)-palmitic acid(PA) was prepared and investigated. The physicochemical and morphological characterizations of the fabricated shape stabilized-composite PCMs (SS-CPCMs) with/without CNTs were carried out using FTIR, XRD and SEM instruments. The DSC analysis results showed the SS-CPCMs had phase change temperatures of 19–26°C and high latent heat capacity of 46–49J/g, which are suitable for thermal energy storage (TES) in buildings. The SS-CPCMs showed good cycling TES reliability and chemical stability and also exhibited excellent thermal durability up to 140°C. The CNTs doping process caused an appreciable increase in thermal conductivity and significantly reduced the charging and discharging times of the SS-CPCMs. Consequently, due to higher thermal conductivity, the SS-CPCM doped with 5.0wt% CNTs can be considered as more promising composite for passive solar thermoregulation of building envelopes.

Abstract: Monolithic solar water splitting devices implemented in an integrated design approach, i.e. submerged in the electrolyte, pose a significant limitation when it comes to up-scaling. The ion transport distances around the monolith are long and consequently, the ionic Ohmic losses become high. This fact turns out to be a bottleneck for reaching high device efficiency and maintaining optimum performance upon up-scaling. In this paper, we propose a new device design for integrated monolithic solar water splitting based on porous multi-junction silicon solar cells. Simulation results highlight that porous monoliths can benefit from lower ionic Ohmic losses compared to dense monoliths for various pore geometries and monolith thicknesses. In particular, we show how micrometer scale pore dimensions could greatly reduce Ohmic losses, thereby minimizing overpotentials. A square array of holes with a diameter of 20 µm and a period of 100 µm was fabricated on single-junction and multi-junction amorphous and microcrystalline silicon solar cells. A small impact on the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) was obtained, with porous triple junction solar cells reaching Voc values up to 1.98 V. A novel device design is proposed based on porous triple-junction silicon-based solar cells.

Abstract: The present studies have identified that microRNAs function as regulators in different diseases including cancers. However, the expression patterns and underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-208a involved in gastric cancer (GC) remain little known. In the study, our results demonstrated that miR-208a expression was significantly increased in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues by performing qRT-PCR. Higher miR-208a expression was association with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in GC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis verified that patients with higher miR-208a expression were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) time. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis, TNM stage and higher miR-208a were independent risks factors of OS time. Ectopic expression of miR-208a by treatment with miR-208a mimic promoted cell proliferation and invasion abilities, but downregulation of miR-208a by treatment with miR-208a inhibitor had an opposite effects. Furthermore, we identified specific targeting sites for miR-208a in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the SFRP1 gene by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Upregulation of MiR-208a promoted cell proliferation and invasion by suppressing SFRP1 expression in GC cells. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that miR-208a targeted MEG3 and negatively regulated MEG3 expression in GC cells. Thus, these data indicated that miR-208a promoted GC progression by targeting SFRP1 and negatively regulating MEG3, which may be a potential therapeutic target of GC.

Abstract: Objective
The experiments were conducted to prove that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) alleviates traumatic brain injury (TBI) through regulating TLR4/NF-Kappa B signaling pathway.
Methods
Bioinformatic analysis was performed using published data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to investigate differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury rat model was built, and DHA (16 mg/kg in DMSO, once each day) was used to treat TBI rats. Neurological severity score (NSS) and beam walking test and rotarod test were used to confirm whether DHA is neuron-protective against TBI. The expression of TLR4, NF-Kappa B p65, (TNF)-α and IL-1β were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot. The impact of DHA on neurocyte apoptosis was validated by TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. The influence of DHA on CD11b and GFAP expression in the hippocampus was determined through immunohistochemical analysis.
Results
TLR4/NF Kappa B pathway was suggested to be closely correlated with TBI by bioinformatic analysis. DHA could improve the neurological function and learning and memory ability of rats after TBI as well as promote neurocytes from apoptosis. TLR4 expression and the expression of inflammatory mediator NF-Kappa B were also repressed by DHA treatment.
Conclusions
DHA exerted a neuron-protective influence in a rat model of TBI via repressing TLR4/NF-Kappa B pathway.

Abstract: Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) materials have shown high potential in many optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications due to their intriguing semiconducting properties. Most noticeably, the layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has drawn much attention because of its unique layer-dependent band gap tunability and high electron mobility. A facile non-vacuum electrodeposition approach is used to deposit bulk MoS2 films onto FTO substrate immersed in an aqueous precursor solution of molybdenum and sulfur. The as-deposited and post-treated films are studied using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, light absorption measurement, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Although the obtained gap energy values, 1.3–1.4 eV, of bulk MoS2 are indirect, the measured light absorption characteristic is high, especially above 1.7 eV. Also, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies of the films show that carrier concentration in higher than 1015 cm−3.

Abstract: Electrodynamic dust shield (EDS) uses traveling-wave or standing-wave electrodynamic effects to repel dust particles from a surface, and has been proposed as a potential anti-dust solution for mitigating soiling loss in solar energy applications. In this study, a standing-wave EDS technique was tested in a cyclic manner at field-relevant dust loading levels using dust deposited by aerosol deposition, in order to assess the EDS’ dust removal efficiency under simulated real-world operating conditions. Tests using sieve deposition and the single-operation mode were also carried out for comparison. Each single-operation test only used freshly-deposited dust with a single activation of the EDS, and the results showed that the dust removal efficiency with aerosol deposition to be moderately lower than that with sieve deposition. In contrast, a cyclic-operation test consisted of many consecutive cycles, which began with the first cycle using freshly-deposited dust, and each additional cycle having new dust added on top of the persistent dust from the previous cycle. The cyclic-operation dust removal efficiency was found to be strongly dependent on the dust deposition method. Using aerosol deposition, the cyclic-operation efficiency continually decreased as the number of cycles increased; with sieve deposition, the cyclic-operation EDS efficiency fluctuated and had a much higher average value than with aerosol deposition. The different behaviors of the cyclic-operation EDS efficiency can be modeled with two hypothetical scenarios, based on how the persistent dust from a previous cycle reacts to EDS activation. However, the physical mechanisms behind the different behaviors are not well understood. The results from this study suggest that further research is critically needed for evaluating the effectiveness of electrodynamic anti-dust solutions for solar energy applications in dusty environments.

Abstract: Hybrid solar photovoltaic/thermal power systems offer the possibility of dispatchable, low-cost, efficient and reliable solar electricity production. A key design strategy capable of fully exploiting the heat generation stemming from both solar cell thermalization and sub-bandgap photons involves an integrated photovoltaic/thermal absorber operated under concentrated sunlight, at temperatures conducive to efficient turbine operation, to wit, hundreds of degrees C. A pivotal aim is attaining the highest efficiency possible while ensuring a substantial fraction of the total power derives from the turbines, with gas-fired backup heating and/or thermal storage mitigating the ephemeral character of solar availability. However, the performance of solar cells at unprecedented elevated temperatures remains an open question. Key issues include (a) whether the efficiency loss stemming from high-temperature solar cell operation can be maintained acceptably small, as well as how optical concentration affects it, and (b) whether the solar thermal contribution can constitute a significant fraction of total electricity production. Here, we try to establish upper bounds on photovoltaic and system performance, covering a broad range of cell temperature and concentration levels, for single- and multi-junction cells operating at the radiative limit. We demonstrate that (1) the use of highly concentrated sunlight markedly diminishes photovoltaic - as well as thermal - efficiency losses at high temperature, and (2) the extent to which high operating temperature affects cell efficiency strongly depends on cell architecture. The implications for future generations of high-temperature/high-concentration solar cells are also addressed.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility and attractiveness of combining an ultra-thin atomic layer deposited aluminium oxide (ALD-AlOx) tunnel oxide layer with a commercially available low cost doped organic capping layer with high workfunction, PEDOT:PSS, to form an excellent hole-selective passivated contact for solar cell applications. We present a systematic methodology of measuring the most important parameters, i.e. determining the passivation quality (the saturation current density) and the contact resistance for our investigated hole-selective passivated contacts, and incorporating those into our developed solar cell efficiency potential prediction model to assess their performance at the final device level. In particular, we had studied in detail the impact of the choice of a suitable tunnel layer (ALD-AlOx, as compared to a “standard” wet-chemically formed wet-SiOx tunnel layer), the impact of tunnel layer thickness and tunnel layer anneal conditions (no-anneal, ambient anneal, forming gas anneal, fast-firing), as well as the influence of different capping layers (PEDOT:PSS, as compared to a “standard” p+-poly-Si capping layer) on the extracted parameters. Due to its high negative interface charges, it is advantageous to use an ultra-thin ALD-AlOx tunnel oxide instead of a commonly reported wet-SiOx tunnel oxide for hole carrier extraction. Combining that with either a highly p-doped poly-silicon capping layer or a commercially available low cost, high workfunction, doped organic capping layer like PEDOT:PSS, it is possible to achieve a practical cell efficiency potential exceeding 21%, if integrating the tunnel layer passivated hole contact at the rear-side of an otherwise conventionally processed solar cell.

Abstract: Performance enhancement of flexible transparent conductive Cu-based Al-doped ZnO (AZO) multilayer thin films has been achieved by fence engineering of graphene film. The multilayers show the excellent performance (figure of merit of 3.38 × 10−2 Ω−1, commutation quality factor of 430): sheet resistance of 4.37 Ω/sq., resistivity of 3.98 × 10−5 Ω cm, and average transmittance of above 82% in the visible range, which are the highest values obtained up to now in the flexible transparent conductive films. The commutation quality factor is about four times larger than that of indium tin oxide, the most widely used flexible transparent conductive films today. To assess the application potentials, flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) are achieved, whose efficiency is 4.63%, which is increased by 95% and 26% compared with the reference FOSCs used a conventional ITO and Cu-based AZO multilayer electrodes, respectively.

Abstract: Osteopontin (OPN) is a chemokine-like extracellular matrix-associated protein involved in the migration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). An increasing number of studies have found that chromatin organization may affect cellular migration. However, whether OPN regulates chromatin organization is not understood, nor are the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the link between chromatin organization and BMSC migration and demonstrated that OPN-mediated BMSC migration leads to elevated levels of heterochromatin marker histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) through the methyltransferase EZH2. The expression of EZH2 reorganizes the chromatin structure of BMSCs. Pharmacological inhibition or depletion of EZH2 blocks BMSC migration. Moreover, using an atomic force microscope (AFM), we found that chromatin decondensation alters the mechanical properties of the nucleus. In addition, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signals represses OPN-promoted chromatin condensation and cell migration. Thus, our results identify a mechanism by which ERK1/2 signalling drives specific chromatin modifications in BMSCs, which alters chromatin organization and thereby enables OPN-mediated BMSC migration.

Abstract: Iron is an essential element for neuronal as well as cellular functions. However, Iron overload has been known to cause neuronal toxicity through mitochondrial fission, dysregulation of Ca2+, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of iron-induced oxidative stress and mitochondria- and ER-related iron toxicity in neuronal cells are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that iron overload induces ROS production earlier in the ER than in the mitochondria, and peroxiredoxin 5 (Prx5), which is a kind of antioxidant induced by iron overload, prevents iron overload-induced mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by contact with ER and translocation of Drp1, by inhibiting ROS production and calcium/calcineurin pathway in HT-22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. Moreover, Prx5 also prevented iron overload-induced ER-stress and cleavage of caspase-3, which consequently attenuated neuronal cell death. Therefore, we suggested that iron overload induces oxidative stress in the ER earlier than in the mitochondria, thereby increasing ER stress and calcium levels, and consequently causing mitochondrial fragmentation and neuronal cell death. So we thought that this study is essential for understanding iron toxicity in neurons, and Prx5 may serve as a new therapeutic target to prevent iron overload-induced diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Photovoltaic device requires light-absorbing materials that are highly efficient, low cost, lightweight, and stable during operation. Here we demonstrate the use of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) top cell and a crystal silicon heterojunction (HIT) bottom cell to form a double-junction solar cell with a high open circuit voltage (VOC), which is potentially functioned in the solar-to-hydrogen generation process and the replacement of chemical battery. Our photovoltaic device shows a high overall VOC of 1.561 V and a short current density of over 14 mA/cm2, which outperforms all other reported pure silicon-based double-junction solar cells. The newly developed a-Si:H/HIT double-junction solar cells hold the promise for some potential applications.

Abstract: Solar selective colored chromium oxide coatings were prepared on the SS304 substrate through the electrochemical deposition route to provide more options and flexibility in aesthetically design solar absorbers with acceptable energy performance. The variation of colors in the coatings was achieved by varying the coating thickness as a function of deposition time. Color changes in the coatings were also evident in the samples that were annealed under vacuum. Electron microscopic images show that nanometer sized pores are present on the coating surfaces. The pore-density, pore-size distribution and surface roughness exhibit significant changes with variations in deposition time and annealing temperature. Initially, the selectivity factor of 6.08 was recorded in the as prepared sample coated for 30 min, which improved to 7.36 on annealing the samples under vacuum at 700 °C, however, it drops to 4.22 when annealed at 900 °C. A similar trend was also observed for samples that are coated for 60 min. The results indicate that the pore-density, pore-size distribution and surface roughness play a dominant role in governing the solar selectivity of the coatings. Nanoindentation tests were performed on the coated samples and the results show that mechanical properties of the solar absorber coatings degrades with the increase in coating thickness but improve significantly with increase in annealing temperature.

Abstract: Water evaporation, a promising and environmentally friendly technology driven by local hot spots on the water-air interface, is an efficient way to utilize solar energy. Herein, we present a novel laminar solar absorber consisting of graphite powder (GP) and a semipermeable collodion membrane (SCM) as an integrated structural system for highly efficient water evaporation. The GP/SCM composite can efficiently convert the absorbed solar energy to heat energy, e.g., the 8 mg-GP/SCM (i.e., the GP/SCM with 8 mg GP added) enables water evaporation with high efficiency of 56.8% under 1.5 kW/m2 irradiation and 65.8% under 3 kW/m2 irradiation, respectively. Cycling tests verify that the GP/SCM could retain stable water evaporation performance over 20 cycles under the same conditions. Contrast experiments show that the other carbon-containing solar-absorbers, such as acetylene black (AB) and graphene nanoplates (GNPs) in SCM, display relatively low evaporation efficiency of 41.4% and 36.7%, respectively, under the simulated solar irradiation with a light density of 1.5 kW/m2. The laminar GP/SCM composite obtained in our work is low-cost, easy-to-prepare, recyclable, and highly efficient in its photothermal performance, so that it distinctly contributes to water evaporation.

Abstract: Polyethylene glycol form-stable phase change materials (PEG FSPCMs) have received much attention in recent years for thermal energy storage applications due to their remarkable thermal properties. However, the conventional synthesis of PEG FSPCMs usually employed chemical grade regents as starting materials, which is unlikely suitable for large-scale industrial preparation of PCMs. In the present work, silicagel industrial wastes were employed as starting materials for the first time to synthesize a polyethylene glycol/silica-hydroxyl compound (PEG/SHC) form-stable phase change material using a facile sol-gel method. The morphology and chemical compatibility were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The thermal energy storage performance was evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermal constants analysis, respectively. The results indicated that the PEG was encapsulated in the SHC matrix through a physical interaction, and the weight fraction of PEG in the FSPCM could be as high as 80% with no significant leaking liquid observed. The thermal energy storage capacity in this FSPCM was found to be (59.38–132.4) J/g and (63.56–133.4) J/g in the melting and crystallization process, respectively, as the loaded PEG weight fraction ranging from 50% to 80%. The thermal conductivity of the FSPCM enhanced by the SHC matrix was determined to be as high as 30% compared with that of the pure PEG. Additionally, the FSPCM synthesized in this method could maintain a stable thermal property during the heating/cooling cycles. On the basis of these results, it was demonstrated that the sol-gel method developed in this work could not only obtain PEG based FSPCMs with good performance for thermal energy storage, but also propose an effective way of producing economic benefits by reusing silicagel industrial wastes.

Abstract: In early 2017, the world record efficiency for single-junction crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells was achieved by merging amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/c-Si heterojunction technology and back-contact architecture. However, to fabricate such silicon heterojunction interdigitated back-contact (SHJ-IBC) solar cells, complex a-Si:H patterning steps are required to form the interdigitated a-Si:H strips at the back side of the devices. This fabrication complexity raises concerns about the commercial potential of such devices. In this work, a novel process scheme for a-Si:H patterning using damage-free laser ablation is presented, leading to a fast, simple and photolithography-free emitter patterning approach for SHJ-IBC solar cells. To prevent laser-induced damage to the a-Si:H/c-Si heterocontact, an a-Si:H laser-absorbing layer and a dielectric mask are deposited on top of the a-Si:H/c-Si. Laser ablation only removes the top a-Si:H layer, reducing laser damage to the bottom a-Si:H/c-Si heterocontact under the dielectric mask. This dielectric mask is a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), resulting in a high reflectance of 80% at the laser wavelength and thus providing additional protection to the a-Si:H/c-Si heterocontact. Using such simple a-Si:H patterning method, a proof-of concept 4-cm2 SHJ-IBC solar cell with an efficiency of up to 22.5% is achieved.

Abstract: Incorporation of CdSe layers into CdTe thin film solar cells has recently emerged as a route to improve cell performance. It has been suggested that the formation of lower band gap CdTe(1-x)Se(x) phases following Se diffusion induces bandgap grading which may increase the carrier lifetime and thereby open circuit voltage. In this study we investigate the impact of CdSe incorporation on CdTe solar cell performance. We demonstrate that the standard CdS/CdTe device architecture is incompatible with Se incorporation, owing to large optical losses. An alternative cell structure with an oxide partner layer replacing the CdS with SnO2/CdSe/CdTe is developed, leading to cell efficiencies of > 13.5%. The differences in processing required for effective selenium incorporation are investigated with performance improvements resulting from additional post-growth annealing. Finally, other oxides such as TiO2, ZnO and FTO are demonstrated to be unsuitable partner layers but highlight that the choice of partner layer is key to further improving the performance.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to identify a normalizer or combination of normalizers for quantitative evaluation of the expression of a target gene of interest during melanoma progression. Adult melanocytes, uveal primary melanoma cells and cutaneous primary and metastatic melanoma cells were used to construct a panel of 14 experimental models reflecting cancer promotion and progression. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), glucuronidase beta (GUSB), ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein progression. Adult melanocytes, uveal primary melanoma cells and cutaneous primary and metastatic melanoma cells were used to construct a panel of 14 experimental models reflecting cancer promotion and progression. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), glucuronidase beta (GUSB), ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A (SRNPA) were chosen as candidate housekeeping genes. NormFinder software was used to identify the best reference gene or pair of reference genes from five candidate housekeeping genes, on the basis of expression stability in a given experimental model. The suitability of references was validated by normalizing the transcriptional activities of E-cadherin (CDH1), N-cadherin (CDH2) and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) target genes. It has been shown that the relative expression of CDH2 and ERAP1 target genes in a given cell line may vary between experimental models, leading to biological misinterpretation. In view of this, we devised a strategy for improved selection of the best stable reference and for obtaining biologically consistent results. This strategy avoided experimental model- and normalizer-dependent conclusions concerning the relative expression of target gene, in the examined cell lines.

Abstract: Uric acid nephropathy (UAN) is one of the most common metabolic diseases and leads to kidney damage. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Weicao capsule on renal injury of UAN rats and to examine whether the mechanism was associated with induction of autophagy and degradation of nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptor (NLR) protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into 6 groups: Control, Model, Allopurinol, and Weicao (0.55/1.1/2.2 g/kg) group. The data showed activation of renal NLRP3 inflammasome in UAN rats, with elevation in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, and subsequent deterioration of renal injury. Fortunately, Weicao had a markedly therapeutic effect on UAN rats, including improving renal function-related indexes, ameliorating hyperuricemia-related inflammation, decreasing crystals in renal tissue and alleviating renal interstitial fibrosis. Additionally, Weicao exerted anti-proliferative and anti-apoptosis effects on rat renal tubular epithelial cell NRK-52E in macrophages from UAN rats. Our investigation into the mechanism revealed that Weicao suppressed the activated NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, Weicao induced autophagy, as evidenced by a dose-dependent increase in levels of renal autophagy-related proteins in UAN rats. Moreover, autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and NLRP3 activator ATP blocked the effect of Weicao on autophagy induction and NLRP3 inflammasome degradation. In conclusion, Weicao had similar effects as allopurinol and exerted anti-inflammatory and renal-protective effect in a concentration-dependent manner in UAN rats, most likely through increasing autophagy and NLRP3 degradation. Our study provides new insight into the underlying mechanism of Weicao in the treatment of UAN.

Abstract: PbS nanocrystals are an important narrow-gap material for solar cells and photodetectors. Nevertheless, their application may be limited because device performance can be affected by atmospheric conditions. Indeed, the presence of oxygen and/or water can degrade the active layers, possibly leading to device failure. Strategies to address this issue are therefore actively explored. Here we report a solution-processed PbS quantum dot solar cell, consisting of a PbS-silane functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PbS-rGO) layer on top of the PbS absorber film, which enhances device stability, especially when the solar cells are exposed to moisture. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) measurements demonstrate a slower degradation under continuous illumination for solar cells with PbS-rGO. When storing the samples under saturated water vapor, differences are even more remarkable: with PbS-rGO the solar cells essentially maintain their initial PCE, while the PCE of the PbS reference devices is reduced by 50% after 5 days. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the damage to the PbS films and the formation of PbSOx crystals in the PbS reference devices. Such crystals are not observed in the PbS-rGO devices, further supporting the importance of the PbS-rGO barrier layer.

Abstract: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor that responds to oxidative stress and xenobiotics. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Nrf2 activation protects against aging, inflammation, and many diseases, including cancer. Nrf2 activators derived from natural sources have been widely studied. In this study, we investigated the effect of amentoflavone (AFN), a biflavonoid found in many plants, on Nrf2 signaling in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). AFN significantly increased ARE luciferase activity by Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus. Subsequently, the levels of a Nrf2 target protein, NQO-1, were significantly increased by AFN in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To verify the mechanism of AFN-induced activation of Nrf2 signaling, we measured generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly AFN triggered mild ROS production. Additionally, AFN-induced Nrf2 activation was inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine. Therefore, we studied the effect of ROS-related signaling on Nrf2 by measuring the activation of AKT and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38. The results showed that the pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K/AKT (LY294002) or p38 (SB 203580), but not ERK1/2 (U0126), abrogated AFN-induced Nrf2 activation. Subsequently, we found that silencing or inhibition of p38 resulted in decrease of AKT phosphorylation as well as inhibition of Nrf2 accumulation. Furthermore, we found that AFN stabilized Nrf2 by inhibiting its ubiquitination. Taken together, our results suggest that AFN contributes to Nrf2 activation through ROS-mediated activation of the p38-AKT pathway in HaCaT cells.

Abstract: Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) has during the last decade emerged as an excellent surface passivation material for both planar and micro/nanostructured silicon. The post-ALD thermal treatment required to activate the surface passivation of Al2O3 results often in blistering and film delamination. Here, we studied how several fabrication steps affect blistering and the quality of surface passivation by Al2O3. Decreasing the fraction of blistered area on planar Si surfaces results in lower surface recombination velocity, in agreement with previous reports. By using simple analytical expressions, we estimated that surface recombination is at least 20 times faster at the blisters than at the non-blistered areas. Exposing the Si surface to a reactive ion etch (RIE) treatment as short as 30 s is enough to suppress blistering. Anti-reflective nanostructured Si (black Si) fabricated using the same RIE process by increasing the RIE time does not suffer from blistering either. Finally, we investigated the effective lifetime of black Si textured surfaces and we implemented a pre-ALD conditioning routine that dramatically improves the quality of passivation by Al2O3 on black Si.

Abstract: Upcoming generation of smart windows requires simple design, fast stimulus response and cost-effective production. Aiming these features, we reported a new approach of switchable devices based on the thermosensitive polymer poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) and facile assembly of the components (FTO layers and polymer). Its optical/color change from transparent to opaque is temperature-dependent and activated by induced Joule heating of conductive substrates. Therefore, the reported devices showed fast reversible response (less than 60 s) by small input power and adjustable opaqueness according to polymer concentration. In opposite to traditional electrochromic smart windows dependence of the kinetics charge-transfer reaction, the observed features are triggered by the thermodynamic mechanism of the reversible coil-globule transition from PNVCL suspension, which can lead to stable performance of the proposed device.

Mitochondria-related oxidative stress contributes to ovarian cancer-promoting activity of mesothelial cells subjected to malignant ascites,

Abstract: Very little is known about the mechanisms by which malignant ascites modulates the cancer-promoting activity of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). Because malignant ascites induces pro-tumoral senescence in HPMCs, here we examined if this effect could be driven by oxidative stress. The study showed that malignant ascites generated by serous ovarian tumors induced oxidative damage to the DNA (γH2A.X, 53BP1, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine) and lipids (8-isoprostane) in HPMCs as well as increased the production of mitochondrial superoxides and cellular peroxides in these cells. This activity coincided with increased activity of two enzymes involved in the mitochondrial production of oxidants, i.e. cytochrome c oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase, decreased mitochondrial inner membrane potential, increased mitochondrial mass, and increased the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha. Increased production of superoxides and peroxides in cells subjected to the malignant ascites was effectively reduced when the fluid was pre-incubated with neutralizing antibodies against hepatocyte growth factor. Moreover, when HPMCs subjected to the malignant ascites were protected against oxidative stress with a spin-trap scavenger of reactive oxygen species, they displayed decreased expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and their potential to stimulate cancer cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration was significantly diminished. Collectively, our findings indicate that improved ovarian cancer cell progression in response to HPMCs exposed to malignant ascites may be associated with the development of profound oxidative stress in these cells.

Abstract: Recent investigations of the front side metallization of high-efficiency mono-crystalline Si solar cells proved that the glass layer formed at the Si/metallization interface during the screen printing plays an essential role for the charge transport, both in n- and p-type cells. High-efficiency cells (~ 18.0% for p-type and ~ 20% for n-type cells) show similar microstructure of the glass layer and similar temperature dependence of the series resistance. From this it is concluded that the microstructure of the glass layer determines the series and contact resistance of the front side metallization. The glass layers of high-efficiency cells contain a high density of nano-Ag colloids and other precipitates which reduce the contact resistance. A percolation model was proposed and is best suited to describe the charge transport in a dirty semiconductor containing metallic precipitates. Quantitative chemical composition of the glass layer of p- and n-type cells was investigated by Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis in SEM and TEM. The chemical composition of the glass layer showed (SiOx)Pb, as main constitutes and Zn, Ti, Al, Ag, P and B as minor constituents with mole fractions above the detection limit of EDX. The glass layer is therefore considered to be a dirty semiconductor rather than a perfect insulator. The mole fractions of Zn (~ 1at%) and Al (~ 1at%) were quantitatively analyzed. Such analyses are important to correlate microstructural features with electrical properties of the front side metallization. We could prove that in p-type cells the efficiency of the cells correlated with the chemical composition of the glass layer. In n-type cells, with Al-containing pastes EDX spectroscopy yielded Al beyond the detection limit in the glass layer, whereas for Al free pastes the Al mole fraction was below the detection limit of EDX and yielded reduced efficiencies. In p-type cells pastes with enhanced Zn mole fraction yielding zinc oxide phases in the bulk Ag finger and Zn mole fractions up to 5at% in the glass layer.

Abstract: Luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) integrated with c-Si photovoltaic cells (PV cells) in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) could grow up to be an important element of our life for energy harvest in the future. Heavy metal free quantum dots (QDs) are promising for LSC applications, which can be controlled to possess effective large Stokes Shift and low reabsorption of emission that benefit their applications in BIPV. In our work, different amount and size of SiO2 particles were added to CuInS2/ZnS QDs based LSCs to realize highly efficient scattering enhanced LSC (S-LSC) devices. Since SiO2 particles induced scattering effect, we achieved a power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 4.20%, which showed an improvement of 60.3% compared with the pure QDs based LSC without SiO2 particles. This study suggests a new method of scattering enhancement to realize better performance for LSC.

Abstract: A novel hybrid material, AG-PYPMI, with push-pull 9-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)perylene-3,4-dicarboximide (PYPMI) attached to amine functionalized graphene (AG) is reported. The wide spectral window of attached push-pull perylene dye enhances the light harvesting ability of AG-PYPMI. The catalytic composite of the AG-PYPMI with platinum (AG-PYPMI/Pt) is proved to be a proficient material for the generation of hydrogen from water by utilizing solar energy. The synergistic effect of PYPMI in the synthesized composite material, AG-PYPMI, has enhanced 4.3 fold of its hydrogen generation (1009 µmol g−1) efficiency with three hours of visible light irradiation. The thermal and photochemical stability of AG-PYPMI make it as a promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion.

Abstract: This paper provides a detailed study of the thermoelectric properties of SiC/AlN composites in a wide temperature range. Evaluation of thermal stress durability of the composites was simulated and analyzed. SiC/AlN composites with 0–30 wt% of AlN were produced by the pressureless sintering method. Phase analysis, densification, and microstructure of the obtained composites were inspected. SiC/AlN ceramics had a porous structure with porosity ranging from 23.77% to 31.74%. Complete 2Hss SiC/AlN solid solution was formed and its content increased with the increment of AlN wt%. Addition of AlN to SiC ceramics gave a harmonic structure with elongated grains morphology. Electrical resistivity and thermoelectric properties of the investigated ceramics were evaluated in the temperature range of 25–1000 K. The results were essentially dependent on AlN content, microstructure and temperature. SiC/AlN composites gave identical behavior of the p-type semiconductors with outstanding thermoelectric properties at high temperatures. The lowest electrical resistivity of 1.5 × 105 µOhm × cm and the highest Seebeck coefficient of 370 µ V/K were recorded for 30% AlN composite at 1000 K. Figure of merit (ZT) increased dramatically with increasing the AlN content. 30% AlN composites recorded ZT value 130 times larger than that of the 0% AlN composite. Thermoelectric power factor was markedly enhanced by increasing AlN wt%. Thermal stress analysis of the different ceramics was simulated by finite element method up to a temperature of 1773 K. SiC/AlN composites gave splendid thermal stress durability with uniform transition and distribution of heat. SiC/AlN composites are strongly nominated to be used effectively in thermoelectric power generation and high-temperature applications.

Abstract: Hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) films have demonstrated a unique combination of low parasitic absorption and high conductivity. Here, we report on the use of n-type nc-SiOx:H as front surface field (FSF) in rear-emitter silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells exhibiting excellent electrical cell parameters at a thickness down to only 5 nm. Using a seed layer, we are able to maintain excellent electrical performance (high fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (VOC)), while enhancing layer transparency for maximizing short circuit current (JSC). These results, together with the short deposition time (< 100 s), make the (n)nc-SiOx:H FSF attractive for reducing production costs in industrial applications. The best device, with the optimized (n)nc-SiOx:H FSF layer, shows VOC of 731 mV, FF of 80.6%, JSC of 38.3 mA/cm2 and a power conversion efficiency of 22.6%.

Abstract: As an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related protein, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is involved in inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, the mechanisms of the transcriptional regulation of MANF is still undefined. Here, we showed that MANF expression was upregulated in hepatitis B tissues and hepatoma cells, and positively correlated with the spliced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1s). Both overexpression of XBP1s and tunicamycin treatment were able to enhance MANF transcription. On the contrary, inhibition of XBP1 splicing by IRE1α endonuclease inhibitor or knockdown of XBP1s with siRNA attenuated MANF expression. Two ER stress-responsive elements (ERSE) were found in the promoter region of MANF (ERSE I and ERSE II). The chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assay showed that XBP1s mainly binds to ERSE I to promote MANF transcription. Moreover, MANF was found to interact with XBP1s to enhance its own expression. Our findings uncover a new mechanism of ERSE-dependent transcriptional regulation of MANF, as well as a key role of XBP1s in promoting the MANF expression.

Abstract: Purpose
Several studies showed conflicting results about prognosis and predictors of outcome of critically ill patients with hematological malignancies (HM). The aim of this study is to determine the hospital outcome of critically ill patients with HM and the factors predicting the outcome.
Methods and materials
All patients with HM admitted to MICU at a tertiary academic medical center were enrolled. Clinical data upon admission and during ICU stay were collected. Hospital, ICU, and 6 months outcomes were documented.
Results
There were 130 HM patients during the study period. Acute Leukemia was the most common malignancy (31.5%) followed by Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (28.5%). About 12.5% patients had autologous HSCT and 51.5% had allogeneic HSCT. Sepsis was the most common ICU diagnosis (25.9%). ICU mortality and hospital mortality were 24.8% and 45.3%, respectively. Six months mortality (available on 80% of patients) was 56.7%. Hospital mortality was higher among mechanically ventilated patients (75%). Using multivariate analysis, only mechanical ventilation (OR of 19.0, CI: 3.1–117.4, P: 0.001) and allogeneic HSCT (OR of 10.9, CI: 1.8–66.9, P: 0.01) predicted hospital mortality.
Conclusion
Overall hospital outcome of critically ill patients with HM is improving. However those who require mechanical ventilation or underwent allogeneic HSCT continue to have poor outcome.

Abstract: Silicon solar cells incorporating double-sided pyramidal texture are capable of superior light trapping over cells with front-side only texture. However, increased surface area, roughness and exposed <111> crystal planes of textured surfaces not only causes increased recombination, but also makes cells susceptible to shunting through pinholes in the dielectric at the sharp peaks and valleys of the textured pyramids. A polyimide film as an insulating interlayer film is investigated to circumvent the tradeoff between improved light trapping, increased recombination and increased shunt paths. When applied at the rear of the interdigitated back contact silicon solar cell structure, the polyimide film provides an excellent electrical insulation (> 1000 MΩ of insulation resistance) and increases photocurrent (~ 1.1 mA/cm2) owing to an increased rear internal reflectance. The polyimide is also compatible with metal annealing of passivating dielectrics such as silicon nitride. Optical simulation and experimental results are combined in a 3D semiconductor simulation (Quokka) to quantify the possible gain of implementing the double-sided texture in high efficiency silicon solar cells.

Abstract: The development of new therapeutic strategies to control or reverse hepatic fibrosis requires thorough knowledge about its molecular and cellular basis. It is known that the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1–7) [ang-(1–7)] can reduce hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in vivo; therefore, it is important to uncover the mechanisms regulating its activity and cellular model of investigation. Ang-(1–7) is a peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and here we investigated its modulatory effect on the expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) LX-2, which transdifferentiate into fibrogenic and proliferative cells. We compared the miRNA profiles between quiesced, activated and ang-(1–7)-treated activated HSCs to identify miRNAs that may regulate their transdifferentiation. Thirteen miRNAs were pointed, and cellular and molecular analyses identified miRNA-1914-5p as a molecule that contributes to the effects of ang-(1–7) on lipid metabolism and on the pro-fibrotic environment control. In our cellular model, we also analyzed the regulators of fatty acid metabolism. Specifically, miRNA-1914-5p regulates the expression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MLYCD) and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP or Lipin-1). Additionally, Lipin-1 was closely correlated with mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α and −γ, which also contribute to lipid homeostasis and to the reduction of TGF-β1 expression. These findings provide a novel link between RAS and lipid metabolism in controlling HSCs activation.

Abstract: Molten nitrate salts are currently the most common mature solution for thermal energy storage at the concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Enhancing heat capacity and thermal conductivity of molten salts via doping by inorganic nanoparticles has attracted an explosively increasing interest due to the possibility of a considerable decrease of the investment costs for CSP technology. However, to the best of our knowledge there is almost no information on the effect of such doping on the corrosivity of the molten salts. In this work we demonstrate that adding small amounts of nanoparticles into the molten nitrate HitecXL salt considerably increases its corrosivity and modifies the corrosion mechanisms. A set of advanced techniques such as SEM-EDX, XPS and XRD are applied to get insights into the effect of inorganic nano-additives on the corrosion phenomenon.

Abstract: We report the first demonstration of MOVPE-grown inverted metamorphic (IMM) cells with QDs embedded in the middle GaAs sub-cell. The IMM cells were fabricated on full 4″ wafer using Epitaxial Lift off (ELO) technology. GaAs sub-cell embedded with 10 and 20 periods of InAs/GaP strain compensated QDs showed increase in current with number of QD periods. The single junction GaAs sub cell embedded with 20 periods of InAs/GaP strain compensated QDs showed 3.2% relative increase in JSC in comparison with control sample without QDs. Integrated short circuit (JSC) from measurements of external quantum efficiency (EQE) of currents showed a 65% increase in sub-band collection in the GaAs sub-cell when the number of QD layers increased from 10 to 20. IMM cells with QD's embedded in the middle cell showed minimal loss in open circuit voltage (VOC) in comparison to control sample without QDs. An efficiency of 30% under 1-sun AM0 spectrum was obtained for IMM cells with 10 xs of InAs/GaP QDs in GaAs sub-cell. Quantum efficiency remaining factor of > 95% in the QD absorption region (940 nm) was measured for IMM devices with InAs/GaAs QD enhanced GaAs sub-cells irradiated with 1 MeV electrons under 2E15 /cm2 fluence.

Abstract: Proteases are localized throughout mitochondria and function as critical regulators of all aspects of mitochondrial biology. As such, the activities of these proteases are sensitively regulated through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms to adapt mitochondrial function to specific cellular demands. Here, we discuss the stress-responsive mechanisms responsible for regulating mitochondrial protease activity and the implications of this regulation on mitochondrial function. Furthermore, we describe how imbalances in the activity or regulation of mitochondrial proteases induced by genetic, environmental, or aging-related factors influence mitochondria in the context of disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which cells regulate mitochondrial function through alterations in protease activity provide insights into the contributions of these proteases in pathologic mitochondrial dysfunction and reveals new therapeutic opportunities to ameliorate this dysfunction in the context of diverse classes of human disease.

Abstract: A supercapacitor is well recognized as one of emerging energy sources for powering electronic devices in our daily life. Although various kind of supercapacitors have been designed and demonstrated, their market aspect could become advanced if the utilisation of other physicochemical properties (e.g. optical) is incorporated in the electrode. Herein, we present an electrochromic supercapacitor (smart supercapacitor) based on a nanoflake NiMoO4 thin film which is fabricated using a facile and well-controlled successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. The polycrystalline nanoflake NiMoO4 electrode exhibits a large electrochemically active surface area of ~ 96.3 cm2. Its nanoporous architecture provides an easy pathway for the intercalation and de-intercalation of ions. The nanoflake NiMoO4 electrode is dark-brown in the charged state and becomes transparent in the discharged state with a high optical modulation of 57%. The electrode shows a high specific capacity of 1853 Fg–1 at a current rate of 1 Ag–1 with a good coloration efficiency of 31.44 cm2/C. Dynamic visual information is obtained when the electrode is charged at different potentials, reflecting the level of energy storage in the device. The device retains 65% capacity after 2500 charge-discharge cycles compared with its initial capacity. The excellent performance of the nanoflake NiMoO4 based smart supercapacitor is associated with the synergetic effect of nanoporous morphology with a large electrochemically active surface area and desired chemical composition for redox reaction.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) have been widely used as efficient materials in latent heat thermal storage systems for various applications. The poor thermal conductivity of most organic phase change materials (OPCMs), however, has long been considered as one of big obstacles hindering their practical applications. Here, we report the first examples of Manganese dioxide nanowires and nanotubes based PCM nanocomposites (named as MnO2 NWs/PCM and MnO2 NTs/PCM) with enhanced thermal conductivity by simply using MnO2 nanowires and nanotubes as efficient nanofillers. The PCMs nanocomposites show high latent heat ranging from 140.1 J g−1 to 206.1 J g−1. The thermal conductivity of PCM nanocomposites were dramatically enhanced by incorporation of Manganese dioxide nanowires and nanotubes with a maximum value of 377.16% of that of pure PA achieved, which is nearly two times of that of control. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the incorporation of nanofillers does not change the crystalline structure of OPCMs while lowering its crystalline size. The PCM nanocomposites also show excellent thermal stability of recyclability. Only a slight loss of 2.8% in latent heat was observed after 100 times of melting/cooling cycles. Based on their high heat storage performance, excellent thermal conductivity and thermal stability of recyclability, the as-prepared PCM nanocomposites may have great potentials for energy saving applications.

Abstract: In the present study, we synthesized TiO2 nanofibers (NFs) by electrospinning technique and they were subject to solvosonication process using glycerol as a pore forming agent to produce porous TiO2 NFs. The prepared porous TiO2 NFs are seen to improve the light harvesting capability as a result of enhanced light scattering inside the TiO2 NFs and offer a high surface area for maximum adsorption of pre-synthesized CdSe (~4 nm) QDs. The FE-SEM and BET analysis were performed to confirm the surface texture and surface area of porous TiO2 NFs, respectively. Finally, QDSSCs were fabricated using these porous TiO2 NFs sensitized with CdSe QDs as the photoanode, Cu2S nanoparticles as the counter electrode and polysulfide redox couple (S2−/Sx2−) as the electrolyte. The porous TiO2 NFs obtained by solvosonication at the time duration of 90 min has enhanced photocurrent density (Jsc) of 9.21 mA/cm2 with high power conversion efficiency (η) of 2.15% than the conventional TiO2 NFs (η ≈ 1.50%).

Abstract: We report the improvement in photostability of P3HT:PC60BM based bulk heterojunction solar cells deposited on Al-doped ZnO as a cathode layer replacing ITO as regularly used TCO in cells with N-I-P configuration. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate that use of thicker ZnO:Al as cathode can successfully cut down the rate of photodegradation in short circuit current by ~40% and open circuit voltage by ~30% compared to the control device made on ITO based cathode. This effective reduction in photodegradation is understood to be coming from the absorption of ultraviolet and blue photon in the cathode layer itself. The loss in short circuit current due to the loss of blue photon in EQE is compensated by higher FF (lower series resistance) due to thicker ZnO:Al layer resulting in final device efficiency almost uncompromised with added benefit of reduced photo degradation. The experimental results are supported with optical simulations which show more absorption in the short wavelength region for the thicker ZnO films, compared to ITO films, deposited on glass substrates. This work also proposes using ZnO:Al cathode as a template for random textured front surface to potentially increase short circuit current by increase in photon absorption in active layer matrix by light scattering techniques. Our results provide an inexpensive pathway for improving the stability of organic photovoltaics without compromising the device performance.

Abstract: Nucleation and growth process of electrodeposited polymer determine its morphology, thus its function and applicability. In this work, we show how minute changes in polymerization condition, like current density and electrolyte concentration, alter nucleation pattern of polythiophene. Different nucleation patterns in turn give rise to different morphology and functional properties. Polythiophene was electrochemically synthesized on indium tin oxide (ITO) using boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF3.Et2O) electrolyte. At constant current density (8 μA/cm2), 20 vol% electrolyte gives rise to dendritic structures, while pure electrolyte gives rise to uniform film. Similarly, if current density was increased (0.08–0.4 mA/cm2) in 20 vol% electrolyte, dendritic structures were completely suppressed and again uniform polymer film was obtained. Although electrical properties are compromised in the dendritic sample owing to the higher surface roughness, dendritic structures efficiently guide light and are shown to be a good candidate for photonic and energy applications. On the other hand; uniform polythiophene, obtained at high current density and electrolyte concentration shows enhanced redox capacity and electrical conductivity. Utilizing optical and electrical properties of smooth polythiophene films (without dendrites), basic photovoltaic (PV) device (Glass/ITO/PT/P3HT:PC61BM/Al) was constructed using electrochemically grown polythiophene as Hole-Transporting Layer (HTL). Fabricated device exhibits significant photovoltaic performance with comparable efficiencies of 0.98–1.24%. Such electrochemically grown polythiophene thin films can be a substitute for other HTLs (like PEDOT: PSS) in photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: The demand for low-cost high efficient photoelectronic devices tends to drive the present need for investigations on advanced multi-functional semiconducting nanostructures. In this regard, the physico-chemical traits of sonochemically processed ZnTe nanostructures and hydrothermally grown ZnO nanostructures were studied using Raman, UV–vis absorbance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high resolution microscopic tools. The p-n ZnTe/ZnO heterojunctions were then fabricated via spin casting a colloidal ZnTe suspension on periodically aligned ZnO nanowires and investigated for their photoelectronic functionalities. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics revealed an obvious rectifying behaviour with the forward current and rectification ratio getting improved on lowering the threshold voltages. The series resistance of the diodes were additionally studied using the dV/dlnI derivate plots. The stability of the diodes were also affirmed using their time-dependent photoresponse characteristics, which actually suggested the improved and effective separation of photo generated electron hole pairs across the interface. Finally, the ZnTe/ZnO heterojunction behaviour was assimilated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) results that were studied individually for ZnTe and ZnO nanostructures and collectively across ZnTe/ZnO heterostructure.

Abstract: Nanoparticle based direct solar absorption is a promising technology for future solar thermal systems. Having so many individual studies on different nanomaterials for solar energy harness, a comprehensive comparison of photothermal conversion characteristics of various nanofluids at the same experimental conditions is much needed. The photothermal conversion performance of six commonly used nanomaterials in direct absorption solar collectors (DASC) was investigated under a focused simulated solar flux. The contribution of sensible heating and latent heat of vaporization of the nanofluids was revealed in context of their photothermal performance. The results show that all the nanofluids have higher solar energy absorption than the base fluid and silver nanofluid turned out to be the best amongst all due its strong plasmonic resonance nature. A 99.7% enhancement in the photothermal conversion efficiency of silver was achieved within the experimental domain. A simulation model was proposed to state the temperature difference between the surface of the nanoparticle and the surrounding fluid under lower solar flux.

Abstract: Phase change Materials (PCMs) have a promising future in the energy fields of latent heat storage, solar energy conversion and building thermal management. In this work, two types of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with different diameters were prepared and combined with paraffin, octadecanol and stearic acid PCMs, respectively. The one-pot hydrothermal method was employed for the synthesis of three-dimensional graphene network encapsulating organic PCMs. There is some research investigate that rGO addition has different degrees of impact on the latent heat and thermal conductivity of different kinds of organic PCMs. The rGO/PCM composite has a significantly enhanced thermal conductivity of 3.21 W m−1 K−1 with an rGO loading of 10 wt%. Furthermore, a fraction of graphene was substituted by Ag nanoparticles. The thermal conductivity of rGO/PCM/Ag could be as high as 5.89 W m−1 K−1. The size effect of rGO has a significant influence on the thermal contact resistance. The synergistic effect of rGO network and Ag nanoparticles also benefits the thermal conductivity of nano-enhanced phase change materials (NePCMs).

Abstract: The electrical parameters and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3 MeV and 8 MeV proton beam irradiated upright metamorphic (UMM) GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells, grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, have been investigated and compared to lattice-matched (LM) GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cells. High-resolution X-ray diffraction was used to study the relaxation of strain by analysing reciprocal space maps. Threading dislocation density was estimated from cathodoluminescence image. SRIM simulation results have been applied for analysing the irradiation induced displacement damage and its effects on cell performance. The results show that the electrical parameters of both UMM and LM cells degraded more by 3 MeV proton compared to 8 MeV proton irradiation. The degradation of Voc and Isc depends on each other in both UMM and LM cells but have different features under proton irradiation due to different cell configurations, materials, and parameters etc. EQE spectra of UMM and LM cells mainly degrades in longer wavelength region due to the reduction of minority carrier diffusion length. Top GaInP subcell in UMM cell shows better radiation resistance than LM cell due to the higher In-P composition, and middle GaInAs middle subcell in UMM structure shows weaker radiation resistance because of the relatively higher indium composition.

Abstract: Accumulation of senescent endothelial cells can contribute to endothelium dysfunction. Suppression of MTOR signaling has been shown to delay senescence but the mechanism that underpins this effect, particularly one that involves miRNAs, remains to be further defined. This study sought to identify miRNAs involved in MTORC1-mediated inhibition of replicative senescence in endothelial cells. Pre-senescent HUVECs were prolonged treated with low dose rapamycin (1 nM), an MTOR inhibitor. Rapamycin treatment down-regulated the phosphorylated MTOR, RPS6 and 4EBP1 expressions, which confirmed MTORC1 suppression. Prolonged low dose rapamycin treatment has significantly reduced the percentage of senescence-associated beta galactosidase (SA-β gal) positively stained senescent cells and P16INK4A expression in these cells. On the contrary, the percentage of BrdU-labelled proliferating cells has significantly increased. RPTOR, a positive regulator of MTORC1 was knockdown using RPTOR siRNA to inhibit MTORC1 activation. RPTOR knockdown was evidenced by significant suppressions of RPTOR mRNA and protein expression levels. In these cells, the expression of miR-107 was down-regulated whereas miR-145-5p and miR-217 were up-regulated. Target gene prediction revealed PTEN as the target of miR-107 and this was confirmed by biotin pull-down assay. Over-expression of miR-107 has decreased PTEN expression, increased MTORC1 activity, induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and up-regulated P16INK4A expression but mitigated tube formation. Collectively, our findings revealed that delayed endothelial replicative senescence caused by the inhibition of MTORC1 activation could be modulated by miR-107 via its influence on PTEN.

Abstract: Wafers and thicker slices of an entire n-type monocrystalline silicon ingot were studied using production-compatible electrical and optical characterization techniques. We investigated the capability of these techniques to detect efficiency limiting factors in the early phase of solar cell manufacturing. In addition to the standard characterization methods and parameters - carrier lifetime, resistivity, FTIR, photoluminescence (PL) - the OxyMap technique was used to evaluate the thermal history of the wafers, while the distribution of Bulk Micro Defects (BMD) was measured using Light Scattering Tomography (LST). PERT cells and samples with amorphous silicon surface passivation – deposited at low temperature – were produced from neighboring wafers to correlate silicon properties and solar cell efficiency results. An interesting indirect correlation was found between “as-grown” lifetime and cell performance, as both are influenced by the thermal history of the wafer. We also observed a very strong correlation between BMD position, measured by LST on as-grown samples, and defective areas on PERT cells localized by PL measurements. The LST measurements on heat treated samples (simulating the PERT cell process) showed the growth of BMDs in low efficiency areas. It indicates that the detection of harmful defects is possible even in the as-grown material using LST technique.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells are a promising solar energy technology that could greatly increase the number of ways that solar cells can be utilised. Many of these applications involve the use of thin silver electrodes, however little attention has been paid to the role that electrode thickness plays in the operational stability of the device. This study found that inverted OPV devices with thin silver electrodes exhibited a catastrophic failure with only modest amounts of thermal ageing – primarily driven by substantial increases in the series resistance and decreases in the fill factor of the devices. Subsequent analysis by atomic force microscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry showed that as the devices aged, gaps in thin silver electrodes appeared, showing that the electrode was de-wetting from the device, which would explain the rise in series resistance. This represents an intrinsic vulnerability in inverted OPV devices that can avoided if the silver electrode is sufficiently thick (> 60nm). This problem can be overcome with the addition of a thin metal-oxide layer on top of the electrode which greatly slowed the electrode de-wetting with little variation in device performance – representing a potential solution for applications where a thin silver electrode is required.

Abstract: Immunotherapy represents a breakthrough in cancer treatment in the past decade. It is a powerful treatment modality that can help transform cancer into a manageable disease by enabling the immune system to eliminate tumor cells. Advances in the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy, and oncolytic viruses have led to exceptional and durable clinical responses in patients with late-stage disease. Here we discuss some approved or under investigation immunotherapeutics that either directly involve T-cells such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cells and checkpoint inhibitors or lead to the activation of T-cells such as oncolytic viruses.

Abstract: Bamboo salt is generated by baking bamboo and sea salt and is used as a traditional food or medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-ageing skin effects of Korean bamboo salt and to compare the antioxidant, anti-ageing and anti-inflammatory effects of various salts, including purified salt, solar salt, bath solar salt, Masada solar salt, 1-time baked bamboo salt (1× bamboo salt), and 9-times baked bamboo salt (9× bamboo salt). Based on the content of mineral elements, pH, OH groups and redox potential amperometric analysis, the 9× bamboo salt showed the most antioxidant components and characteristics compared to the other salts. The in vitro results showed that the 9× bamboo salt could inhibit oxidative damage by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment in HaCaT keratinocytes, and its effect was better than that of the other salts. In an in vivo experiment, SHK-1 hairless mice were treated with UV (ultraviolet) radiation to induce ageing. The epidermal thickness and epidermal structures were then assessed by phenotypic and histological analyses. The 0.2% 9× bamboo salt- and 1× bamboo salt-treated mice had a thinner epidermis than the control mice, and the sebaceous glands were almost intact with a regular arrangement that was similar to those in the normal group. Compared with the UV-treated group (control group) and other salt-treated groups, the 9× bamboo salt- and 1× bamboo salt-treated groups had higher dermal collagen and elastic fibre content. Fewer mast cells were observed in the 9× bamboo salt- and 1× bamboo salt-treated groups than in the control group. The activities of the skin antioxidant-related enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the 9× bamboo salt- and 1× bamboo salt-treated groups were higher than those in other groups and similar to those in the normal group, but lipid peroxide (LPO) activity and carbonylated protein levels showed the opposite trends. Furthermore, the 9× bamboo salt- and 1× bamboo salt-treated groups had protein contents similar to those of the normal group. In addition, the 9× bamboo salt and 1× bamboo salt effectively down-regulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and up-regulated the expression of tissue inhibitor expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), SOD and CAT compared to the other salts at a concentration of 0.2% (p < 0.05). These results suggest that at appropriate concentrations, bamboo salt could prevent skin ageing induced by ultraviolet radiation b (UVB) photodamage.

Abstract: The transmittance of a photochromic (PC) window is reduced in sunlight but returns to its original value in the dark similar to photo-sensitive sun glasses. A 30 cm × 30 cm double glazed window containing a PC multi-layer coating on a single glass pane has been developed. A single PC glass pane can be used to build a window with a low heat transfer coefficient, e.g. double or triple glazed unit, using existing technology. To develop the PC glass with a multi-layered coating that combines chromogenic and photoactive materials we employed sol-gel chemistry approaches and up-scaled the synthesis. Double glazed windows have been assembled using PC glass with two different layer configurations. The transmittance (Tvis) was reduced from 76% to 35% under outdoor solar radiation (750 W/m2) within 15 min.

Abstract: Efficient solar-driven evaporation has engendered great interests as a sustainable and environmental approach for solar energy utilization. The development of high-performance photo-absorbers is of paramount importance for realizing efficient solar evaporation. Among the light-harvesting materials, transition metal oxide (TMO) is regarded as one of the most promising substitutes for photothermal conversion. Here, two-dimensional (2D) defective tungsten oxide (WOx) nanosheets are prepared via introducing oxygen vacancies in WO3. It demonstrates that the novel 2D plasmonic WOx nanosheets can be used as high performance photo-absorbers for efficient solar steam generation, displaying broadband and intense light absorption in the full solar spectrum due to the tunable localized surface plasmon resonances. Its evaporation efficiency reaches ~ 78.6% under 1 kW/m2 (one sun) irradiation. The result reveals that adjusting the surface nanostructures and morphologies of TMO can be thought to be a potential strategy to promote the light-harvesting performance for solar steam generation. This study is significant for further exploring potential applications of plasmonic semiconductors in sterilization, desalination, and photothermal power through solar steam generation.

Abstract: Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), a promising renewable energy technology, involves methods to concentrate the sun's energy onto receiver systems that generate steam, activate turbines, and consequently generate electrical power. To ensure CSP technologies remain cost-competitive, absorber coatings on CSP receiver systems require performance enhancements for increasing solar-thermal energy conversion efficiency. In this work, black metal-oxide nanoparticles comprising copper-cobalt oxides (CuxCo3−xO4) and copper-manganese oxides (CuxMn3−xO4) are synthesized for solar absorptive potential by hydrothermal syntheses – selected for low-cost, energy-efficient fabrication capable for bulk manufacturability. The material is deposited onto high-temperature, durable Inconel substrates by a flexible spray-coating method, and characterization is performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) analyses, as well as measurements to gauge thermal performance. High temperature stability of a model solar receiver surface using these synthesized materials are assessed by comparing spectral reflectance and a figure-of-merit efficiency metric before and after high temperature exposure beyond 1000 h. To extend spectrally-selective absorbance capability, the coating surfaces are geometrically-textured using sacrificial polymer beads that are jointly implemented in the spray-coating process. This study ultimately showcases materials produced with high figure-of-merit conversion efficiency, demonstrating solar absorber coatings capable of interfacing with next-generation CSP receiver systems.

Abstract: This research article studied absorption coefficient dependent losses and efficiency of thin film luminescent solar concentrator (LSC). The optimum absorption coefficient was determined by fabricating red dye doped thin film LSCs with varying absorption coefficients of 24–202 cm-1. The optical, electrical, and ray-trace model predicted results were compared to establish the optimum absorption coefficient for fabricated thin film LSCs. The optical and electrical efficiencies of thin film LSCs are a function of absorption coefficient; follow linearly at lower values, gradually becoming non- linear at higher values of absorption coefficient which restricts the overall efficiency. The multi layered ray–trace model predicted results deviated from the experimental results at high absorption coefficient. Non-linearity was introduced by losses mechanism of re-absorption, resonant energy transfer (RET), and scattering in thin film LSCs. Re-absorption losses were found to be dependent on optical path-length and absorption coefficient of thin film. They were identified and quantified through locally collected emission and optical path-length in thin film LSCs. Re-absorption losses caused a red shift in emission peak by ≈ 20 nm as the absorption coefficient increased from 24 to 202 cm-1. RET decreased fluorescence life time of dye from 5 ns to 2 ns for the absorption coefficient increased from 24–202 cm-1. These absorption coefficient dependent losses limit the optical and electrical efficiency of thin film LSC devices, and compared with bulk LSC.

Abstract: In this work, polyethylene glycol (PEG) based polyurethane copolymer was synthesized using linear chain extension and branching methods. In linear chain extension, multiple PEG molecules were linked using urethane bonds. In branching, polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) backbone was grafted with PEG molecules as branches and cross-linked to other PVOH molecules. 4,4′-Diphenylmethane di-isocyanate (MDI) was used as both chain extender and cross-linker. The resulting copolymers were characterized for chemical composition, microscopic morphology, crystalloid structure and thermal properties. Based on the results from characterizations, a detailed discussion on the phase change mechanism in polyurethanes is presented. 1H NMR and FT-IR results confirmed the chain extension and branching. 1H NMR spectra displayed characteristic signal of the urethane. DSC results revealed solid-solid phase change behavior of copolymers with high latent heat. Crystalline nature of spherulite lamellae structures was verified by observing birefringence using POM microscope and XRD peaks. Polyurethane copolymers had maximum latent heat absorption capacity of 144.14 kJ kg−1 at melting temperature of 51 ℃ and had maximum heat release capacity of 117.5 kJ kg−1 at freezing temperature of 33 ℃. Polyurethane copolymers were thermally stable up to 200 ℃. Polyurethane copolymers satisfied all criteria for use as form stable solid-solid phase change material (SSPCM) in solar thermal conversion storage.

Abstract: Lymphangiogenesis has been regarded as a physiological response to pathologic stimuli. The abnormal proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cell (LECs) and lymphangiogenesis is involved in the development of lymphatic disorders. Reportedly, VEGFC/VEGFR3 plays a key role in lymphangiogenesis; moreover, VEGFC/VEGFR3 exerts their cellular effects through activation of Ca2+ signaling in several cell types. Herein, we demonstrated that VEGFC significantly up-regulated LEC proliferation through VEGFR3; moreover, VEGFC/VEGFR3 induced Ca2+ signaling activation. By using online tools, miR-128 and miR-3916 were predicted as candidate upstream miRNAs which might target VEGFC/VEGFR3. As verified using Immunoblotting assays, miR-128 significantly regulated the protein levels of VEGFC/VEGFR3, whereas miR-3916 only slightly modulated VEGFC and VEGFR3 proteins. Contrary to VEGFC, miR-128 overexpression remarkably suppressed LEC proliferation, Ca2+ release and ERK1/2-Akt signaling; moreover, the effect of VEGFC could be partially attenuated by miR-128. In summary, miR-128 interacts with the 3′-UTR of VEGFC and VEGFR3 to inhibit their expression, thus suppressing LEC proliferation through Ca2+ and ERK1/2-Akt signaling. Taken together, we provided novel experimental basis for miRNA-regulated LEC proliferation through Ca2+ signaling.

Abstract: A new type of microcapsule based on n-octadecane core and poly(melamine-formaldehyde)/silicon carbide (PMF/SiC) shell was designed for near-infrared light harvesting, light-heat conversion, thermal energy storage and heat-transfer enhancement. A series of hybrid microcapsules were successfully synthesized through in situ polymerization in an oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by sodium salt of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer and SiC synergistically. The scanning electron microscopic investigation revealed that the microcapsules presented regular spherical morphology. The chemical compositions and crystalline structures of the resultant microcapsules were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction, confirming that SiC nanoparticles have been embedded in the PMF shell. Thermogravimetric analysis and a temperature-regulated test indicated that the prepared microcapsules possessed high thermal stability and good thermoregulating ability. Differential scanning calorimetry examination showed that the resulting hybrid microcapsules can maintain high effective core content and high encapsulation efficiency, and the supercooling crystallization was obviously suppressed after the incorporation of nano-SiC. Compared with PMF microcapsules, thermal transfer properties of the PMF/SiC microcapsules were significantly improved, and the thermal conductivity increased by 60.34% after the addition of 7% nano-SiC. Furthermore, the synthesized hybrid microcapsules effectively absorbed near-infrared light and demonstrated good photothermal conversion performance under light radiation.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) are the most promising quaternary earth abundant photo-absorber materials for thin film solar cells, with reported power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of more than 12%. In CZTS and CZTSSe based solar cells, similar atomic sizes of Cu and Zn is thought to be the main reason for CuZn and ZnCu antisite defect formation, resulted in severe potential fluctuations and tail states that can be inhibited by an incorporation of alternative bigger atoms such as Cd and Mn. In addition, the large open-circuit voltage deficit observed in CZTS and CZTSe device because of existence of Cu and Zn cation disorder in kesterite crystal. Recently, in the development of CZTS based thin film solar cells the reduction of antisite defects by cation substitution has received considerable attention. This also opens up the possibility to explore materials with similar crystal structures and band gaps as CZTS/CZTSSe such as Cu2XSnS4 (where X = Mn, Cd, Fe, Co, Ni and Ba). In this review, the effect of substituting other metals for Zn is discussed, providing a way to alter defects and tail states in the absorber material of CZTS/CZTSSe thin film solar cells.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells have been fabricated by various methods. Sputtering is one of the vacuum processes that can be used for the growth of the precursors. In this study, CZTSSe thin-films that were fabricated using metal-precursors and with a high efficiency of 12.3% were examined in a comparison with CZTSSe thin-films that were fabricated using compound-precursors, whose efficiency is 9.1%. Especially, the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis and local current measurement by conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) show that their local electrical properties indicate completely opposite results. The grain boundaries (GBs) has a downward surface potential bending, and this repelled the minority carriers into the intragrains (IGs) in the sample from the metal-precursors. Therefore, we originally verified the differences between the carrier behaviors and the current flows on the surface.

Abstract: Background
Both LncRNA UCA1 and miR-495 are crucial gene regulators in various disorders. This study aims to investigate their role in epilepsy and seizure-induced brain injury.
Methods
In this research, rat model of epilepsy was established by pilocarpine induction. The RNA and protein expression in hippocampal tissues and neurons were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The hippocampal neurons were isolated from hippocampal tissues, and treated with magnesium-free (MGF) physiological solution for epileptiform activity induction. The endogenous expression of related genes was modulated by recombinant plasmids and cell transfection. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell apoptosis. Dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the interaction between miR-495 and Nrf2 in HEK-293 cells.
Results
The lncRNA UCA1 and Nrf2 were down-regulated in epileptiform hippocampal tissues and neurons, while the miR-495 was up-regulated. Over-expression of UCA1 inhibited apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by suppressing miR-495. MiR-495 negatively regulated Nrf2. UCA1 inhibited apoptosis of hippocampal neurons through miR-495/Nrf2-ARE pathway. UCA1 suppressed pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in rat.
Conclusion
LncRNA UCA1 suppressed pilocarpine-induced epilepsy by inhibiting apoptosis of hippocampal neurons through miR-495/Nrf2-ARE pathway, and thereby inhibiting brain injury induced by seizure.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells secrete diffusible factors into the microenvironment that bind to specific endothelial cell receptors and initiate an angiogenesis cascade. Tumor-induced angiogenesis is an important parameter of tumorigenesis and is critical for tumor growth and metastasis. A pvrl-4 encoded gene, NECTIN-4, has potential roles in cancer cell growth and aggressiveness, and it is only expressed in cancer cells. There is evidence that nectin-4 plays a role in tumorigenesis, but the function of nectin-4 in tumor angiogenesis has lacked thorough evidence of mechanism. Using highly metastatic breast cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we have developed an excellent angiogenesis model and systematically studied the contribution of nectin-4 to angiogenesis. We also provide in-depth in ovo, in vivo and in vivo evidence that nectin-4 causes angiogenesis. Following hypoxia, metastatic breast cancer stem cells (mBCSCs) driven ADAM-17 expression causes the shedding of the ecto-domain of nectin-4 into the microenvironment, which physically interacts with integrin-β4 specifically on endothelial cells. This interaction promotes angiogenesis via the Src, PI3K, AKT, iNOS pathway and not by Phospho-Erk or NF-κβ pathways. In vitro, in ovo and in vivo induction and abrogation of an angiogenesis cascade in the presence and absence of the nectin-4 ecto-domain, respectively, confirms its role in angiogenesis. Thus, disrupting the interaction between nectin-4 ecto-domain and integrin-β4 may provide a means of targeting mBCSC-induced angiogenesis.

Abstract: Background
High dose Cyclophosphamide (Cy) and Vinorelbine Cyclophosphamide (Vino-Cy) are stem cell (SC) mobilisation options for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). We present a comparison of mobilisation outcomes using these regimens.
Patients and methods
Vino-Cy patients received Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 on day 1, cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m2 on day 2, and pegylated GCSF on day 4 or GCSF 10 mcg/kg/day from day 4 onwards. Cy patients were given cyclophosphamide 4000 mg/m2 on day 1 and GCSF10 mcg/kg/day from day 5 onwards. The target CD34 + SC collection was 5 × 106 per kg/BW.
Results
149 patients were included. SC collection was lower in the Vino-Cy group (8.20 × 106/Kg BW) compared to the Cy group (11.43 × 106/Kg BW), with adjusted geometric mean ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.86, p = 0.006). Time taken to achieve an adequate PB SC count was shorter for Vino-Cy (9 ± 1 day compared to 12 ± 2 days for Cy, adjusted absolute mean difference −3.95, 95% CI −4.85 to −3.06, P < .001). Mobilisation related toxicities (in particular, neutropaenic fever) were greater for Cy.
Conclusion
Vino-Cy is a potential alternative to Cy given the need for effective mobilisation protocols with acceptable toxicity.

Abstract: Room-temperature direct current magnetron sputtering was employed to prepare pristine and Cu+ doped NiOx films for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 15% was obtained with a 20 nm thick film with copper content of 5.7%. The solar cells based on as sputtered films demonstrated high reproducibility and stability. The origin of dramatically boosted photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on Cu doped NiOx was analysed from energy loss considerations. The optical, carrier transport as well as recombination losses were discussed. According to our results, PSC with Cu doped NiOx have lower recombination and transport loss which ensured the hysteresis free high efficiency.

Abstract: The optimization of solar cells properties with thermal criteria gives the possibility to achieve higher conversion efficiency in outdoor conditions. An innovative setup that allows the control of the surroundings of a solar cell is described. Under such specific conditions, the cell temperature can be stabilized and measured. The variation of the cell temperature with the applied bias is experimentally observed and quantified. Between short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc), a slight difference of temperature is observed, revealing a variation of the thermal equilibrium between these two points. The resistivity of the absorber and the input power density are found to influence this temperature shift. From the experimental results, it appears that the emissivity of the solar cell increases with the applied voltage due to an increase in the excess carrier concentration. Consequently, the operating temperature at open-circuit is lower than at short-circuit.
