Abstract: Myogenesis occurs during embryonic development as well as regeneration following postnatal muscle fiber damage. Herein, we show that acidic calponin or calponin 3 (CNN3) regulates both myoblast cell fusion and muscle-specific gene expressions. Overexpression of CNN3 impaired C2C12 cell fusion, whereas CNN3 gene knockdown promoted skeletal myosin expression and fusion. CNN3 was phosphorylated at Ser293/296 in the C-terminal region. The basal inhibitory property of CNN3 against myoblast differentiation was enhanced by Ser293/296Ala mutation or deletion of the C-terminal region, and this inhibition was reversed by Ser293/296Asp mutation. Ser293/296 phosphorylation was required for CNN3 to bind actin and was dependent on Rho-associated kinases 1/2 (ROCK 1/2). Gene knockdown of ROCK1/2 suppressed CNN3 phosphorylation and impaired myoblast fusion, and these effects were partially attenuated by additional CNN3 overexpression of Ser293/296Asp CNN3. These findings indicated that CNN3 phosphorylation by ROCK blunts CNN3's inhibitory effects on muscle cell differentiation and fusion. In muscle tissues, satellite cells, but not mature myofibrils, expressed CNN3. CNN3 was also expressed and phosphorylated during myotube induction in isolated muscle satellite cells. Taken together, these results indicate that CNN3 is a downstream regulator of the ROCK signaling pathway for myogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Diminished mitochondrial function is causally related to some heart diseases. Here, we developed a human disease model based on cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), in which an important pathway of mitochondrial gene expression was inactivated. Repression of PGC-1α, which is normally induced during development of cardiomyocytes, decreased mitochondrial content and activity and decreased the capacity for coping with energetic stress. Yet, concurrently, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were lowered, and the amplitude of the action potential and the maximum amplitude of the calcium transient were in fact increased. Importantly, in control cardiomyocytes, lowering ROS levels emulated this beneficial effect of PGC-1α knockdown and similarly increased the calcium transient amplitude. Our results suggest that controlling ROS levels may be of key physiological importance for recapitulating mature cardiomyocyte phenotypes, and the combination of bioassays used in this study may have broad application in the analysis of cardiac physiology pertaining to disease.

Abstract: We evaluated associations between the concentrations of heat shock proteins (hsp60 and hsp70) and their respective antibodies, alterations in maternal reproductive performance, and fetal malformations in pregnant rats with hyperglycemia. Mild diabetes (MD) or severe diabetes (SD) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats prior to mating; non-treated non-diabetic rats (ND) served as controls. On day 21 of pregnancy, maternal blood was analyzed for hsp60 and hsp70 and their antibodies; and fetuses were weighed and analyzed for congenital malformations. Hsp and anti-hsp levels were correlated with blood glucose levels during gestation. There was a positive correlation between hsp60 and hsp70 levels and the total number of malformations (R = 0.5908, P = 0.0024; R = 0.4877, P = 0.0134, respectively) and the number of malformations per fetus (R = 0.6103, P = 0.0015; R = 0.4875, P = 0.0134, respectively). The anti-hsp60 IgG concentration was correlated with the number of malformations per fetus (R = 0.3887, P = 0.0451) and the anti-hsp70 IgG level correlated with the total number of malformations (R = 0.3999, P = 0.0387). Moreover, both hsp and anti-hsp antibodies showed negative correlations with fetal weight. The results suggest that there is a relationship between hsp60 and hsp70 levels and their respective antibodies and alterations in maternal reproductive performance and impaired fetal development and growth in pregnancies associated with diabetes.

Abstract: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a congenital heart condition in which the right ventricle is exposed to cyanosis and pressure overload. Patients have an increased risk of right ventricle dysfunction following corrective surgery. Whether the cyanotic myocardium is less tolerant of injury compared to non-cyanotic is unclear. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) protect against cellular stresses. The aim of this study was to examine HSP 27 expression in the right ventricle resected from TOF patients and determine its relationship with right ventricle function and clinical outcome. Ten cyanotic and ten non-cyanotic patients were studied. Western blotting was used to quantify HSP 27 in resected myocardium at (1) baseline (first 15 min of aortic cross clamp and closest representation of pre-operative status) and (2) after 15 min during ischemia until surgery was complete. The cyanotic group had significantly increased haematocrit, lower O2 saturation, thicker interventricular septal wall thickness and released more troponin-I on post-operative day 1 (p < 0.05). HSP 27 expression was significantly increased in the <15 min cyanotic compared to the <15 min non-cyanotic group (p = 0.03). In the cyanotic group, baseline HSP 27 expression also significantly correlated with oxygen extraction ratio (p = 0.028), post-operative basal septal velocity (p = 0.036) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (p = 0.02), markers of improved cardiac output/contraction. Increased HSP 27 expression and associated improved right ventricle function and systemic perfusion supports a cardio-protective effect of HSP 27 in cyanotic TOF.

Abstract: Levels of serum heat shock protein 27 (sHsp27) have been studied in numerous cancer types, but their potential relevance in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is undetermined. Our aim was to compare sHsp27 levels in patients with HCC and HCC-free controls. Specifically, we recruited 71 patients with HCC (80 % with early tumour), 80 patients with chronic liver disease (59 with liver cirrhosis and 21 with chronic active hepatitis) and 42 healthy subjects. sHsp27 was measured by immunoenzymatic assay. Results showed that sHsp27 levels were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in patients with HCC than in the other groups, particularly in those with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related disease. In HCC patients, sHsp27 levels were not associated with prognostic risk factors, such as size/multiplicity of nodules and stage. In logistic regression analysis, performed in patients with liver disease, log-sHsp27 was associated with a significant age-adjusted 2.5-fold increased odds ratio of HCC and with a significant 4.4-fold higher odds ratio of HCC in the subgroup with HCV-related liver disease. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivity and specificity of the best sHsp27 cut-off value (456.5 pg/ml) for differentiating patients with HCC from those with HCC-free chronic liver disease were 70 and 73 %, respectively. In conclusion, sHsp27 levels are enhanced in patients with HCC and may represent a candidate biomarker of HCC.

Abstract: An understanding of the molecular mechanism behind the arrhythmic phenotype associated with laminopathies has yet to emerge. A-type lamins have been shown to interact and sequester activated phospho-ERK1/2(pERK1/2) at the nucleus. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) can be phosphorylated by pERK1/2 on S279/282 (pS279/282), inhibiting intercellular communication. We hypothesized that without A-type lamins, pS279/282 Cx43 will increase due to inappropriate phosphorylation by pERK1/2, resulting in decreased gap junction function. We observed a 1.6-fold increase in pS279/282 Cx43 levels in Lmna−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to Lmna+/+, and 1.8-fold more pERK1/2 co-precipitated from Lmna−/− MEFs with Cx43 antibodies. We found a 3-fold increase in the fraction of non-nuclear pERK1/2 and a concomitant 2-fold increase in the fraction of pS279/282 Cx43 in Lmna−/− MEFs by immunofluorescence. In an assay of gap junctional function, Lmna−/− MEFs transferred dye to 60% fewer partners compared to Lmna+/+ controls. These results are mirrored in 5–6 week-old Lmna−/− mice compared to their Lmna+/+ littermates as we detect increased pS279/282 Cx43 in gap junctions by immunofluorescence and 1.7-fold increased levels by immunoblot. We conclude that increased pS279/282 Cx43 in the Lmna−/− background results in decreased cell communication and may contribute to the arrhythmic pathology in vivo.

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells offering valuable hopes for the treatment of degenerative diseases. MSCs can be found among differentiated cells in many tissues and organs but, unfortunately, their phenotypic similarity hinders a robust cell characterization and discrimination from diverse tissue harvests. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial managers of gene expression with intriguing and still poorly known roles in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. To identify miRNAs that can discriminate among MSCs, we performed a whole-genome comparative miRNA expression profiling analysis on adipose (AD), bone marrow (BM) and cord blood (CB) derived MSCs, all three considered among the most promising in the field of regenerative medicine. miRNA expression patterns were very similar, meeting their extensive phenotypic and functional overlaps. An in-depth comparison of the few most differentially expressed miRNAs allowed the identification of a highly restricted molecular signature consisting of 5 BMMSC, 11 ADMSC and 11 CBMSC specific miRNAs. Functional analysis of their validated targets allowed the identification of an “environmental-niche memory” for BMMSC and an “epithelial” commitment for ADMSC, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms discriminating between these MSCs, a crucial element to identify the most appropriate stem cell source for clinical application.

Abstract: Two porphyrins, CoTPPS and MnTMPyPCl5, were tested for their photodynamic activity and potential novel use in a therapy of human cancers. We investigated an effect of photodynamic reaction (PDR), electroporation (EP) and their combination (electro-photodynamic reaction [EP-PDR]) on human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (LoVo and resistant to doxorubicin LoVoDX), human breast adenocarcinoma (wild type MCF-7/WT and resistant to doxorubicin MCF-7/DOX), and human melanoma (Me45). The efficiency of macromolecules transport was examined with cytofluorymetry by assessing the degree of propidium iodide (PI) penetration. Additionally, cellular ultrastructure after EP was evaluated. We determined cyto- and photo-cytotoxic effect on the cells viability (MTT assay) after standard PDR and PDR combined with EP. Intracellular distribution and mitochondrial colocalization of both porphyrins was also performed. The experiments proved that both complexes exhibit desirable photodynamic properties on LoVo LoVoDX cells, and EP effectively supports photodynamic method in this type of cancer. The application of EP provided shorter time of incubation (only 10 min) and enhanced effect of applied therapy. The porphyrins did not affect the MCF-7 and Me45 cell lines.

Abstract: Myosin IC is a single headed member of the myosin superfamily that localizes to the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it is involved in transcription by RNA polymerases I and II, intranuclear transport, and nuclear export. In mammalian cells, three isoforms of myosin IC are expressed that differ only in the addition of short isoform-specific N-terminal peptides. Despite the high sequence homology, the isoforms show differences in cellular distribution, in localization to nuclear substructures, and in their interaction with nuclear proteins through yet unknown mechanisms. In this study, we used EGFP-fusion constructs that express truncated or mutated versions of myosin IC isoforms to detect regions that are involved in isoform-specific localization. We identified two nucleolar localization signals (NoLS). One NoLS is located in the myosin IC isoform B specific N-terminal peptide, the second NoLS is located upstream of the neck region within the head domain. We demonstrate that both NoLS are functional and necessary for nucleolar localization of specifically myosin IC isoform B. Our data provide a first mechanistic explanation for the observed functional differences between the myosin IC isoforms and are an important step toward our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that regulate the various and distinct functions of myosin IC isoforms.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular pathogens modulate host cell function to promote their survival. However, in vitro infection studies do not account for the impact of host-derived inflammatory signals. Examining the response of liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) in mice infected with the parasite Leishmania donovani, we identified a transcriptomic network operating in uninfected Kupffer cells exposed to inflammation but absent from Kupffer cells from the same animal that contained intracellular Leishmania. To test the hypothesis that regulated expression of genes within this transcriptomic network might impact parasite survival, we pharmacologically perturbed the activity of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), a key hub within this network, and showed that this intervention enhanced the innate resistance of Kupffer cells to Leishmania infection. Our results illustrate a broadly applicable strategy for understanding the host response to infection in vivo and identify Rxra as the hub of a gene network controlling antileishmanial resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Gut mucosal barrier breakdown and inflammation have been associated with high levels of flagellin, the principal bacterial flagellar protein. Although several gut commensals can produce flagella, flagellin levels are low in the healthy gut, suggesting the existence of control mechanisms. We find that mice lacking the flagellin receptor Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) exhibit a profound loss of flagellin-specific immunoglobulins (Igs) despite higher total Ig levels in the gut. Ribotyping of IgA-coated cecal microbiota showed Proteobacteria evading antibody coating in the TLR5−/− gut. A diversity of microbiome members overexpressed flagellar genes in the TLR5−/− host. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes penetrated small intestinal villi, and flagellated bacteria breached the colonic mucosal barrier. In vitro, flagellin-specific Ig inhibited bacterial motility and downregulated flagellar gene expression. Thus, innate-immunity-directed development of flagellin-specific adaptive immune responses can modulate the microbiome’s production of flagella in a three-way interaction that helps to maintain mucosal barrier integrity and homeostasis.

Abstract: To develop cell therapies for damaged nervous tissue with human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNPCs), the risk of an immune response and graft rejection must be considered. There are conflicting results and lack of knowledge concerning the immunocompetence of hNPCs of different origin. Here, we studied the immunogenicity and immunomodulatory potentials of hNPCs cultured under equivalent conditions after derivation from human embryonic stem cells (hESC-NPCs) or human fetal spinal cord tissue (hfNPCs). The expression patterns of human leukocyte antigen, co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules in hESC-NPCs and hfNPCs were relatively similar and mostly not affected by inflammatory cytokines. Unstimulated hfNPCs secreted more transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and β2 but similar level of interleukin (IL)-10 compared to hESC-NPCs. In contrast to hfNPCs, hESC-NPCs displayed 4–6 fold increases in TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and IL-10 under inflammatory conditions. Both hNPCs reduced the alloreaction between allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and up-regulated CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ T cells. However, hESC-NPCs but not hfNPCs dose-dependently triggered PBMC proliferation, which at least partly may be due to TGF-β signaling. To conclude, hESC-NPCs and hfNPCs displayed similarities but also significant differences in their immunocompetence and interaction with allogeneic PBMCs, differences may be crucial for the outcome of cell therapy.

S100P/RAGE signaling regulates microRNA-155 expression via AP-1 activation in colon cancer,

Abstract: Accumulating evidence indicates that elevated S100P promotes the pathogenesis of cancers, including colon cancer. S100P exerts its effects by binding to and activating the Receptor for Advance Glycation End-products (RAGE). The effects of up-regulated S100P/RAGE signaling on cell functions are well documented. Despite these observations, little is known about the downstream targets of S100P/RAGE signaling. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that activation of RAGE by S100P regulates oncogenic microRNA-155 (miR-155) expression through Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) stimulation in colon cancer cells. Ectopic S100P up-regulated miR-155 levels in human colon cancer cells. Conversely, knockdown of S100P resulted in a decrease in miR-155 levels. Exogenous S100P induced miR-155 expression, but blockage of the RAGE with anti-RAGE antibody suppressed the induction of miR-155 by exogenous S100P. Attenuation of AP-1 activation through pharmacological inhibition of MEK activation or genetic inhibition of c-Jun activation using dominant negative c-Jun (TAM67) suppressed miR-155 induction by exogenous S100P. Also, S100P treatment stimulated the enrichment of c-Fos, an AP-1 family member, at the miR-155 host gene promoter site. Finally, a functional study demonstrated that miR-155 knockdown decreases colon cancer cell growth, motility, and invasion. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the expression of miR-155 is regulated by S100P and is dependent on RAGE activation and stimulation of AP-1.

Abstract: Regulation of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling in fibrogenesis is complex. Previous work by our lab suggests that ERK MAP kinase phosphorylates the linker region (LR) of Smad3 to enhance TGF-β-induced collagen-I accumulation. However the roles of the individual Smad3LR phosphorylation sites (T179, S204, S208 and S213) in the collagen-I response to TGF-β are not clear. To address this issue, we tested the ability of Smad3 constructs expressing wild-type Smad3 or Smad3 with mutated LR phosphorylation sites to reconstitute TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 promoter activity in Smad3-null or -knockdown cells. Blocking ERK in fibroblasts and renal mesangial cells inhibited both S204 phosphorylation and Smad3-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity. Mutations replacing serine at S204 or S208 in the linker region decreased Smad3-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity, whereas mutating T179 enhanced basal COL1A2 promoter activity and did not prevent TGF-β stimulation. Interestingly, mutation of all four Smad3LR sites (T179, S204, S208 and S213) was not inhibitory, suggesting primacy of the two inhibitory sites. These results suggest that in these mesenchymal cells, phosphorylation of the T179 and possibly S213 sites may act as a brake on the signal, whereas S204 phosphorylation by ERK in some manner releases that brake. Renal epithelial cells (HKC) respond differently from MEF or mesangial cells; blocking ERK neither changed TGF-β-stimulated S204 phosphorylation nor prevented Smad3-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity in HKC. Furthermore, re-expression of wild type-Smad3 or the S204A-Smad3 mutant in Smad3-knockdown HKC reconstituted Smad3-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity. Collectively, these data suggest that Serine-204 phosphorylation in the Smad3LR is a critical event by which ERK enhances Smad3-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity in mesenchymal cells.

Abstract: Extracellular pH (pHe) gradients are characteristic of tumor and wound environments. Cell migration in these environments is critical to tumor progression and wound healing. While it has been shown previously that cell migration can be modulated in conditions of spatially invariant acidic pHe due to acid-induced activation of cell surface integrin receptors, the effects of pHe gradients on cell migration remain unknown. Here, we investigate cell migration in an extracellular pHe gradient, using both model αvβ3 CHO-B2 cells and primary microvascular endothelial cells. For both cell types, we find that the mean cell position shifts toward the acidic end of the gradient over time, and that cells preferentially polarize toward the acidic end of the gradient during migration. We further demonstrate that cell membrane protrusion stability and actin–integrin adhesion complex formation are increased in acidic pHe, which could contribute to the preferential polarization toward acidic pHe that we observed for cells in pHe gradients. These results provide the first demonstration of preferential cell migration toward acid in a pHe gradient, with intriguing implications for directed cell migration in the tumor and wound healing environments.

Abstract: Chronic arsenic toxicity is a global health problem that affects more than 100 million people worldwide. Long-term health effects of inorganic sodium arsenite in drinking water may result in skin, lung and liver cancers and in severe neurological abnormalities. We investigated in the present study whether sodium arsenite affects signaling pathways that control cell survival, proliferation and neuronal differentiation of human neural stem cells (NSC). We demonstrated that the critical signaling pathway, which was suppressed by sodium arsenite in NSC, was the protective PI3K–AKT pathway. Sodium arsenite (2–4μM) also caused down-regulation of Nanog, one of the key transcription factors that control pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells. Mitochondrial damage and cytochrome-c release induced by sodium arsenite exposure was followed by initiation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in NSC. Beside caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibitors, suppression of JNK activity decreased levels of arsenite-induced apoptosis in NSC. Neuronal differentiation of NSC was substantially inhibited by sodium arsenite exposure. Overactivation of JNK1 and ERK1/2 and down-regulation of PI3K–AKT activity induced by sodium arsenite were critical factors that strongly affected neuronal differentiation. In conclusion, sodium arsenite exposure of human NSC induces the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which is substantially accelerated due to the simultaneous suppression of PI3K–AKT. Sodium arsenite also negatively affects neuronal differentiation of NSC through overactivation of MEK–ERK and suppression of PI3K–AKT.

Abstract: Summary
Organ formation and regeneration require epithelial progenitor expansion to engineer, maintain, and repair the branched tissue architecture. Identifying the mechanisms that control progenitor expansion will inform therapeutic organ (re)generation. Here, we discover that combined KIT and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b) signaling specifically increases distal progenitor expansion during salivary gland organogenesis. FGFR2b signaling upregulates the epithelial KIT pathway so that combined KIT/FGFR2b signaling, via separate AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, amplifies FGFR2b-dependent transcription. Combined KIT/FGFR2b signaling selectively expands the number of KIT+K14+SOX10+ distal progenitors, and a genetic loss of KIT signaling depletes the distal progenitors but also unexpectedly depletes the K5+ proximal progenitors. This occurs because the distal progenitors produce neurotrophic factors that support gland innervation, which maintains the proximal progenitors. Furthermore, a rare population of KIT+FGFR2b+ cells is present in adult glands, in which KIT signaling also regulates epithelial-neuronal communication during homeostasis. Our findings provide a framework to direct regeneration of branched epithelial organs.

Abstract: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are heterogeneous populations of immature myeloid cells with strong immunosuppressive function, and play a critical role in the immune evasion of cancer. A subset of MDSCs share many similar characteristics with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), but it is largely unclear whether MDSCs also have M1/M2 type polarization in tumor microenvironments. In the present study, we found that Gr-1+CD115+ monocytes in tumor-bearing mice exhibited M2 characteristics with significantly lower expression of iNOS and higher expression of Arginase I. Immunofluorescence staining showed that Gr-1+CD115+ monocytes in tumor sites from LPS-injected mice had a higher expression of iNOS. Similarly, in vitro experiments displayed that LPS-treated Gr-1+CD115+ cells expressed higher levels of iNOS, IL-6, TNF, IL-12, and IL-10 compared with those in non-treated Gr-1+CD115+ monocytes. Extensive study showed that LPS-treated Gr-1+CD115+ monocytes had less ability to convert the CD4+CD25−cells into CD4+CD25+ Tregs, and also had less suppressive function on CD4+CD25− conventional T cells. LLC tumors in LPS-injected mice grew significantly slower than those in non-LPS-injected mice. Further experiments suggested that LPS may function through the P38 MAPK signaling pathway to increase the expression of iNOS, and of MyD88 independently. Thus, we can get conclusion that Gr-1+CD115+ monocytes in tumor-bearing mice show M2 type characteristics and LPS can skew this M2 type cells into M1 type through the P38 MAPK pathway and lead to inhibition of the suppressive function of Gr-1+CD115+ monocytes. It suggests that LPS or its analogs may be potential drugs for tumor treatment, inflammation induced by LPS or other components of bacterium or virus may be benefit to the inhibition of tumor cell growth in vivo.

Abstract: Identification of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP) substrates is critical in understanding cellular role in normal cells as well as cancer cells. We have previously shown that reduction of PTPL1 protein levels in Ewings sarcoma (ES) inhibit cell growth and tumorigenesis. Therefore, we sought to identify novel PTPL1 substrates that may be important for tumorigenesis. In this current work, we demonstrated that mouse embryonic fibroblasts without PTPL1 catalytic activity fail to form foci when transfected with oncogenes. We proved that catalytic activity of PTPL1 is important for ES cell growth. Using a substrate-trapping mutant of PTPL1 we identified putative PTPL1 substrates by mass-spectrometry. One of these putative substrates was characterized as Valosin Containing Protein (VCP/p97). Using multiple biochemical assays we validated VCP as a novel substrate of PTPL1. We also provide evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP might be important for its midbody localization during cytokinesis. In conclusion, our work identifies VCP as a new substrate for PTPL1, which may be important in cellular transformation. Our investigation link an oncogenic transcription factor EWS-FLI1, with a key transcriptional target protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPL1, and its substrate VCP. Given our observation that PTPL1 catalytic activity is important for cell transformation, our results may also suggest that VCP regulation by PTPL1 might be important for tumorigenesis.

The Src homology 2 protein Shb promotes cell cycle progression in murine hematopoietic stem cells by regulation of focal adhesion kinase activity,

Abstract: The widely expressed adaptor protein Shb has previously been reported to contribute to T cell function due to its association with the T cell receptor and furthermore, several of Shb's known interaction partners are established regulators of blood cell development and function. In addition, Shb deficient embryonic stem cells displayed reduced blood cell colony formation upon differentiation in vitro. The aim of the current study was therefore to explore hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function in the Shb knockout mouse. Shb deficient bone marrow contained reduced relative numbers of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) that exhibited lower proliferation rates. Despite this, Shb knockout LT-HSCs responded promptly by entering the cell cycle in response to genotoxic stress by 5-fluorouracil treatment. In competitive LT-HSC transplantations, Shb null cells initially engrafted as well as the wild-type cells but provided less myeloid expansion over time. Moreover, Shb knockout bone marrow cells exhibited elevated basal activities of focal adhesion kinase/Rac1/p21-activated kinase signaling and reduced responsiveness to Stem Cell Factor stimulation. Consequently, treatment with a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor increased Shb knockout LT-HSC proliferation. The altered signaling characteristics thus provide a plausible mechanistic explanation for the changes in LT-HSC proliferation since these signaling intermediates have all been shown to participate in LT-HSC cell cycle control. In summary, the loss of Shb dependent signaling in bone marrow cells, resulting in elevated focal adhesion kinase activity and reduced proliferative responses in LT-HSCs under steady state hematopoiesis, confers a disadvantage to the maintenance of LT-HSCs over time.

Abstract: Paired box gene 1 (Pax1) indirectly promotes the early stages of chondrogenic differentiation through induction and transactivation of Nk3 homeobox 2 (Nkx3.2), a transcriptional repressor. Later in chondrogenic differentiation, Nkx3.2 blocks chondrocyte hypertrophy by repressing Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Here we report the inhibitory action of Pax1 on chondrocyte maturation, independently of Nkx3.2. Upon cartilage formation, Pax1 expression in the ventral sclerotome was gradually decreased except for the perichondrial region of the vertebral bodies and the intervertebral region, both of which express SRY-box containing gene 9 (Sox9). Forced expression of Pax1 in the chick forelimb resulted in the formation of shortened skeletal elements with a significant reduction of proteoglycans (PGs) accumulation in cartilage as well as a lack of the cortical bone formation and vascular invasion into the primary ossification center. Pax1-misexpressing chondrocytes exhibited aberrant cell morphology with a marked downregulation of Aggrecan (Agc1). Pax1-misexpressing cultured chondrocytes failed to accumulate cartilaginous PGs and became fibroblastic, in association with downregulation of the expression of Sox9, Nkx3.2, Indian hedgehog (Ihh), type II collagen (Col2a1), Chondromodulin-1 (Chm1), and Agc1. Accumulation of cartilaginous PGs in chondrocytes was also reduced by forced expression of Pax1 and Sox9. Thus, chondrocyte maturation driven by Sox9 is antagonized by Pax1 that is downregulated during chondrogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Transcription factor STAT3 (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3) is persistently active in human tumors and may contribute to tumor progression. Inhibition of STAT3 expression/activity could be a good strategy to modulate tumor cell survival and responses to cancer chemotherapeutics or immune cytotoxicity. We silenced STAT3 expression in human A549 lung cancer cells to elucidate its role in cell survival and resistance to chemotherapeutics, TNFα and natural killer (NK)-mediated cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that STAT3 is not essential for basal survival and proliferation of A549 cancer cells. Stable silencing of STAT3 expression sensitized A549 cells to DNA damaging chemotherapeutics doxorubicin and cisplatin in a p53-independent manner. Sensitization to DNA damage-inducing chemotherapeutics could be due to down-regulation of the Bcl-xL expression in STAT3 depleted cells. In contrast, knockdown of STAT3 in cancer cells did not modulate responses to TNFα and NK-mediated cytotoxicity. We found that STAT3 depletion increased the NFκB activity likely providing the compensatory, pro-survival signal. The treatment with TNFα, but not doxorubicin, enhanced this effect. We conclude that STAT3 is not crucial for the control of basal cell proliferation and survival of lung carcinoma cells but modulates susceptibility to DNA damaging chemotherapeutics by regulation of intrinsic pro-survival pathways.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) mediates interactions between integrin and growth factor receptor (GFR) or ion channel. Although this crosstalk promotes integration of the downstream signal pathways and then regulates cellular function, the effect of ECM on glucose transporter (GLUT) in stem cells has not been elucidated. Therefore, we examined the effect of fibronectin on GLUT-1 expression, trafficking, and its related signal pathways in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Fibronectin increased 2-deoxyglucose (DG) uptake and GLUT-1 protein expression that were blocked by transcription or translation inhibitors. Integrin α5β1-bound fibronectin increased 2-DG uptake through cluster formation with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2, and then activated Ras and PI3K/Akt. In another pathway, integrin α5β1 displayed structural and functional interactions with calcium channels, and stimulated 2-DG uptake through calcium influx and PKC activation. Akt and PKC-induced PPARγ phosphorylation enhanced the decreased expression of PPARγ protein, and subsequently increased GLUT-1 protein synthesis and 2-DG uptake. Fibronectin stimulated TC10 activity and cytoskeleton (F-actin) rearrangement, followed by GLUT-1 trafficking. In conclusion, integrin-bound fibronectin stimulates GLUT-1 synthesis through VEGFR2/Ras/PI3K/Akt and calcium channel/Ca2+/PKC, which are merged at PPARγ and GLUT-1 trafficking through TC10 and F-actin.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are a subset of immune effectors that directly bind and kill fungi via a perforin-dependent mechanism. The receptor mediating this activity and its potential role in disease remain unknown. Using an unbiased approach, we determined that NKp30 is responsible for recognition and killing of the fungal pathogens Cryptococcus and Candida. NKp30 was required for NK cell-fungal conjugate formation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, and perforin release. Because fungal infections are a leading cause of death in AIDS patients, we examined NKp30 expression in HIV-infected patients. NK cells from these patients had diminished NKp30 expression, defective perforin release, and blunted microbicidal activity. Surprisingly, interleukin-12 (IL-12) restored NKp30 expression and fungal killing. Thus, the NKp30 receptor plays a critical role in NK cell antifungal cytotoxicity, and diminished expression of NKp30 is responsible for defective antifungal activity of NK cells from HIV-infected patients, which can be corrected with IL-12.

miR-210 suppresses BNIP3 to protect against the apoptosis of neural progenitor cells,

Abstract: MiR-210 is a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 target gene and is the most consistently and predominantly upregulated miRNA in response to hypoxia in various cancer cell lines. Our recent study shows that hypoxia increased miR-210 expression in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in a time-dependent manner. However, the role of miR-210 in NPCs remains unknown. Following the identification of the miR-210 putative target genes, we demonstrated that the Bcl-2 adenovirus E1B 19kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), which is regulated by HIF-1 and activates cell death, is regulated by miR-210 in NPCs under hypoxia. Moreover, the over-expression of miR-210 decreased apoptosis in NPCs, and the inhibition of miR-210 expression remarkably increased the number of TUNEL-positive NPCs by 30% in response to hypoxia. Importantly, miR-210 mimics reduced both BNIP3 protein expression and the translocation of AIF into the nucleus, which reduced cell death, whereas miR-210 inhibitors reversed this process, leading to cell death during hypoxia. Taken together, we report a novel feedback loop of BNIP3 regulation in NPCs under hypoxia. HIF-1 is activated under hypoxia and then induces the expression of both BNIP3 and miR-210. The upregulation of miR-210 then directly suppresses BNIP3 expression to maintain the survival of NPCs under hypoxia. This negative feedback regulation might partially contribute to protection against hypoxia-induced cell death via the inhibition of AIF nuclear translocation.

Abstract: Summary
The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes serious human infections, but effective treatments and the mechanisms mediating pathogenesis remain elusive. Caenorhabditis elegans shares innate immune pathways with humans, making it invaluable to investigate infection. To determine how P. aeruginosa disrupts host biology, we studied how P. aeruginosa kills C. elegans in a liquid-based pathogenesis model. We found that P. aeruginosa-mediated killing does not require quorum-sensing pathways or host colonization. A chemical genetic screen revealed that iron chelators alleviate P. aeruginosa-mediated killing. Consistent with a role for iron in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, the bacterial siderophore pyoverdin was required for virulence and was sufficient to induce a hypoxic response and death in the absence of bacteria. Loss of the C. elegans hypoxia-inducing factor HIF-1, which regulates iron homeostasis, exacerbated P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, further linking hypoxia and killing. As pyoverdin is indispensable for virulence in mice, pyoverdin-mediated hypoxia is likely to be relevant in human pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-fate decisions and pluripotency are dependent on networks of key transcriptional regulators. Recent reports demonstrated additional functions of pluripotency-associated factors during early lineage commitment. The T-box transcription factor TBX3 has been implicated in regulating embryonic stem cell self-renewal and cardiogenesis. Here, we show that TBX3 is dynamically expressed during specification of the mesendoderm lineages in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro and in developing mouse and Xenopus embryos in vivo. Forced TBX3 expression in ESCs promotes mesendoderm specification by directly activating key lineage specification factors and indirectly by enhancing paracrine Nodal/Smad2 signaling. TBX3 loss-of-function analyses in the Xenopus underline its requirement for mesendoderm lineage commitment. Moreover, we uncovered a functional redundancy between TBX3 and Tbx2 during Xenopus gastrulation. Taken together, we define further facets of TBX3 actions and map TBX3 as an upstream regulator of the mesendoderm transcriptional program during gastrulation.

Abstract: Summary
Leishmania donovani causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL) where the parasite infects and resides inside liver and spleen tissue macrophages. Given the abnormal lipid profile observed in VL patients, we examined the status of serum lipids in an experimental murine model of VL. The murine VL liver displayed altered expression of lipid metabolic genes, many of which are direct or indirect targets of the liver-specific microRNA-122. Concomitant reduction of miR-122 expression was observed in VL liver. High serum cholesterol caused resistance to L. donovani infection, while downregulation of miR-122 is coupled with low serum cholesterol in VL mice. Exosomes secreted by the infective parasites caused reduction in miR-122 activity in hepatic cells. Leishmania surface glycoprotein gp63, a Zn-metalloprotease, targets pre-miRNA processor Dicer1 to prevent miRNP formation in L. donovani-interacting hepatic cells. Conversely, restoration of miR-122 or Dicer1 levels in VL mouse liver increased serum cholesterol and reduced liver parasite burden.

Abstract: Summary
“Triple-defective” (3d) mice carrying a mutation in UNC93B1, a chaperone for the endosomal nucleic acid-sensing (NAS) Toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9, are highly susceptible to Toxoplasma gondii infection. However, none of the single or even the triple NAS-TLR-deficient animals recapitulated the 3d susceptible phenotype to experimental toxoplasmosis. Investigating this further, we found that while parasite RNA and DNA activate innate immune responses via TLR7 and TLR9, TLR11 and TLR12 working as heterodimers are required for sensing and responding to Toxoplasma profilin. Consequently, the triple TLR7/TLR9/TLR11-deficient mice are highly susceptible to T. gondii infection, recapitulating the phenotype of 3d mice. Humans lack functional TLR11 and TLR12 genes. Consistently, human cells produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in response to parasite-derived RNA and DNA, but not to Toxoplasma profilin, supporting a more critical role for NAS-TLRs in human toxoplasmosis.

Abstract: Adipogenesis is the process of cell differentiation by which mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) become adipocytes. Investigating the transcriptional regulatory process during adipogenesis may provide strategies to prevent obesity and other metabolic disorders. In recent years, numerous zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) have been implicated in regulating differentiation and cell fate determination. To investigate the regulatory role of ZFPs involved in adipogenesis, we performed genome-wide microarray expression profiling of an adipogenesis time series. Particularly focusing on the transiently responsive ZFPs, we identified and characterized the functional role of ZNF395 in adipogenesis. A systematic ablation of the ZNF395 transcript during adipogenesis revealed 40% reduction of adipocytes when compared to control. Furthermore, the number of adipocytes as well as the expression of key adipocyte markers were greatly induced when MSC were co-transduced with ZNF395 and PPARG2. To further elucidate the functional role of ZNF395 during adipogenesis, we attempted to trans-differentiate human dermal fibroblasts with PPARG2. The test remarkably revealed that ZNF395 in conjunction with PPARG2 greatly induced adipogenesis from dermal fibroblasts when compared to PPARG2 alone. These loss and gain of function experiments firmly establish that ZNF395 coordinate the transcriptional regulatory pathway with PPARG2, which may be necessary for the genesis of adipocytes.

Abstract: Individual tumor cells utilize one of two modes of motility to invade the extracellular matrix, mesenchymal or amoeboid. We have determined that the diterpenoid genkwanine M (GENK) enhances the mesenchymal mode of cell motility that is intrinsic to HT-1080 osteosarcoma cells, stimulates a mesenchymal mode of motility in stationary MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cells, and induces a shift to a mesenchymal mode of cell motility in LS174T colorectal adenocarcinoma cells that normally utilize the alternate amoeboid mode of motility. The ability of GENK to stimulate or induce mesenchymal motility was preceded by a rapid cell spreading, elongation and polarization that did not require new gene expression. However, these initial morphologic changes were integrin dependent and they were associated with a reorganization of focal contacts and focal adhesions as well as an activation of the focal adhesion kinase. Therefore, GENK induces a mesenchymal mode of cell motility in a wide variety of tumor cell types that may be mediated, at least in part, by an activation of integrin-associated signaling.

Abstract: Autophagy is a cellular pathway involved in protein and organelle degradation. It is relevant to many types of cellular homeostasis and human diseases. High level of glucose is known to inflict podocyte injury, but little is reported about the relationship between high concentrations of glucose and autophagy in these cells. The present study demonstrates that high glucose promotes autophagy in podocytes. Rapamycin further enhances this effect, but 3-methyadenine inhibits it. The proautophagic effect of high glucose manifested in the form of enhanced podocyte expression of LC3-2 and beclin-1; interestingly, antioxidants such as NAC were found to inhibit high glucose-induced autophagy. High glucose induced the generation of ROS by podocytes in a time-dependent manner. High glucose also enhanced podocyte expression of MnSOD and catalase. These findings indicate that high glucose-induced autophagy is mediated through podocyte ROS generation.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are ‘protein misfolding disorders’ of the mature nervous system that are characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and selective cell loss. Different brain regions are impacted, with Alzheimer’s affecting cells in the cerebral cortex, Parkinson’s targeting dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra and ALS causing degeneration of cells in the spinal cord. These diseases differ widely in frequency in the human population. Alzheimer’s is more frequent than Parkinson’s and ALS. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are ‘protein repair agents’ that provide a line of defense against misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins. We have suggested that differing levels of constitutively expressed Hsps (Hsc70 and Hsp27) in neural cell populations confer a variable buffering capacity against ‘protein misfolding disorders’ that correlates with the relative frequencies of these neurodegenerative diseases. The high relative frequency of Alzheimer’s may due to low levels of Hsc70 and Hsp27 in affected cell populations that results in a reduced defense capacity against protein misfolding. Here, we demonstrate that celastrol, but not classical heat shock treatment, is effective in inducing a set of neuroprotective Hsps in cultures derived from cerebral cortices, including Hsp70, Hsp27 and Hsp32. This set of Hsps is induced by celastrol at ‘days in vitro’ (DIV) 13 when cultured cortical cells reached maturity. The inducibility of a set of neuroprotective Hsps in mature cortical cultures at DIV13 suggests that celastrol is a potential agent to counter Alzheimer’s disease, a neurodegenerative ‘protein misfolding disorder’ of the adult brain that targets cells in the cerebral cortex.

Abstract: The myosin heavy chain gene, MYHM86-2, exhibited restricted expression in slow muscle fibers of torafugu embryos and larvae, suggesting its functional roles for embryonic and larval muscle development. However, the transcriptional mechanisms involved in its expression are still ambiguous. The present study is the first extensive analysis of slow muscle-specific MYHM86-2 promoter in fish for identifying the cis-elements that are crucial for its expression. Combining both transient transfection and transgenic approaches, we demonstrated that the 2614bp 5′-flanking sequences of MYHM86-2 contain a sufficient promoter activity to drive gene expression specific to superficial slow muscle fibers. By cyclopamine treatment, we also demonstrated that the differentiation of such superficial slow muscle fibers depends on hedgehog signaling activity. The deletion analyses defined an upstream fragment necessary for repressing ectopic MYHM86-2 expression in the fast muscle fibers. The transcriptional mechanism that prevents MYHM86-2 expression in the fast muscle fibers is mediated through Sox6 binding elements. We also demonstrated that Sox6 may function as a transcriptional repressor of MYHM86-2 expression. We further discovered that nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding elements plays a key role and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) binding elements participate in the transcriptional regulation of MYHM86-2 expression.

Abstract: Efficient homing/mobilization of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to/from bone marrow niches enhances their therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, homing is dependent on cell source and may be modulated by prior ex vivo cell expansion. Here, we describe a novel application of a 3-dimensional time-lapse method for assessing trafficking of individual human cord blood CD133+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vitro, using the key chemokine CXCL12 as a paradigm. This new methodology allows distinction between chemotactic responses (displacement of center of mass and the forward migration index of the cells), and chemokinetic responses such as total cell path traveled in any direction (accumulated distance) and cell velocity in a 3-dimensional matrix. Other key advantages of this novel assay over existing assays include the ability to assess individual cell migration over times comparable to in vivo homing and rapid mobilization assays (18–24h) and to directly compare the strength or response of individual hematopoietic progenitor cells to different or competing stimuli and small molecule inhibitors in a single assay prior to analyses in vivo. Importantly, using this method, our results demonstrate definitively that CXCL12 regulates the chemotactic responses of human cord blood CD133+ cells, but not their random migration or chemokinesis.

Abstract: Summary
Stable microtubule (MT) subsets form distinct networks from dynamic MTs and acquire distinguishing posttranslational modifications, notably detyrosination and acetylation. Acting as specialized tracks for vesicle and macromolecular transport, their formation is regulated by the end-binding protein EB1, which recruits proteins that stabilize MTs. We show that HIV-1 induces the formation of acetylated and detyrosinated stable MTs early in infection. Although the MT depolymerizing agent nocodazole affected dynamic MTs, HIV-1 particles localized to nocodazole-resistant stable MTs, and infection was minimally affected. EB1 depletion or expression of an EB1 carboxy-terminal fragment that acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of MT stabilization prevented HIV-1-induced stable MT formation and suppressed early viral infection. Furthermore, we show that the HIV-1 matrix protein targets the EB1-binding protein Kif4 to induce MT stabilization. Our findings illustrate how specialized MT-binding proteins mediate MT stabilization by HIV-1 and the importance of stable MT subsets in viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Human complement is a first line defense against infection in which circulating proteins initiate an enzyme cascade on the microbial surface that leads to phagocytosis and lysis. Various pathogens evade complement recognition by binding to regulator proteins that protect host cells from complement activation. We show that emerging gametes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum bind the host complement regulator factor H (FH) following transmission to the mosquito to protect from complement-mediated lysis by the blood meal. Human complement is active in the mosquito midgut for approximately 1 hr postfeeding. During this period, the gamete surface protein PfGAP50 binds to FH and uses surface-bound FH to inactivate the complement protein C3b. Loss of FH-mediated protection, either through neutralization of FH or blockade of PfGAP50, significantly impairs gametogenesis and inhibits parasite transmission to the mosquito. Thus, Plasmodium co-opts the protective host protein FH to evade complement-mediated lysis within the mosquito midgut.

Abstract: Summary
Caspase-mediated inflammatory cell death acts as an intrinsic defense mechanism against infection. Bacterial pathogens deploy countermeasures against inflammatory cell death, but the mechanisms by which they do this remain largely unclear. In a screen for Shigella flexneri effectors that regulate cell death during infection, we discovered that Shigella infection induced acute inflammatory, caspase-4-dependent epithelial cell death, which is counteracted by the bacterial OspC3 effector. OspC3 interacts with the caspase-4-p19 subunit and inhibits its activation by preventing caspase-4-p19 and caspase-4-p10 heterodimerization by depositing the conserved OspC3 X1-Y-X2-D-X3 motif at the putative catalytic pocket of caspase-4. Infection of guinea pigs with a Shigella ospC3-deficient mutant resulted in enhanced inflammatory cell death and associated symptoms, correlating with decreased bacterial burdens. Salmonella Typhimurium and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection also induced caspase-4-dependent epithelial death. These findings highlight the importance of caspase-4-dependent innate immune responses and demonstrate that Shigella delivers a caspase-4-specific inhibitor to delay epithelial cell death and promote infection.

Abstract: Domino liver transplantation is a method used to increase the number of liver grafts available for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Reports indicate that livers from patients with metabolic liver disease can be safely transplanted into select recipients if the donor's defect and the recipient's metabolic needs are carefully considered. The liver of patients with many types of metabolic liver disease is morphologically and biochemically normal, except for the mutation that characterizes that disease. Other biochemical functions normally performed by the liver are present and presumably “normal” in these hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated from the liver of 35 organ donors and 35 liver tissues taken at OLT from patients with liver disease were analyzed for 9 different measures of viability and function. The data indicate that cells isolated from some diseased livers performed as well or better than those isolated from organ donors with respect to viability, cell yield, plating efficiency and in assays of liver function, including drug metabolism, conjugation reactions and ammonia metabolism. Cells from metabolic diseased livers rapidly and efficiently repopulated a mouse liver upon transplantation. Conclusions: As with domino liver transplantation, domino cell transplantation deserves consideration as method to extend the pool of available organs and cells for transplantation.

Abstract: We report transplanted hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) preferentially lodge within two cells of mature megakaryocytes (MM). With both populations comprising ~0.2% of bone marrow cells, this strongly suggests a key functional interaction. HSC isolated from the endosteum (eLSKSLAM) showed significantly increased hemopoietic cell proliferation while in co-culture with MM. Furthermore, eLSKSLAM progeny retained HSC potential, maintaining long-term multi-lineage reconstitution capacity in lethally ablated recipients. Increased hemopoietic cell proliferation was not MM contact dependent and could be recapitulated with media supplemented with two factors identified in MM-conditioned media: insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). We demonstrate that HSC express the receptor for IGF-1 and that IGF-1/IGFBP-3 induced increased hemopoietic cell proliferation can be blocked by an anti-IGF-1 neutralising antibody. However, co-cultures of 8N, 16N or 32N MM with eLSKSLAM showed that MM of individual ploidy did not significantly increase hemopoietic cell proliferation. Our data suggests that MM are an important component of the HSC niche and regulate hemopoietic cell proliferation through cytokine release.

Abstract: Summary
Several enveloped viruses exploit host pathways, such as the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, for their assembly and release. The influenza A virus (IAV) matrix protein binds to the ESCRT-I complex, although the involvement of early ESCRT proteins such as Tsg101 in IAV trafficking remain to be established. We find that Tsg101 can facilitate IAV trafficking, but this is effectively restricted by the interferon (IFN)-stimulated protein ISG15. Cytosol from type I IFN-treated cells abolished IAV hemagglutinin (HA) transport to the cell surface in infected semi-intact cells. This inhibition required Tsg101 and could be relieved with deISGylases. Tsg101 is itself ISGylated in IFN-treated cells. Upon infection, intact Tsg101-deficient cells obtained by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing were defective in the surface display of HA and for infectious virion release. These data support the IFN-induced generation of a Tsg101- and ISG15-dependent checkpoint in the secretory pathway that compromises influenza virus release.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into several distinct cell types, including osteoblasts and adipocytes. The balance between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation is disrupted in several osteogenic-related disorders, such as osteoporosis. So far, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that drive final lineage commitment of MSCs. In this study, we revealed that miR-17-5p and miR-106a have dual functions in the modulation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) commitment by gain- and loss-of-function assays. They could promote adipogenesis and inhibit osteogenesis. Luciferase reporter assay, western blot and ELISA suggested BMP2 was a direct target of miR-17-5p and miR-106a. Downregulation of endogeneous BMP2 by RNA interference suppressed osteogenesis and increased adipogenesis, similar to the effect of miR-17-5p and miR-106a upregulation. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of miR-17-5p on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs could be reversed by BMP2 RNA interference. In conclusion, miR-17-5p and miR-106a regulate osteogenic and adipogenic lineage commitment of hADSCs by directly targeting BMP2, and subsequently decreased osteogenic TAZ, MSX2 and Runx2, and increased adipogenic C/EBPα and PPARγ.

Abstract: Porcine mesenchymal stem cells (pMSCs) are an attractive source of cells for tissue engineering because their properties are similar to those of human stem cells. pMSCs can be found in different tissues but their dermal origin has not been studied in depth. Additionally, MSCs differentiation in monolayer cultures requires subcultured cells, and these cells are at risk of dedifferentiation when implanting them into living tissue. Following this, we attempted to characterize the MSCs phenotype of porcine dermal cells and to evaluate their cellular proliferation and differentiation in autologous fibrin scaffolds (AFSs). Dermal biopsies and blood samples were obtained from 12 pigs. Dermal cells were characterized by flow cytometry. Frozen autologous plasma was used to prepare AFSs. pMSC differentiation was studied in standard structures (monolayers and pellets) and in AFSs. The pMSCs expressed the CD90 and CD29 markers of the mesenchymal lineage. AFSs afforded adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. The porcine dermis can be proposed to be a good source of MSCs with adequate proliferative capacity and a suitable expression of markers. The pMSCs also showed optimal proliferation and differentiation in AFSs, such that these might serve as a promising autologous and implantable material for use in tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) constitute a promising resource for use in cell-based therapies and a valuable in vitro model for studying early human development and disease. Despite significant advancements in the derivation of specific fates from hPSCs, the generation of skeletal muscle remains challenging and is mostly dependent on transgene expression. Here, we describe a method based on the use of a small-molecule GSK3β inhibitor to derive skeletal muscle from several hPSC lines. We show that early GSK3β inhibition is sufficient to create the conditions necessary for highly effective derivation of muscle cells. Moreover, we developed a strategy for stringent fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based purification of emerging PAX3+/PAX7+ muscle precursors that are able to differentiate in postsort cultures into mature myocytes. This transgene-free, efficient protocol provides an essential tool for producing myogenic cells for in vivo preclinical studies, in vitro screenings, and disease modeling.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite current advances in therapy consisting of surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation, the overall survival rate still remains poor. Therapeutic failures are partly attributable to the highly infiltrative nature of tumor adjacent to normal brain parenchyma. Recently, evidence is mounting to suggest that actin cytoskeleton dynamics are critical components of the cell invasion process. Drebrin is an actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin filament organization, and plays a significant role in cell motility; however, the role of drebrin in glioma cell invasiveness has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study was aimed to clarify the role of drebrin in glioma cell morphology and cell motility. Here we show that drebrin is expressed in glioma cell lines and in operative specimens of GBM. We demonstrate that stable overexpression of drebrin in U87 cells leads to alterations in cell morphology, and induces increased invasiveness in vitro while knockdown of drebrin in U87 cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreases invasion and migration. In addition, we show that depletion of drebrin by siRNA alters glioma cell morphology in A172 GBM cell line. Our results suggest that drebrin contributes to the maintenance of cell shape, and may play an important role in glioma cell motility.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) shows attenuated expression in human coronary arteries as the extent of atherosclerosis progresses. In mice, overexpression of HSP27 reduces atherogenesis, yet the precise mechanism(s) are incompletely understood. Inflammation plays a central role in atherogenesis, and of particular interest is the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors produced by macrophages. As nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a key immune signaling modulator in atherogenesis, and macrophages are known to secrete HSP27, we sought to determine if recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27) alters NF-κB signaling in macrophages. Treatment of THP-1 macrophages with rHSP27 resulted in the degradation of an inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα, nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, and increased NF-κB transcriptional activity. Treatment of THP-1 macrophages with rHSP27 yielded increased expression of a variety of genes, including the pro-inflammatory factors, IL-1β, and TNF-α. However, rHSP27 also increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-10 and GM-CSF both at the mRNA and protein levels. Our study suggests that in macrophages, activation of NF-κB signaling by rHSP27 is associated with upregulated expression and secretion of key pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, we surmise that it is the balance in expression of these mediators and antagonists of inflammation, and hence atherogenesis, that yields a favorable net effect of HSP27 on the vessel wall.

Abstract: Salamanders have a remarkable capacity to regenerate complex tissues, such as limbs and brain, and are therefore an important comparative model system for regenerative medicine. Despite these unique properties among adult vertebrates, the genomic information for amphibians in general, and salamanders in particular, is scarce. Here, we used massive parallel sequencing to reconstruct a de novo reference transcriptome of the red spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) containing 118,893 transcripts with a N50 length of 2016nts. Comparisons to other vertebrates revealed a newt transcriptome that is comparable in size and characteristics to well-annotated vertebrate transcriptomes. Identification of putative open reading frames (ORFs) enabled us to infer a comprehensive proteome, including the annotation of 19,903 newt proteins. We used the identified domain architectures (DAs) to assign ORFs phylogenetic positions, which also revealed putative salamander specific proteins. The reference transcriptome and inferred proteome of the red spotted newt will facilitate the use of systematic genomic technologies for regeneration studies in salamanders and enable evolutionary analyses of vertebrate regeneration at the molecular level.

Requirement for protein kinase A in the phosphorylation of the TGFβ receptor-interacting protein km23-1 as a component of TGFβ downstream effects,

Abstract: km23-1 was previously identified as a TGFβ-receptor interacting protein that was phosphorylated on serines after TGFβ stimulation. In the current report, we examined the role of km23-1 phosphorylation in the downstream effects of TGFβ/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Using phosphorylation site prediction software, we found that km23-1 has two potential PKA consensus phosphorylation sites. In vitro kinase assays further demonstrated that PKA directly phosphorylates km23-1 on serine 73 (S73). Moreover, our results show that the PKA-specific inhibitor H89 diminishes phosphorylation of km23-1 on S73 after TGFβ stimulation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TGFβ induction of PKA activity results in phosphorylation of km23-1 on S73. In order to assess the mechanisms underlying PKA phosphorylation of km23-1 on S73 (S73-km23-1) after TGFβ stimulation, immunoprecipitation (IP)/blot analyses were performed, which demonstrate that TGFβ regulates complex formation between the PKA regulatory subunit RIβ and km23-1 in vivo. In addition, an S73A mutant of km23-1 (S73A-km23-1), which could not be phosphorylated by PKA, inhibited TGFβ induction of the km23-1-dynein complex and transcriptional activation of the activin-responsive element (ARE). Furthermore, our results show that km23-1 is required for cAMP-responsive element (CRE) transcriptional activation by TGFβ, with S73-km23-1 being required for the CRE-dependent TGFβ stimulation of fibronectin (FN) transcription. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that TGFβ/PKA phosphorylation of km23-1 on S73 is required for ARE- and CRE-mediated downstream events that include FN induction.

Abstract: Summary
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to human malignancies. The majority of tumor cells harbor latent virus, and a small percentage undergo spontaneous lytic replication. Both latency and lytic replication are important for viral pathogenesis and spread, but the cellular players involved in the switch between the two viral life-cycle phases are not clearly understood. We conducted a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen targeting the cellular kinome and identified Tousled-like kinases (TLKs) as cellular kinases that control KSHV reactivation from latency. Upon treatment of latent KSHV-infected cells with siRNAs targeting TLKs, we saw robust viral reactivation. Knockdown of TLKs in latent KSHV-infected cells induced expression of viral lytic proteins and production of infectious virus. TLKs were also found to play a role in regulating reactivation from latency of another related oncogenic gammaherpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus. Our results establish the TLKs as cellular repressors of gammaherpesvirus reactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic coupling of intracellular pathogens with host cells is essential for successful colonization of the host. Establishment of intracellular infection by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi leads to the development of human Chagas’ disease, yet the functional contributions of the host cell toward the infection process remain poorly characterized. Here, a genome-scale functional screen identified interconnected metabolic networks centered around host energy production, nucleotide metabolism, pteridine biosynthesis, and fatty acid oxidation as key processes that fuel intracellular T. cruzi growth. Additionally, the host kinase Akt, which plays essential roles in various cellular processes, was critical for parasite replication. Targeted perturbations in these host metabolic pathways or Akt-dependent signaling pathways modulated the parasite’s replicative capacity, highlighting the adaptability of this intracellular pathogen to changing conditions in the host. These findings identify key cellular process regulating intracellular T. cruzi growth and illuminate the potential to leverage host pathways to limit T. cruzi infection.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are hypersensitive to many DNA damaging agents and can rapidly undergo cell death or cell differentiation following exposure. Treatment of mouse ESCs (mESCs) with etoposide (ETO), a topoisomerase II poison, followed by a recovery period resulted in massive cell death with characteristics of a programmed cell death pathway (PCD). While cell death was both caspase- and necroptosis-independent, it was partially dependent on the activity of lysosomal proteases. A role for autophagy in the cell death process was eliminated, suggesting that ETO induces a novel PCD pathway in mESCs. Inhibition of p53 either as a transcription factor by pifithrin α or in its mitochondrial role by pifithrin μ significantly reduced ESC death levels. Finally, EndoG was newly identified as a protease participating in the DNA fragmentation observed during ETO-induced PCD. We coined the term charontosis after Charon, the ferryman of the dead in Greek mythology, to refer to the PCD signaling events induced by ETO in mESCs.

Abstract: Nuclear factor E2-related factor-1 (Nrf1) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is known to regulate antioxidant and cytoprotective gene expression. It was recently shown that Nrf1 is regulated by SCF–Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase. However our knowledge of upstream signals that targets Nrf1 for degradation by the UPS is not known. We report here that Nrf1 expression is negatively regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in Fbw7-dependent manner. We show that GSK3 interacts with Nrf1 and phosphorylates the Cdc4 phosphodegron domain (CPD) in Nrf1. Mutation of serine residue in the CPD of Nrf1 to alanine (S350A), blocks Nrf1 from phosphorylation by GSK3, and stabilizes Nrf1. Knockdown of Nrf1 and expression of a constitutively active form of GSK3 results in increased apoptosis in neuronal cells in response to ER stress, while expression of the GSK3 phosphorylation resistant S350A–Nrf1 attenuates apoptotic cell death. Together these data suggest that GSK3 regulates Nrf1 expression and cell survival function in response to stress activation.

Abstract: The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is required to maintain the activity of many signaling proteins, including members of the JAK/STAT and the PI3K pathways. Inhibitors of Hsp90 (Hsp90-Is) demonstrated varying activity against multiple myeloma (MM) in clinical trials. We aimed to determine which signaling pathways that account for the differential sensitivity to the Hsp90-I 17DMAG on a panel of MM cell lines and freshly obtained MM cells. Three CD45+ cell lines with an activated JAK/STAT3 pathway were sensitive to 17DMAG and underwent prominent apoptosis upon treatment, while the majority of CD45− cell lines, that were dependent on the activated PI3K pathway, were more resistant to the drug. Culturing the most resistant cell line, LP1, in the presence of IL-6 resulted in up-regulation of CD45 and pSTAT3, and sensitized to 17DMAG-induced apoptosis, primarily in the induced CD45+ sub-population of cells. The high CD45 expressers among primary myeloma cells also expressed significantly higher levels of pSTAT3, as compared to the low CD45 expressers. Ex vivo treatment of primary myeloma cells with 17DMAG resulted in a stronger caspase3 activation in tumor samples with the prevalence of high CD45 expressers. STAT3 activity was efficiently inhibited by Hsp90-Is in both cell lines and primary cells suggesting an importance of STAT3 inactivation for the pro-apoptotic effects of HSP90-Is. Indeed, over-expression of STAT3C, a variant with an increased DNA binding activity, in U266 cells protected them from 17DMAG-induced cell death. The down-regulation of the STAT3 target gene Mcl-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels following 17DMAG treatment was significantly attenuated in STAT3C-expressing cells, and transient over-expression of Mcl-1 protected U266 cells from 17DMAG-induced cell death. The finding that CD45+ MM cells with an IL-6-activated JAK/STAT3 pathway are particularly sensitive to Hsp90-Is as compared to the low CD45 expressers may provide a rational basis for selection of MM patients amenable to Hsp90-I treatment.

Abstract: The oncoprotein ErbB2 is endocytosis-deficient, probably due to its interaction with Heat shock protein 90. We previously demonstrated that clathrin-dependent endocytosis of ErbB2 is induced upon incubation of cells with Ansamycin derivatives, such as geldanamycin and its derivative 17-AAG. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that a preubiquitinated chimeric EGFR (EGFR-Ub4) is constitutively endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner. We now demonstrate that also an ErbB2-Ub4 chimera is endocytosed constitutively and clathrin-dependently. Upon expression, the ErbB2-Ub4 was further ubiquitinated, and by Western blotting, we demonstrated the formation of both Lys48-linked and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. ErbB2-Ub4 was constitutively internalized and eventually sorted to late endosomes and lysosomes where the fusion protein was degraded. ErbB2-Ub4 was not cleaved prior to internalization. Interestingly, over-expression of Ubiquitin Interaction Motif-containing dominant negative fragments of the clathrin adaptor proteins epsin1 and Eps15 negatively affected endocytosis of ErbB2. Altogether, this argues that ubiquitination is sufficient to induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the otherwise plasma membrane localized ErbB2. Also, it appears that C-terminal cleavage is not required for endocytosis.

Abstract: The subventricular zone (SVZ) is recognized as one of the neurogenic regions in the adult mammalian central nervous system and the presence of cells that share similar characteristics with developmental radial glia, the radial glia-like cells (RGLCs) has been demonstrated in this region. In this study, we investigated whether and how SVZ cells respond to global ischemia and/or to the intravenous transplant of bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs). Adult rats were subjected to bilateral common carotid ligation (BCCL) and after 1day 2×107 BMMCs or saline injection. The BMMC transplant stimulated a transitory increase in the proliferation of SVZ cells in the BCCL group. We observed a significant increase in the number of RGLCs 3days after ischemia, in both BCCL and BCCL+BMMC groups. However, this increase persisted in the subsequent days only in BCCL animals that received the transplant. BMMC transplantation also inhibits the reduction of NG2-positive oligodendrocyte progenitors in the SVZ observed in the BCCL group. Interestingly, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was up-regulated in the SVZ in the treated animals, but not in the other groups. These data thus suggest that BMMC transplantation modulates the phenotype of RGLCs/progenitors in the SVZ and could have a protective role after ischemia.

Abstract: Muscle spindles are sensory receptors embedded within muscle that detect changes in muscle length. Each spindle is composed of specialized muscle fibers, known as intrafusal muscle fibers, along with the endings of axons from sensory neurons that innervate these muscle fibers. Formation of muscle spindles requires neuregulin1 (NRG1), which is released by sensory axons, activating ErbB receptors in muscle cells that are contacted. In muscle cells, the transcription factor Egr3 is transcriptionally induced by NRG1, which in turn activates various target genes involved in forming the intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles. The signaling relay within the NRG1–ErbB pathway that acts to induce Egr3 is presumably critical for muscle spindle formation but for the most part has not been determined. In the current studies, we examined, using cultured muscle cells, transcriptional regulatory mechanisms by which Egr3 responds to NRG1. We identified a composite regulatory element for the Egr3 gene, consisting adjacent sites that bind cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and serum response factor (SRF), with a role in NRG1 responsiveness. The SRF element also influences Egr3 basal expression in unstimulated myotubes, and in the absence of the SRF element, the CREB element influences basal expression. We show that NRG1 signaling, to target SRF, acts on the SRF coactivators myocardian-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A and MRTF-B, which are known to activate SRF-mediated transcription, by stimulating their translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. CREB is phosphorylated, which is known to contribute to its activation, in response to NRG1. These results suggest that NRG1 induces expression of the muscle spindle-specific gene Egr3 by stimulating the transcriptional activity of CREB and SRF.

Abstract: The effectiveness of vandetanib, an agent that targets RET, VEGFR and EGFR signaling, against EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells with PTEN loss was investigated. Two EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, PC-9 (PTEN wild type) and NCI-H1650 (PTEN null), were used. We transfected an intact PTEN gene into H1650 cells and knocked down PTEN expression in PC-9 cells using shRNA. The effectiveness of gefitinib and vandetanib was assessed using a xenograft model. While PC-9 cells were more resistant to vandetanib than gefitinib, H1650 cells were more sensitive to vandetanib than gefitinib. Both gefitinib and vandetanib suppressed the activation of EGFR and MAPK in H1650 cells, although phosphorylated AKT levels were not affected. In an H1650 cell xenograft model, vandetanib was also more effective than gefitinib. Although PTEN-transfected H1650 cells did not show restoration of sensitivity to gefitinib in vitro, the xenograft tumors responded to gefitinib and vandetanib. Knockdown of PTEN in PC-9 cells caused resistance to gefitinib. In conclusion, vandetanib might be effective in NSCLC with EGFR mutations that lack PTEN expression. The contribution of PTEN absence to vandetanib activity in NSCLC cells harboring EGFR mutations should be further examined.

Abstract: Besides representing the sarcomeric thick filaments, myosins are involved in many cellular transport and motility processes. Myosin heavy chains are grouped into 18 classes. Here we show that in Drosophila, the unconventional group XVIII myosin heavy chain-like (Mhcl) is transcribed in the mesoderm of embryos, most prominently in founder cells (FCs). An ectopically expressed GFP-tagged Mhcl localizes in the growing muscle at cell–cell contacts towards the attached fusion competent myoblast (FCM). We further show that Mhcl interacts in vitro with the essential fusion protein Rolling pebbles 7 (Rols7), which is part of a protein complex established at cell contact sites (Fusion-restricted Myogenic-Adhesive Structure or FuRMAS). Here, branched F-actin is likely needed to widen the fusion pore and to integrate the myoblast into the growing muscle. We show that the localization of Mhcl is dependent on the presence of Rols7, and we postulate that Mhcl acts at the FuRMAS as an actin motor protein. We further show that Mhcl deficient embryos develop a wild-type musculature. We thus propose that Mhcl functions redundantly to other myosin heavy chains in myoblasts. Lastly, we found that the protein is detectable adjacent to the sarcomeric Z-discs, suggesting an additional function in mature muscles.

Abstract: Cell replacement is an emerging therapy for type 1 diabetes. Pluripotent stem cells have received a lot of attention as a potential source of transplantable β-cells, but their ability to form teratomas poses significant risks. Here, we evaluated the potential of primary mouse gall bladder epithelial cells (GBCs) as targets for ex vivo genetic reprogramming to the β-cell fate. Conditions for robust expansion and genetic transduction of primary GBCs by adenoviral vectors were developed. Using a GFP reporter for insulin, conditions for reprogramming were then optimized. Global expression analysis by RNA-sequencing was used to quantitatively compare reprogrammed GBCs (rGBCs) to true β-cells, revealing both similarities and differences. Adenoviral-mediated expression of NEUROG3, Pdx1, and MafA in GBCs resulted in robust induction of pancreatic endocrine genes, including Ins1, Ins2, Neurod1, Nkx2-2 and Isl1. Furthermore, expression of GBC-specific genes was repressed, including Sox17 and Hes1. Reprogramming was also enhanced by addition of retinoic acid and inhibition of Notch signaling. Importantly, rGBCs were able to engraft long term in vivo and remained insulin-positive for 15weeks. We conclude that GBCs are a viable source for autologous cell replacement in diabetes, but that complete reprogramming will require further manipulations.

Abstract: Summary
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in humans. While the importance of natural killer (NK) cells in innate immune protection against tumors and viral infections is well documented, their role in defense against bacterial infections is still emerging, and their involvement in UPEC-mediated UTI is practically unknown. Using a systematic mutagenesis approach, we found that UPEC adheres to NK cells primarily via its type I fimbriae and employs its hemolysinA toxin to kill NK cells. In the absence of hemolysinA, NK cells directly respond to the bacteria and secrete the cytokine TNF-α, which results in decreased bacterial numbers in vitro and reduction of bacterial burden in the infected bladders. Thus, NK cells control UPEC via TNF-α production, which UPEC counteracts by hemolysinA-mediated killing of NK cells, representing a previously unrecognized host defense and microbial counterattack mechanism in the context of UTI.

Abstract: E2F1 is implicated in transcriptional activation of polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1), but yet the mechanism is not fully understood. PLK1 suppression plays an important checkpoint role in response to DNA damage. Suppression of the PLK1 gene by binding of p53 to upstream p53RE2 element in the promoter has been recently revealed. Here we report another mechanism, in which p53 interacts with E2F1 to form p53–E2F1–DNA complex repressing E2F1-dependent PLK1 expression. PLK1 was downregulated in cisplatin exposed HCT116p53+/+ but not HCT116p53−/− cells, indicating p53-suppressed PLK1 upon DNA damage. Co-transfection and reporter enzyme assays revealed that p53 suppressed but E2F1 promoted PLK1 gene activation. 5'-Deletion and substitution mutations showed multiple positive cis-elements residing in the PLK1 promoter, of which at least two E2F1 sites at positions −75/−68 and −40/−32 were required for the full activity of the promoter. Combination of 5'-deletion and substitution mutations with over-expression of p53 showed that suppression of the PLK1 gene by p53 was E2F1-dependent: mutation of the E2F1 site at position −75/−68 partially abrogated suppression activity of p53; mutation of E2F1 site at position −40/−32 released from p53 suppression of PLK1 gene completely. Co-immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that DNA damage promoted p53–E2F1 interaction, thereby creating a p53–E2F1 complex assembly on the PLK1 promoter in vitro. The in vivo formation of p53–E2F1–PLK1 promoter complex upon DNA damage was further evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP. In addition, we showed that suppression of PLK1 by p53 promoted apoptosis. Our data suggest that p53 may interact with E2F1 to form p53–E2F1–DNA complex suppressing E2F1-dependent PLK1 expression. The model of p53 action on E2F1-activated PLK1 gene may explain at least partly how p53 as a suppressor regulates the downstream effects of E2F1 in cellular stresses including DNA damage stress.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of NF-κB-dependent responses is critical to the success of attaching/effacing (A/E) human pathogenic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC) and the natural mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. NleB, a highly conserved type III secretion system effector of A/E pathogens, suppresses NF-κB activation, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We identified the mammalian glycolysis enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an NleB-interacting protein. Further, we discovered that GAPDH interacts with the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), a protein required for TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation, and regulates TRAF2 polyubiquitination. During infection, NleB functions as a translocated N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase that modifies GAPDH. NleB-mediated GAPDH O-GlcNAcylation disrupts the TRAF2-GAPDH interaction to suppress TRAF2 polyubiquitination and NF-κB activation. Eliminating NleB O-GlcNAcylation activity attenuates C. rodentium colonization of mice. These data identify GAPDH as a TRAF2 signaling cofactor and reveal a virulence strategy employed by A/E pathogens to inhibit NF-κB-dependent host innate immune responses.

Abstract: The presence of the EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), EndMT (endothelial-mesenchymal transition) and VM (vasculogenic mimicry) demonstrates the multidirectional extent of phenotypic plasticity in cancers. Previous findings demonstrating the crosstalk between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) imply that HNSCC cells share some functional commonalities with endothelial cells. Our current results reveal that cultured HNSCC cells not only possess endothelial-specific markers, but also display endotheliod functional features including low density lipoprotein uptake, formation of tube-like structures on Matrigel and growth state responsiveness to VEGF and endostatin. HNSCC cell subpopulations are also highly responsive to transforming growth factor-β1 and express its auxiliary receptor, endoglin. Furthermore, the endotheliod characteristics observed in vitro recapitulate phenotypic features observed in human HNSCC tumors. Conversely, cultured normal human oral keratinocytes and intact or ulcerated human oral epithelia do not express comparable endotheliod characteristics, which imply that assumption of endotheliod features is restricted to transformed keratinocytes. In addition, this phenotypic state reciprocity facilitates HNSCC progression by increasing production of factors that are concurrently pro-proliferative and pro-angiogenic, conserving cell energy stores by LDL internalization and enhancing cell mobility. Finally, recognition of this endotheliod phenotypic transition provides a solid rationale to evaluate the antitumorigenic potential of therapeutic agents formerly regarded as exclusively angiostatic in scope.

In the present study, we observed specific, high level expression of HspB1 protein and an HspB1 gene reporter in developing craniofacial muscles of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, and examined the consequences of reducing HspB1 expression to the development and growth of these muscles. Quantitative morphometric analyses revealed a reduction in the cross-sectional area of myofibers in embryos expressing reduced HspB1 levels by as much as 47% compared to controls. In contrast, we detected no differences in the number of myofibrils or associated nuclei, nor the number, size or development of chondrocytes in surrounding tissues. We also did not detect changes to the overall organization of sarcomeres or myofibrils in embryos expressing reduced levels of HspB1. Together our results reveal a critical role for HspB1 in the growth of myofibrils and provide new insight into the mechanism underlying its developmental function.

Abstract: Water-soluble protein signals (pheromones) of the ciliate Euplotes have been supposed to be functional precursors of growth factors and cytokines that regulate cell–cell interaction in multi-cellular eukaryotes. This work provides evidence that native preparations of the Euplotes raikovi pheromone Er-1 (a helical protein of 40 amino acids) specifically increases viability, DNA synthesis, proliferation, and the production of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, and IL-13 in human Jurkat T-cells. Also, Er-1 significantly decreases the mRNA levels of the β and γ subunits of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), while the mRNA levels of the α subunit appeared to be not affected. Jurkat T-cell treatments with Er-1 induced the down-regulation of the IL-2Rα subunit by a reversible and time-dependent endocytosis, and increased the levels of phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). The cell-type specificity of these effects was supported by the finding that Er-1, although unable to directly influence the growth of human glioma U-373 cells, induced Jurkat cells to synthesize and release factors that, in turn, inhibited the U-373 cell proliferation. Overall, these findings imply that Er-1 coupling to IL-2R and ERK immuno-enhances T-cell activity, and that this effect likely translates to an inhibition of glioma cell growth.

Abstract: A short G1 phase is a characteristic feature of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). To determine if there is a causal relationship between G1 phase restriction and pluripotency, we made use of the Fluorescence Ubiquitination Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) reporter system to FACS-sort ESCs in the different cell cycle phases. Hence, the G1 phase cells appeared to be more susceptible to differentiation, particularly when ESCs self-renewed in the naïve state of pluripotency. Transitions from ground to naïve, then from naïve to primed states of pluripotency were associated with increased durations of the G1 phase, and cyclin E-mediated alteration of the G1/S transition altered the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. LIF withdrawal resulted in a lengthening of the G1 phase in naïve ESCs, which occurred prior to the appearance of early lineage-specific markers, and could be reversed upon LIF supplementation. We concluded that the short G1 phase observed in murine ESCs was a determinant of naïve pluripotency and was partially under the control of LIF signaling.

Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a regulatory-approved modality for treating a variety of malignant tumors. It induces tumor tissue damage via photosensitizer-mediated oxidative cytotoxicity. The heat shock protein 70 (HSP70-1) is a stress protein encoded by the HSPA1A gene and is significantly induced by oxidative stress associated with PDT. The aim of this study was to identify the functional region of the HSPA1A promoter that responds to PDT-induced oxidative stress and uses the stress responsiveness of HSPA1A expression to establish a rapid and cost-effective photocytotoxic assessment bioassay to evaluate the photodynamic potential of photosensitizers. By constructing luciferase vectors with a variety of hspa1a promoter fractions and examining their relative luciferase activity, we demonstrated that the DNA sequence from −218 to +87 of the HSPA1A gene could be used as a functional promoter to detect the PDT-induced oxidative stress. The maximal relative luciferase activity level of HSPA1A (HSP70-1) induced by hypericin-PDT was nearly nine times that of the control. Our results suggest that the novel reporter gene assay using a functional region of the HSP70A1A promoter has significant advantages for the detection of photoactivity in terms of both speed and sensitivity, when compared with a cell viability test based on ATP quantification and ROS levels. Furthermore, phthalocyanine zinc and methylene blue both induced significantly elevated levels of relative luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner.

Abstract: In this study, we used a multiple copy (EGFP)3 reporter system to establish a numeric nuclear index system to assess the degree of nuclear import. The system was first validated by a FRAP assay, and then was applied to evaluate the essential and multifaceted nature of basic amino acid clusters during the nuclear import of ribosomal protein L7. The results indicate that the sequence context of the basic cluster determines the degree of nuclear import, and that the number of basic residues in the cluster is irrelevant; rather the position of the pertinent basic residues is crucial. Moreover, it also found that the type of carrier protein used by basic cluster has a great impact on the degree of nuclear import. In case of L7, importin β2 or importin β3 are preferentially used by clusters with a high import efficiency, notwithstanding that other importins are also used by clusters with a weaker level of nuclear import. Such a preferential usage of multiple basic clusters and importins to gain nuclear entry would seem to be a common practice among ribosomal proteins in order to ensure their full participation in high rate ribosome synthesis.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor, which, despite combined modality treatment, reoccurs and is invariably fatal for affected patients. Recently, a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase D (PRKD) family, PRKD2, was shown to be a potent mediator of glioblastoma growth. Here we studied the role of PRKD2 in U87MG glioblastoma cell migration and invasion in response to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an activator of PRKD2 and a GBM mitogen. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that random cell migration was significantly diminished in response to PRKD2 silencing. The pharmacological PRKD family inhibitor CRT0066101 decreased chemotactic migration and invasion across uncoated or matrigel-coated Transwell inserts. Silencing of PRKD2 attenuated migration and invasion of U87MG cells even more effectively. In terms of downstream signaling, CRT0066101 prevented PRKD2 autophosphorylation and inhibited p44/42 MAPK and to a smaller extent p54/46 JNK and p38 MAPK activation. PRKD2 silencing impaired activation of p44/42 MAPK and p54/46 JNK, downregulated nuclear c-Jun protein levels and decreased c-JunS73 phosphorylation without affecting the NFκB pathway. Finally, qPCR array analyses revealed that silencing of PRKD2 downregulates mRNA levels of integrin alpha-2 and -4 (ITGA2 and -4), plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU), plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (PLAUR), and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1). Findings of the present study identify PRKD2 as a potential target to interfere with glioblastoma cell migration and invasion, two major determinants contributing to recurrence of glioblastoma after multimodality treatment.

Abstract: Extraocular muscles are a unique subset of striated muscles. During postnatal development, the extraocular muscles undergo a number of myosin isoform transitions that occur between postnatal day P10 (P10) and P15. These include: (1) loss of embryonic myosin from the global layer resulting in the expression restricted to the orbital layer; (2) the onset of expression of extraocular myosin and the putative tonic myosin (myh 7b/14); and (3) the redistribution of nonmuscle myosin IIB from a subsarcolemmal position to a sarcomeric distribution in the slow fibers of the global layer. For this study, we examined the postnatal appearance and distribution of α-actinin, tropomyosin, and nebulin isoforms during postnatal development of the rat extraocular muscles. Although sarcomeric α-actinin is detectable from birth, α-actinin 3 appears around P15. Both tropomyosin-1 and -2 are present from birth in the same distribution as in the adult animal. The expression of nebulin was monitored by gel electrophoresis and western blots. At P5-10, nebulin exhibits a lower molecular mass than observed P15 and later during postnatal development. The changes in α-actinin 3 and nebulin expression between P10 and P15 coincide with transitions in myosin isoforms as detailed above. These data point to P10–P15 as the critical period for the maturation of the extraocular muscles, coinciding with eyelid opening.

Abstract: Dupuytren’s contracture (DC) is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiology characterized by a scar-like contracture that develops in the palm and/or digits. We have previously reported that the eta subunit of the chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide (CCT-eta) is increased in fibrotic wound healing, and is essential for the accumulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in fibroblasts. The purpose of this study was to determine if CCT-eta is similarly implicated in the aberrant fibrosis seen in DC and to investigate the role of CCT-eta in the behavior of myo/fibroblasts in DC. Fibroblasts were obtained from DC-affected palmar fascia, from adjacent phenotypically normal palmar fascia in the same DC patients (PF), and from non-DC palmar fascial tissues in patients undergoing carpal tunnel (CT) release. Inherent contractility in these three populations was examined using fibroblast-populated collagen lattices (FPCLs) and by cell traction force microscopy. Expression of CCT-eta and α-SMA protein was determined by Western blot. The effect of CCT-eta inhibition on the contractility of DC cells was determined by deploying an siRNA versus CCT-eta. DC cells were significantly more contractile than both matching palmar fascial (PF) cells and CT cells in both assays, with PF cells demonstrating an intermediate contractility in the FPCL assay. Whereas α-SMA protein was significantly increased only in DC cells compared to PF and CT cells, CCT-eta protein was significantly increased in both PF and DC cells compared to CT cells. siRNA-mediated depletion of CCT-eta inhibited the accumulation of both CCT-eta and α-SMA protein in DC cells, and also significantly decreased the contractility of treated DC cells. These observations suggest that increased expression of CCT-eta appears to be a marker for latent and active disease in these patients and to be essential for the increased contractility exhibited by these fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
OsCEBiP, a chitin-binding protein, and OsCERK1, a receptor-like kinase, are plasma membrane (PM) proteins that form a receptor complex essential for fungal chitin-driven immune responses in rice. The signaling events immediately following chitin perception are unclear. Investigating the spatiotemporal regulation of the rice small GTPase OsRac1, we find that chitin induces rapid activation of OsRac1 at the PM. Searching for OsRac1 interactors, we identified OsRacGEF1 as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for OsRac1. OsRacGEF1 interacts with OsCERK1 and is activated when its C-terminal S549 is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic domain of OsCERK1 in response to chitin. Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection. Further, a protein complex including OsCERK1 and OsRacGEF1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a “defensome” critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity.

Abstract: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is used for a number of applications, including the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and CO poisoning. However, we and others have shown that HBOT can mobilize cellular antioxidant defenses, suggesting that it may also be useful under circumstances in which tissue protection from oxidative damage is desired. To test the protective properties of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on a tissue level, we evaluated the ability of a preconditioning treatment regimen to protect cutaneous tissue from UV-A-induced oxidative damage. Three groups of hairless SKH1-E mice were exposed to UV-A 3 days per week for 22 weeks, with two of these groups receiving an HBO pretreatment either two or four times per week. UV-A exposure increased apoptosis and proliferation of the skin tissue, indicating elevated levels of epithelial damage and repair. Pretreatment with HBO significantly reduced UV-A-induced apoptosis and proliferation. A morphometric analysis of microscopic tissue folds also showed a significant increase in skin creasing following UV-A exposure, which was prevented by HBO pretreatment. Likewise, skin elasticity was found to be greatest in the group treated with HBO four times per week. The effects of HBO were also apparent systemically as reductions in caspase-3 activity and expression were observed in the liver. Our findings support a protective function of HBO pretreatment from a direct oxidative challenge of UV-A to skin tissue. Similar protection of other tissues may likewise be achievable.

Abstract: We investigated the role of canonical WNT signaling in mesoderm and hematopoietic development from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using a recombinant human protein-based differentiation medium (APEL). In contrast to prior studies using less defined culture conditions, we found that WNT3A alone was a poor inducer of mesoderm. However, WNT3A synergized with BMP4 to accelerate mesoderm formation, increase embryoid body size, and increase the number of hematopoietic blast colonies. Interestingly, inclusion of WNT3A or a GSK3 inhibitor in methylcellulose colony-forming assays at 4 days of differentiation abrogated blast colony formation but supported the generation of mesospheres that expressed genes associated with mesenchymal lineages. Mesospheres differentiated into cells with characteristics of bone, fat, and smooth muscle. These studies identify distinct effects for WNT3A, supporting the formation of hematopoietic or mesenchymal lineages from human embryonic stem cells, depending upon differentiation stage at the time of exposure.

Abstract: Identification of differentially expressed genes in angioblasts derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is of great interest for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying human vasculogenesis. The aim of this study was to define hESC-derived angioblasts at the clonal level and to perform comparative transcriptional analysis to characterize their distinct gene expression profiles. In a clonal analysis performed in cell-specific differentiation media, hESC-derived CD34+CD31+ cells were identified as angioblasts in that they exhibited a significantly higher ability to form endothelial cell (EC) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) colonies than CD34+CD31− and CD34− cell populations did. Microarray analysis showed that many genes involved in vascular development and signaling transduction were overexpressed in hESC-derived CD34+CD31+ cells, whereas those related to mitosis, the DNA damage response, and translation were substantially downregulated. In addition, comparative gene expression profiling of hESC-derived CD34+CD31+ cells and human somatic primary vascular cells demonstrated that hESC-derived CD34+CD31+ cells expressed key genes involved in the EC and SMC differentiation processes, which supports the result that hESC-derived CD34+CD31+ cells are bipotent angioblasts. Our results may provide insights into the identity and function of hESC-derived angioblasts and may also facilitate further investigation of the molecular mechanisms regulating human embryonic vasculogenesis.

Abstract: Recent evidence has shown that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) may exhibit immuno-suppression activities through soluble mediators and direct cell–cell contact, but how these processes are modulated has been poorly understood. In this study, we show that the Notch signaling pathway participates in the modulation of BMSCs to elicit their immuno-suppressive roles. In a murine lethal acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) model, BMSCs deficient for RBP-J, the critical transcription factor mediating signaling from all four mammalian Notch receptors, failed to delay the development of the disease. RBP-J deficient BMSCs were not able to inhibit the proliferation and activation of allogenic T-cells. Moreover, RBP-J deficient BMSCs could not down-regulate the expression of MHC II and co-stimulation molecules CD80 and CD86 on dendritic cells (DCs). The antigen presentation capacity of DCs co-cultured with RBP-J deficient BMSCs was not impaired in contrast to wild type BMSCs. Furthermore, we showed that the productions of IL-6 and PGE2, two critical molecules mediating the immuno-suppressive activities of BMSCs, were reduced significantly in RBP-J deficient BMSCs. Both of the two molecules were importantly involved in the regulation of BMSCs by Notch signaling. In conclusion, our data suggests that the immuno-suppressive effects of BMSCs in aGvHD are dependent on Notch-RBP-J signaling, which regulates the productions of IL-6 and PGE2.

Abstract: Summary
Following intracellular replication, the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii cause host cell cytolysis to facilitate parasite release and disease progression. Parasite exit from infected cells requires the interplay of parasite-derived proteins and host actin cytoskeletal changes; however, the host proteins underlying these changes remain obscure. We report the identification of a Gαq-coupled host-signaling cascade required for the egress of both P. falciparum and T. gondii. Gαq-coupled signaling results in protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated loss of the host cytoskeletal protein adducin and weakening of the cellular cytoskeleton. This cytoskeletal compromise induces catastrophic Ca2+ influx mediated by the mechanosensitive cation channel TRPC6, which activates host calpain that proteolyzes the host cytoskeleton allowing parasite release. Reinforcing the feasibility of targeting host proteins as an antiparasitic strategy, mammalian PKC inhibitors demonstrated activity in murine models of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Importantly, an orally bioavailable PKC inhibitor prolonged survival in an experimental cerebral malaria model.

Keratin 8/18 regulation of glucose metabolism in normal versus cancerous hepatic cells through differential modulation of hexokinase status and insulin signaling,

Abstract: As differentiated cells, hepatocytes primarily metabolize glucose for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation of glycolytic pyruvate, whereas proliferative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells undergo a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis despite oxygen availability. Keratins, the intermediate filament (IF) proteins of epithelial cells, are expressed as pairs in a lineage/differentiation manner. Hepatocyte and HCC (hepatoma) cell IFs are made solely of keratins 8/18 (K8/K18), thus providing models of choice to address K8/K18 IF functions in normal and cancerous epithelial cells. Here, we demonstrate distinctive increases in glucose uptake, glucose-6-phosphate formation, lactate release, and glycogen formation in K8/K18 IF-lacking hepatocytes and/or hepatoma cells versus their respective IF-containing counterparts. We also show that the K8/K18-dependent glucose uptake/G6P formation is linked to alterations in hexokinase I/II/IV content and localization at mitochondria, with little effect on GLUT1 status. In addition, we find that the insulin-stimulated glycogen formation in normal hepatocytes involves the main PI-3 kinase-dependent signaling pathway and that the K8/K18 IF loss makes them more efficient glycogen producers. In comparison, the higher insulin-dependent glycogen formation in K8/K18 IF-lacking hepatoma cells is associated with a signaling occurring through a mTOR-dependent pathway, along with an augmentation in cell proliferative activity. Together, the results uncover a key K8/K18 regulation of glucose metabolism in normal and cancerous hepatic cells through differential modulations of mitochondrial HK status and insulin-mediated signaling.

Abstract: Mammals have 10 RASSF proteins, which are characterized by the Ras-association (RA) domain. Among them, RASSF1 to RASSF6 have the Salvador/RASSF/Hippo (SARAH) domain and form the subclass C-terminal RASSF proteins. Drosophila genome has a single C-terminal RASSF, dRASSF. All these RASSF proteins are related to the tumor suppressive Hippo pathway, and are considered to function as tumor suppressors. Caenorhabditis elegans T24F1.3 encodes a protein with the RA and the SARAH domains. The amino acid sequences are 40% and 55% similar to those of RASSF1 in the RA and the SARAH domains, respectively. We have characterized T24F1.3 gene product and named it RSF-1 as RASSF1 homolog. RSF-1 is widely expressed in epithelial cells. About 14% rsf-1 mutants exhibit defects in embryonal morphogenesis and the actin disorganization. The combinatorial synthetic lethal analysis demonstrates that the lethality is enhanced to more than 80% in rsf-1 mutants with the WASP-family verprolin homologous protein complex-related gene depletions and corroborates the implication of RSF-1 in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. In rsf-1 mutants, the structures of muscle actin are preserved, but the swimming ability is impaired. Although we could not detect the direct physical interaction of LET-60 with RSF-1, rsf-1 mutants suppress the multivulva phenotype of the active let-60 mutants, suggesting that rsf-1 genetically interacts with the Ras signaling.

Abstract: Withaferin A (WFA) is a major chemical constituent of Withania somnifera, also known as Indian ginseng. Many recent reports have provided evidence of its anti-tumor, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant, and immune modulatory activities. Although the compound appears to have a large number of effects, its defined mechanisms of action have not yet been determined. We investigated the effects of WFA on loss of type collagen expression and inflammation in rabbit articular chondrocytes. WFA increased the production of reactive oxygen species, suggesting the induction of oxidative stress, in a dose-dependent manner. Also, we confirmed that WFA causes loss of type collagen expression and inflammation as determined by a decrease of type II collagen expression and an increase of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression via western blot analysis in a dose- and time- dependent manner. WFA also reduced the synthesis of sulfated proteoglycan via Alcian blue staining and caused the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) via assay kit in dose- and time-dependent manners. Treatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, inhibited WFA-induced loss of type II collagen expression and increase in COX-2 expression, accompanied by inhibition of reactive oxygen species production. WFA increased phosphorylation of both Akt and p38. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt, p38, and JNK with LY294002 (LY), SB203580 (SB), or SP600125 (SP) in WFA-treated cells rescued the expression of type II collagen and suppressed the expression of COX-2. These results demonstrate that WFA induces loss of type collagen expression and inflammation via PI3K/Akt, p38, and JNK by generating reactive oxygen species in rabbit articular chondrocytes.

Abstract: Administration of fibroblastic cells derived from a number of tissues (collectively called “mesenchymal stem cells”) has been suggested to be beneficial for renal repair and mortality reduction in renal ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI), but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In the present study, our objective was to investigate the involvement of macrophages in the therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord-derived stromal cells (hUCSCs) on renal IRI. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, hUCSCs were injected intravenously and resulted in significant improvements in renal function, with a lower tubular injury score together with more proliferative and fewer apoptotic tubular cells in kidney tissue. Moreover, hUCSCs reduced the infiltration of macrophages into renal interstitium especially at 5days post-reperfusion, while the proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages was markedly increased. HUCSCs also alleviated the local inflammatory response in kidneys. The absence of macrophages during the early phase of reperfusion enhanced the therapeutic effect of hUCSCs, whereas macrophage depletion during the late repair phase eliminated the renoprotective role of hUCSCs. In vitro, macrophages cocultured with hUCSCs were switched to the alternatively activated M2 phenotype. Our data indicate that hUCSCs are capable of promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages at injury sites, suggesting a new mechanism for hUCSC-mediated protection in renal IRI.

Abstract: The presence of serum in cell culture medium presents an obstacle to safe and efficient production of hMSCs for therapeutic purposes. Availability of defined medium will be crucial to elucidating the mechanism of action of hMSCs in many indications as well as a prerequisite to consistently produce cells with predictable performance characteristics. Using a bioinformatics driven approach, which we call the BD Discovery Platform, we have developed a novel serum-free medium that supports highly efficient growth while maintaining the surface markers and functional characteristics defining hMSCs. In a comparison with serum-containing and other commercially available serum-free formulations, all conditions led to expansion of cells that meet the minimal criteria for hMSCs as set by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT). However, differences in growth characteristics and gene expression patterns suggest that expansion in serum-free growth conditions can provide greater yields in a shorter time. The mRNA expression profile observed in cells grown without serum suggests upregulation of several genes implicated in hMSC function as well as downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL6.

Abstract: Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC) respond to injury after brain injuries secreting IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10, as well as chemokine members of the CC and CXC ligand families. CXCL12 is one of the chemokines secreted at an injury site and is known to attract NSC-derived neuroblasts, cells that express CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4. Activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 depends on two domains located at the N-terminal of the chemokine. In the present work we aimed to investigate if the N-terminal end of CXCL12, where CXCR4 binding and activation domains are located, was sufficient to induce NSC-derived neuroblast chemotaxis. Our data show that a synthetic peptide analogous to the first 21 amino acids of the N-terminal end of CXCL12, named PepC-C (KPVSLSYRCPCRFFESHIARA), is able to promote chemotaxis of neuroblasts in vivo, and stimulate chemotaxis and proliferation of CXCR4+ cells in vitro, without affecting NSC fate. We also show that PepC-C upregulates CXCL12 expression in vivo and in vitro. We suggest the N-terminal end of CXCL12 is responsible for a positive feedback loop to maintain a gradient of CXCL12 that attracts neuroblasts from the subventricular zone into an injury site.

Abstract: Summary
Humans and mice infected with different Plasmodium strains are known to produce microvesicles derived from the infected red blood cells (RBCs), denoted RMVs. Studies in mice have shown that RMVs are elevated during infection and have proinflammatory activity. Here we present a detailed characterization of RMV composition and function in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Proteomics profiling revealed the enrichment of multiple host and parasite proteins, in particular of parasite antigens associated with host cell membranes and proteins involved in parasite invasion into RBCs. RMVs are quantitatively released during the asexual parasite cycle prior to parasite egress. RMVs demonstrate potent immunomodulatory properties on human primary macrophages and neutrophils. Additionally, RMVs are internalized by infected red blood cells and stimulate production of transmission stage parasites in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, RMVs mediate cellular communication within the parasite population and with the host innate immune system.

Abstract: Small heat-shock protein chaperones are important players in the protein quality control system of the cell, because they can immediately respond to partially unfolded proteins, thereby protecting the cell from harmful aggregates. The small heat-shock proteins can form large polydisperse oligomers that are exceptionally dynamic, which is implicated in their function of protecting substrate proteins from aggregation. Yet the mechanism of substrate recognition remains poorly understood, and little is known about what parts of the small heat-shock proteins interact with substrates and what parts of a partially unfolded substrate protein interact with the small heat-shock proteins. The transient nature of the interactions that prevent substrate aggregation rationalize probing this interaction by crosslinking mass spectrometry. Here, we used a workflow with lysine-specific crosslinking and offline nano-liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry to explore the interaction between the plant small heat-shock protein Hsp21 and a thermosensitive model substrate protein, malate dehydrogenase. The identified crosslinks point at an interaction between the disordered N-terminal region of Hsp21 and the C-terminal presumably unfolding part of the substrate protein.

Abstract: Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a microtubule based system that supports the assembly and maintenance of cilia. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified two distinct complexes containing multiple proteins that are part of the IFT machinery. In this study we prepared mouse pituitary cells that expressed an epitope-tagged IFT protein and immuno-purified the IFT B complex from these cells. Mass spectrometry analysis of the isolated complex led to identification of a number of well known components of the IFT B complex. In addition, peptides corresponding to mouse tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, TTC30A1, TTC30A2 and TTC30B were identified. The mouse Ttc30A1, Ttc30A2, Ttc30B genes are orthologs of Caenorhabditis elegans dyf-1, which is required for assembly of the distal segment of the cilia. We used co-immunoprecipitation studies to provide evidence that, TTC30A1, TTC30A2 or TTC30B can be incorporated into a complex with a known IFT B protein, IFT52. We also found that TTC30B can interact with mouse KIF17, a kinesin which participates in IFT. In vitro expression in a cell-free system followed by co-immunoprecipitation also provided evidence that TTC30B can directly interact with several different IFT B complex proteins. The findings support the view that mouse TTC30A1, TTC30A2 and TTC30B can contribute to the IFT B complex, likely through interactions with multiple IFT proteins and also suggest a possible link to the molecular motor, KIF17 to support transport of cargo during IFT.

Abstract: Wilms tumor gene WT1 encodes a zinc finger-containing transcription factor which is required for renal development. Mutations in WT1 are observed in 20% of Wilms tumors (a pediatric kidney cancer), but the in vivo WT1 targets and associated molecular pathways involved in the etiology of Wilms tumor are still elusive. To identify WT1 targets we performed genome-wide comprehensive expression profiling using Affymetrix Gene Chip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays, comparing E13.5 mouse kidneys in which Wt1 had been somatically ablated with littermate controls. We identified Usp18 as the most differentially expressed gene in mutant kidney. Using tetracycline inducible cells we demonstrated a repressive effect of WT1 on USP18 expression. Conversely, knockdown of WT1 led to the upregulation of Usp18. Furthermore, direct binding of WT1 to the Usp18 promoter was demonstrated by ChIP assay. Overexpression of USP18 in murine and human cell lines resulted in cell proliferation. Additionally, Usp18 upregulation was observed in a mouse model of Wilms tumor. Taken together our data demonstrate that Usp18 is a transcriptional target of WT1 and suggest that increased expression of USP18 following WT1 loss contributes to Wilms tumorigenesis.

Abstract: We previously observed an unidentified, tyrosine-phosphorylated, membrane-associated, 66–68-kDa protein which was present in the L1210 murine leukemia cells but not present, at least in the tyrosine-phosphorylated form, in cisplatin–methotrexate (CDDP–MTX) cross-resistant L1210/DDP cells. We purified and characterized this 66–68-kDa protein by affinity chromatography purification using its two identified properties, tyrosine phosphorylation and MTX-binding, and yielded a single band of 66–68 kDa. The purified protein was subjected to trypsin digestion and the isolated peptide fragments were sequenced and yielded two partial peptide sequences: VEIIANDQ and VTNAVVTVPAYFNDSQRQA. The two peptide sequences were used to search for the mouse genome at the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) database for Open Reading Frame Sequence (ORFs) containing these peptides using the TBLASTN function. A single gene was identified containing both sequences, the HSPa8 gene, which codes for the heat shock family protein, HSC70. We further demonstrated that HSC70 is a MTX-binding protein using a binding assay with MTX-agarose beads followed by Western blotting. The HSC70 also existed in various cancer cell lines and showed binding to MTX. Additionally, the HSC70 protein, cloned from the L1210 murine leukemia cells, was expressed and purified from E. coli cells using a polyhistidine-tag purification system and it also showed the binding properties with MTX. DnaK, the HSC70 homologue in E. coli, also binds to MTX. By using the purified truncated HSC70 domains, we identified the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain of HSC70 that can bind to MTX. Thus, we have tentatively characterized a new, novel property of HSC70 as a MTX-binding protein.

Abstract: Previous studies suggest that ING4, a novel member of ING (inhibitor of growth) family, can inhibit brain tumor growth. However, whether autophagy is involved in ING4-induced cell death still remains unknown. In this study, we found that in addition to apoptosis, autophagy also contributed to cell death induced by ING4. Autophagy levels were elevated following the exposure to Ad-ING4, including enhanced fluorescence intensity of monodansylcadervarine (MDC), a specific in vivo marker for autophagic vacuoles, and increased expression levels of the LC3-II and Beclin-1, wheras the autophagic levels were attenuated following the pretreatment of 3-MA, the inhibitor of autophagy, which significantly decreased the Ad-ING4-induced cell death compared with caspase inhibitor zVAD. Furthermore, ING4 also induced mitochondrial dysfunction, such as mitophagy, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and the intracellular ROS, which indicated that mitochondria might be associated with the process of autophagic cell death of glioma cells. Finally, the relationship among Bax, Bcl-2, Beclin-1 and caspase family proteins levels were analyzed in glioma cells U251MG and LN229 infected with Ad-ING4 or Ad-lacZ. It is suggested that both autophagy and apoptosis could contribute to ING4-induced glioma cell death, and mitochondria might play an important role in this process. Our findings reveal novel aspects of the autophagy in glioma cells that underlie the cytotoxic action of ING4, possibly providing new insights in the development of combinatorial therapies for gliomas.

Abstract: Human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) bear tremendous clinical potential due to their immunomodulatory properties in transplantation settings and their contribution to tissue regeneration. In fact, they are among the most promising types of stem-like cells for therapeutic applications and are the subject of intense research. However, the clinical use of hBMSCs has been confounded by limitations in their availability; they are scarce cells cumbersome to isolate and purify. Additionally, they are difficult to target to the site of injury in regeneration experiments. In order to combat these limitations, focused extracorporeal shock waves (fESW, 0.2/0.3mJ∗mm−2) were applied to purified, cultured hBMSCs. fESW (0.2mJ∗mm−2) stimulations were found to increase hBMSCs' growth rate (p<0.05), proliferation (p<0.05), migration, cell tracking and wound healing (p<0.05, respectively), as well as to reduce the rate of apoptosis activation (p<0.05). The increase in hBMSC migration behavior was found to be mediated by active remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton as indicated by increased directed stress fiber formations (p<0.05). Furthermore, hBMSCs maintain their differentiation potentials after fESW treatment, whereas 0.2mJ∗mm−2 is the most effective application. In conclusion, our results establish first-timely that hBMSCs' behavior can be modified and optimized in response to defined mechanical stimulation. These findings appear particularly promising as they suggest that mechanical stress preconditions hBMSCs for improved therapeutic performance without genetic manipulations and that mechanically preconditioned hBMSCs will be advantageous for hBMSC-based tissue regeneration. Therefore, this approach opens the door for exploiting the full potential of these cells in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: A binder system containing polyurethane precursors was used to in situ foam (direct foam) an (La0.6Sr0.4)0.98(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3−δ (LSCF) cathode composition on an yttrium-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte coated with a porous ∼10 µm thick cathode active layer. The YSZ electrolyte was ∼110 μm thick, and a fuel cell was created by application of a Ni/(Ce0.9Gd0.1)O2 cermet as the baseline anode. Cells possessing the foamed LSCF cathode were compared to cells constructed via standard methods in terms of resultant microstructure, electrochemical performance, and introceptive character. The foamed cathode tended to possess a high level of tortuous porosity which was ellipsoidal and interconnected in character. Both the standard and foamed cathode structures were subjected to an infiltration process, and the resultant microstructure was examined. The impregnation efficiency of the foamed cathode was at least ∼10% greater per deposition than that of an unfoamed porous LSCF cathode. The SOFC with the Pt nanocatalyst impregnated foamed cathode demonstrated a maximum power density of 593 mW/cm2 utilising wet H2 fuel, which is 52% higher than an SOFC with the baseline Pt-impregnated LSCF cathode (∼390 mW/cm2) at 800°C. The cathode compositional and microstructural alterations obtainable by foaming led to the elevated power performance, which was shown to be quite high relative to standard SOFCs with a thick YSZ electrolyte.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor and is invariably fatal to affected patients. Oxysterols belong to a class of bioactive lipids that are implicated in neurological disease and are associated with various types of cancer. Here, we investigated expression and transcriptional regulation of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) in human U87MG and GM133 glioblastoma cell lines. We demonstrate that in both cell lines transcription and translation of CH25H are increased in response to TNFα and IL1β. In parallel, both cell lines upregulate 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) synthesis and secretion to levels comparable to bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages under inflammatory conditions. To determine whether 25-OHC acts as chemoattractant for tumor-associated macrophages, the human THP-1 monoblastic leukemia cell line was treated with varying amounts of the oxysterol. Experiments revealed that 25-OHC and lipid extracts isolated from GM133-conditioned medium (containing 7-fold higher 25-OHC concentrations than U87MG medium) induce chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells. Of note, 25-OHC also induced the migration of primary human peripheral blood monocytes. In response to exogenously added 25-OHC, THP-1 cells reorganized intermediate filament-associated vimentin to more cortical and polarized structures. Chemotactic migration of monocytes in response to 25-OHC was pertussis toxin-sensitive, indicating the involvement of G protein-coupled receptors. Using RNA interference we demonstrated that G protein–coupled receptor 183 (EBI2) contributes to 25-OHC-mediated chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells. These in vitro data indicate that GBM-derived and secreted 25-OHC may be involved in the recruitment of immune-competent cells to a tumor via EBI2.

Abstract: The stromal reaction surrounding tumors leads to the formation of a tumor-specific microenvironment, which may play either a restrictive role or a supportive role in the growth and progression of the tumors. Lumican, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) of the extracellular matrix (ECM), regulates collagen fibrillogenesis. Recently, lumican has also been shown to regulate cell behavior during embryonic development, tissue repair and tumor progression. The role of lumican in cancer varies according to the type of tumor. In this study we analyze the role of lumican in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer both in vivo and in vitro. Overall lumican up-regulation was observed in the primary tumors analyzed through both real-time PCR and immunostaining. The increase in lumican expression was observed in the reactive stroma surrounding prostate primary tumors with fibrotic deposition surrounding the acinar glands. In vitro analysis demonstrated that lumican inhibited both the migration and invasion of metastatic prostate cancer cells isolated from lymph node, bone and brain. Moreover, prostate cancer cells seeded on lumican presented a decrease in the formation of cellular projections, lamellipodia detected by a decreased rearrangement in ZO-1, keratin 8/18, integrin β1 and MT1-MMP, and invadopodia detected by disruption of α-smooth muscle actin, cortactin and N-WASP. Moreover, a significant increase in prostate cancer cell invasion was observed through the peritoneum of lumican knockout mice, further demonstrating the restrictive role lumican present in the ECM has on prostate cancer invasion. In conclusion, lumican present in the reactive stroma surrounding prostate primary tumors plays a restrictive role on cancer progression, and we therefore postulate that lumican could be a valuable marker in prostate cancer staging.

Abstract: Reducing Cx43 expression stimulates skin wound healing. This is mimicked in models when Cx43 function is blocked by the connexin mimetic peptide Gap27. IGF-I also stimulates wound healing with IGFBP-5 attenuating its actions. Further, the IGF-I to IGFBP-5 ratio is altered in diabetic skin, where wound closure is impaired. We investigated whether Gap27 remains effective in augmenting scrape-wound closure in human skin wound models simulating diabetes-induced changes, using culture conditions with raised glucose, insulin and IGFBP-5. Gap27 increased scrape-wound closure in normal glucose and insulin (NGI) and to a lesser extent in high glucose and insulin (HGI). IGF-I enhanced scrape-wound closure in keratinocytes whereas IGFBP-5 inhibited this response. Gap27 overcame the inhibitory effects of IGFBP-5 on IGF-I activity. Connexin-mediated communication (CMC) was reduced in HGI, despite raised Cx43, and Gap27 significantly decreased CMC in NGI and HGI. IGF-I and IGFBP-5 did not affect CMC. IGF-I increased keratinocyte proliferation in NGI, and Gap27 increased proliferation in NGI to a greater extent than in HGI. We conclude that IGF-I and Gap27 stimulate scrape-wound closure by independent mechanisms with Gap27 inhibiting Cx43 function. Gap27 can enhance wound closure in diabetic conditions, irrespective of the IGF-I:IGFBP-5 balance.

Abstract: Summary
The host response to a virus is determined by intracellular signaling pathways that are modified during infection. These pathways converge as networks and produce interdependent phenotypes, making it difficult to link virus-induced signals and responses at a systems level. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection induces death of cardiomyocytes, causing tissue damage and virus dissemination, through incompletely characterized host cell signaling networks. We built a statistical model that quantitatively predicts cardiomyocyte responses from time-dependent measurements of phosphorylation events modified by CVB3. Model analysis revealed that CVB3-stimulated cytotoxicity involves tight coupling between the host ERK and p38 MAPK pathways, which are generally thought to control distinct cellular responses. The kinase ERK5 requires p38 kinase activity and inhibits apoptosis caused by CVB3 infection. By contrast, p38 indirectly promotes apoptosis via ERK1/2 inhibition but directly causes CVB3-induced necrosis. Thus, the cellular events governing pathogenesis are revealed when virus-host programs are monitored systematically and deconvolved mathematically.

Abstract: Summary
Viral DNA trafficking in cells has large impacts on physiology and disease development. Current methods lack the resolution and accuracy to visualize and quantify viral DNA trafficking at single-molecule resolution. We developed a noninvasive protocol for accurate quantification of viral DNA-genome (vDNA) trafficking in single cells. Ethynyl-modified nucleosides were used to metabolically label newly synthesized adenovirus, herpes virus, and vaccinia virus vDNA, without affecting infectivity. Superresolution microscopy and copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (click) reactions allowed visualization of infection at single vDNA resolution within mammalian cells. Analysis of adenovirus infection revealed that a large pool of capsid-free vDNA accumulated in the cytosol upon virus uncoating, indicating that nuclear import of incoming vDNA is a bottleneck. The method described here is applicable for the entire replication cycle of DNA viruses and offers opportunities to localize cellular and viral effector machineries on newly replicated viral DNA, or innate immune sensors on cytoplasmic viral DNA.

Abstract: Specificity protein 1 (Sp1), a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, plays a potential pathogenic role for fibrotic disease in many organs by regulating the expression of several fibrosis-related genes, however, its role in kidney fibrosis and the mechanisms regulating its expression remain incompletely clarified. Here, we found that Sp1 was markedly induced and closely correlated with interstitial type I collagen accumulation in kidney tubular epithelia from obstructive nephropathy. In vitro, both Sp1 and type I collagen expression were up-regulated in TGF-β1-treated kidney tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E), whereas knockdown of Sp1 largely abolished TGF-β1-induced type I collagen production, suggesting that Sp1 induction is partially responsible for type I collagen expression. In addition, we found that miR-29c expression was remarkably reduced in either the tubular epithelial cells from kidney with UUO nephropathy or TGF-β1-treated NRK-52E cells. Knockdown of miR-29c could sufficiently induce Sp1 and type I collagen expression, whereas ectopic expression of miR-29c largely abolished their expression stimulated by TGF-β1 in NRK-52E cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Sp1 effectively hindered type I collagen induction stimulated by miR-29c down-regulation. Collectively, this study demonstrates that Sp1 acts as an essential mediator for miR-29c in regulating type I collagen production in tubular epithelial cells, which may provide a novel mechanistic insight about miR-29c in renal fibrosis.

Epigallocatechin gallate and sulforaphane combination treatment induce apoptosis in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells through hTERT and Bcl-2 down-regulation,

Abstract: The cellular development of resistance to chemotherapy contributes to the high mortality noted in patients affected by ovarian cancer. Novel compounds that specifically target cellular drug resistance in ovarian cancer are therefore highly desired. Previous epidemiological studies indicate that consumption of green tea and cruciferous vegetables is inversely associated with occurrence of ovarian cancer. Therefore revealing the effects and mechanisms of major components of green tea (epigallocatechin gallate, EGCG) and cruciferous vegetables (sulforaphane, SFN) on ovarian cancer cells will provide necessary knowledge for developing potential novel treatments for the disease. In this study, EGCG or SFN was used to treat both paclitaxel-sensitive (SKOV3-ip1) and -resistant (SKOV3TR-ip2) ovarian cancer cell lines alone or in combination. We found that SFN inhibits cell viability of both ovarian cancer cell lines time- and dose-dependently and that EGCG potentiates the inhibiting effect of SFN on ovarian cancer cells. Cell cycle analysis indicates SFN can arrest ovarian cancer cells in G2/M phase, while EGCG and SFN co-treatment can arrest cells in both G2/M and S phase. Combined EGCG and SFN treatment increases apoptosis significantly in paclitaxel-resistant SKOV3TR-ip2 cells after 6 days of treatment, while reducing the expression of hTERT, the main regulatory subunit of telomerase. Western blotting also indicates that SFN can down-regulate Bcl-2 (a gene involved in anti-apoptosis) protein levels in both cell types. Cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) becomes up-regulated by 6 days of treatment with SFN and this is more pronounced for combination treatment indicating induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, phosphorylated H2AX is up-regulated after 6 days of treatment with SFN alone, and EGCG can potentiate this effect, suggesting that DNA damage is a potential cellular mechanism contributing to the inhibiting effect of EGCG and SFN combination treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that EGCG and SFN combination treatment can induce apoptosis by down-regulating of hTERT and Bcl-2 and promote DNA damage response specifically in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and suggest the use of these compounds for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer treatment.

Abstract: Several potential clinical applications of stem cells rely on their capacity to migrate into sites of inflammation where they contribute to tissue regeneration processes. Inflammatory signals are partially mediated by chemokines acting via their receptors expressed on the target cells. Data concerning the repertoire and biological activities of chemokine receptors in human adipose tissue derived stromal cells (ADSCs) are limited. Here we show that CCR1 is one of the few chemokine receptors expressed in ADSCs at a high level. CCR1 expression varies in ADSCs derived from different donors. It sharply decreases in the early phase of ADSCs in vitro propagation, but further demonstrates relative stability. Expression of CCR1 positively correlates with expression of SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG, transcription factors responsible for maintenance of the stemness properties of the cells. We demonstrate that signaling via CCL5/CCR1 axis triggers migration of ADSCs, activates ERK and AKT kinases, stimulates NFκB transcriptional activity and culminates in increased proliferation of CCR1+ cells accompanied with up-regulation of SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG expression. Our data suggest that chemokine signaling via CCR1 may be involved in regulation of stemness of ADSCs.
