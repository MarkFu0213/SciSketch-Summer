Abstract: Summary
Here, we use optogenetics and chemogenetics to investigate the contribution of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway in aversion and heroin relapse in two different heroin self-administration models in rats. In one model, rats undergo forced abstinence in the home cage prior to relapse testing, and in the other, they undergo extinction training, a procedure that is likened to cognitive behavioral therapy. We find that the PVT→NAc pathway is both sufficient and necessary to drive aversion and heroin seeking after abstinence, but not extinction. The ability of extinction to reduce this pathway’s contribution to heroin relapse is accompanied by a loss of synaptic plasticity in PVT inputs onto a specific subset of NAc neurons. Thus, extinction may exert therapeutic reductions in opioid seeking by altering synaptic plasticity within the PVT→NAc pathway, resulting in reduced aversion during opioid withdrawal as well as reduced relapse propensity.

Abstract: Summary
Microexons (≤27 nt) play critical roles in nervous system development and function but create unique challenges for the splicing machinery. The mechanisms of microexon regulation are therefore of great interest. We performed a genetic screen for alternative splicing regulators in the C. elegans nervous system and identify PRP-40, a core component of the U1 snRNP. RNA-seq reveals that PRP-40 is required for inclusion of alternatively spliced, but not constitutively spliced, exons. PRP-40 is particularly required for inclusion of neuronal microexons, and our data indicate that PRP-40 is a central regulator of microexon splicing. Microexons can be relieved from PRP-40 dependence by artificially increasing exon size or reducing flanking intron size, indicating that PRP-40 is specifically required for microexons surrounded by conventionally sized introns. Knockdown of the orthologous PRPF40A in mouse neuroblastoma cells causes widespread dysregulation of microexons but not conventionally sized exons. PRP-40 regulation of neuronal microexons is therefore a widely conserved phenomenon.

Abstract: Summary
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) preferentially invades into perinephric adipose tissue (PAT), a process associated with poor prognosis. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this interaction remain elusive. Here, we describe a bi-directional communication between ccRCC cells and the PAT. We found that ccRCC cells secrete parathyroid-hormone-related protein (PTHrP) to promote the browning of PAT by PKA activation, while PAT-mediated thermogenesis results in the release of excess lactate to enhance ccRCC growth, invasion, and metastasis. Further, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) extensively used in the treatment of ccRCC enhanced this vicious cycle of ccRCC-PAT communication by promoting the browning of PAT. However, if this cross-communication was short circuited by the pharmacological suppression of adipocyte browning via H89 or KT5720, the anti-tumor efficacy of the TKI, sunitinib, was enhanced. These results suggest that ccRCC-PAT cross-communication has important clinical relevance, and use of combined therapy holds great promise in enhancing the efficacy of TKIs.

Abstract: Summary
Citrate lies at a critical node of metabolism, linking tricarboxylic acid metabolism and lipogenesis via acetyl-coenzyme A. Recent studies have observed that deficiency of the sodium-dependent citrate transporter (NaCT), encoded by SLC13A5, dysregulates hepatic metabolism and drives pediatric epilepsy. To examine how NaCT contributes to citrate metabolism in cells relevant to the pathophysiology of these diseases, we apply 13C isotope tracing to SLC13A5-deficient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and primary rat cortical neurons. Exogenous citrate appreciably contributes to intermediary metabolism only under hypoxic conditions. In the absence of glutamine, citrate supplementation increases de novo lipogenesis and growth of HCC cells. Knockout of SLC13A5 in Huh7 cells compromises citrate uptake and catabolism. Citrate supplementation rescues Huh7 cell viability in response to glutamine deprivation or Zn2+ treatment, and NaCT deficiency mitigates these effects. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that NaCT-mediated citrate uptake is metabolically important under nutrient-limited conditions and may facilitate resistance to metal toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac metabolism is a high-oxygen-consuming process, showing a preference for long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) as the fuel source under physiological conditions. However, a metabolic switch (favoring glucose instead of LCFA) is commonly reported in ischemic or late-stage failing hearts. The mechanism regulating this metabolic switch remains poorly understood. Here, we report that loss of PHD2/3, the cellular oxygen sensors, blocks LCFA mitochondria uptake and β-oxidation in cardiomyocytes. In high-fat-fed mice, PHD2/3 deficiency improves glucose metabolism but exacerbates the cardiac defects. Mechanistically, we find that PHD2/3 bind to CPT1B, a key enzyme of mitochondrial LCFA uptake, promoting CPT1B-P295 hydroxylation. Further, we show that CPT1B-P295 hydroxylation is indispensable for its interaction with VDAC1 and LCFA β-oxidation. Finally, we demonstrate that a CPT1B-P295A mutant constitutively binds to VDAC1 and rescues LCFA metabolism in PHD2/3-deficient cardiomyocytes. Together, our data identify an oxygen-sensitive regulatory axis involved in cardiac metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) requires preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly at gene promoters. In the dynamic nucleus, where thousands of promoters are broadly distributed in chromatin, it is unclear how multiple individual components converge on any target to establish the PIC. Here we use live-cell, single-molecule tracking in S. cerevisiae to visualize constrained exploration of the nucleoplasm by PIC components and Mediator’s key role in guiding this process. On chromatin, TFIID/TATA-binding protein (TBP), Mediator, and RNA Pol II instruct assembly of a short-lived PIC, which occurs infrequently but efficiently within a few seconds on average. Moreover, PIC exclusion by nucleosome encroachment underscores regulated promoter accessibility by chromatin remodeling. Thus, coordinated nuclear exploration and recruitment to accessible targets underlies dynamic PIC establishment in yeast. Our study provides a global spatiotemporal model for transcription initiation in live cells.

Abstract: Summary
The clinical success of EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-mutant lung cancer is limited by the eventual development of acquired resistance. We hypothesize that enhancing apoptosis through combination therapies can eradicate cancer cells and reduce the emergence of drug-tolerant persisters. Through high-throughput screening of a custom library of ∼1,000 compounds, we discover Aurora B kinase inhibitors as potent enhancers of osimertinib-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, Aurora B inhibition stabilizes BIM through reduced Ser87 phosphorylation, and transactivates PUMA through FOXO1/3. Importantly, osimertinib resistance caused by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activates the ATR-CHK1-Aurora B signaling cascade and thereby engenders hypersensitivity to respective kinase inhibitors by activating BIM-mediated mitotic catastrophe. Combined inhibition of EGFR and Aurora B not only efficiently eliminates cancer cells but also overcomes resistance beyond EMT.

Abstract: Summary
Reversible monoubiquitination of small subunit ribosomal proteins RPS2/uS5 and RPS3/uS3 has been noted to occur on ribosomes involved in ZNF598-dependent mRNA surveillance. Subsequent deubiquitination of RPS2 and RPS3 by USP10 is critical for recycling of stalled ribosomes in a process known as ribosome-associated quality control. Here, we identify and characterize the RPS2- and RPS3-specific E3 ligase Really Interesting New Gene (RING) finger protein 10 (RNF10) and its role in translation. Overexpression of RNF10 increases 40S ribosomal subunit degradation similarly to the knockout of USP10. Although a substantial fraction of RNF10-mediated RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination results from ZNF598-dependent sensing of collided ribosomes, ZNF598-independent impairment of translation initiation and elongation also contributes to RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination. RNF10 photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) identifies crosslinked mRNAs, tRNAs, and 18S rRNAs, indicating recruitment of RNF10 to ribosomes stalled in translation. These impeded ribosomes are tagged by ubiquitin at their 40S subunit for subsequent programmed degradation unless rescued by USP10.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, have an elevated incidence of congenital heart disease, but the extent to which these conditions share molecular mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we use network genetics to identify a convergent molecular network underlying autism and congenital heart disease. This network is impacted by damaging genetic variants from both disorders in multiple independent cohorts of patients, pinpointing 101 genes with shared genetic risk. Network analysis also implicates risk genes for each disorder separately, including 27 previously unidentified genes for autism and 46 for congenital heart disease. For 7 genes with shared risk, we create engineered disruptions in Xenopus tropicalis, confirming both heart and brain developmental abnormalities. The network includes a family of ion channels, such as the sodium transporter SCN2A, linking these functions to early heart and brain development. This study provides a road map for identifying risk genes and pathways involved in co-morbid conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Alveolar epithelial type 2 cell (AEC2) dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of adult and pediatric interstitial lung disease (ILD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); however, identification of disease-initiating mechanisms has been impeded by inability to access primary AEC2s early on. Here, we present a human in vitro model permitting investigation of epithelial-intrinsic events culminating in AEC2 dysfunction, using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying an AEC2-exclusive disease-associated variant (SFTPCI73T). Comparing syngeneic mutant versus gene-corrected iPSCs after differentiation into AEC2s (iAEC2s), we find that mutant iAEC2s accumulate large amounts of misprocessed and mistrafficked pro-SFTPC protein, similar to in vivo changes, resulting in diminished AEC2 progenitor capacity, perturbed proteostasis, altered bioenergetic programs, time-dependent metabolic reprogramming, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway activation. Treatment of SFTPCI73T-expressing iAEC2s with hydroxychloroquine, a medication used in pediatric ILD, aggravates the observed perturbations. Thus, iAEC2s provide a patient-specific preclinical platform for modeling the epithelial-intrinsic dysfunction at ILD inception.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic coupling of Schwann cells (SCs) and peripheral axons is poorly understood. Few molecules in SCs are known to regulate axon stability. Using SC-specific Rheb knockout mice, we demonstrate that Rheb-regulated mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is critical for SC-mediated non-cell-autonomous regulation of peripheral axon stability. Rheb knockout suppresses pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity (independently of mTORC1) and shifts pyruvate metabolism toward lactate production in SCs. The increased lactate causes age-dependent peripheral axon degeneration, affecting peripheral nerve function. Lactate, as an energy substrate and a potential signaling molecule, enhanced neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and energy production of peripheral nerves. Albeit beneficial to injured peripheral axons in the short term, we show that persistently increased lactate metabolism of neurons enhances ROS production, eventually damaging mitochondria, neuroenergetics, and axon stability. This study highlights the complex roles of lactate metabolism to peripheral axons and the importance of lactate homeostasis in preserving peripheral nerves.

Abstract: Summary
The CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib (PAL), significantly improves progression-free survival in HR+/HER2− breast cancer when combined with anti-hormonals. We sought to discover PAL resistance mechanisms in preclinical models and through analysis of clinical transcriptome specimens, which coalesced on induction of MYC oncogene and Cyclin E/CDK2 activity. We propose that targeting the G1 kinases CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 with a small-molecule overcomes resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. We describe the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of PF-06873600 (PF3600), a pyridopyrimidine with potent inhibition of CDK2/4/6 activity and efficacy in multiple in vivo tumor models. Together with the clinical analysis, MYC activity predicts (PF3600) efficacy across multiple cell lineages. Finally, we find that CDK2/4/6 inhibition does not compromise tumor-specific immune checkpoint blockade responses in syngeneic models. We anticipate that (PF3600), currently in phase 1 clinical trials, offers a therapeutic option to cancer patients in whom CDK4/6 inhibition is insufficient to alter disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Our knowledge of genomic imprinting in primates is lagging behind that of mice largely because of the difficulties of allelic analyses in outbred animals. To understand imprinting dynamics in primates, we profiled transcriptomes, DNA methylomes, and H3K27me3 in uniparental monkey embryos. We further developed single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP)-free methods, TARSII and CARSII, to identify germline differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in somatic tissues. Our comprehensive analyses showed that allelic DNA methylation, but not H3K27me3, is a major mark that correlates with paternal-biasedly expressed genes (PEGs) in uniparental monkey embryos. Interestingly, primate germline DMRs are different from PEG-associated DMRs in early embryos and are enriched in placenta. Strikingly, most placenta-specific germline DMRs are lost in placenta of cloned monkeys. Collectively, our study establishes SNP-free germline DMR identification methods, defines developmental imprinting dynamics in primates, and demonstrates imprinting defects in cloned monkey placenta, which provides important clues for improving primate cloning.

Abstract: Enhancers have been conventionally perceived as cis-acting elements that provide binding sites for trans-acting factors. However, recent studies have shown that enhancers are transcribed and that these transcripts, called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), have a regulatory function. Here, we identified putative eRNAs by profiling and determining the overlap between noncoding RNA expression loci and eRNA-associated histone marks such as H3K27ac and H3K4me1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Of the 132 HCC-derived noncoding RNAs, 74 overlapped with the eRNA loci defined by the FANTOM consortium, and 65 were located in the proximal regions of genes differentially expressed between normal and tumor tissues in TCGA dataset. Interestingly, knockdown of two selected putative eRNAs, THUMPD3-AS1 and LINC01572, led to downregulation of their target mRNAs and to a reduction in the proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Additionally, the expression of these two noncoding RNAs and target mRNAs was elevated in tumor samples in the TCGA dataset, and high expression was associated with poor survival of patients. Collectively, our study suggests that noncoding RNAs such as THUMPD3-AS1 and LINC01572 (i.e., putative eRNAs) can promote the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation and that the dysregulation of these noncoding RNAs can cause cancers such as HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Histone variants are crucial regulators of chromatin structure and gene transcription, yet their functions within the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that the H2A histone variant H2A.Z is essential for neuronal survival. Mice lacking H2A.Z in GABAergic neurons or Purkinje cells (PCs) present with a progressive cerebellar ataxia accompanied by widespread degeneration of PCs. Ablation of H2A.Z in other neuronal subtypes also triggers cell death. H2A.Z binds to the promoters of key nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes to regulate their expression and promote organelle function. Bolstering mitochondrial activity genetically or by organelle transplant enhances the survival of H2A.Z-ablated neurons. Changes in bioenergetic status alter H2A.Z occupancy at the promoters of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, an adaptive response essential for cell survival. Our results highlight that H2A.Z fulfills a key, conserved role in neuronal survival by acting as a transcriptional rheostat to regulate the expression of genes critical to mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Summary
The power of Drosophila melanogaster as a model system relies on tractable germline genetic manipulations. Despite Drosophila’s expansive genetics toolbox, such manipulations are still accomplished one change at a time and depend predominantly on phenotypic screening. We describe a drug-based genetic platform consisting of four selection and two counterselection markers, eliminating the need to screen for modified progeny. These markers work reliably individually or in combination to produce specific genetic outcomes. We demonstrate three example applications of multiplexed drug-based genetics by generating (1) transgenic animals, expressing both components of binary overexpression systems in a single transgenesis step; (2) dual selectable and counterselectable balancer chromosomes; and (3) selectable, fluorescently tagged P[acman] bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) strains. We perform immunoprecipitation followed by proteomic analysis on one tagged BAC line, demonstrating our platform’s applicability to biological discovery. Lastly, we provide a plasmid library resource to facilitate custom transgene design and technology transfer to other model systems.

The successful migration of the osteoblasts to the diseased bones of rats in C/HA-NPs and HA-NPs groups was evidenced by PCR screening of the Y-linked sex-determining gene (SRY) in the femoral bone tissue. Serum bone biomarker levels and gene expression patterns of cathepsin K, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were assessed. Additionally, histological examination of the femoral bone tissues of rats was performed. The current outcomes revealed that osteoblast implantation, resulted from C/HA-NPs or HA-NPs group, significantly lessened bone sialoprotein level. In Addition, it yielded a significant decline in the gene expression patterns of cathepsin K, RANKL, and RANKL/OPG proportion as well as up-regulation in BMP-2 and Runx-2 gene expression levels as opposed to the untreated ovariectomized animals. Moreover, it could restrain bone resorption and refine bone histoarchitecture. Conclusively, this study sheds light on the therapeutic significance of osteoblasts transplantation in alleviating the intensity of the bone remodeling cycle, consequently representing a hopeful therapeutic approach for primary osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
The dramatically expanding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) needs multiple effective countermeasures. Neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. Here, we characterize several receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific Nbs isolated from an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (S); among them, three Nbs exhibit picomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To improve their efficacy, various configurations of Nbs are engineered. Nb15-NbH-Nb15, a trimer constituted of three Nbs, is constructed to be bispecific for human serum albumin (HSA) and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibits single-digit ng/ml neutralization potency against the wild-type and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 with a long half-life in vivo. In addition, we show that intranasal administration of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 provides effective protection for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes against SARS-CoV-2 infection in transgenic hACE2 mice. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 is a potential candidate for both the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory administration.

Abstract: Summary
Elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) by an HIV vaccine will involve priming the immune system to activate antibody precursors, followed by boosting immunizations to select for antibodies with functional features required for neutralization breadth. The higher the number of acquired mutations necessary for function, the more convoluted are the antibody developmental pathways. HIV bnAbs acquire a large number of somatic mutations, but not all mutations are functionally important. In this study, we identify a minimal subset of mutations sufficient for the function of the naturally occurring V3-glycan bnAb DH270.6. Using antibody library screening, candidate envelope immunogens that interact with DH270.6-like antibodies containing this set of key mutations are identified and selected in vitro. Our results demonstrate that less complex B cell evolutionary pathways than those naturally observed exist for the induction of HIV bnAbs by vaccination, and they establish rational approaches to identify boosting candidate immunogens.

Abstract: Infections resulting from Mycobacterium abscessus are increasing in prevalence worldwide, with the greatest risk posed to patients with underlying respiratory conditions. Treatment for infections is difficult due to wide ranging intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, which is compounded by the existence of a range of subspecies within the M. abscessus complex, each with varying additional antimicrobial resistance profiles. Previously, the use of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors within a combination therapy has been proposed as an effective treatment option for pulmonary M. abscessus infections. Here, we assess the in vitro efficacy of two non-β-lactam based inhibitors, relebactam and avibactam, as agents against M. abscessus with their respective partner drugs imipenem and ceftazidime, as well as in triplicate combinations with additional β-lactam antibiotics against the M. abscessus complex. We have shown that the commercially available ratio of imipenem to relebactam is the appropriate ratio for bactericidal activity against M. abscessus, whereas the ratio between ceftazidime and avibactam is redundant, due to inactivity of ceftazidime to inhibit the bacteria. We have identified that the use of imipenem and meropenem alongside either relebactam or avibactam yield low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) for each M. abscessus subspecies, which are within the therapeutically achievable concentration ranges within the epithelial lining fluid of the lungs. We propose the implementation of imipenem with relebactam in place of stand-alone imipenem into the current treatment regime, alongside meropenem, as a future front-line treatment option for M. abscessus complex infections.

Abstract: Summary
Directed evolution of proteins often involves a greedy optimization in which the mutation in the highest-fitness variant identified in each round of single-site mutagenesis is fixed. The efficiency of such a single-step greedy walk depends on the order in which beneficial mutations are identified—the process is path dependent. Here, we investigate and optimize a path-independent machine learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) protocol that allows in silico screening of full combinatorial libraries. In particular, we evaluate the importance of different protein encoding strategies, training procedures, models, and training set design strategies on MLDE outcome, finding the most important consideration to be the implementation of strategies that reduce inclusion of minimally informative “holes” (protein variants with zero or extremely low fitness) in training data. When applied to an epistatic, hole-filled, four-site combinatorial fitness landscape, our optimized protocol achieved the global fitness maximum up to 81-fold more frequently than single-step greedy optimization. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: A central problem in developmental biology is to understand how cells interpret their positional information to give rise to spatial patterns, such as the process of periodic segmentation of the vertebrate embryo into somites. For decades, somite formation has been interpreted according to the clock-and-wavefront model. In this conceptual framework, molecular oscillators set the frequency of somite formation while the positional information is encoded in signaling gradients. Recent experiments using ex vivo explants have challenged this interpretation, suggesting that positional information is encoded in the properties of the oscillators, independent of long-range modulations such as signaling gradients. Here, we propose that positional information is encoded in the difference in the levels of neighboring oscillators. The differences gradually increase because both the amplitude and the period of the oscillators increase with time. When this difference exceeds a certain threshold, the segmentation program starts. Using this framework, we quantitatively fit experimental data from in vivo and ex vivo mouse segmentation, and propose mechanisms of somite scaling. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of spatial pattern formation based on the local interactions between dynamic molecular oscillators.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is extensively remodelled during the development of professional secretory cells to cope with high protein production. Since ER is the principal Ca2+ store in the cell, we characterised the Ca2+ homeostasis in NALM-6 and RPMI 8226 cells, which are commonly used as human pre-B and antibody secreting plasma cell models, respectively. Expression levels of Sec61 translocons and the corresponding Sec61-mediated Ca2+ leak from ER, Ca2+ storage capacity and store-operated Ca2+ entry were significantly enlarged in the secretory RPMI 8226 cell line. Using an immunoglobulin M heavy chain producing HeLa cell model, we found that the enlarged Ca2+ storage capacity and Ca2+ leak from ER are linked to ER expansion. Our data delineates a developmental remodelling of Ca2+ homeostasis in professional secretory cells in which a high Sec61-mediated Ca2+ leak and, thus, a high Ca2+ turnover in the ER is backed up by enhanced store-operated Ca2+ entry.

Abstract: Summary
Very-low-frequency oscillations in microvascular diameter cause fluctuations in oxygen delivery that are important for fueling the brain and for functional imaging. However, little is known about how the brain regulates ongoing oscillations in cerebral blood flow. In mouse and rat cortical brain slice arterioles, we find that selectively enhancing tone is sufficient to recruit a TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ elevation in adjacent astrocyte endfeet. This endfoot Ca2+ signal triggers COX-1-mediated “feedback vasodilators” that limit the extent of evoked vasoconstriction, as well as constrain fictive vasomotion in slices. Astrocyte-Ptgs1 knockdown in vivo increases the power of arteriole oscillations across a broad range of very low frequencies (0.01–0.3 Hz), including ultra-slow vasomotion (∼0.1 Hz). Conversely, clamping astrocyte Ca2+ in vivo reduces the power of vasomotion. These data demonstrate bidirectional communication between arterioles and astrocyte endfeet to regulate oscillatory microvasculature activity.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblasts residing in the connective tissues constitute the stem cell niche, particularly in organs such as skin. Although the effect of fibroblasts on stem cell niches and organ aging is an emerging concept, the underlying mechanisms are largely unresolved. We report a mechanism of redox-dependent activation of transcription factor JunB, which, through concomitant upregulation of p16INK4A and repression of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), initiates the installment of fibroblast senescence. Fibroblast senescence profoundly disrupts the metabolic and structural niche, and its essential interactions with different stem cells thus enforces depletion of stem cells pools and skin tissue decline. In fact, silencing of JunB in a fibroblast-niche-specific manner—by reinstatement of IGF-1 and p16 levels—restores skin stem cell pools and overall skin tissue integrity. Here, we report a role of JunB in the control of connective tissue niche and identified targets to combat skin aging and associated pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) injury is a major cause of adverse outcomes of revascularization after myocardial infarction. To identify the fundamental regulator of reperfusion injury, we performed metabolomics profiling in plasma of individuals before and after revascularization and identified a marked accumulation of arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12)-dependent 12-HETE following revascularization. The potent induction of 12-HETE proceeded by reperfusion was conserved in post-MIR in mice, pigs, and monkeys. While genetic inhibition of Alox12 protected mouse hearts from reperfusion injury and remodeling, Alox12 overexpression exacerbated MIR injury. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of ALOX12 significantly reduced cardiac injury in mice, pigs, and monkeys. Unexpectedly, ALOX12 promotes cardiomyocyte injury beyond its enzymatic activity and production of 12-HETE but also by its suppression of AMPK activity via a direct interaction with its upstream kinase TAK1. Taken together, our study demonstrates that ALOX12 is a novel AMPK upstream regulator in the post-MIR heart and that it represents a conserved therapeutic target for the treatment of myocardial reperfusion injury.

Abstract: Summary
Ultraviolet (UV) light affects endocrinological and behavioral aspects of sexuality via an unknown mechanism. Here we discover that ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure enhances the levels of sex-steroid hormones and sexual behavior, which are mediated by the skin. In female mice, UVB exposure increases hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis hormone levels, resulting in larger ovaries; extends estrus days; and increases anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) expression. UVB exposure also enhances the sexual responsiveness and attractiveness of females and male-female interactions. Conditional knockout of p53 specifically in skin keratinocytes abolishes the effects of UVB. Thus, UVB triggers a skin-brain-gonadal axis through skin p53 activation. In humans, solar exposure enhances romantic passion in both genders and aggressiveness in men, as seen in analysis of individual questionaries, and positively correlates with testosterone level. Our findings suggest opportunities for treatment of sex-steroid-related dysfunctions.

Abstract: Summary
Non-degradative ubiquitin chains and phosphorylation events govern signaling responses by innate immune receptors. The deubiquitinase CYLD in complex with SPATA2 is recruited to receptor signaling complexes by the ubiquitin ligase LUBAC and regulates Met1- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin and receptor signaling outcomes. Here, we investigate the molecular determinants of CYLD activity. We reveal that two CAP-Gly domains in CYLD are ubiquitin-binding domains and demonstrate a requirement of CAP-Gly3 for CYLD activity and regulation of immune receptor signaling. Moreover, we identify a phosphorylation switch outside of the catalytic USP domain, which activates CYLD toward Lys63-linked polyubiquitin. The phosphorylated residue Ser568 is a novel tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-regulated phosphorylation site in CYLD and works in concert with Ser418 to enable CYLD-mediated deubiquitination and immune receptor signaling. We propose that phosphorylated CYLD, together with SPATA2 and LUBAC, functions as a ubiquitin-editing complex that balances Lys63- and Met1-linked polyubiquitin at receptor signaling complexes to promote LUBAC signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Remdesivir (RDV), a nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum features, has exhibited effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment. However, the precise working mechanism of RDV when targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) has not been fully elucidated. Here, we solve a 3.0-Å structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RdRP elongation complex (EC) and assess RDV intervention in polymerase elongation phase. Although RDV could induce an “i+3” delayed termination in meta-stable complexes, only pausing and subsequent elongation are observed in the EC. A comparative investigation using an enterovirus RdRP further confirms similar delayed intervention and demonstrates that steric hindrance of the RDV-characteristic 1′-cyano at the −4 position is responsible for the “i+3” intervention, although two representative Flaviviridae RdRPs do not exhibit similar behavior. A comparison of representative viral RdRP catalytic complex structures indicates that the product RNA backbone encounters highly conserved structural elements, highlighting the broad-spectrum intervention potential of 1′-modified nucleotide analogs in anti-RNA virus drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-initiating stem cells (TSCs) are critical for drug resistance and immune escape. However, the mutual regulations between TSC and tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unclear. Using DNA-label retaining, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and other approaches, we investigated intestinal adenoma in response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT), thus identifying therapy-resistant TSCs (TrTSCs). We find bidirectional crosstalk between TSCs and TME using CellPhoneDB analysis. An intriguing finding is that TSCs shape TME into a landscape that favors TSCs for immunosuppression and propagation. Using adenoma-organoid co-cultures, niche-cell depletion, and lineaging tracing, we characterize a functional role of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)-dependent signaling, predominantly occurring between tumor-associated monocytes and macrophages (TAMMs) and TrTSCs. We show that TAMMs promote TrTSC proliferation through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-PTGER4(EP4) signaling, which enhances β-catenin activity via AKT phosphorylation. Thus, our study shows that the bidirectional crosstalk between TrTSC and TME results in a pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive contexture.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages that are more transmissible and resistant to currently approved antibody therapies poses a considerable challenge to the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, the need for ongoing discovery efforts to identify broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance. Here, we report a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies isolated using the linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing (LIBRA-seq) technology from an individual who recovered from COVID-19. Of these antibodies, 54042-4 shows potent neutralization against authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses, including variants of concern (VOCs). A cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of 54042-4 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike reveals an epitope composed of residues that are highly conserved in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Further, 54042-4 possesses uncommon genetic and structural characteristics that distinguish it from other potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Together, these findings provide motivation for the development of 54042-4 as a lead candidate to counteract current and future SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial DNA gyrase complex (GyrA/GyrB) plays a crucial role during DNA replication and serves as a target for multiple antibiotics, including the fluoroquinolones. Despite it being a valuable antibiotics target, resistance emergence by pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa are proving problematic. Here, we describe Igy, a peptide inhibitor of gyrase, encoded by Pseudomonas bacteriophage LUZ24 and other members of the Bruynoghevirus genus. Igy (5.6 kDa) inhibits in vitro gyrase activity and interacts with the P. aeruginosa GyrB subunit, possibly by DNA mimicry, as indicated by a de novo model of the peptide and mutagenesis. In vivo, overproduction of Igy blocks DNA replication and leads to cell death also in fluoroquinolone-resistant bacterial isolates. These data highlight the potential of discovering phage-inspired leads for antibiotics development, supported by co-evolution, as Igy may serve as a scaffold for small molecule mimicry to target the DNA gyrase complex, without cross-resistance to existing molecules.

Abstract: In early pregnancy, hypoxia is a typical extrinsic factor that regulates EVT functions including proliferation, migration and invasion which are essential for a successful pregnancy. Human differentiated embryonic chondrocyte-expressed gene 1 (DEC1), a hypoxia-regulated gene, has been reported to be overexpressed in several types of cancers. Given that the placenta and the cancer share several similarities with respect to their capacity to proliferate and invade adjacent tissues, we focused on the role of DEC1 on trophoblast function in a physiologically hypoxic environment, which may be associated with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA).In our study, we measured the expression of HIF-1α and DEC1 in first-trimester villi through real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis. in vitro, DEC1 expression was downregulated in trophoblast cells via DEC1-specific shRNA plasmid transfection. The expression of DEC1 and HIF-1α was detected via western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. The proliferation and migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells were assayed using CCK-8 and Transwell migration assays, respectively.Our results indicated that the expression of DEC1 was significantly reduced in villi of URSA compared to that in normal pregnant women. in vitro, hypoxia induced the expression of HIF-1ɑ and DEC1 and upregulated proliferation and migration of the HTR-8/SVneo cells. Knockdown of DEC1 inhibited proliferation and migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells exposure to hypoxia. Furthermore, inhibition of HIF1α expression resulted in a significant decrease in DEC1. These findings illustrate that hypoxia-induced DEC1 expression promotes trophoblast cell proliferation and migration through the HIF1α signaling pathway, which plays an important role during placentation.

Abstract: Summary
Primary σ70 factors are key conserved bacterial regulatory proteins that interact with regulatory DNA to control gene expression. It is, however, poorly understood whether σ70 sequence diversity in different bacteria reflects functional differences. Here, we employ comparative and functional genomics to explore the sequence and function relationship of primary σ70. Using multiplex automated genome engineering and deep sequencing (MAGE-seq), we generate a saturation mutagenesis library and high-resolution fitness map of E. coli σ70 in domains 2–4. Mapping natural σ70 sequence diversity to the E. coli σ70 fitness landscape reveals significant predicted fitness deficits across σ70 orthologs. Interestingly, these predicted deficits are larger than observed fitness changes for 15 σ70 orthologs introduced into E. coli. Finally, we use a multiplexed transcriptional reporter assay and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to explore functional differences of several σ70 orthologs. This work provides an in-depth analysis of σ70 sequence and function to improve efforts to understand the evolution and engineering potential of this global regulator.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are critical mediators of self-tolerance, but they can also limit effective anti-tumor immunity. Although under homeostasis a small fraction of Treg cells in lymphoid organs express the putative checkpoint molecule Tim-3, this protein is expressed by a much larger proportion of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells. Using a mouse model that drives cell-type-specific inducible Tim-3 expression, we show that expression of Tim-3 by Treg cells is sufficient to drive Treg cells to a more effector-like phenotype, resulting in increases in suppressive activity, effector T cell exhaustion, and tumor growth. We also show that T-reg-cell-specific inducible deletion of Tim-3 enhances anti-tumor immunity. Enhancement of Treg cell function by Tim-3 is strongly correlated with increased expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and a shift to a more glycolytic metabolic phenotype. Our data demonstrate that Tim-3+ Treg cells may be a relevant therapeutic target cell type for the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a well-known anti-neoplastic agent that is widely employed to treat several types of malignancies. The current study was designed to investigate the renoprotective potential of berberine (BEB) on the doxorubicin (DOX)-induced nephrotoxicity and renal fibrosis. Rats were allocated into four groups; Negative Control, DOX nephrotoxic-induced group received a single dose of DOX (20 mg/kg, i.p.), BEB-group received (50 mg/kg, p.o.) for 14 days, and co-treatment group BEB + DOX where rats were pre-treated with BEB for 10 successive days, then received a single dose of DOX on the 11th day, followed by 4 days of receiving BEB. DOX resulted in nephrotoxicity manifested by significant increments in urea, creatinine, and kidney injury molecule (KIM-1), these biochemical findings were supported with the histopathological lesions in renal tissues. Moreover, DOX provoked oxidative stress through enhancing renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents, and decreased renal catalase (CAT) activity. DOX triggered renal fibrosis represented by increased transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) and elevated collagen deposition. DOX stimulated apoptosis and inflammation in renal tissues as confirmed by increased immunoexpression of caspase-3 and NF-κB, respectively. These effects were alleviated by BEB co-treatment. Co-treatment with BEB markedly prohibited DOX-induced oxidative damage, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis in renal tissue. Histopathological and immunohistochemical investigations showed the nephroprotective potential of BEB on renal injury, which was consistent with the biochemical findings. Accordingly, it could be concluded that the nephroprotective potential of BEB against DOX-induced kidney injury and fibrosis might be mediated by the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis activities.

Abstract: Summary
Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is one of two critical mechanisms utilized in humans to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Unrepaired or incorrect repair of DSBs can lead to apoptosis or cancer. NHEJ involves several proteins, including the Ku70/80 heterodimer, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), X-ray cross-complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), XRCC4-like factor (XLF), and ligase IV. These core proteins bind DSBs and ligate the damaged DNA ends. However, details of the structural assembly of these proteins remain unclear. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of NHEJ supercomplexes that are composed of these core proteins and DNA, revealing the detailed structural architecture of this assembly. We describe monomeric and dimeric forms of this supercomplex and also propose the existence of alternate dimeric forms of long-range synaptic complexes. Finally, we show that mutational disruption of several structural features within these NHEJ complexes negatively affects DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
PRIMPOL repriming allows DNA replication to skip DNA lesions, leading to ssDNA gaps. These gaps must be filled to preserve genome stability. Using a DNA fiber approach to directly monitor gap filling, we studied the post-replicative mechanisms that fill the ssDNA gaps generated in cisplatin-treated cells upon increased PRIMPOL expression or when replication fork reversal is defective because of SMARCAL1 inactivation or PARP inhibition. We found that a mechanism dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD18, PCNA monoubiquitination, and the REV1 and POLζ translesion synthesis polymerases promotes gap filling in G2. The E2-conjugating enzyme UBC13, the RAD51 recombinase, and REV1-POLζ are instead responsible for gap filling in S, suggesting that temporally distinct pathways of gap filling operate throughout the cell cycle. Furthermore, we found that BRCA1 and BRCA2 promote gap filling by limiting MRE11 activity and that simultaneously targeting fork reversal and gap filling enhances chemosensitivity in BRCA-deficient cells.

Abstract: Summary
Inappropriate CD4+ T helper (Th) differentiation can compromise host immunity or promote autoimmune disease. To identify disease-relevant regulators of T cell fate, we examined mutations that modify risk for multiple sclerosis (MS), a canonical organ-specific autoimmune disease. This analysis identified a role for Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox (ZEB1). Deletion of ZEB1 protects against experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Mechanistically, ZEB1 in CD4+ T cells is required for pathogenic Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Genomic analyses of paired human and mouse expression data elucidated an unexpected role for ZEB1 in JAK-STAT signaling. ZEB1 inhibits miR-101-3p that represses JAK2 expression, STAT3/STAT4 phosphorylation, and subsequent expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). Underscoring its clinical relevance, ZEB1 and JAK2 downregulation decreases pathogenic cytokines expression in T cells from MS patients. Moreover, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved JAK2 inhibitor is effective in EAE. Collectively, these findings identify a conserved, potentially targetable mechanism regulating disease-relevant inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene drives Huntington’s disease (HD) pathogenesis and is modulated by DNA damage repair pathways. In this context, the interaction between FAN1, a DNA-structure-specific nuclease, and MLH1, member of the DNA mismatch repair pathway (MMR), is not defined. Here, we identify a highly conserved SPYF motif at the N terminus of FAN1 that binds to MLH1. Our data support a model where FAN1 has two distinct functions to stabilize CAG repeats. On one hand, it binds MLH1 to restrict its recruitment by MSH3, thus inhibiting the assembly of a functional MMR complex that would otherwise promote CAG repeat expansion. On the other hand, it promotes accurate repair via its nuclease activity. These data highlight a potential avenue for HD therapeutics in attenuating somatic expansion.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00467 plays a proto-oncogenic role in non-small cell lung cancer. However, its effect and modulatory mechanism in gastric cancer (GC) are unknown. Thereby, we elucidated the mechanism of LINC00467 in GC. LINC00467 level in GC tissues was assessed by bioinformatic analysis, and clinicopathological parameters from GC patients were collected. The levels of LINC00467, integrin subunit beta 3 (ITGB3), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in tissue samples or treated GC cells were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or Western blot. The viability, proliferation and apoptosis of GC cells were detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry. Levels of LINC00467 and ITGB3 were up-regulated in GC, and highly expressed LINC00467 was positively associated with tumor size, differentiation, N stage, and T stage in GC patients. LINC00467 was enriched in cytoplasm of GC cells, and overexpressed LINC00467 promoted the viability and proliferation as well as levels of ITGB3 and PCNA, while suppressing the apoptosis and levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP1 in GC cells. Besides, the effects of shLINC00467 on inhibiting cell viability, proliferation of GC cells and PCNA level and promoting apoptosis as well as levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP1 were all partially reversed by overexpressed ITGB3. Overexpressed LINC00467 enhanced the viability and proliferation but inhibited apoptosis of GC cells via increasing ITGB3 level.

Abstract: Summary
SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and ATAC (Ada-two-A-containing) are two related coactivator complexes, sharing the same histone acetyltransferase (HAT) subunit. The HAT activities of SAGA and ATAC are required for metazoan development, but the role of these complexes in RNA polymerase II transcription is less understood. To determine whether SAGA and ATAC have redundant or specific functions, we compare the effects of HAT inactivation in each complex with that of inactivation of either SAGA or ATAC core subunits in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We show that core subunits of SAGA or ATAC are required for complex assembly and mouse ESC growth and self-renewal. Surprisingly, depletion of HAT module subunits causes a global decrease in histone H3K9 acetylation, but does not result in significant phenotypic or transcriptional defects. Thus, our results indicate that SAGA and ATAC are differentially required for self-renewal of mouse ESCs by regulating transcription through different pathways in a HAT-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
B cell clones compete for entry into and dominance within germinal centers (GCs), where the highest-affinity B cell receptors (BCRs) are selected. However, diverse and low-affinity B cells can enter and reside in GCs for extended periods. To reconcile these observations, we hypothesize that a negative feedback loop may operate within B cells to preferentially restrain high-affinity clones from monopolizing the early GC niche. Here, we report a role for the nuclear receptor NUR77/Nr4a1 in this process. We show that NUR77 expression scales with antigen stimulation and restrains B cell expansion. Although NUR77 is dispensable for regulating GC size when GCs are elicited in a largely clonal manner, it serves to curb immunodominance under conditions where diverse clonal populations must compete for a constrained niche. We propose that this is important to preserve early clonal diversity in order to limit holes in the post-immune repertoire and to optimize GC selection.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic mutations in spliceosome genes are found in ∼50% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a myeloid malignancy associated with low blood counts. Expression of the mutant splicing factor U2AF1(S34F) alters hematopoiesis and mRNA splicing in mice. Our understanding of the functionally relevant alternatively spliced target genes that cause hematopoietic phenotypes in vivo remains incomplete. Here, we demonstrate that reduced expression of H2afy1.1, an alternatively spliced isoform of the histone H2A variant gene H2afy, is responsible for reduced B cells in U2AF1(S34F) mice. Deletion of H2afy or expression of U2AF1(S34F) reduces expression of Ebf1 (early B cell factor 1), a key transcription factor for B cell development, and mechanistically, H2AFY is enriched at the EBF1 promoter. Induced expression of H2AFY1.1 in U2AF1(S34F) cells rescues reduced EBF1 expression and B cells numbers in vivo. Collectively, our data implicate alternative splicing of H2AFY as a contributor to lymphopenia induced by U2AF1(S34F) in mice and MDS.

Abstract: Summary
Many anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibodies target the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site on viral spike receptor-binding domains (RBDs). Potent antibodies recognize exposed variable epitopes, often rendering them ineffective against other sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Class 4 anti-RBD antibodies against a less-exposed, but more-conserved, cryptic epitope could recognize newly emergent zoonotic sarbecoviruses and variants, but they usually show only weak neutralization potencies. Here, we characterize two class 4 anti-RBD antibodies derived from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) donors that exhibit breadth and potent neutralization of zoonotic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. C118-RBD and C022-RBD structures reveal orientations that extend from the cryptic epitope to occlude ACE2 binding and CDRH3-RBD main-chain H-bond interactions that extend an RBD β sheet, thus reducing sensitivity to RBD side-chain changes. A C118-spike trimer structure reveals rotated RBDs that allow access to the cryptic epitope and the potential for intra-spike crosslinking to increase avidity. These studies facilitate vaccine design and illustrate potential advantages of class 4 RBD-binding antibody therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Tactical disruption of protein synthesis is an attractive therapeutic strategy, with the first-in-class eIF4A-targeting compound zotatifin in clinical evaluation for cancer and COVID-19. The full cellular impact and mechanisms of these potent molecules are undefined at a proteomic level. Here, we report mass spectrometry analysis of translational reprogramming by rocaglates, cap-dependent initiation disruptors that include zotatifin. We find effects to be far more complex than simple “translational inhibition” as currently defined. Translatome analysis by TMT-pSILAC (tandem mass tag-pulse stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture mass spectrometry) reveals myriad upregulated proteins that drive hitherto unrecognized cytotoxic mechanisms, including GEF-H1-mediated anti-survival RHOA/JNK activation. Surprisingly, these responses are not replicated by eIF4A silencing, indicating a broader translational adaptation than currently understood. Translation machinery analysis by MATRIX (mass spectrometry analysis of active translation factors using ribosome density fractionation and isotopic labeling experiments) identifies rocaglate-specific dependence on specific translation factors including eEF1ε1 that drive translatome remodeling. Our proteome-level interrogation reveals that the complete cellular response to these historical “translation inhibitors” is mediated by comprehensive translational landscape remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that often presents with psychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is characterized by restricted, repetitive, and inflexible behaviors, which may result from abnormal activity in striatal circuits that mediate motor learning and action selection. To test whether altered striatal activity contributes to aberrant motor behaviors in the context of TSC, we conditionally deleted Tsc1 from direct or indirect pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs or iSPNs, respectively). We find that dSPN-specific loss of Tsc1 impairs endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD) at cortico-dSPN synapses and strongly enhances corticostriatal synaptic drive, which is not observed in iSPNs. dSPN-Tsc1 KO, but not iSPN-Tsc1 KO, mice show enhanced motor learning, a phenotype observed in several mouse models of ASD. These findings demonstrate that dSPNs are particularly sensitive to Tsc1 loss and suggest that enhanced corticostriatal activation may contribute to altered motor behaviors in TSC.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer, for which chemotherapy remains standard treatment and additional therapeutic targets are requisite. Here, we show that AML cells secrete the stem cell growth factor R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) to promote their self-renewal and prevent cell differentiation. Although RSPO2 is a well-known WNT agonist, we reveal that it maintains AML self-renewal WNT independently, by inhibiting BMP receptor signaling. Autocrine RSPO2 signaling is also required to prevent differentiation and to promote self-renewal in normal hematopoietic stem cells as well as primary AML cells. Comprehensive datamining reveals that RSPO2 expression is elevated in patients with AML of poor prognosis. Consistently, inhibiting RSPO2 prolongs survival in AML mouse xenograft models. Our study indicates that in AML, RSPO2 acts as an autocrine BMP antagonist to promote cancer cell renewal and may serve as a marker for poor prognosis.

Hippocampal place cells are thought to constitute a cognitive map of space derived from multimodal sensory inputs. Alteration of allocentric (visual) cues in a fixed environment is known to induce modulations of place cell activity to varying degrees from rate changes to global remapping. To determine how hippocampal ensembles combine multimodal sensory cues, we examine hippocampal CA1 remapping in Mongolian gerbils in a 1D virtual reality experiment, during which self-motion cues (locomotor, vestibular, and optic flow information) and allocentric visual cues are altered. We observe that self-motion cues are over-represented, but responsiveness to allocentric visual cues, although task-irrelevant, elicits both rate and global remapping in the hippocampal ensemble. We propose that remapping can be reconciled by considering global, partial, and rate remapping on a continuous scale on which the graded change of activity in the entire CA1 population can be interpreted as the expectancy about the animal’s spatial environment.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroinflammation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related mouse models has been recognized for decades, but the contribution of the recently described meningeal immune population to AD pathogenesis remains to be addressed. Here, using the 3xTg-AD model, we report an accumulation of interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing cells, mostly γδ T cells, in the brain and the meninges of female, but not male, mice, concomitant with the onset of cognitive decline. Critically, IL-17 neutralization into the ventricles is sufficient to prevent short-term memory and synaptic plasticity deficits at early stages of disease. These effects precede blood-brain barrier disruption and amyloid-beta or tau pathology, implying an early involvement of IL-17 in AD pathology. When IL-17 is neutralized at later stages of disease, the onset of short-memory deficits and amyloidosis-related splenomegaly is delayed. Altogether, our data support the idea that cognition relies on a finely regulated balance of “inflammatory” cytokines derived from the meningeal immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer therapy urges targeting of malignant subsets within self-renewing heterogeneous stem cell populations. We dissect the genetic and functional heterogeneity of human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) within patients by their innate responses to non-pathogenic mouse parvoviruses that are tightly restrained by cellular physiology. GSC neurospheres accumulate assembled capsids but restrict viral NS1 cytotoxic protein expression by an innate PKR/eIF2α-P response counteractable by electric pulses. NS1 triggers a comprehensive DNA damage response involving cell-cycle arrest, neurosphere disorganization, and bystander disruption of GSC-derived brain tumor architecture in rodent models. GSCs and cancer cell lines permissive to parvovirus genome replication require p53-Ser15 phosphorylation (Pp53S15). NS1 expression is enhanced by exogeneous Pp53S15 induction but repressed by wtp53. Consistently, patient-specific GSC subpopulations harboring p53 gain-of-function mutants and/or Pp53S15 are selective viral targets. This study provides a molecular foundation for personalized biosafe viral therapies against devastating glioblastoma and other cancers with deregulated p53 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Sleep is generally viewed as a period of recovery, but how the supply of cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes across sleep/wake states has remained unclear. Here, we directly observe red blood cells (RBCs) within capillaries, where the actual substance exchange between the blood and neurons/glia occurs, by two-photon microscopy. Across multiple cortical areas, average capillary CBF is largely increased during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas it does not differ between periods of active wakefulness and non-REM sleep. Capillary RBC flow during REM sleep is further elevated following REM sleep deprivation, suggesting that capillary CBF reflects REM sleep pressure. At the molecular level, signaling via adenosine A2a receptors is crucial; in A2a-KO mice, capillary CBF upsurge during REM sleep is dampened, and effects of REM sleep pressure are abolished. These results provide evidence regarding the dynamics of capillary CBF across sleep/wake states and insights to the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The peripheral nervous system responds to a wide variety of sensory stimuli, a process that requires great neuronal diversity. These diverse neurons are closely associated with glial cells originating from the neural crest. However, the molecular nature and diversity among peripheral glia are not understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile developing and mature glia from somatosensory dorsal root ganglia and auditory spiral ganglia. We found that glial precursors (GPs) in these two systems differ in their transcriptional profiles. Despite their unique features, somatosensory and auditory GPs undergo convergent differentiation to generate molecularly uniform myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells. By contrast, somatosensory and auditory satellite glial cells retain system-specific features. Lastly, we identified a glial signature gene set, providing new insights into commonalities among glia across the nervous system. This survey of gene expression in peripheral glia constitutes a resource for understanding functions of glia across different sensory modalities.

Abstract: As a pancreatic inflammatory marker, regenerating islet-derived protein 3A (Reg3A) plays a key role in inflammation-associated pancreatic carcinogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, and regulating cancer cell migration and invasion. This study aimed to reveal a novel immuno-regulatory mechanism by which Reg3A modulates tumour-promoting responses during pancreatic cancer (PC) progression. In an in vitro Transwell system that allowed the direct co-culture of human peripheral blood-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and Reg3A-overexpressing/ silenced human PC cells, PC cell-derived Reg3A was found to downregulate CD80, CD83 and CD86 expression on educated DCs, increase DC endocytic function, inhibit DC-induced T lymphocyte proliferation, reduce IL-12p70 production, and enhance IL-23 production by DCs. The positive effect of tumour-derived Reg3A-educated human DCs on PC progression was demonstrated in vivo by intraperitoneally transferring them into PC-implanted severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice reconstituted with human T cells. A Reg3A-JAK2/STAT3 positive feedback loop was identified in DCs educated with Reg3A. In conclusion, as a tumour-derived factor, Reg3A acted to block the differentiation and maturation of the most important antigen-presenting cells, DCs, causing them to limit their potential anti-tumour responses, thus facilitating PC escape and progression.

Abstract: Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is involved in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, yet its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we isolated mice hearts for a Langendorff perfusion test and used HL-1 myocytes for in vitro assessments. We first confirmed that TRPV4 agonist (GSK101) enhanced myocardial IR injury, as demonstrated by the reduced recovery of cardiac function, larger myocardial infarct size, and more apoptotic cells. We also found that GSK101 could further increase the phosphorylation of JNK and CaMKII in isolated hearts during IR. Notably, GSK101 dose-dependently evoked the phosphorylation of JNK and CaMKII in isolated normal hearts. All above GSK101-induced effects could be significantly blocked by the pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of TRPV4. More importantly, JNK inhibition (with SP600125) or CaMKII inhibition (with KN93 or in transgenic AC3-I mice) could prevent GSK101-induced myocardial injury during IR. In HL-1 myocytes, GSK101 triggered Ca2+ influx and evoked the phosphorylation of JNK and CaMKII but these effects were abolished by removing extracellular Ca2+ or in the presence of a TRPV4 antagonist. Finally, we showed that in HL-1 myocytes and isolated hearts during IR, JNK inhibition significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of CaMKII induced by GSK101 but CaMKII inhibition had no effect on JNK activation induced by GSK101. Our data suggest that TRPV4 activation exacerbates myocardial IR injury via the JNK-CaMKII phosphorylation pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Detailing how primate and mouse neurons differ is critical for creating generalized models of how neurons process information. We reconstruct 15,748 synapses in adult Rhesus macaques and mice and ask how connectivity differs on identified cell types in layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex. Primate excitatory and inhibitory neurons receive 2–5 times fewer excitatory and inhibitory synapses than similar mouse neurons. Primate excitatory neurons have lower excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) ratios than mouse but similar E/I ratios in inhibitory neurons. In both species, properties of inhibitory axons such as synapse size and frequency are unchanged, and inhibitory innervation of excitatory neurons is local and specific. Using artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) optimized for different cognitive tasks, we find that penalizing networks for creating and maintaining synapses, as opposed to neuronal firing, reduces the number of connections per node as the number of nodes increases, similar to primate neurons compared with mice.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR screens have accelerated the discovery of important cancer vulnerabilities. However, single-gene knockout phenotypes can be masked by redundancy among related genes. Paralogs constitute two-thirds of the human protein-coding genome, so existing methods are likely inadequate for assaying a large portion of gene function. Here, we develop paired guide RNAs for paralog genetic interaction mapping (pgPEN), a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 single- and double-knockout approach targeting more than 2,000 human paralogs. We apply pgPEN to two cell types and discover that 12% of human paralogs exhibit synthetic lethality in at least one context. We recover known synthetic lethal paralogs MEK1/MEK2, important drug targets CDK4/CDK6, and other synthetic lethal pairs including CCNL1/CCNL2. Additionally, we identify ten tumor suppressor paralog pairs whose compound loss promotes cell proliferation. These findings nominate drug targets and suggest that paralog genetic interactions could shape the landscape of positive and negative selection in cancer.

Abstract: Decellularization is a method that has been widely used in tissue engineering especially in the last 20 years. In this study decellularized rooster comb was prepared and characterized for using it as a tissue scaffold. Treatment of tissues with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100 as two decellularization procedures in different time points were compared according to different parameters such as cytocompatibility, cell removal, preservation of extracellular matrix (ECM), and mechanical properties to find the optimum technique. Even though there was no difference regarding to efficiency on cell removal, SDS demonstrated better results on protection of tissue morphology in comparison with Triton X-100. Therefore, in general the samples treated with SDS showed higher levels of mechanical properties and cytocompatibility in comparison with Triton X-100 applied tissues. In the cuisines of many countries, rooster comb is discarded as a waste material however, in this study it was demonstrated that decellularized rooster comb could be utilized as a cheap, easily obtainable, and biocompatible scaffold. In conclusion, it was revealed that decellularized rooster comb is a promising biomaterial for using as scaffold and it is expected to be utilized for the further studies in particular on skin tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
The kinase domain transfers phosphate from ATP to substrates. However, the Legionella effector SidJ adopts a kinase fold, yet catalyzes calmodulin (CaM)-dependent glutamylation to inactivate the SidE ubiquitin ligases. The structural and mechanistic basis in which the kinase domain catalyzes protein glutamylation is unknown. Here we present cryo-EM reconstructions of SidJ:CaM:SidE reaction intermediate complexes. We show that the kinase-like active site of SidJ adenylates an active-site Glu in SidE, resulting in the formation of a stable reaction intermediate complex. An insertion in the catalytic loop of the kinase domain positions the donor Glu near the acyl-adenylate for peptide bond formation. Our structural analysis led us to discover that the SidJ paralog SdjA is a glutamylase that differentially regulates the SidE ligases during Legionella infection. Our results uncover the structural and mechanistic basis in which the kinase fold catalyzes non-ribosomal amino acid ligations and reveal an unappreciated level of SidE-family regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acid starvation is sensed by Escherichia coli RelA and Bacillus subtilis Rel through monitoring the aminoacylation status of ribosomal A-site tRNA. These enzymes are positively regulated by their product—the alarmone nucleotide (p)ppGpp—through an unknown mechanism. The (p)ppGpp-synthetic activity of Rel/RelA is controlled via auto-inhibition by the hydrolase/pseudo-hydrolase (HD/pseudo-HD) domain within the enzymatic N-terminal domain region (NTD). We localize the allosteric pppGpp site to the interface between the SYNTH and pseudo-HD/HD domains, with the alarmone stimulating Rel/RelA by exploiting intra-NTD autoinhibition dynamics. We show that without stimulation by pppGpp, starved ribosomes cannot efficiently activate Rel/RelA. Compromised activation by pppGpp ablates Rel/RelA function in vivo, suggesting that regulation by the second messenger (p)ppGpp is necessary for mounting an acute starvation response via coordinated enzymatic activity of individual Rel/RelA molecules. Control by (p)ppGpp is lacking in the E. coli (p)ppGpp synthetase SpoT, thus explaining its weak synthetase activity.

Abstract: Summary
Virus-specific PD1+ Tcf1+ memory-like CD8+ T cells (TMLs) maintain the CD8+ T cell response during chronic viral infection. However, the fate of these cells following cessation of persistent antigen exposure has been unclear. Here, we find that TMLs persist upon transfer into antigen-free hosts and form memory following recall stimulation. Phenotypic, functional, and transcriptome analyses show that TML-derived memory cells resemble those arising in response to acute, resolved infection, but they retain features of chronically stimulated cells, including elevated PD-1 and Tox and reduced cytokine expression. This chronic infection imprint is largely accounted for by constitutive Tox expression. Virus-specific Tcf1+ CD8+ T cells that persist after clearance of systemic infection also display a chronic infection imprint. Notwithstanding, renewed virus exposure induces a recall response, which controls virus infection in part. Thus, cessation of chronic antigen exposure yields a memory CD8+ T cell compartment that reflects prior stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
Agonists for glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) are currently used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Their benefits have been centered on pancreas and hypothalamus, but their roles in other organ systems are not well understood. We studied the action of GLP-1R on secretions of adrenal medulla. Exendin-4, a synthetic analog of GLP-1, increases the synthesis and the release of catecholamines (CAs) by increasing cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, without apparent participation of cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Epac). Exendin-4, when incubated for 24 h, increases CA synthesis by promoting the activation of tyrosine hydroxylase. Short incubation (20 min) increases the quantum size of exocytotic events by switching exocytosis from partial to full fusion. Our results give a strong support to the role of GLP-1 in the fine control of exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Compact and versatile CRISPR-Cas systems will enable genome engineering applications through high-efficiency delivery in a wide variety of contexts. Here, we create an efficient miniature Cas system (CasMINI) engineered from the type V-F Cas12f (Cas14) system by guide RNA and protein engineering, which is less than half the size of currently used CRISPR systems (Cas9 or Cas12a). We demonstrate that CasMINI can drive high levels of gene activation (up to thousands-fold increases), while the natural Cas12f system fails to function in mammalian cells. We show that the CasMINI system has comparable activities to Cas12a for gene activation, is highly specific, and allows robust base editing and gene editing. We expect that CasMINI can be broadly useful for cell engineering and gene therapy applications ex vivo and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acids are essential building blocks of life. However, increasing evidence suggests that elevated amino acids cause cellular toxicity associated with numerous metabolic disorders. How cells cope with elevated amino acids remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a previously identified cellular structure, the mitochondrial-derived compartment (MDC), functions to protect cells from amino acid stress. In response to amino acid elevation, MDCs are generated from mitochondria, where they selectively sequester and deplete SLC25A nutrient carriers and their associated import receptor Tom70 from the organelle. Generation of MDCs promotes amino acid catabolism, and their formation occurs simultaneously with transporter removal at the plasma membrane via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. The combined loss of vacuolar amino acid storage, MVBs, and MDCs renders cells sensitive to high amino acid stress. Thus, we propose that MDCs operate as part of a coordinated cell network that facilitates amino acid homeostasis through post-translational nutrient transporter remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
B cell tolerance prevents autoimmunity by deleting or deactivating autoreactive B cells that otherwise may cause autoantibody-driven disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). Lupus is characterized by immunoglobulin Gs carrying a double-stranded (ds)-DNA autospecificity derived mainly from somatic hypermutation in the germinal center (GC), pointing to a checkpoint breach of GC B cell tolerance that leads to lupus. However, tolerance mechanisms in the GC remain poorly understood. Here, we show that upregulated sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) in anti-dsDNA GC B cells induces apoptosis by directly activating protein kinase C δ (PKCδ)’s pro-apoptotic activity. This tolerance mechanism prevents lupus autoimmunity in C57/BL6 mice and can be stimulated pharmacologically to inhibit lupus pathogenesis in lupus-prone NZBWF1 mice. Patients with lupus consistently have substantially reduced SMS2 expression in B cells and to an even greater extent in autoimmune-prone, age-associated B cells, suggesting that patients with lupus have insufficient SMS2-regulated B cell tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) and intratumoral heterogeneity represent major challenges in glioblastoma therapy. Here, we report that the LGALS1 gene, encoding the carbohydrate binding protein, galectin1, is a key regulator of BTSCs and glioblastoma resistance to therapy. Genetic deletion of LGALS1 alters BTSC gene expression profiles and results in downregulation of gene sets associated with the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we establish that inhibition of LGALS1 signaling in BTSCs impairs self-renewal, suppresses tumorigenesis, prolongs lifespan, and improves glioblastoma response to ionizing radiation in preclinical animal models. Mechanistically, we show that LGALS1 is a direct transcriptional target of STAT3 with its expression robustly regulated by the ligand OSM. Importantly, we establish that galectin1 forms a complex with the transcription factor HOXA5 to reprogram the BTSC transcriptional landscape. Our data unravel an oncogenic signaling pathway by which the galectin1/HOXA5 complex maintains BTSCs and promotes glioblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionary strategy of transferring maternal antibodies via milk profoundly impacts the survival, lifelong health, and wellbeing of all neonates, including a pronounced impact on human breastfeeding success and infant development. While there has been increased recognition that interorgan connectivity influences the quality of a mother’s milk, potentially to personalize it for her offspring, the underlying bases for these processes are incompletely resolved. Here, we define an essential role of Peyer’s patches (PPs) for the generation of plasma cells that secrete maternal immunoglobulin A (IgA) into milk. Our metagenomic analysis reveals that the presence of certain residential microorganisms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as Bacteroides acidifaciens and Prevotella buccalis, is indispensable for the programming of maternal IgA synthesis prior to lactational transfer. Our data provide important insights into how the microbiome of the maternal GI environment, specifically through PPs, can be communicated to the next generation via milk.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiation of intestinal T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which contribute to mucosal barrier protection from invasive pathogens, is dependent on colonization with distinct commensal bacteria. Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are sufficient to support Th17 cell differentiation in mouse, but the molecular and cellular requirements for this process remain incompletely characterized. Here, we show that intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), not intestine proper, are the dominant site of SFB-induced intestinal Th17 cell differentiation. Subsequent migration of these cells to the intestinal lamina propria is dependent on their upregulation of integrin β7. Stat3-dependent induction of RORγt, the Th17 cell-specifying transcription factor, largely depends on IL-6, but signaling through the receptors for IL-21 and IL-23 can compensate for absence of IL-6 to promote SFB-directed Th17 cell differentiation. These results indicate that redundant cytokine signals guide commensal microbe-dependent Th17 cell differentiation in the MLNs and accumulation of the cells in the lamina propria.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing plays an important role in brain development, but its global contribution to human neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs) requires further investigation. Here we examine the relationships between splicing isoform expression in the brain and de novo loss-of-function mutations from individuals with NDDs. We analyze the full-length isoform transcriptome of the developing human brain and observe differentially expressed isoforms and isoform co-expression modules undetectable by gene-level analyses. These isoforms are enriched in loss-of-function mutations and microexons, are co-expressed with a unique set of partners, and have higher prenatal expression. We experimentally test the effect of splice-site mutations and demonstrate exon skipping in five NDD risk genes, including SCN2A, DYRK1A, and BTRC. Our results suggest that the splice site mutation in BTRC reduces translational efficiency, likely affecting Wnt signaling through impaired degradation of β-catenin. We propose that functional effects of mutations should be investigated at the isoform- rather than gene-level resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Drugs targeting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) have been approved to treat major depressive disorder (MDD); however, the presence of undesirable psychotomimetic and cognitive side effects may limit their utility. In this study, we show that the phosphorylation levels of the GluN2B subunit at tyrosine (Y) 1070 increase in mice after both acute and chronic restraint stress (CRS) exposure. Preventing GluN2B-Y1070 phosphorylation via Y1070F mutation knockin produces effects similar to those of antidepressants but does not affect cognitive or anxiety-related behaviors in subject mice. Mechanistically, the Y1070F mutation selectively reduces non-synaptic NMDAR currents and increases the number of excitatory synapses in the layer 5 pyramidal neurons of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) but not in the hippocampus. Altogether, our study identifies phosphorylation levels of GluN2B-Y1070 in the mPFC as a dynamic, master switch guarding depressive behaviors, suggesting that disrupting the Y1070 phosphorylation of GluN2B subunit has the potential for developing new antidepressants.

Abstract: The effects of anti-inflammatory drug gossypol on osteoarthritis (OA) treatment were discussed in this paper. After identified using toluidine blue and immunofluorescence staining of type II collagen, chondrocytes from OA patients were treated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β), gossypol, and overexpressed connexin43 (CX43). In treated chondrocytes, according to MTT assay and flow cytometry, gossypol increased viability and reduced apoptosis of IL-1β induced chondrocytes. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suggested that gossypol downregulated inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot confirmed that gossypol downregulated CX43, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65, TNF-α, toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expressions. Besides, overexpressed CX43 reversed the effects of gossypol on viability, apoptosis, and expressions of factors related to TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway of IL-1β-induced chondrocytes. In conclusion, gossypol ameliorates IL-1β-induced apoptosis and inflammation in chondrocytes by suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway via downregulating CX43.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 consensus sequence coordinates key events during transcription, and its deregulation leads to defects in transcription and RNA processing. Here, we report that the histone deacetylase activity of the fission yeast Hos2/Set3 complex plays an important role in suppressing cryptic initiation of antisense transcription when RNA polymerase II phosphorylation is dysregulated due to the loss of Ssu72 phosphatase. Interestingly, although single Hos2 and Set3 mutants have little effect, loss of Hos2 or Set3 combined with ssu72Δ results in a synergistic increase in antisense transcription globally and correlates with elevated sensitivity to genotoxic agents. We demonstrate a key role for the Ssu72/Hos2/Set3 mechanism in the suppression of cryptic antisense transcription at the 3′ end of convergent genes that are most susceptible to these defects, ensuring the fidelity of gene expression within dense genomes of simple eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulation of oncogenic signals in cancer triggers replication stress. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are rapidly and transiently expressed following stressful signals, contributing to an integrated response. Here, we find that the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 localizes across the gene body and 3′ UTR of IEGs, where it inhibits transcriptional elongation by RNA Pol II, generating R-loops and accessible chromatin domains. Acute replication stress causes immediate dissociation of NR4A1 and a burst of transcriptionally poised IEG expression. Ectopic expression of NR4A1 enhances tumorigenesis by breast cancer cells, while its deletion leads to massive chromosomal instability and proliferative failure, driven by deregulated expression of its IEG target, FOS. Approximately half of breast and other primary cancers exhibit accessible chromatin domains at IEG gene bodies, consistent with this stress-regulatory pathway. Cancers that have retained this mechanism in adapting to oncogenic replication stress may be dependent on NR4A1 for their proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
DDX3X is a ubiquitously expressed RNA helicase involved in multiple stages of RNA biogenesis. DDX3X is frequently mutated in Burkitt lymphoma, but the functional basis for this is unknown. Here, we show that loss-of-function DDX3X mutations are also enriched in MYC-translocated diffuse large B cell lymphoma and reveal functional cooperation between mutant DDX3X and MYC. DDX3X promotes the translation of mRNA encoding components of the core translational machinery, thereby driving global protein synthesis. Loss-of-function DDX3X mutations moderate MYC-driven global protein synthesis, thereby buffering MYC-induced proteotoxic stress during early lymphomagenesis. Established lymphoma cells restore full protein synthetic capacity by aberrant expression of DDX3Y, a Y chromosome homolog, the expression of which is normally restricted to the testis. These findings show that DDX3X loss of function can buffer MYC-driven proteotoxic stress and highlight the capacity of male B cell lymphomas to then compensate for this loss by ectopic DDX3Y expression.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cells use diverse pathways to prevent deleterious consequences during DNA replication, yet the mechanism by which cells survey individual replisomes to detect spontaneous replication impediments at the basal level, and their accumulation during replication stress, remain undefined. Here, we used single-molecule localization microscopy coupled with high-order-correlation image-mining algorithms to quantify the composition of individual replisomes in single cells during unperturbed replication and under replicative stress. We identified a basal-level activity of ATR that monitors and regulates the amounts of RPA at forks during normal replication. Replication-stress amplifies the basal activity through the increased volume of ATR-RPA interaction and diffusion-driven enrichment of ATR at forks. This localized crowding of ATR enhances its collision probability, stimulating the activation of its replication-stress response. Finally, we provide a computational model describing how the basal activity of ATR is amplified to produce its canonical replication stress response.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes undergo intense energetic stress in obesity resulting in loss of mitochondrial mass and function. We have found that adipocytes respond to mitochondrial stress by rapidly and robustly releasing small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). These sEVs contain respiration-competent, but oxidatively damaged mitochondrial particles, which enter circulation and are taken up by cardiomyocytes, where they trigger a burst of ROS. The result is compensatory antioxidant signaling in the heart that protects cardiomyocytes from acute oxidative stress, consistent with a preconditioning paradigm. As such, a single injection of sEVs from energetically stressed adipocytes limits cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice. This study provides the first description of functional mitochondrial transfer between tissues and the first vertebrate example of “inter-organ mitohormesis.” Thus, these seemingly toxic adipocyte sEVs may provide a physiological avenue of potent cardio-protection against the inevitable lipotoxic or ischemic stresses elicited by obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the critical regulatory function of promoter-proximal pausing, the influence of pausing kinetics on transcriptional control remains an active area of investigation. Here, we present Start-TimeLapse-seq (STL-seq), a method that captures the genome-wide kinetics of short, capped RNA turnover and reveals principles of regulation at the pause site. By measuring the rates of release into elongation and premature termination through the inhibition of pause release, we determine that pause-release rates are highly variable, and most promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II molecules prematurely terminate (∼80%). The preferred regulatory mechanism upon a hormonal stimulus (20-hydroxyecdysone) is to influence pause-release rather than termination rates. Transcriptional shutdown occurs concurrently with the induction of promoter-proximal termination under hyperosmotic stress, but paused transcripts from TATA box-containing promoters remain stable, demonstrating an important role for cis-acting DNA elements in pausing. STL-seq dissects the kinetics of pause release and termination, providing an opportunity to identify mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Polyploidy frequently arises in response to injury, aging, and disease. Despite its prevalence, major gaps exist in our understanding of how polyploid cells alter tissue function. In the adult Drosophila epithelium, wound healing is dependent on the generation of multinucleated polyploid cells resulting in a permanent change in the epithelial architecture. Here, we study how the wound-induced polyploid cells affect tissue function by altering epithelial mechanics. The mechanosensor nonmuscle myosin II is activated and upregulated in wound-induced polyploid cells and persists after healing completes. Polyploidy enhances relative epithelial tension, which is dependent on the endocycle and not cell fusion post injury. Remarkably, the enhanced epithelial tension mimics the relative tension of the lateral muscle fibers, which are permanently severed by the injury. As a result, we found that the wound-induced polyploid cells remodel the epithelium to maintain fly abdominal movements, which may help compensate for lost tissue tension.

Abstract: Andrographis paniculata has been shown to be associated with male reproductive dysfunction, although the available data are scarce and inconsistent, and the associated mechanisms are elusive. Hormonal mechanism via hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, and non-hormonal mechanism primarily through oxidative stress, are involved in the modulation of male reproductive function. We therefore, hypothesized that suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis and/or oxidative stress is involved in Andrographis paniculata-induced reproductive dysfunction. Male Wistar rats received either vehicle or Andrographis paniculata in varying doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body weight daily for 8 weeks. Treatment with Andrographis paniculata led to reduced sperm count, motility, and viability. Andrographis paniculata treatment also resulted in distorted spermatogenesis and reduced serum testosterone. On the other hand, Andrographis paniculata led to reduction in the testicular content of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL-6, and testicular activities of xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase, but raised testicular levels of reduced glutathione content and enhanced activity of super oxide dismutase. However, body weight gain, and absolute and relative reproductive organ weights were similar across all the groups. These findings demonstrate that Andrographis paniculata induces reproductive toxicity via suppression of testosterone and not induction of oxidative stress. Therefore, Andrographis paniculata could be a potential and safe male contraceptive.

Abstract: Summary
Various types of sensory stimuli have been shown to induce Ca2+ elevations in glia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the signaling pathways mediating sensory-evoked activity in glia in intact animals is still emerging. During early development of the Xenopus laevis visual system, radial astrocytes in the optic tectum are highly responsive to sensory stimulation. Ca2+ transients occur spontaneously in radial astrocytes at rest and are abolished by silencing neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin. Visual stimulation drives temporally correlated increases in the activity patterns of neighboring radial astrocytes. Following blockade of all glutamate receptors (gluRs), visually evoked Ca2+ activity in radial astrocytes persists, while neuronal activity is suppressed. The additional blockade of either glu transporters or sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX) abolishes visually evoked responses in glia. Finally, we demonstrate that blockade of NCX alone is sufficient to prevent visually evoked responses in radial astrocytes, highlighting a pivotal role for NCX in glia during development.

Abstract: Summary
During navigation, animals estimate their position using path integration and landmarks, engaging many brain areas. Whether these areas follow specialized or universal cue integration principles remains incompletely understood. We combine electrophysiology with virtual reality to quantify cue integration across thousands of neurons in three navigation-relevant areas: primary visual cortex (V1), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Compared with V1 and RSC, path integration influences position estimates more in MEC, and conflicts between path integration and landmarks trigger remapping more readily. Whereas MEC codes position prospectively, V1 codes position retrospectively, and RSC is intermediate between the two. Lowered visual contrast increases the influence of path integration on position estimates only in MEC. These properties are most pronounced in a population of MEC neurons, overlapping with grid cells, tuned to distance run in darkness. These results demonstrate the specialized role that path integration plays in MEC compared with other navigation-relevant cortical areas.

Abstract: Summary
Adult mammalian tissues such as heart, brain, retina, and the sensory structures of the inner ear do not effectively regenerate, although a latent capacity for regeneration exists at embryonic and perinatal times. We explored the epigenetic basis for this latent regenerative potential in the mouse inner ear and its rapid loss during maturation. In perinatal supporting cells, whose fate is maintained by Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, the hair cell enhancer network is epigenetically primed (H3K4me1) but silenced (active H3K27 de-acetylation and trimethylation). Blocking Notch signaling during the perinatal period of plasticity rapidly eliminates epigenetic silencing and allows supporting cells to transdifferentiate into hair cells. Importantly, H3K4me1 priming of the hair cell enhancers in supporting cells is removed during the first post-natal week, coinciding with the loss of transdifferentiation potential. We hypothesize that enhancer decommissioning during cochlear maturation contributes to the failure of hair cell regeneration in the mature organ of Corti.

Abstract: Summary
Replication timing (RT) associates with genome architecture, while having a mixed relationship to histone marks. By profiling replication at high resolution and assessing broad histone marks across the cell cycle at the resolution of RT with and without genetic perturbation, we address the causal relationship between histone marks and RT. Four primary chromatin states, including an uncharacterized H3K36me2 state, emerge and define 97% of the mappable genome. RT and local replication patterns (e.g., initiation zones) quantitatively associate with chromatin states, histone mark dynamics, and spatial chromatin structure. Manipulation of broad histone marks and enhancer elements by overexpressing the histone H3 lysine 9/36 tri-demethylase KDM4A impacts RT across 11% of the genome. Broad histone modification changes were strong predictors of the observed RT alterations. Lastly, replication within H3K36me2-enriched neighborhoods is sensitive to KDM4A overexpression and is controlled at a megabase scale.

Abstract: Summary
Psychological stress (PS) is associated with systemic inflammation and accelerates inflammatory disease progression (e.g., atherosclerosis). The mechanisms underlying stress-mediated inflammation and future health risk are poorly understood. Monocytes are key in sustaining systemic inflammation, and recent studies demonstrate that they maintain the memory of inflammatory insults, leading to a heightened inflammatory response upon rechallenge. We show that PS induces remodeling of the chromatin landscape and transcriptomic reprogramming of monocytes, skewing them to a primed hyperinflammatory phenotype. Monocytes from stressed mice and humans exhibit a characteristic inflammatory transcriptomic signature and are hyperresponsive upon stimulation with Toll-like receptor ligands. RNA and ATAC sequencing reveal that monocytes from stressed mice and humans exhibit activation of metabolic pathways (mTOR and PI3K) and reduced chromatin accessibility at mitochondrial respiration-associated loci. Collectively, our findings suggest that PS primes the reprogramming of myeloid cells to a hyperresponsive inflammatory state, which may explain how PS confers inflammatory disease risk.

Abstract: Summary
Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) can promote metabolic endotoxemia, which is considered inflammatory and metabolically detrimental based on Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 agonists, such as Escherichia coli-derived LPS. LPSs from certain bacteria antagonize TLR4 yet contribute to endotoxemia measured by endotoxin units (EUs). We found that E. coli LPS impairs gut barrier function and worsens glycemic control in mice, but equal doses of LPSs from other bacteria do not. Matching the LPS dose from R. sphaeroides and E. coli by EUs reveals that only E. coli LPS promotes dysglycemia and adipose inflammation, delays intestinal glucose absorption, and augments insulin and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 secretion. Metabolically beneficial endotoxemia promoted by R. sphaeroides LPS counteracts dysglycemia caused by an equal dose of E. coli LPS and improves glucose control in obese mice. The concept of metabolic endotoxemia should be expanded beyond LPS load to include LPS characteristics, such as lipid A acylation, which dictates the effect of metabolic endotoxemia.

Abstract: Summary
The relationship between poor in vivo bioavailability and effective pharmacological activity are not yet fully clarified for many flavonoids. The analysis of flavonoids-induced alterations in the gut microbiota represents a promising approach to provide useful clues to elucidate the mechanism of action. Here, we investigate the effect of myricetin supplementation on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats and explore the associations with the gut microbiota through high-throughput analyses. The 12-week myricetin supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation outcomes suggest that myricetin significantly slows the development of NAFLD. Meanwhile, the anti-NAFLD effects of myricetin are associated with the modulation of the gut microbiota composition. Myricetin reduces hepatic lipid synthesis and inflammation through modulations in fecal butyric-acid-related gut microbiota and protection of the gut barrier function. This study may facilitate the elucidation of the action mechanism of flavonoids with low bioavailability.

Abstract: The 25-century long history of brain science can be divided into four distinct 'Eras': Era 1 (∼2000 years) started around 500 BC with reductionist studies of human and animal brains using invasive in vivo and ex vivo methods; Era 2 (∼200 years) started in the 17th century and introduced the first invasive methods to study the function of living tissues; Era 3 started around 1838 and is the ongoing era of cellular neurophysiology; finally, Era 4 (in statu nascendi) is the era of non-invasive, holistic yet mechanistic, studies of the brain. Animal experimentation is becoming increasingly more holistic as multimodal imaging and recording techniques are combined in a single experiment on the brain of awake behaving animal. This newly emerged approach can be called in vigilo (from Latin 'in awake' or 'in vigilant state'), by analogy to the earlier introduced terms in vivo or in vitro. We introduce the Special Issue "In Vigilo Veritas: New Frontiers of Optical Imaging and Electrical Recording in the Brain of Awake Behaving Mice", which features original research articles and reviews that represent some of the finest examples of a truly multimodal studies, where behavioural readouts and tasks are combined in the same longitudinal experiment and on the same mouse with the two-photon imaging, optogenetics and/or electrophysiological recordings. This exciting multi-methodological approach creates a fertile ground for breakthrough discoveries in neurophysiology and neuropsychology of an awake behaving mammalian brain.

Abstract: Summary
During acute malaria, most individuals mount robust inflammatory responses that limit parasite burden. However, long-lived sterilizing anti-malarial memory responses are not efficiently induced, even following repeated Plasmodium exposures. Using multiple Plasmodium species, genetically modified parasites, and combinations of host genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we find that the deposition of the malarial pigment hemozoin directly limits the abundance and capacity of conventional type 1 dendritic cells to prime helper T cell responses. Hemozoin-induced dendritic cell dysfunction results in aberrant Plasmodium-specific CD4 T follicular helper cell differentiation, which constrains memory B cell and long-lived plasma cell formation. Mechanistically, we identify that dendritic cell-intrinsic NLRP3 inflammasome activation reduces conventional type 1 dendritic cell abundance, phagocytosis, and T cell priming functions in vivo. These data identify biological consequences of hemozoin deposition during malaria and highlight the capacity of the malarial pigment to program immune evasion during the earliest events following an initial Plasmodium exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) excitability regulates anxiety. In the DG, glutamatergic mossy cells (MCs) receive the excitatory drive from principal granule cells (GCs) and mediate the feedback excitation and inhibition of GCs. However, the circuit mechanism by which MCs regulate anxiety-related information routing through hippocampal circuits remains unclear. Moreover, the correlation between MC activity and anxiety states is unclear. In this study, we first demonstrate, by means of calcium fiber photometry, that MC activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) of mice increases while they explore anxiogenic environments. Next, juxtacellular recordings reveal that optogenetic activation of MCs preferentially recruits GABAergic neurons, thereby suppressing GCs and ventral CA1 neurons. Finally, chemogenetic excitation of MCs in the vHPC reduces avoidance behaviors in both healthy and anxious mice. These results not only indicate an anxiolytic role of MCs but also suggest that MCs may be a potential therapeutic target for anxiety disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-clearing methods allow every cell in the mouse brain to be imaged without physical sectioning. However, the computational tools currently available for cell quantification in cleared tissue images have been limited to counting sparse cell populations in stereotypical mice. Here, we introduce NuMorph, a group of analysis tools to quantify all nuclei and nuclear markers within the mouse cortex after clearing and imaging by light-sheet microscopy. We apply NuMorph to investigate two distinct mouse models: a Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) model with severe neurodegenerative deficits and a Neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) model with a more subtle brain overgrowth phenotype. In each case, we identify differential effects of gene deletion on individual cell-type counts and distribution across cortical regions that manifest as alterations of gross brain morphology. These results underline the value of whole-brain imaging approaches, and the tools are widely applicable for studying brain structure phenotypes at cellular resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian preimplantation embryos follow a stereotypic pattern of development from zygotes to blastocysts. Here, we use labeled nutrient isotopologue analysis of small numbers of embryos to track downstream metabolites. Combined with transcriptomic analysis, we assess the capacity of the embryo to reprogram its metabolism through development. Early embryonic metabolism is rigid in its nutrient requirements, sensitive to reductive stress and has a marked disequilibrium between two halves of the TCA cycle. Later, loss of maternal LDHB and transcription of zygotic products favors increased activity of bioenergetic shuttles, fatty-acid oxidation and equilibration of the TCA cycle. As metabolic plasticity peaks, blastocysts can develop without external nutrients. Normal developmental metabolism of the early embryo is distinct from cancer metabolism. However, similarities emerge upon reductive stress. Increased metabolic plasticity with maturation is due to changes in redox control mechanisms and to transcriptional reprogramming of later-stage embryos during homeostasis or upon adaptation to environmental changes.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) engraftment after transplantation during anticancer treatment depends on support from the recipient bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Here, by studying physiological homing of fetal HSPCs, we show the critical requirement of balanced local crosstalk within the skeletal niche for successful HSPC settlement in BM. Transgene-induced overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by osteoprogenitor cells elicits stromal and endothelial hyperactivation, profoundly impacting the stromal-vessel interface and vascular architecture. Concomitantly, HSPC homing and survival are drastically impaired. Transcriptome profiling, flow cytometry, and high-resolution imaging indicate alterations in perivascular and endothelial cell characteristics, vascular function and cellular metabolism, associated with increased oxidative stress within the VEGF-enriched BM environment. Thus, developmental HSPC homing to bone is controlled by local stromal-vascular integrity and the oxidative-metabolic status of the recipient milieu. Interestingly, irradiation of adult mice also induces stromal VEGF expression and similar osteo-angiogenic niche changes, underscoring that our findings may contribute targets for improving stem cell therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The distribution, dynamics, and function of RNA structures in human development are under-explored. Here, we systematically assayed RNA structural dynamics and their relationship with gene expression, translation, and decay during human neurogenesis. We observed that the human ESC transcriptome is globally more structurally accessible than differentiated cells and undergoes extensive RNA structure changes, particularly in the 3′ UTR. Additionally, RNA structure changes during differentiation are associated with translation and decay. We observed that RBP and miRNA binding is associated with RNA structural changes during early neuronal differentiation, and splicing is associated during later neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that RBPs are major factors in structure remodeling and co-regulate additional RBPs and miRNAs through structure. We demonstrated an example of this by showing that PUM2-induced structure changes on LIN28A enable miR-30 binding. This study deepens our understanding of the widespread and complex role of RNA-based gene regulation during human development.

Abstract: Summary
Rationally sequencing and combining PD-1/L1-and MAPK-targeted therapies may overcome innate and acquired resistance. Since increased clinical benefit of MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi) is associated with previous immune checkpoint therapy, we compare the efficacies of sequential and/or combinatorial regimens in subcutaneous murine models of melanoma driven by BrafV600, Nras, or Nf1 mutations as well as colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma driven by KrasG12C. Anti-PD-1/L1 lead-in preceding MAPKi combination optimizes response durability by promoting pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages and clonal expansion of interferon-γhi, and CD8+ cytotoxic and proliferative (versus CD4+ regulatory) T cells that highly express activation genes. Since therapeutic resistance of melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) limits patient survival, we demonstrate that sequencing anti-PD-1/L1 therapy before MAPKi combination suppresses MBM and improves mouse survival with robust T cell clonal expansion in both intracranial and extracranial metastatic sites. We propose clinically testing brief anti-PD-1/L1 (± anti-CTLA-4) dosing before MAPKi co-treatment to suppress therapeutic resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidative stress is a ubiquitous cellular challenge implicated in aging, neurodegeneration, and cancer. By studying pathogenic mutations in the tumor suppressor BRCA2, we identify a general mechanism by which oxidative stress restricts mitochondrial (mt)DNA replication. BRCA2 inactivation induces R-loop accumulation in the mtDNA regulatory region and diminishes mtDNA replication initiation. In BRCA2-deficient cells, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated, and ROS scavengers suppress the mtDNA defects. Conversely, wild-type cells exposed to oxidative stress by pharmacologic or genetic manipulation phenocopy these defects. Mechanistically, we find that 8-oxoguanine accumulation in mtDNA caused by oxidative stress suffices to impair recruitment of the mitochondrial enzyme RNaseH1 to sites of R-loop accrual, restricting mtDNA replication initiation. Thus, oxidative stress impairs RNaseH1 function to cripple mtDNA maintenance. Our findings highlight a molecular mechanism that links oxidative stress to mitochondrial dysfunction and is elicited by the inactivation of genes implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer.

Abstract: Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is triggered by assembly of Orai1 with STIM proteins in ER-PM junctions. Plasma membrane PIP2 as well as PIP2-binding protein, SEPT4, significantly impact Orai1-STIM1 interaction. While septins and PIP2 can organize the actin cytoskeleton, it is unclear whether the status of actin within the junctions contributes to SOCE. We report herein that actin remodeling modulates STIM1 clustering. Our findings show that a PIP2- and SEPT4-dependent mechanism involving CDC42, WASP/WAVE, and ARP2 regulates actin remodeling into a ring-like structure around STIM1 puncta. CDC42 localization in the ER-plasma membrane region is enhanced following ER-Ca2+ store depletion. PIP2 depletion or knockdown of SEPT4 attenuate the recruitment of CDC42 to the ER-PM region. Importantly, knockdown of SEPT4, or CDC42+ARP2, disrupts the organization of actin as well as STIM1 clustering. Consequently, Orai1 recruitment to STIM1 puncta, SOCE, and NFAT translocation to the nucleus are all attenuated. Ca2+ influx induced by STIM1-C terminus is not affected by CDC42 knockdown. In aggregate, our findings reveal that PIP2 and SEPT4 affect Orai1/STIM1 clustering by coordinating actin remodeling within ER-PM junctions. This dynamic reorganization of actin has an important role in regulation of SOCE and downstream Ca2+-dependent effector functions.

Abstract: Both mechanical and biochemical stimulation are required for maintaining the integrity of articular cartilage. However, chondrocytes respond differently to mechanical stimuli in osteoarthritic cartilage when biochemical signaling pathways, such as Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), are altered. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is central to chondrocyte mechanotransduction and regulation of cartilage homeostasis. Here, we propose that changes in IGF-1 can modulate TRPV4 channel activity. We demonstrate that physiologic levels of IGF-1 suppress hypotonic-induced TRPV4 currents and intracellular calcium flux by increasing apparent cell stiffness that correlates with actin stress fiber formation. Disruption of F-actin following IGF-1 treatment results in the return of the intracellular calcium response to hypotonic swelling. Using point mutations of the TRPV4 channel at the microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP-7) site shows that regulation of TRPV4 by actin is mediated via the interaction of actin with the MAP-7 domain of TRPV4. We further highlight that ATP release, a down-stream response to mechanical stimulation in chondrocytes, is mediated by TRPV4 during hypotonic challenge. This response is significantly abrogated with IGF-1 treatment. As chondrocyte mechanosensitivity is greatly altered during osteoarthritis progression, IGF-1 presents as a promising candidate for prevention and treatment of articular cartilage damage.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic scaling is an extensively studied form of homeostatic plasticity critically involved in various brain functions. Although it is accepted that synaptic scaling is expressed through the postsynaptic accumulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), the induction mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we show that TTX treatment induces rapid but transient release of the neurite growth-promoting factor 2 (NGPF2), and this release is necessary and sufficient for TTX-induced scaling up. In addition, we show that inhibition of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-LIMK-cofilin signaling pathway blocks TTX- and NGPF2-induced synaptic scaling up. Furthermore, we show that TTX-induced release of NGPF2 is protein synthesis dependent and requires fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMRP1). These results indicate that activity blockade induces NGPF2 synthesis and release to trigger synaptic scaling up through LIMK-cofilin-dependent actin reorganization, spine enlargement, and stabilization of AMPARs at the synapse.

Abstract: Summary
The recent characterization of RNA-targeting CRISPR nucleases has enabled diverse transcriptome engineering and screening applications that depend crucially on prediction and selection of optimized CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs). Previously, we developed a computational model to predict RfxCas13d gRNA activity for all human protein-coding genes. Here, we extend this framework to six model organisms (human, mouse, zebrafish, fly, nematode, and flowering plants) for protein-coding genes and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and also to four RNA virus families (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], HIV-1, H1N1 influenza, and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). We include experimental validation of predictions by testing knockdown of multiple ncRNAs (MALAT1, HOTAIRM1, Gas5, and Pvt1) in human and mouse cells. We developed a freely available web-based platform (cas13design) with pre-scored gRNAs for transcriptome-wide targeting in several organisms and an interactive design tool to predict optimal gRNAs for custom RNA targets entered by the user. This resource will facilitate CRISPR-Cas13 RNA targeting in model organisms, emerging viral threats to human health.
