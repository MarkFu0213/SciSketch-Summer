Abstract: Summary
Increased hepatic glucose production (HGP) contributes to hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Hormonal regulation of this process is primarily, but not exclusively, mediated by the AKT-FoxO1 pathway. Here, we show that cAMP and dexamethasone regulate the high-mobility group superfamily member TOX4 to mediate HGP, independent of the insulin receptor/FoxO1 pathway. TOX4 inhibition decreases glucose production in primary hepatocytes and liver and increases glucose tolerance. Combined genetic ablation of TOX4 and FoxO1 in liver has additive effects on glucose tolerance and gluconeogenesis. Moreover, TOX4 ablation fails to reverse the metabolic derangement brought by insulin receptor knockout. TOX4 expression is increased in livers of patients with steatosis and diabetes and in diet-induced obese and db/db mice. In the latter two murine models, knockdown Tox4 decreases glycemia and improves glucose tolerance. We conclude that TOX4 is an insulin receptor-independent regulator of HGP and a candidate contributor to the pathophysiology of diabetes.

Abstract: Mutations in either of the polycystic kidney disease genes, PKD1 or PKD2, engender the growth of cysts, altering renal function. Cystic growth is supported by major changes in cellular metabolism, some of which involve the mitochondrion, a major storage site for Ca2+ and a key organelle in cellular Ca2+ signaling. The goal here was to understand the role of components of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake complex in PC1-mutant cells in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We found that the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and voltage-dependent anion channels 1& 3 (VDAC) were down-regulated in different mouse and cell models of ADPKD along with the Ca2+-dependent enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDHX). The release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, and Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria were upregulated in PC1(polycystin)-null cells. We also observed an enhanced staining with MitoTracker Red CMXRos in PC1-null cultured cells than in PC1-containing cells and a substantially higher increase in response to ER Ca2+ release. Increased colocalization of the Ca2+ sensitive dye, rhodamine2, with MitoTracker Green suggested an increase Ca2+ entry into the mitochondria in PC1 null cells subsequent to Ca2+ release from the ER or from Ca2+ entry from the extracellular solution. These data clearly demonstrate abnormal release of Ca2+ by the ER and corresponding alterations in Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria in PC1−null cells. Importantly, inhibiting mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake with the specific inhibitor Ru360 inhibited cyst growth and altered both apoptosis and cell proliferation. We further show that the decrease in mitochondrial proteins and abnormally high Ca2+ signaling can be reversed by application of the cystic fibrosis (CFTR) corrector, VX-809. We conclude that enhanced Ca2+ signaling and alterations in proteins association with the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake complex are associated with malfunction of PC1. Finally, our results identify novel therapeutic targets for treating ADPKD.

Abstract: Pyroptosis is induced following inflammation via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammation causes pyroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells, which aggravates kidney damage and is involved in physiopathological processes in multiple renal diseases. Metadherin (Mtdh) induces inflammation by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Specifically, it induces inflammatory injury in the kidney by activating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which is involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, the role of Mtdh in pyroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells is unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether Mtdh participates in pyroptosis in LPS/adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-treated NRK-52E cells by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB signaling pathway. We induced pyroptosis in NRK-52E cells with LPS/ATP, after which Mtdh was silenced via transfection with small interfering RNA. LPS/ATP upregulated Mtdh expression and induced pyroptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in NRK-52E cells. However, downregulation of Mtdh expression resulted in the alleviation of pyroptosis in LPS/ATP-treated NRK-52E cells. Additionally, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB signaling pathway was inhibited. This demonstrates that downregulation of Mtdh expression results in the inhibition of pyroptosis in LPS/ATP-treated NRK-52E cells through the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which occurs via inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Acute damage to the intestinal epithelium can be repaired via de-differentiation of mature intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to a stem-like state, but there is a lack of knowledge on how intestinal stem cells function after chronic injury, such as in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We developed a chronic-injury model in human colonoid monolayers by repeated rounds of air-liquid interface and submerged culture. We use this model to understand how chronic intestinal damage affects the ability of IECs to (1) respond to microbial stimulation, using the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist FliC and (2) regenerate and protect the epithelium from further damage. Repeated rounds of damage impair the ability of IECs to regrow and respond to TLR stimulation. We also identify mRNA expression and DNA methylation changes in genes associated with IBD and colon cancer. This methodology results in a human model of recurrent IEC injury like that which occurs in IBD.

Abstract: Osteoclasts apoptosis plays vital roles in abnormal bone remodeling-associated diseases. It’s reported that Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) may affect osteoarthritis progression through osteoclasts function, while the specific mechanism remains unclear. To determine the effect of Sema3A on osteoclasts, we detected the apoptosis of RAW264.7 cells treated with Sema3A and explored the potential pathways in vitro. Firstly, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay was performed to assess the proliferation to screen out the appropriate concentration of Sema3A. Then, apoptosis was evaluated after cells were incubated with Sema3A for 0, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively, by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry. Finally, phosphorylation of Nrf2 and CREB, mitochondrial apoptosis-related markers and JNK/AKT/ERK pathway activation were examined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. As a result, flow cytometry and TUNEL staining revealed that RAW264.7 cells apoptosis was promoted by Sema3A-treated. Meanwhile, Western blot showed that cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-9 were highly expressed in Sema3A-treated RAW264.7 cells, and the ERK/JNK/AKT pathways were significantly inhibited by Sema3A in RAW264.7 cells. In a word, we demonstrated that Sema3A induces apoptosis of RAW264.7 cells probably by promoting mitochondrial apoptosis, which may provide a potential target for therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) has been documented to involved in the occurrence and development of different kinds of malignancies, containing breast cancer, glioma and prostatic cancer. However, the role of USP1 in gastric cancer (GC) is still obscure. In method, gene expression profiling interactive analysis and Kaplan-Meier Plotter databases were applied to analyze the prognostic value of USP1 in human cancers. The expression of USP1 was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and western blotting. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities were detected to determin the role of USP1 in the tumorigenesis of GC. As a result, USP1 was upregulated in GC samples relative to its paired normal samples. USP1 was a valuable diagnostic marker for GC, and its overexpression indicated the poor overall survival time of patients with GC. More importantly, USP1 levels were increased in GC cells and its silencing restrained the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of GC cells. In Conclusion, USP1 was upregulated in GC, and might be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic marker for GC. Moreover, USP1 silencing hindered the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of GC cells, revealing the oncogenic role of USP1 in GC progression.

Abstract: In plants, cell adhesion relies on balancing the integrity of the pectin-rich middle lamella with wall loosening during tissue expansion. Mutation of QUASIMODO2 (QUA2), a pectin methyltransferase, causes defective hypocotyl elongation and cell adhesion in Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls. However, the molecular function of QUA2 in cell adhesion is obscured by complex genetic and environmental interactions. To dissect the role of QUA2 in cell adhesion, we investigated a qua2 loss-of-function mutant and a suppressor mutant with restored cell adhesion, qua2 esmeralda1, using a combination of imaging and biochemical techniques. We found that qua2 hypocotyls have reductions in middle lamellae integrity, pectin methyl-esterase (PME) activity, pectin content and molecular mass, and immunodetected Ca2+-crosslinking at cell corners, but increased methyl-esterification and polygalacturonase (PG) activity, with qua2 esmd1 having wild type-like or intermediate phenotypes. Our findings suggest that excessive pectin degradation prevents pectin accumulation and the formation of a sufficiently Ca2+-crosslinked network to maintain cell adhesion in qua2 mutants. We propose that PME and PG activities balance tissue-level expansion and cell separation. Together, these data provide insight into the cause of cell adhesion defects in qua2 mutants and highlight the importance of harmonizing pectin modification and degradation during plant growth and development.

Abstract: Summary
T cell immunity is crucial for control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and has been studied widely on a quantitative level. However, the quality of responses, in particular of CD8+ T cells, has only been investigated marginally so far. Here, we isolate T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires specific for immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes restricted to common human Leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules in convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are detected up to 12 months after infection. TCR repertoires are diverse, with heterogeneous functional avidity and cytotoxicity toward virus-infected cells, as demonstrated for TCR-engineered T cells. High TCR functionality correlates with gene signatures that, remarkably, could be retrieved for each epitope:HLA combination analyzed. Overall, our data demonstrate that polyclonal and highly functional CD8+ TCRs—classic features of protective immunity—are recruited upon mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing tools to assess the quality of and potentially restore functional CD8+ T cell immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The hormone-stimulated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulates transcription by interacting with thousands of enhancers and GR binding sites (GBSs) throughout the genome. Here, we examined the effects of GR binding on enhancer dynamics and investigated the contributions of individual GBSs to the hormone response. Hormone treatment resulted in genome-wide reorganization of the enhancer landscape in breast cancer cells. Upstream of the DDIT4 oncogene, GR bound to four sites constituting a hormone-dependent super enhancer. Three GBSs were required as hormone-dependent enhancers that differentially promoted histone acetylation, transcription frequency, and burst size. Conversely, the fourth site suppressed transcription and hormone treatment alleviated this suppression. GR binding within the super enhancer promoted a loop-switching mechanism that allowed interaction of the DDIT4 TSS with the active GBSs. The unique functions of each GR binding site contribute to hormone-induced transcriptional heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential for targeted modulation of oncogene expression.

Abstract: Summary
An increasing number of genetic diseases are linked to deregulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Loss-of-function mutations in the RING-between-RING (RBR) family E3 ligase RNF216 (TRIAD3) cause Gordon-Holmes syndrome (GHS) and related neurodegenerative diseases. Functionally, RNF216 assembles K63-linked ubiquitin chains and has been implicated in regulation of innate immunity signaling pathways and synaptic plasticity. Here, we report crystal structures of key RNF216 reaction states including RNF216 in complex with ubiquitin and its reaction product, K63 di-ubiquitin. Our data provide a molecular explanation for chain-type specificity and reveal the molecular basis for disruption of RNF216 function by pathogenic GHS mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how RNF216 activity and chain-type specificity are regulated by phosphorylation and that RNF216 is allosterically activated by K63-linked di-ubiquitin. These molecular insights expand our understanding of RNF216 function and its role in disease and further define the mechanistic diversity of the RBR E3 ligase family.

Abstract: Tongue cancer is the most prevalent type of oral cancer. Our previous study revealed that JAG1 exerted an oncogenic effect on tongue carcinoma through the JAG1/Notch pathway. In this study, a lncRNA PTTG3P which was upregulated in tongue cancer, was found to be positively correlated with JAG1. In CAL-27 and SCC4 cells, PTTG3P silencing significantly decreased JAG1 proteins and the ability of tongue tumor cells to proliferate and migrate. PTTG3P overexpression exhibited the opposite effect on CAL-27 and SCC4 cells. PPTG3P directly bound miR-142-5p, and miR-142-5p directly bound 3′UTR of JAG1 and inhibited the expression levels of JAG1. As opposed to PTTG3P silencing, miR-142-5p inhibition increased JAG1 protein levels and tongue cancer cell proliferation and migration; moreover, miR-142-5p inhibition substantially reversed the effects of PTTG3P silencing. Finally, the PPTG3P/miR-142-5p axis regulated the level of NICD, Notch downstream c-myc, and cyclin D1, as well as EMT markers Snail, Twist, and Vimentin. In conclusion, the PTTG3P/miR-142-5p axis modulates tongue cancer aggressiveness through JAG1, potentially through a JAG1/Notch signaling pathway.

Abstract: Kinesin family member 26B (KIF26B) is reported differently expressed in multiple neoplasms and exerts a pivotal role in carcinogenesis. To date, the relationship between KIF26B and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unaddressed. This study explored the possible roles and mechanisms of KIF26B in NSCLC. We observed high levels of KIF26B in NSCLC, and demonstrated that high KIF26B levels predicted an overall shorter duration of survival. Functional experiments demonstrated that restraint of KIF26B by gene knockdown exhibited remarkable tumor-suppressive effects in NSCLC in vitro, including repression of cell proliferation, induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, suppression of cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and enhancement of chemotherapeutic sensitivity. The study further revealed that inhibition of KIF26B was able to affect the activation of β-catenin via regulation of the AKT/GSK-3β axis. Moreover, forced expression of β-catenin could reverse KIF26B-silencing-evoked tumor-suppressive effects. Importantly, NSCLC cells with KIF26B silencing exhibited decreased growth potential in nude mice in vivo. Collectively, our data indicate that restraint of KIF26B has a tumor-suppressive role in NSCLC by affecting the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway. This work unveils a pivotal role of KIF26B in NSCLC and suggests it as a viable target for anti-NSCLC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
B cells are important in immunity to both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination, but B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire development in these contexts has not been compared. We analyze serial samples from 171 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and 63 vaccine recipients and find the global BCR repertoire differs between them. Following infection, immunoglobulin (Ig)G1/3 and IgA1 BCRs increase, somatic hypermutation (SHM) decreases, and, in severe disease, IgM and IgA clones are expanded. In contrast, after vaccination, the proportion of IgD/M BCRs increase, SHM is unchanged, and expansion of IgG clones is prominent. VH1-24, which targets the N-terminal domain (NTD) and contributes to neutralization, is expanded post infection except in the most severe disease. Infection generates a broad distribution of SARS-CoV-2-specific clones predicted to target the spike protein, while a more focused response after vaccination mainly targets the spike's receptor-binding domain. Thus, the nature of SARS-CoV-2 exposure differentially affects BCR repertoire development, potentially informing vaccine strategies.

Abstract: Purpose
Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the common endocrine malignancy. Kv channel interacting protein 3 (KCNIP3) has been investigated in a variety of diseases, but its role and underlying mechanism in PTC are not fully delineated. Based on this, this study mainly explored the possible mechanism of KCNIP3 in PTC.
Methods
KCNIP3 expression in PTC tissues was analyzed by ENCORI and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). KCNIP3 overexpression (oe-KCNIP3) or KCNIP3 silence (si-KCNIP3) was transfected into IHH4 and FTC-133 cells, respectively. Then cell biological behaviors were detected by cell function assays. The expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- and Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related proteins were quantified by qRT-PCR and western blot. Lastly, IHH4 cells were treated with LiCl and the above assays were performed again.
Results
The expression of KCNIP3 was decreased in PTC. After transfection, oe-KCNIP3 inhibited the PTC cell viability, cloning, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis, and meanwhile, oe-KCNIP3 reduced the EMT and Wnt pathway activation. In contrast, si-KCNIP3 had the opposite effect. Moreover, LiCl, a Wnt signaling pathway activator, could reverse the above effects of oe-KCNIP3.
Conclusion
KCNIP3 might play an anticarcinogenic role in PTC via inhibiting the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Nanoparticle (NP) vaccine formulations promote immune responses through multiple mechanisms. We recently reported that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) triggers trafficking of glycosylated HIV Env-immunogen NPs to lymph node follicles. Here, we investigate effects of MBL and complement on NP forms of HIV and other viral antigens. MBL recognition of oligomannose on gp120 nanoparticles significantly increases antigen accumulation in lymph nodes and antigen-specific germinal center (GC) responses. MBL and complement also mediate follicular trafficking and enhance GC responses to influenza, HBV, and HPV particulate antigens. Using model protein nanoparticles bearing titrated levels of glycosylation, we determine that mannose patches at a minimal density of 2.1 × 10−3 mannose patches/nm2 are required to trigger follicular targeting, which increases with increasing glycan density up to at least ∼8.2 × 10−3 patches/nm2. Thus, innate immune recognition of glycans has a significant impact on humoral immunity, and these findings provide a framework for engineering glycan recognition to optimize vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Intercellular transfer of toxic proteins between neurons is thought to contribute to neurodegenerative disease, but whether direct interneuronal protein transfer occurs in the healthy brain is not clear. To assess the prevalence and identity of transferred proteins and the cellular specificity of transfer, we biotinylated retinal ganglion cell proteins in vivo and examined biotinylated proteins transported through the rodent visual circuit using microscopy, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry. Electron microscopy demonstrated preferential transfer of biotinylated proteins from retinogeniculate inputs to excitatory lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons compared with GABAergic neurons. An unbiased mass spectrometry-based screen identified ∼200 transneuronally transported proteins (TNTPs) isolated from the visual cortex. The majority of TNTPs are present in neuronal exosomes, and virally expressed TNTPs, including tau and β-synuclein, were detected in isolated exosomes and postsynaptic neurons. Our data demonstrate transfer of diverse endogenous proteins between neurons in the healthy intact brain and suggest that TNTP transport may be mediated by exosomes.

Abstract: We report the ocular features of the tongue sole, Cynoglossus bilineatus (Lacepède, 1802), a marine, bottom-dwelling flatfish. In this species, both eyes are located juxtaposed on the same side of the flat head. Histology revealed the sclera to be fibrous (collagenous) in nature. The choroid possesses the choriocapillaris, and adjacent to it, 3–4 rows of iridophores with stacks of cytoplasmic platelets. No choroidal gland is present. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) contains scanty melanin granules. Its vitread half is modified into a dense tapetum with lipid spheres (about 0.34 μm in diameter). In juveniles, the tapetal spheres arise by budding from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the RPE. There are blood vessels within the retina; the vitreal vessels penetrate the retina and ramify close to the level of the outer limiting membrane. The vessels are capillaries in nature. The photoreceptor layer contains abundant rods, and twin cones and single cones, being arranged into square mosaics. The optic disc is non-pleated and shows pan- cytokeratin immunopositivity, which is related to the bundled cytokeratin filaments detected in astrocytes by electron microscopy. The retinal tapetum and choroidal iridophores help the species to live in a muddy bottom having dim-light environment. The lack of a choroidal gland, hypoxic aquatic condition and presence of a dense retinal tapetum (that limits O2 transport to the photoreceptors) appear to have favored the proliferation of vitreal vessels within the retina in this species. The fibrous sclera has probably arisen to provide structural support to the eye in migration from the lateral to the dorsal aspect of the head during larval metamorphosis.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines may target epitopes that reduce durability or increase the potential for escape from vaccine-induced immunity. Using synthetic vaccinology, we have developed rationally immune-focused SARS-CoV-2 Spike-based vaccines. Glycans can be employed to alter antibody responses to infection and vaccines. Utilizing computational modeling and in vitro screening, we have incorporated glycans into the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and assessed antigenic profiles. We demonstrate that glycan-coated RBD immunogens elicit stronger neutralizing antibodies and have engineered seven multivalent configurations. Advanced DNA delivery of engineered nanoparticle vaccines rapidly elicits potent neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs, hamsters, and multiple mouse models, including human ACE2 and human antibody repertoire transgenics. RBD nanoparticles induce high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies against variants of concern with durable titers beyond 6 months. Single, low-dose immunization protects against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Single-dose coronavirus vaccines via DNA-launched nanoparticles provide a platform for rapid clinical translation of potent and durable coronavirus vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous recombination is essential to maintain genome stability in response to DNA damage. Here, we have used genome-wide sequencing to quantitatively analyze at nucleotide resolution the dynamics of DNA end resection, re-synthesis, and gene conversion at a double-strand break. Resection initiates asymmetrically in an MRX-independent manner before proceeding steadily in both directions. Sgs1, Exo1, Rad51, and Srs2 differently regulate the rate and symmetry of early and late resection. Exo1 also ensures the coexistence of resection and re-synthesis, while Srs2 guarantees a constant and symmetrical DNA re-polymerization. Gene conversion is MMR independent, spans only a minor fraction of the resected region, and its unidirectionality depends on Srs2. Finally, these repair factors prevent the development of alterations remote from the DNA lesion, such as subtelomeric instability, duplication of genomic regions, and over-replication of Ty elements. Altogether, this approach allows a quantitative analysis and a direct genome-wide visualization of DNA repair by homologous recombination.

Abstract: Summary
High-intensity transcription and replication supercoil DNA to levels that can impede or halt these processes. As a potent transcription amplifier and replication accelerator, the proto-oncogene MYC must manage this interfering torsional stress. By comparing gene expression with the recruitment of topoisomerases and MYC to promoters, we surmised a direct association of MYC with topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and TOP2 that was confirmed in vitro and in cells. Beyond recruiting topoisomerases, MYC directly stimulates their activities. We identify a MYC-nucleated “topoisome” complex that unites TOP1 and TOP2 and increases their levels and activities at promoters, gene bodies, and enhancers. Whether TOP2A or TOP2B is included in the topoisome is dictated by the presence of MYC versus MYCN, respectively. Thus, in vitro and in cells, MYC assembles tools that simplify DNA topology and promote genome function under high output conditions.

Abstract: Summary
During exploration, animals form an internal map of an environment by combining information about landmarks and the animal’s movement, a process that depends on the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus (DG) is the first stage of the hippocampal circuit where self-motion (“where”) and sensory cue information (“what”) are integrated, but it remains unknown how DG neurons encode this information during cognitive map formation. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice running on a treadmill along with online cue manipulation, we identify robust sensory cue responses in DG granule cells. Cue cell responses are stable, stimulus-specific, and accompanied by inhibition of nearby neurons. This demonstrates the existence of “cue cells” in addition to better characterized “place cells” in the DG. We hypothesize that the DG supports parallel channels of spatial and non-spatial information that contribute distinctly to downstream computations and affect roles of the DG in spatial navigation and episodic memory.

Abstract: Summary
Quantitative subcellular metabolomic measurements can explain the roles of metabolites in cellular processes but are subject to multiple confounding factors. We developed stable isotope labeling of essential nutrients in cell culture-subcellular fractionation (SILEC-SF), which uses isotope-labeled internal standard controls that are present throughout fractionation and processing to quantify acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesters in subcellular compartments by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We tested SILEC-SF in a range of sample types and examined the compartmentalized responses to oxygen tension, cellular differentiation, and nutrient availability. Application of SILEC-SF to the challenging analysis of the nuclear compartment revealed a nuclear acyl-CoA profile distinct from that of the cytosol, with notable nuclear enrichment of propionyl-CoA. Using isotope tracing, we identified the branched chain amino acid isoleucine as a major metabolic source of nuclear propionyl-CoA and histone propionylation, thus revealing a new mechanism of crosstalk between metabolism and the epigenome.

Abstract: Growth and patterning of Drosophila wing depends upon the sequential organizing activities of Hedgehog (Hh) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathways. The Hh signaling directly activates the expression of dpp through the transcription factor cubitus interruptus (Ci). Dpp itself functions as a long-range morphogen to promote cell proliferation and differentiation through an essential transcription factor encoded by Mad. Here we report that the Mad1-2 allele exhibits phenotypes distinct from classical Dpp pathway mutants in the developing wing. The activity of Dpp signaling is attenuated in Mad1-2 mutant cells. However, activation of Dpp signaling is found in a subset of cells surrounding homozygous Mad1-2 clones when the clones are located at the anterior compartment of wing disc. Further analysis reveals that Mad1-2 mutant cells display high level of Hh signaling activity and accumulate significant amount of Ci. Unexpectedly, whole genome resequencing identifies multiple mutations in the 3′UTR region of Pka-C1 genomic loci in the Mad1-2 stock. We provide genetic and molecular evidence that the Pka-C1 mutations carried by Mad1-2 likely underlies the observed Hh signaling defects. Therefore, the contribution of Pka-C1 mutation should be taken in consideration when analyzing Mad1-2 phenotypes. The isolation of independent Mad and Pka-C1 alleles from the Mad1-2 stock further supports our conclusions.

Abstract: Pathogenic fungi hide from their hosts by camouflage, obscuring immunogenic cell wall components such as beta-glucan with innocuous coverings such as mannoproteins and alpha-glucan that are less readily recognised by the host. Attempts to understand how such processes are regulated have met with varying success. Typically studies focus on understanding the transcriptional response of fungi to either their reservoir environment or the host. However, such approaches do not fully address this research question, due to the layers of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation that occur within a cell. Although in animals the impact of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation has been well characterised, our knowledge of these processes in the fungal kingdom is more limited. Mutations in RNA-binding proteins, like Ssd1 and Candida albicans Slr1, affect cell wall composition and fungal virulence indicating that post-transcriptional regulation plays a key role in these processes. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of fungal post-transcriptional regulation, and link this to potential mechanisms of immune evasion by drawing on studies from model yeast and plant pathogenic fungi. We highlight several RNA-binding proteins that regulate cell wall synthesis and could be involved in local translation of cell wall components. Expanding our knowledge on post-transcriptional regulation in human fungal pathogens is essential to fully comprehend fungal virulence strategies and for the design of novel antifungal therapies.

Abstract: Excessive calcium (Ca2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents an important hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. ER is recharged from Ca2+ through the so-called Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) thus providing Ca2+ signals to regulate critical cell functions. Single transmembrane-spanning domain protein stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1), mainly residing in the ER, and plasmalemmal channel Orai1 represent the SOCE key components at neuronal level. However, many other proteins participate to ER Ca2+ refilling including the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform 1 (NCX1), whose regulation by ER remains unknown. In this study, we tested the possibility that neuronal NCX1 may take part to SOCE through the interaction with STIM1. In rat primary cortical neurons and in nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells NCX1 knocking down by siRNA strategy significantly prevented SOCE as well as SOCE pharmacological inhibition by SKF-96365 and 2-APB. A significant reduction of SOCE was recorded also in synaptosomes from ncx1−/− mice brain compared with ncx1+/+ mice. Double labeling confocal experiments showed a large co-localization between NCX1 and STIM1 in rat primary cortical neurons. Accordingly, NCX1 and STIM1 co-immunoprecipitated and functionally interacted each other during ischemic preconditioning, a phenomenon inducing ischemic tolerance. However, STIM1 knocking down reduced NCX1 activity recorded by either patch-clamp electrophysiology or Fura-2 single-cell microfluorimetry. Furthermore, canonical transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6) was identified as the mechanism mediating local increase of sodium (Na+) useful to drive NCX1 reverse mode and, therefore, NCX1-mediated Ca2+ refilling. In fact, TRPC6 not only interacted with STIM1, as shown by the co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation with the ER Ca2+ sensor, but it also mediated 1,3-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4′-[1,4,10-trioxa-7,13-diazacyclopentadecane-7,13-diylbis(5-methoxy-6,12-benzofurandiyl)]bis-, tetrakis[(acetyloxy)methyl] ester (SBFI)-monitored Na+ increase elicited by thapsigargin in primary cortical neurons. Accordingly, efficient TRPC6 knockdown prevented thapsigargin-induced intracellular Na+ elevation and SOCE. Collectively, we identify NCX1 as a new partner of STIM1 in mediating SOCE, whose activation in the reverse mode may be facilitated by the local increase of Na+ concentration due to the interaction between STIM1 and TRPC6 in primary cortical neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a vital barrier that must balance protection and nutrient uptake. Small RNAs are crucial regulators of the envelope composition and function. Here, using RIL-seq to capture the Hfq-mediated RNA-RNA interactome in Salmonella enterica, we discover envelope-related riboregulators, including OppX. We show that OppX acts as an RNA sponge of MicF sRNA, a prototypical porin repressor. OppX originates from the 5′ UTR of oppABCDF, encoding the major inner-membrane oligopeptide transporter, and sequesters MicF’s seed region to derepress the synthesis of the porin OmpF. Intriguingly, OppX operates as a true sponge, storing MicF in an inactive complex without affecting its levels or stability. Conservation of the opp-OppX-MicF-ompF axis in related bacteria suggests that it serves an important mechanism, adjusting envelope porosity to specific transport capacity. These data also highlight the resource value of this Salmonella RNA interactome, which will aid in unraveling RNA-centric regulation in enteric pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Reinvigoration of antitumor immunity remains an unmet challenge. Our retrospective analyses revealed that cancer patients who took antihistamines during immunotherapy treatment had significantly improved survival. We uncovered that histamine and histamine receptor H1 (HRH1) are frequently increased in the tumor microenvironment and induce T cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, HRH1-activated macrophages polarize toward an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype with increased expression of the immune checkpoint VISTA, rendering T cells dysfunctional. HRH1 knockout or antihistamine treatment reverted macrophage immunosuppression, revitalized T cell cytotoxic function, and restored immunotherapy response. Allergy, via the histamine-HRH1 axis, facilitated tumor growth and induced immunotherapy resistance in mice and humans. Importantly, cancer patients with low plasma histamine levels had a more than tripled objective response rate to anti-PD-1 treatment compared with patients with high plasma histamine. Altogether, pre-existing allergy or high histamine levels in cancer patients can dampen immunotherapy responses and warrant prospectively exploring antihistamines as adjuvant agents for combinatorial immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental genes such as Xist, which initiates X chromosome inactivation, are controlled by complex cis-regulatory landscapes, which decode multiple signals to establish specific spatiotemporal expression patterns. Xist integrates information on X chromosome dosage and developmental stage to trigger X inactivation in the epiblast specifically in female embryos. Through a pooled CRISPR screen in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, we identify functional enhancer elements of Xist at the onset of random X inactivation. Chromatin profiling reveals that X-dosage controls the promoter-proximal region, while differentiation cues activate several distal enhancers. The strongest distal element lies in an enhancer cluster associated with a previously unannotated Xist-enhancing regulatory transcript, which we named Xert. Developmental cues and X-dosage are thus decoded by distinct regulatory regions, which cooperate to ensure female-specific Xist upregulation at the correct developmental time. With this study, we start to disentangle how multiple, functionally distinct regulatory elements interact to generate complex expression patterns in mammals.

Abstract: Aims: To gain insights into FKBP regulation of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and Ca2+ signaling, we introduced the point mutation (N771D-RyR2) corresponding to skeletal muscle mutation (N760D-RyR1) associated with central core disease (CCD) via CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing in the RyR2 FKBP binding site expressed in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSCCMs). Patients inflicted with CCD and other hereditary skeletal muscle diseases often show higher incidence of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. Methods and Results: Ca2+ imaging of voltage-clamped N771D-RyR2 mutant compared to WT hiPSCCMs showed: (1) ∼30% suppressed ICa with no significant changes in the gating kinetics of ICa; (2) 29% lower SR Ca2+ content and 33% lower RyR2 Ca2+ leak; (3) higher CICR gain and 30–35% increased efficiency of ICa-triggered Ca2± release; (4) higher incidence of aberrant SR Ca2+ releases, DADs, and Ca2+ sparks; (5) no change in fractional Ca2+-release, action potential morphology, sensitivity to isoproterenol, and sarcomeric FKBP-binding pattern. Conclusions: The more frequent spontaneous Ca2+ releases and longer Ca2+ sparks underlie the increased incidence of DADs and cellular arrhythmogenesis of N771D-RyR2 mutant. The smaller RyR2 Ca2± leak and SR content result from suppressed ICa that is compensated by higher CICR gain.

Abstract: Acidic organelles act as intracellular Ca2+ stores; they actively sequester Ca2+ in their lumina and release it to the cytosol upon activation of endo-lysosomal Ca2+ channels. Recent data suggest important roles of endo-lysosomal Ca2+ channels, the Two-Pore Channels (TPCs) and the TRPML channels (mucolipins), in different aspects of immune-cell function, particularly impacting membrane trafficking, vesicle fusion/fission and secretion. Remarkably, different channels on the same acidic vesicles can couple to different downstream physiology. Endo-lysosomal Ca2+ stores can act under different modalities, be they acting alone (via local Ca2+ nanodomains around TPCs/TRPMLs) or in conjunction with the ER Ca2+ store (to either promote or suppress global ER Ca2+ release). These different modalities impinge upon functions as broad as phagocytosis, cell-killing, anaphylaxis, immune memory, thrombostasis, and chemotaxis.

Abstract: Due to the malignancy of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), investigations of novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. In our present study, significant up-regulation of Actin-like protein 8 (ACTL8) in OSCC patients was observed by bioinformatics analysis with RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The results of Chi-square test revealed that there was a significant correlation between ACTL8 expression and tumor status (T1 + T2/T3+T4) (P = 0.004). Survival analysis indicated a negative correlation between ACTL8 overexpression and prognosis in OSCC (P = 3.984e-02). An ACTL8 knockdown experiment was conducted to evaluate the function of ACTL8 on OSCC cell biological behaviors. The results revealed that knockdown of ACTL8 significantly inhibited the growth and mobility, arrested cell cycle and promoted apoptosis of TCA-83 and CAL27 cells. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and western blots demonstrated that activation of cell cycle signaling pathway was inhibited by knockdown of ACTL8, as we observed the down-regulation of 4 key proteins (CDK1, cyclin E1, cyclin B2 and c-Myc) in this pathway. The present investigation indicates that ACTL8 plays an oncogenic role in the pathogenesis of OSCC, suggesting that ACTL8 may be a promising therapeutic target and prognosis marker for human OSCC.

Abstract: This study aimed at the effect of vitamin B12 (VB12) on tramadol (TRM) induced pituitary-gonadal Axis toxicity. Thirty-two (32) adult male rats were randomized into four groups of eight (n = 8) rats each. Group A served as control was given 1 mL normal saline, group B received 50 mg /kg bwt TRM, group C received 0.5 mg/kg bwt VB12 and group D received 50 mg /kg bwt TRM and 0.5 mg/kg bwt VB12 through gastric gavage daily for 8 weeks. Parameters tested include sperm parameter, male reproductive hormone, testicular histology, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), acid phosphate (ACP), and alkaline phosphate (ALP) activity, steroidogenic protein, cytochrome P450 A1, nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor- kappa B (NF-κB), oxidative and antioxidant makers. Tramadol significantly decreases sperm quality, hormone, steroidogenic protein, cytochrome P450 A1, ACP, ALP, and increases glucose, LDH, oxidative stress, mtTFA, and UCP2, p53 expression, NO, iNOS, NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and caspase-3 activity. Degenerative alterations of the testes’ and pituitary architecture and perturbation of spermatogenesis were observed in TRM-treated rats. The intervention of VB12 downregulated testicular oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, glucose, lactate, LDH, p53, caspase-3, mtTFA, and UCP2. And upregulate antioxidant, sperm quality, hormone, and spermatogenic cells. Vitamin B12 exhibited mitigation against TRM–induced testicular dysfunction via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.

Abstract: Summary
In their Matters Arising article, McMullan et al. (2022) offer alternative explanations for the phenotypes we observed upon stimulation and ablation of TrkCCreERT2-positive neurons in mice. Their interpretations are focused on two aspects: first, whether the vasoconstriction we observed upon activation of TrkCCreERT2 neurons is really mediated by TrkC/TH-positive neurons, or whether it might stem from stimulation of somatic nociceptors that also express TrkC; and second, whether the lethality observed after ablation of TrkCCreERT2 neurons might be a result of ablation of vagal afferents and not TrkC/TH neurons located in the spinal ganglia. Central to both of these concerns is the expression and recombination efficiency of the TrkCCreERT2 transgene in these other cell types. This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the McMullan et al. (2022) Matters Arising paper, published concurrently in Cell Reports.

Abstract: Summary
Exon back-splicing-generated circular RNAs, as a group, can suppress double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR) in cells. We have sought to synthesize immunogenicity-free, short dsRNA-containing RNA circles as PKR inhibitors. Here, we report that RNA circles synthesized by permuted self-splicing thymidylate synthase (td) introns from T4 bacteriophage or by Anabaena pre-tRNA group I intron could induce an immune response. Autocatalytic splicing introduces ∼74 nt td or ∼186 nt Anabaena extraneous fragments that can distort the folding status of original circular RNAs or form structures themselves to provoke innate immune responses. In contrast, synthesized RNA circles produced by T4 RNA ligase without extraneous fragments exhibit minimized immunogenicity. Importantly, directly ligated circular RNAs that form short dsRNA regions efficiently suppress PKR activation 103- to 106-fold higher than reported chemical compounds C16 and 2-AP, highlighting the future use of circular RNAs as potent inhibitors for diseases related to PKR overreaction.

Abstract: Summary
How mutations in FUS lead to neuronal dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients remains unclear. To examine mechanisms underlying ALS FUS dysfunction, we generate C. elegans knockin models using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, creating R524S and P525L ALS FUS models. Although FUS inclusions are not detected, ALS FUS animals show defective neuromuscular function and locomotion under stress. Unlike animals lacking the endogenous FUS ortholog, ALS FUS animals have impaired neuronal autophagy and increased SQST-1 accumulation in motor neurons. Loss of sqst-1, the C. elegans ortholog for ALS-linked, autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, suppresses both neuromuscular and stress-induced locomotion defects in ALS FUS animals, but does not suppress neuronal autophagy defects. Therefore, autophagy dysfunction is upstream of, and not dependent on, SQSTM1 function in ALS FUS pathogenesis. Combined, our findings demonstrate that autophagy dysfunction likely contributes to protein homeostasis and neuromuscular defects in ALS FUS knockin animals.

Abstract: Summary
Plants respond to higher temperatures by the action of heat stress (HS) transcription factors (Hsfs), which control the onset, early response, and long-term acclimation to HS. Members of the HsfA1 subfamily, such as tomato HsfA1a, are the central regulators of HS response, and their activity is fine-tuned by other Hsfs. We identify tomato HsfA7 as capacitor of HsfA1a during the early HS response. Upon a mild temperature increase, HsfA7 is induced in an HsfA1a-dependent manner. The subsequent interaction of the two Hsfs prevents the stabilization of HsfA1a resulting in a negative feedback mechanism. Under prolonged or severe HS, HsfA1a and HsfA7 complexes stimulate the induction of genes required for thermotolerance. Therefore, HsfA7 exhibits a co-repressor mode at mild HS by regulating HsfA1a abundance to moderate the upregulation of HS-responsive genes. HsfA7 undergoes a temperature-dependent transition toward a co-activator of HsfA1a to enhance the acquired thermotolerance capacity of tomato plants.

Abstract: Introduction
Recent studies show that the paracrine immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are mediated by the secretion of interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF β), and nitric oxide (NO). The preconditioning of MSCs improves their immunomodulatory characteristics. Chitosan is a biopolymer with low toxicity and biodegradability, used as a membrane for MSCs three-dimensional culture. The present study aimed to evaluate the levels of immunomodulatory mediators of mesenchymal cells cultured on the chitosan film.
Materials & methods
MSCs were isolated from abdominal adipose tissue of BALB/c mice. Flow cytometry and differential culture medium were used to confirm the identity of isolated mesenchymal stem cells. The MSCs were divided into three groups; The first group was treated with 10 ng/mL LPS. The second group was seeded in the flasks coated with the chitosan film (3% w/v). The last group was cultured in the flasks without any preconditioning. After 72 h, IL-10, TGF-β, and NO concentrations were measured in the conditioned media. In addition, the arginase activity in mesenchymal stem cells was measured using a colorimetric method.
Results
The proliferative spindle-shaped MSCs formed several three-dimensional spheroids on the chitosan film. It was shown that the level of TGF-β and IL-10 were increased significantly after treatment with LPS (P = 0.02) and spheroid formation (P = 0.01). In addition, the arginase activity was enormously augmented in spheroids compared to controls (7.13-fold increase; 1.71 ± 0.08 and 0.24 ± 0.01 respectively; P = 0.021). On the other hand, the LPS treatment but not the culture on chitosan film increased the NO level significantly (P = 0.02 and P = 0.14, respectively).
Conclusion
Using chitosan film as a three-dimensional culture strategy significantly affects the production of immunosuppressive factors by MSCs in vitro through increased secretion of TGF-β and IL-10 and arginase activity.

Abstract: GH16 chitin transferases, GH17 β-1,3-glucan transferases, and GH72 β-1,3-glucan/lichenin transferases are important fungal cell wall crosslinking enzymes. The Neurospora crassa genome encodes three genes from the GH17 gene family and five members in the GH16 subfamily 18 and 19 fungal chitin transferases. We created deletion mutants lacking all three GH17 genes and determined that they had wild type morphology and are more sensitive to cell wall perturbation reagents than the wild type. We also created deletion mutants lacking all five GH16 subfamily 18 and 19 genes and found that they had wild type morphology and are more sensitive to cell wall perturbation reagents than the wild type. We conclude that GH16 and GH17 enzymes play roles in cell wall biogenesis. In N. crassa, GH72 enzymes have been reported to be lichenin transferases, while in other fungi they have been shown to be the β-1,3-glucan transferases. Neurospora triple GH72 deletions give rise to a tight colonial morphology, sensitivity to cell wall perturbation reagents, and release of cell wall proteins into the medium. To ask if GH72 and GH17 enzymes might be redundant in N. crassa, we created sextuple mutants lacking the three GH72 genes and the three GH17 genes and found that they were indistinguishable from the GH72 triple mutant. We also found that a recombinant GH72 enzyme is able to form a lichenin-enzyme intermediate demonstrating that GH72 enzymes are lichenin transferases. The N. crassa GH72 enzymes are lichenin transferases and are not redundant with the GH17 β-1,3-glucan transferases.

Abstract: Summary
Acetyl-CoA is a key intermediate situated at the intersection of many metabolic pathways. The reliance of histone acetylation on acetyl-CoA enables the coordination of gene expression with metabolic state. Abundant acetyl-CoA has been linked to the activation of genes involved in cell growth or tumorigenesis through histone acetylation. However, the role of histone acetylation in transcription under low levels of acetyl-CoA remains poorly understood. Here, we use a yeast starvation model to observe the dramatic alteration in the global occupancy of histone acetylation following carbon starvation; the location of histone acetylation marks shifts from growth-promoting genes to gluconeogenic and fat metabolism genes. This reallocation is mediated by both the histone deacetylase Rpd3p and the acetyltransferase Gcn5p, a component of the SAGA transcriptional coactivator. Our findings reveal an unexpected switch in the specificity of histone acetylation to promote pathways that generate acetyl-CoA for oxidation when acetyl-CoA is limiting.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrosis is a major cause of mortality worldwide, characterized by myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix deposition. Systemic sclerosis is a prototypic fibrotic disease in which CXCL4 is increased and strongly correlates with skin and lung fibrosis. Here we aim to elucidate the role of CXCL4 in fibrosis development. CXCL4 levels are increased in multiple inflammatory and fibrotic mouse models, and, using CXCL4-deficient mice, we demonstrate the essential role of CXCL4 in promoting fibrotic events in the skin, lungs, and heart. Overexpressing human CXCL4 in mice aggravates, whereas blocking CXCL4 reduces, bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Single-cell ligand-receptor analysis predicts CXCL4 to affect endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In vitro, we confirm that CXCL4 directly induces myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis in different precursor cells, including endothelial cells, by stimulating endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our findings identify a pivotal role of CXCL4 in fibrosis, further substantiating the potential role of neutralizing CXCL4 as a therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Literatures have demonstrated that propofol can improve the efficacy of cisplatin, and miR-195 is implicated in the underlying mechanism concerning the anticancer effects of propofol. However, correlation between propofol and miR-195 has been little studied. This study clarified that propofol enhanced the inhibitory effect of cisplatin in liver cancer cells via miR-195-5p. 50 samples of liver cancer and para-cancer tissues in patients were collected and the difference in the expression of miR-195-5p was then analyzed. The liver cancer cells treated with gradient concentrations of cisplatin (3, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 μg/mL) and propofol (2, 5, 10 μg/mL) were tested for drug toxicity using CCK-8 assay. Next, following the transfection, the effects of propofol, cisplatin and miR-195-5p on the functions of liver cancer cells and the expressions of related proteins were analyzed by clone formation, flow cytometry and western blot. The downstream target genes of miR-195-5p were predicted by bio-informatics analysis and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay, and their expressions in cancer cell was also calculated. The changes on the expressions of target genes were further detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. MiR-195-5p was lowly-expressed in liver cancer, and the up-regulation of miR-195-5p enhanced the sensitivity of liver cancer cells to cisplatin. Propofol inhibited the viability of liver cancer cells and stimulated the up-regulation of miR-195-5p. Propofol enhanced the lethality of cisplatin to liver cancer cells and reversed the repressive effects of miR-195-5p inhibitor on the efficacy of cisplatin. CCNE1 was the downstream target gene of miR-195-5p and its expression was up-regulated by miR-195-5p inhibitor in cisplatin-treated liver cancer cells. Collectively, propofol enhances the lethality of cisplatin to liver cancer cells by up-regulating miR-195-5p.

Abstract: Objective
The study objective was to assess the therapeutic potential of Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) and Flutamide combination for metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) treatment.
Material and method
LNCaP and PC3 cell lines were treated with different concentrations of ATO and PCa conventional drug Flutamide alone and/or in combination to find effective doses and IC50 values. Percentages of apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin/PI staining and the proliferative inhibitory effect was assessed by Micro Culture Tetrazolium Test (MTT). Expression of SNAIL, KLK2, E-cadherin, and angiogenesis genes (VEGFA and VEGFC), and apoptosis genes (Bcl2, and P53) were examined by real-time PCR.
Results
The combination of Flutamide and ATO significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and inhibited PCa cells proliferation compared with each drug alone in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. Generally, both cell lines treated with the combination of Flutamide and ATO showed a decrease in expression of KLK2, angiogenesis genes (VEGFA and VEGFC), and apoptosis gene (Bcl2), and an increase in expression of E-cadherin and P53 genes; however, contradictory findings were found regarding SNAIL expression in LNCaP and PC3 cells.
Conclusion
The combination therapy with ATO and flutamide has augmented the anti-tumor effect on LNCaP and PC3 cells, which probably originates from their potential to induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of PCa cells simultaneously.

Abstract: Summary
In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), differentiation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) into myofibroblast-like cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can both promote and suppress tumor progression. Here, we show that the Rho effector protein kinase N2 (PKN2) is critical for PSC myofibroblast differentiation. Loss of PKN2 is associated with reduced PSC proliferation, contractility, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) stress fibers. In spheroid co-cultures with PDAC cells, loss of PKN2 prevents PSC invasion but, counter-intuitively, promotes invasive cancer cell outgrowth. PKN2 deletion induces a myofibroblast to inflammatory CAF switch in the PSC matrisome signature both in vitro and in vivo. Further, deletion of PKN2 in the pancreatic stroma induces more locally invasive, orthotopic pancreatic tumors. Finally, we demonstrate that a PKN2KO matrisome signature predicts poor outcome in pancreatic and other solid human cancers. Our data indicate that suppressing PSC myofibroblast function can limit important stromal tumor-suppressive mechanisms, while promoting a switch to a cancer-supporting CAF phenotype.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of liver cancer with high mortality, which is a prevalent common cancer in the world. Aberrant miRNAs contribute to the progression and development of HCC. Currently, our study demonstrated that miR-4317 was decreased in HCC patient samples tissues and HCC cell lines, which was related to poor clinical features, including tumor size, advanced TNM stage and vascular invasion. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-4317 suppressed cell viability, proliferation, invasion and migration through loss- and gain-of-function experiment in vitro. In addition, miR-4317 inhibited tumor growth in vivo experiment. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that ZNF436 was a direct target of miR-4317. Restoration of ZNF436 reversed the role of miR-4317 on HCC. ZNF436 expression was increased in HCC tissues and cell lines, which was negatively correlated with miR-4317 expression. ZNF436 overexpression obviously promoted the cell proliferation, viability, invasion and migration of HCC cells. ZNF436 mediated the regulatory function of miR-4317 on PI3K/AKT pathway. Overall, our data suggest that miR-4317 is a novel tumor suppressor to suppress HCC progression through PI3K/AKT pathway by targeting ZNF436, and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.

Abstract: Summary
The interaction between chromatin and the nuclear lamina (NL) is intrinsically important to the establishment of three-dimensional chromatin architecture and spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. However, critical regulators involved in this process are poorly understood in plants. Here, we report that Arabidopsis PNET2 and its two homologs are bona fide inner nuclear membrane proteins and integral components of the NL. PNET2s physically interact with the plant nucleoskeleton and engage nucleosome-enriched chromatin at the nuclear periphery. Loss of all three PNET2s leads to severely disrupted growth and development, concomitant activation of abiotic and biotic stress responses, and ultimate lethality in Arabidopsis. The pent2 triple mutant also displays drastic transcriptome changes accompanied by a globally altered chromatin architecture revealed by HiC analysis. Our study identified PNET2 as an inner nuclear membrane (INM) component of the NL, which associates with chromatin and play a critical role in orchestrating gene expression and chromatin organization in plants.

Abstract: Ykt6 has emerged as a key protein involved in a wide array of trafficking events, and has also been implicated in a number of human pathologies, including the progression of several cancers. It is a complex protein that simultaneously exhibits a high degree of structural and functional homology, and yet adopts differing roles in different cellular contexts. Because Ykt6 has been implicated in a variety of vesicle fusion events, we characterized the role of Ykt6 in oogenesis by observing the phenotype of Ykt6 germline clones. Immunofluorescence was used to visualize the expression of membrane proteins, organelles, and vesicular trafficking markers in mutant egg chambers. We find that Ykt6 germline clones have morphological and actin defects affecting both the nurse cells and oocyte, consistent with a role in regulating membrane growth during mid-oogenesis. Additionally, these egg chambers exhibit defects in bicoid and oskar RNA localization, and in the trafficking of Gurken during mid-to-late oogenesis. Finally, we show that Ykt6 mutations result in defects in late endosomal pathways, including endo- and exocytosis. These findings suggest a role for Ykt6 in endosome maturation and in the movement of membranes to and from the cell surface.

Abstract: Summary
The human lung plays vital roles in respiration, host defense, and basic physiology. Recent technological advancements such as single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic lineage tracing have revealed novel cell types and enriched functional properties of existing cell types in lung. The time has come to take a new census. Initiated by members of the NHLBI-funded LungMAP Consortium and aided by experts in the lung biology community, we synthesized current data into a comprehensive and practical cellular census of the lung. Identities of cell types in the normal lung are captured in individual cell cards with delineation of function, markers, developmental lineages, heterogeneity, regenerative potential, disease links, and key experimental tools. This publication will serve as the starting point of a live, up-to-date guide for lung research at https://www.lungmap.net/cell-cards/. We hope that Lung CellCards will promote the community-wide effort to establish, maintain, and restore respiratory health.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a form of stable cell-cycle arrest arising in response to oncogenic stimulation. OIS must be bypassed for transformation, but the mechanisms of OIS establishment and bypass remain poorly understood, especially at the post-transcriptional level. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein UNR/CSDE1 enables OIS in primary mouse keratinocytes. Depletion of CSDE1 leads to senescence bypass, cell immortalization, and tumor formation, indicating that CSDE1 behaves as a tumor suppressor. Unbiased high-throughput analyses uncovered that CSDE1 promotes OIS by two independent molecular mechanisms: enhancement of the stability of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factor mRNAs and repression of Ybx1 mRNA translation. Importantly, depletion of YBX1 from immortal keratinocytes rescues senescence and uncouples proliferation arrest from the SASP, revealing multilayered mechanisms exerted by CSDE1 to coordinate senescence. Our data highlight the relevance of post-transcriptional control in the regulation of senescence.

Abstract: Summary
We concurrently examine the whole genome, transcriptome, methylome, and immune cell infiltrates in baseline tumors from 77 patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 with or without anti-CTLA-4. We show that high tumor mutation burden (TMB), neoantigen load, expression of IFNγ-related genes, programmed death ligand expression, low PSMB8 methylation (therefore high expression), and T cells in the tumor microenvironment are associated with response to immunotherapy. No specific mutation correlates with therapy response. A multivariable model combining the TMB and IFNγ-related gene expression robustly predicts response (89% sensitivity, 53% specificity, area under the curve [AUC], 0.84); tumors with high TMB and a high IFNγ signature show the best response to immunotherapy. This model validates in an independent cohort (80% sensitivity, 59% specificity, AUC, 0.79). Except for a JAK3 loss-of-function mutation, for patients who did not respond as predicted there is no obvious biological mechanism that clearly explained their outlier status, consistent with intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity in response to immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of differentiated cells to tissue damage is a hallmark of many diseases. In slow-turnover tissues, long-lived differentiated cells can re-enter the cell cycle or transdifferentiate to another cell type to promote repair. Here, we show that in a high-turnover tissue, severe damage to the differentiated compartment induces progenitors to transiently acquire a unique transcriptional and morphological postmitotic state. We highlight this in an acute villus injury model in the mouse intestine, where we identified a population of progenitor-derived cells that covered injured villi. These atrophy-induced villus epithelial cells (aVECs) were enriched for fetal markers but were differentiated and lineage committed. We further established a role for aVECs in maintaining barrier integrity through the activation of yes-associated protein (YAP). Notably, loss of YAP activity led to impaired villus regeneration. Thus, we define a key repair mechanism involving the activation of a fetal-like program during injury-induced differentiation, a process we term “adaptive differentiation.”

Abstract: Objective
To explore the effect of CXC chemokine CXCL10 in the mice with diabetic retinopathy (DR).
Methods
DR models were constructed on mice via injection of streptozotocin (STZ). At 3 weeks of STZ, mice were treated with anti-CXCL10 monoclonal antibodies (mAb)/control mAb, and a series of experiments were then conducted at 6 weeks of STZ, including HE staining, western blotting, retinal trypsin digestion, real-time qPCR and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). The corresponding kits were used to detect the activity of oxidative stress markers.
Results
Compared with nondiabetic eyes, DR mice both at 3 and 6 weeks presented the decreases in the total retinal thickness, the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness, and the cells of ganglion cell layer (GCL), with the upregulated CXCL10, pro-inflammatory cytokines and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as the downregulated levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and CAT, especially in those at 6 weeks, which were attenuated by the anti-CXCL10 mAb treatment. Moreover, in comparison with the DR mice, mice in the DR + anti-CXCL10 mAb group gained the significant decrease in the number of acellular capillaries of retina, with up-regulations of Claudin-5 and ZO-1 and down-regulations of VEGF and FGF-2. The DR mice injected with anti-CXCL10 mAb demonstrated alleviated retinal pathology as compared to mice at 3 weeks of STZ.
Conclusion
Anti-CXCL10 mAb could mitigate the retinal pathology of DR mice, with the decreased inflammation and oxidative stress, thus mediating a delay in the development or disease improvement in patients of DR.

Abstract: Humoral immunity plays a defensive role against invading microbes. However, it has been largely overlooked with respect to Aspergillus fumigatus, an airborne fungal pathogen. Previously, we have demonstrated that surfactant protein D (SP-D), a major humoral component in human lung-alveoli, recognizes A. fumigatus conidial surface exposed melanin pigment. Through binding to melanin, SP-D opsonizes conidia, facilitates conidial phagocytosis, and induces the expression of protective pro-inflammatory cytokines in the phagocytic cells. In addition to melanin, SP-D also interacts with galactomannan (GM) and galactosaminogalactan (GAG), the cell wall polysaccharides exposed on germinating conidial surfaces. Therefore, we aimed at unravelling the biological significance of SP-D during the germination process. Here, we demonstrate that SP-D exerts direct fungistatic activity by restricting A. fumigatus hyphal growth. Conidial germination in the presence of SP-D significantly increased the exposure of cell wall polysaccharides chitin, α-1,3-glucan and GAG, and decreased β-1,3-glucan exposure on hyphae, but that of GM was unaltered. Hyphae grown in presence of SP-D showed positive immunolabelling for SP-D. Additionally, SP-D treated hyphae induced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine, but increased IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) and IL-8 (a chemokine) secretion by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), compared to control hyphae. Moreover, germ tube surface modifications due to SP-D treatment resulted in an increased hyphal susceptibility to voriconazole, an antifungal drug. It appears that SP-D exerts its anti-A. fumigatus functions via a range of mechanisms including hyphal growth-restriction, hyphal surface modification, masking of hyphal surface polysaccharides and thus altering hyphal immunostimulatory properties.

Abstract: At present, much more studies have focused on the therapeutic effect of exosome-delivered microRNAs on diseases. Previous study has shown that miR-455-5p is downregulated in ischemic stroke, but little is known about the role of exosome-delivered miR-455-5p in spinal cord ischemia reperfusion (SCIR) injury. Herein, we isolated exosomes from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transfected with lentivirus vectors containing miR-455-5p. SCIR rat model was established after the intrathecal injection of exosomes containing miR-455-5p. The expression level of miR-455-5p was downregulated after SCIR, administration of exosomal miR-455-5p enhanced the level of miR-455-5p in the injured spinal cord. Hind-limb motor function scores indicated that exosomal miR-455-5p improved the recovery of hind-limb function of SCIR rats. HE staining and Nissl staining showed that miR-455-5p enriched exosomes reduced histopathological abnormalities after SCIR. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that exosomes containing miR-455-5p reduced apoptosis of neurons, and activated autophagy in neurons after SCIR. We observed that the expression of Nogo-A, a direct target of miR-455-5p, was decreased in the spinal cord of exosomal miR-455-5p administrated SCIR rats. Targeting relationship between miR-455-5p and Nogo-A was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. In summary, exosomes containing miR-455-5p had the neuroprotective effects on SCIR injury by promoting autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis of neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells rely on phospho-signaling pathways to gain unlimited proliferation potential. Here, we use domain-focused CRISPR screening and identify the nuclear phosphatase SCP4 as a dependency in AML, yet this enzyme is dispensable in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using CRISPR exon scanning and gene complementation assays, we show that the catalytic function of SCP4 is essential in AML. Through mass spectrometry analysis of affinity-purified complexes, we identify the kinase paralogs STK35 and PDIK1L as binding partners and substrates of the SCP4 phosphatase domain. We show that STK35 and PDIK1L function catalytically and redundantly in the same pathway as SCP4 to maintain AML proliferation and to support amino acid biosynthesis and transport. We provide evidence that SCP4 regulates STK35/PDIK1L through two distinct mechanisms: catalytic removal of inhibitory phosphorylation and by promoting kinase stability. Our findings reveal a phosphatase-kinase signaling complex that supports the pathogenesis of AML.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic genomes harbor invading transposable elements that are silenced by PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to maintain genome integrity in animal germ cells. However, whether piRNAs also regulate endogenous gene expression programs remains unclear. Here, we show that C. elegans piRNAs trigger the transcriptional silencing of hundreds of spermatogenic genes during spermatogenesis, promoting sperm differentiation and function. This silencing signal requires piRNA-dependent small RNA biogenesis and loading into downstream nuclear effectors, which correlates with the dynamic reorganization of two distinct perinuclear biomolecular condensates present in germ cells. In addition, the silencing capacity of piRNAs is temporally counteracted by the Argonaute CSR-1, which targets and licenses spermatogenic gene transcription. The spatial and temporal overlap between these opposing small RNA pathways contributes to setting up the timing of the spermatogenic differentiation program. Thus, our work identifies a prominent role for piRNAs as direct regulators of endogenous transcriptional programs during germline development and gamete differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The hexameric Cdc48 ATPase (p97 or VCP in mammals) cooperates with its cofactor Ufd1/Npl4 to extract polyubiquitinated proteins from membranes or macromolecular complexes for degradation by the proteasome. Here, we clarify how the Cdc48 complex unfolds its substrates and translocates polypeptides with branchpoints. The Cdc48 complex recognizes primarily polyubiquitin chains rather than the attached substrate. Cdc48 and Ufd1/Npl4 cooperatively bind the polyubiquitin chain, resulting in the unfolding of one ubiquitin molecule (initiator). Next, the ATPase pulls on the initiator ubiquitin and moves all ubiquitin molecules linked to its C terminus through the central pore of the hexameric double ring, causing transient ubiquitin unfolding. When the ATPase reaches the isopeptide bond of the substrate, it can translocate and unfold both N- and C-terminal segments. Ubiquitins linked to the branchpoint of the initiator dissociate from Ufd1/Npl4 and move outside the central pore, resulting in the release of unfolded, polyubiquitinated substrate from Cdc48.

Abstract: Summary
We performed proteogenomic characterization of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) using paired tumor and adjacent liver tissues from 262 patients. Integrated proteogenomic analyses prioritized genetic aberrations and revealed hallmarks of iCCA pathogenesis. Aflatoxin signature was associated with tumor initiation, proliferation, and immune suppression. Mutation-associated signaling profiles revealed that TP53 and KRAS co-mutations may contribute to iCCA metastasis via the integrin-FAK-SRC pathway. FGFR2 fusions activated the Rho GTPase pathway and could be a potential source of neoantigens. Proteomic profiling identified four patient subgroups (S1–S4) with subgroup-specific biomarkers. These proteomic subgroups had distinct features in prognosis, genetic alterations, microenvironment dysregulation, tumor microbiota composition, and potential therapeutics. SLC16A3 and HKDC1 were further identified as potential prognostic biomarkers associated with metabolic reprogramming of iCCA cells. This study provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians to further identify molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities in iCCA.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, allowing its application in the therapy of different diseases, including articular cartilage injuries, which induce the establishment of a pro-regenerative microenvironment in the injured tissue. Therefore, our objective was to isolate, characterize and differentiate cartilage cells from different joints of New Zealand rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), in order to verify their potential as MSC for future clinical use. For this, cartilage fragments were isolated from the humerus-radio-ulnar joints, humeral scapula, femoro-tibio-patellar, and lame femoris from rabbits. The results showed that the cells were rounded in the center of the plate and fibroblastoids in the periphery. After thawing, the cells did not change their growth time in culture, nor their morphology. The cells showed labeling for mesenchymal stem cell, cytoskeleton, pluripotency and cell proliferation, but not for hematopoiesis markers (CD105+ and CD34-). We also observed that, when induced, they were able to differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells. After application of these cells in nude mice, no tumor growth was observed in spleen, kidney, liver, lung and heart. Therefore, we conclude that cells isolated from the articular cartilage of rabbits present characteristics of MSC with potential for future clinical applications.

Abstract: Anti-tumorous effect of Aloperine (ALO) has been previously found. This study examined the role and the underlying mechanism of ALO in colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC cells were processed by different concentrations of ALO, and subsequently the cell proliferation was detected by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and miR-296-5p expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, the target gene of miR-296-5p was predicted by TargetScan and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expressions of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), apoptosis-related proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers were measured by Western blot. Clone formation assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing and Transwell assays were respectively employed to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. ALO inhibited CRC cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. MiR-296-5p was low-expressed in CRC tissues and cells, and ALO promoted miR-296-5p expression. STAT3 was targeted by miR-296-5p. Up-regulation of miR-296-5p and ALO treatment both suppressed STAT3 expression, inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion as well as the expressions of Bcl-2 and N-cadherin, but promoted apoptosis and expressions of Bax and E-cadherin, which were all reversed by overexpressed STAT3. ALO inhibited CRC cell proliferation, metastasis and EMT but promoted apoptosis via regulating miR-296-5p/STAT3 axis.

Abstract: Background
Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IIRI) is a common clinical event that can cause serious consequences. The study aimed to investigated the effect of VX-765 in IIRI and its mechanism.
Methods
The hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) cell model and IIRI mouse model were generated to examine the in vitro and in vivo effects of VX-765 on IIRI. IIRI was evaluated by histological assessment. ELISA was performed to determine the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, caspase-1, and GSDMD in intestinal tissues as well as the levels of MDA, SOD, CAT, caspase-1, and GSDMD in Caco-2 cells. Relative protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, IL-18, IL-1β, cleaved Caspase1, and GSDMD-N were analyzed by Western blotting. CCK-8 Assay was conducted to determine the optimal concentration of VX-765 for the in vitro studies. Flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were used to assess ROS levels and the mRNA levels of IL-18 and IL-1β, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to examine the subcellular localization of P65 and NLRP3.
Results
VX-765 reduced IIRI-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro, while it decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β as well as the modified Park/Chiu scores. The optimal concentration of VX-765 for the in vitro studies was 10 μM. Moreover, VX-765 inhibited the nuclear translocation of P65, reduced oxidative stress and down-regulated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
Conclusion
VX-765 prevents IIRI presumably by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.

Abstract: Summary
The MYCN oncoprotein drives the development of numerous neuroendocrine and pediatric tumors. Here we show that MYCN interacts with the nuclear RNA exosome, a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease complex, and recruits the exosome to its target genes. In the absence of the exosome, MYCN-directed elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is slow and non-productive on a large group of cell-cycle-regulated genes. During the S phase of MYCN-driven tumor cells, the exosome is required to prevent the accumulation of stalled replication forks and of double-strand breaks close to the transcription start sites. Upon depletion of the exosome, activation of ATM causes recruitment of BRCA1, which stabilizes nuclear mRNA decapping complexes, leading to MYCN-dependent transcription termination. Disruption of mRNA decapping in turn activates ATR, indicating transcription-replication conflicts. We propose that exosome recruitment by MYCN maintains productive transcription elongation during S phase and prevents transcription-replication conflicts to maintain the rapid proliferation of neuroendocrine tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in intestinal enteroendocrine cells (EECs) respond to nutritional, neural, and microbial cues and modulate the release of gut hormones. Here we show that Gpr17, an orphan GPCR, is co-expressed in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-expressing EECs in human and rodent intestinal epithelium. Acute genetic ablation of Gpr17 in intestinal epithelium improves glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Importantly, inducible knockout (iKO) mice and Gpr17 null intestinal organoids respond to glucose or lipid ingestion with increased secretion of GLP-1, but not the other incretin glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). In an in vitro EEC model, overexpression or agonism of Gpr17 reduces voltage-gated calcium currents and decreases cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, and these are two critical factors regulating GLP-1 secretion. Together, our work shows that intestinal Gpr17 signaling functions as an inhibitory pathway for GLP-1 secretion in EECs, suggesting intestinal GPR17 is a potential target for diabetes and obesity intervention.

Abstract: Purpose
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as a pivotal regulatory element in the progression of human cancers. Being an important member of circRNAs, circFOXO3 has been implicated in tumor invasion or metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the molecular mechanism underlying this promoting effect remains an enigma. The present study aims to study the function of circFOXO3 and dissect the relevant intracellular network in the progression and metastasis of NSCLC.
Methods
Quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay and Western blotting were used to quantify the levels of RNAs and proteins respectively. starBase v2.0 and luciferase assay were used to validate the target of circRNAs or miRNAs. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was adopted to examine cell viability. Transwell was used to determine cell invasion and migration. Xenograft model was established to detect tumor growth.
Results
RT-qPCR showed that circFOXO3 was overexpressed in NSCLC cells and tissues. Knockdown of circFOXO3 not only inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro but also suppressed tumor growth in vivo. starBase v2.0 and luciferase assay results collectively suggested that circFOXO3 sponged miR-545-3p and miR-506-3p. Dual-inhibition of circFOXO3 and its target miRNAs suppressed the reduction of cell proliferation, migration and invasion induced by siRNA of circFOXO3 (si-circFOXO3), demonstrating that the effect of circFOXO3 on NSCLC was dependent on sponging miR-545-3p and miR-506-3p. Further bioinformatic analysis and biochemistry experiments revealed that miR-545-3p and miR-506-3p regulated the expression of a family member of high-mobility group box, HMGB3.
Conclusion
Here, we show thatcircFOXO3 in NSCLC promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells, thereby promoting tumor growth. We further find that circFOXO3 sponges miR-545-3p/miR-506-3p that bind to 3′-UTR of HMGB3 mRNA, which constitutes the major network fulfilling the circFOXO3′s promoting effect. Therefore, we proposed that circFOXO3 could be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Protein-coding genes in trypanosomes occur in polycistronic transcription units (PTUs). How RNA polymerase II (Pol II) initiates transcription of PTUs has not been resolved; the current model favors chromatin modifications inducing transcription rather than sequence-specific promoters. Here, we uncover core promoters by functional characterization of Pol II peaks identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Two distinct promoters are located between divergent PTUs, each driving unidirectional transcription. Detailed analysis identifies a 75-bp promoter that is necessary and sufficient to drive full reporter expression and contains functional motifs. Analysis of further promoters suggests transcription initiation is regulated and promoters are either focused or dispersed. In contrast to the previous model of unregulated and promoter-independent transcription initiation, we find that sequence-specific promoters determine the initiation of Pol II transcription of protein-coding genes PTUs. These findings in Trypanosoma brucei suggest that in addition of chromatin modifications, promoter motifs-based regulation of gene expression is deeply conserved among eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of undifferentiated, long-lived, and often quiescent stem cells in the basal compartment is important for homeostasis and regeneration of multiple epithelial tissues, but the molecular mechanisms that coordinately control basal cell fate and stem cell quiescence are elusive. Here, we report an epithelium-intrinsic requirement for Zeb1, a core transcriptional inducer of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, for mammary epithelial ductal side branching and for basal cell regenerative capacity. Our findings uncover an evolutionarily conserved role of Zeb1 in promoting basal cell fate over luminal differentiation. We show that Zeb1 loss results in increased basal cell proliferation at the expense of quiescence and self-renewal. Moreover, Zeb1 cooperates with YAP to activate Axin2 expression, and inhibition of Wnt signaling partially restores stem cell function to Zeb1-deficient basal cells. Thus, Zeb1 is a transcriptional regulator that maintains both basal cell fate and stem cell quiescence, and it functions in part through suppressing Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Pediatric cancers often mimic fetal tissues and express proteins normally silenced postnatally that could serve as immune targets. We developed T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting glypican-2 (GPC2), a fetal antigen expressed on neuroblastoma (NB) and several other solid tumors. CARs engineered using standard designs control NBs with transgenic GPC2 overexpression, but not those expressing clinically relevant GPC2 site density (∼5,000 molecules/cell, range 1–6 × 103). Iterative engineering of transmembrane (TM) and co-stimulatory domains plus overexpression of c-Jun lowered the GPC2-CAR antigen density threshold, enabling potent and durable eradication of NBs expressing clinically relevant GPC2 antigen density, without toxicity. These studies highlight the critical interplay between CAR design and antigen density threshold, demonstrate potent efficacy and safety of a lead GPC2-CAR candidate suitable for clinical testing, and credential oncofetal antigens as a promising class of targets for CAR T cell therapy of solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Spontaneous mutations introduce uncertainty into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control procedures and vaccine development. Here, we perform a spatiotemporal analysis on intra-host single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) in 402 clinical samples from 170 affected individuals, which reveals an increase in genetic diversity over time after symptom onset in individuals. Nonsynonymous mutations are overrepresented in the pool of iSNVs but underrepresented at the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level, suggesting a two-step fitness selection process: a large number of nonsynonymous substitutions are generated in the host (positive selection), and these substitutions tend to be unfixed as SNPs in the population (negative selection). Dynamic iSNV changes in subpopulations with different gender, age, illness severity, and viral shedding time displayed a varied fitness selection process among populations. Our study highlights that iSNVs provide a mutational pool shaping the rapid global evolution of the virus.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed in eukaryotes and are regulated in many biological processes. Although several studies indicate their activity as microRNA (miRNA) and protein sponges, little is known about their ability to directly control mRNA homeostasis. We show that the widely expressed circZNF609 directly interacts with several mRNAs and increases their stability and/or translation by favoring the recruitment of the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1. Particularly, the interaction with CKAP5 mRNA, which interestingly overlaps the back-splicing junction, enhances CKAP5 translation, regulating microtubule function in cancer cells and sustaining cell-cycle progression. Finally, we show that circZNF609 downregulation increases the sensitivity of several cancer cell lines to different microtubule-targeting chemotherapeutic drugs and that locked nucleic acid (LNA) protectors against the pairing region on circZNF609 phenocopy such effects. These data set an example of how the small effects tuned by circZNF609/CKAP5 mRNA interaction might have a potent output in tumor growth and drug response.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial biosensors have diverse applications in metabolic engineering and medicine. Specific and accurate quantification of chemical concentrations allows for adaptive regulation of enzymatic pathways and temporally precise expression of diagnostic reporters. Although biosensors should differentiate structurally similar ligands with distinct biological functions, such specific sensors are rarely found in nature and challenging to create. Using E. coli Nissle 1917, a generally regarded as safe microbe, we characterized two biosensor systems that promiscuously recognize aromatic amino acids or neurochemicals. To improve the sensors’ selectivity and sensitivity, we applied rational protein engineering by identifying and mutagenizing amino acid residues and successfully demonstrated the ligand-specific biosensors for phenylalanine, tyrosine, phenylethylamine, and tyramine. Additionally, our approach revealed insights into the uncharacterized structure of the FeaR regulator, including critical residues in ligand binding. These results lay the groundwork for developing kinetically adaptive microbes for diverse applications. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Small- and intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (KCa2.x and KCa3.1, also called SK and IK) channels are activated exclusively by a Ca2+-calmodulin gating mechanism. Wild-type KCa2.3 channels have a Ca2+ EC50 value of ∼0.3 μM, while the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of wild-type KCa3.1 channels is ∼0.27 μM. Heterozygous genetic mutations of KCa2.3 channels have been associated with Zimmermann-Laband syndrome and idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension, while KCa3.1 channel mutations were reported in hereditary xerocytosis patients. KCa2.3_S436C and KCa2.3_V450L channels with mutations in the S45A/S45B helices exhibited hypersensitivity to Ca2+. The corresponding mutations in KCa3.1 channels also elevated the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity. KCa3.1_S314P, KCa3.1_A322V and KCa3.1_R352H channels with mutations in the HA/HB helices are hypersensitive to Ca2+, whereas KCa2.3 channels with the equivalent mutations are not. The different effects of the equivalent mutations in the HA/HB helices on the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channels may imply distinct modulation of the two channel subtypes by the HA/HB helices. AP14145 reduced the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the hypersensitive mutant KCa2.3 channels, suggesting the potential therapeutic usefulness of negative gating modulators.

Abstract: A common bridge between a linear cytoplasmic signal and broad nuclear regulation is the family of MAP kinases which can translocate to the nucleus upon activation by the cytoplasmic signal. One pathway which functions to activate the ERK family of MAP kinases is the Ras signaling pathway which functions at multiple times and locations during the development of Caenorhabditis elegans including the development of the excretory cell, germ cells, male tail, and vulva. It has been most extensively characterized during the development of the vulva which is formed from the vulval precursor cells (VPCs), a set of six equivalent, epithelial cells designated P3.p – P8.p. Although LIN-1 appears to be a primary target of ERK MAP kinase during vulval development, it is likely that other developmentally important molecules are also regulated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation. The identification of physiological substrates of MAP kinases has been aided by the identification of docking site domains in substrate proteins that contribute to high-affinity interactions with kinases. Our laboratory has identified the C. elegans protein, T08D10.1/NFYA-1, as a potential ERK MAP kinase substrate in this manner, and we have initiated a characterization of its role during Ras-mediated development. T08D10.1 possesses significant homology to the CCAAT-box DNA-binding domain of the vertebrate nuclear transcription factor-Y, alpha (NF-YA) family of proteins. NF-Y proteins act as part of a complex to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes, in particular, genes that function in the G1/S cell cycle transition. T08D10.1/NFYA-1 is predicted to code for a protein containing multiple potential phosphorylation sites for ERK MAP kinase and a D-domain docking site. We demonstrate through biochemical analysis of purified NFYA-1 protein that it can act in vitro as a high affinity substrate for activated ERK MAP kinase. Growth factor activation of the Ras pathway in a tissue culture system has negligible effect on the protein's transactivation potential, however, the DNA-binding activity of the protein is reduced after treatment with activated ERK-MAP kinase. We demonstrate through mutant analysis that nfya-1 acts to inhibit vulval development and functions downstream or in parallel to let-60/ras. Both the NF-Y complex and the Ras signaling pathway play a fundamental role in cell proliferation and oncogenesis and the connection between the two is an important insight into the mechanisms of cell fate specification and cellular response.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant RNA modification that plays critical roles in RNA regulation and cellular function. Global m6A profiling has revealed important aspects of m6A distribution and function, but to date such studies have been restricted to large populations of cells. Here, we develop a method to identify m6A sites transcriptome-wide in single cells. We uncover surprising heterogeneity in the presence and abundance of m6A sites across individual cells and identify differentially methylated mRNAs across the cell cycle. Additionally, we show that cellular subpopulations can be distinguished based on their RNA methylation signatures, independent from gene expression. These studies reveal fundamental features of m6A that have been missed by m6A profiling of bulk cells and suggest the presence of cell-intrinsic mechanisms for m6A deposition.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification confers an essential layer of gene regulation in living organisms, including plants; yet, the underlying mechanisms of its deposition on specific target mRNAs involved in key plant developmental processes are so far unknown. Here, we show that a core component of the rice m6A methyltransferase complex, OsFIP37, is recruited by an RNA-binding protein, OsFIP37-associated protein 1 (OsFAP1), to mediate m6A RNA modification on an auxin biosynthesis gene, OsYUCCA3, during microsporogenesis. This stabilizes OsYUCCA3 mRNA and promotes local auxin biosynthesis in anthers during male meiosis, which is essential for meiotic division and subsequent pollen development in rice. Loss of function of OsFAP1 causes dissociation of OsFIP37 with OsYUCCA3 and the resulting abolished m6A deposition on OsYUCCA3. Our findings reveal that OsFAP1-dependent m6A deposition on OsYUCCA3 by OsFIP37 constitutes a hitherto unknown link between RNA modification and hormonal control of male meiosis in plant reproductive development.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer, and metastasis is widespread decreasing the survival rate. The search for new therapeutic strategies has increased for phytochemicals due to their potential as antioxidants and anticancer properties. Thus, we evaluated the caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and caffeic acid's (CA) anticancer properties on UMR-106 murine osteosarcoma cells. The IC25 and IC50 were 1.3 and 2.7 μM for CAPE and 91.0 and 120.0 μM for CA, respectively. This study shows the potential anticancer properties of CAPE and highlights how a phenethyl ester component addition can improve the pharmacological potency in relation to its precursor CA. Our results showed that CAPE was more efficient and selective in reducing the viability of tumor cells compared to the control osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) (p < 0.05). In addition, CAPE was 44-fold (IC25) and 70-fold (IC50) more cytotoxic than CA. CAPE also decreased ROS generation and cell migration. In summary, CAPE was more selective for tumor cells, preserving normal ones, suggesting its potential role as an anticancer drug.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated homeostasis of neural activity has been hypothesized to drive Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. AD begins with a decades-long presymptomatic phase, but whether homeostatic mechanisms already begin failing during this silent phase is unknown. We show that before the onset of memory decline and sleep disturbances, familial AD (fAD) model mice display no deficits in CA1 mean firing rate (MFR) during active wakefulness. However, homeostatic down-regulation of CA1 MFR is disrupted during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and general anesthesia in fAD mouse models. The resultant hyperexcitability is attenuated by the mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme inhibitor, which tunes MFR toward lower set-point values. Ex vivo fAD mutations impair downward MFR homeostasis, resulting in pathological MFR set points in response to anesthetic drug and inhibition blockade. Thus, firing rate dyshomeostasis of hippocampal circuits is masked during active wakefulness but surfaces during low-arousal brain states, representing an early failure of the silent disease stage.

Abstract: Summary
Cx3cr1CreER-driven Cre recombinase (Cre) is a widely used genetic tool for enabling gene manipulation in microglia and macrophages. However, an in-depth analysis of the possible detrimental effects of Cre activity in microglia, surprisingly, remains missing. Here, we demonstrate an age-dependent sensitivity of microglia to Cx3cr1-Cre toxicity, wherein Cre induction, specifically in early postnatal microglia, is detrimental to microglial development, proliferation, and function. Tamoxifen (TAM)-induced Cre activity leads to microglial activation, type 1 interferon (IFN-1) signaling, and increased phagocytosis, causing aberrant synaptic pruning during the early postnatal period and anxious behavior at later age. The detrimental effects of Cre induction are caused by DNA-damage-induced toxicity in microglia and are limited to the early postnatal period, showing no detrimental effects in adult microglia. Thus, our study reveals an age-dependent vulnerability of microglia to Cre activity, thereby highlighting age dependency of Cre action, which could be especially applicable in the broader context of environment-responsive cell types.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional co-activator YAP1 oncogene is the downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, which regulates tissue homeostasis, organ size, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Multiple cancers are dependent on sustained expression of YAP1 for cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis, but the molecular basis of this oncogene dependency is not well understood. To identify genes that can functionally substitute for YAP1, we performed a genome-scale genetic rescue screen in YAP1-dependent colon cancer cells expressing an inducible YAP1-specific shRNA. We found that the transcription factor PRDM14 rescued cell proliferation and tumorigenesis upon YAP1 suppression in YAP1-dependent cells, xenografts, and colon cancer organoids. YAP1 and PRDM14 individually activated the transcription of calmodulin 2 (CALM2) and a glucose transporter SLC2A1 upon YAP1 suppression, and CALM2 or SLC2A1 expression was required for the rescue of YAP1 suppression. Together, these findings implicate PRDM14-mediated transcriptional upregulation of CALM2 and SLC2A1 as key components of oncogenic YAP1 signaling and dependency.

Abstract: Summary
Tubulin dimers assemble into dynamic microtubules, which are used by molecular motors as tracks for intracellular transport. Organization and dynamics of the microtubule network are commonly thought to be regulated at the polymer ends, where tubulin dimers can be added or removed. Here, we show that molecular motors running on microtubules cause exchange of dimers along the shaft in vitro and in cells. These sites of dimer exchange act as rescue sites where depolymerizing microtubules stop shrinking and start re-growing. Consequently, the average length of microtubules increases depending on how frequently they are used as motor tracks. An increase of motor activity densifies the cellular microtubule network and enhances cell polarity. Running motors leave marks in the shaft, serving as traces of microtubule usage to organize the polarity landscape of the cell.

Abstract: Phytophthora infestans, causal agent of late blight in potato and tomato, remains challenging to control. Unravelling its biomechanics of host invasion, and its response to mechanical and chemical stress, could provide new handles to combat this devastating pathogen. Here we introduce two fluorescent molecular sensors, CWP-BDP and NR12S, that reveal the micromechanical response of the cell wall-plasma membrane continuum in P. infestans during invasive growth and upon chemical treatment. When visualized by live-cell imaging, CWP-BDP reports changes in cell wall (CW) porosity while NR12S reports variations in chemical polarity and lipid order in the plasma membrane (PM). During invasive growth, mechanical interactions between the pathogen and a surface reveal clear and localized changes in the structure of the CW. Moreover, the molecular sensors can reveal the effect of chemical treatment to CW and/or PM, thereby revealing the site-of-action of crop protection agents. This mechano-chemical imaging strategy resolves, non-invasively and with high spatio-temporal resolution, how the CW-PM continuum adapts and responds to abiotic stress, and provides information on the dynamics and location of cellular stress responses for which, to date, no other methods are available.

Abstract: Summary
Bacillus subtilis spores are encased in two concentric shells: an outer proteinaceous “coat” and an inner peptidoglycan “cortex,” separated by a membrane. Cortex assembly depends on coat assembly initiation, but how cells achieve this coordination across the membrane is unclear. Here, we report that the protein SpoVID monitors the polymerization state of the coat basement layer via an extension to a functional intracellular LysM domain that arrests sporulation when coat assembly is initiated improperly. Whereas extracellular LysM domains bind mature peptidoglycan, SpoVID LysM binds to the membrane-bound lipid II peptidoglycan precursor. We propose that improper coat assembly exposes the SpoVID LysM domain, which then sequesters lipid II and prevents cortex assembly. SpoVID defines a widespread group of firmicute proteins with a characteristic N-terminal domain and C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domains that might combine coat and cortex assembly roles to mediate a developmental checkpoint linking the morphogenesis of two spatially separated supramolecular structures.

Abstract: Summary
Niches maintain a finite pool of stem cells via restricted space and short-range signals. Stem cells compete for limited niche resources, but the mechanisms regulating competition are poorly understood. Using the Drosophila testis model, we show that germline stem cells (GSCs) lacking the transcription factor Chinmo gain a competitive advantage for niche access. Surprisingly, chinmo−/− GSCs rely on a new mechanism of competition in which they secrete the extracellular matrix protein Perlecan to selectively evict non-mutant GSCs and then upregulate Perlecan-binding proteins to remain in the altered niche. Over time, the GSC pool can be entirely replaced with chinmo−/− cells. As a consequence, the mutant chinmo allele acts as a gene drive element; the majority of offspring inherit the allele despite the heterozygous genotype of the parent. Our results suggest that the influence of GSC competition may extend beyond individual stem cell niche dynamics to population-level allelic drift and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Neurodevelopmental cognitive disorders provide insights into mechanisms of human brain development. Here, we report an intellectual disability syndrome caused by the loss of APC7, a core component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex (APC). In mechanistic studies, we uncover a critical role for APC7 during the recruitment and ubiquitination of APC substrates. In proteomics analyses of the brain from mice harboring the patient-specific APC7 mutation, we identify the chromatin-associated protein Ki-67 as an APC7-dependent substrate of the APC in neurons. Conditional knockout of the APC coactivator protein Cdh1, but not Cdc20, leads to the accumulation of Ki-67 protein in neurons in vivo, suggesting that APC7 is required for the function of Cdh1-APC in the brain. Deregulated neuronal Ki-67 upon APC7 loss localizes predominantly to constitutive heterochromatin. Our findings define an essential function for APC7 and Cdh1-APC in neuronal heterochromatin regulation, with implications for understanding human brain development and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) suppress the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, thereby contributing to tumor immune evasion. Here, we report that the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) co-localizes with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the exosomes; both ICAM-1 and PD-L1 are upregulated by interferon-γ. Exosomal ICAM-1 interacts with LFA-1, which is upregulated in activated T cells. Blocking ICAM-1 on TEVs reduces the interaction of TEVs with CD8+ T cells and attenuates PD-L1-mediated suppressive effects of TEVs. During this study, we have established an extracellular vesicle-target cell interaction detection through SorTagging (ETIDS) system to assess the interaction between a TEV ligand and its target cell receptor. Using this system, we demonstrate that the interaction of TEV PD-L1 with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) on T cells is significantly reduced in the absence of ICAM-1. Our study demonstrates that ICAM-1-LFA-1-mediated adhesion between TEVs and T cells is a prerequisite for exosomal PD-L1-mediated immune suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Gene silencing by heterochromatin plays a crucial role in cell identity. Here, we characterize the localization, the biogenesis, and the function of an atypical heterochromatin, which is simultaneously enriched in the typical H3K9me3 mark and in H3K36me3, a histone mark usually associated with gene expression. We identified thousands of dual regions in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that rely on the histone methyltransferases SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) and nuclear set domain (NSD)-containing proteins to generate H3K9me3 and H3K36me3, respectively. Upon SETDB1 removal, dual domains lose both marks, gain signatures of active enhancers, and come into contact with upregulated genes, suggesting that it might be an important pathway by which genes are controlled by heterochromatin. In differentiated tissues, a subset of these dual domains is destabilized and becomes enriched in active enhancer marks, providing a mechanistic insight into the involvement of heterochromatin in the maintenance of cell identity.

Abstract: Cytokines of interleukin-6 (IL-6) family are important signaling proteins involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Earlier, we described interactions between IL-11 and S100P/B proteins from the family of S100 proteins engaged in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. We probed here interactions between seven IL-6 family cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, OSM, LIF, CNTF, CT-1, and CLCF1) and fourteen S100 proteins (S100A1/A4/A6/A7/A8/A9/A10/A11/A12/A13/A14/A15/B/P). Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy revealed formation of calcium-dependent complexes between IL-11, OSM, CNTF, CT-1, and CLCF1 and distinct subsets of S100A1/A6/B/P proteins with equilibrium dissociation constants of 19 nM – 12 µM. The existence of a network of interactions between Ca2+-loaded S100 proteins and IL-6 family cytokines suggest regulation of these cytokines by the extracellular forms of S100 proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial polarity is controlled by a polarity machinery that includes Rho GTPase CDC42 and Scribble/PAR. By using intestinal stem cell (ISC)-specific deletion of CDC42 in olfactomedin-4 (Olfm4)-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-EGFP/CreERT2;CDC42flox/flox mice, we find that CDC42 loss initiated in the ISCs causes a drastic hyperproliferation of transit amplifying (TA) cells and disrupts epithelial polarity. CDC42-null crypts display expanded TA cell and diminished ISC populations, accompanied by elevated Hippo signaling via YAP/TAZ-Ereg (yes-associated protein/WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1-epiregulin) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, independent from canonical Wnt signaling. YAP/TAZ conditional knockout (KO) restores the balance of ISC/TA cell populations and crypt proliferation but does not rescue the polarity in CDC42-null small intestine. mTOR or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor treatment of CDC42 KO mice exhibits similar rescuing effects without affecting YAP/TAZ signaling. Inducible ablation of Scribble in intestinal epithelial cells mimics that of CDC42 KO defects, including crypt hyperplasia and Hippo signaling activation. Mammalian epithelial polarity regulates ISC/TA cell fate and proliferation via a Hippo-Ereg-mTOR cascade.

Abstract: Imperatorin, an active natural furocoumarin, exerts a wide range of biological activities. In the present study, the therapeutic effects of imperatorin on cardiac function and remodelling and the possible underlying mechanisms involved in high-fat/high-fructose diet (HFFD)-fed rats were investigated. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet plus 15 % fructose in drinking water for 16 weeks. HFFD-fed rats were treated with imperatorin (15 or 30 mg/kg/day) for the last 4 weeks. Treatment of HFFD-fed rats with imperatorin significantly reduced dyslipidaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, and hypertension. Imperatorin markedly alleviated HFFD-induced cardiac morphology alterations and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Imperatorin also significantly decreased malondialdehyde concentration and increased catalase activity in plasma and cardiac tissue. Additionally, decreased plasma tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 concentrations, together with restoration of cardiac nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) protein expression, were also observed after treatment with imperatorin. These findings indicated that imperatorin alleviates HFFD-induced cardiac remodelling and LV dysfunction in rats. The possible underlying mechanism may involve the reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation, and the restoration of Nrf-2 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Characterization of COVID-19 antibodies has largely focused on memory B cells; however, it is the antibody-secreting plasma cells that are directly responsible for the production of serum antibodies, which play a critical role in resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection. Little is known about the specificity of plasma cells, largely because plasma cells lack surface antibody expression, thereby complicating their screening. Here, we describe a technology pipeline that integrates single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing and mammalian display to interrogate the specificity of plasma cells from 16 convalescent patients. Single-cell sequencing allows us to profile antibody repertoire features and identify expanded clonal lineages. Mammalian display screening is used to reveal that 43 antibodies (of 132 candidates) derived from expanded plasma cell lineages are specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including antibodies with high affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) that exhibit potent neutralization and broad binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variants (of concern/interest).

Abstract: Summary
The late-acting endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery has been implicated in facilitating the resealing of the nuclear envelope (NE) after mitosis, enabling compartmentalization of the genome away from the cytoplasm. Here, we leverage the stereotypic first division of the C. elegans embryo to identify additional functions of the ESCRT machinery in maintaining the structure of the inner nuclear membrane. Specifically, impaired ESCRT function results in a defect in the pruning of inner nuclear membrane invaginations, which arise normally during NE reformation and expansion. Additionally, in combination with a hypomorphic mutation that interferes with assembly of the underlying nuclear lamina, inhibition of ESCRT function significantly perturbs NE architecture and increases chromosome segregation defects, resulting in penetrant embryonic lethality. Our findings highlight links between ESCRT-mediated inner nuclear membrane remodeling, maintenance of nuclear envelope morphology, and the preservation of the genome during early development.

Abstract: Summary
In a recent issue of Cell Reports, Morelli et al. (2021) identify a subpopulation of mechanosensitive peripheral sensory neurons that coexpress tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC) and innervate cutaneous arterioles. They show that activation of TrkC sensory neurons causes cutaneous vasoconstriction and, most remarkably, that their lesion is associated with sudden death of an undetermined cause, preceded by a progressive drop in blood pressure, and conclude that TrkC+ TH+ neurons represent a baroreceptor class of homeostatic enteroceptor. This represents a radical departure from current consensus models for the central control of blood pressure. Here, we offer an alternative perspective on their findings and suggest priorities for further investigation. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Morelli et al. (2021), published in Cell Reports. See also the response by Heppenstall et al. (2022), published in this issue.

Abstract: As a principal matrisomal protein, collagen is involved in the regulation of the structural framework of extracellular matrix (ECM) and therefore is potentially crucial in determining the biophysical character of the ECM. It has been suggested that collagen architecture plays a role in ovarian cancer development, progression and therapeutic responses which led us to examine the collagen morphology in normal and cancerous ovarian tissue. Also, the behaviour of ovarian cancer cells cultured in four qualitatively different collagen gels was investigated. The results here provide evidence that collagen I morphology in the cancerous ovary is distinct from that in the normal ovary. Tumour-associated collagen I showed streams or channels of thick elongated collagen I fibrils. Moreover, fibril alignment was significantly more prevalent in endometrioid and clear cell cancers than other ovarian cancer subtypes. In this work, for the first-time collagen I architecture profiling (CAP) was introduced using histochemical staining, which distinguished between the collagen I morphologies of ovarian cancer subtypes. Immunohistochemical examination of ovarian normal and cancerous tissues also supported the notion that focal adhesion and Rho signalling are upregulated in ovarian cancers, especially in the high-grade serous tumours, as indicated by higher expression of p-FAK and p190RhoGEF. The results also support the concept that collagen I architecture, which might be collagen I concentration-dependent, influences proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. The study provides evidence that modification of collagen I architecture integrity is associated with ovarian cancer development and therapeutic responses.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the primary cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia with rates of penicillin and multidrug-resistance exceeding 80% and 40%, respectively. The innate immune response generates a variety of antimicrobial agents to control infection, including zinc stress. Here, we characterize the impact of zinc intoxication on S. pneumoniae, observing disruptions in central carbon metabolism, lipid biogenesis, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Characterization of the pivotal peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme GlmU indicates a sensitivity to zinc inhibition. Disruption of the sole zinc efflux pathway, czcD, renders S. pneumoniae highly susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics. To dysregulate zinc homeostasis in the wild-type strain, we investigated the safe-for-human-use ionophore 5,7-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]quinolin-8-ol (PBT2). PBT2 rendered wild-type S. pneumoniae strains sensitive to a range of antibiotics. Using an invasive ampicillin-resistant strain, we demonstrate in a murine pneumonia infection model the efficacy of PBT2 + ampicillin treatment. These findings present a therapeutic modality to break antibiotic resistance in multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamus regulates many innate behaviors, but its development remains poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to profile multiple stages of early hypothalamic development in the chick. Hypothalamic neuroepithelial cells are initially induced from prethalamic-like cells. Two distinct hypothalamic progenitor populations then emerge and give rise to tuberal and mammillary/paraventricular hypothalamic cells. At later stages, the regional organization of the chick and mouse hypothalamus is highly similar. We identify selective markers for major subdivisions of the developing chick hypothalamus and many previously uncharacterized candidate regulators of hypothalamic induction, regionalization, and neurogenesis. As proof of concept for the power of the dataset, we demonstrate that prethalamus-derived follistatin inhibits hypothalamic induction. This study clarifies the organization of the nascent hypothalamus and identifies molecular mechanisms that may control its induction and subsequent development.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding and predicting the functional consequences of single amino acid changes is central in many areas of protein science. Here, we collect and analyze experimental measurements of effects of >150,000 variants in 29 proteins. We use biophysical calculations to predict changes in stability for each variant and assess them in light of sequence conservation. We find that the sequence analyses give more accurate prediction of variant effects than predictions of stability and that about half of the variants that show loss of function do so due to stability effects. We construct a machine learning model to predict variant effects from protein structure and sequence alignments and show how the two sources of information support one another and enable mechanistic interpretations. Together, our results show how one can leverage large-scale experimental assessments of variant effects to gain deeper and general insights into the mechanisms that cause loss of function.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are known to mediate anti-helminth responses, but it remains uncertain which subsets are involved or how macrophages actually kill helminths. Here, we show rapid monocyte recruitment to the lung after infection with the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. In this inflamed tissue microenvironment, these monocytes differentiate into an alveolar macrophage (AM)-like phenotype, expressing both SiglecF and CD11c, surround invading parasitic larvae, and preferentially kill parasites in vitro. Monocyte-derived AMs (Mo-AMs) express type 2-associated markers and show a distinct remodeling of the chromatin landscape relative to tissue-derived AMs (TD-AMs). In particular, they express high amounts of arginase-1 (Arg1), which we demonstrate mediates helminth killing through L-arginine depletion. These studies indicate that recruited monocytes are selectively programmed in the pulmonary environment to express AM markers and an anti-helminth phenotype.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important mediators to human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) phenotype remodeling and airway diseases. MicroRNA-10b-5p (miR-10b-5p) has been extensively studied in different fields. This study set out to probe into the effect of miR-10b-5p in cyclic mechanical stretch-induced apoptosis in HASMCs. The results showed that after 15 % deformation, 0.5 s stretching and 0.5 s cyclic mechanical stretching relaxation (0.5 Hz) occurred to HASMCs, miR-10b-5p showed up-regulation without inducing significant apoptosis. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expressions of FLT1 were reduced. Then, dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that FLT1 was targeted by miR-10b-5p, and miR-10b-5p silencing increased FLT1 expression, leading to a prolonged arrest of stretch-treated HASMCs at the G1/S stage, and increased cell apoptosis compared with control group. Furthermore, the activity of Caspase-3 was reinforced, and the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax was markedly reduced after miR-10b-5p silencing. The current study proved that expression levels of p-PI3K and p-Akt in stretch-treated HASMCs of the inhibition group were significantly inhibited in comparison to those of the controls. The effects of miR-10b-5p overexpression are opposite to that of inhibition of miR-10b-5p in stretched HASMCs. In conclusion, this study showed that miR-10b-5p silencing could weaken the hypertrophy of HASMCs. MiR-10b-5p negatively regulated FLT1 expression, but positively regulated the PI3K/Akt pathway in HASMCs. By referring to other previous studies, we concluded that miR-10b-5p might be a potent target in the treatment of airway diseases.

Abstract: Calcium is one of the most important second messengers in cells. The uptake and release of calcium ions are conducted by channels and transporters. Inside a eukaryotic cell, calcium is stored in intracellular organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondrion, and lysosome. Lysosomes are acid membrane-bounded organelles serving as the crucial degradation and recycling center of the cell. Lysosomes involve in multiple important signaling events, including nutrient sensing, lipid metabolism, and trafficking. Hitherto, two lysosomal cation channel families have been suggested to function as calcium release channels, namely the Two-pore Channel (TPC) family, and the Transient Receptor Potential Channel Mucolipin (TRPML) family. Additionally, a few plasma membrane calcium channels have also been found in the lysosomal membrane under certain circumstances. In this review, we will discuss the structural mechanism of the cation channels that may be important for lysosomal calcium release, primarily focusing on the TPCs and TRPMLs.

Abstract: Msx1 is essential for the maintenance of the odontogenic fate of dental mesenchymal cells, and is regulated by BMP/Smad1/5 signaling in a Smad4-independent manner. However, the exact co-factors that assist pSmad1/5 entering the nucleus to regulate Msx1 in dental mesenchymal cells are still unknown. Importin7 (IPO7) is one of the important members of importin β-superfamily, which is mainly responsible for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of RNAs and proteins, including transcription factors. This study aims to investigate whether IPO7 participates in the nuclear translocation of pSmad1/5 activated by BMP4 to regulate Msx1 expression in mouse dental mesenchymal cells. In the current study, we found that IPO7 was strongly expressed in the mouse dental mesenchymal cells at postnatal day 1 (PN1) both in vitro and in vivo. With BMP4 stimulation, IPO7 showed a translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Knockdown of IPO7 with siRNA inhibited the nuclear accumulation of pSmad1/5 in response to BMP4 stimulation. Furthermore, the co-immunoprecipitation assay showed pSmad1/5 was a nuclear import cargo of IPO7. Next, knockdown of IPO7 abolished the upregulation of Msx1 induced by BMP4, while overexpression of Smad1 was able to rescue the Msx1 expression. Finally, ChIP and Re-ChIP assay showed IPO7 facilitated the recruitment of pSmad1/5 to the Msx1 promoter. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the regulation of Msx1 by BMP4/pSmad1/5 signaling is mediated by importin7 in mouse dental mesenchymal cells.
