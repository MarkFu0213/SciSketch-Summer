Abstract: Summary
Highly specific expression patterns can be caused by the overlapping activities of activator and repressor sequences in enhancers. However, few studies illuminate how these sequences evolve in the origin of new enhancers. Here, we show that expression of the bond gene in the semicircular wall epithelium (swe) of the Drosophila melanogaster male ejaculatory bulb (EB) is controlled by an enhancer consisting of an activator region that requires Abdominal-B driving expression in the entire EB and a repressor region that restricts this expression to the EB swe. Although this expression pattern is independently gained in the distantly related Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis and does not require Abdominal-B, we show that functionally similar repressor sequences are present in Scaptodrosophila and also in species that do not express bond in the EB. We suggest that during enhancer evolution, repressor sequences can precede the evolution of activator sequences and may lead to similar but independently evolved expression patterns.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) impede antitumor immunity; however, the precise mechanisms that regulate their suppressive function remain unresolved. Identifying these mechanisms could lead to therapeutic interventions to boost cancer immunotherapy efficacy. Here, we reveal that β2 adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) expression on MDSCs increases with tumor growth and that the β2-AR stress pathway drives the immune suppressive activity of MDSCs by altering their metabolism. We show that β2-AR signaling decreases glycolysis and increases oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). It also increases expression of the fatty acid transporter CPT1A, which is necessary for the FAO-mediated immunosuppressive function of MDSCs. Moreover, we show that β2-AR signaling increases autophagy and activates the arachidonic acid cycle, both required for increasing the release of the immunosuppressive mediator, PGE2. Our data reveal that β2-AR signaling triggered by stress is an important physiological regulator of key metabolic pathways in MDSCs, driving their immunosuppressive function.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of haplotype reference panels and whole-genome sequencing resources specific to the Chinese population has greatly hindered genetic studies in the world’s largest population. Here, we present the NyuWa genome resource, based on deep (26.2×) sequencing of 2,999 Chinese individuals, and construct a NyuWa reference panel of 5,804 haplotypes and 19.3 million variants, which is a high-quality publicly available Chinese population-specific reference panel with thousands of samples. Compared with other panels, the NyuWa reference panel reduces the Han Chinese imputation error rate by a margin ranging from 30% to 51%. Population structure and imputation simulation tests support the applicability of one integrated reference panel for northern and southern Chinese. In addition, a total of 22,504 loss-of-function variants in coding and noncoding genes are identified, including 11,493 novel variants. These results highlight the value of the NyuWa genome resource in facilitating genetic research in Chinese and Asian populations.

Abstract: Summary
Protection of peri-centromeric (periCEN) REC8 cohesin from Separase and sister kinetochore (KT) attachment to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole (co-orientation) ensures that sister chromatids remain associated after meiosis I. Both features are lost during meiosis II, resulting in sister chromatid disjunction and the production of haploid gametes. By transferring spindle-chromosome complexes (SCCs) between meiosis I and II in mouse oocytes, we discovered that both sister KT co-orientation and periCEN cohesin protection depend on the SCC, and not the cytoplasm. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Separase at meiosis I is necessary not only for converting KTs from a co- to a bi-oriented state but also for deprotection of periCEN cohesion, and cleavage of REC8 may be the key event. Crucially, selective cleavage of REC8 in the vicinity of KTs is sufficient to destroy co-orientation in univalent chromosomes, albeit not in bivalents where resolution of chiasmata may also be required

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for immunological tolerance and immune homeostasis. Treg cells strongly rely on mitochondrial metabolism and show a lower level of glycolysis. However, little is known about the role of lipid metabolism in the regulation of Treg cell homeostasis. Some members of the ACSL family of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthases are expressed in T cells, but their function remains unclear. A combination of RNA-sequencing and proteome analyses shows that Acsbg1, a member of ACSL, is selectively expressed in Treg cells. We show that the genetic deletion of Acsbg1 not only causes mitochondrial dysfunction, but it also dampens other metabolic pathways. The extrinsic supplementation of Acsbg1-deficient Treg cells with oleoyl-CoA restores the phenotype of the Treg metabolic signature. Furthermore, this pathway in ST2+ effector Treg cells enhances immunosuppressive capacity in airway inflammation. Thus, Acsbg1 serves as a metabolic checkpoint governing Treg cell homeostasis and the resolution of lung inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism producing distinct mRNA molecules from a single pre-mRNA with a prominent role in the development and function of the central nervous system. We used long-read isoform sequencing to generate full-length transcript sequences in the human and mouse cortex. We identify novel transcripts not present in existing genome annotations, including transcripts mapping to putative novel (unannotated) genes and fusion transcripts incorporating exons from multiple genes. Global patterns of transcript diversity are similar between human and mouse cortex, although certain genes are characterized by striking differences between species. We also identify developmental changes in alternative splicing, with differential transcript usage between human fetal and adult cortex. Our data confirm the importance of alternative splicing in the cortex, dramatically increasing transcriptional diversity and representing an important mechanism underpinning gene regulation in the brain. We provide transcript-level data for human and mouse cortex as a resource to the scientific community.

Abstract: Summary
Plants exhibit high regenerative capacity, which is controlled by various genetic factors. Here, we report that ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2) controls de novo shoot organogenesis by regulating auxin-cytokinin interaction. The auxin-inducible ATXR2 Trithorax Group (TrxG) protein temporally interacts with the cytokinin-responsive type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 1 (ARR1) at early stages of shoot regeneration. The ATXR2-ARR1 complex binds to and deposits the H3K36me3 mark in the promoters of a subset of type-A ARR genes, ARR5 and ARR7, thus activating their expression. Consequently, the ATXR2/ARR1-type-A ARR module transiently represses cytokinin signaling and thereby de novo shoot regeneration. The atxr2-1 mutant calli exhibit enhanced shoot regeneration with low expression of ARR5 and ARR7, which ultimately upregulates WUSCHEL (WUS) expression. Thus, ATXR2 regulates cytokinin signaling and prevents premature WUS activation to ensure proper cell fate transition, and the auxin-cytokinin interaction underlies the initial specification of shoot meristem in callus.

Abstract: Summary
Motile cilia defects impair cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and can cause brain and spine disorders. The development of ciliated cells, their impact on CSF flow, and their function in brain and axial morphogenesis are not fully understood. We have characterized motile ciliated cells within the zebrafish brain ventricles. We show that the ventricles undergo restructuring through development, involving a transition from mono- to multiciliated cells (MCCs) driven by gmnc. MCCs co-exist with monociliated cells and generate directional flow patterns. These ciliated cells have different developmental origins and are genetically heterogenous with respect to expression of the Foxj1 family of ciliary master regulators. Finally, we show that cilia loss from the tela choroida and choroid plexus or global perturbation of multiciliation does not affect overall brain or spine morphogenesis but results in enlarged ventricles. Our findings establish that motile ciliated cells are generated by complementary and sequential transcriptional programs to support ventricular development.

Abstract: Summary
Electrical synapses are established between specific neurons and within distinct subcellular compartments, but the mechanisms that direct gap junction assembly in the nervous system are largely unknown. Here, we show that a developmental program tunes cAMP signaling to direct the neuron-specific assembly and placement of electrical synapses in the C. elegans motor circuit. We use live-cell imaging to visualize electrical synapses in vivo and an optogenetic assay to confirm that they are functional. In ventral A class (VA) motor neurons, the UNC-4 transcription factor blocks expression of cAMP antagonists that promote gap junction miswiring. In unc-4 mutants, VA electrical synapses are established with an alternative synaptic partner and are repositioned from the VA axon to soma. cAMP counters these effects by driving gap junction trafficking into the VA axon for electrical synapse assembly. Thus, our experiments establish that cAMP regulates gap junction trafficking for the biogenesis of functional electrical synapses.

Abstract: Summary
Polyamines are small, organic polycations that are ubiquitous and essential to all forms of life. Currently, how polyamines are transported across membranes is not understood. Recent studies have suggested that ATP13A2 and its close homologs, collectively known as P5B-ATPases, are polyamine transporters at endo-/lysosomes. Loss-of-function mutations of ATP13A2 in humans cause hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease. To understand the polyamine transport mechanism of ATP13A2, we determined high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human ATP13A2 in five distinct conformational intermediates, which together, represent a near-complete transport cycle of ATP13A2. The structural basis of the polyamine specificity was revealed by an endogenous polyamine molecule bound to a narrow, elongated cavity within the transmembrane domain. The structures show an atypical transport path for a water-soluble substrate, in which polyamines may exit within the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane. Our study provides important mechanistic insights into polyamine transport and a framework to understand the functions and mechanisms of P5B-ATPases.

Abstract: Summary
Sex disparities in cardiac homeostasis and heart disease are well documented, with differences attributed to actions of sex hormones. However, studies have indicated sex chromosomes act outside of the gonads to function without mediation by gonadal hormones. Here, we performed transcriptional and proteomics profiling to define differences between male and female mouse hearts. We demonstrate, contrary to current dogma, cardiac sex disparities are controlled not only by sex hormones but also through a sex-chromosome mechanism. Using Turner syndrome (XO) and Klinefelter (XXY) models, we find the sex-chromosome pathway is established by X-linked gene dosage. We demonstrate cardiac sex disparities occur at the earliest stages of heart formation, a period before gonad formation. Using these datasets, we identify and define a role for alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG), showing loss of A1BG leads to cardiac defects in females, but not males. These studies provide resources for studying sex-biased cardiac disease states.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer is classified into multiple distinct histologic types, and many of the rarer types have limited characterization. Here, we extend The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Cancer (TCGA-BRCA) dataset with additional histologic type annotations in a total of 1,063 breast cancers. We analyze this extended dataset to define transcriptomic and genomic profiles of six rare, special histologic types: cribriform, micropapillary, mucinous, papillary, metaplastic, and invasive carcinoma with medullary pattern. We show the broader applicability of our constructed special histologic type gene signatures in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas dataset with a predictive model that detects mucinous histologic type across cancers of other organ systems. Using a normal mammary cell differentiation score analysis, we order histologic types into a continuum from stem cell-like to luminal progenitor-like to mature luminal-like. Finally, we classify TCGA-BRCA into 12 consensus groups based on integrated genomic and histological features. We present a rich, openly accessible resource of genomic, molecular, and histologic characterization of TCGA-BRCA to enable studies across the range of breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Acetyl ligation to the amino acids in a protein is an important posttranslational modification. However, in contrast to lysine acetylation, N-terminal acetylation is elusive in terms of its cellular functions. Here, we identify Nat3 as an N-terminal acetyltransferase essential for autophagy, a catabolic pathway for bulk transport and degradation of cytoplasmic components. We identify the actin cytoskeleton constituent Act1 and dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 (vacuolar protein sorting 1) as substrates for Nat3-mediated N-terminal acetylation of the first methionine. Acetylated Act1 forms actin filaments and therefore promotes the transport of Atg9 vesicles for autophagosome formation; acetylated Vps1 recruits and facilitates bundling of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor) complex for autophagosome fusion with vacuoles. Abolishment of the N-terminal acetylation of Act1 and Vps1 is associated with blockage of upstream and downstream steps of the autophagy process. Therefore, our work shows that protein N-terminal acetylation plays a critical role in controlling autophagy by fine-tuning multiple steps in the process.

Abstract: Summary
Swallowing is an essential step of eating and drinking. However, how the quality of a food bolus is sensed by pharyngeal neurons is largely unknown. Here we find that mechanical receptors along the Drosophila pharynx are required for control of meal size, especially for food of high viscosity. The mechanical force exerted by the bolus passing across the pharynx is detected by neurons expressing the mechanotransduction channel NOMPC (no mechanoreceptor potential C) and is relayed, together with gustatory information, to IN1 neurons in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the brain. IN1 (ingestion neurons) neurons act directly upstream of a group of peptidergic neurons that encode satiety. Prolonged activation of IN1 neurons suppresses feeding. IN1 neurons receive inhibition from DSOG1 (descending subesophageal neurons) neurons, a group of GABAergic neurons that non-selectively suppress feeding. Our results reveal the function of pharyngeal mechanoreceptors and their downstream neural circuits in the control of food ingestion.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) have long been understood to express high levels of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) molecules but are not considered canonical antigen-presenting cells, and the impact of IEC-MHC class II signaling on gut homeostasis remains enigmatic. As IECs serve as the primary barrier between underlying host immune cells, we reasoned that IEC-intrinsic antigen presentation may play a role in responses toward the microbiota. Mice with an IEC-intrinsic deletion of MHC class II (IECΔMHC class II) are healthy but have fewer microbial-bound IgA, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and immune repertoire selection. This was associated with increased interindividual microbiota variation and altered proportions of two taxa in the ileum where MHC class II on IECs is highest. Intestinal mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) have similar MHC class II transcription but less surface MHC class II and are capable of acquiring MHC class II from IECs. Thus, epithelial-myeloid interactions mediate development of adaptive responses to microbial antigens within the gastrointestinal tract.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), consisting of transcription factors and their target sites, control neurogenesis and cell-fate specification in the developing central nervous system. In this study, we use integrated single-cell RNA and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) analysis in developing mouse and human retina to identify multiple interconnected, evolutionarily conserved GRNs composed of cell-type-specific transcription factors that both activate genes within their own network and inhibit genes in other networks. These GRNs control temporal patterning in primary progenitors, regulate transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. We confirm that NFI transcription factors selectively activate expression of genes promoting late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors and identify other transcription factors that regulate rod photoreceptor specification in postnatal retina. This study inventories cis- and trans-acting factors that control retinal development and can guide cell-based therapies aimed at replacing retinal neurons lost to disease.

Abstract: Summary
Embryos repair wounds rapidly, with no inflammation or scarring, in a process that involves polarization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Actomyosin polarization results in the assembly of a contractile cable around the wound that drives wound closure. Here, we demonstrate that a contractile actomyosin cable is not sufficient for rapid wound repair in Drosophila embryos. We show that wounding causes activation of the serine/threonine kinase p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the cells adjacent to the wound. p38 activation reduces the levels of wound-induced reactive oxygen species in the cells around the wound, limiting wound size. In addition, p38 promotes an increase in volume in the cells around the wound, thus facilitating the collective cell movements that drive rapid wound healing. Our data indicate that p38 regulates cell volumes through the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC1. Our work reveals cell growth and cell survival as cell behaviors critical for embryonic wound repair.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblast division is characterized by asymmetric positioning of the cleavage furrow, resulting in a large difference in size between the future daughter cells. In animal cells, furrow placement and assembly are governed by centralspindlin that accumulates at the equatorial cell cortex of the future cleavage site and at the spindle midzone. In neuroblasts, these two centralspindlin populations are spatially and temporally separated. A leading pool is located at the basal cleavage site and a second pool accumulates at the midzone before traveling to the cleavage site. The cortical centralspindlin population requires peripheral astral microtubules and the chromosome passenger complex for efficient recruitment. Loss of this pool does not prevent cytokinesis but enhances centralspindlin signaling at the midzone, leading to equatorial furrow repositioning and decreased size asymmetry. These data show that basal furrow positioning in neuroblasts results from a competition between different centralspindlin pools in which the cortical pool is dominant.

Abstract: Summary
The human brain is composed of functionally specialized systems that support cognition. Recently, we proposed an edge-centric model for detecting overlapping communities. It remains unclear how these communities and brain systems are related. Here, we address this question using data from the Midnight Scan Club and show that all brain systems are linked via at least two edge communities. We then examine the diversity of edge communities within each system, finding that heteromodal systems are more diverse than sensory systems. Next, we cluster the entire cortex to reveal it according to the regions’ edge-community profiles. We find that regions in heteromodal systems are more likely to form their own clusters. Finally, we show that edge communities are personalized. Our work reveals the pervasive overlap of edge communities across the cortex and their relationship with brain systems. Our work provides pathways for future research using edge-centric brain networks.

Abstract: Summary
The highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) poses a daunting challenge because the blood-brain barrier renders potentially druggable amplified or mutated oncoproteins relatively inaccessible. Here, we identify sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1), an enzyme that regulates the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide, as an actionable drug target in GBM. We show that the highly brain-penetrant antidepressant fluoxetine potently inhibits SMPD1 activity, killing GBMs, through inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and via activation of lysosomal stress. Combining fluoxetine with temozolomide, a standard of care for GBM, causes massive increases in GBM cell death and complete tumor regression in mice. Incorporation of real-world evidence from electronic medical records from insurance databases reveals significantly increased survival in GBM patients treated with fluoxetine, which was not seen in patients treated with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. These results nominate the repurposing of fluoxetine as a potentially safe and promising therapy for patients with GBM and suggest prospective randomized clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus) are terrestrial mammals that evolved unique scar-free regenerative wound-healing properties. Myofibroblasts (MFs) are the major scar-forming cell type in skin. We found that following traumatic injury to ear pinnae, MFs appeared rapidly in both Acomys and mouse yet persisted only in mouse. The timing of MF loss in Acomys correlated with wound closure, blastema differentiation, and nuclear localization of the Hippo pathway target protein Yap. Experiments in vitro revealed an accelerated PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation activity that maintained nuclear Yap in Acomys dermal fibroblasts (DFs) and was not detected in mouse or human DFs. Treatment of Acomys in vivo with the nuclear Yap-TEAD inhibitor verteporfin prolonged MF persistence and converted tissue regeneration to fibrosis. Forced Yap activity prevented and rescued TGF-β1-induced human MF formation in vitro. These results suggest that Acomys evolved modifications of Yap activity and MF fate important for scar-free regenerative wound healing in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium influx through plasma membrane calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are formed of hexamers of Orai1, is a potent trigger for many important biological processes, most notably in T cell-mediated immunity. Through a bioinformatics-led cell biological screen, we have identified Orai1 as a substrate for the rhomboid intramembrane protease RHBDL2. We show that RHBDL2 prevents stochastic calcium signaling in unstimulated cells through conformational surveillance and cleavage of inappropriately activated Orai1. A conserved disease-linked proline residue is responsible for RHBDL2’s recognizing the active conformation of Orai1, which is required to sharpen switch-like signaling triggered by store-operated calcium entry. Loss of RHBDL2 control of CRAC channel activity causes severe dysregulation of downstream CRAC channel effectors, including transcription factor activation, inflammatory cytokine expression, and T cell activation. We propose that this surveillance function may represent an ancient activity of rhomboid proteases in degrading unwanted signaling proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Endocytosis and endosome dynamics are controlled by proteins of the small GTPase Rab family. Besides possible recycling routes to the plasma membrane and various organelles, previously described endocytic pathways (e.g., clathrin-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, CLIC/GEEC pathway) all appear to funnel the endocytosed material to Rab5-positive early endosomes that then mature into Rab7-positive late endosomes/lysosomes. By studying the uptake of a series of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), we identify an endocytic pathway that moves material to nonacidic Lamp1-positive late endosomes. Trafficking via this endocytic route is fully independent of Rab5 and Rab7 but requires the Rab14 protein. The pathway taken by CPPs differs from the conventional Rab5-dependent endocytosis at the stage of vesicle formation already, as it is not affected by a series of compounds that inhibit macropinocytosis or clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The Rab14-dependent pathway is also used by physiological cationic molecules such as polyamines and homeodomains found in homeoproteins.

Abstract: Summary
Sculpting a flat patch of membrane into an endocytic vesicle requires curvature generation on the cell surface, which is the primary function of the endocytosis machinery. Using super-resolved live cell fluorescence imaging, we demonstrate that curvature generation by individual clathrin-coated pits can be detected in real time within cultured cells and tissues of developing organisms. Our analyses demonstrate that the footprint of clathrin coats increases monotonically during the formation of pits at different levels of plasma membrane tension. These findings are only compatible with models that predict curvature generation at the early stages of endocytic clathrin pit formation. We also found that CALM adaptors associated with clathrin plaques form clusters, whereas AP2 distribution is more homogenous. Considering the curvature sensing and driving roles of CALM, we propose that CALM clusters may increase the strain on clathrin lattices locally, eventually giving rise to rupture and subsequent pit completion at the edges of plaques.

Abstract: Summary
Hematophagous arthropods, such as mosquitoes, naturally carry and transmit hundreds of arboviruses to humans. Blood meal is a predominant physical interface that shapes cross-species communications among humans, bloodsuckers, and arboviruses. Here, we identify a human-blood-derived microRNA, hsa-miR-150-5p, that interferes with a mosquito antiviral system to facilitate flavivirus infection and transmission. hsa-miR-150-5p is acquired with a blood meal into the mosquito hemocoel and persists for a prolonged time there. The agomir of hsa-miR-150-5p enhances, whereas the antagomir represses flaviviral infection in mosquitoes and transmission from mice to mosquitoes. Mechanistic studies indicate that hsa-miR-150-5p hijacks the mosquito Argonaute-1-mediated RNA interference system to suppress the expression of some chymotrypsins with potent virucidal activity. Mosquito chymotrypsins are essential for resisting systemic flavivirus infection in hemocoel tissues. Chymotrypsin homologs potentially targeted by miR-150-5p are also found in other hematophagous arthropods, demonstrating a conserved miR-150-5p-mediated cross-species RNAi mechanism that might determine flaviviral transmissibility in nature.

Abstract: Summary
As pluripotent human embryonic stem cells progress toward one germ layer fate, they lose the ability to adopt alternative fates. Using a low-dimensional reaction coordinate to monitor progression toward ectoderm, we show that a differentiating stem cell’s probability of adopting a mesendodermal fate given appropriate signals falls sharply at a point along the ectoderm trajectory. We use this reaction coordinate to prospectively isolate and profile differentiating cells based on their mesendoderm competence and analyze their RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) profiles to identify transcription factors that control the cell’s mesendoderm competence. By modulating these key transcription factors, we can expand or contract the window of competence to adopt the mesendodermal fate along the ectodermal differentiation trajectory. The ability of the underlying gene regulatory network to modulate competence is essential for understanding human development and controlling the fate choices of stem cells in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as functional units in cancer and powerful biomarkers; however, most remain uncharacterized. Here, we analyze 5,592 prognostic lncRNAs in 9,446 cancers of 30 types using machine learning. We identify 166 lncRNAs whose expression correlates with survival and improves the accuracy of common clinical variables, molecular features, and cancer subtypes. Prognostic lncRNAs are often characterized by switch-like expression patterns. In low-grade gliomas, HOXA10-AS activation is a robust marker of poor prognosis that complements IDH1/2 mutations, as validated in another retrospective cohort, and correlates with developmental pathways in tumor transcriptomes. Loss- and gain-of-function studies in patient-derived glioma cells, organoids, and xenograft models identify HOXA10-AS as a potent onco-lncRNA that regulates cell proliferation, contact inhibition, invasion, Hippo signaling, and mitotic and neuro-developmental pathways. Our study underscores the pan-cancer potential of the non-coding transcriptome for identifying biomarkers and regulators of cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a key driver of several inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, in which affected tissues show an interferon-stimulated gene signature. Here, we demonstrate that TNF triggers a type-I interferon response that is dependent on the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. We show that TNF inhibits PINK1-mediated mitophagy and leads to altered mitochondrial function and to an increase in cytosolic mtDNA levels. Using cGAS-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we demonstrate that cytosolic mtDNA binds to cGAS after TNF treatment. Furthermore, TNF induces a cGAS-STING-dependent transcriptional response that mimics that of macrophages from rheumatoid arthritis patients. Finally, in an inflammatory arthritis mouse model, cGAS deficiency blocked interferon responses and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and joint swelling. These findings elucidate a molecular mechanism linking TNF to type-I interferon signaling and suggest a potential benefit for therapeutic targeting of cGAS/STING in TNF-driven diseases.

Abstract: Summary
At each cell division, the spindle self-organizes from microtubules and motors. In human spindles, the motors dynein and Eg5 generate contractile and extensile stress, respectively. Inhibiting dynein or its targeting factor NuMA leads to unfocused, turbulent spindles, and inhibiting Eg5 leads to monopoles; yet, bipolar spindles form when both are inhibited together. What, then, are the roles of these opposing motors? Here, we generate NuMA/dynein- and Eg5-doubly inhibited spindles that not only attain a typical metaphase shape and size but also undergo anaphase. However, these spindles have reduced microtubule dynamics and are mechanically fragile, fracturing under force. Furthermore, they exhibit lagging chromosomes and a dramatic left-handed twist at anaphase. Thus, although these opposing motors are not required for spindle shape, they are essential to its mechanical and functional robustness. This work suggests a design principle whereby opposing active stresses provide robustness to force-generating cellular structures.

Abstract: Summary
Effective treatments for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are lacking, and targeted agents have demonstrated limited efficacy. It has been speculated that a rare population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) drives growth, therapy resistance, and rapid metastatic progression in PDAC. These CSCs demonstrate high clonogenicity in vitro and tumorigenic potential in vivo. However, their relevance in established PDAC tissue has not been determined. Here, we use marker-independent stochastic clonal labeling, combined with quantitative modeling of tumor expansion, to uncover PDAC tissue growth dynamics. We find that in contrast to the CSC model, all PDAC cells display clonogenic potential in situ. Furthermore, the proximity to activated cancer-associated fibroblasts determines tumor cell clonogenicity. This means that the microenvironment is dominant in defining the clonogenic activity of PDAC cells. Indeed, manipulating the stroma by Hedgehog pathway inhibition alters the tumor growth mode, revealing that tumor-stroma crosstalk shapes tumor growth dynamics and clonal architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Regenerative neuroscience aims to stimulate endogenous repair in the nervous system to replace neurons lost from degenerative diseases. Recently, we reported that overexpressing the transcription factor Ascl1 in Müller glia (MG) is sufficient to stimulate MG to regenerate functional neurons in the adult mouse retina. However, this process is inefficient, and only a third of the Ascl1-expressing MG generate new neurons. Here, we test whether proneural transcription factors of the Atoh1/7 class can further promote the regenerative capacity of MG. We find that the combination of Ascl1:Atoh1 is remarkably efficient at stimulating neurogenesis, even in the absence of retinal injury. Using electrophysiology and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we demonstrate that Ascl1:Atoh1 generates a diversity of retinal neuron types, with the majority expressing characteristics of retinal ganglion cells. Our results provide a proof of principle that combinations of developmental transcription factors can substantially improve glial reprogramming to neurons and expand the repertoire of regenerated cell fates.

Abstract: Summary
Blood endothelial cells display remarkable plasticity depending on the demands of a malignant microenvironment. While studies in solid tumors focus on their role in metabolic adaptations, formation of high endothelial venules (HEVs) in lymph nodes extends their role to the organization of immune cell interactions. As a response to lymphoma growth, blood vessel density increases; however, the fate of HEVs remains elusive. Here, we report that lymphoma causes severe HEV regression in mouse models that phenocopies aggressive human B cell lymphomas. HEV dedifferentiation occurrs as a consequence of a disrupted lymph-carrying conduit system. Mechanosensitive fibroblastic reticular cells then deregulate CCL21 migration paths, followed by deterioration of dendritic cell proximity to HEVs. Loss of this crosstalk deprives HEVs of lymphotoxin-β-receptor (LTβR) signaling, which is indispensable for their differentiation and lymphocyte transmigration. Collectively, this study reveals a remodeling cascade of the lymph node microenvironment that is detrimental for immune cell trafficking in lymphoma.

Abstract: Summary
Converting checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-resistant individuals to being responsive requires identifying suppressive mechanisms. We identify TREM2+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as being correlated with exhausted CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in mouse syngeneic tumor models and human solid tumors of multiple histological types. Fc domain-enhanced anti-TREM2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy promotes anti-tumor immunity by elimination and modulation of TAM populations, which leads to enhanced CD8+ TIL infiltration and effector function. TREM2+ TAMs are most enriched in individuals with ovarian cancer, where TREM2 expression corresponds to disease grade accompanied by worse recurrence-free survival. In an aggressive orthotopic ovarian cancer model, anti-TREM2 mAb therapy drives potent anti-tumor immunity. These results highlight TREM2 as a highly attractive target for immunotherapy modulation in individuals who are refractory to CPI therapy and likely have a TAM-rich tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are intracellular Ca2+ channels that link extracellular stimuli to Ca2+ signals. Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is “quantal”: low IP3 concentrations rapidly release a fraction of the stores. Ca2+ release then slows or terminates without compromising responses to further IP3 additions. The mechanisms are unresolved. Here, we synthesize a high-affinity partial agonist of IP3Rs and use it to demonstrate that quantal responses do not require heterogenous Ca2+ stores. IP3Rs respond incrementally to IP3 and close after the initial response to low IP3 concentrations. Comparing functional responses with IP3 binding shows that only a tiny fraction of a cell’s IP3Rs mediate incremental Ca2+ release; inactivation does not therefore affect most IP3Rs. We conclude, and test by simulations, that Ca2+ signals evoked by IP3 pulses arise from rapid activation and then inactivation of very few IP3Rs. This allows IP3Rs to behave as increment detectors mediating graded Ca2+ release.

Abstract: Summary
Microenvironmental factors modulating age-related DNA damage are unclear. Non-pituitary growth hormone (npGH) is induced in human colon, non-transformed human colon cells, and fibroblasts, and in 3-dimensional intestinal organoids with age-associated DNA damage. Autocrine/paracrine npGH suppresses p53 and attenuates DNA damage response (DDR) by inducing TRIM29 and reducing ATM phosphorylation, leading to reduced DNA repair and DNA damage accumulation. Organoids cultured up to 4 months exhibit aging markers, p16, and SA-β-galactosidase and decreased telomere length, as well as DNA damage accumulation, with increased npGH, suppressed p53, and attenuated DDR. Suppressing GH in aged organoids increases p53 and decreases DNA damage. WT mice exhibit age-dependent colon DNA damage accumulation, while in aged mice devoid of colon GH signaling, DNA damage remains low, with elevated p53. As age-associated npGH induction enables a pro-proliferative microenvironment, abrogating npGH signaling could be targeted as anti-aging therapy by impeding DNA damage and age-related pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulates a wide range of sensory experiences. Chronic pain is known to impair normal neural response, leading to enhanced aversion. However, it remains unknown how nociceptive responses in the cortex are processed at the population level and whether such processes are disrupted by chronic pain. Using in vivo endoscopic calcium imaging, we identify increased population activity in response to noxious stimuli and stable patterns of functional connectivity among neurons in the prelimbic (PL) PFC from freely behaving rats. Inflammatory pain disrupts functional connectivity of PFC neurons and reduces the overall nociceptive response. Interestingly, ketamine, a well-known neuromodulator, restores the functional connectivity among PL-PFC neurons in the inflammatory pain model to produce anti-aversive effects. These results suggest a dynamic resource allocation mechanism in the prefrontal representations of pain and indicate that population activity in the PFC critically regulates pain and serves as an important therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulation often results from the action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) acting at a promoter, obscuring the individual regulatory effect of each TF on RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here we measure the fundamental regulatory interactions of TFs in E. coli by designing synthetic target genes that isolate individual TFs’ regulatory effects. Using a thermodynamic model, each TF’s regulatory interactions are decoupled from TF occupancy and interpreted as acting through (de)stabilization of RNAP and (de)acceleration of transcription initiation. We find that the contribution of each mechanism depends on TF identity and binding location; regulation immediately downstream of the promoter is insensitive to TF identity, but the same TFs regulate by distinct mechanisms upstream of the promoter. These two mechanisms are uncoupled and can act coherently, to reinforce the observed regulatory role (activation/repression), or incoherently, wherein the TF regulates two distinct steps with opposing effects.

Abstract: Summary
The cytoplasmic polyamine maintains cellular homeostasis by chelating toxic metal cations, regulating transcriptional activity, and protecting DNA. ATP13A2 was identified as a lysosomal polyamine exporter responsible for polyamine release into the cytosol, and its dysfunction is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other neural degradation diseases. ATP13A2 belongs to the P5 subfamily of the P-type ATPase family, but its mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human ATP13A2 under four different conditions, revealing the structural coupling between the polyamine binding and the dephosphorylation. Polyamine is bound at the luminal tunnel and recognized through numerous electrostatic and π-cation interactions, explaining its broad specificity. The unique N-terminal domain is anchored to the lipid membrane to stabilize the E2P conformation, thereby accelerating the E1P-to-E2P transition. These findings reveal the distinct mechanism of P5B ATPases, thereby paving the way for neuroprotective therapy by activating ATP13A2.

Abstract: Summary
Cell shape dynamics during development is tightly regulated and coordinated with cell fate determination. Triggered by an interplay between biochemical and mechanical signals, epithelia form complex tissues by undergoing coordinated cell shape changes, but how such spatiotemporal coordination is controlled remains an open question. To dissect biochemical signaling from purely mechanical cues, we developed a microfluidic system that experimentally triggers epithelial folding to recapitulate stereotypic deformations observed in vivo. Using this system, we observe that the apical or basal direction of folding results in strikingly different mechanical states at the fold boundary, where the balance between tissue tension and torque (arising from the imposed curvature) controls the spread of folding-induced calcium waves at a short timescale and induces spatial patterns of gene expression at longer timescales. Our work uncovers that folding-associated gradients of cell shape and their resulting mechanical stresses direct spatially distinct biochemical responses within the monolayer.

Abstract: Summary
AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission. Their surface expression, trafficking, gating, and pharmacology are regulated by auxiliary subunits. Of the two types of TARP auxiliary subunits, type I TARPs assume activating roles, while type II TARPs serve suppressive functions. We present cryo-EM structures of GluA2 AMPAR in complex with type II TARP γ5, which reduces steady-state currents, increases single-channel conductance, and slows recovery from desensitization. Regulation of AMPAR function depends on its ligand-binding domain (LBD) interaction with the γ5 head domain. GluA2-γ5 complex shows maximum stoichiometry of two TARPs per AMPAR tetramer, being different from type I TARPs but reminiscent of the auxiliary subunit GSG1L. Desensitization of both GluA2-GSG1L and GluA2-γ5 complexes is accompanied by rupture of LBD dimer interface, while GluA2-γ5 but not GluA2-GSG1L LBD dimers remain two-fold symmetric. Different structural architectures and desensitization mechanisms of complexes with auxiliary subunits endow AMPARs with broad functional capabilities.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy is a mainstay of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management. While tumor mutational burden (TMB) correlates with response to immunotherapy, little is known about the relationship between the baseline immune response and tumor genotype. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled 361,929 cells from 35 early-stage NSCLC lesions. We identified a cellular module consisting of PDCD1+CXCL13+ activated T cells, IgG+ plasma cells, and SPP1+ macrophages, referred to as the lung cancer activation module (LCAMhi). We confirmed LCAMhi enrichment in multiple NSCLC cohorts, and paired CITE-seq established an antibody panel to identify LCAMhi lesions. LCAM presence was found to be independent of overall immune cell content and correlated with TMB, cancer testis antigens, and TP53 mutations. High baseline LCAM scores correlated with enhanced NSCLC response to immunotherapy even in patients with above median TMB, suggesting that immune cell composition, while correlated with TMB, may be a nonredundant biomarker of response to immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is an inherent and important tumor suppressor mechanism. However, if not removed timely via immune surveillance, senescent cells also have detrimental effects. Although this has mostly been attributed to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of these cells, we recently proposed that “escape” from the senescent state is another unfavorable outcome. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we exploit genomic and functional data from a prototypical human epithelial cell model carrying an inducible CDC6 oncogene to identify an early-acquired recurrent chromosomal inversion that harbors a locus encoding the circadian transcription factor BHLHE40. This inversion alone suffices for BHLHE40 activation upon CDC6 induction and driving cell cycle re-entry of senescent cells, and malignant transformation. Ectopic overexpression of BHLHE40 prevented induction of CDC6-triggered senescence. We provide strong evidence in support of replication stress-induced genomic instability being a causative factor underlying “escape” from oncogene-induced senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Fat stores are critical for reproductive success and may govern maturation initiation. Here, we report that signaling and sensing fat sufficiency for sexual maturation commitment requires the lipid carrier apolipophorin in fat cells and Sema1a in the neuroendocrine prothoracic gland (PG). Larvae lacking apolpp or Sema1a fail to initiate maturation despite accruing sufficient fat stores, and they continue gaining weight until death. Mechanistically, sensing peripheral body-fat levels via the apolipophorin/Sema1a axis regulates endocytosis, endoplasmic reticulum remodeling, and ribosomal maturation for the acquisition of the PG cells’ high biosynthetic and secretory capacity. Downstream of apolipophorin/Sema1a, leptin-like upd2 triggers the cessation of feeding and initiates sexual maturation. Human Leptin in the insect PG substitutes for upd2, preventing obesity and triggering maturation downstream of Sema1a. These data show how peripheral fat levels regulate the control of the maturation decision-making process via remodeling of endomembranes and ribosomal biogenesis in gland cells.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has necessitated the rapid development of antibody-based therapies and vaccines as countermeasures. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize two protective anti-SARS-CoV-2 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in complex with the spike protein, revealing similarities between epitopes targeted by human and murine B cells. The more neutralizing mAb, 2B04, binds the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and competes with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By contrast, 2H04 binds adjacent to the RBM and does not compete for ACE2 binding. Naturally occurring sequence variants of SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding neutralization escape variants selected in vitro map to our structurally defined epitopes, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might evade therapeutic antibodies with a limited set of mutations, underscoring the importance of combination mAb therapeutics. Finally, we show that 2B04 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection by preventing ACE2 engagement, whereas 2H04 reduces host cell attachment without directly disrupting ACE2-RBM interactions, providing distinct inhibitory mechanisms used by RBD-specific mAbs.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the undisputable role of the small GTPase Rac1 in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, the Rac guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (Rac-GEFs) involved in Rac1-mediated motility and invasion in human lung adenocarcinoma cells remain largely unknown. Here, we identify FARP1, ARHGEF39, and TIAM2 as essential Rac-GEFs responsible for Rac1-mediated lung cancer cell migration upon EGFR and c-Met activation. Noteworthily, these Rac-GEFs operate in a non-redundant manner by controlling distinctive aspects of ruffle dynamics formation. Mechanistic analysis reveals a leading role of the AXL-Gab1-PI3K axis in conferring pro-motility traits downstream of EGFR. Along with the positive association between the overexpression of Rac-GEFs and poor lung adenocarcinoma patient survival, we show that FARP1 and ARHGEF39 are upregulated in EpCam+ cells sorted from primary human lung adenocarcinomas. Overall, our study reveals fundamental insights into the complex intricacies underlying Rac-GEF-mediated cancer cell motility signaling, hence underscoring promising targets for metastatic lung cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The brain selectively allocates attention from a continuous stream of sensory input. This process is typically attributed to computations in distinct regions of the forebrain and midbrain. Here, we explore whether cerebellar Purkinje cells encode information about the selection of sensory inputs and could thereby contribute to non-motor forms of learning. We show that complex spikes of individual Purkinje cells change the sensory modality they encode to reflect changes in the perceived salience of sensory input. Comparisons with mouse models deficient in cerebellar plasticity suggest that changes in complex spike activity instruct potentiation of Purkinje cells simple spike firing, which is required for efficient learning. Our findings suggest that during learning, climbing fibers do not directly guide motor output, but rather contribute to a general readiness to act via changes in simple spike activity, thereby bridging the sequence from non-motor to motor functions.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in DNA methylation are associated with normal cardiogenesis, whereas altered methylation patterns can occur in congenital heart disease. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and promote locus-specific DNA demethylation. Here, we characterize stage-specific methylation dynamics and the function of TETs during human cardiomyocyte differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in which all three TET genes are inactivated fail to generate cardiomyocytes (CMs), with altered mesoderm patterning and defective cardiac progenitor specification. Genome-wide methylation analysis shows TET knockout causes promoter hypermethylation of genes encoding WNT inhibitors, leading to hyperactivated WNT signaling and defects in cardiac mesoderm patterning. TET activity is also needed to maintain hypomethylated status and expression of NKX2-5 for subsequent cardiac progenitor specification. Finally, loss of TETs causes a set of cardiac structural genes to fail to be demethylated at the cardiac progenitor stage. Our data demonstrate key roles for TET proteins in controlling methylation dynamics at sequential steps during human cardiac development.

Abstract: Summary
Brain circuits are comprised of distinct interconnected neurons that are assembled by synaptic recognition molecules presented by defined pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This cell-cell recognition process is mediated by varying cellular adhesion molecules, including the latrophilin family of adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors. Focusing on parahippocampal circuitry, we find that latrophilin-2 (Lphn2; gene symbol ADGRL2) is specifically enriched in interconnected subregions of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), presubiculum (PrS), and parasubiculum (PaS). Retrograde viral tracing from the Lphn2-enriched region of the MEC reveals unique topographical patterning of inputs arising from the PrS and PaS that mirrors Lphn2 expression. Using a Lphn2 conditional knockout mouse model, we find that deletion of MEC Lphn2 expression selectively impairs retrograde viral labeling of inputs arising from the ipsilateral PrS. Combined with analysis of Lphn2 expression within the MEC, this study reveals Lphn2 to be selectively expressed by defined cell types and essential for MEC-PrS circuit connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
Drinking behavior in rodents is characterized by stereotyped, rhythmic licking movement, which is regulated by the basal ganglia. It is unclear how direct and indirect pathways control the lick bout and individual spout contact. We find that inactivating D1 and D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the ventrolateral striatum (VLS) oppositely alters the number of licks in a bout. D1- and D2-MSNs exhibit different patterns of lick-sequence-related activity and different phases of oscillation time-locked to the lick cycle. On the timescale of a lick cycle, transient inactivation of D1-MSNs during tongue protrusion reduces spout contact probability, whereas transiently inactivating D2-MSNs has no effect. On the timescale of a lick bout, inactivation of D1-MSNs (D2-MSNs) causes rate increase (decrease) in a subset of basal ganglia output neurons that decrease firing during licking. Our results reveal the distinct roles of D1- and D2-MSNs in regulating licking at both coarse and fine timescales.

Abstract: Summary
Memory T cells exhibit considerable diversity that determines their ability to be protective. Here, we examine whether changes in T cell heterogeneity contribute to the age-associated failure of immune memory. By screening for age-dependent T cell-surface markers, we identify CD4 and CD8 memory T cell subsets that are unrelated to previously defined subsets of central and effector memory cells. Memory T cells expressing the ecto-5ʹ-nucleotidase CD73 constitute a functionally distinct subset of memory T cells that declines with age. They resemble long-lived, polyfunctional memory cells but are also poised to display effector functions and to develop into cells resembling tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs). Upstream regulators of differential chromatin accessibility and transcriptomes include transcription factors that facilitate CD73 expression and regulate TRM differentiation. CD73 is not just a surrogate marker of these regulatory networks but is directly involved in T cell survival.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic injury to hepatocytes results in inflammation, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The tetraspanin TM4SF5 is implicated in fibrosis and cancer. We investigate the role of TM4SF5 in communication between hepatocytes and macrophages (MΦs) and its possible influence on the inflammatory microenvironment that may lead to NAFLD. TM4SF5 induction in differentiated MΦs promotes glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glucose sensitivity, leading to M1-type MΦ activation. Activated M1-type MΦs secrete pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6), which induces the secretion of CCL20 and CXCL10 from TM4SF5-positive hepatocytes. Although TM4SF5-dependent secretion of these chemokines enhances glycolysis in M0 MΦs, further chronic exposure reprograms MΦs for an increase in the proportion of M2-type MΦs in the population, which may support diet- and chemical-induced NAFLD progression. We suggest that TM4SF5 expression in MΦs and hepatocytes is critically involved in modulating the inflammatory environment during NAFLD progression.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages undergoing M1- versus M2-type polarization differ significantly in their cell metabolism and cellular functions. Here, global quantitative time-course proteomics and phosphoproteomics paired with transcriptomics provide a comprehensive characterization of temporal changes in cell metabolism, cellular functions, and signaling pathways that occur during the induction phase of M1- versus M2-type polarization. Significant differences in, especially, metabolic pathways are observed, including changes in glucose metabolism, glycosaminoglycan metabolism, and retinoic acid signaling. Kinase-enrichment analysis shows activation patterns of specific kinases that are distinct in M1- versus M2-type polarization. M2-type polarization inhibitor drug screens identify drugs that selectively block M2- but not M1-type polarization, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. These datasets provide a comprehensive resource to identify specific signaling and metabolic pathways that are critical for macrophage polarization. In a proof-of-principle approach, we use these datasets to show that MEK signaling is required for M2-type polarization by promoting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)-induced retinoic acid signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Micronuclei are a hallmark of cancer and several other human disorders. Recently, micronuclei were implicated in chromothripsis, a series of massive genomic rearrangements that may drive tumor evolution and progression. Here, we show that Aurora B kinase mediates a surveillance mechanism that integrates error correction during anaphase with spatial control of nuclear envelope reassembly to prevent micronuclei formation. Using high-resolution live-cell imaging of human cancer and non-cancer cells, we uncover that anaphase lagging chromosomes are more frequent than previously anticipated, yet they rarely form micronuclei. Micronuclei formation from anaphase lagging chromosomes is prevented by a midzone-based Aurora B phosphorylation gradient that stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments and assists spindle forces required for anaphase error correction while delaying nuclear envelope reassembly on lagging chromosomes, independently of microtubule density. We propose that a midzone-based Aurora B phosphorylation gradient actively monitors and corrects frequent chromosome segregation errors to prevent micronuclei formation during human cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome mis-segregation during mitosis leads to aneuploidy, which is a hallmark of cancer and linked to cancer genome evolution. Errors can manifest as “lagging chromosomes” in anaphase, although their mechanistic origins and likelihood of correction are incompletely understood. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet microscopy, endogenous protein labeling, and computational analysis to define the life history of >104 kinetochores. By defining the “laziness” of kinetochores in anaphase, we reveal that chromosomes are at a considerable risk of mis-segregation. We show that the majority of lazy kinetochores are corrected rapidly in anaphase by Aurora B; if uncorrected, they result in a higher rate of micronuclei formation. Quantitative analyses of the kinetochore life histories reveal a dynamic signature of metaphase kinetochore oscillations that forecasts their anaphase fate. We propose that in diploid human cells chromosome segregation is fundamentally error prone, with an additional layer of anaphase error correction required for stable karyotype propagation.

Abstract: Summary
N-type voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels mediate Ca2+ influx at presynaptic terminals in response to action potentials and play vital roles in synaptogenesis, release of neurotransmitters, and nociceptive transmission. Here, we elucidate a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human CaV2.2 complex in apo, ziconotide-bound, and two CaV2.2-specific pore blockers-bound states. The second voltage-sensing domain (VSD) is captured in a resting-state conformation, trapped by a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecule, which is distinct from the other three VSDs of CaV2.2, as well as activated VSDs observed in previous structures of CaV channels. This structure reveals the molecular basis for the unique inactivation process of CaV2.2 channels, in which the intracellular gate formed by S6 helices is closed and a W-helix from the domain II–III linker stabilizes closed-state inactivation. The structures of this inactivated, drug-bound complex lay a solid foundation for developing new state-dependent blockers for treatment of chronic pain.

Abstract: Summary
ADAPTeR is a prospective, phase II study of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) in 15 treatment-naive patients (115 multiregion tumor samples) with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) aiming to understand the mechanism underpinning therapeutic response. Genomic analyses show no correlation between tumor molecular features and response, whereas ccRCC-specific human endogenous retrovirus expression indirectly correlates with clinical response. T cell receptor (TCR) analysis reveals a significantly higher number of expanded TCR clones pre-treatment in responders suggesting pre-existing immunity. Maintenance of highly similar clusters of TCRs post-treatment predict response, suggesting ongoing antigen engagement and survival of families of T cells likely recognizing the same antigens. In responders, nivolumab-bound CD8+ T cells are expanded and express GZMK/B. Our data suggest nivolumab drives both maintenance and replacement of previously expanded T cell clones, but only maintenance correlates with response. We hypothesize that maintenance and boosting of a pre-existing response is a key element of anti-PD-1 mode of action.

Abstract: Summary
Early steps of cancer initiation and metastasis, while critical for understanding disease mechanisms, are difficult to visualize and study. Here, we describe an approach to study the processes of initiation, progression, and metastasis of prostate cancer (PC) in a genetically engineered RapidCaP mouse model, which combines whole-organ imaging by serial two-photon tomography (STPT) and post hoc thick-section immunofluorescent (IF) analysis. STPT enables the detection of single tumor-initiating cells within the entire prostate, and consequent IF analysis reveals a transition from normal to transformed epithelial tissue and cell escape from the tumor focus. STPT imaging of the liver and brain reveal the distribution of multiple metastatic foci in the liver and an early-stage metastatic cell invasion in the brain. This imaging and data analysis pipeline can be readily applied to other mouse models of cancer, offering a highly versatile whole-organ platform to study in situ mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in multiple copies in human cells. We evaluated cross-sectional associations of whole-blood mtDNA copy number (CN) with several cardiometabolic disease traits in 408,361 participants of multiple ancestries in TOPMed and UK Biobank. Age showed a threshold association with mtDNA CN: each additional 10 years of age was associated with a 0.03 SD higher level of mtDNA CN (p = 0.0014) among younger participants (younger than 65 years) versus a 0.14 SD lower level of mtDNA CN (p = 1.82 × 10−13) among older participants (65 years and older). At lower mtDNA CN levels, we found age-independent associations with increased odds of obesity (p = 5.6 × 10−238), hypertension (p = 2.8 × 10−50), diabetes (p = 3.6 × 10−7), and hyperlipidemia (p = 6.3 × 10−56). The observed decline in mtDNA CN after 65 years of age may be a key to understanding age-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation (XCI) require epigenetic mechanisms to encode allele-specific expression, but how these specific tasks are accomplished at single loci or across chromosomal scales remains incompletely understood. Here, we systematically disrupt essential epigenetic pathways within polymorphic embryos in order to examine canonical and non-canonical genomic imprinting as well as XCI. We find that DNA methylation and Polycomb group repressors are indispensable for autosomal imprinting, albeit at distinct gene sets. Moreover, the extraembryonic ectoderm relies on a broader spectrum of imprinting mechanisms, including non-canonical targeting of maternal endogenous retrovirus (ERV)-driven promoters by the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a. We further identify Polycomb-dependent and -independent gene clusters on the imprinted X chromosome, which appear to reflect distinct domains of Xist-mediated suppression. From our data, we assemble a comprehensive inventory of the epigenetic pathways that maintain parent-specific imprinting in eutherian mammals, including an expanded view of the placental lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Ventral subiculum (vSUB) is integral to the regulation of stress and reward; however, the intrinsic connectivity and synaptic properties of the inhibitory local circuit are poorly understood. Neurexin-3 (Nrxn3) is highly expressed in hippocampal inhibitory neurons, but its function at inhibitory synapses has remained elusive. Using slice electrophysiology, imaging, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify multiple roles for Nrxn3 at GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) interneuron synapses made onto vSUB regular-spiking (RS) and burst-spiking (BS) principal neurons. Surprisingly, we find that intrinsic connectivity of vSUB and synaptic function of Nrxn3 in vSUB are sexually dimorphic. We reveal that PVs make preferential contact with RS neurons in male mice, but BS neurons in female mice. Furthermore, we determine that despite comparable Nrxn3 isoform expression in male and female PV neurons, Nrxn3 knockout impairs synapse density, postsynaptic strength, and inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude at PV-RS synapses in males, but enhances presynaptic release and IPSC amplitude in females.

Abstract: Summary
Assembly and disassembly of DNA repair protein complexes at DNA damage sites are essential for maintaining genomic integrity. Investigating factors coordinating assembly of the base excision repair (BER) proteins DNA polymerase β (Polβ) and XRCC1 to DNA lesion sites identifies a role for Polβ in regulating XRCC1 disassembly from DNA repair complexes and, conversely, demonstrates Polβ’s dependence on XRCC1 for complex assembly. LivePAR, a genetically encoded probe for live-cell imaging of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), reveals that Polβ and XRCC1 require PAR for repair-complex assembly, with PARP1 and PARP2 playing unique roles in complex dynamics. Further, BER complex assembly is modulated by attenuation/augmentation of NAD+ biosynthesis. Finally, SIRT6 does not modulate PARP1 or PARP2 activation but does regulate XRCC1 recruitment, leading to diminished Polβ abundance at sites of DNA damage. These findings highlight coordinated yet independent roles for PARP1, PARP2, and SIRT6 and their regulation by NAD+ bioavailability to facilitate BER.

Abstract: Summary
The main viral protease (3CLpro) is indispensable for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We delineate the human protein substrate landscape of 3CLpro by TAILS substrate-targeted N-terminomics. We identify more than 100 substrates in human lung and kidney cells supported by analyses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Enzyme kinetics and molecular docking simulations of 3CLpro engaging substrates reveal how noncanonical cleavage sites, which diverge from SARS-CoV, guide substrate specificity. Cleaving the interactors of essential effector proteins, effectively stranding them from their binding partners, amplifies the consequences of proteolysis. We show that 3CLpro targets the Hippo pathway, including inactivation of MAP4K5, and key effectors of transcription, mRNA processing, and translation. We demonstrate that Spike glycoprotein directly binds galectin-8, with galectin-8 cleavage disengaging CALCOCO2/NDP52 to decouple antiviral-autophagy. Indeed, in post-mortem COVID-19 lung samples, NDP52 rarely colocalizes with galectin-8, unlike in healthy lungs. The 3CLpro substrate degradome establishes a foundational substrate atlas to accelerate exploration of SARS-CoV-2 pathology and drug design.

Abstract: Summary
Opiates produce a strong rewarding effect, but abstinence from opiate use emerges with severe negative emotions. Depression is one of the most frequent emotion disorders associated with opiate abstinence, which is thought to be a main cause for relapse. However, neurobiological bases of such an aversive emotion processing are poorly understood. Here, we find that morphine abstinence activates κ-opioid receptors (KORs) by increasing endogenous KOR ligand dynorphin expression in the amygdala, which in turn facilitates glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) expression by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Upregulation of GLT1 expression contributes to opiate-abstinence-elicited depressive-like behaviors through modulating amygdalar glutamatergic inputs to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Intra-amygdala injection of GLT1 inhibitor DHK or knockdown of GLT1 expression in the amygdala significantly suppresses morphine-abstinence-induced depressive-like behaviors. Pharmacological and pharmacogenetic activation of amygdala-NAc projections prevents morphine-abstinence-induced behaviors. Overall, our study provides key molecular and circuit insights into the mechanisms of depression associated with opiate abstinence.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive impairment (CI) is a disabling concomitant of multiple sclerosis (MS) with a complex and controversial pathogenesis. The cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is involved in the immune pathogenesis of MS, but its possible effects on synaptic function and cognition are still largely unexplored. In this study, we show that the IL-17A receptor (IL-17RA) is highly expressed by hippocampal neurons in the CA1 area and that exposure to IL-17A dose-dependently disrupts hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) through the activation of its receptor and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), IL-17A overexpression is paralleled by hippocampal LTP dysfunction. An in vivo behavioral analysis shows that visuo-spatial learning abilities are preserved when EAE is induced in mice lacking IL-17A. Overall, this study suggests a key role for the IL-17 axis in the neuro-immune cross-talk occurring in the hippocampal CA1 area and its potential involvement in synaptic dysfunction and MS-related CI.

Abstract: Summary
Human neuroimaging studies have shown that, during cognitive processing, the brain undergoes dynamic transitions between multiple, frequency-tuned states of activity. Although different states may emerge from distinct sources of neural activity, it remains unclear whether single-area neuronal spiking can also drive multiple dynamic states. In mice, we ask whether frequency modulation of the entorhinal cortex activity causes dynamic states to emerge and whether these states respond to distinct stimulation frequencies. Using hidden Markov modeling, we perform unsupervised detection of transient states in mouse brain-wide fMRI fluctuations induced via optogenetic frequency modulation of excitatory neurons. We unveil the existence of multiple, frequency-dependent dynamic states, invisible through standard static fMRI analyses. These states are linked to different anatomical circuits and disrupted in a frequency-dependent fashion in a transgenic model of cognitive disease directly related to entorhinal cortex dysfunction. These findings provide cross-scale insight into basic neuronal mechanisms that may underpin flexibility in brain-wide dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells play crucial roles in suppressing deleterious immune response. Here, we investigate how Treg cells are mechanistically induced in vitro (iTreg) and stabilized via transcriptional regulation of Treg lineage-specifying factor Foxp3. We find that acetylation of histone tails at the Foxp3 promoter is required for inducing Foxp3 transcription. Upon induction, histone acetylation signals via bromodomain-containing proteins, particularly targets of inhibitor JQ1, and sustains Foxp3 transcription via a global or trans effect. Subsequently, Tet-mediated DNA demethylation of Foxp3 cis-regulatory elements, mainly enhancer CNS2, increases chromatin accessibility and protein binding, stabilizing Foxp3 transcription and obviating the need for the histone acetylation signal. These processes transform stochastic iTreg induction into a stable cell fate, with the former sensitive and the latter resistant to genetic and environmental perturbations. Thus, sequential histone acetylation and DNA demethylation in Foxp3 induction and maintenance reflect stepwise mechanical switches governing iTreg cell lineage specification.

Abstract: Summary
Human biomedical datasets that are critical for research and clinical studies to benefit human health also often contain sensitive or potentially identifying information of individual participants. Thus, care must be taken when they are processed and made available to comply with ethical and regulatory frameworks and informed consent data conditions. To enable and streamline data access for these biomedical datasets, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Data Use and Researcher Identities (DURI) work stream developed and approved the Data Use Ontology (DUO) standard. DUO is a hierarchical vocabulary of human and machine-readable data use terms that consistently and unambiguously represents a dataset’s allowable data uses. DUO has been implemented by major international stakeholders such as the Broad and Sanger Institutes and is currently used in annotation of over 200,000 datasets worldwide. Using DUO in data management and access facilitates researchers’ discovery and access of relevant datasets. DUO annotations increase the FAIRness of datasets and support data linkages using common data use profiles when integrating the data for secondary analyses. DUO is implemented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and, to increase community awareness and engagement, hosted in an open, centralized GitHub repository. DUO, together with the GA4GH Passport standard, offers a new, efficient, and streamlined data authorization and access framework that has enabled increased sharing of biomedical datasets worldwide.

Abstract: We report a case of the anaplastic spindle cell squamous carcinoma(SC) arising from classical papillary thyroid carcinoma(PTC) with foci of columnar cell component in a 69-year-old Chinese woman. The tumor of the right lobe was composed of spindle cell SC and PTC. Histologically,the spindle cell SC were arranged into bundles with marked cellular atypia, nuclear pleomorphism and more mitotic figures. The tumor of the left lobe was a PTC without any SC elements,which was composed of two components, namely classical and columnar cell variants PTC. The columnar cell elements occupied more than 20 % of PTC, which showed striking stratification of nuclei with no characteristic nuclei for the classical type of PTC. The patient has not received any other treatment after radical surgery. She had no tumor recurrence and other complications 13 months after operation. Only classical PTC but not columnar cell PTC and SC had been identified in 7 out of 50 excised cervical lymph nodes. In order to clarify the origin of PTC and spindle cell SC, we performed the BRAFV600E(c.1799 T > A) mutational analysis. The results of molecular analysis showed that BRAFV600E(c.1799 T > A) mutation existed in both components, which further confirmed that spindle cell SC was transformed from PTC.

Abstract: Summary
The existence of a dysfunctional CD8+ T cell state in cancer is well established. However, the degree to which CD8+ T cell fates are influenced by the context in which they encounter cognate tumor antigen is less clear. We previously demonstrated that CD8+ T cells reactive to a model leukemia antigen were deleted by antigen cross-presenting type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s). Here, through a study of T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic CD8+ T cells (TCRTg101) reactive to a native C1498 leukemia cell antigen, we uncover a different mode of T cell tolerance in which TCRTg101 undergo progressive expansion and differentiation into an exhausted state. Antigen encounter by TCRTg101 requires leukemia cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I expression and is independent of DCs, implying that leukemia cells directly mediate the exhausted TCRTg101 phenotype. Collectively, our data reveal that leukemia antigens are presented to CD8+ T cells via discrete pathways, leading to distinct tolerant states.

Abstract: Summary
Polyphosphate (polyP) is a polymer of hundreds of phosphate residues present in all organisms. In mammals, polyP is involved in crucial physiological processes, including coagulation, inflammation, and stress response. However, after decades of research, the metabolic enzymes are still unknown. Here, we purify and identify Nudt3, a NUDIX family member, as the enzyme responsible for polyP phosphatase activity in mammalian cells. We show that Nudt3 shifts its substrate specificity depending on the cation; specifically, Nudt3 is active on polyP when Zn2+ is present. Nudt3 has in vivo polyP phosphatase activity in human cells, and importantly, we show that cells with altered polyP levels by modifying Nudt3 protein amount present reduced viability upon oxidative stress and increased DNA damage, suggesting that polyP and Nudt3 play a role in oxidative stress protection. Finally, we show that Nudt3 is involved in the early stages of embryo development in zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor clustering is the first and critical step to activate apoptosis by death receptor-5 (DR5). The recent discovery of the autoinhibitory DR5 ectodomain has challenged the long-standing view of its mechanistic activation by the natural ligand Apo2L. Because the autoinhibitory residues have remained unknown, here we characterize a crucial patch of positively charged residues (PPCR) in the highly variable domain of DR5. The PPCR electrostatically separates DR5 receptors to autoinhibit their clustering in the absence of ligand and antibody binding. Mutational substitution and antibody-mediated PPCR interference resulted in increased apoptotic cytotoxic function. A dually specific antibody that enables sustained tampering with PPCR function exceptionally enhanced DR5 clustering and apoptotic activation and distinctively improved the survival of animals bearing aggressive metastatic and recurrent tumors, whereas clinically tested DR5 antibodies without PPCR blockade function were largely ineffective. Our study provides mechanistic insights into DR5 activation and a therapeutic analytical design for potential clinical success.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in ATP13A2, also known as PARK9, cause a rare monogenic form of juvenile-onset Parkinson’s disease named Kufor-Rakeb syndrome and other neurodegenerative diseases. ATP13A2 encodes a neuroprotective P5B P-type ATPase highly enriched in the brain that mediates selective import of spermine ions from lysosomes into the cytosol via an unknown mechanism. Here we present three structures of human ATP13A2 bound to an ATP analog or to spermine in the presence of phosphomimetics determined by cryoelectron microscopy. ATP13A2 autophosphorylation opens a lysosome luminal gate to reveal a narrow lumen access channel that holds a spermine ion in its entrance. ATP13A2’s architecture suggests physical principles underlying selective polyamine transport and anticipates a “pump-channel” intermediate that could function as a counter-cation conduit to facilitate lysosome acidification. Our findings establish a firm foundation to understand ATP13A2 mutations associated with disease and bring us closer to realizing ATP13A2’s potential in neuroprotective therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate in close association with rearranged intracellular membranes. For hepatitis C virus (HCV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), these rearrangements comprise endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived double membrane vesicles (DMVs) serving as RNA replication sites. Cellular factors involved in DMV biogenesis are poorly defined. Here, we show that despite structural similarity of viral DMVs with autophagosomes, conventional macroautophagy is dispensable for HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, both viruses exploit factors involved in autophagosome formation, most notably class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). As revealed with a biosensor, PI3K is activated in cells infected with either virus to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) while kinase complex inhibition or depletion profoundly reduces replication and viral DMV formation. The PI3P-binding protein DFCP1, recruited to omegasomes in early steps of autophagosome formation, participates in replication and DMV formation of both viruses. These results indicate that phylogenetically unrelated HCV and SARS-CoV-2 exploit similar components of the autophagy machinery to create their replication organelles.

Abstract: Summary
Following infection or immunization, memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived plasma cells provide humoral immunity that can last for decades. Most principles of MBC biology have been determined with hapten-protein carrier models or fluorescent protein immunizations. Here, we examine the temporal dynamics of the germinal center (GC) B cell and MBC response following mouse influenza A virus infection. We find that antiviral B cell responses within the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) and the spleen are distinct in regard to duration, enrichment for antigen-binding cells, and class switching dynamics. While splenic GCs dissolve after 6 weeks post-infection, mLN hemagglutinin-specific (HA+) GCs can persist for 22 weeks. Persistent GCs continuously differentiate MBCs, with “peak” and “late” GCs contributing equal numbers of HA+ MBCs to the long-lived compartment. Our findings highlight critical aspects of persistent GC responses and MBC differentiation following respiratory virus infection with direct implications for developing effective vaccination strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient sensing pathways influence metabolic health and aging, offering the possibility that diet might be used therapeutically, alone or with drugs targeting these pathways. We used the Geometric Framework for Nutrition to study interactive and comparative effects of diet and drugs on the hepatic proteome in mice across 40 dietary treatments differing in macronutrient ratios, energy density, and drug treatment (metformin, rapamycin, resveratrol). There was a strong negative correlation between dietary energy and the spliceosome and a strong positive correlation between dietary protein and mitochondria, generating oxidative stress at high protein intake. Metformin, rapamycin, and resveratrol had lesser effects than and dampened responses to diet. Rapamycin and metformin reduced mitochondrial responses to dietary protein while the effects of carbohydrates and fat were downregulated by resveratrol. Dietary composition has a powerful impact on the hepatic proteome, not just on metabolic pathways but fundamental processes such as mitochondrial function and RNA splicing.

Abstract: Summary
Tfcp2l1 can maintain mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) self-renewal. However, it remains unknown how Tfcp2l1 protein stability is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) targets Tfcp2l1 for ubiquitination and degradation in a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2)-dependent manner. Specifically, β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 recognize and ubiquitylate Tfcp2l1 through the canonical β-TrCP-binding motif DSGDNS, in which the serine residues have been phosphorylated by MK2. Point mutation of serine-to-alanine residues reduces β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitylation and enhances the ability of Tfcp2l1 to promote mESC self-renewal while repressing the speciation of the endoderm, mesoderm, and trophectoderm. Similarly, inhibition of MK2 reduces the association of Tfcp2l1 with β-TrCP1 and increases the self-renewal-promoting effects of Tfcp2l1, whereas overexpression of MK2 or β-TrCP genes decreases Tfcp2l1 protein levels and induces mESC differentiation. Collectively, our study reveals a posttranslational modification of Tfcp2l1 that will expand our understanding of the regulatory network of stem cell pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
The thymus, which is the primary site of T cell development, is particularly sensitive to insult but also has a remarkable capacity for repair. However, the mechanisms orchestrating regeneration are poorly understood, and delayed repair is common after cytoreductive therapies. Here, we demonstrate a trigger of thymic regeneration, centered on detecting the loss of dying thymocytes that are abundant during steady-state T cell development. Specifically, apoptotic thymocytes suppressed production of the regenerative factors IL-23 and BMP4 via TAM receptor signaling and activation of the Rho-GTPase Rac1, the intracellular pattern recognition receptor NOD2, and micro-RNA-29c. However, after damage, when profound thymocyte depletion occurs, this TAM-Rac1-NOD2-miR29c pathway is attenuated, increasing production of IL-23 and BMP4. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of Rac1-GTPase enhanced thymic function after acute damage. These findings identify a complex trigger of tissue regeneration and offer a regenerative strategy for restoring immune competence in patients whose thymic function has been compromised.

Abstract: Summary
Deciphering gene function requires the ability to control gene expression in space and time. Binary systems such as the Gal4/UAS provide a powerful means to modulate gene expression and to induce loss or gain of function. This is best exemplified in Drosophila, where the Gal4/UAS system has been critical to discover conserved mechanisms in development, physiology, neurobiology, and metabolism, to cite a few. Here we describe a transgenic light-inducible Gal4/UAS system (ShineGal4/UAS) based on Magnet photoswitches. We show that it allows efficient, rapid, and robust activation of UAS-driven transgenes in different tissues and at various developmental stages in Drosophila. Furthermore, we illustrate how ShineGal4 enables the generation of gain and loss-of-function phenotypes at animal, organ, and cellular levels. Thanks to the large repertoire of UAS-driven transgenes, ShineGal4 enriches the Drosophila genetic toolkit by allowing in vivo control of gene expression with high temporal and spatial resolutions.

Abstract: Summary
Nearly one-third of children with medulloblastoma, a malignant embryonal tumor of the cerebellum, succumb to their disease. Conventional response monitoring by imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology remains challenging, and a marker for measurable residual disease (MRD) is lacking. Here, we show the clinical utility of CSF-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker of MRD in serial samples collected from children with medulloblastoma (123 patients, 476 samples) enrolled on a prospective trial. Using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, tumor-associated copy-number variations in CSF-derived cfDNA are investigated as an MRD surrogate. MRD is detected at baseline in 85% and 54% of patients with metastatic and localized disease, respectively. The number of MRD-positive patients declines with therapy, yet those with persistent MRD have significantly higher risk of progression. Importantly, MRD detection precedes radiographic progression in half who relapse. Our findings advocate for the prospective assessment of CSF-derived liquid biopsies in future trials for medulloblastoma.

Abstract: Objective(s)
To investigate and test the hypotheses that FGF-2 enhanced myocardial differentiation with rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).
Materials and methods
Lentiviral vectors carrying the FGF-2 gene were transfected into rat BMSCs firstly. According to the different inducing agents, they were divided into the following four groups: group A (BMSCs blank control group), group B (FGF-2 induction group), group C (Lenti-FGF-2-GFP lentivirus transfection group), and the group D (Lenti-control-GFP lentiviral transfer). Then several kinds of experimental methods such as real-time PCR, immunocytochemical staining, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot, and transmission electron microscopy were used to elucidate the effects by which FGF-2 adjusts myocardial differentiation in rat BMSCs.
Results
The results of real-time PCR showed that GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 were expressed in all groups of cells. Compared with the experimental control group, the expression of GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 genes was the strongest after induction of 2 weeks in each induction group, and gradually decreased after induction of 4 weeks. Among them, the relative expression levels of GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 genes in Lenti-FGF-2-GFP were highest at all time points. The expressions of cTnI, cTnT, Cx43, and Desmin were detected by immunocytochemical staining and immunofluorescence staining. After 4 weeks of induction, cTnI, cTnT, Cx43, and Desmin were positively expressed in the cytoplasm of cells. Statistical analysis showed that the integrated optical density (IOD) values of the markers in the Lenti-FGF-2-GFP were the strongest. Cx43 and cTnI were weakly positive or negative in the experimental control group. There was a significant difference in the positive expression of each marker in each induction group and the experimental control group. Western blot analysis showed that Tromyosin (Tm) and Desmin were expressed in the blank group, FGF-2 drug-induced group, Lenti-FGF-2-GFP, and empty virus control transfection group after 4 weeks of induction, among which FGF-2 lentivirus transfected. The expression levels of Tm and Desmin were the highest in the staining induction group. Statistical analysis showed that the positive expressions of Tm and Desmin in each experimental group were statistically significant. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the nucleus of the cells transfected and induced by FGF-2 was located at the center of the cells. Myofilaments, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, and ribosomes were seen in the cytoplasm.
Conclusion
These results indicate that FGF-2 can transfect and induce differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Lentivirus-mediated FGF-2 transfection induces the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells better than FGF-2 direct induction.

Abstract: Summary
Manipulation of energy-dissipating adipocytes has the potential to produce metabolic benefits. To this end, it is valuable to understand the mechanisms controlling the generation and function of thermogenic fat. Here, we identify Letm1 domain containing 1 (Letmd1) as a regulator of brown fat formation and function. The expression of Letmd1 is induced in brown fat by cold exposure and by β-adrenergic activation. Letmd1-deficient mice exhibit severe cold intolerance concomitant with abnormal brown fat morphology, reduced thermogenic gene expression, and low mitochondrial content. The null mice exhibit impaired β3-adrenoreceptor-dependent thermogenesis and are prone to diet-induced obesity and defective glucose disposal. Letmd1 was previously described as a mitochondrial protein, and we find that it also localizes to the nucleus and interacts with the transcriptional coregulator and chromatin remodeler Brg1/Smarca4, thus providing a way to impact thermogenic gene expression. Our study uncovers a role for Letmd1 as a key regulatory component of adaptive thermogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depends on extensive association with the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton for its structure and mitotic inheritance. However, mechanisms that underlie coupling of ER membranes to MTs are poorly understood. We have identified thousand and one amino acid kinase 2 (TAOK2) as a pleiotropic protein kinase that mediates tethering of ER to MTs. In human cells, TAOK2 localizes in distinct ER subdomains via transmembrane helices and an adjacent amphipathic region. Through its C-terminal tail, TAOK2 directly binds MTs, coupling ER membranes to the MT cytoskeleton. In TAOK2 knockout cells, although ER-membrane dynamics are increased, movement of ER along growing MT plus ends is disrupted. ER-MT tethering is tightly regulated by catalytic activity of TAOK2, perturbation of which leads to defects in ER morphology, association with MTs, and cell division. Our study identifies TAOK2 as an ER-MT tether and reveals a kinase-regulated mechanism for control of ER dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor CHD1 is essential for the assembly of variant histone H3.3 into paternal chromatin during sperm chromatin remodeling in fertilized eggs. It remains unclear, however, if CHD1 has a similar role in normal diploid cells. Using a specifically tailored quantitative mass spectrometry approach, we show that Chd1 disruption results in reduced H3.3 levels in heads of Chd1 mutant flies. Chd1 deletion perturbs brain chromatin structure in a similar way as H3.3 deletion and leads to global de-repression of transcription. The physiological consequences are reduced food intake, metabolic alterations, and shortened lifespan. Notably, brain-specific CHD1 expression rescues these phenotypes. We further demonstrate a strong genetic interaction between Chd1 and H3.3 chaperone Hira. Thus, our findings establish CHD1 as a factor required for the assembly of H3.3-containing chromatin in adult cells and suggest a crucial role for CHD1 in the brain as a regulator of organismal health and longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is one of the most widely used vaccines worldwide. In addition to protection against tuberculosis, BCG confers a degree of non-specific protection against other infections by enhancing secondary immune responses to heterologous pathogens, termed “trained immunity.” To better understand BCG-induced immune reprogramming, we perform single-cell transcriptomic measurements before and after BCG vaccination using secondary immune stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We find that BCG reduces systemic inflammation and identify 75 genes with altered LPS responses, including inflammatory mediators such as CCL3 and CCL4 that have a heightened response. Co-expression analysis reveals that gene modules containing these cytokines lose coordination after BCG. Other modules exhibit increased coordination, including several humanin nuclear isoforms that we confirm induce trained immunity in vitro. Our results link in vivo BCG administration to single-cell transcriptomic changes, validated in human genetics experiments, and highlight genes that are putatively responsible for non-specific protective effects of BCG.

Abstract: Summary
Projections from sensory neurons of olfactory systems coalesce into glomeruli in the brain. The Kirrel receptors are believed to homodimerize via their ectodomains and help separate sensory neuron axons into Kirrel2- or Kirrel3-expressing glomeruli. Here, we present the crystal structures of homodimeric Kirrel receptors and show that the closely related Kirrel2 and Kirrel3 have evolved specific sets of polar and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, disallowing heterodimerization while preserving homodimerization, likely resulting in proper segregation and coalescence of Kirrel-expressing axons into glomeruli. We show that the dimerization interface at the N-terminal immunoglobulin (IG) domains is necessary and sufficient to create homodimers and fail to find evidence for a secondary interaction site in Kirrel ectodomains. Furthermore, we show that abolishing dimerization of Kirrel3 in vivo leads to improper formation of glomeruli in the mouse accessory olfactory bulb as observed in Kirrel3−/− animals. Our results provide evidence for Kirrel3 homodimerization controlling axonal coalescence.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired synaptic neurotransmission may underly circuit alterations contributing to behavioral autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotypes. A critical component of impairments reported in somatosensory and prefrontal cortex of ASD mouse models are parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. However, it remains unknown whether PV interneurons mediating hippocampal networks crucial to navigation and memory processing are similarly impaired. Using PV-labeled transgenic mice, a battery of behavioral assays, in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology, and in vivo 32-channel silicon probe local field potential recordings, we address this question in a Cntnap2-null mutant mouse model representing a human ASD risk factor gene. Cntnap2−/− mice show a reduction in hippocampal PV interneuron density, reduced inhibitory input to CA1 pyramidal cells, deficits in spatial discrimination ability, and frequency-dependent circuit changes within the hippocampus, including alterations in gamma oscillations, sharp-wave ripples, and theta-gamma modulation. Our findings highlight hippocampal involvement in ASD and implicate interneurons as a potential therapeutical target.

Abstract: Summary
Microdroplet single-cell ATAC-seq is widely used to measure chromatin accessibility, however, highly scalable and simple sample multiplexing procedures are not available. Here, we present a transposome-assisted single nucleus barcoding approach for ATAC-seq (SNuBar-ATAC) that utilizes a single oligonucleotide adaptor for multiplexing samples during the existing tagmentation step and does not require a pre-labeling procedure. The accuracy and scalability of SNuBar-ATAC was evaluated using cell line mixture experiments. We applied SNuBar-ATAC to investigate treatment-induced chromatin accessibility dynamics by multiplexing 28 mice with lung tumors that received different combinations of chemo, radiation, and targeted immunotherapy. We also applied SNuBar-ATAC to study spatial epigenetic heterogeneity by multiplexing 32 regions from a human breast tissue. Additionally, we show that SNuBar can multiplex single cell ATAC and RNA multiomic assays in cell lines and human breast tissue samples. Our data show that SNuBar is a highly accurate, easy-to-use, and scalable system for multiplexing scATAC-seq and scATAC and RNA co-assay experiments.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance can occur in patients receiving adoptive cell therapy (ACT) due to antigen-loss-variant (ALV) cancer cell outgrowth. Here we demonstrate that murine and human T helper (Th) 9 cells, but not Th1/Tc1 or Th17 cells, expressing tumor-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), eradicate advanced tumors that contain ALVs. This unprecedented antitumor capacity of Th9 cells is attributed to both enhanced direct tumor cell killing and bystander antitumor effects promoted by intratumor release of interferon (IFN) α/β. Mechanistically, tumor-specific Th9 cells increase the intratumor accumulation of extracellular ATP (eATP; released from dying tumor cells), because of a unique feature of Th9 cells that lack the expression of ATP degrading ectoenzyme cluster of differentiation (CD) 39. Intratumor enrichment of eATP promotes the monocyte infiltration and stimulates their production of IFNα/β by inducing eATP-endogenous retrovirus-Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)/mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) pathway activation. These results identify tumor-specific Th9 cells as a unique T cell subset endowed with the unprecedented capacity to eliminate ALVs for curative responses.

Abstract: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a mesenchymal malignancy with a complex karyotype. Despite accumulated evidence, the factors contributing to the development of LMS are unclear. Here, we investigated the role of tight-junction protein 1 (TJP1), a membrane-associated intercellular barrier protein during the development of LMS and the tumor microenvironment. We orthotopically transplanted SK-LMS-1 cells and their derivatives in terms of TJP1 expression by intramuscular injection, such as SK-LMS-1 Sh-Control cells and SK-LMS-1 Sh-TJP1. We observed robust tumor growth in mice transplanted with LMS cell lines expressing TJP1 while no tumor mass was found in mice transplanted with SK-LMS-1 Sh-TJP1 cells with silenced TJP1 expression. Tissues from mice were stained and further analyzed to clarify the effects of TJP1 expression on tumor development and the tumor microenvironment. To identify the TJP1-dependent factors important in the development of LMS, genes with altered expression were selected in SK-LMS-1 cells such as cyclinD1, CSF1 and so on. The top 10% of highly expressed genes in LMS tissues were obtained from public databases. Further analysis revealed two clusters related to cell proliferation and the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, integrated analyses of the gene expression networks revealed correlations among TJP1, CSF1 and CTLA4 at the mRNA level, suggesting a possible role for TJP1 in the immune environment. Taken together, these results imply that TJP1 contributes to the development of sarcoma by proliferation through modulating cell-cell aggregation and communication through cytokines in the tumor microenvironment and might be a beneficial therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Depression symptoms are often found in patients suffering from chronic pain, a phenomenon that is yet to be understood mechanistically. Here, we systematically investigate the cellular mechanisms and circuits underlying the chronic-pain-induced depression behavior. We show that the development of chronic pain is accompanied by depressive-like behaviors in a mouse model of trigeminal neuralgia. In parallel, we observe increased activity of the dopaminergic (DA) neuron in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), and inhibition of this elevated VTA DA neuron activity reverses the behavioral manifestations of depression. Further studies establish a pathway of glutamatergic projections from the spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Sp5C) to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) and then to the VTA. These glutamatergic projections form a direct circuit that controls the development of the depression-like behavior under the state of the chronic neuropathic pain.

Abstract: Summary
RBFOX2, which has a well-established role in alternative splicing, is linked to heart diseases. However, it is unclear whether RBFOX2 has other roles in RNA processing that can influence gene expression in muscle cells, contributing to heart disease. Here, we employ both 3ʹ-end and nanopore cDNA sequencing to reveal a previously unrecognized role for RBFOX2 in maintaining alternative polyadenylation (APA) signatures in myoblasts. RBFOX2-mediated APA modulates mRNA levels and/or isoform expression of a collection of genes, including contractile and mitochondrial genes. Depletion of RBFOX2 adversely affects mitochondrial health in myoblasts, correlating with disrupted APA of mitochondrial gene Slc25a4. Mechanistically, RBFOX2 regulation of Slc25a4 APA is mediated through consensus RBFOX2 binding motifs near the distal polyadenylation site, enforcing the use of the proximal polyadenylation site. In sum, our results unveil a role for RBFOX2 in fine-tuning expression of mitochondrial and contractile genes via APA in myoblasts relevant to heart diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Behaviorally relevant sounds are often composed of distinct acoustic units organized into specific temporal sequences. The meaning of such sound sequences can therefore be fully recognized only when they have terminated. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of sound sequences remain unclear. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of behaving mice to test the hypothesis that neural responses to termination of sound sequences (“Off-responses”) encode their acoustic history and behavioral salience. We find that auditory cortical Off-responses encode preceding sound sequences and that learning to associate a sound sequence with a reward induces enhancement of Off-responses relative to responses during the sound sequence (“On-responses”). Furthermore, learning enhances network-level discriminability of sound sequences by Off-responses. Last, learning-induced plasticity of Off-responses but not On-responses lasts to the next day. These findings identify auditory cortical Off-responses as a key neural signature of acquired sound-sequence salience.

Abstract: Summary
T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation involve metabolic reprogramming resulting from the interplay of genes, proteins, and metabolites. Here, we aim to understand the metabolic pathways involved in the activation and functional differentiation of human CD4+ T cell subsets (T helper [Th]1, Th2, Th17, and induced regulatory T [iTreg] cells). Here, we combine genome-scale metabolic modeling, gene expression data, and targeted and non-targeted lipidomics experiments, together with in vitro gene knockdown experiments, and show that human CD4+ T cells undergo specific metabolic changes during activation and functional differentiation. In addition, we confirm the importance of ceramide and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathways in Th17 differentiation and effector functions. Through in vitro gene knockdown experiments, we substantiate the requirement of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a de novo sphingolipid pathway in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-17A and IL17F) by Th17 cells. Our findings provide a comprehensive resource for selective manipulation of CD4+ T cells under disease conditions characterized by an imbalance of Th17/natural Treg (nTreg) cells.

Abstract: Summary
GABA can depolarize immature neurons close to the action potential (AP) threshold in development and adult neurogenesis. Nevertheless, GABAergic synapses effectively inhibit AP firing in newborn granule cells of the adult hippocampus as early as two weeks post-mitosis. The underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. Here, we analyze GABAergic inputs in newborn hippocampal granule cells mediated by soma-targeting parvalbumin and dendrite-targeting somatostatin interneurons. Surprisingly, both interneuron subtypes activate α5-subunit-containing GABAA receptors (α5-GABAARs) in young neurons, showing a nonlinear voltage dependence with increasing conductance around the AP threshold. By contrast, in mature cells, parvalbumin interneurons mediate linear GABAergic synaptic currents lacking α5-subunits, while somatostatin interneurons continue to target nonlinear α5-GABAARs. Computational modeling shows that the voltage-dependent amplification of α5-GABAAR opening in young neurons is crucial for inhibition of AP firing to generate balanced and sparse firing activity, even with depolarized GABA reversal potential.

Abstract: Summary
WNTs play key roles in development and disease, signaling through Frizzled (FZD) seven-pass transmembrane receptors and numerous co-receptors including ROR and RYK family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We describe crystal structures and WNT-binding characteristics of extracellular regions from the Drosophila ROR and RYK orthologs Nrk (neurospecific receptor tyrosine kinase) and Derailed-2 (Drl-2), which bind WNTs though a FZD-related cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and WNT-inhibitory factor (WIF) domain respectively. Our crystal structures suggest that neither Nrk nor Drl-2 can accommodate the acyl chain typically attached to WNTs. The Nrk CRD contains a deeply buried bound fatty acid, unlikely to be exchangeable. The Drl-2 WIF domain lacks the lipid-binding site seen in WIF-1. We also find that recombinant DWnt-5 can bind Drosophila ROR and RYK orthologs despite lacking an acyl chain. Alongside analyses of WNT/receptor interaction sites, our structures provide further insight into how WNTs may recruit RTK co-receptors into signaling complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody transfer via breastmilk represents an evolutionary strategy to boost immunity in early life. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies have been observed in the breastmilk, the functional quality of these antibodies remains unclear. Here, we apply systems serology to characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in maternal serum and breastmilk to compare the functional characteristics of antibodies in these fluids. Distinct SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are observed in the serum and breastmilk of lactating individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with a more dominant transfer of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM into breastmilk. Although IgGs are present in breastmilk, they are functionally attenuated. We observe preferential transfer of antibodies capable of eliciting neutrophil phagocytosis and neutralization compared to other functions, pointing to selective transfer of certain functional antibodies to breastmilk. These data highlight the preferential transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgM to breastmilk, accompanied by select IgG subpopulations, positioned to create a non-pathologic but protective barrier against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Abstract: Summary
The process of implantation and the cellular interactions at the embryo-maternal interface are intrinsically difficult to analyze, as the implanting embryo is concealed by the uterine tissues. Therefore, the mechanisms mediating the interconnection of the embryo and the mother are poorly understood. Here, we established a 3D biomimetic culture environment that harbors the key features of the murine implantation niche. This culture system enabled direct analysis of trophoblast invasion and revealed the first embryonic interactions with the maternal vasculature. We found that implantation is mediated by the collective migration of penetrating strands of trophoblast giant cells, which acquire the expression of vascular receptors, ligands, and adhesion molecules, assembling a network for communication with the maternal blood vessels. In particular, Pdgf signaling cues promote the establishment of the heterologous contacts. Together, the biomimetic platform and our findings thereof elucidate the hidden dynamics of the early interactions at the implantation site.

Abstract: Label-free optical diffraction tomography (ODT), an imaging technology that does not require fluorescent labeling or other pre-processing, can overcome the limitations of conventional cell imaging technologies, such as fluorescence and electron microscopy. In this study, we used ODT to characterize the cellular organelles of three different stem cells—namely, human liver derived stem cell, human umbilical cord matrix derived mesenchymal stem cell, and human induced pluripotent stem cell—based on their refractive index and volume of organelles. The physical property of each stem cell was compared with that of fibroblast. Based on our findings, the characteristic physical properties of specific stem cells can be quantitatively distinguished based on their refractive index and volume of cellular organelles. Altogether, the method employed herein could aid in the distinction of living stem cells from normal cells without the use of fluorescence or specific biomarkers.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) show variable differentiation potential due to their epigenomic heterogeneity, whose extent/attributes remain unclear, except for well-studied elements/chromosomes such as imprints and the X chromosomes. Here, we show that seven hiPSC lines with variable germline potential exhibit substantial epigenomic heterogeneity, despite their uniform transcriptomes. Nearly a quarter of autosomal regions bear potentially differential chromatin modifications, with promoters/CpG islands for H3K27me3/H2AK119ub1 and evolutionarily young retrotransposons for H3K4me3. We identify 145 large autosomal blocks (≥100 kb) with differential H3K9me3 enrichment, many of which are lamina-associated domains (LADs) in somatic but not in embryonic stem cells. A majority of these epigenomic heterogeneities are independent of genetic variations. We identify an X chromosome state with chromosome-wide H3K9me3 that stably prevents X chromosome erosion. Importantly, the germline potential of female hiPSCs correlates with X chromosome inactivation. We propose that inherent genomic properties, including CpG density, transposons, and LADs, engender epigenomic heterogeneity in hiPSCs.
