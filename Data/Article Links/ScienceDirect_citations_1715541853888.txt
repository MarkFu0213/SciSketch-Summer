Abstract: In this paper, the use of hot solvent vapor (HSV) annealing is demonstrated to improve the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) fabricated by the spray process. The blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) is used as a photoactive layer of the solar cell. Compared to the conventional solvent vapor annealing, the HSV annealing can eliminate the formation of intra-droplet boundary during the spray process and optimize the nanostructure of the film quickly (≤5min). The study of conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) reveals that the HSV annealed film exhibits smooth film surface and homogenous conductivity distribution. Moreover, an enhanced light harvesting and increased crystallinity of P3HT in the active layer are observed by UV–vis absorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD). With subsequent thermal annealing, the power conversion efficiency of solar cell made from the HSV annealed film is reached at 3.61%. This HSV annealing technique can be implemented into the fabrication of high efficient large-area PSCs using the spray process.

Abstract: CDC6 is an important component of the pre-replication complex and plays an essential role in the regulation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Deregulation of CDC6 protein levels results in rereplication and genomic instability. CDC6 expression is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. One major mechanism of cell cycle dependent regulation of CDC6 is APCCdh1 mediated protein ubiquitination and degradation during G1 phase. In addition to APCCdh1 dependent degradation, alternative, Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligase dependent degradation pathways have been characterized in yeast. Here we studied whether Cullin RING E3 ligases also play a role in the turnover of CDC6 protein in mammalian cells. To this end, we used the Nedd8 E1 inhibitor MLN4924, which blocks the activity of all Cullin E3 ligases. We observed that treatment with MLN4924 increased CDC6 protein expression. However, this effect was due to a delay in cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, resulting in accumulation of cells with high CDC6 protein levels. Therefore, our results indicate that Cullin E3 ligases are not involved in the basal turnover of CDC6 in mammalian cells. Interestingly, we also found that the DNA cross-linker mitomycin C induces marked CDC6 protein degradation. Mitomycin C induced CDC6 degradation is not mediated by APCCdh1, Cullin or HUWE1 E3 ubiquitin ligases. Notably, mitomycin C mediated CDC6 degradation requires the neddylation pathway. Our results provide evidence for a novel, cullin independent mechanism of CDC6 posttranslational regulation upon DNA damage that involves the neddylation pathway.

Abstract: The advantages of high mechanical flexibility of organic polymers that are suitable for the roll-to-roll processing technique have recently assisted its fast progress towards fabricating large-area organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices on flexible substrates including plastics and metals. We fabricated the inverted OPV devices on various metals namely: stainless steel (SS), titanium coated steel (Ti-S), chromium coated aluminium (Cr-Al), and aluminium (Al). Around 3.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved on the SS and Cr-Al substrates for the poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (P3HT:PCBM) OPV devices while only 1.48% PCE of the OPV devices was obtained on the Ti-S substrate and no effective devices were presented on the Al substrate. Morphologies of the metal substrates and the active P3HT:PCBM layer were investigated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the tapping mode atomic force microscope (AFM), separately. We revealed why different metal substrates can provide significantly different performance for the inverted OPV devices by the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Abstract: The authors have successfully developed “W-textured” ZnO:B-coated soda-lime glass substrates with higher haze value and lower reflectance and thus, improved light-trapping effect, especially, in the long wavelength region. In order to obtain higher efficiency the authors have applied here this technique to a white glass substrate which has higher transmittance. The authors have investigated the relationship between its refractive index on each side of the glass before RIE etching and the RMS roughness of ZnO:B layer coated by the MOCVD method (on either side of the glass) after etching. For the surface morphology of the ZnO:B layer deposited on the side of the RIE-etched white glass with lower refractive index, it was found, in this study, that it shows mountain-chain-like double texture with higher haze value. Whereas ZnO:B layers deposited on soda-lime glass (SLG) investigated in a previous study, have cauliflower-like morphology and lower haze values. By using the newly developed white glass substrates, a higher short-circuit current density Jsc could be obtained corresponding to an improved spectral response, especially in the long wavelength regions (>500nm). As a result, the a-Si:H/µc-Si:H solar cell fabricated on this newly developed substrate has an initial efficiency of 13.2% which is higher than the one for substrates based on soda-lime glass. This shows that this newly developed W-textured substrate is a promising solution for the deposition of high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Background and objectives
Umbilical cord blood is an important source of stem cells. However, isolating multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from umbilical cord blood presents methodological challenges. We compared the effectiveness of six approaches to improve the success rate of MSC isolation and proliferation from umbilical cord blood.
Methods
Thirty umbilical cord blood units underwent investigation. In 10 samples, MNCs from each sample were divided into four groups to test the effect of negative immunodepletion (NI) alone (group A); NI plus basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) supplementation together (group B); bFGF supplementation alone (group C); and culture with neither NI nor bFGF (group D). The cells of each group were isolated from 10mL of umbilical cord blood. For investigating the effect of sample volume (group E) and MesenCult Proliferation Kits (group F), cells were isolated from 45±2ml. MSCs were identified on the basis of morphological, flow cytometric and differentiation potential characteristics.
Results
In groups of A–D, one week after the initial seeding, the cells showed a rounded appearance, and in the fourth week, many of them died. MSCs outgrowth was seen in 40% of the samples from group F, and this yield was further enhanced to 60% in cultures done with the MesenCult Proliferation Kit (group F). The fibroblast-like cells expanded rapidly and showed features of MSCs.
Conclusion
Sample volume was the parameter that showed the greatest influence on the isolation yield of MSCs from umbilical cord blood. This could be further enhanced by adding the MesenCult Proliferation Kit.

Abstract: A new accepter unit, pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole-2,5-dione, deserves much attention as the electron-deficient unit for the generation of electron donor material for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). Pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole-2,5-dione unit, regioisomer of the known pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione, is originated from the structure of stable synthetic pigment. The organic low band gap molecules with pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole-2,5-dione, thiophene and triphenyl amine units were synthesized using Suzuki polymerization to generate SM-B, SM-M and SM-H. The spectrum of SM-B as the solid thin film shows absorption band with maximum peaks at 356 and 517nm, and the absorption onset at 667nm, corresponding to band gap of 1.86eV. The device comprising SM-B and PC71BM (1:4) showed a VOC of 0.79V, a JSC of 6.04mA/cm2, and a FF of 0.33, giving a power conversion efficiency of 1.56%.

Abstract: P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and β1 integrin play essential roles in T cell trafficking during inflammation. E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 are their ligands expressed on inflammation-activated endothelium. During the tethering and rolling of lymphocytes on endothelium, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 binds E-selectin and induces signals. Subsequently, β1 integrin is activated and mediates stable adhesion. However, the intracellular signal pathways from PSGL-1 to β1 integrin have not yet been fully understood. Here, we find that p85, a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, forms a novel complex with Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2, a lymphocyte-specific RhoGTPases dissociation inhibitor. Phosporylations of the p85-bound Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 on 130 and 153 tyrosine residues by c-Abl and Src were required for the complex to be recruited to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and thereby regulate β1 integrin-mediated T cell adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Both shRNAs to Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 and p85 and over-expression of Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 Y130F and Y153F significantly reduced the above-mentioned adhesion. Although Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 in the p85-Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 complex was also phosphorylated on 24 tyrosine residue by Syk, the phosphorylation is not required for the adhesion. Taken together, we find that specific phosphorylations on 130 and 153 tyrosine residues of p85-bound Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 are pivotal for P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1-induced β1 integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. This will shed new light on the mechanisms that connect leukocyte initial rolling with subsequent adhesion.

Abstract: Recent studies of thin-film CdS/CdTe photovoltaic (PV) devices have suggested that a significantly higher device performance will not be achieved unless recombination in the CdTe is reduced. Although some control of CdTe recombination has been achieved historically through the careful incorporation of oxygen, chlorine, and copper, we believe a more promising avenue to higher device performance is by controlling the defects in the as-deposited CdTe. This is supported by theoretical studies that suggest much of the improvement associated with oxygen, chlorine, and copper is due to the interaction of these species with intrinsic defects related to cadmium and tellurium vacancies, interstitials, and anti-sites in the bulk as well as within the grain boundary regions. Several research projects at NREL are currently focused on altering CdTe deposition and post-deposition processes to allow for enhanced control of the as-deposited intrinsic defects. This paper discusses initial results in which process changes expected to alter the as-deposited defects are also observed to affect junction evolution and device functionality.

Abstract: In this work we propose the use of a plasma dry etching technique to condition the morphology of a silicon surface. The low environmental impacted NF3 halogen compound is adopted together with Ar to perform a multi-step process which helps to enhance the silicon surface texturing, thus reducing the time needed for the whole dry etching procedure, which also include saw damage removal on silicon wafers. A detailed study of surface reflectance and etching rate as a function of the dry plasma process parameters is discussed to achieve suitable multi-crystalline silicon surfaces for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: The colored solar–thermal collectors have the advantages of architectural integration and color appearance. The solar selective absorbing coatings with a metal–dielectric multilayer structure can show different colors by changing the layer number and thickness. In this work, five colored coatings with a metal titanium (Ti) and dielectric aluminum nitride (AlN) multilayer structure were designed by the optical multilayer software and fabricated by magnetron sputtering. The color of the five coatings is black, purple, yellowish green, red, and yellowish orange. The energy performance, chromaticity, and brightness of the coatings were studied and compared. The results show that the solar absorbance of these coatings is between 0.82 and 0.94, the thermal emittance is between 0.05 and 0.27, and the brightness is in the range of 0.65–8.89%. These colored coatings can be produced by a commercial production process, and is suitable for the application of building integration.

Abstract: We have carried out microstructural studies of secondary phase formation at the Mo/CuIn(Se,S)2 interface, and of grain structure in hydrazine solution-processed CuIn(Se,S)2 films. The CuIn(Se,S)2 layers were deposited on Mo-coated glasses followed by thermal annealing under a nitrogen ambient. In our previous work, we identified [Cu6S4]2− and [In2(Se,S)4]2− as the two major molecular species present in hydrazine CuIn(Se,S)2 precursor solutions. The CuIn(Se,S)2 films prepared by the precursor solution containing only above two molecular complexes exhibited the undesired secondary interfacial phases such as CuSe and CuIn5S8. It is likely that the reactions between the Mo bottom electrode with sulfur in [Cu6S4]2− can result in the formation of a MoS2 phase, triggering the phase separation of CuIn(Se,S)2 into CuSe and CuIn5S8. To make matters worse, the final CuIn(Se,S)2 films contain a lot of voids that reduce the structural and electrical integrity of the device. The addition of polyselenide molecules [Se]n into the above CuIn(Se,S)2 precursor solutions introduced MoSe2 rather than MoS2 at the back interface which in turn allows sulfur to remain in [Cu6S4]2− complexes. As a result, only the desired phases, CuIn(Se,S)2 and MoSe2, were formed near the back interface. Furthermore, The formation of voids within the film can be also prevented by adding [Se]n into the CuIn(Se,S)2 precursor solution, leading to the formation of a dense film structure.

Abstract: A novel highly-reflective thin film with self-cleaning properties consisting of TiO2–SiO2–Ag was successfully prepared by magnetron sputtering for solar front reflectors. The reflectivity of the film was experimentally tested and for comparison with values predicted from Essential Macleod Program (EMP). The effect of annealing temperature on the thin film structure, morphology, hydrophilic and photocatalytic properties was detailedly studied. Thereafter, the sequent tests were performed to investigate the influence of annealing temperature and thickness on the thin film reflectivity and aging properties. The results show that the TiO2 layer can form an excellent rutile structure with particles sized around 42nm when annealed at about 500°C. When increasing annealing temperature, the reflectivity of the film peaks at 400°C while the hydrophilcity is characterized with a continuous growth. Though reflectivity of prepared film indicates a declining trend, it still vibrates in an uncertain range when increasing the film thickness gradually. In comparison with predicted values, an optimal structure of thin film is: glass/Ag (130nm)/SiO2 (400nm)/TiO2 (300nm), with a reflectivity about 0.9601 and excellent hydrophilcity when annealed at about 500 °C. Finally, this prepared film can maintain a stable and high reflectivity at 0.9578 after a 1200h aging test, indicating potential application in solar front reflectors.

Abstract: This paper describes for the first time a feasible strategy to prepare efficient hybrid solar cells that combine ideal bulk-heterojunction architecture and wide spectral response in ternary photoactive layer. CuInS2 quantum dots (CuInS2-QDs) with different sizes were controllably synthesized by the solvothermal method; MEH-PPV–CuInS2 hybrids for harvesting photons in a broad spectral range up to 900nm were prepared by blending CuInS2-QDs with poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV), in which CuInS2-QDs aggregate into continuous and highly condensed interpenetrating nanochannels with the presence of effective MEH-PPV/CuInS2 interface for the energy transfer from MEH-PPV to CuInS2-QDs. Solar cells were fabricated by using the MEH-PPV–CuInS2 hybrids as light-harvester and vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod array (TiO2-NA) as a straightforward electron transporter, producing MEH-PPV–CuInS2/TiO2-NA devices with a ternary photoactive layer, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.60% was achieved under AM1.5 illumination. Compared to MEH-PPV/TiO2-NA binary solar cells, MEH-PPV–CuInS2/TiO2-NA ternary devices exhibit a much larger photocurrent and thereby efficiency. It is demonstrated that, in the ternary solar cells, photocurrent generation correlates dominantly with the light absorption property of MEH-PPV–CuInS2 hybrids, while open-circuit voltage is still mainly determined by the energy difference between the conduction band edge of TiO2 nanorods and the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the polymer. Based on the morphology and band alignments in the ternary system, the contributions of CuInS2-QDs to device performance and the related charge generation and transport processes are described.

Abstract: We investigated the degradation behavior of polymer/fullerene solar cells processed at different working pressures during the deposition of the metal back electrode by physical vapor deposition (PVD). The temporal development of the photovoltaic parameters was determined with a homemade automated degradation setup for constant irradiation of ∼1000W/m2 in air. The initial device efficiency improved with evacuation time. The device stability itself depended also on the PVD working pressure: the larger the PVD pressure, the more pronounced was the fast decay of the performance. As reactive remnants, still present within the evaporation chamber due to the larger PVD working pressure, seemed to contribute to the so-called device “burn-in”, yielding overall stronger decays for larger PVD working pressures. As a consequence a trade-off between final base working pressure and pumping time seems to be a requirement for cost-effective industrial evaporation processes.

Abstract: This paper considers sub-bandgap photon absorption in an InAs/GaAs quantum dot matrix. Absorption coefficients are calculated for transitions from the extended states in the valence band to confined states in the conduction band. This completes a previous body of work in which transitions between bound states were calculated. The calculations are based on the empirical k·p Hamiltonian considering the quantum dots as parallelepipeds. The extended states may be only partially extended—in one or two dimensions—or extended in all three dimensions. It is found that extended-to-bound transitions are, in general, weaker than bound-to-bound transitions, and that the former are weaker when the initial state is extended in more coordinates. This study is of direct application to the research of intermediate band solar cells and other semiconductor devices based on light absorption in semiconductors nanostructured with quantum dots.

Abstract: Aberrant aggregation of neurofilament proteins is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, neurofilament light protein (NEFL) mutants causing Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease induce misassembly of neurofilaments. This study demonstrated that mutations in different functional domains of NEFL have different effects on filament assembly and susceptibility to interventions to restore function. The mouse NEFL mutants, NEFLQ333P and NEFLP8R, exhibited different assembly properties in SW13-cells, cells lacking endogenous intermediate filaments, indicating different consequences of these mutations on the biochemical properties of NEFL. The p.Q333P mutation caused reversible misfolding of the protein. NEFLQ333P could be refolded and form coil–coiled dimers, in vitro using chaotropic agent, and in cultured cells by induction of HSPA1 and HSPB1. Celastrol, an inducer of chaperone proteins, induced HSPA1 expression in motor neurons and prevented the formation of neurofilament inclusions and mitochondrial shortening induced by expression of NEFLQ333P, but not in sensory neurons. Conversely, celastrol had a protective effect against the toxicity of NEFLP8R, a mutant which is sensitive to HSBP1 but not HSPA1 chaperoning, only in large-sized sensory neurons, not in motor neurons. Importantly, sensory and motor neurons do not respond identically to celastrol and different chaperones are upregulated by the same treatment. Thus, effective therapy of CMT not only depends on the identity of the mutated gene, but the consequences of the specific mutation on the properties of the protein and the neuronal population targeted.

Abstract: An improved texturing process is reported for industrial monocrystalline silicon wafers, which uses a small amount of liquid potassium silicate as an additive to the conventional KOH/IPA texturing process. The new silicate additive does not require any other changes to the chemical components and thus can easily be integrated into the standard industrial process. Reflectivity and scanning electron microscope studies confirm that the new process yields smaller pyramidal structures of about 4–6μm in height, with an improved uniformity across the entire Si surface resulting in a low solar weighted average reflectance (WAR) in the range 11.4–12.2%. Moreover a near three-fold decrease in IPA consumption and a six-fold increase in bath lifetime are achieved by the new texturing process compared to the standard texturing process. For 156mm×156mm pseudo-square CZ monocrystalline p-type silicon wafers cell efficiencies of over 18% are achieved with the new texturing process on industrial-grade, screen-printed solar cells fabricated on SERIS' industrial R&D pilot line. This process offers the potential for significant cost reduction in manufacturing of monocrystalline silicon wafer solar cells.

Abstract: We investigated penetration-type semi-transparent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells that incorporated cuprite (Cu2O) thin films, deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering, as the color-adjusting layer. Depending on the arrangement of the Cu2O and transparent conductive oxide layers in the cells, the cells could be classified as either inner-type or outer-type. By simulating and experimentally measuring the reflectance of both types of cells, it was found that the optical interference in the two cells had a more significant effect on the short-circuit current density than did the thickness of the incorporated Cu2O films. We fabricated a-Si:H cells whose transparency and color could be controlled simultaneously. This technique of fabricating a-Si:H cells that exploit the phenomenon of interference can be used to realize cells that exhibit different colors.

Abstract: Two novel crystalline complexes (C10H21NH3)2CuCl4(s) and (C11H23NH3)2CuCl4(s) (abbreviated as C10Cu(s) and C11Cu(s)), which may be used as the phase change materials, were synthesized by liquid phase reaction. Crystal structures and chemical compositions of the two complexes were determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction technique, chemical analysis and elemental analysis. Low-temperature heat capacities of the two new phase change materials were measured by a precise automatic adiabatic calorimeter in the temperature range from 78 to 395K. The temperatures, molar enthalpies and entropies of the phase transitions for each of the two complexes were determined to be: for (C10Cu(s)), 310.64±0.05K, 81.12±0.11kJ/mol, and (261.24±0.06) J/Kmol for the first peak, 315.17±0.04K, 10.17±0.52kJ/mol, and 32.28±1.66J/Kmol for the second peak; for (C11Cu(s)), they were 311.39±0.69K, 70.17±0.25kJ/mol, and 225.36±0.66J/Kmol for the first peak, 321.85±0.46K, 10.58±0.26kJ/mol, and 32.86± 0.07J/Kmol for the second peak, respectively. Two polynomial equations of the heat capacities as a function of temperature were fitted by the least-square method. Smoothed heat capacities and thermodynamic functions of the two phase change materials were calculated based on the fitted polynomial equations. In addition, the solid–solid phase transitions and melting processes of the two complexes were verified by DSC and TG techniques, and the reversibility and repeatability of the two phase transitions for each of the two complexes were discussed.

Abstract: Sumoylation modulates many proteins implicated in apoptosis such as Fas, TNFR1, Daxx, p53 and its regulator MDM2. Some of these proteins, such as DRP-1, are involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The intrinsic pathway is regulated at the mitochondrial level by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The small-molecule inhibitor BH3I-2′ binds to the hydrophobic groove of the BH3 domain of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Following treatment with this inhibitor in various experimental conditions, we observed decreased levels of detergent-soluble SUMO-1, an increase in the relative levels of detergent-insoluble sumoylated proteins, or both. Accordingly, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the relative numbers and intensities of endogenously or exogenously expressed SUMO-1 foci in the nucleus were increased following BH3I-2′ treatment. MG132 caused a large increase in steady-state levels of SUMO-1 and of sumoylated proteins, and this was especially true for detergent-insoluble proteins. The conjugation-incompetent GG-to-AA SUMO-1 mutant, which did not form nuclear foci, was only present in the detergent-soluble lysate fraction and was insensitive to BH3I-2′, implying that BH3I-2′ specifically affects SUMO in its conjugated form. Finally, BH3I-2′ had similar effects on SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 as it had on SUMO-1. In conclusion, BH3I-2′ causes an intracellular redistribution of sumoylated proteins, more specifically their targeting to PML and non-PML nuclear bodies in which they may be degraded by the proteasome. Interestingly, knocking down Bcl-2 also altered levels of sumoylated proteins and their presence in detergent-insoluble compartments, confirming the role of Bcl-2 as a modulator of the sumoylation pathway.

Abstract: The present article gives a summary of recent technological and scientific developments in the field of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film solar cells on foreign substrates. Cost-effective fabrication methods and cheap substrate materials make poly-Si thin-film solar cells promising candidates for photovoltaics. However, it is still the challenge for research and development to achieve the necessary high electrical material quality known from crystalline Si wafers on glass as a prerequisite to harvest the advantages of thin-film technologies. A wide variety of poly-Si thin-film solar cell approaches has been investigated in the past years, such as thermal solid phase crystallization – the only technology that had already been matured to industrial production so far – the seed layer concept where a large-grained seed layer is epitaxially thickened, direct growth of fine grained material, and liquid phase crystallization methods by laser or electron beam. In the first part of this paper, the status of these four different poly-Si thin-film solar cell concepts is summarized, by comparing the technological fabrication methods, as well as the structural and electrical properties and solar cell performances of the respective materials. In the second part, three promising technologies are described in more detail due to their highly auspicious properties regarding material quality and throughput aspects during fabrication: (1) High-rate electron–beam evaporation of silicon for the low-cost deposition of high-quality material, (2) large-area periodic nano- and micro-structuring of poly-Si by the use of imprinted substrates providing a large absorption enhancement by a factor of six at a wavelength of 900nm, (3) liquid-phase crystallization of silicon thin-film solar cells by electron–beam, yielding an excellent poly-Si material quality reflected by an open-circuit voltage of 582mV which has been achieved only very recently. A successful combination of these three complementary technologies is envisaged to be the basis for a prospective low-cost and highly efficient poly-Si solar cell device.

Abstract: We report on the photovoltaic (PV) effect of inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PV layer consisting of a donor-conjugated polymer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and an acceptor of [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixed with an interface-engineering additive of poly(oxyethylene tridecyl ether) (PTE). The electron-selective layer used is sol–gel processed zinc oxide (ZnO), and the anode layer is silver (Ag). Improved performance was achieved using the PTE additive in the BHJ PV layer of the inverted PSCs. A 1.77wt% mixing level of PTE into a blended P3HT:PCBM PV layer with a ratio of 1.00:0.73 produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.14%, which was much higher than the reference device (2.77%) without PTE. This improvement can be attributed to not only the improved carrier transport due to the PTEs at the interfaces between the BHJ PV layer and the electrodes, but also the increased carrier lifetime due to the PTE molecules at the interfaces between the phase-separated BHJ domains. These results suggest that the BHJ PV layer mixed with the PTE interface-engineering additive is a promising functional composite material system for use in efficient inverted polymer PV cells.

Abstract: A new conjugated polymer containing pentaselenophene (5Se) electron donor moieties was designed for use in polymer solar cells and synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction. The structure, optical properties, electrochemical properties, hole mobility, photovoltaic properties, and AFM morphology of the homopolymer (P5Se) and the donor–acceptor copolymer (P5SeDTDPP) with a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor were investigated and are discussed. The polymers showed good solubility, film-forming properties, and thermal stabilities. P5Se exhibited a broad absorption across the visible range, 400–700nm, which is a prerequisite for photovoltaic applications. P5SeDTDPP yielded a broader absorption spectrum, enhanced π–π interactions, and a lower band gap compared to P5Se, due to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer interactions between the donating moiety (pentaselenophene) and the DPP accepting moiety. Solution-processed field effect transistors fabricated from these polymers displayed p-type organic thin film transistor characteristics. P5Se and P5SeDTDPP exhibited typical p-type organic semiconductor characteristics with hole mobilities of 2.3×10−3 and 1.2×10–2cm2V−1s−1, respectively. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using polymer:PCBM blends in ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/Al structures. The P5SeDTDPP device exhibited an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.44V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 10.67mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.51, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.40% under AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) conditions.

Abstract: The present work reports preparation of an electrochromic device based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) modified ZnO nanowires. The vertically aligned ZnO nanowires, being 70nm in diameter, were prepared as a template by hydrothermal process on 65nm ZnO seed layer sputtered on transparent conductive fluorine doped tine oxide substrate. PEDOT was synthesized by electropolymerization using two approaches. The first was prepared at 1.6V constant potential (CP) and the second by 0–2V cyclic voltammetry (CV). The PEDOT nanotubes were successfully grown on ZnO nanowires array by CV electrochemical polymerization but CP method led to formation of PEDOT thin film. The average wall thickness of nanotubes was 20nm. The CV and CP electrodes and devices were characterized by scanning electron microscope, cyclic voltammetry analysis and UV–visible spectrophotometery to study the effect of preparation method on electrode morphology and device stability, response time (tR) and contrast. The CV approach gave rise to tR and contrast of 66ms and 46.1%, respectively; CP method resulted in tR and contrast of 300ms and 37.84%, respectively. While the conventional thin films had response time in order of second.

Abstract: The fabrication of organic electronics devices onto flexible polymer substrates by roll-to-roll (r2r) processes requires the use of in-line quality control tools for the optimization of the optical and electronic properties of semiconducting, electrodes and barrier layers and their thickness that will achieve the required performance and lifetime of the devices. This paper focuses of the investigation of the optical properties of r2r printed nanolayers for organic photovoltaics, by in-line spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) in the visible-far ultraviolet spectral region. This is performed by a prototype very fast stand-alone SE unit adapted onto a lab-scale r2r system. First, we test the stability and precision of measurements to validate the optical measurements and the analysis procedure. Afterward, we report on the robust determination of the thickness and optical properties of barrier thin layers (a combination of SiOx and hybrid polymer bilayers), PEDOT:PSS transparent electrodes and polymer:fullerene (P3HT:PCBM) blends that were gravure printed onto flexible PET substrates in the form of rolls. Finally, we discuss on the effect of the experimental parameters on the optical properties and the quality of the printed nanolayers as determined by the modeling approaches of the in-line measurements.

Abstract: All-trans retinoic acid plays an important role in nervous system development. However, the effects of all-trans retinoic acid on the neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and the mechanisms through which this differentiation takes place are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the biological effects of all-trans retinoic acid on the neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and the signaling pathways that mediated these effects. We found that the neuronal differentiation efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells following all-trans retinoic acid pre-induction was greater and the axonal length was longer than was observed with mesenchymal stem cells that were not pre-induced. mRNA and protein levels of the neural-markers Nestin, NSE, MAP-2, Tau and Tuj1 were stronger in neural-like cells derived from all-trans retinoic acid-pretreated mesenchymal stem cells than in those not pre-induction. Interestingly, the neuronal excitability of differentiated neural-like cells exhibited the same patterns between these two groups. Clear expression of retinoic acid receptor alpha and gamma in mesenchymal stem cells was observed, while retinoic acid receptor beta was barely detected. However, retinoic acid receptor beta expression in mesenchymal stem cells after neuronal induction increased dramatically, in contrast with retinoic acid receptor alpha and gamma expression, and retinoic acid receptor beta expression in mesenchymal stem cells receiving all-trans retinoic acid pre-induction was even stronger. Next, retinoic acid receptor alpha, beta and gamma were over-expressed by recombinant adenovirus infection prior to neuronal induction. Retinoic acid receptor alpha and gamma over-expression did not impact the neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. However, retinoic acid receptor beta over-expression promoted neuronal differentiation to a similar level as observed following all-trans retinoic acid pre-induction. The neuronal differentiation promoting effects of all-trans retinoic acid on mesenchymal stem cells could be inhibited by siRNA silencing of retinoic acid receptor beta and by LE135, an inhibitor of retinoic acid receptor beta. Taken together, these results suggest that all-trans retinoic acid pre-induction facilitates the neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. These facilitation effects are achieved by activating the retinoic acid receptor beta signaling pathway.

Abstract: Viruses often have strategies for preventing host cell apoptosis, which antagonizes viral replication. Borna disease virus (BDV) is a neurotropic RNA virus that establishes a non-cytolytic persistent infection. Although BDV suppresses type I Interferon (IFN) through (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) associated BDV P protein, it is still unclear how BDV can survive in the host cell and establish a persistent infection. Recently, it has been recognized that mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway is a crucial component of the innate immune response. In this work we show that BDV X protein colocalizes and interacts with MAVS in the mitochondria to block programmed cell death. BDV X protein-mediated inhibition of apoptosis was independent of type I IFN production and NF-κB activity. The reduction of BDV X expression with RNA interference (RNAi) or the mutation of BDV X enhanced MAVS-induced cell death. Collectively, our data provide novel insights into how BDV X protein inhibits antiviral-associated programmed cell death, through its action of MAVS function.

Abstract: Lattice matched triple-junction solar cells based on the materials Ga0.50In0.50P, Ga0.99In0.01As, and Ge are widely used in space and concentrator applications. In this study, the three subcells of this structure are investigated individually using component solar cells. The investigation covers a broad range of operating conditions, namely temperatures T from 5 to 170°C and concentration ratios C from 1 to 3000. The temperature dependence of the external quantum efficiencies is analyzed. Further, the I–V-characteristics are analyzed in light of varying temperature and irradiance. The influence of temperature on current-matching is discussed. Special emphasis is given to the Ge bottom cell I–V-curve which collapses at high temperatures. Increasing irradiance counteracts this effect, however series resistance becomes influential. It is shown that at high temperatures the Ge cell can contribute negatively to the power output of the triple-junction device. The limit temperature, defined as the temperature where the open circuit voltage VOC of a cell vanishes, is determined from extrapolation of the measurements using an analytical model of VOC(T,C) and the influence of irradiance is discussed. It is shown, that for the Ge bottom cell the limit temperature lies in the range of operating conditions for space missions close to the sun and approaches operating conditions in CPVT applications.

Abstract: Open-cell nickel foams with 92% porosity and uniform pore size and distribution were used in this study. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the behaviour of Ni-foam, when treated as volumetric receivers under concentrated solar radiation while improving their oxidation resistance, in order to make them attractive for such applications. The experimental investigation showed that their efficiency was depending on both materials parameters and flow conditions, the latter affecting the pressure drop and the heat transfer behaviour. The microstructural characterisation of oxide surface morphologies formed on the open-cell Ni foams exposed to concentrated solar radiation is investigated by the use of SEM and EDXS. SEM observations revealed a rapid homogeneous oxidation in the Ni-foam with three different surface oxide structures formed in relation with the process temperature. A novel slurry-based process for aluminising nickel foams while retaining their geometrical properties is applied in order to develop an aluminide–nickel intermetallic coating on a Ni foam thus enhancing the oxidation resistance. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were applied to assess the effectiveness of the aluminising process and determine the optimum parameters of the procedure (slurry composition, holding temperature and time).

Abstract: In this paper the tradeoff between process control and cost-effectiveness for PERL-type process flows is investigated. Three aspects are considered: (1) whether a surface pre-treatment (for example special cleans and/or oxidation) prior to the deposition of the Al2O3-based rear-side passivation stack has to be added to the flow; (2) the quantification of the impact on cell parameters of skipping the rear-side polishing and/or the Al2O3 deposition; and (3) the possibility of replacing Al paste with PVD Al for rear side metallization. It is found that: (1) SPM-like cleans or thermal oxidation prior to Al2O3 deposition are useful steps to guarantee a stable Al2O3-based passivation process. (2) The efficiency drops by more than 1% by skipping the polishing, but only ≈0.15% by removing the Al2O3 from the passivation stack. Therefore, while rear-side polishing appears to be a necessary step for PERC/PERL technologies, the insertion of Al2O3 in the passivation stack could be traded off for a reduced production cost, depending on the (company-specific) details of cost-calculations. (3) Replacing Al paste with PVD Al for rear side metallization results in a deteriorated reflectance. The effect is larger for thinner passivation stacks. Although less advantageous in term of material costs with respect to PVD Al, screen-printed Al would therefore be the preferred choice for PERL cells featuring thin passivation stacks.

Abstract: Monolithically integrated Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2 (CIGS) submodules having a certified efficiency of as high as 15.9% (16 cells, a designated area of 69.6cm2) were successfully fabricated on flexible substrates with a newly developed structure. This proved not only to achieve high efficiencies, but also to enable implementation of a low-cost manufacturing technique: roll-to-roll processing and monolithical integration. The newly developed substrates have a laminated structure with an Al2O3 dielectric layer formed by anodization on stainless steel, and satisfy the crucial requirements for manufacturing flexible CIGS submodules, including thermal stability over 500°C, a well-matched coefficient of thermal expansion for CIGS, an absence of impurities in the CIGS, sufficient dielectric properties, flexibility for roll-to-roll processing, low weight, and low material costs. Therefore, fabrication of modules on this flexible substrate offers the following attractive merits: high efficiency, low cost, and easy installation. Until now, no flexible substrates have satisfied these requirements all at once, our substrate is the most promising candidate for attractive flexible CIGS modules instead of conventional rigid CIGS modules.

Abstract: Bulk heterojunction binary blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(2,3-dihexyl thieno(3,4-b)pyrazine) (pC6TP) and ternary blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly(2,3-dihexyl thieno(3,4-b)pyrazine) (pC6TP) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) have been prepared and studied. Previous work has shown that pC6TP lies in a select class of semiconducting polymeric materials capable of producing photocurrent at photon energies below 1.1eV. Here we report a fundamental study to probe the role of pC6TP in ternary blend devices with P3HT and PCBM and develop an equivalent circuit model for device function based on the concept of separate parallel binary devices. The excellent agreement between the calculated and measured open circuit voltages of the ternary blend devices validates the parallel circuit model and provides a pathway to the design of dedicated low band gap materials for these devices.

Abstract: Controlled growth of single-crystalline CdS branched nanorod arrays (B-NRs) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate is achieved by growing the branches on the pre-formed CdS straight nanorod arrays (NRs) via the hydrothermal approach. The branches are formed by epitaxial growth from the backbones, and no seeds or catalysts are involved in the synthesis process. The microstructures of the CdS B-NRs can be easily tuned by varying the reaction parameters. The structures of CdS B-NRs are characterized in detail by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with focused ion beam (FIB) cutting of the materials. The properties and application of the CdS B-NRs are assessed by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, photoelectrochemical cells and hybrid photovoltaic devices. Experimental results show that, compared to the straight NRs counterparts, the CdS B-NRs fabricated in this work exhibited significantly stronger light absorbability, remarkably enhanced photocurrents in photoelectrochemical cells, and an improvement of up to 92% in power conversion efficiency for hybrid solar cells. This work demonstrates clearly the advantages of the branched nanostructures over the straight one in device applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the effects of donor deposition rate on an organic photovoltaic device using bis(4-(N-(1-naphthyl)phenylamino)phenyl)fumaronitrile (NPAFN) as the donor. When the deposition rate of NPAFN increased from 0.03 to 0.5nm/s, the performance of the device improved from 1.98% to 2.3% due to significant enhancement in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 0.81 to 0.97V. With the aid of diode equation fitting, the improved VOC is attributed to the low saturation current caused by weak molecular interaction during the deposition of NPAFN at a high deposition rate. In order to understand the detail of the molecular interaction, the morphological property of NPAFN thin film with various deposition rates is investigated using atomic force microscopic images, which show the emergence of pinholes at low deposition rates as a result of strong molecular aggregation. Moreover, the weak molecular interaction is found to contribute to the low carrier mobility in NPAFN from the calculation of space charge limited current, leading to the considerably increased bulk resistance and reduced fill factor as the deposition rate increases. The detailed electrical properties of the NPAFN device were analyzed using impedance spectra.

Abstract: The use of a synthetic saponite-clay with different morphological features is proposed in this work as additive for DSSC solar cells electrolyte. The dilution of the synthesis gel allowed to decrease the saponite particle size from ca. 200nm to ca. 50nm and to obtain samples with different lamellae organization. The influence of these parameters on solar cell performances have been tested by dispersing 5wt% of the clay in Z-946 liquid electrolyte and using the dispersion as non-liquid electrolyte. The stability of saponite dispersions in methoxyproprionitrile solvent has been studied by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). The electrochemical characterization showed that the addition of the saponite sample with the largest particles does not influence the solar cell efficiency, whereas the use of electrolyte having saponite suspension with the smallest particle size led to an increase of solar cell efficiencies of 8% with respect to the reference cell. Finally, tests devoted to investigate the stability over the time of DSSC prepared by using quasi-solid saponite-based electrolytes have been carried out.

Abstract: Multi-junction photovoltaic devices include two or more component sub-cells which are electrically interconnected in series. At any power point, the current output of the total device is limited by the sub-cell with the smallest current density. Therefore, the maximum efficiency is reached when the sub-cells have equal current densities at their respective maximum power points. In this case the sub-cells are so called “power matched”. We report an experimental procedure in which the current–voltage characteristics of tandem solar cells can be measured under various irradiance spectra, i.e. under various short-circuit current matching conditions. This permits the probing of the optimized short circuit current mismatch, where the sub-cells are power matched, which is essential to define design rules for the tandem stack. The method applies well to devices where one of the sub-cells is metastable. We show that, in the case of thin-film silicon tandem cells, the optimum mismatch changes significantly after light induced degradation. Consequently, the degradation factor of such devices is shown to depend not only on material quality but also on the initial short circuit current matching. This experiment also provides relative quantification of the fill factors of each sub-cell. Our example suggests that a high bottom cell deposition rate can be detrimental to the fill factor of the top cell in the case of thin-film silicon tandem cells deposited in superstrate configuration.

Abstract: Rather consistent power conversion efficiencies have been achieved in organic solar cells throughout a wide range of active layer thicknesses (∼100nm to ∼800nm) by using a p-type polymer semiconductor with high hole transport mobility (∼1cm2V−1s−1) as the donor, and PC61BM as the acceptor. A comparison between standard and inverted device configurations demonstrates that the inverted configuration is more suitable for achieving thicker active layers when a high hole mobility donor is used. We attribute this to the longer hole collection path in the inverted structure, which can benefit from using a high hole mobility material. Our results will be very useful for the development of new semiconductor materials and the design of device structures for more feasible manufacturing of large area OPV devices via high speed roll-to-roll printing processes.

Abstract: We report on a solution processed reduced graphene oxide (rGO) thin films as anode buffer layer in organic solar cells. The spin-coated rGO, and zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films have been used to fabricate bulk heterojunction organic solar cells employing [poly({4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene}-2,6-diyl)-alt-({5-octythieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione}-1,3-diyl):fullerene (PBDTTPD:PCBM) blends as a photoactive layer. Atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photovoltaic measurements were performed to investigate the morphology, materials of processed thin films, and device performance of the fabricated devices. The ZnO also plays an important role in blocking holes, collecting electrons and serves as conducting channels to the cathode top electrode. A short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), increase when the rGO was introduced, which directly contributed to the improved efficiency to 4.8%.

Abstract: Triple-layer broadband abrasion-resistant antireflective (AR) coatings with excellent transmittance at 400–800nm were designed with the aid of thin film design software (TFCalc™). SiO2, TiO2 and SiO2–TiO2 hybrid thin films with refractive indices of 1.44, 2.20 and 1.71 for the up, middle and bottom layers, were dip-coated from SiO2, TiO2 and SiO2–TiO2 hybrid sols by sol–gel process, respectively. SiO2 and TiO2 sols were prepared using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT) as precursors and hydrochloric acid as catalyst. These designed triple-layer broadband AR coatings with an average transmittance as high as 98.4% at visible region were successfully obtained. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) was further used to modify the surface of the AR coatings, which greatly improved the hydrophobicity of the coatings, and thus gave the AR coatings some self-cleaning property. These triple-layer abrasion-resistant broadband AR coatings with excellent transmittance in the visible region have potential value in the field of solar cells.

Abstract: Protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) plays a major role in the regulation of glycogen biosynthesis. PP1 is recruited to sites of glycogen formation by its binding to specific targeting subunits. There, it dephosphorylates different enzymes involved in glycogen homeostasis leading to an activation of glycogen biosynthesis. Regulation of these targeting subunits is crucial, as excess of them leads to an enhancement of the action of PP1, which results in glycogen accumulation. In this work we present evidence that PPP1R3D (R6), one of the PP1 glycogenic targeting subunits, interacts physically with laforin, a glucan phosphatase involved in Lafora disease, a fatal type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Binding of R6 to laforin allows the ubiquitination of R6 by the E3-ubiquitin ligase malin, what targets R6 for autophagic degradation. As a result of the action of the laforin–malin complex on R6, its glycogenic activity is downregulated. Since R6 is expressed in brain, our results suggest that the laforin–malin complex downregulates the glycogenic activity of R6 present in neuron cells to prevent glycogen accumulation.

Abstract: The enhancement of Er3+-based up-conversion for photovoltaics in multilayer porous silicon photonic structures is considered theoretically and experimentally. Transfer matrix simulations are used to assess the increased photonic density of states that results from the slowing of energy propagation at the short-wavelength edge of one-dimensional photonic band gaps. An indirect calculation of Er3+ absorption enhancement within slow-light modes is then used to illustrate an increase in absorption over the bulk value: the effective absorption coefficient is shown to increase by more than 22% over a broad spectral region and by more than 400% over a narrow region. Erbium-doped porous silicon photonic crystals are fabricated with the photonic band edge coincident with the I15/24→I13/24Er3+ transition. Challenges in fabrication are discussed. An angular-dependent photoluminescence measurement demonstrates emission intensity that varies non-monotonically with the position of the photonic band edge. A maximum of 26.6×enhancement of Er3+ emission intensity is observed for the 550-nm transition, with lower enhancement factors seen for longer wavelengths.

Abstract: Several dielectric fluids that might be used for immersing optics are analyzed in this paper. Their transmittances, both before and after an accelerated exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation equivalent to several years under real sun, are presented. In addition, the photocurrent losses caused by the decrease in transmittance experienced by each fluid are estimated for current III–V multijunction (MJ) solar cells. The most stable fluids were found to be paraffin and silicone oils whose transmittances remained practically unaltered after a UV dosage equivalent to 3 years of AM1.5D radiation.

Abstract: The future development of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) as an alternative absorber for low cost and high efficiency thin film photovoltaic modules depends strongly on the understanding and control of the formation of secondary phases in this system. With this aim, a detailed chemical-physical characterization of Zn-rich CZTS films prepared by sulfurization of metallic stacks is presented, combining x-ray diffraction, Raman, and Auger spectroscopy. Under such conditions a reaction pathway for the formation of CZTS by a solid–liquid–gas reaction with binary compounds as intermediates is proposed. This is supported by the detailed depth-resolved analysis of the films annealed at different temperatures and times. The experimental data support a formation mechanism of CZTS that proceeds rapidly when a eutectic Cu2S+SnS mixture melts above 480°C, acting as a flux to react the remaining solid binary phases and sulfur gas present in the annealing atmosphere. During reaction Cu and Sn are completely consumed, while excess Zn segregates towards the back contact regions as shown by a combined Raman–Auger depth-resolved analysis. Using the presented thermal treatment process a device with 5.5% efficiency and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 79% is obtained.

Abstract: The evidence that androgen blockade-resistant prostate cancer, termed castration resistant, remains androgen receptor (AR) dependent is compelling. AR is re-activated through multiple mechanisms including expression of constitutively active splice variants that lack hormone binding domains (HBDs). This highlights the need to develop therapies that target regions other than the HBD. Because the p160 coactivators interact most strongly with the amino-terminus of AR, we examined the consequences of disrupting this interaction. We identified two overlapping SRC-1 peptides that interact with AR, but not with progesterone receptor. These peptides reduce AR and AR variant AR-V7 dependent induction of an AR responsive reporter. Using mammalian two hybrid assays, we found that the peptides interrupt the AR/SRC-1, AR/SRC-2 and AR N/C interactions, but not SRC-1/CARM-1 interactions. Consistent with the SRC-1 dependence of induced, but not repressed genes, in LNCaP cells, the peptides inhibited hormone dependent induction of endogenous target genes including PSA and TMPRSS2, but did not block AR dependent repression of UGT2B17 or inhibit vitamin D receptor activity. Simultaneous detection of SRC-1 peptides and PSA by double immunofluorescence in transfected LNCaP cells clearly demonstrated a strong reduction in PSA levels in cells expressing the peptides. The peptides also inhibited the AR dependent expression of PSA in castration resistant C4-2 cells. Moreover they inhibited androgen dependent proliferation of LNCaP cells and proliferation of C4-2 cells in androgen depleted medium without affecting AR negative PC-3 cells. Thus, the p160 coactivator binding site is a novel potential therapeutic target to inhibit AR activity.

Abstract: Several thermal annealing strategies are employed to account for the formation of PCBM aggregates in a blend of P3HT/PCBM thin films. Optical absorption spectroscopy reveals dependence of PCBM cluster formation upon different annealing strategies as indicated by optical microscopic images. Using Raman image mapping of the selected locations we were able to identify PCBM rich regions. Exciton generation rate as a function of thermal annealing is in good correlation with short circuit current density. The probability of exciton dissociation as a function of thermal annealing reveals an almost static behaviour in response to the temperature rise up to 75°C. The enhanced intensity of photoluminescence signal upon thermal annealing supports the increase in exciton generation rates resulting from formation of PCBM clusters and recrystallisation of P3HT domains, removing nonradiative recombination centres. Current density voltage characterisation reveals dependence of device parameters on thermal annealing strategies.

Abstract: Highest published power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells have mostly been achieved on substrates bearing a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. However, the incorporation of ITO is not suited for future industrial production processes of organic solar cells, which will rely on a high-throughput of flexible substrates in order to achieve low cost of the final product. In this manuscript we present an alternative transparent electrode consisting of a layer stack of aluminum doped zinc oxide and a thin silver layer. Substrates with these electrodes have a transparency of above 75% in the wavelength range in which the photoactive layer absorbs light. Solar cells with a bulk-heterojunction of PTB7 and PC71BM in an inverted device architecture achieved a power conversion efficiency of 6.1%, which is the highest reported value for polymer solar cells free from both ITO and PEDOT:PSS. The sheet resistance of the novel electrodes increased only marginally after repeated bending which shows their full compatibility with future reel-to-reel processes or flexible products.

Abstract: Iron pyrite is a promising material for photovoltaic power production due to low material extraction and processing costs and high optical absorption. Reliable production of photovoltaic grade iron pyrite thin films has, however, been challenging. One potential fabrication route is the direct conversion of iron-to-iron pyrite by sulfur annealing (sulfurization). Bulk iron thin films are used typically but they can suffer from cracking or delamination. Herein we report the sulfurization of porous, columnar Fe films deposited with Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD), which allows us to control the inter-column spacing (void-fraction) of the precursor film. We show that the morphology and microstructure of the iron pyrite films are strongly affected by the void-fraction. By precisely tuning the void-fraction of the precursor film at 82° oblique angle incidence deposition we can produce iron pyrite films with increased crystallite sizes >100nm with a uniform, crack-free, facetted granular microstructure. Large crystallites may reduce carrier recombination at grain boundaries, which is attractive for photovoltaic devices. Further increasing the void-fraction produces a columnar iron pyrite structure. We also report composition, electrical and optical characterization including a 27ps lifetime of photocarriers measured with ultrafast optical-pump/THz-probe. Structured, porous precursors offer an alternate route to control microstructure and film stress during fabrication of iron pyrite thin films.

Abstract: This work presents the design and synthesis of a series of novel 2-benzylquinuclidine derivatives, comprising 12 methiodide and 11 hydrochloride salts, and their structural and pharmacological characterization at the human (h) α7 and α4β2 nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). The antagonistic potency of these compounds was tested by Ca2+ influx assays on cells expressing the hα7 or hα4β2 nAChR subtype. To determine the inhibitory mechanisms, additional radioligand binding experiments were performed. The results indicate that the methiodides present the highest affinities for the hα7 nAChR agonist sites, while the same compounds bind preferably to the hα4β2 nAChR ion channel domain. These results indicate that the methiodides are competitive antagonists of the hα7 nAChR but noncompetitive antagonists of the hα4β2 subtype. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the methiodide derivative 8d binds to the hα7 orthosteric binding sites by forming stable cation-π interactions between the quaternized quinulinuim moiety and the aromatic box in the receptor, whereas compounds 7j and 8j block the hα4β2 AChR ion channel by interacting with a luminal domain formed between the serine (position 6′) and valine (position 13′) rings that overlaps the imipramine binding site.

Abstract: Nickel oxide (NiO) is the most common low-cost high-performance anodic electrochromic material that is widely used in the applications for smart windows. The coloration mechanism is, however, still not well understood and we show that this is due to the evolving chemical nature of the film during the electrochromic process. Chemical bath deposited (CBD) NiO was studied using the near-grazing incidence angle Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (NGIA FTIR) and endurance potential cycling. We will show that the initial hydration of NiO films toward Ni(OH)2 proceeds gradually through a combination of coloration from hydroxyl (OH−) ions and bleaching through H+ ions. This process increases the optical modulation of the deposited film. However, when the OH− ion diffusion is significantly enhanced, OH− ion incorporation during coloration will lead to water incorporation. The extensive intercalated networks can then isolate NiOOH grains that results in irreversible coloration and this is commonly reported as degradation. We will propose a model to show that an isolation process can explain this degradation and can be easily reversible by annealing. This understanding of the coloration and degradation mechanisms suggests that an optimum control of hydroxyl ions is critical for both efficiency and durability of NiO electrochromic devices.

Abstract: The alkanediol series such as 1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,8-octanediol and 1,10-decanediol was introduced to poly(3-hexylthiophene, P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) based bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells as processing additives. When 1,3-propanediol was introduced to photo-active layer as a processing additive, power conversion efficiency (PCE) was dramatically increased from 3.5% (for the reference device) to 5.3%. To investigate the causes of improvement of the PCE of PSCs after addition of alkanediol series, photon absorbance properties were observed using UV–vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL). Then, the degree of crystallinity of P3HT was examined through X-ray analysis. In addition, changes in the nano-structure and surface morphology of P3HT:PCBM blend film were observed through AFM and TEM. The series resistance (RS) of the fabricated PSCs was 5.19Ωcm2, and short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) were 16.2mA/cm2, 0.63V and 51.9% respectively.

Abstract: The free carrier generation processes at the interface formed by fullerene (C60) and perfluorinated hexadecafluorophthalo-cyaninatozinc (F16ZnPc) are investigated in detail. It is found that the exciton dissociation and recombination across the interface can happen at the same C60/F16ZnPc interface. And it is demonstrated in this study that both processes can be the dominant process for photocurrent generation by simply changing the direction of the built-in electric field. The observed superlinear dependence between photocurrent and light intensity confirms that the photocurrent indeed is the second order to the incident light intensity. Thus the photocurrent can be generated from the exciton recombination across the C60/F16ZnPc interface.

Abstract: Resistivity, ρ(T), in single crystals of p-Cu2ZnSnS4 is investigated in the temperature interval of T∼300−10K. Below ∼200K, ρ(T) exhibits an activated character obeying between ∼130−150K and ∼30−70K the Mott variable-range hopping conduction law. Analysis of the experimental data yields typical values of the relative acceptor concentration, N/Nc∼0.72−0.84, where Nc ≈8×1018cm−3 is the critical concentration of the metal–insulator transition (MIT), and those of a/aB∼3.5−6.4, where a is the localization radius and aB ≈13Å is the Bohr radius, respectively. Width of the acceptor band, W∼11−22meV, centered at the energy EB∼50−60meV above the top of the valence band, is estimated implying a high degree of the microscopic lattice disorder in the investigated p-Cu2ZnSnS4 samples. Typical values of the density of the localized states, g∼(1−3)×1017cm−3meV−1, are estimated, as well.

Abstract: A phase change material consisting of three-dimensional graphene aerogel (GA) and octadecanoic acid (OA) was produced. The GA was assembled from the sheets of graphene oxide in a hydrothermal reaction. The pore sizes of the network were several micrometers and the pore walls consisted of thin layers of stacked graphene sheets. OA was impregnated into GA by capillary forces, with the GA acting as the support. The GA/OA composite had a thermal conductivity about 2.635W/mK at a GA loading fraction of ∼20vol%, which was about 14 times that of the OA (0.184W/mK). The transient heating and cooling responses of the material were investigated for thermal energy storage. The GA had a low bulk density so that the weight percent of the GA in the composite was only about 15%. The composite presents a high heat storage capacity of 181.8J/g, which was very close to the value of the OA alone (186.1J/g).

Abstract: Outdoor stability testing of ionic liquid based dye sensitised solar cells under short circuit (SC) and open circuit (OC) modes has been followed using electroluminescence (EL) and transmission imaging. The study showed a significant influence of the ageing conditions on the stability of the solar cell parameters in the exposure period from zero up to 31kWh/m2 (four summer days) of solar irradiation. Initial exposure is beneficial for all performance parameters regardless the operating mode under which the cells were aged. After 8kWh/m2 ageing of the cells in SC mode downgrades all parameters, mainly Jsc and consequently η, while continues ageing in OC mode slightly increases Voc and consequently η. The EL imaging demonstrated that ageing, regardless the operating mode, is associated with the growth of the EL inactive areas that appear as black spots or defects, which we associate with the formation of iodine species in the electrolyte that have been captured under confocal microscope. The stability testing demonstrates that growth of the defects is more pronounced for cells operated in SC mode, which primarily reduces stability of Jsc.

Abstract: The thrombopoietin receptor is a crucial element in thrombopoietin-initiated signaling pathways, which stimulates the differentiation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, the maturation of megakaryocytes, and the generation of platelets. In this study, we identified a novel activating variant of thrombopoietin receptor, termed Mpl-D, in human megakaryoblastic leukemia Dami cells and demonstrated that the binding affinity of the Mpl-D receptor for thrombopoietin is enhanced. Cell cycle analysis revealed that in the presence of thrombopoietin, most Mpl-D expressing NIH3T3 (NIH3T3/Mpl-D) cells were prevalent in G1 phase while the S and G2/M populations were less frequently observed. Unexpectedly, thrombopoietin induced strong and prolonged ERK1/2 signaling in NIH3T3/Mpl-D cells compared with its receptor wild-type expressing NIH3T3 (NIH3T3/Mpl-F) cells. Further analysis of the mRNA levels of cyclin D1/D2 in NIH3T3/Mpl-D cells demonstrated markedly down-regulated expression compared to NIH3T3/Mpl-F cells in the presence of thrombopoietin. Thus, the prolonged activation of ERK1/2 by Mpl-D might lead to G1 cell cycle arrest through a profound reduction of cyclin D1/D2 in order to support cell survival without proliferation. We also provided tertiary structural basis for the Mpl-D and thrombopoietin interaction, which might provide insights into how Mpl-D effectively increases binding to thrombopoietin and significantly contributes to its specific signaling pathway. These results suggest a new paradigm for the regulation of cytokine receptor expression and function through the alternative splicing variant of Mpl in Dami cells, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of megakaryoblastic leukemia.

Abstract: The estimation of steady state and dynamic parameters is indispensable to extract maximum power from solar photovoltaic system. This article aims to extract steady state and dynamic parameters for a low-concentration photovoltaic system under actual test conditions. A theoretical model is reported to estimate dynamic resistance under varying concentration and temperature for low-concentration photovoltaic system. When the concentration ratio is changed from 1 sun to 5.17 suns the maximum power delivered by low-concentration photovoltaic system increased by threefold. The results show that the higher solar PV module temperature has negative impact on the open circuit voltage for a given concentration with negative temperature coefficient of ≈−0.021V/K. The observed dynamic resistance was in the range of 17.99 to 24.84Ω for the low-concentration photovoltaic system under actual test conditions.

Abstract: Of the materials of current research interest in thin-film photovoltaics, Ru and Te are amongst the nine rarest elements in the earth's crust, with In and Se in positions 11 and 14, raising the issue as to what constraints, if any, are placed on future thin-film photovoltaic manufacturing volumes by such scarcity. Te provides an interesting case study since more than 600t has been incorporated into CdTe modules fielded to-date, with CdTe technology recently consolidating its position as the most successful commercial thin-film technology. The origin and impacts of recent fluctuating Te market conditions are discussed as are new insights into long-term supply from Cu refining.

Abstract: We focus on the use of mixed-phase phosphorus-doped SiOx (n-SiOx) as advanced n-layer in both the junctions of micromorph tandem solar cells. The material, deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition at two pressure values, has been fully characterized. Direct evidence of phase separation into nanocrystalline Si and amorphous oxygen-rich phases is reported, accompanied by information on the optical properties of the material as a whole and the two phases, as gathered by spectroscopic ellispometry. The multifunctional role of the n-SiOx layer, providing for beneficial optical effects at both the intermediate and back reflecting stage in micromorph solar cells, is established. In particular superior performance (improved fill factor and enhanced bottom solar cell spectral response) is demonstrated with use at the rear side of the device in combination with a simple Ag back reflector, with respect to the standard device employing the conventional ZnO/Ag reflector.

Abstract: We present a soft method for the fabrication of well controlled plasmonic nanodots on large ITO substrate for organic solar cells. Masks of nanopatterned aluminum oxide are elaborated and deposited on ITO substrates before metal deposition. After removal of the mask, well organized and isolated metallic nanodots are observed. In this article, we focus on gold or silver nanostructures: they show a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) in the visible region, an important feature for their integration in organic thin film solar cells and the final improvement of the optical properties of the cell. In addition, their near field enhancement capacity is also clearly demonstrated by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and FDTD method simulation. An additional advantage of this protocol is that it can be used on any kind of surface and with different metals, depending on the final application.

The carboxyl tail of alpha-actinin-4 regulates its susceptibility to m-calpain and thus functions in cell migration and spreading,

Abstract: Alpha-actinin-4 links the cytoskeleton to sites of adhesion and has been shown to be modulated to enable cell migration. Such focal adhesions must be labile to accomplish migration, with this detachment occurring at least in part via m-calpain activation (Glading et al., 2001, Glading et al., 2002, Xie et al., 1998). In this study, we report that alpha-actinin-4 is initially cleaved by m-calpain between tyrosine 13 and glycine. Removal of the first 13 amino acids does not affect alpha-actinin-4 binding to actin filaments and its localization within fibroblasts but drives cell migration with less persistence. Binding of phosphoinositides PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 to alpha-actinin-4, as well as binding of alpha-actinin-4 to actin filaments all inhibit m-calpain cleavage of ACTN4 between tyrosine 13 and glycine 14. Interestingly, the carboxyl terminus of alpha-actinin-4 including its calcium binding motifs, is inhibitory for a secondary cleavage of alpha-actinin-4 between lysine 283 and valine 284. The minimal length of inhibitory domain is mapped to the last 11 amino acids of alpha-actinin-4. The C-terminal tail of alpha-actinin-4 is essential for maintaining its normal actin binding activity and localization within cytoplasm and also its colocalization with actin in the lamellipodia of locomoting fibroblasts. Live cell imaging reveals that the 1–890 fragment fails to rescue neither the basal or growth factor-stimulated migration nor the revert the spread area of fibroblasts to the level of NR6WT. These findings suggest that the C-terminal tail of alpha-actinin-4 is essential for its function in cell migration and adhesion to substratum.

Knockdown of FAM3B triggers cell apoptosis through p53-dependent pathway,

Abstract: FAM3B, also named PANDER, is a cytokine-like protein identified in 2002. Previous studies showed that FAM3B regulates glucose and lipid metabolism through interaction with liver and endocrine pancreas. FAM3B is also expressed by other tissues but its basic function is unclear. In this study, we found that FAM3B was expressed in mouse colon, intestine, liver and lung tissues and multiple types of cell lines, including murine pancreatic β-cell (Min6), microglia (N9) and muscle cell (C2C12); human colon cancer cells (HCT8, HCT116, HT29), hepatocyte (HL-7702), hepatocellular carcinoma cell (SMMC-7721) and lung carcinoma cell (A549). Inhibition of FAM3B expression by RNA interference induced apoptotic cell death of HCT8, HCT116, A549, N9, C2C12 and Min6 cells and decreased cell viability of HL-7702 and murine primary hepatocytes. Further studies with HCT8 cells showed that knockdown of FAM3B increased the protein levels of membrane-bound Fas and Bax, reduced the expression of Bcl-2, promoted the cleavage of caspases-8, -3, -9 and PARP, and the nuclear translocation of cleaved PARP. These results suggest that FAM3B silencing activates both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Mechanistic studies showed that neutralizing antibody against Fas or silencing Fas-associated death domain had no effect on, while caspase inhibitors could significantly reverse FAM3B knockdown induced apoptosis, suggesting Fas and death receptor mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway is not involved in FAM3B silencing induced apoptosis. Further studies showed that p53 was significantly upregulated after FAM3B knockdown. Silencing p53 could almost completely reverse FAM3B knockdown induced upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, cleavage of caspases-8, -9, -3, and apoptotic cell death, suggesting p53-dependent pathway plays critical roles in FAM3B silencing induced apoptosis. Studies with HCT116 cells confirmed that inhibition of FAM3B expression induced apoptosis through p53-dependent pathway. Furthermore, knockdown of FAM3B reduced the protein level of Mdm2 and promoted p53 phosphorylation. Taken together, our studies demonstrated that silencing FAM3B promoted p53 phosphorylation and induced p53 accumulation by decreasing Mdm2 expression, which resulted in apoptotic cell death.

Abstract: We report for the first time the use of a water-soluble, tungsten polyoxometalate H3PW12O40 (PW12-POM) as an efficient cathode interlayer incorporated into poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM-61) polymer solar cells. The short circuit photocurrent density of the PW12-POM modified device is enhanced by ∼40% the open circuit voltage increases from 0.61V to 0.65V and the fill factor from 0.36 to 0.41, resulting to a power conversion efficiency enhancement of ∼70% (from 1.57% for the reference to 2.7% for the PW12-POM modified device). The improvement is attributed to enhanced electron transfer/extraction at the PW12-POM/Al interface as a result of the favorable interfacial energy level alignment and possible enhancement of the local electric field due to the nanoscale morphology of the PW12-POM layer, as evidenced by AFM measurements. A reduced degradation rate was measured for PW12-POM modified devices stored in dark and measured in ambient conditions. Taking into account the advantageous solution processability of PW12-POM, the large increase in the device efficiency and the improvement of their stability, we manifest that PW12-POM has highly desirable properties in order to be embedded as cathode interlayer in organic photovoltaic cells.

Abstract: Fabrication of large-area anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) on glass substrates by using a cost-efficient and simple approach, especially for applications in photovoltaics, remains a challenge. This study proposes electrospinning as a technique to fabricate porous SiO2 ARCs on large-area glass substrates (20×20cm2). The existing electrospinning setup is modified to enable large-area glass coatings and electrospinning process parameters are optimized to achieve sub-wavelength ARCs. The post-sintered SiO2 ARC is thoroughly characterized for the film morphology and optical properties. The transmittance for one-side and both-sides coated glass is found to be 94.3% and 96% respectively. The anti-reflective glass is incorporated in solar modules to determine the increase in short circuit current. The increase in short-circuit current is found to be 3%. Electrospinning as a fabrication technique has potential in offering a cost effective solution for synthesizing ARCs on large-area substrates for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: We present our development of an n-μc-SiOx:H intermediate layer with low refractive index for a highly efficient Si thin film solar module in a large area (1.1×1.3m2). We try to increase the electron temperature (Te) in the plasma to activate the oxygen reaction during the deposition of the n-μc-SiOx:H intermediate layer. Thus, the Te-related process conditions are controlled, such as the gap between the electrodes, the working pressure and the H2 flow rate in the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. An intermediate layer with a lower refractive index is fabricated in narrower gap between the electrodes, lower working pressure and lower H2 flow rate. As a result, we obtain a superior intermediate layer with a refractive index of 1.73 on a large area substrate, vertically conductive enough for a favorable junction in the cell, as confirmed by conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) analysis. This intermediate layer is applied between the middle and the bottom layers in the triple junction (a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H/μc-Si:H) cell. A low refractive index leads to a higher current of the middle cell by the superior reflection. Our large area module gains 0.3% conversion efficiency, with an improvement in the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) by the thinner middle absorbing layer owing to the intermediate layer with a lower refractive index.

Abstract: Sodium is known to play an important role for the performance optimization of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) thin film solar cells, i.e. it is found to significantly increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC). For this work CIGSe absorbers were produced in a low temperature deposition process on polyimide substrates with varying sodium content. In agreement with previous studies we find an increase of VOC and overall solar cell performance with increasing sodium content and a decrease of the overall performance for very high sodium content. At the same time time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicate that the minority carrier lifetime decreases from 50ns to about 5ns for increasing sodium content in the absorber. This correlation was found to be valid for three different types of low-temperature CIGSe deposition processes. The results can be explained by an increase in deep defect density with increasing Na content, proportional to the increased net charge carrier density as measured by capacitance–voltage profiling. For very high sodium content this leads to an actual decrease in the overall performance of the solar cells.

Abstract: Boron doped amorphous silicon carbide/nanocrystalline silicon (p-type a-SiC/nc-Si) hybrid window layer has a great potential to improve the solar cells performance for its high optical band gap, carrier mobility and doping efficiency. Thin (<30nm) p-type a-SiC/nc-Si hybrid films have been successfully deposited by radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) from silane–methane gas mixtures at a low temperature of 150°C. Raman, FT-IR and HRTEM measurements were employed to investigate the structural characteristics of hybrid structure films. High quality p-type a-SiC/nc-Si hybrid window layer with controllable nano-sized silicon crystals embedded in amorphous silicon carbide matrix was obtained. Hybrid structure films with high values of optical band gap (∼2.2eV) and σd (∼10−3S/cm) were achieved in high hydrogen dilution conditions with optimized doping concentrations. Applying high quality p-type window layers and intrinsic a-Si layers, both high open circuit voltage (>0.96V) and high quantum efficiency values at short wavelengths were achieved for n–i–p type a-Si single junction solar cell. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the amorphous silicon and silicon–germanium (a-Si/a-SiGe) double junction solar cell was significantly improved to 11.8% by incorporating p-type a-SiC/nc-Si hybrid structure window layer.

Abstract: Breast cancer is currently the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in many countries, and paclitaxel is a cornerstone in the treatment of this malignancy. Unfortunately, the efficacy of paclitaxel is limited due to the development of drug resistance. Evidence has suggested that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in resistance to various forms of therapies, including chemotherapy. However, the interaction between paclitaxel resistance and CSCs and its underlying mechanisms have not been previously explored. In this study, we confirmed that paclitaxel enriched breast CSCs (CD44+/CD24−) in a dose-dependent manner in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. We then demonstrated that Notch1 was overexpressed in breast CSCs isolated from paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells compared to non-CSCs. The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated knock-down of Notch1 inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. The anti-apoptosis protein NF-κB was decreased significantly when treated with shRNA-Notch1, and this effect was sharply improved by combination with paclitaxel. Paclitaxel decreased CD44+/CD24− cell population in MCF-7 cells and reduced the size and number of primary mammospheres after down-regulating the Notch1. Furthermore, shRNA-Notch1 inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice noticeably. RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis showed that the expressions of ALDH1, NICD, Hes-1 and the drug transporter ABCG2 were decreased both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that Notch1 might play a critical role in the resistance to paclitaxel, and targeting Notch1 may have important clinical applications in cancer therapy.

Abstract: We investigate local electronic properties of cadmium telluride solar cells using electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements with patterned contacts. EBIC measurements are performed with a spatial resolution as high as ≈20nm both on the top surface and throughout the cross-section of the device, revealing a remarkable degree of electrical inhomogeneity near the p–n junction and enhanced carrier collection in the vicinity of grain boundaries (GB). Simulation results of low energy EBIC suggest that the band bending near a GB is downward, with a magnitude of at least 0.2eV for the most effective current-collecting GBs. Furthermore, we demonstrate a new approach to investigate local open-circuit voltage by applying an external bias across electrical contact with a point electron-beam injection. The length scale of the nanocontacts is on the length scale of a single or a few grains, confining current path with highly localized photo-generated carriers.

Abstract: In this work we present reflectance imaging as a suitable method for in situ monitoring of the drying process of film formation for organic photovoltaics (OPV) over large areas, as well as for lab-scale spin-coating. The drying wet film is illuminated with a narrow bandwidth LED with the specularly reflected light recorded by a video camera as the film dries and forms the active layer of the OPV cell. The interference fringes generated by the thinning wet film can be used to measure the rate of solvent evaporation and the drying time. Subsequent mapping elucidates variations in drying conditions over the substrate, which lead to variations in morphology formation. The technique is suitable for tracking thickness variations of the dry film, with a sensitivity of ≈10nm, by comparing the intensity of the reflected light from the dry film to simulated interference conditions calculated for each thickness. The drying process is furthermore accurately simulated by an optical model considering the changes in refractive index as the amount of solvent decreases with respect to the solid content. This non-invasive in situ method represents an important monitoring tool for future large scale OPV manufacturing where high performing morphologies with uniform thickness have to be formed over very large areas.

Abstract: Adenylate kinases regulate adenine nucleotide levels and are present in different intracellular compartments. These enzymes also participate in the activation of pharmacologically active nucleoside and nucleotide analogs. We have in the present study identified the ninth isoform of the adenylate kinase family of enzymes and accordingly named the protein adenylate kinase 9 (AK9). Initially a full-length cDNA of a hypothetical protein containing a predicted adenylate kinase domain was identified and subsequently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The substrate specificity of the recombinant protein showed that the enzyme catalyzed the phosphorylation of AMP, dAMP, CMP and dCMP with ATP as phosphate donor, while only AMP and CMP were phosphorylated when GTP was the phosphate donor. The kinetic parameters of AK9 were determined for AMP, dAMP and CMP with ATP as phosphate donor. Interestingly, in addition to the diphosphate products, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity was also present with subsequent triphosphates formed. With ATP or GTP as phosphate donor it was possible to detect the production of ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, dATP, dCTP, dGTP and TTP as enzymatic products from the corresponding diphosphate substrates. A number of previously characterized adenylate kinases were also tested and found to possess a broad phosphotransferase activity similar to AK9. These enzymes are accordingly suggested to be regarded as nucleoside mono- and diphosphate kinases with catalytic activities possibly determined by local substrate concentrations.

Abstract: The small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) regulates the transcription of a variety of target genes and controls a variety of physiological functions in various tissues. However, the role of SHP in beta cell has not been fully determined yet. We used SHP knockout (SHP KO) mice to investigate the role of SHP in multiple low-dose streptozotocin (MLDS)-induced diabetes. Blood glucose and insulin levels were measured until 20 days, and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion tests were performed. The expression of apoptotic genes and beta cell markers were detected by quantitative realtime-polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining and western blot analysis. SHP KO mice showed significantly lower blood glucose, higher insulin levels, and enhanced glucose tolerance compared with wild type (WT) mice after MLDS treatment. Moreover, beta cell mass and pancreatic insulin content were remarkably increased in SHP KO mice. In the response to glucose stimulation, islets of SHP KO showed increased insulin secretion via up-regulation of beta cell enriched transcription factors compared to WT mice after streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. In quantification for beta cell apoptosis at day 1 post STZ treatment, the SHP KO mice showed significantly increased anti-apoptotic gene expression and decreased release of apoptotic markers cytochrome c, smac/diablo, and only a few apoptotic beta cells were found in SHP KO pancreas through inactivation of caspase-3, compared to those of WT. These data demonstrate that SHP deficiency ameliorates hyperglycemia and preserves islet function by inhibiting apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells and up-regulating of their enriched transcriptional factors.

Abstract: For the first time, a novel rear contacting structure for copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) thin film solar cells is discussed theoretically, developed in an industrially viable way, and demonstrated in tangible devices. The proposed cell design reduces back contacting area by combining a rear surface passivation layer and nano-sized local point contacts. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 is used to passivate the CIGS surface and the formation of nano-sphere shaped precipitates in chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdS to generate point contact openings. The Al2O3 rear surface passivated CIGS solar cells with nano-sized local rear point contacts show a significant improvement in open circuit voltage (VOC) compared to unpassivated reference cells. Comparing the passivated devices to solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) modeling indicates that this increase is attributed to a decrease in rear surface recombination of a few orders.

Abstract: A new technique for the directional solidification growth of multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) ingot was developed by GCL-POLY Energy Holdings Ltd. This technique is called as S2 and has been used recently for industrial production. The average conversion efficiency of the solar cells fabricated by S2 mc-Si wafers is increased by 0.62% compared with the traditional mc-Si solar cells using conventional solar cell processing. In order to understand the origin of the high cell performance, ensure the process reproducibility and further improve the technique, this paper analyzes the grain structures of the S2 mc-Si wafers by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy supported with electron back scatter diffraction. Our analysis indicates that the increased performance of the S2 mc-Si solar cells is contributed to low dislocation density, uniform and highly oriented grains with high percentage of electrically inactive grain boundary (∑3 grain boundary).

Abstract: Adiponectin (Acrp30) exerts protective functions on metabolic and cellular processes as energy metabolism, cell proliferation and differentiation by two widely expressed receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. To date, the biological role of Acrp30 in lung has not been completely assessed but altered levels of Acrp30 and modulated expression of both AdipoRs have been related to establishment and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Here, we investigated the effects of Acrp30 on A549, a human alveolar epithelial cell line, showing how, in a time and dose-dependent manner, it decreases cell viability and increases apoptosis through ERK1/2 and AKT. Furthermore, we examined the effects of Acrp30 on A549 cells exposed to TNFa and/or IL-1ß, two potent lung inflammatory cytokines. We showed that Acrp30, in dose- and time-dependent manner, reduces cytotoxic effects of TNFa and/or IL-1ß improving cell viability and decreasing apoptosis. In addition, Acrp30 inhibits NF-?B nuclear trans-activation and induces the expression of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine without modifying that of pro-inflammatory IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 molecules via ERK1/2 and AKT. Finally, specifically silencing AdipoR1 or AdipoR2, we observed that NF-?B inhibition is mainly mediated by AdipoR1. Taken together, our data provides novel evidence for a direct effect of Acrp30 on the proliferation and inflammation status of A549 cells strongly supporting the hypothesis for a protective role of Acrp30 in lung. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the Acrp30 lung effects in vivo but our results confirm this adipokine as a promising therapeutic target in lung diseases.

Abstract: Ultra-thin WO3 nanorods (NRs) embedded polyaniline (PANI) composite thin films were synthesized by embedding WO3 NRs into polyaniline using a surface-initiated-polymerization method, followed by spin-coating deposition. The ultra-thin WO3 NRs with length of 60nm and diameter of 4nm were prepared by a solvothermal method. The nanofillers were well-dispersed in the polymer matrix. The nanocomposites were finally deposited onto ITO-coated glass via spin-coating technology. The electrochromic contrast, switching speed, and durability of the composite films were investigated in details. The composite film, being a dual electrochromic material, varied from purple to green, light yellow and finally dark blue. The switching speed (0.9s) is much faster than the films only composed of WO3 NRs. The durability of the hybrid film was enhanced compared with neat WO3 NRs film.

Abstract: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a rate limiting step in arachidonic acid cascade, plays a key role in the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) upon inflammatory stimuli, growth factors, hormones and other cellular stresses. Overproduction of PGE2 stimulates proliferation of various cancer cells, confers resistance to apoptosis and favors metastasis and angiogenesis. The steady-state level of PGE2 is maintained by interplay between the biosynthetic pathway including COX and PGE2 synthases and the catabolic pathways involving nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). 15-PGDH is a crucial enzyme responsible for the biological inactivation of PGE2. Adult hepatocytes fail to induce COX-2 expression regardless of the pro-inflammatory factors used. COX-2 is induced in hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy (PH), in animal models of cirrhosis, in human hepatoma cell lines, in human HCC and after HBV and HCV infection. However, no data are available regarding 15-PGDH expression in HCC. Our results show that 15-PGDH is downregulated in human hepatoma cells with a high COX-2 expression, in chemical and genetic murine models of HCC and in human HCC biopsies. Moreover, 15-PGDH expression is suppressed by EGF (epidermal growth factor) and HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) mainly involving PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activation. Conversely, ectopic expression of 15-PGDH induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells and decreases the growth of hepatoma cells in nude mice whereas the silencing of 15-PGDH increases the tumor formation. These data suggest a potential therapeutic application of 15-PGDH in HCC.

Abstract: Significant advances have been made in the recent years to improve the efficiency of single- and multi-junction solar cells incorporating nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H). The improvements have resulted from the development of high quality intrinsic material, novel doped layers, superior back reflector and appropriate device design. Stable active-area efficiency of 13.6% for small-area cells and aperture-area efficiency of 11.85% for large-area devices have been achieved. In this paper, we discuss the key activities that led to these high efficiencies with emphasis on substrate-type solar cells. Manufacturing issues and future research directions to improve efficiency further are also discussed.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of smoothening intermediate reflecting layers (IRLs) in Micromorph thin-film silicon tandem solar cells in the superstrate configuration. The aim of such structures is not only to provide a selective reflection of light for optimal light management in both sub-cells but also to tune the morphology of the surface on which the microcrystalline silicon bottom cell is grown. This novel type of IRL is shown to enable the use of rough front electrodes with excellent light scattering properties in Micromorph devices without impacting the electrical property of the microcrystalline material. A low-index (1.5), highly transparent and insulating UV-curable lacquer is used as IRL. The electrical contact between both sub-cells is ensured by a partial covering of this lacquer layer: the bottoms of the structure are efficiently filled whereas the tips are unveiled by an etching step. This results in an efficient smoothening of the surface of the top cell, validated by a Voc boost of up to 50mV compared to a standard IRL. A strong top cell current increase is also shown, with up to 2.3mA/cm2 (20% relative) current gain compared to a cell with no IRL. Adjusting the volume of lacquer composing this advanced interlayer enables a fine tuning of its opto-electrical properties. The introduction of a smoothening IRL is shown, with simple calculations, to be a key element towards the obtaining of 13.5% stable-efficiency Micromorph devices using present state-of-the-art single junctions.

Abstract: Recent reports indicate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can modulate tumor environment and promote angiogenesis through induction of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) production. We investigated the mechanism of PGE2-induced SDF-1 regulation in human prostate stromal cell and analyzed the effects in a stromal–epithelial interaction model. PGE2 stimulation increased SDF-1 expression in the prostate stromal cell lines WPMY-1 and NAF. We revealed signaling through the PGE2 receptor EP3 and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) are required. The EP3 agonist sulprostone and the cAMP analog forskolin mimicked and the EP3 siRNA, antagonist L798106 and the PKA inhibitor H89 abrogated the effect of PGE2 on SDF-1 expression. SDF-1 promoter truncation experiments demonstrated a 254bp (from nt −219 to nt +34) SDF-1 proximal promoter fragment containing 5 putative transcription factor Sp1 binding motifs is sufficient for PGE2 induction. CHIP assays confirmed binding and PGE2 induced recruitment of Sp1 to the SDF-1 promoter. Sp1 motif mutation identified Sp1 motifs −140/−133 and −9/+1 as the crucial elements responsible for PGE2 induction. Moreover, SDF-1 was up- or down-regulated by Sp1 over-expression or knock-down. We also demonstrate stimulation of migration of prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 with conditioned media collected from WPMY-1 or NAF cells stimulated with PGE2 and blockade of enhanced migration by a SDF-1 neutralizing antibody. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a paracrine prostate stromal–epithelial interaction induced by upregulation of expression of SDF-1 by PGE2. Our research provides new insights into the mechanism promoting metastasis of prostate carcinoma via stromal–epithelial interaction.

Abstract: Mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) has been suggested to participate in the attenuation of the reactive oxygen species production, but the mechanism of action and the physiological significance of UCP2 activity remain controversial. Here we tested the hypothesis that UCP2 provides feedback downregulation of oxidative stress in vivo via synergy with an H2O2-activated mitochondrial calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (mt-iPLA2). Tert-butylhydroperoxide or H2O2 induced free fatty acid release from mitochondrial membranes as detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, which was inhibited by r-bromoenol lactone (r-BEL) but not by its stereoisomer s-BEL, suggesting participation of mt-iPLA2γ isoform. Tert-butylhydroperoxide or H2O2 also induced increase in respiration and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in lung and spleen mitochondria from control but not UCP2-knockout mice. These data suggest that mt-iPLA2γ-dependent release of free fatty acids promotes UCP2-dependent uncoupling. Upon such uncoupling, mitochondrial superoxide formation decreased instantly also in the s-BEL presence, but not when mt-iPLA2 was blocked by R-BEL and not in mitochondria from UCP2-knockout mice. Mt-iPLA2γ was alternatively activated by H2O2 produced probably in conjunction with the electron-transferring flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETFQOR), acting in fatty acid β-oxidation. Palmitoyl-d,l-carnitine addition to mouse lung mitochondria, respiring with succinate plus rotenone, caused a respiration increase that was sensitive to r-BEL and insensitive to s-BEL. We thus demonstrate for the first time that UCP2, functional due to fatty acids released by redox-activated mt-iPLA2γ, suppresses mitochondrial superoxide production by its uncoupling action. In conclusion, H2O2-activated mt-iPLA2γ and UCP2 act in concert to protect against oxidative stress.

Abstract: We fabricated highly transparent and flexible poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/Ag nanowire (NW)/PEDOT:PSS (PAP) multilayer electrodes by continuous brush-painting for used as flexible anode in highly flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs). By combining the flexibility of PEDOT:PSS and low resistivity of Ag NWs, we fabricated highly flexible PAP multilayer electrodes with a low sheet resistance of 13.96Ω/square and a high diffusive transmittance of 80.48%. Effective embedment of the Ag NW network into the conductive PEDOT:PSS layer led to metallic conductivity and a high diffusive transmittance, which are desirable in transparent anodes for FOSCs. In addition, the PAP electrode showed an invariable resistance (ΔR/R0) during outer and inner bending testing, due to the high strain failure of both PEDOT:PSS and Ag NW network. The identical current density–voltage behavior of the FOSCs with the brush-painted PAP electrode as the FOSC with a conventional ITO electrode demonstrates that the brush-painted PAP multilayer is a promising alternative to high-cost ITO electrodes to produce cost-efficient FOSCs. Furthermore, we suggest that high-performance, transparent, and flexible electrodes can be fabricated by low-cost brush-painting for paintable FOSCs.

Abstract: A series of n-type copolymers based on dithienocoronene diimide with different number of thiophene units have been designed and synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling polymerization. The soluble polymers P1–P3 exhibit good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures of 340−390°C. The absorption spectra (400–700nm) red shift, and optical band gap (1.7–1.9eV) decreases with increasing thiophene number in the copolymers. The estimated LUMOs for these polymers (ca. −3.5eV) are relatively insensitive to thiophene number, while the HOMOs (−6.0 to −5.7eV) up shift with increasing thiophene number. Solution processed bulk heterojunction all-polymer solar cells are fabricated using polymers P1–P3 as acceptor and polythiophene derivative PT5TPA as donor. Power conversion efficiencies (upto 0.84%) increase with increasing thiophene number in the polymer acceptors.

Abstract: The effects of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) on NiO–TiO2 sols, xerogels and films have been studied. Xerogels and films with Ni concentration of 80mol% have been prepared using sols containing 3, 6, 9wt% of SDS added to nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O) and tetra-n-butyl titanate (TNBT) as precursors in a mixture of ethanol and n-butanol. The thermal analysis of dried xerogels has been measured by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) in air up to 500°C. The structural properties of xerogels sintered at 300°C have been determined by XRD and the xerogels consist predominantly of bunsenite nanoparticles embedded in an amorphous TiO2 phase. Single layers have been deposited by dip coating on FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide, SnO2:F) coated glasses and sintered at 300°C. Their thickness is found to increase with the SDS amount while the roughness of the surface is reduced. The electrochromic properties of films deposited on FTO coated glasses have been studied in 1M KOH aqueous electrolyte via cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and visible light transmission. The anodic and cathodic peaks in CV cycles and the charge intercalated during CA cycles increase with the SDS content. The transmission in the bleached and colored states as well as the change in optical density remain stable for the film prepared with 9wt% SDS up to almost 18,000 CA cycles, a great improvement compared to films prepared without surfactant. The coloration efficiency of the film prepared with 9wt% SDS is about 30cm2/C, a value comparable to that obtained for pure NiO film.

Abstract: Within a cell, the regulation of organelle positioning is considered to be critical in spatio-temporal responses. The position of late endocytic organelles (named here lysosomes for simplicity) is tightly controlled and has a functional impact on processes like endocytosis, phagocytosis and autophagocytosis. The cytoplasmic distribution profile of lysosomes can be easily determined in cells where the cytoplasm/nuclear ratio in a cross-section area is high. However, determining lysosomal position in cells with lower cytoplasm/nuclear ratio, such as macrophages is more challenging. Here, we describe a method that can be efficiently and accurately used to determine the position of organelles in macrophages using confocal microscopy in two-dimensional (2D) images. Using this approach in macrophages, we confirmed previous observations in epithelial cells that both changes in cytoplasmic pH and the levels of active Rab34 induced a re-distribution of lysosomes to the cell centre or periphery. Noteworthy is that this Rab34-dependent re-distribution of lysosomes did not significantly affect the spatial distribution profile of phagolysosomes in the cytoplasm. We conclude that although Rab34 regulates both lysosomal positioning and lysosome to phagosome fusion, the latter effect is not due to the regulation of the cytoplasmic accessibility of lysosomes to phagosomes by Rab34.

Abstract: In this work we report the relation between different secondary phases formation and the values of Cu/(Zn+Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films deposited by pneumatic spray pyrolysis using air as carrier gas. The films were grown on soda lime glass substrates via (CH3COO)2·Zn·2H2O, CuCl2·2H2O, SnCl2·2H2O and thiourea as precursors salts in the solution. The secondary phases present in the films were determined from Raman spectroscopy and the chemical composition of the elements from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements. Varying the growth parameters and post-deposition thermal and chemical KCN treatments we have studied the different secondary phases formation dependence on the values of the Cu/(Zn+Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios and its impact on the properties of polycrystalline thin films solar cells where CZTS is used as the absorber layer.

Abstract: This study evaluates the interface passivation quality of the amorphous/crystalline heterointerface and the performance of the heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer solar cells via values of a plasma parameter characterized by the deposition pressure (p)×electrode distance (d). Increasing the product of p×d leads to a lower crystalline fraction and higher hydrogen content, and enhances the c-Si surface passivation. This p×d evaluation factor is also compared with other evaluation factors, such as the silane depletion fraction and film-crystallinity. The tendencies of minority carrier lifetimes with respect to these evaluation factors were similar. Using the highest p×d value of 48, the photovoltaic parameter of the device yielded an open-circuit voltage of up to 710mV, in turned giving an efficiency of 19.12%.

Abstract: As solar photovoltaic (PV) installations have become more common in regions that experience substantial snowfall, losses in energy production due to snow coverage have grown in concern. Several post-production surface coatings have been proposed to enhance snow shedding to reduce these snow related losses. In this paper, a novel methodology is developed to determine the effectiveness of a snow clearing from a PV module and is used to evaluate the snow shedding effectiveness of any module surface treatment. Measured PV output is compared to modeled PV output in a generalizable method that allows for the determination of the length of time a panel is covered with snowfall using electrical performance data. This model accounts for module degradation during long-term outdoor testing and other external factors effecting performance, such as persistent soiling losses. This methodology was tested on modules that had one of four hydrodyanmic surface coatings, as well as one module with a prismatic glass front in order to determine the snow clearing effectiveness of these surfaces as compared to conventional plain glass. The methodology was validated, but the surface coatings tested did not have an appreciable positive effect on snow clearance, and in some cases tended to impede the shedding of snow. The physical mechanisms responsible for the results are discussed.

Abstract: We demonstrate that pitch-converted carbon nanosheet (CNS) films can efficiently function as transparent conducting electrodes for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The solution-processed CNS film was prepared with spin-coating of a cost-effective pitch solution dissolved in dimethylformamide on quartz substrates, followed by stabilization and carbonization treatments to convert the pitch into CNS. The pitch-converted CNS films prepared by the successive heat-treatment process were examined as a novel transparent anode in solar cells, and as a result, PSCs fabricated directly on such CNS electrodes exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of ∼1.7% under 100mWcm−2 illumination and AM 1.5G conditions. This approach could be highly desirable for advancing the realization of fully printable and flexible low-cost transparent electrodes for indium tin oxide (ITO)-free polymer solar cells.

Abstract: Bis-indene fullerene (ICBA) is a highly symmetric molecule that tends to diffuse and aggregate into larger clusters, resulting in a huge horizontal phase separation when the master solvent vaporizes, in addition to a significant drop in power conversion efficiency (PCE). We found that Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) blended with a high-molecular-weight polyvinylcarbazole (PVK) film could effectively prevent the clustering of ICBA crystalline molecules, thereby improving the phase separation. Furthermore, PVK dispersed the ICBA:P3HT active layer in a more uniform manner, increasing open circuit voltage (Voc) and reducing photocurrent loss. As a result, the PCE of the device can be improved from 2.2% to 4.5%.

Abstract: Cell-based therapies promise important developments for regenerative medicine purposes. Adipose tissue and the adipogenic process has become central to an increasing number of translational efforts in addition to plastic and reconstructive surgical applications. In recent experimental clinical trials, human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proven to be well tolerated because of their low immunoreactivity. MSC are multipotent cells found among mature cells in different tissues and organs with the potentiality to differentiate in many cell types, including osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes, thus being a suitable cell source for tissue engineering strategies. We compared the adipogenic potential of MSC originated from two adult sources as fat pads and bone marrow, and from four foetal sources as umbilical cord blood, Wharton's jelly, amniotic fluid and preterm umbilical cord perivascular cells. Surprisingly, adult MSC displayed higher differentiation capacities confirmed by gene expression analysis on a selected panel of adipogenesis-related genes. Further, an in-depth molecular analysis highlighted the early and vigorous activation of the PPARγ transcription factor-cascade in adipose-derived MSC that resulted to be both delayed and reduced in foetal MSC accounting for their lack of adipogenic potential. Thus, MSC show a different degree of phenotypic plasticity depending on the source tissue, that should be taken into consideration for the selection of the most appropriate MSC type for specific tissue regeneration purposes.

Abstract: Molybdenum oxide (MoOX) has drawn increasing attention in organic photovoltaic cells due to the large performance enhancement achieved in organic light emitting diodes. In this work, we report on inverted polymer photovoltaics (PVs) with solution-processed MoOX as anodic modification to enhance the performance of PVs. MoO3 is reduced to MoOX with x<3 after air-plasma treatment and then plays a role more closely to the thermally deposited MoOX, whose oxygen ratio is reduced during high temperature deposition. The reduced oxygen ratio provides more effective transport, thus enhancing the JSC of the devices. The PCE of the device with solution-processed MoOX is then enhanced to over 4%, which is comparable to that of thermally deposited MoOX. As a result, this work provides good compatibility for deposition of solution-process MoOX on top of polymer:fullerene blends in inverted polymer PVs to achieve better performance.

Abstract: Single phased copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2) films have been successfully prepared on titanium substrates directly by adopting a hydrothermally-assisted chemical bath deposition technique. CuInSe2 films belong to the chalcopyrite structure were uniformly prepared at various penetration depths. The synthesis temperature of the monophasic CuInSe2 films was decreased to 180°C without the selenization process. The required temperature for preparing single phased CuInSe2 films was remarkably lower than the temperatures used in conventional vacuum and non-vacuum processes. During the hydrothermal reaction, highly reactive selenium ions reacted with copper and indium ions directly to produce CuInSe2 films on the substrates without any high-temperature treatment, leading to the decrease in reaction temperatures appreciably. The increase in the hydrothermal temperatures significantly improved the crystallinity and enlarged the particle sizes of CuInSe2 films. This developed process can be effectively applied for the preparation of CuInSe2 films on flexible substrates at low temperatures.

Abstract: A simple and fast 1D effective medium simulation model for polycrystalline silicon thin film solar cells was defined, by using the device simulator AFORS-HET. The model was calibrated with current–voltage measurements of solar cells under illumination and in t he dark. The experimentally determined variation of the solar cell characteristics with varying absorber doping and absorber thickness can be reproduced by the model. Through inverse modeling, the effective defect density in the absorber layer was determined and it was shown that the open circuit voltage VOC of the cell is limited by defects localized in the bulk of the absorber layer. Using the calibrated simulation model for sensitivity analyses, different optimization strategies for this type of solar cells have been assessed. Firstly, the optimum absorber thickness as a function of absorber doping and defect densities has been determined and secondly, the VOC-increase when using a layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) to form a heterojunction back surface field has been simulated as a function of the absorber defect density.

Abstract: Versatile electrowetting (EW) arrays were fabricated with small to large pixels, on fixed glass and flexible polymer substrates, for smart window applications. EW prototypes on glass substrates were constructed with pixel sizes ranging from 50μm×150μm to 2mm×2mm. The dosing of the array with colored oil was achieved by dip coating the substrate through an oil film suspended on a water bath. The arrays can be driven by either DC or AC voltage. Optical transmission of the prototypes can be modulated from ∼5% to >70% with a relatively low applied voltage of ∼15V. The switching speed of the prototype depends on oil properties and cell size, typically ∼10ms for 300μm×900μm pixel cells. Flexible color EW array prototypes have been fabricated on polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, which can be switched reversibly by applying a relatively low voltage difference between the water and bottom electrode. The EW specifications are maintained even when the prototype is mechanically flexed. These results indicate the promise of EW technology for smart window applications.

Abstract: Identification and functional analysis of novel potential cancer-associated genes is of great importance for developing diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment and management. In the present study, we isolated and identified a novel gene, proline-rich protein 11 (PRR11), implicated in both cell cycle progression and lung cancer. Our results showed that PRR11 was periodically expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, and RNAi-mediated silencing of PRR11 caused significant S phase arrest as well as growth retardation in HeLa cells. Moreover, PRR11 was overexpressed at both mRNA and protein levels in lung cancer tissues as compared with normal lung tissues. Large scale in silico analysis of clinical microarray datasets also indicated that high expression of PRR11 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. RNAi-mediated silencing of PRR11 caused S phase arrest, suppressed cellular proliferation, colony formation ability in lung cancer cells and inhibited tumorigenic potential in nude mice. Knockdown of PRR11 also inhibited cell migration and invasion ability in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that PRR11 knockdown caused the dysregulation of multiple critical pathways and various important genes involved in cell cycle, tumorigenesis and metastasis (e.g. CCNA1, RRM1, MAP4K4 and EPB41L3). Taken together, our results strongly demonstrated that this newly identified gene, PRR11, had a critical role in both cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, and might serve as a novel potential target in the diagnosis and/or treatment of human lung cancer.

Abstract: MiR-122 is a liver-speciﬁc miRNA. Recent studies demonstrated that the interferon (IFN) therapy efficacy is poor in the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with lower miR-122 abundance in the livers. The hepatocarcinoma patients also have low miR-122 levels in their livers. We previously found that the IFN expression was reduced when miR-122 was knocked down in human oligodendrocytes. The mechanism is unclear. In this study, the miR-122-abundant cell Huh7 was used to explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-122 on type I IFN expression. We found that miR-122 significantly increased the type I IFN expression in Huh7 cells, while knocking down miR-122 decreased the type I IFN expression. By screening potential miR-122 targets among the negative regulators in IFN signaling pathways, we found that there were putative miR-122 targets in the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) mRNA. Over-expressing miR-122 decreased the SOCS1 expression by 50.55% in Huh7 cells, while knocking down miR-122 increased SOCS1 expression by 62.56%. Using a green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fused SOCS1-expressing plasmid, the SOCS1-EGFP fluorescence intensity and protein were lower in miR-122 mimic-treated cells than those in mock-miRNA-treated cells, while miR-122 knockdown significantly increased the SOCS1-EGFP fluorescence intensity and protein expression. Mutations in the nt359–nt375 region abandoned the impact of miR-122 on SOCS1-EGFP expression. Taken together, SOCS1 is a target of miR-122. MiR-122 can regulate the type I IFN expression through modulating the SOCS1 expression.

Abstract: In this paper we describe a low substrate temperature CdTe fabrication process by vacuum evaporation (VE) where the recrystallization step avoids the use of CdCl2, which is a carcinogenic material. In our process CdS and CdTe are deposited at pressures of 10−6mbar in the same chamber by thermal evaporation and with substrate temperature of 150°C and 340°C, respectively. The CdTe/CdS/TCO stacks are then put in a quartz chamber and, after having previously pumped the chamber down to 10−5mbar, a controlled mixture of argon and chlorine containing gas is fluxed with a substrate temperature in a range between 400°C and 450°C. The morphological properties of the single layers are studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), cathodo-luminescence (CL) and the electrical properties of the finished devices are presented by means of current–voltage (I–V) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements.

Abstract: Switchable mirrors based on magnesium–yttrium alloy thin films were prepared using a direct-current magnetron sputtering method. The optical switching durability between reflective and transparent states using a gasochromic method has been investigated. Pd-capped Mg1−zYz (0.14<z<0.81) films showed excellent switchable mirror properties. The switching durability increased with Y composition, z, and reached over 10,000 cycles at z>0.5. The mirrors with the Y composition in the wide range of 0.27–0.70 have visible transmittance values of about 35% in the transparent state. The difference in visible transmittance between the reflective and transparent states decreased with z, especially over 0.7. In the transparent state, all prepared switchable mirrors had relatively flat optical transmittance spectra in the visible range and showed nearly neutral color appearance. Thus, the optimal Y composition is in the range of 0.5–0.7 for switchable mirrors with high switching durability and large dynamic range between the reflective and transparent states.

Abstract: Solar selective coatings draw much attention due to its critical role in solar receiver employed in solar heat power generation. Al/Ti0.5Al0.5N/Ti0.25Al0.75N/AlN solar selective coating exhibits a high absorptance of 0.926–0.945 in solar spectrum range and low emittance of 0.04–0.06 (82°C) in infrared spectrum range. The microstructure of the solar selective coatings by using Al as metal reflector layer had been analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), auger electron spectroscopy (AES), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM). After long time annealed in air, the coating is observed to lost effectiveness in solar spectrum adsorption. More Ti–N bonds rather than Ti–N–O bonds are observed in Ti0.5Al0.5N layer. The experimental results also indicate that the crystallization of the adsorption layers is not complete. It is believed that oxygen diffused into the Ti–Al–N layer to form Ti–Al–O–N structure, and the destruction of the four-layer structure, lead to the degradation of the coatings after long time (>192h) annealed in air at high temperature (500°C). Compared with the thermal stability in air, the coatings are much more stable in vacuum under high temperature, which makes it is more appropriate to be used in vacuum.
