Abstract: Bismuth vanadate (BVO) as one of the promising photoanodes suffers from low charge transport mobility and conductivity. Here, dip coating of successive layers of bismuth vanadate (BVO) precursor were utilized to prepared BVO photoanode. Ag-doped BVO electrodes were also prepared by adding a trace amount of Ag+ in the bismuth vanadate precursor and codepositing Ag with the BVO film. In the Ag-doped BVO, Ag+ ions substitutionally replaced Bi3+ ions and increased the electron concentration in BVO. The photocurrent density and photoconductivity of Ag-doped BVO were monitored by changing the loading percentage of Ag (1–5%). At optimum Ag-doping percentage (2% Ag-doped BVO), the photocurrent density is found to be 5.5-fold greater than that of pure BVO. Deterministic investigation indicated that the enhanced PEC performance of the 2% Ag-BVO was attributed to significantly increased donor concentration (30-fold), greater visible light absorption, decreased recombination process of charge carriers (9-fold), thinner space charge layer (6-fold) and reduced flat band potential (16%). The water splitting experiment showed that the total generated H2 after 2 h of irradiation for 2% Ag-BVO was estimated as 5.2 μmol cm-2 and the equivalent value for O2 was 2.70 μmol cm-2.

Abstract: Osteopontin (OPN) is an osteoblast-derived secretory protein that plays a role in bone remodeling, osteoblast responsiveness, and inflammation. We recently found that osteoblast differentiation is type-specific, with conditions of JNK inactivation inducing osteoblasts that preferentially express OPN (OPN-type). Since OPN-type osteoblasts highly express osteogenesis-inhibiting proteins and Rankl, an important inducer of osteoclastogenesis, an increased appearance of OPN-type osteoblasts may be associated with inefficient and poor-quality bone regeneration. However, whether specific osteogenic inducers can modulate OPN-type osteoblast differentiation is completely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that bone morphogenic protein 9 (BMP9) prevents induction of OPN-type osteoblast differentiation under conditions of JNK inhibition. Although JNK inactivation suppressed both BMP2- and BMP9-induced matrix mineralization and osteocalcin expression, the expression of Rankl and specific cytokines such as Gpha2, Esm1, and Sfrp1 under similar conditions was increased in all cells except those treated with BMP9. Increased expression of Id4, a critical transcriptional regulator of OPN-type osteoblast differentiation, was similarly prevented only in BMP9-treated cells. We also found that BMP9 specifically induces the expression of Hey1, a bHLH transcriptional repressor, and that Id4 inhibits the suppressive effects of Hey1 on Opn promoter activity by forming Id4-Hey1 complexes in osteoblasts. Using site-direct mutagenesis, ChIP, and immunoprecipitation, we elucidated that BMP9-induced overexpression of Hey1 can overcome the effects of Id4 and suppress OPN expression. We further found that p38 activation and JNK inactivation are involved in BMP9-induced Hey1 expression. Collectively, these data suggest that BMP9 is a unique osteogenic inducer that regulates OPN-type osteoblast differentiation.

Abstract: Clay minerals are excellent supporting materials to synthesize shape-stabilized phase change materials (ssPCMs) because of outstanding pore structure, excellent thermal stability, perfect organic compatibility and eco-friendly features. However, previous clay-based ssPCMs show very low thermal energy storage capacity due to little loading of working PCMs (<65 wt%). In this work, stearic acid (SA) encapsulated by two-dimensional montmorillonite nanosheets (MtNS) has been designed in order to form core-shell structural MtNS/SA composite PCMs with ultra-high core mass fraction and dramatic latent heat capacity. This study mainly investigates the effect of MtNS shell thickness on thermal energy storage performances, including latent heat, thermal transfer ability, shape stability and cycling performances. Self-assembly mechanism of MtNS/SA was attributed to that the positively charged MtNS strongly attached on the surface of negatively charged SA latex particles and formed a core-shell structure mainly through electrostatic interaction. The MtNS/SA composite showed very large latent heat capacity (184.88 J/g) due to encapsulation of massive SA (>85 wt%). Besides, the composite PCMs also displayed improved thermal transfer ability due to the combination of MtNS, which leads to outstanding thermal charging/discharging rate and excellent photo-thermal conversion efficiency. It was also found that the thinner the MtNS, the better the thermal conductivity and latent heat storage capacity. In addition, the MtNS/SA composites show thermal and structural stability, no leakage occurred even under the encapsulation of the thinnest MtNS shell. Also, the cycling performances of this composite PCMs are very outstanding owing to the effective protection of MtNS shell. Hence, this non-leaking and green MtNS/SA composite PCMs with high-performance heat storage properties can be applied in sustainable energy field.

Abstract: Thin films of yttrium oxy-hydride have interesting, reversible photochromic properties, the origin of which is poorly understood. To investigate the role of point defect mobility, we probed the effect of lattice contraction as induced by the addition of zirconium. Interestingly, we find no loss of photochromic contrast for Y1-zZrzOxHy films with a small Zr cationic fractions (z < 0.15). At larger fractions the photochromic contrast is reduced. Zirconium is found to slow down the bleaching process, which suggests that the mobility of point defects may play a role in the thermal bleaching process. However, we cannot rule out substitution of zirconium in the YOxHy lattice which may also affect the photochromic properties.

Abstract: Müller cells-derived proinflammatory cytokines exert important roles in the development of DR, while the molecular mechanisms of its release were not fully elucidated. Present study aims to investigate the mechanism underlying the regulation of c-myc on the release of Müller Cells-derived proinflammatory cytokines. Streptozotocin was utilized to induce diabetes mellitus (DM) rat and glucose was used to stimulate Müller cells. The interaction between c-myc, lncRNA MIAT and TXNIP was determined by the luciferase reporter, CHIP, RNA pull-down, RIP and ubiquitylation assays. Increased c-myc protein level and concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 were found in DM rats and high glucose stimulated Müller cells. After glucose stimulation, c-myc promoted the releases of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6. The up-regulation of MIAT under glucose treatment was mediated by c-myc binding to its promoter. MIAT interacted with TXNIP and increased TXNIP protein level by inhibiting its ubiquitination degradation. C-myc regulated TXNIP expression through MIAT in glucose induced Müller cells. Under glucose treatment, c-myc facilitated the release of Müller cells-derived IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 by regulating MIAT/TXNIP pathway. The in vivo study further indicated that c-myc knockdown attenuated DR progression in vivo. Our results suggested a mechanism by which c-myc facilitates the release of Müller Cells-derived proinflammatory cytokines by regulating MIAT/TXNIP pathway.

Abstract: The effect of ‘Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation’ (LeTID) of the carrier lifetime is well known from multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers and solar cells. In this contribution, we perform a series of carrier lifetime measurements to examine, whether the same effect may also be observable in boron-doped Czochralski-grown silicon (Cz-Si). The Cz-Si samples of our study are illuminated (i) at room temperature, (ii) under standard regeneration conditions eliminating the boron-oxygen (BO) related defect (i.e. at 185 °C) and (iii) at a temperature of 80 °C, typical for the examination of the LeTID effect in mc-Si. We observe the typical decay of the carrier lifetime due to the activation of the BO-related defect. Beyond the BO degradation, applying standard solar cell processes, there is no indication for the activation of a second defect. On samples, whose surfaces are passivated by fired hydrogen-rich silicon nitride layers, an additional bulk lifetime degradation effect on a long timescale is observed in the Cz-Si material. However, defect generation rate and injection dependence of the lifetime suggest another defect type than the mc-Si-specific LeTID defect. We conclude that by applying processing steps that trigger LeTID in mc-Si, the same defect does not occur in the Cz-Si samples examined in this study. On a long timescale, however, a hitherto unknown type of defect is activated, which is different from the mc-Si-specific LeTID defect. A careful differentiation between the various kinds of recombination centres which may form during illumination at elevated temperatures is hence of utmost importance.

Abstract: Concentrating solar power (CSP) is one of the most promising environmentally-friendly sources of energy for meeting global energy demands. One line of research intended to improve this kind of solar plants involves increasing the efficiency of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) used, one option being the use of nanofluids. Consequently, this study involves a methodology based on liquid phase exfoliation to prepare stable nanofluids based on 2D MoSe2. A surfactant was used to modify the ratio of the components of the fluid's surface tension in order to obtain a stable nanofluid. Five nanofluids were prepared based on MoSe2 nanosheets, Dowtherm A heat transfer fluid and the Triton X-100 surfactant. The stability of the nanofluids was analysed for a month. Lastly, their thermal properties were characterized. The best nanofluid presented improvements of 7% in isobaric specific heat, 4% in diffusivity and 11% in thermal conductivity. Therefore, these nanofluids would appear to provide a good starting point for creating an alternative to the conventional HTFs used in thermosolar plants. The study highlights the importance of optimizing the parameters of the ratio of the surface tension components, the kind of surfactant added and the methodology used to prepare the nanofluid.

Abstract: In this paper, SnO2 prepared by sol-gel method was spin-coated on textured n-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers to replace phosphorus doped n-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in novel Si heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. Good coverage of the sol-gel SnO2 layer on pyramidal textured silicon substrate was achieved. It was demonstrated that a low-work-function metal electrode is necessary for the dopant-free electron transport layer. The SnO2/Mg combination layer was determined to have a low-work-function feature and exhibit a synergistic effect in promoting the selective transport of carriers. A combination passivation layer containing intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(i)) and SiOx which was formed from UV-O3 photo oxidation of the a-Si:H(i) surface for a short time was used to passivate the interface between the SnO2 and the c-Si. The new type a-Si:H/SiOx/SnO2/Mg contact is effective to achieve not only a low contact resistivity but also good passivation properties. Finally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.6% and an open circuit voltage of 695 mV was achieved on a novel SHJ solar cell with an a-Si:H(i)/SiOx combination passivation layer and a SnO2/Mg combination electron selective transport layer.

Abstract: Viologen (V) based molecules are classic and prestigious electrochromic (EC) materials which have dramatic optical contrast and tunable coloring states in solution-type electrochromic devices (ECDs). However, the stability of viologen based ECDs was significantly reduced by the dimer formation, and the resultant aggregation of viologens, which may occur once viologen dication (V2+) was reduced to viologen radical cation (V+•). To diminish this phenomenon, two novel symmetric benzyl-based viologens including 1,1′-bis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl)-4,4′-bipyridine-1,1′-diium (DTFMBzV) and 1,1′-bis(4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl)-4,4′-bipyridine-1,1′-diium (TFMBzV) with various numbers of trifluoromethyl (CF3) substituents were synthesized and studied in this work. Substituent of CF3 in benzyl-based viologens not only enhance its optical property by increasing the π‒conjugation of bipyridine, but also avoid the aggregation by repulsing the viologen with fluorine atoms. The electrochromic performance of ECDs consisted of benzyl viologen (BzV/Fc ECD) and benzyl-based viologens with various numbers of CF3 substituents (DTFMBzV/Fc ECD and TFMBzV/Fc ECD) incorporated with ferrocene (Fc) were studied. According to the result of UV–vis absorbance spectra, the absorbances of benzyl viologen-based ECDs were strengthened at 399 and 605 nm by increasing the number of CF3 substituents. The DTFMBzV/Fc ECD gives a high transmittance change (ΔT) of 63.5% at 605 nm initially with a short response time (<3 s) by biasing the cell potential from 0 to 1.1 V. As for the stability, the DTFMBzV/Fc ECD exhibits an extremely high retention (97% of its initial ΔT) after switching for 10,000 cycles, which implied the dimerization of viologen was diminished by introducing the CF3 substituents with stronger electrostatic repulsion. As the result, DTFMBzV/Fc ECD exhibited the best electrochromic performance in terms of optical contrast and long-term stability. This study provides a simple yet effective strategy to tailing the electrochromic properties of viologen molecules for further application in electrochromism.

Abstract: Here high-efficiency (above 21%) large-area silicon heterojunction solar cells with atomic layer deposited ZnO:Al as front- or back-side transparent conducting oxide are demonstrated. Photoconductance decay measurements indicate that the excellent chemical passivation provided by the a-Si:H(i,p) and a-Si:H(i,n) stacks is preserved upon deposition of ZnO:Al, and that field-effect passivation losses for the a-Si:H(i,p)/ZnO:Al contact can be mitigated by lowering the Al doping level. Use of low Al-doping is enabled by the rear-emitter configuration which, in addition to facilitating the a-Si:H(i,p)/ZnO:Al contact engineering, enables a higher photocurrent due to the decrease in free-carrier absorption in ZnO:Al. The results encourage the use of In-free transparent conducting oxides in silicon heterojunction solar cells, as the replacement of In2O3:Sn without efficiency loss is demonstrated.

Abstract: The ZnO:B (BZO) films with different boron doping levels have been prepared by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) technique. The electrical and optical properties of the BZO films have been systematically investigated through a post annealing treatment in hydrogen atmosphere, as well as in vacuum for comparison. It is found that conductivity of BZO films, especially with a low boron doping level, can be enhanced significantly after annealing in hydrogen, and moreover, the total transmittance (TT) and haze factor of the H2-annealed BZO films were still almost unchanged simultaneously, which were attributed to phenomena of an increase in carrier mobility with an almost constant of free carrier concentration. The conversion efficiency of a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cell incorporating H2-annealed lowly doped BZO film as front electrode was confirmed to be improved remarkably by 1.10% due to the enhancement of TT and haze factor, as compared to that using an as-grown heavily doped BZO film as front electrode. The results indicate that H2-annealing is a quite attractive and alternative technique to optimize properties of BZO film as TCO for further enhancing conversion efficiency of a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells.

Abstract: Durability of photovoltaic (PV) module under outdoor exposure is predominantly controlled by the ambient humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation as well as the mechanical and thermal stresses. Outdoor exposure with multiple cycles of water absorption and desorption degrades the PV module materials as well as their interfaces. This water diffusion behavior, when characterized through reliable and realistic methods, can be used to accurately predict the water concentration within the PV module and thereby help to predict the water-induced degradation in PV module. An in-situ gravimetric method was used in this study to characterize the effects of temperature on the water diffusion behavior of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). Both water absorption and desorption in the EVA showed a simple Fickian behavior. The water diffusion and solubility coefficients determined from in-situ gravimetric experiments in the test range of 24°–50 °C reasonably fitted the Arrhenius rate equations with an activation energy of 30.64 kJ/mol and heat of solution −16.86 kJ/mol, respectively. Finally, the data from the in-situ gravimetric technique was used to simulate and compare the water diffusion within a glass-glass PV module laminate where exposed to accelerated and Delhi outdoor environments. Water penetration depth is limited to about 50 mm for the ten cycles of the humidity freeze test, while it extends to about 110 mm for both 1000 h of damp heat test and one-year outdoor environment.

Abstract: In this paper we present a method for performing temperature- and injection dependent lifetime spectroscopy (TIDLS) with high spatial resolution based on steady state photoluminescence (PL) images taken at a range of excitation intensities and temperatures. The PL lifetime images are calibrated based on temperature dependent photoconductance measurements, thus requiring a minimum of assumptions regarding the temperature dependency of the luminescence signal and detection system. PL image acquisition at varying conditions and subsequent data analysis is automated, allowing for investigations of different samples without the need for excessive operator time. We demonstrate the method by presenting lifetime data and TIDLS analysis from commercial HPMC-Si samples, highlighting the local differences in the recombination properties for high lifetime in-grain areas and lower lifetime areas dominated by dislocation clusters. These regions have been investigated for two etched and passivated neighboring wafers, one in the as-cut state and one where the bulk lifetime had been improved through key solar cell process steps. For the as-cut wafer we find two dominant defects in the low lifetime area, one of which is identified as FeB pairs, with Et = 0.90 ± 0.01 (above the valence band) and k = 0.4 ± 0.1. In the in-grain region of this wafer we also observe two dominating defects, one with an energy level of either 0.28 ± 0.01 eV or 0.74 ± 0.01 eV above the valence band and a k value of 25 ± 1. The other defect is shallow, within ~0.27 eV of the band edge, and could not be further identified with the chosen temperature range. For the wafer that had passed through solar cell processing, we find a clear, overall improvement in the lifetime and a change in the type of dominating defects: We observe that a single, deep defect with 0.35 eV < Et < 0.7 eV and a capture cross section ratio k = 10 ± 1 can fully describe the observed lifetime data in the in-grain area after solar cell processing, whereas two defects are needed to describe the behavior of the lower lifetime regions. One of these defects is also a deep defect with 0.34 eV < Et < 0.69 eV but with a higher k of 25 ± 2, and is thus similar to one of the defects observed in the in-grain region of the as-cut wafer. The other is a shallow defect with Et within 0.21 eV of the band edge. Finally, we show how the method can be used to show interesting new properties of the lifetime maps, including maps of the temperature coefficient of the lifetime, maps of the injection dependence of the lifetime and maps at a constant injection level.

Abstract: The concept of view factor has various applications in engineering problems, ranging from heat management to bifacial photovoltaics. Analytical solutions for view factor calculations are difficult to obtain and normally numerical methods are used. For complex geometries, when several surfaces are arbitrarily arranged in a three-dimensional environment, conventional numerical approaches such as Monte Carlo method will take a lot of simulation time. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a simple and yet accurate view factor estimation method based on ray-casting. In our method, the view factor is determined by sending out rays, evenly distributed in all directions from the target surface, and consequently counting the number of rays intercepted by each of the other surfaces present in the environment under study. Then, a simple algebraic procedure enables the estimation of a large number of view factors simultaneously. The results have been compared with exact and numerical solutions, proving that we have devised a fast and accurate view factor estimation method. This can be used to determine the view factors in environments generated via Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR). The method has the potential to be applied in several scientific researches and engineering studies including heat transfer and solar energy.

Abstract: This work reports a laser firing technique applied to completed silicon heterojunction interdigitated back contact solar cells in order to lower contact resistance. Previously, the implementation of a-Si:H(i) at the electron contact of polycrystalline silicon solar cells on glass substrates led to an increase in series resistance. The cell architecture with the current record efficiency of 14.2% (with illumination through glass) utilizes only an a-Si:H(n+) layer and 2–2.9 mA cm−2 of short circuit current density is lost due to electrical shading under the electron contact [1,2]. The goal of implementing an a-Si:H(i) layer and laser firing at this contact is to achieve low contact resistance at fired spots while preserving a-Si:H(i) passivation in unfired regions. After the laser firing, VOC was retained, while up to 14% absolute increase in FF was obtained with a mere 0.2 mA cm−2 loss in JSC. In the best performing cell, a 72.1% FF was achieved with a 0.7 mA cm−2 loss in JSC. Two laser sources were used to first ablate a part of the silver contact metal, and then to laser fire through the Si(n)/a-Si:H(i/n+)/ITO/Ag contact. The optimal laser fluence was found to be 1.1–0.5 J cm−2 (355 nm, picosecond pulse duration) and 4.4–5.2 J cm−2 (532 nm, nanosecond pulse duration), respectively. The upper limit on specific contact resistance in the laser fired spots was calculated to be 38±20mΩcm2 as a conservative estimate.

Abstract: The development of Broadband Antireflective Coatings (B-ARC) plays a vital role in the accomplishment of more competitive architectural glasses for renewable solar energy applications. In this respect, coatings that provide dual properties like high transmittance and easy-to-clean property, along with weather & UV stabilities could mean an added value to such architectural glasses especially for Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) applications. Herein we report the design and preparation of novel hybrid B-ARC with other functional properties like super-hydrophilic (easy-to-clean/antifogging property), weather and UV stability developed by using a facile sol-gel process. Film-thickness and morphology were optimized by varying the synthesis parameters, coating thickness and curing temperatures; to achieve dual characteristics for the coating. The developed broadband anti-reflective coating shows an average solar transmittance of 98.1% in the visible region (400–800 nm) and 96.6% in the active solar region (300–1500 nm). It is noteworthy that B-ARC generated by this method shows super-hydrophilic property with high weather and UV stabilities (withstand 100 h in high accelerated weather test).

Abstract: Salt hydrate based composite materials are promising to be used for long-term thermochemical heat storage. MgSO4-Zeolite 13x composite materials were prepared in the present work using the solution impregnation method to reveal detailed characteristics of salt hydrates-zeolite composite materials. The porous structure of the composite materials with different MgSO4 contents was characterized, and the adsorption ability and hydration state of MgSO4 of the composite materials under different relative humidities (RH) were investigated. The results show, although the porous surface area and the pore volume were reduced after the penetration of the MgSO4 salt, the water adsorption ability can still be increased. The water adsorption ability also depended highly on the RH. Besides, not all the MgSO4 formed the hydrate state of MgSO4·6H2O and no MgSO4·7H2O were detected even for the equilibrium adsorption at high RH of 80%. The composite with 8 wt% MgSO4 showed the best performance, and could be a promising thermochemical material for long-term heat storage.

Abstract: Renal tubular epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the main pathological change in diabetic renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Mounting evidence indicates that the inhibitor of differentiation 2 (Id2) protein acts as a negative regulatory factor in organ fibrosis and can inhibit or reverse the process of fibrosis. However, its specific regulatory mechanism is not clear. Diabetes mellitus (DM) rat models were established by injecting rats with streptozotocin and sacrificing them after 16 weeks. Rat renal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) were cultured with normal and high glucose. Immunohistochemical analysis, double immunofluorescence staining, co-immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the expression of Id2, Twist, Smad1/5/8, E-cadherin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen Ⅳ. The results showed that bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) upregulated the expression of Id2 against high-glucose-induced EMT and extracellular matrix secretion. Moreover, only the simultaneous knockdown of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 downregulated the expression of Id2, which was not altered by the individual knockdown of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors were essential for Id2 to regulate the role of downstream target genes, and Twist was a bHLH transcription factor. Therefore, the expression of Twist was examined in this study. Twist was found to be highly expressed in the kidney of DM rats and renal tubular epithelial cells cultured with high glucose. The overexpression of Id2 did not alter the expression of Twist, but the interaction between Id2 and Twist was enhanced. In conclusion, the data showed the specific mechanism underlying Id2 negative regulation in diabetic renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

Abstract: It has been clinically documented that maduramicin (Mad), a polyether ionophore antibiotic widely used in the control of coccidiosis in poultry worldwide, can elicit skeletal muscle degeneration, heart failure, and even death in animals and humans, if improperly used. Here, we show that Mad induced apoptosis dose-dependently, which was associated with impaired autophagic flux in skeletal myoblast (C2C12 and L6) cells. This is supported by the findings that Mad treatment resulted in increase of autophagosomes with a concomitant elevation of LC3-II and p62 in the cells. Also, Mad increased co-localization of mCherry and GFP tandem-tagged LC3 puncta in the cells, suggesting a blockage of autophagic flux. Furthermore, addition of chloroquine (CQ) strengthened the basic and Mad-enhanced LC3-II and p62 levels, autophagosome formation and cell apoptosis, whereas pretreatment with rapamycin alleviated the effects in the cells exposed to Mad. Moreover, we noticed that Mad treatment inactivated Akt dose-dependently. Inhibition of Akt with inhibitor X potentiated Mad-induced decrease in phosphorylated Akt, and increases in LC3-II and p62 levels, autophagosome formation and cell apoptosis, whereas ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt rendered resistance to these events. Collectively, these results indicate that Mad inactivation of Akt impairs autophagic flux leading to accumulated autophagosomes-dependent apoptosis in skeletal myoblast cells. Our findings suggest that manipulation of Akt activity to improve autophagic flux is a promising strategy against Mad-induced myotoxicity.

Abstract: We compare the electrical properties of p-type and n-type industrially grown High Performance (HP) multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) and mono-like silicon. The materials are characterised in terms of their bulk lifetimes, their implied open circuit voltages, and the density and recombination velocity of recombination active grain boundaries and dislocation clusters within the materials. Quokka3 is applied to simulate the cell performance potential of the studied materials, and quantify the corresponding efficiency loss due to different recombination mechanisms occurring in the bulk. Our results show that bulk recombination causes a noticeable efficiency loss in high efficiency cast-grown silicon solar cells, varying from 0.1% to 3.1% absolute in the simulated devices, depending on the materials and also the ingot position of the wafers. The performance of p-type HP mc-Si is affected by both recombination at extended crystal defects and in the intra-grain regions. N-type HP mc-Si shows a slight advantage over p-type HP mc-Si in the intra-grain regions. The advantage of p-type mono-like Si over p-type mc-Si mainly comes from optical gains due to alkaline texturing, but the material exhibits large performance variations along the ingot of up to 2.4% absolute. N-type mono-like Si shows the most promising material properties, featuring less performance variation along the ingot than p-type mono-like Si, and the highest efficiency potential among the four studied materials.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of two 30-year-old PV modules is performed by a combination of the equivalent-circuit model and optoelectronic characterization methods. The two modules under analysis were manufactured in 1984 with the nameplate power of 41.0 W, but degraded under two different conditions; one was operated in the field in Northern California for about 30 years, and the other was stored in a warehouse for the same period. The power outputs of the two modules measured in 2016 are as 28.4W for the field-exposed one and 35.9 W for the warehoused one. We further break down this power difference of 7.5 W ± 0.3 W to specific physical mechanisms. Through the encapsulant transmittance measurements and the circuit modeling of module I–V curves, the power degradation due to encapsulant discoloration is found as 59% ± 4% of the total difference. With the bias-dependent electroluminescence imaging and the dark I–V measurement of solar cells (via the additionally-attached probe wires), the series-resistance increase is attributed to 33% ± 1%, with the split of 13% ± 4% due to interconnection resistance and 20% ± 4% due to cell resistance. In addition, the synergistic effect of all the physical mechanisms makes up the remaining 8% ± 4%. This case study presents an example of analyzing multiple degradation mechanisms of the PV modules. With more characterization data being collected for today's modules, the same analysis framework can be broadly applied, yield great insights module power degradation attributed to multiple loss mechanisms.

Abstract: Four novel materials containing isoindigo derivatives were synthesized via Stille coupling reaction. These polymers not only have excellent electrochromic properties (the highest electrochromic efficiency reaches 195 cm2 C−1), but also have low charge transfer resistance (Rct). The range of switching threshold is from −1.7 V to −4.0 V and the current ratio of the device beyond 10−5 for memory device. Moreover, the polymers can also be used as explosive detector. A sharp drop in the fluorescence intensity of the polymer appeared when trinitrotoluene (TNT) or 2, 4, 6-trinitrophenol (TNP) was added.

Abstract: The directional spectral emissivities of four new copper-alloyed spinel coatings for concentrated solar power applications were measured up to 800 °C and compared Pyromark 2500®, deposited in the same conditions on Inconel 625. Reproducible results were found for all coatings at all temperatures, with similar spectral features at working temperatures. The temperature and angular dependences are related to the morphology and composition of the samples. The total hemispherical emissivity increases up to 400 °C for all coatings and then stabilizes, with similar values for most materials, except for the porous Cu0.5Cr1.1Mn1.4O4 coating. This coating offers a reduced total hemispherical emissivity due to increased semitransparency at high angles arising from its porosity. This porosity is linked to an increase in both the solar absorptance and the emissivity in the normal direction due to enhanced light trapping, which means that this coating shows signs of directional selectivity. These results, together with the data dispersion reported for Pyromark, suggest that structural properties are key for the high-temperature emissivity of the coatings and highlight the importance of direct emissivity characterization. Combined with absorptance measurements, these emissivity measurements allow for accurate calculations of the high-temperature efficiencies of the coatings, which reach values up to 0.929.

Abstract: When solar radiation reaches its peak value during the midday, buildings' external walls absorb the highest amount of heats and result in dramatic spikes in cooling load and energy consumption. To flatten the energy peak, promote energy efficiency, and preserve thermal comfort, this study developed a novel foamed thermal insulation cement block with extraordinary heat storage capacity. To prepare the proposed foamed cement block, a paraffin/expanded graphite composite phase change heat storage material with a phase transition temperature of 41.9 °C and an enthalpy value of 207.8 J/g was used to load paraffin into expanded graphite in a water bath at 44 °C. After mixing the paraffin/expanded graphite composite phase change material (PCM) with cement, foams were added, stirred and poured into the mold to make a novel foaming cement thermal insulation block. Due to its porous structure, the foamed cement has lightweight as well as high heat preservation capacity. To investigate the characteristics of the proposed material, this investigated its physical structure, thermal conductivity, and heat energy storage performance when the material mass fractions of PCM are 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30%, and regular (pure) cement blocks. The experimental results show that there is no chemical reaction during material preparation. In addition, composite materials’ PCM mass fraction and their thermal storage capacity increase simultaneously. The comprehensive analysis shows that foamed cement blocks with 30% PCM contents have the best thermal energy storage performance and can maintain the lowest average indoor temperature. Therefore, the proposed foamed cement blocks can be applied to building outer surfaces and sandwiched middle enclosures to develop energy efficiency insulation walls.

Abstract: Phase change latex (PCL) is a novel kind of phase change fluid with advantages both phase change emulsion (PCE) and latex. A series of oil/water PCLs were obtained by dissolving paraffin and ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) in petroleum ether, followed by emulsifying in water. The effects of emulsifier type, emulsifier content, homogenization rate and paraffin content on stability, viscosity and particle size of PCL were systematically investigated. The results showed that paraffin/EPDM PCL was able to be stably stored when the content of emulsifier, a mixture of 1-dodecanesulphonic acid sodium salt (DAS) and sorbitan monooleate (Span-80), was 6 wt% and homogenization rate was 16000 r/min. Afterwords, the PCL with the paraffin mass fractions (paraffin to the sum of paraffin and EPDM) from 0 wt% to 100 wt% were prepared. When the paraffin content is 50 wt%, the PCL has the most excellent stability and suitable particle size and distribution. As the paraffin content increased, the viscosity of PCL generally decreased sharply, and the PCL enthalpy value increased gradually. PCL has great application potential in the field of thermal energy transmission in chemical pipelines and building homes.

Abstract: Background
With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS), thousands of circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been found. Many circRNAs have been verified to play vital roles in carcinogenesis. However, whether circRNAs engage in the development and progression of ovarian cancer remains to be clarified.
Methods
We analyzed circRNA expression profiling in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and normal ovarian tissues (NOT) using NGS and validated six randomly selected circRNAs via quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR), reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing after RNase treatment. CircHIPK3, the most abundant circRNA in our sequencing data, was further knocked down by siRNA. The circHIPK3 function in proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells and normal ovarian epithelial cells was analyzed via cell counting-kit 8 (CCK8), wound healing, transwell and flow cytometry analyses after circHIPK3 was efficiently silenced.
Results
Altogether, we found 7333 circRNAs, of which 4505 (61.43%) were newly identified, 2431 were significantly upregulated and 3120 were remarkably downregulated. Six randomly selected differentially expressed circRNAs were examined in 18 EOC and 18 NOT. Furthermore, the results of RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing after RNase treatment confirmed head-to-tail back-splicing. Silencing of circHIPK3 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells (A2780 and SKOV3) and normal ovarian epithelial cells (IOSE80). Additionally, the circHIPK3-miRNA-mRNA axis was predicted as the possible mechanism using bioinformatic approaches.
Conclusions
We identified the circRNA expression profile in ovarian cancer tissues and further verified the existence and expression of six randomly selected differentially expressed circRNAs. Besides, we also found that circHIPK3 is an important regulator of ovarian cancer progression.

Abstract: The ongoing demand for a further reduction of electrode width for solar cell metallization by flatbed and rotary screen printing is one of the main challenges in recent years. The main focus was on the improvement of silver paste printability which is strongly influenced by its rheological behavior. Furthermore, the impact of slip behavior in contact with smooth surfaces e.g. mesh wires and emulsion plays an important role when printing of small electrode width is desired. Therefore, four types of coatings for screen emulsions are investigated in terms of their wall slip behavior with commercial available silver pastes. For this reason, a novel parameter slip efficiency β is introduced which enables the prediction of potential improvements in fine line screen printing by slip effects at the paste-emulsion interface. Furthermore, contact angles on coated surfaces with respective paste solvents are measured and an exponential correlation between both is discovered. Finally, metallization results of a PERC solar cell batch for the two best coating candidates are presented and a correlation between printed electrode width and slip efficiency during screen printing is given. For the best coating, an average finger resistance of 99 Ω/m at an average finger width of 26.2 μm was demonstrated which shows a significant improvement compared to the reference with a finger resistance of 164 Ω/m for 27.7 μm finger width.

Abstract: Nanocrystals of semiconducting, highly-doped metal oxides present localized surface plasmon resonance properties responsible for intense optical absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral range. These features make them strong candidates for designing “new generation”, spectrally-selective electrochromic smart windows and other optoelectronic devices. In the present study, nanocrystals of tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) are solvothermally-synthesized in benzyl alcohol. Their structure, morphology and composition are assessed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, while their optical plasmonic behavior is evidenced by means of VIS-NIR spectrometry and electron energy loss spectroscopy coupled to scanning transmission electron microscopy. Remarkably, the latter setup allows for the value-added acquisition of high-resolution mappings and quantifications of the nanocrystals individual plasmon responses at both surface and bulk levels. Inks of ITO nanocrysals are then spray-coated onto glass to act as NIR-modulating plasmonic electrochromic layers. ITO dispersions are straightforwardly deposited from low toxic media (isopropanol) according to a room-temperature procedure implying no harsh chemical or thermal post-treatment – only a mild drying step at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements completed on the films immersed in liquid electrolyte show appreciable NIR contrasts (up to 40%) upon electrochemical charge/discharge, together with a >80% VIS transmittance.

Abstract: The superior thermal behavior and light-to-thermal energy conversion performance are crucial for microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) in thermal energy management. In this work, a series of paraffin@graphene/melamine-formaldehyde microPCMs based on graphene Pickering stabilizer were prepared by in-situ polymerization. Graphene was served as a Pickering stabilizer. We have undertaken a comprehensive study of the effects of different graphene concentrations and core/shell ratio on the microPCMs. The leakage rate test showed that the leakage rate of the microPCMs with 0.2 wt% of graphene is decreased by 93.20% than that of the microPCMs without graphene. Graphene promotes light-to-thermal conversion efficiency of microPCMs, which reaches to 90.7%. Additionally, the optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to characterize the morphology of the Pickering emulsion droplet and microPCMs, respectively. Thermal properties of microPCMs were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal conductivity test. The results indicated that the latent heat of the microPCMs with core/shell ratio of 4/1 is 204.0 J g−1 and thermal conductivity of that is 0.707 W m−1 K−1. Furthermore, because of the leakage prevention performance, thermal conductivity and light-to-thermal conversion performance of microPCMs, it may be forecast that microPCMs possess significant applications in thermal energy storage management.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic analysis of the transport mechanism and surface passivation of tunneling oxide (SiO2)/p-type poly-silicon (poly-Si(p)) junctions applied to p-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells by means of TCAD numerical simulations. We report on the impact of the buried doped region (BDR) in the c-Si wafer on the transport and passivation of SiO2/poly-Si(p) junctions. We show that a BDR is not necessary for carrier selective contacts (CSCs) with a tunnel oxide thinner than 1.2 nm and for surface recombination velocity at SiO2/c-Si interface below 1·103 cm/s. Then, we explore alternative semiconductors to poly-Si for tunnel oxide passivating contacts. We find that 3C–SiC(p) is a promising candidate thanks to its valence band offset with respect to silicon, driving the wafer surface into a condition of strong accumulation. We show that excellent SiO2/3C–SiC(p) junctions are obtained for doping density of the 3C–SiC(p) larger than 5·1019 cm−3 and for SiO2 thinner than <1.2 nm. Finally, with the aim of deriving guidelines for material selection, we present an investigation on the influence of the electron affinity and bandgap of the semiconductor layer forming the passivating contact, demonstrating that conversion efficiency is maximized for built-in voltages between 0.4 and 2.6 eV.

Abstract: Recent guidelines for the third generation of solar absorber coatings have shown an unavoidable necessity for low thermal emittance coatings for concentrated solar power tower technology to decrease the thermal loss at the absorber surface. By tuning the pigment spinel crystal structure, density or roughness of a coating, improved optical properties for the coating can be achieved. In this study, a high solar-radiation absorbing pigment CuMn1.5Fe0.5O4 was calcined with 3 wt % Al, Fe, Ni, Mo and Cr to study the optical property improvement of the absorber coating, which could increase the efficiency of concentrated solar power plants. The modified pigment particles were investigated and compared to the non-modified pigment by XRD, TEM and elemental mapping, which showed that the pigment was successfully doped with Fe, Ni, and Cr. In contrast, no spinel doping was observed when Al and Mo were used. The most likely final position of the migrating Cr atoms was determined by comparing the experimental IR spectrum of the Cr-doped spinel structure with the spectra of various structures calculated based on first principles density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the prepared coatings were thermally aged for 1300 h at 800 °C in air, followed by repetitive optical measurements. Outstanding results were achieved for the aged coating, which was made from a Cr-doped black pigment. Its solar absorptance (>95%) and εT/αS ratio (0.94) after 1300 h of thermal ageing were better than that of a standard paint (εT/αS = 1). We estimated that it may be possible to save up to 300,000 €/year on a fully operating concentrated solar power (CSP) plant by replacing the standard absorber paint with the Cr-doped pigment due to its better absorption efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid perovskites have received tremendous attention due to their exceptional photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties. Among the two widely used perovskite solar cell device architectures of n-i-p and p-i-n, the latter is interesting in terms of its simplicity of fabrication and lower energy input. However this structure mostly uses PEDOT:PSS as a hole transporting layer which can accelerate the perovskite solar cell degradation. Hence the development of stable, inorganic hole extraction layers (HEL), without compromising the simplicity of device fabrication is crucial in this fast-growing photovoltaic field. Here we demonstrate a low temperature (~100 °C) solution - processed and ultrathin (~6 nm) NiO nanoparticle thin films as an efficient HEL for CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. We measure a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% on rigid glass substrates and 8.5% on flexible substrates. A comparison with PEDOT:PSS based MAPbI3 solar cells (PCE ~ 7.9%) shows that NiO based solar cells have higher short circuit current density and improved open circuit voltage (1.03 V). Apart from the photovoltaic performance under 1 Sun, the efficient hole extraction property of NiO is demonstrated for indoor lighting as well with a PCE of 23.0% for NiO based CH3NH3PbI2.9Cl0.1 p-i-n solar cells under compact fluorescent lighting. Compared to the perovskite solar cells fabricated on PEDOT:PSS HEL, better shelf-life stability is observed for perovskite solar cells fabricated on NiO HEL. Detailed microstructural and photophysical investigations imply uniform morphology, lower recombination losses, and improved charge transfer properties for CH3NH3PbI3 grown on NiO HEL.

Abstract: The inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein and senses cellular unfolded/misfolded proteins. Upon activation, IRE1α removes a 26-bp nucleotide from the mRNA encoding X-box binding protein (XBP) 1 to generate a spliced active form of this transcription factor (XBP1s). Though IRE1α is implicated in development of cancer, the role and underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that IRE1α regulates colon cancer cell metastasis through regulating the expression of fibronectin-1 (FN1). We found that knockdown of IRE1α inhibited colon cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Knockdown of IRE1α decreased the formation of XBP1s and attenuated the expression of FN1, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Src and FAK and inactivation the downstream effector GTPases including RhoA, Rac1 and CDC42. Addition of exogenous FN1 reversed Src/FAK phosphorylation and cell migration inhibited by IRE1α knockdown. We found that XBP1s bound FN1 promoter and acted as a transcription factor to initiate FN1 expression. Our results suggest that IRE1α modulates metastatic potential of colon cancer cells through regulating the expression of FN1.

Abstract: A significant role of graphene in the form of nano-sized flakes, employed in a very basic electrochromic device, has been reported in improving its performance. Prepared graphene nanoflakes which are transparent in nature has been used in a solid state electrochromic device as a tool to probe the kinetics of charge transport through the device. It has been observed that it works as a facilitating solid state electrolyte for the device which improves overall speed. Preparation of these nano-flakes from the graphene sheets have been done by chemical oxidation and hydrothermal treatment followed by microscopic and spectroscopic characterization. During the operation of the electrochromic device it has been observed form the electrochemistry that the graphene nanoflakes provide an efficient platform to transport charge between redox supporting reagent anchored with it and improve overall speed and performance of the device thus showing a capacitor-type behavior for quicker redox process. Real time UV–Vis spectroscopy has been used to track the kinetic of optical changes within the device.

Abstract: Metallic nanoparticles can act as efficient photocatalysts thanks to the surface plasmons that they support, which are capable of harvesting light and generating hot carriers. Recently, titanium nitride (TiN) nanostructures have emerged as promising candidates for this application due to their much lower cost, and therefore greater sustainability, than structures made of noble metals, as well as their expected long-term thermal stability. In this work, we demonstrate that, under solar illumination, TiN nanoparticles, in combination with titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures, can significantly increase the photocatalytic production of formate through the simultaneous photoreduction of bicarbonate and oxidation of glycerol. Importantly, we also show that TiN nanoparticles alone can provide an enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiently when compared to TiO2 nanocatalysts. Furthermore, by characterizing the morphology and material properties of the TiN nanoparticles after the reaction, we confirm that they remain stable under reaction conditions for extended periods of solar light exposure (8 hours). The results of this work advance our understanding of TiN nanoparticles as efficient photocatalysts and their use for the production of valuable chemicals.

Abstract: Objective/background
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by a point mutation in the HBB gene. Here we characterized the clinical presentation of SCD in a population from Amazonas State in northern Brazil, in order to evaluate whether the higher Amerindian ancestry observed in this relatively isolated geographic region would influence the clinical presentation of SCD.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study characterizing the clinical presentation of SCD patients registered at HEMOAM, Amazon, Brazil. Data were obtained using a structured questionnaire, and by a review of the medical records.
Results
Of the 236 SCD patients listed in the historical records, 122 were included in this study. The median age was 15 years, with a male to female ratio of 52:70. The population was characterized by a high level of socioeconomic vulnerability, with only 2.1% presenting a family income above five minimum wages. Homozygous HbS (SS) was the most prevalent form of SCD (89.7%), and the diagnosis of SCD was performed in the context of complications in 92.3% of patients. The median frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis in the past 12 months was 2 (0–10). Using a validated clinical severity score based on clinical and laboratory data, no significant difference could be observed when compared to other populations.
Conclusion
Our results represent the first comprehensive characterization of epidemiological, laboratorial, and clinical data of SCD in the region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the higher contribution of Amerindian ancestry previously demonstrated in this region, the main clinical characteristics of SCD seem similar to those reported in other populations.

Abstract: Thermochromic vanadium dioxide (VO2) window coatings hold the promise of reducing the energy consumption of the built environment by passively regulating solar heat gain in response to changing conditions. Composite materials with embedded VO2 particles have shown greatly improved optical performances compared with thin films, however they typically exhibit broadened phase transition hysteresis and gradient widths, which negatively impacts the overall performance. Here, we present a scalable one-step solution based synthesis for a thermochromic smart window coating based on a vanadium dioxide sol-gel containing silica (SiO2 nanoparticles. We compare the performance of our nanoparticle composite with thin film VO2 along with composites formed by mixing VO2 and SiO2 sol-gels and find that both composites achieve an acceptable visible transmittance (∼ 50%) along with a comparable and competitive solar modulation (12.5% and 16.8% respectively), roughly double that of the plain VO2 film (6.7%). However, our SiO2 nanoparticle containing composite also benefits from a narrow transition hysteresis and gradient width (9.4 ∘C and 2.9 ∘C respectively). We predict that this method may subsequently be combined with metal ion doping to control both the optical and phase transition characteristics to achieve composite films with high overall energy saving performances.

Abstract: With the possible depletion of oil resources and environmental considerations, vegetable oils are considered with great interest in high-temperature applications especially for solar plants. Many parameters affect vegetable oil stability, namely temperature, oxygen, moisture, duration of exposure to heat, etc. Conventional markers such as peroxide or free fatty acids do not always reliably indicate oil quality at high temperature. Evaluating the content of other degradation products such as polymers provides a better estimate. Reducing exposure to oxygen limits oil degradation. Vegetable oils have proven to be a favourable alternative to mineral oils in some applications, and several vegetable oils are commercially available. Their current use in solar cookers gives a good overview of their potential. Several reasons advocate for the use of vegetable oils in concentrating solar power plants: they are renewable resources, environmentally friendly, non-hazardous, highly available and less flammable products. Moreover, their thermophysical properties are similar, if not better, than those of thermal oils commonly used in solar plants. Despite these advantages, vegetable oils face some challenges, as for example their low oxidation stability. If the major challenge of using vegetable oils at high temperatures is their oxidation stability, the numerous environmental, economic and technological advantages make them innovative fluids for high temperature applications, particularly for solar applications.

Abstract: Metallo-supramolecular polymers (Fe-MEPEs) based on Fe2+ ions and bis(terpyridine) ligands exhibit outstanding optical and electrochromic properties. The intensive coloration of Fe-MEPEs is caused by the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition in the visible region. Thin films with high optical quality can be produced on transparent conducting glass or plastic substrates by common wet-coating techniques, e.g. dip-coating or roll-to-roll (R2R) processes. By applying a low voltage, the Fe-MEPE films can be reversibly switched between the reduced (dark) state (Fe2+) and the oxidized (bright) state (Fe3+). A further color change is visible at negative voltages resulting from a strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Visible light transmittance changes (Δτv) > 60%, fast response times, and cycle stabilities over 10,000 switching cycles are demonstrated, which makes these electrochromic Fe-MEPEs very attractive to be used in electrochromic devices for a number of applications, e.g. in wearables, labels, architectural glazing, appliances, vehicles, and aircraft.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of annealing at elevated temperatures on the light-induced degradation (LID) of passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) processed on boron-doped Czochralski-grown silicon substrates. The boron-oxygen (BO) defect has been stabilised prior to annealing and subsequent LID treatment. Excessive LID of up to 19.1 %rel. is observed upon illumination after extended dark annealing at 150 °C for 552 h, which is well above the BO defect-related LID of 5.6 %rel. measured upon illumination after cell processing if BO is not stabilised. Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID), iron-boron pairs and surface recombination are excluded as root causes for the observed increased LID, which shows a similar behaviour as the BO defect but which cannot be explained by the well-established three-state model of the BO defect with the assumption of an empty regenerated state prior to BO stabilisation. Two speculative hypothesis for an explanation are (i) that further BO defect precursors are formed, which could be described via a reservoir or (ii) that a high percentage of the in-principle available BO defects are already in the stabilised state even without dedicated BO defect stabilisation. This increased LID does not occur when at least a small level of excess carrier concentration is induced during extended annealing and, hence, is expected not to occur during field operation. However, the observed behaviour is highly relevant for accelerated aging testing such as, e.g., damp heat testing during IEC and UL certification.

Abstract: The main event in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis is the appearance of myofibroblasts. Recent evidence supports pericytes as a major source of myofibroblasts. TGFβ/Smad2/3 and PDGF/Erk signaling pathways are important for regulating pericyte activation. Previous studies have demonstrated that PDGFβR and TGFβR are modified by core fucosylation (CF) catalyzed by α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8). The aim of this study was to compare the effect of inhibiting CF versus the PDGFβR and TGFβR signaling pathways on pericyte activation and lung fibrosis. FUT8shRNA was used to knock down FUT8-mediated CF both in vivo and in isolated lung pericytes. The small molecule receptor antagonists, ST1571 (imatinib) and LY2109761, were used to block the PDGFβ/pErk and TGFβ/pSmad2/3 signaling pathways, respectively. Pericyte detachment and myofibroblastic transformation were assessed by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings demonstrate that FUT8shRNA significantly blocked pericyte activation and the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, achieving intervention effects superior to the small molecule inhibitors. The PDGFβ and TGFβ pathways were simultaneously affected by the CF blockade. FUT8 expression was upregulated with the transformation of pericytes into myofibroblasts, and silencing FUT8 expression inhibited this transformation. In addition, there is a causal relationship between CF modification catalyzed by FUT8 and pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings suggest that FUT8 may be a novel therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Application of clay mineral based phase change materials (PCMs) on solar energy storage was limited by poor latent heat storage and thermal conductivity. In this study, two-dimensional montmorillonite/stearic acid/Ag nanoparticles (2D-Mt/SA/AgNPs) composites were prepared to enhance the latent heat capacity and thermal transfer ability. It was found that the composites possessed ultra-high latent heat storage (>187 J/g) and contained more than 90 wt% of SA. Besides, 2D-Mt/SA/AgNPs showed 229.3% increase in thermal conductivity after incorporation of AgNPs into the core of composite PCMs, compared with pure SA. In addition, 2D-Mt/SA/AgNPs exhibited remarkable thermal charging/discharging rate and outstanding light-thermal conversion ability due to the excellent heat transfer ability. Because of the excellent thermal stability and structure reliability, 2D-Mt/SA/AgNPs showed superior cycling performances in the heating/cooling tests. As a consequence, 2D-Mt/SA/AgNPs were promising sustainable energy storage materials owing to large latent heat, high thermal conductivity, outstanding thermal stability and excellent cycling performance.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxides (VO2) thermochromic materials could exhibit reversible change in optical transmittance in response to external temperature. However, traditional VO2-based smart window is limited to an insufficient solar modulation ability as well as excessive transition temperature. Herein, we designed an all-solid form of YOxHy/VO2 multilayer film structure on quartz glass substrate, which can separately regulate visible and NIR light transmittance responding to environmental light and temperature, respectively. The hybrid film exhibits transparency under normal condition of room temperature and weak illumination, and solar energy transmittance can be dynamically regulated from 43% to 28%, 16% and finally 14% by controlling the conditions of temperature and illumination. Also, the optical and electrical transition temperature of m-VO2 shows an obvious decline. This hybrid film features high solar modulation ability and great conditional responsiveness with zero-energy consumption and low transition temperature. Our current results would supply new opportunities for smart-window applications, and also provide a new strategy for solar transmittance modulation.

Abstract: Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanofluids suffer from low dispersion and short shelf life which hinder their large-scale application in solar energy system. To respond this, in this study a novel method of MWCNTs nanofluids preparation has been designed. It is a one-pot method by stirred media mill technique achieving the objective of low cost and scalable for nanofluids production, in which nearly 1 L MWCNTs nanofluids of 3 wt% could be gotten in a laboratory-scale production process. Apart from with concentration adjustability and long-lasting stability, obtained MWCNTs nanofluids also displayed superior optical properties. It showed that the average extinction coefficient of 0.01 wt% milling-treated MWCNTs nanofluid was 7.49 cm-1, which was obviously higher than that of 0.01 wt% acid-treated sample with 6.55 cm-1. Especially, the spectral analysis revealed that milling-treated MWCNTs nanofluids had better energy absorption capacity in visible and near-infrared regions. Moreover, the evaluation of solar energy absorption fraction showed that 0.01 wt% MWCNTs nanofluid could absorb nearly 100% incident energy, when fluid thickness was more than 0.5 cm. It means that MWCNTs nanofluids could be tailored easily for volumetric solar receiver to achieve optimal design. Furthermore, the solar-thermal conversion tests were conducted under natural solar radiation and a high conversion efficiency (95%) was obtained at first 10 min in 0.02 wt% MWCNTs nanofluids. It is worth to note that the performance degradation of high concentration MWCNTs nanofluids did not happen during conversion tests. Such results revealed that MWCNTs nanofluids were prepared successfully in large-scale and the high performance of them showed their application potential in solar energy system.

Abstract: The present work aims encapsulating photovoltaic cells in glass reinforced epoxy composite by vacuum resin infusion, incorporating additives directed to enhance the performance stability of the manufactured photovoltaic modules under ultraviolet (UV) exposure. UV absorber (UVA) and hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) additives were incorporated in the resin system in different content. Photovoltaic performance and stability under UV radiation exposure were studied through external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, chromatic coordinates and short-circuit current values. Decrease in current values and increase in yellowness were observed in the presence of UVA and HALS. However, an enhanced performance stability was observed when additives are incorporated, improving the stability when increasing the additive amount. The most stable module, with cells embedded in 2% additive containing composite, showed a 2.7% short-circuit current loss after UV aging exposure.

Abstract: Nanofluids offer the potential to address the low thermal conductivities found in conventional heat transfer fluids, through their unique electrical, optical and thermal properties, but their implementation remains restricted due to absorption and stability limitations. Here, we characterize and exploit the distinctive plasmonic properties exhibited by polyvinyl-alcohol stabilized silver nanostructures by tuning their absorption and thermal properties through controlling the nanoparticle size, morphology and particle-size distribution configuration at the synthesis stage. The photo-thermal efficiency of different water-based silver nanofluids under a standard AM1.5G weighted solar spectrum were explored, the influence of each of these components on the resulting fluids performance within a direct absorption solar thermal collection system being considered. Nanofluids, containing an extensive ensemble of particle size-distributions (5 nm–110 nm in diameter) in addition to anisotropic particle morphologies (e.g. prisms, hexagons and other non-spherical geometries), exhibited a significant enhancement in the absorption and photo-thermal energy transfer. Enhancements of 5%–32% in the photo-thermal conversion efficiency were achieved, the enhancement being dependent upon the presence of multiple particle size-distributions and the particle concentration. The enhancement is influenced by the interactions occurring between the individual particle size-distributions but also by the collective behaviour of the particles ensemble. The critical particle diameter, above which the photo-thermal characteristics of the nanofluid become dominated by the larger sized particles present, was identified as 150 nm. The increased performance of these nanofluids, which adopt a more complex particle-size configuration, suggests that they can represent suitable candidates for solar-thermal applications.

Abstract: Smart windows have attracted much attention owing to their capability of saving energy by modulating sunlight after exerting external stimulus of voltage, light or heat. However, most of these smart windows can only insulate heat by blocking sunlight at high temperature. Herein, we fabricate the Cu7S4/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) composite film with fast optical/thermal response for smart switching to regulate indoor temperature under both low and high temperature. This smart window can save energy smartly and efficiently via integrating the wide absorption of sunlight and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of Cu7S4 nanoparticles and thermo-responsive effect of PNIPAm. This smart window is transparent (Tlum = 79%, at thickness of 75 μm) and only blocks part of infrared and UV light (TIR = 68.7%, Tsol = 71.9%) at comfortable temperature (20 °C) and low light intensity. However, when temperature is over 32 °C, the smart window can quickly become opaque within 3 min to block more light (Tlum = 41.1%, TIR = 43.0%, Tsol = 40.4%) due to its good photothermal-responsive property. As long as the sunlight is strong enough, the smart window can absorb sunlight and convert it into heat to increase indoor temperature even in cold weather. This smart window can regulate solar radiation dynamically and adapt to surrounding temperature automatically to offer a new strategy to cut down energy consumption of buildings and vehicles smartly.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films deposited using direct current magnetron sputtering and sulfurized at different argon atmosphere pressures of 950, 460 and 50 mbar are studied focusing on the control of disorder degree and secondary phases. The films are in detail characterized employing X-ray diffraction, scanning electron and conductive atomic force microscopies, energy dispersive X-ray, μ-Raman spectroscopies and mappings. Such a comprehensive approach shows how the pressure variation influences morphology, structural and electrical properties of the films in submicron scale. The films sulfurized at the lowest applied pressure of 50 mbar are found to be single-phase CZTS with low disordering degree. Nevertheless, in those sulfurized at 950 and 460 mbar, Cu2-xS and ZnS secondary phases with concomitant spatial inhomogeneities are detected. At the same time, sulfurization at higher pressures enlarges the grains, which however demonstrate wide size distribution. Formation of CZTS crystal structure and secondary phases as well as acceleration of grain growth depending on pressure are interpreted and discussed.

Abstract: In this work, investigations on the localization and impairment of carbon residuals on device performance were performed. A green, ammonium thioglycolate (ATGL)-based solution process was used to fabricate the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber material. The resulting absorber triple layer structure was characterized in detail combining various characterizations methods to localize the carbon residuals from the utilized ink. Major differences were found between the upper and lower large-grained layer and the intermediate fine-grained layer. Furthermore, a formation mechanism for the absorber layer stack was derived from stopping the high temperature fabrication process and analyzing the respective samples. Investigations of the impact of the fine-grained intermediate layer on the solar cell parameters revealed that it does not contribute to the device performance.

Abstract: Several epidemiologic studies have revealed strong inverse associations between metformin use and risk of colorectal cancer development. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which plays a central role in intestinal homeostasis and sporadic colorectal cancer development, is regulated by phosphorylation cascades that are dependent and independent of Wnt. Here we report that a non-canonical Ser552 phosphorylation in β-catenin, which promotes its nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity, is blocked by metformin via AMPK-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling inhibition.

Abstract: Inorganic hydrated salts have many advantages over organic phase change materials, such as high thermal storage density, low-cost and non-toxic. Herein, we microencapsulated sodium phosphate dodecahydrate (DSP) with silica through interfacial polymerization combined with sol-gel process and systematically investigated the effects of the reaction conditions on the morphology and encapsulation efficiency of the microcapsules. SEM and TEM were used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the microcapsules, and the lattice fringes and crystal diffraction ring of DSP inside the microcapsules can be observed by high-resolution TEM and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The chemical composition and crystalline structure of the microcapsule were detected by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD), which demonstrated the presence of DSP. DSC results indicated that the microcapsule prepared at 40 °C for 8 h with the core/shell mass ratio of 4: 1 had the highest encapsulation efficiency of 75.3% with the melting enthalpy of 177.0 J/g. The good thermoregulating performance of the microcapsule was demonstrated by adding it to the building model and comparing its temperature variation with the model without any microcapsule. Owing to the facile preparation, large latent heat, good thermal reliability and excellent thermoregulating performance, the obtained microcapsules will have a good prospect in thermal energy storage application.

Abstract: We present a versatile, cost-effective formulation platform for highly conductive silver pastes used in front-side metallization of silicon (Si) solar cells. Pastes based on the capillary suspension concept include silver particles, glass frit and two immiscible fluids. Capillary forces inferred from the second fluid added only in small fractions induce the formation of a percolating particle network. This provides extended shelf-life and distinct flow properties adjustable in a wide range as demanded by the respective printing process, thus yielding residual-free sintered electrodes. Si-wafers are successfully metallized with such pastes using conventional screen-printing, knotless screen and Pattern Transfer Printing™. Paste spreading is studied via high-speed imaging during screen-printing on glass plates. Morphology of printed lines is analyzed using laser scanning microscopy. Electrical properties of the cells are characterized employing a solar simulator and electroluminescence spectroscopy. Results are compared to those obtained using commercial pastes including the same silver particles and glass frits. Paste performance strongly depends on the selected secondary fluid. Aspect ratios ≈0.4–0.5 can be reached and cell efficiencies ηeff ≈ 21% on Cz- and 18.6% on mc Si-wafers are obtained. Additional investigations are necessary to further reduce paste spreading and line interruptions thus improving cell performance.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer (PC) has become a worldwide malignancy accompanied by high metastasis and extremely poor prognosis. The critical roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in PC are generally summarized as molecular sponges of microRNAs (miRNAs). We intended to investigate the biological function and mechanism of lncRNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) in PC progression, especially in PC cell migration and invasion. qPCR was applied to detect the expression levels of XIST and miR-429 in PC tissues and cell lines. The roles of XIST and miR-429 on PC cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were assessed by wound healing, transwell, qPCR and Western blot assays, respectively. The regulating relationship among XIST, miR-429 and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was investigated in PC cells. XIST was frequently upregulated while miR-429 was commonly downregulated in PC tissues, especially in metastatic PC tissues. Knockdown of XIST in two PC cell lines caused inhibition of migration, invasion and EMT capacities. Forced expression of miR-429 exerted the similar tumor suppressing effects. XIST repressed miR-429 expression thus upregulated ZEB1, one of the targets of miR-429. ZEB1 mediated the tumor suppressing roles of XIST knockdown in PC cells. We identified the critical axis of XIST/miR-429/ZEB1 in PC cell migration, invasion and EMT, which may aid in developing new therapeutic strategies for PC.

Abstract: Tantalum carbide (TaC) based tandem coatings for selective absorption of solar radiation were fabricated by magnetron sputtering technique. Tandem structure of Ti/TaC/Al2O3 coating was deposited on a stainless steel substrate in which Ti acts as back reflection layer, TaC acts as main absorber layer and Al2O3 acts as an antireflection layer. The composition and thicknesses of the individual component layers have been optimized by adjusting the sputtering process parameters. Reactively sputtered TaC coating deposited at 85 W of sputtering power and 8 sccm of C2H2 flow rate showed an absorptance of 0.845 and emissivity of 0.14. After depositing approximately 50 nm thick Al2O3 on Ti/TaC, the absorptance increased to 0.957 and emissivity increased to 0.15. The refractive indices and extinction coefficients of each layer were used to simulate the reflectance spectra of the deposited tandem stack using SCOUT simulation software. For individual layer thicknesses of Ti, TaC and Al2O3 of 15, 55 and 50 nm, respectively a good match was obtained with the experimental and simulated reflectance spectra. The layer thicknesses were consistent with the thickness data of the tandem stack obtained from cross-sectional field emission scanning electron microscope image. The thermal stability of the tandem stack was examined in vacuum at different temperatures for a short duration. The results showed that the tandem stack is stable up to 500 °C for 2 h.

Abstract: In the present study, a thermo-economic investigation was implemented to assess the enhancement of a solar distillation system (solar still) performance and productivity by inclusion a natural fine stone (black basalt) as a porous sensible absorber. The effect of stone size (1 cm, 1.5 cm and 2 cm) and porosity of the porous absorber on system performance and productivity was presented. Two models with the same design and specifications (conventional and enhanced) were tested and compared. The results illustrated that the yield of solar still for 1 cm, 1.5 cm and 2 cm stone size was about 0.901, 1.005 and 1.075 L/m2 with enhancement about 19.81, 27.86 and 33.37%, respectively compared to conventional solar still. Also, the highest daily thermal efficiency of a solar still was about 22.6% at 2 cm stone size with enhancement about 32.07%. The economic analysis revealed that the freshwater produced cost per liter by solar still utilizing 2 cm stone size was 0.017 $/m2.liter, whereas that for the conventional still is 0.020 $/m2.liter with reduction about 17.53%. So, the stone size of the heat storage absorber has a significant effect on solar still productivity and performance.

Abstract: New series of brilliant yellow colorants with high NIR reflectance in rare earth doped scheelite type oxides, [(LiRE)0.125Bi0.75][W0·25V0.75]O4 (RE = La–Yb) and [(LiLa)x/2Bi1-x][WxV1-x]O4 (x = 0–0.3) were developed by the ceramic route. Different advanced techniques were used to examine the structural, morphological and optical properties of the synthesized colorants. The pigment series [(LiLa)x/2Bi1-x][WxV1-x]O4 undergoes a structural transformation from a monoclinic to a tetragonal scheelite phase and the second pigment series with various rare earth substitutions crystallize with a tetragonal phase. Strong absorption in the ultraviolet and blue region is observed for all the samples leading to brilliant yellow colorants with high solar reflectance. The band gap variation associated with the introduction of different energy levels between valance band and conduction band defines the various yellow shades of the pigments. Classically [(LiGd)0.125Bi0.75][W0·25V0.75]O4 pigment showed intense yellow color (b* 84.62) having NIR reflectance of 94% that has improved values than the commercially available Sicopal yellow. The probable applicability studies of [(LiLa)0·125Bi0.75][W0·25V0.75]O4 pigment as cool pigment was also exemplified on a concrete cement block and on a metal sheet. Chemical resistance tests are a sign of their permanence in the severe weathering conditions. These pigments are found to be promising ones for exterior coating energy saving applications.

Abstract: The focused solar water heating system can automatically adjust its focus according to the solar angle for higher heating rate and source temperature. One of the major challenges for such solar heat collector is stabilizing its daily heat outputs. This study intends to utilize a bulk low melting point alloy (140 °C)/expanded graphite (mass ratio of 9:1) composite phase change energy storage material to assure the stability and availability of the hot water output. To investigate the thermal properties of the proposed new material with different apparent densities, this study conducted scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests to examine its thermal conductivity, storage density, and stability. The results of SEM show that the porous structure of expanded graphite (EG) can effectively adsorb the alloy and prevent material leakage. The XRD test shows that the formation of the low melting point alloy and the expanded graphite is a physical process without new substance creation. The DSC test shows the phase change temperature of the composite phase change material (PCM) is about 140 °C with an enthalpy of 45.05 kJ kg−1 (0.46% different from its theoretical value). The thermal conductivity of the bulk alloy/expanded graphite composite PCM with density of 2083 kg m−3, 2500 kg m−3, 3125 kg m−3, 4167 kg m−3 and 5000 kg m−3 are 12.65 W m−1 K−1, 14.64 W m−1 K−1, 20.80 W m−1 K−1, 28.16 W m−1 K−1 and 32.64 W m−1 K−1, respectively, which has an improved thermal conductivity compared to pure alloys (12.44 W m−1 K−1), especially the bulk composite PCM with a density of 5000 kg m−3 has the best thermal conductivity and the volumetric energy storage density reaches 2.25 × 105 kJ m−3, higher than the phase change heat storage density of most PCMs for thermal management, such as paraffin (volume heat density is 1.8 × 105 kJ m−3）, and repeated heating in an environment of high temperature of 180 °C does not leak. The results suggested that the developed composite phase change energy storage material with an apparent density of 5000 kg m−3 has high heat storage capacity, thermal conductivity, energy density and is able to effectively improve the heat exchange rate of the focused solar water heating system.

Abstract: An efficient and environment-friendly process, consisting of acid-catalyzed sol-gel process combined with evaporation induced self-assembly, was conducted to build antireflective (AR) layer stacks for concentrated solar applications. Considering the external factors that may alter the optical properties of the system when operating outdoors, such as soiling, harsh climate conditions and alkali ions diffusion from glass, several stack configurations were proposed. Particularly, the effect of a methyl-silylating post-treatment, the presence of the inner layer and the optimization of sintering temperature have been devised in order to minimize soiling adherence and alkali diffusion from the glass substrate and to assure the required robustness to comply with the durability requirements. The assessment consisted of (i) an analysis of the optical transmittance, reflectance and refractive index and (ii) hydrophobicity and effect of water absorption on the external porous coatings in relation to the results of accelerated aging tests following photovoltaics standards. The main goal was to achieve the most rational design, based on a proper trade-off between cost efficiency, processability, optical properties and reliability during real life operation.

Abstract: We have synthesized three donor-π-acceptor polymers by crosslinking 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b'] and pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione with thiophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, selenophene as π-spacer. These polymers have been integrated successfully as dopant-free hole-transporting materials in fully open atmosphere solution-processed lead halide perovskite solar cells. Due to the synergistic impact of linear and long alkyl chains with different π-spacers, these hole transporters retard interfacial charge recombination and afford rich solubility and morphology resulting long carrier lifetime with uniform film coverage. In addition, these hole transporters possess a deeper highest occupied molecular orbitals (−5.40, −5.37 and −5.42 eV) and suitable over potential with perovskite valence band (−5.43 eV), favorable for efficient hole extraction. Further, the large number of S-based heterocycles helps to strengthen the interaction of the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface and high hydrophobicity (∼104°) facilitate enhanced stability with insignificant hysteresis. As a result, the power conversion efficiency has reached 14% under AM1.5 G without any additives in fully open atmospheric conditions. Our findings highlight the better energy transfer capabilities of additive-free hole transporters as a promising candidate for developing stable PSCs in the open air.

Abstract: Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) gathered great attraction as a yellow inorganic pigment which could replace the conventional chrome and cadmium yellow. However, its high cost over other yellow pigment restricted its usage. Therefore, there is a huge demand is existing to develop cost-effective BiVO4 inorganic pigment without compromising its optical properties. In this work, we demonstrate an effective strategy to develop low-cost BiVO4 complex pigments. Nano particles of BiVO4 decoration on white pigment are achieved by the citrate-gel method. An appreciable decrease in BiVO4 content (75%) has been observed. The reduction in the BiVO4 have shown a remarkable impact on the economic viability of the new complex pigment. The developed complex inorganic pigment exhibited excellent greenish-yellow colour (a* = −6.28, b* = 76.45), which is similar to pure BiVO4. An exceptional near infrared reflectance has been recorded, which is estimated as high as 90%. High reflective coatings of developed complex pigment displayed significant response for temperature shielding experiment, could achieve reduction of 8.4 °C in the interior temperature, compared to the commercially available yellow coating. Moreover, the present work demonstrates that developed complex pigment could be a potential replacement for BiVO4 yellow pigment.

Abstract: The preparation of VO2-based polymer coatings with simultaneously high visible transmittance and high solar modulation ability has been elusive for smart window design. In this work, reflux synthesis was examined with ammonium metavanadate as a non-toxic precursor, being reduced by aspartic acid in a water-based approach for the synthesis of monoclinic vanadium dioxide [VO2(M)]. The optimum synthesis conditions were determined for an oxidation stable, W-doped, monoclinic vanadium oxide showing a low transition temperature (Tc) between its monocline and tetragonal phases with small hysteresis. Systematically the molar ratio of ammonium metavanadate and aspartic acid, the annealing temperature and time on the VO2(M) crystal structure were varied. The results showed that an aspartic acid/NH4VO3 molar ratio of 0.6/1, calcined at 800 °C for 2 h delivered VO2(M) in high yields without containing V2O5. Optimized VO2(M) was then doped with tungsten with nominal concentrations up to 4 at.%. Again annealing conditions were optimized. The lowest Tc of 53.6 °C was found for the 3 at.% W-nominal doping concentration with an 800 °C annealing for 2 h. This material was shown stable against oxidation and exhibited a visible transparency (Tlum) of 68.3% at 22 °C and a solar modulation efficiency (ΔTsol) of 20.4% between 22 °C and 80 °C in a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coating. In addition, a pure VO2(M) phase was achieved at lower annealing temperatures and shorter times with the addition of W or PVP, which was not possible for the un-doped or pristine sample.

Abstract: Hierarchical K2Mn4O8 nanoflowers synthesized by a facile, fast, high-yield and low-cost molten salt method (MSM), have been investigated as a photothermal conversion material for solar vapor generation for the first time. Loading K2Mn4O8 into microporous poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane (PVDFM) forms a K2Mn4O8/PVDFM composite evaporator. This evaporator shows high solar-to-vapor conversion efficiencies of ∼80.8% and ∼91.2% under 1 sun and 4 sun irradiation, respectively, and a stable solar vapor generation performance. Therefore, this evaporator has shown a promising potential for interfacial solar vapor generation.

Abstract: Novel, simple, and ultra low-cost single-junction photoanodes consisting of highly-oriented black nanopyramid-arrays of Bismuth(III) Sulfide (i.e. Bi2S3) grown at low temperature by all-solution chemistries onto common, inexpensive and industry-friendly 304 stainless steel show remarkable performance for photoelectrochemical solar water splitting without any co-catalysts. The applied bias photoconversion efficiency (ABPE) reaches 6% on stainless steel at 0.85V vs RHE and photocurrent densities of ~20 and ~45 mA/cm2 at 1.23V vs RHE at 1 and 2 Sun, respectively in aqueous Na2S/NaSO3 solutions due to highly efficient anisotropic charge separation at the apex of the nanopyramids which results in the generation of 0.8 mol h-1 of H2 per gram of Bi2S3 photocatalysts.

Abstract: Organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite has shown to be one of the best light-harvesting materials for solar cell in the last decade. However, there still is needed a deeper understanding of phase and film formation for better control of device fabrication. In this work, we visualise the formation mechanism of Cs0.15(MA0.7FA0.3)0.85PbI3 perovskite by the sequential spin-coating method and how changes in the dispensing timing and substrate motion affect the formation process and properties of the final film quality. In particular, this is the first time that we are able to visualise and identify the different stages of the film formation: i) “initial formation”; ii) “perovskite deconstruction” and iii) “perovskite re-crystallisation”. This particularly applies to films that are sequentially spin-coated and involve the use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the “deconstruction” is caused by the formation of intermediate-DMSO-complex. These findings are validated by FTIR and XRD measurements. Comparison among processes also suggests that motion causes an earlier onset of deconstruction, which will lead to a slower re-crystallisation resulting in better quality perovskite film with less non-perovskite phase. This can be achieved by motion dispensing and dynamic processing (where there is no stoppage between the two sequential steps). Reasons for the earlier onset of deconstruction are the higher kinetic energy supplied by the dynamic process. This work has provided more insights into the complex stages involved in perovskite conversion specific to sequential processing. The knowledge will aid future process optimisation for better device fabrication.

Abstract: Previously, we reported that the expression of human epididymis protein (HE4) was correlated with the expression of RAB23 in ovarian cancer cells. Rab23 is a member of the Ras-related small GTPase superfamily, which plays a key role in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway. However, the function of Rab23 in ovarian cancer remains unclear. In this study, we explored the location and expression of Rab23 in ovarian cancer tissues and cells (CaoV3 and A2780), and further investigated the function and potential mechanism of Rab23 in malignant biological behaviors including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in ovarian cancer for the first time. Rab23 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and associated with advanced stage, and shortened overall survival time of ovarian cancer patients. We are the first to report that human epididymis protein (HE4) can regulate the expression of the Rab23 protein, and that knockdown of RAB23 decreases the proliferation, invasion, and migration abilities as well as inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, downregulation of Rab23 significantly inhibited Shh-Gli1 and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. Collectively, our results indicate that Rab23 plays a critical role in the malignant biological behavior of ovarian cancer and may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) contribute to transdifferentiation of stromal cells in tumor microenvironment. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a procedure of phenotypic remodeling of epithelial cells and extensively exists in local tumoral stroma. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Tricostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (SB) are reported to play important roles in the regulation of biological behaviour of cancer cells. However, whether TSA or SB is involved in control of EMT in colon epithelial cells induced by TAFs remains unidentified. In present study, we used conditioned medium (CM) form TAF-like CCD-18Co cells to stimulate 2D- and 3D-cultured colon epithelial HCoEpiC cells for 24 h and 4 d. We found that the CCD-18Co CM triggered multiple morphological changes in HCoEpiCs including prolonged cell diameters, down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of vimentin and α-SMA. Besides, ZEB1 and Snail expression and migration were also promoted by the CM. These phenomena were abolised by 5 μg/ml LY364947, a TGF-β receptor inhibitor. CCD-18Co induced up-regulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the 2D and 3D models, while no change of HDAC4 exprerssion was found. Treatment of 2 μg/ml TSA reversed the CCD-18Co-induced morphological changes and migration of the HCoEpiCs, and suppressed the downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin, α-SMA, ZEB1 and Snail. However, the suppressive effect of 4 mg/ml SB on the EMT was not observed. TSA down-regulated the expressions of Smad2/3, p-Smad2/3 amd HDAC4. Besides, TSA promoted the apoptosis rate (36.84 ± 6.52%) comparing with the CCD-18Co-treated HCoEpiCs (3.52 ± 0.85%, P < 0.05), with promotion of Bax (0.5893±0.0498 in 2D and 0.8867±0.0916 in 3D) and reduction of Bcl-2 (0.0476±0.0053 in 2D and 0.0294±0.0075 in 3D). TSA stimulated expression of phosphorylated-p38 MAPK in 2D (0.3472±0.0249) and 3D (0.3188±0.0248). After pre-treatment with p38 MAPK inhibitor VX-702 (0.5 mg/ml), the apoptosis rate of TSA was decreased in 2D (10.32%) and 3D (5.26%). Our observations demonstrate that epigenetic treatment with HDAC inhibitor TSA may be a useful therapeutic tool for the reversion of TAF-induced EMT in colon epithelium through mediating canonical Smads pathway and non-canonical p38 MAPK signalling.

Abstract: A novel bio-based polyurethane (PU)/wood powder (WP) composite is prepared as a shape-stable phase change material (SSPCM) for solar thermal energy storage (TES) applications. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarizing microscope (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and accelerated thermal cycling testing were performed to examine the chemical composition and structure, crystalline performances and thermal performances. The results indicate that, with only 3.0 wt% WP content, the PU/WP composites presented remarkable performance on phase change behaviors and thermal stability during PEG solid-liquid phase transition region. The maximum latent heat for PU/WP SSPCMs during melting and freezing process are 134.2 J/g and 132.4 J/g, respectively, and the relative enthalpy efficiency reaches 98.7%. At the same time, the obtained PU/WP SSPCMs exhibited reliable light-thermal conversion and temperature-regulated performance. Thus, the novel bio-based PU/WP SSPCMs displayed a high potential application as solar light absorber in the field of solar thermal energy storage and temperature regulation.

Abstract: Rho GTPases have been shown previously to play important roles in several cellular processes by regulating the organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. However, the mechanisms of Rho GTPases that integrate the cellular responses during regeneration have not been thoroughly elucidated. The planarian flatworm, which contains a large number of adult somatic stem cells (neoblasts), is a unique model to study stem cell lineage development in vivo. Here, we focus on cdc42, which is an extensively characterized member among Rho GTPases. We found that cdc42 is required for the maintenance of epidermal lineage. Cdc42 RNAi induced a sustained increased of cell death and led to a loss of the mature epidermal cells but without affected cell division. Our results indicate that cdc42 function as an inhibitor to block the excessive apoptotic cell death in planarian epidermal regeneration and homeostasis.

Abstract: Resveratrol (RSV) is a phytoestrogen which has been related to chemoprevention of several types of cancer. In this work, we show up to a 6-fold increased expression of ATP2A3 gene induced by RSV that triggers apoptosis and changes of intracellular Ca2+ management in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. We explored epigenetic mechanisms for that RSV-induced ATP2A3 up-regulation. The results indicate that RSV-induced ATP2A3 up-regulation correlates with about 50% of reduced HDAC activity and reduced nuclear HDAC2 expression and occupancy on ATP2A3 promoter, increasing the global acetylation of histone H3 and the enrichment of histone mark H3K27Ac on the proximal promoter of the ATP2A3 gene in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also quantified HAT activity, finding that it can be boosted with RSV treatment; however, pharmacological inhibition of p300, one of the main HATs, did not have significant effects in RSV-mediated ATP2A3 gene expression. Additionally, DNMT activity was also reduced in cells treated with RSV, as well as the expression of Methyl-DNA binding proteins MeCP2 and MBD2. However, analysis of the methylation pattern of ATP2A3 gene promoter showed un-methylated promoter in both cell lines. Taken together, the results of this work help to explain, at the molecular level, how ATP2A3 gene is regulated in breast cancer cells, and the benefits of RSV intake observed in epidemiological data, studies with animals, and in vitro models.

Abstract: We study the role of defects on the band-edges of bismuth-based ternary halide perovskites (A3Bi2I9) formed with cesium and methylammonium (MA) ions at the A-site. We consider a range of precursor-stoichiometries leading to different reaction environments. The intrinsic defects formed during the perovskite formation affect the materials’ band-energies. We introduce scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to probe the band-edges. Fermi energy of the perovskites could be seen to remain always closer to valence band (VB) as compared to conduction band (CB) inferring their p-type nature. Acceptor-type defects having a least formation energy have been considered to result the p-type behavior. Upon a variation in the precursor-stoichiometry in forming the perovskites, STS studies evidence a decrease in the band gap of the materials formed with BiI3-rich precursors. The change in band-energies occurs due to formation of deep-defects above the VB-edge; a shift in the CB-edge towards the Fermi energy is due to a change in the contribution of Bi(p) orbitals which form the CB of the perovskite. With methylammonium at the singly-protonated site, the material becomes defect-tolerant as evidenced by absence of deep level defects and an improvement in the parameters of solar cells formed with (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9.

Abstract: In this paper we perform a thorough investigation of the temperature coefficients of c-Si solar cells and wafers, based on both experimental data and device simulations. Groups of neighboring wafers were selected from different heights of four high performance multicrystalline silicon ingots cast using different dopants concentrations and Si feedstocks; Three different target resistivities of compensated silicon ingots based on Elkem Solar Silicon (ESS®), which are purified through a metallurgical route, and one non-compensated reference ingot. The wafers were processed into Al-BSF and PERCT type solar cells, as well as into lifetime samples subjected to selected solar cell processing steps before being etched down and re-passivated to assess the bulk lifetime of the final cells. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence imaging was used to study the spatial distribution of the carrier lifetime and the temperature coefficient of the lifetime. We observe a beneficial effect of higher doping levels on the temperature coefficients of the short circuit current JSC in PERCT type cells, with the most favorable temperature coefficients are found in the ingot doped to 0.5 Ω-cm. Increasingly beneficial temperature coefficients in JSC is also observed with increasing height in each ingot, which might be attributed to a combination of small variations in the dopant concentrations and to a clear increase in the temperature coefficient of the carrier lifetime with increasing ingot height. The latter point is also in agreement with the changes in the so-called gamma parameter of the open circuit voltage throughout the ingot. To build a more fundamental understanding of the experimental results the temperature dependence of the solar cells was simulated using PC1Dmod6.2. We find that the experimental temperature coefficients of the final cells can be reproduced in device simulations within 8% of and 14% for the VOC and JSC, respectively. The compensation level itself is of minor importance for the cell performance. Instead, the simulations indicate that the observed behavior in the temperature coefficients of the solar cells is mostly explained by differences in the net doping and carrier lifetime of the wafers.

Abstract: Potential induced degradation (PID) of solar cells can severely reduce a PV module's performance. In case of bifacial solar cells, the rear side is another source of PID as was found for industrially produced bifacial PERC solar cells from three different manufacturers. It is shown that a rear-side PID test can lead to more than 12% power degradation. The observed PID mechanisms are not completely recoverable implying long-term losses under field operation. This new, non-recoverable PID effects are characterized by a locally increased recombination at the rear side of the cells. From nano-scale analytics by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) are performed and PID related defects are traced back to a local Si corrosion and delamination of the passivation layers. At the Si passivation interface an increased amount of SiOx, Na and further impurities are found that indicate an electrochemically driven corrosion process under cathodic conditions.

Abstract: This study compares the electrochromic performance of NiO thin films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering cycled in lithium, sodium and small cations free based electrolytes, namely 1:9 LiTFSI in EMITFSI, 1:9 NaTFSI in EMITFSI and EMITFSI respectively. Regardless of the electrolyte nature, NiO thin films show similar electrochromic properties associated with an optical switch from colorless to brownish upon oxidation correlated to a modulation of transmittance close to 40 % associated with a good electrochemical stability. Interestingly, depending on the electrolyte nature, the EC behavior is correlated with various CV shapes raising the question of the mechanism involved. In particular, the reversible coloration mechanism cannot be only described by a single insertion/extraction of lithium ions, as observed for tungsten oxide in lithium media. The rectangular shape of the CV curves of NiO thin films in neat electrolyte and the behavior of NiO with various scan rates suggest that the EC properties result from a combination of both faradaic and capacitive contributions, with redox reactions largely occurring at the surface. Integration of NiO thin films in a full device is illustrated in double sided PANI/white electrolyte-EMITFSI/NiO EC devices showing simultaneous progressive color changes from blue to green and white to brown, on PANI and NiO sides, respectively.

Abstract: The effect of 14 organic cations on the optical properties of the lead iodine perovskite is analyzed. The electronic and optical properties are obtained using first principles. The absorption coefficients are split into inter-atomic species components in order to quantify all of the contributions. For energies close to the bandgaps, the main contribution is from the Pb–Pb intra-species transitions. For higher energy this contribution is still important in addition to I–I and Pb–I contributions, and to the 3 and 4 species term. Almost all absorption properties are qualitatively similar. Furthermore, this absorption coefficient splitting also allows the optical characteristics that the substitution of Pb by another element should satisfy to be identified in order to reduce the toxicity because of Pb while maintaining a high absorption capacity.

Abstract: Solar steam generation through sunlight capturing and energy conversion by photothermal membrane is a promising green and energy-saving method to tackle the current situation of water scarcity. The present work developed a simple approach for fabricating novel PPy-FexOy-CTS gel membranes via synthesizing polypyrrole (PPy) in chitosan (CTS) sol in situ, in which PPy as the photothermal conversion material was evenly dispersed in CTS gel network, the swelling properties of CTS result in a hierarchically (micro/nano) porous structure to provide water transmission channel. The optimized evaporation rate reached to 1.93 kg m−2 h−1 under one-sun irradiation (1 kW m−2) at room temperature (25 °C) and humidity (30%), more than the reported vacuum filtration membranes. The excellent property was attributed to PPy that synthesis in situ is more beneficial to light absorption and heat utilization while cross-linking CTS gel nanostructure reduces the enthalpy of water evaporation. Furthermore, the large area gel film was prepared by coating technology, when purified domestic sewage under natural sunlight, 13.68 L of water per square meter from PPy-FexOy-CTS gel membrane could be delivered daily and the TDS value of evaporated water decreased significantly. Note that the environmental-friendly membrane materials, excellent evaporation performance, as well as the easy construction of the solar steam generator, this work may contribute practical applications for alleviating clean water scarcity.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) with excellent energy conservation performance have been extensively utilized in solar energy storage system. In this study, a novel kind of thermal storage composite material based on calcium chloride hexahydrate (CaCl2·6H2O) salt hydrate as core PCM and cesium tungsten bronze (CsxWO3) nanoparticles as near-infrared (NIR) light absorbent additives is fabricated. The effect of CsxWO3 nanoparticles on crystalline morphology, thermal physical behaviors and light transmittance of CaCl2·6H2O are investigated. Additionally, thermal cycle tests are conducted for stability examination. Furthermore, thermal regulating performance of double layer glass window filled with the PCM composite is tested in small chambers by being sunlight irradiated under a solar simulator. All results manifest that with the incorporation of CsxWO3 nanoparticles, the salt hydrate PCM composite exhibits large latent heat, low supercooling degree and high NIR light shielding ability as well as good thermal stability. When employed as the glazing window of a test room, the PCM panel has functions of reducing indoor temperature fluctuations and increasing thermal inertia. Hence, the salt hydrate/nano CsxWO3 PCM design in this work shows great potentials for the development of solar energy storage products in energy conservation fields.

Abstract: Bismuth oxysulfide (Bi2O2S) has been demonstrated as a potential candidate for photovoltaic material because of favorite band gap (1.5 eV), effective charge dissociation, high carrier mobility, and long carrier lifetime. In this work, we synthesis the Bi2O2S nanocrystals by hydrothermal method, and incorporate Bi2O2S nanocrystals as a third component into poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b'] dithiophene-2,6-diyl] [3-fluoro-2-(2-ethylhexy) carbonyl] thieno [3,4-b] thiophenediyl]] (PTB7):acceptor [6,6]-pheny C71-butyric acid methy ester (PC71BM) binary polymer solar cells (PSCs). The results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ternary PSCs is obviously improved by 21.8% in comparison with binary PSCs (from 8.79% to 10.71%) by adding 1 wt% Bi2O2S nanocrystals. Introduction of Bi2O2S nanocrystals into the PTB7:PC71BM system can expand absorption range of sunlight in the PSCs, effectively enhance the crystallinity of PTB7 and optimize the surface morphology of photoactive layer, which leads to more efficient photon harvesting, enhances exciton dissociation, accelerates charge carrier transport and reduces charge recombination. Moreover, the addition of appropriate amounts of Bi2O2S nanocrystals into PTB7:PC71BM can effectively improve the lifetime of PSCs due to the improvement of crystallinity of PTB7. This work demonstrates the great potential use of bismuth compounds for photovoltaic devices fields.

Abstract: Silicon lattice vacancies exist in all silicon wafers, will increase in concentration due to high temperature processing, can form recombination active defects and have been proposed as a possible candidate for LeTID. Despite this, there have been relatively few studies in the solar field dedicated to investigating vacancies, their recombination properties or their interaction with hydrogen. In this work, we use high energy electron radiation to create large numbers of vacancies in silicon and study the lifetime response to subsequent thermal processes in the presence or absence of bulk hydrogen. The radiation results in the formation of radiation-induced defects which we interpret as being related to the creation of vacancies in the silicon bulk. Modelling of injection dependent minority carrier lifetime finds that the defects formed via this radiation process have different Shockley-Read-Hall properties to LeTID and are as such, unlikely to be related. Furthermore, this defect can be removed during low temperature annealing but only if hydrogen is present in the bulk of the silicon wafers. This is in contrast to samples with no bulk hydrogen which do not recover during low temperature annealing. The study thus finds no evidence for any link between LeTID and vacancies in silicon, but it does demonstrate the ability of hydrogen to repair radiation damage.

Abstract: Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) in breast cancer is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While there is currently no standard therapy, treatment options include craniospinal radiotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy. Craniospinal radiotherapy has not demonstrated improved survival and intrathecal chemotherapy is often poorly tolerated due to associated neurotoxicity. The use of systemic chemotherapy can be limited by inadequate central nervous system penetration. High-dose systemic methotrexate administered intravenously (HD-MTX), has been reported to improve quality of life and provide durable remissions for LM in breast cancer. We present three cases of metastatic breast cancer and LM with prolonged survival after administration of HD-MTX. Based on our observations and review of the literature, HD-MTX seems to be a viable treatment option for patients with LM in breast cancer, and in select cases, the use of HD-MTX, as part of a multimodality treatment plan, may be associated with prolonged survival.

Abstract: The diffusion of dopants from the poly-Si layer through the interfacial oxide into the crystalline silicon wafer is studied experimentally and via numerical simulation. It is found that phosphorus piles up at the poly-Si/SiOx interface but boron readily diffuses through the oxide into the silicon and thereby forms a less shallow junction which adversely affects surface passivation. Although boron diffusion was suppressed by using a nitrided oxide – realized by a plasma oxidation process – a reduction in passivation was observed due to deterioration of the interface. Via 1D and 3D process simulation it was established that diffusion through pinholes contributed little to the aggregate diffusion profiles measured by ToF-SIMS but direct diffusion through the oxide was the main diffusion mechanism. The segregation coefficient at the poly-Si/SiOx interface and the diffusivity in SiOx were determined. Using these parameters simulation-based predictions were conducted in order to pave the way for future optimization of hole-selective passivating contacts.

Abstract: A new type of gel polymer electrolyte composed of free-standing aramid nanofibers was used to fabricate all-solid-state near-infrared (NIR) electrochromic devices for NIR sheltering applications. This new type of gel polymer electrolyte showed excellent mechanical and heat endurance compared with currently available gel polymer electrolytes. The good film-forming ability of the aramid nanofibers makes assembling the electrochromic devices more convenient. The as-fabricated device showed an optical modulation of about 40% at 980 nm and achieved a coloration efficiency of 79.5 cm2 C−1, values that are larger than those previously reported for other electrochromic devices with similar structures. It is expected that aramid nanofibers-LiClO4-based electrolyte films with high mechanical and heat endurance will have potential applications in spacecraft thermal control, optical communication, and biomedical analysis.

Abstract: A series of five linear aliphatic diamides were synthesised via facile direct coupling of stearic acid (C18) with diamines of varying carbon number (18-n-18, n = 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) in a catalyst-free neat reaction. The compounds were investigated as potential renewable phase change materials (PCMs) for latent heat thermal energy storage. The thermal properties of the diamides were predictably related to the diamine chain length. TGA measurements indicated that the diamides evaporated before decomposition, with evaporation onsets increasing from 325 °C for 18-2-18 to plateau at 337 °C for the longer-chain diamides. The diamides display negligible supercooling and melt and crystallize at 140 °C–150 °C within a narrow transition span (<5 °C). Notably, both their melting and crystallization temperatures versus n present a maximum at n = 4, explained by peak hydrogen bonding and chain length considerations. As the distance between the amide groups increases, the transition temperatures decrease exponentially owing to the subsequent decrease in intermolecular hydrogen bond strength. The latent heat of the diamides presented a sharp increase from 165 J/g for 18-2-18 to plateau at ~210 J/g for the other amides (n ≥ 4). XRD measurements support the thermal transition behaviour; it shows that all the diamides crystallize from the melt into the β-phase, except for 18-2-18 in which the β-phase co-existed with the less stable β′-phase. Overall, the study shows that the diamides are suitable alternatives to classical petrochemical derived PCMs, expanding the currently limited library of organic PCMs.

Abstract: TiO2 is promising candidate for solar water splitting material. To enhance the insufficient absorption range of TiO2, TiO2 decorated with Au nanoparticles(AuNPs) structure have been studied intensively. This plasmonic approach can extend absorption range to visible light, but its incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency is still insufficient. Therefore, it is important to amplify surface plasmon resonance, obtained by using AuNPs. At the same time, for application to next-generation energy device, the way to improve this plasmonic effect needs to be available to large area fabrication, high reproducibility, low cost and so on. In this study, we successfully fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) moth-eye AuNP/TiO2/Au hierarchical structure for water splitting via direct printing method and deposition process. The proposed structure can effectively intensify the light–matter interaction owing to two mechanisms: Photonic mode light trapping attributed by moth-eye structure and enhanced surface plasmon resonance by gap-plasmon structure. Moth-eye structure, densely packed subwavelength-nanocone array, was easily fabricated by direct printing method. Using this moth-eye structure as a template, we effectively fabricated 3D moth-eye patterned gap-plasmon structure on 5 × 5 cm2. Compared with the two-dimensional (2D) AuNP/TiO2/Au absorber, the 3D moth-eye type absorber has higher absorption in entire 300–800 nm range. In accordance with this result, the 3D moth-eye absorber provides a photocurrent density of approximately 52.82 μA cm−2, which is approximately 2.3 times higher than that of the flat 2D TiO2/Au thin film (22.96 μA cm−2). Notably, it exhibits extraordinary enhancement of the photocurrent density—from 1.5 to 22.51 μA cm−2—in the visible range (≥420 nm).

Abstract: Perimeter recombination is a relevant loss mechanism, in particular for cells with a large perimeter-to-area ratio and with poorly passivated edges, e.g., cut or cleaved solar cells for shingled modules. We experimentally demonstrate that cut edges can be well passivated during front-end processing. The resulting cells have an efficiency of 26%. The designated cell area of our lab-type highly efficient cells is smaller than the total area of the wafer. This causes recombination losses in the masked perimeter region. We separate the active cell area from the wafer on two sides of the cell by slits to reduce the transport of carriers into the perimeter region. We apply a diffusion model to describe impact of the slits on the perimeter recombination. The slits have an effective surface recombination velocity of down to 9 cm/s, depending on the resistivity of the base. For a base resistivity of 80 Ωcm, the average cell efficiency increases by 0.7 %abs as compared to embedded cells and by 2.3 %abs as compared to laser-cut cells due to the passivated slits.

Abstract: This study analyses thermomechanical stresses in silicon solar cells after the soldering process by finite element modeling. An experimentally validated model shows compressive and tensile stresses, longitudinal and transversal to a busbar or a pad row on the surface of a silicon solar cell. The impact of the interconnector segments at and in between two solder pads was investigated and characteristic locations of maximum stress were identified. In addition, the influence of the layout of the contact metallization on the thermomechanical stress was identified by geometry variations to reveal design guidelines that lead to reduced thermomechanical stress in a solar cell after the soldering process. The model results reveal maxima of the tensile stress located at the outermost contacts. Furthermore, a significant influence of the distance between the outermost contact areas and the solar cell edge was determined; with decreasing distance, the compressive stress maxima are higher, but in contrast the more critical tensile stress maxima decrease. For connected pad rows tensile stress maxima are larger compared to single pad connection, which shows the influence of the interconnector segments in between the solder joints of a pad row. After several stages of thermal cycling, electroluminescence measurements showed, in compliance with the model results, contact damages, mainly at the outermost contacts. Furthermore, connected pad rows revealed a steadily growing amount of damaged contacts, whereas single solder joints showed no defects up to 400 thermal cycles.

Abstract: The electrical performance of a photovoltaic (PV) panel is based on its power conversion efficiency, which is inversely proportional to its operating temperature. Using a self-developed numerical thermal model, the performance of a silicon-based one-sun commercial PV panel has been analyzed by varying different physical and environmental factors. The physical factors considered, for each layer inside a typical PV panel, are the specific heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity, irradiance absorptance, thickness and finally, the often-neglected thermal contact resistance at the interface of each layer. The considered environmental factors are the ambient temperature, incident irradiance, wind speed and the mounting configuration of the PV panel. After adequately validating the developed thermal model, it was used for both steady-state and transient analyses, by varying each of the aforementioned factors one by one. These analyses provide a very detailed representation of the effect of each factor on the PV performance. Using these results, a PV designer can focus on the key areas of the PV panel's composition to maximize its output.

Abstract: A novel hybrid type electrochromic device (ECD) was fabricated, using a stable radical provider, 2,2,6,6−tetramethyl−1−piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) and two electrochromic (EC) materials, polyaniline (PANI) and heptyl viologen (HV(BF4)2). The PANI thin film and HV(BF4)2 solution were chosen as anodically and cathodically coloring materials, respectively. The TEMPO was selected to act as the anion storage species in pair with either of the electrochromic material. This type of assembly thus formed two electrochromic systems in one device, i.e., TEMPO−HV and TEMPO−PANI. The electrolyte for the ECD was composed of 0.1 M TEMPO, 0.05 M HV(BF4)2, 0.1 M TBABF4, and 1.0 mM HClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC), and was placed in between two ITO glasses. By varying the operating voltage between 0 and 1.5 V, the TEMPO−HV system showed a transmittance change (ΔT) of 46.2% at 550 nm. By varying the operating voltage between 0 and −1.0 V, the TEMPO−PANI system showed a ΔT of 45.5% at 700 nm. The complete system activation (both TEMPO−HV and TEMPO−PANI) was achieved by setting the operating voltage between −1.0 and 1.5 V, obtaining a ΔT of 53.3% at 550 nm. The estimated switching times for the total system were 3.1 and 3.4 s for bleaching and darkening, respectively. The coloration efficiencies of the ECD at 700 and 500 nm, for the green to blue transition, were 159.7 and 169.2 cm2C-1, respectively, while 88.8 and 23.5 cm2C-1 for the transparent to green transition. The proposed hybrid ECD was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV–Vis absorbance spectra, dynamic transmittance curves, and long-term stability test.

Abstract: We report for the first time the effect of a chromium-doped absorber layer on the performance of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin film solar cells. CZTS:Cr films were deposited on Soda-Lime glass substrates through a double step method that includes sulfurization of a sputtered stack of Zn–Cr/Sn/Cu metallic layers. Cr was introduced as a dopant in the Zn layer, and the electro-optical properties of the CZTS:Cr film were investigated as a function of the Cr concentration, showing a large absorption increase for wavelengths above 850 nm. Films with different Cr concentration have been used as absorber layers to investigate their effect on efficiency and performance of the solar cells. Finally, an efficiency increase from 1.86% to 3.96% was obtained with a Cr concentration of 0.04%. This 113% increase ratio is mainly due to enhancement of the current density assigned to a double step absorption of low energy photons and decrease in deep acceptor type defects. Empirical simulations show that this enhancement is also ascribable to the reduction of the acceptor-type defect density. These findings open the way to highly efficient CZTS solar cells.

Abstract: Compatibility tests involving four vegetable oils and three different solid materials were performed, with a focus on rapeseed oil and quartzite rock. The objective was to verify the relevance of using vegetable oils as heat transfer fluid in concentrated solar power plants with direct thermocline thermal energy storage. First tests consisted in using small crucibles to put in contact rapeseed oil respectively with quartzite, blast furnace slags and alumina for 2160 h and at 210 °C. On a chemical point of view, the oil composition was modified by ageing and contact with solids. However, thermal properties that drive heat transfer (density, specific heat, thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity) were not modified. Thermal stability temperature and flash point decreased and a correlation with the index of acidity of the samples has been found. Second set of tests consisted in putting in contact quartzite with rapeseed, palm, soybean and jatropha oils for 720 h and at 210 °C. Results confirmed that index of acidity can be a good indicator of the vegetable oil ageing. From the whole study, no incompatibility has been concluded, but one may recommend a limit value of 25 mg KOH.g−1 for the index of acidity to consider partial replacement of the vegetable heat transfer.

Abstract: Several studies have highlighted the underlying role of mesenchymal stem cells microvesicles (MSC-MVs) in acute lung injury (ALI). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) derived from MSC-MVs is partly involved in their therapeutic effects; however, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. MVs were isolated from human Wharton's Jelly MSCs. The rat model of ALI was established by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BLM). A co-culture model of alveolar epithelial cells or pulmonary endothelial cells and MSC-MVs was utilized. Total protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was determined by bicinchoninic acid method. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil in BALF were counted. ELISA was used for the determination of cytokines and HGF in BALF. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining as well as caspase-3 activity detection. HE and Masson staining of lung tissues was used for histopathology analysis. The expression of HGF and proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Treatment with MSC-MVs significantly inhibited BLM-induced apoptosis and fibrosis in lung tissues and PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, which was reversed by HGF mRNA deficient MVs. Intriguingly, these effects were completely abrogated by PI3K inhibitor. The therapeutic effect of MSC-MVs in ALI was partly mediated through HGF mRNA.

Abstract: Erythritol (ME)/polyaniline (PANI) form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) were prepared in isopropanol via a simple method. ME was dispersed in the solvent to form suspension at first. Form-stable PCMs were then obtained by covering the dispersed ME particles with PANI particles, which in turn were synthesized via surface polymerization of aniline in the solvent. The prepared form-stable PCMs were characterized by various characterization techniques. The results showed that the loading of ME in the form-stable PCM with good form-stability could attain 75%, corresponding to a melting enthalpy of about 260 J/g. The supercooling degree of ME in the form-stable PCMs was stably suppressed from 103 °C to 60 °C, which was resulted from that the PANI presented a lot of nucleation centers and facilitated the heterogeneous nucleation of ME. The solidification enthalpy of the form-stable PCM was improved to 180 J/g, which was 50 J/g higher than that of pristine ME. Accelerated cyclic melting/freezing tests showed that the solidification temperature and the latent heat storage capacity of the prepared form-stable PCMs remained stable over 100 melting/freezing cycles. The form stability of the form-stable PCMs were originated from that the ME particles were covered by a layer of PANI particles, and the PANI particles could adsorb the liquified ME. This work presented a protocol for preparation of polymer-based sugar alcohols form-stable PCMs.

Abstract: In this paper a contactless and non-destructive method for the determination of base resistivity of silicon wafers with highly doped surfaces is introduced. The method is based on photoconductance and photoluminescence measurements. Unlike existing methods for the determination of base resistivity, the proposed method does not require an experimental setup, which simultaneously measures photoconductance and photoluminescence signals synchronized in time. The method is applied to a set of test samples with highly doped surfaces representing a broad variety of samples present in industrial and laboratory environments. The results of the proposed method are compared to reference values which are inductively measured after the removal of highly doped surfaces. An mean absolute error with respect to the reference values below 4% is obtained for the investigated set of samples. This corresponds to a deviation of less than 0.1 Ωcm for typical solar wafers with resistivities below 5 Ωcm. Sources of uncertainties in the proposed method are discussed in detail. From that discussion rules of thumb for a reasonable choice of calibration and test samples are derived. A maximum error of less than 10% is expected if rules of thumb are followed.

Abstract: This work addresses the development of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) for Si solar cells featuring SiOx/poly-Si based passivating contacts. Minimizing the thickness of the parasitically absorbing poly-Si layer is essential to reduce losses in the generation of current. However, as the poly-Si shields the critical absorber surface region during the sputter process of an overlying TCO film, the degradation in passivation quality is more severe for poly-Si films below 20 nm. For a thermal annealing of this sputter damage, a trade-off between improved surface passivation and the formation of a transport barrier exists, which needs to be considered for contact engineering. By adjusting the DC sputter process and the subsequent curing procedure, effective passivation recovery of textured samples featuring ultrathin (<15 nm) n-type poly-Si carrier selective layers (iVoc of 735 mV) and a low ρc of 50 mΩcm2 of the c-Si/SiOx/poly-Si/TCO contact could be achieved simultaneously. Combining this process with a highly conductive and broadband transparent cerium and hydrogen co-doped indium oxide film, opens the door for the application of ultrathin poly-Si layers on the front side of silicon solar cells using exclusively industrially established processes.

The a-WO3 and c-WO3 films are prepared by adjusting the sputtering power, thus not affecting the phase composition of the other layers. The infrared (IR) emittance of both devices is studied in detail. The results show that the crystallinity of the WO3 layer greatly influences the IR emittance of the devices. The IR emittance of the a-WO3 ECD in the range of 2.5–25 μm increases greatly after lithium ion insertion, whereas the IR emittance of the c-WO3 ECD decreases. This difference can be explained by the absorption of IR vibrations and the reflection of the pseudo-metallic behavior of WO3. a-WO3 ECD exhibits a greater regulating capacity for thermal radiation, and its emittance modulation range is about 0.37 in the spectral range 8–14 μm and 0.30 in the spectral range 2.5–25 μm. The electrochromic technique is an ideal thermal control method for future space technology.

Abstract: In this study, crumpled-shape nanocomposite of nitrogen and sulfur co-doped ZnO–CeO2 (NSZC) was deposited on FTO substrate using one-step ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. Zinc acetate, cerium nitrate, and thiourea were dissolved in deionized water and used as starting solution. The samples were characterized using FESEM, XRD, UV–vis spectroscopy, EIS, and PL. The as-prepared nitrogen and sulfur co-doped ZnO–CeO2 nanocomposites were evaluated as high photocatalysts for degradation of methyl orange. Nearly 100% photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange was achieved for 180 min. The photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that co-doping of nitrogen and sulfur could promote the suppression of electron-hole recombination.

Abstract: The implementation of light management textures in thin-film solar cells often simultaneously causes an undesired deterioration of electronic performance. Here, we introduce a simple yet effective technique for improved light management in liquid phase crystallized silicon thin-film solar cells on glass. By imprinting pyramidal textures on the sun-facing side of the glass superstrate, absorber and functional layers of the device remain unaffected while light in-coupling is significantly increased. An increase of short-circuit current density by 2.5mA cm2 was observed by texturing the glass in this way, corresponding to an enhanced power conversion efficiency from 12.9% to 13.8%. Optical simulations allow to attribute the increase in equal shares to an anti-reflective effect at the air-glass interface as well as light scattering and multiple passes through the glass. The technology allows for independent optimization of optical performance without compromising on electronic material issues and is therefore useable for any other solar cell technology using a glass superstrate.

Abstract: Long-term and low-dose exposure to inorganic arsenic is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, C57BL/6 mice exposed to As2O3 showed impaired glucose tolerance, decrease in insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance were observed in the skeletal muscle and myotubes of mice that underwent As2O3 treatment. Decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (ISGU) was also shown by the As2O3-treated myotubes. Moreover, the accumulation of ectopic fat in mice skeletal muscle and myotubes was observed after As2O3 treatment. The upregulated expression of autophagy-associated proteins and the increased number of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) indicated that autophagy was stimulated in the skeletal muscle and myotubes of mice after undergoing As2O3 treatment. TAU could prevent the effect of As2O3 on mice skeletal muscle and myotubes, as mentioned above. The impaired ISGU, decreased insulin-associated proteins expression, and increased TAG content caused by As2O3 were reversed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and the As2O3-induced autophagy was inhibited by NAC, indicating involvement of ROS-autophagy pathway in the mechanism of As2O3-induced IR and lipid metabolism disorder. In summary, TAU protect against the As2O3-induced IR and ectopic fat accumulation in mice skeletal muscle and myotubes via ROS-autophagy pathway.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized as pulmonary arterial endothelial dysfunction and endothelial cells over proliferation, therefore, the repair of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells has been a common goal in treating PAH. In the present study, human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) were transfected with bFGF lentiviral vector and co-cultured with monocrotaline pyrrole treated human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs). The results showed that bFGF-ASCs improved the proliferation, viability and decreased the apoptosis of HPAECs, besides, improved PAH was observed in PAH rat models. Western blot analysis showed that the PI3k and p-Akt protein expression level increased in HPAECs, suggesting the activation of the PI3k/Akt signaling pathway. With the administration of LY294002, the bFGF induced HPAECs survival and PI3k/Akt signaling activation were successfully blocked. The present study demonstrated that bFGF transfected ASCs improved the survival of HPAECs by activating the PI3k/Akt pathway.

Abstract: Mesoporous tungsten trioxide (WO3) and nickel oxide (NiO) electrochromic (EC) thin films have been fabricated by sol-gel method with assistant of tri-block copolymer [PEO132PEO50PEO132] (F108). By controlling weight ratio of F108 and calcination temperatures, uniform and transparent mesoporous films are fabricated. Both WO3 and NiO films are comprised by nanoparticles with diameters of ca.10 nm, mesopores with pore size of approximately 6 nm are distributed in the films. The thickness of the films are ca. 400 nm. The as-prepared films have ultra-fast switching time during EC redox reactions. Applied with positive and negative voltages of 40 s respectively, the coloration/bleaching time of WO3 and NiO films are 5.7 s/2.3 s and 0.9 s/3.8 s, which is faster than that of comparative EC films fabricated by sol-gel method without F108 (coloration/bleaching time of WO3 and NiO films are 17.5 s/14.5 s and 13.6 s/4.9 s) and EC films fabricated by magnetron sputtering method (coloration/bleaching time of WO3 and NiO films are 29.4 s/21.3 s and 9.6 s/7.5 s). Quasi-solid state electrochromic device assembled with mesoporous WO3 and NiO thin films has excellent EC performance, such as fast switching speed (3.2/1.1 s for coloration/bleaching time), large optical modulation of about 45% (at 600 nm), high coloration efficiency (130.8 cm2/C at the wavelength of 600 nm) and good cycle stability. These excellent properties are derived from mesoporous channels in the films. For the mesoporous channels can shorten the diffusion paths and make it easier for ions to transport in films.
