Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells induce an immunosuppressive microenvironment that is a major obstacle for successful tumor immunotherapy. Dissecting the regulatory mechanisms between energy metabolism and functionality in Treg cells will provide insight toward developing novel immunotherapies against cancer. Here we report that human naturally occurring and tumor-associated Treg cells exhibit distinct metabolic profiles with selectivity for glucose metabolism compared with effector T cells. Treg-mediated accelerated glucose consumption induces cellular senescence and suppression of responder T cells through cross-talk. TLR8 signaling selectively inhibits glucose uptake and glycolysis in human Treg cells, resulting in reversal of Treg suppression. Importantly, TLR8 signaling-mediated reprogramming of glucose metabolism and function in human Treg cells can enhance anti-tumor immunity in vivo in a melanoma adoptive transfer T cell therapy model. Our studies identify mechanistic links between innate signaling and metabolic regulation of human Treg suppression, which may be used as a strategy to advance tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic bacteria inject effector proteins into host cells to manipulate cellular processes and facilitate the infection. Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs), an effector class in plant pathogenic bacteria, transcriptionally activate host genes to promote disease. We identify arginine decarboxylase (ADC) genes as the host targets of Brg11, a TALE-like effector from the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. Brg11 targets a 17-bp sequence that was found to be part of a conserved 50-bp motif, termed the ADC-box, upstream of ADC genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis. The transcribed ADC-box attenuates translation from native ADC mRNAs; however, Brg11 induces truncated ADC mRNAs lacking the ADC-box, thus bypassing this translational control. As a result, Brg11 induces elevated polyamine levels that trigger a defense reaction and likely inhibits bacterial niche competitors but not R. solanacearum. Our findings suggest that Brg11 may give R. solanacearum a competitive advantage and uncover a role for bacterial effectors in regulating ternary microbe-host-microbe interactions.

Abstract: The correct functioning of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase, is required for normal skin development and homeostasis. Cellular hyperproliferation induced by dysregulation of EGFR is tightly associated with structural and functional defects of hair follicles, skin lesions, and tumorigenesis. However, a number of questions still remain regarding the mechanism of EGFR activation and signaling. Here, we report that 4.1R, a member of the membrane-cytoskeleton linker FERM family proteins, plays critical roles in EGFR activation and signaling in keratinocytes. We demonstrated that knockout of 4.1R augments the excessive proliferation potential of keratinocytes by immunohistochemical analysis using murine skin samples. 4.1R−/− keratinocytes display enhanced EGFR-mediated Akt/ERK signaling by upregulating EGFR expression and phosphorylation, which can be reversed by either EGFR or MEK phosphorylation inhibitors. Mechanistically, coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining results confirmed that 4.1R can impair the activation of EGFR through direct binding to EGFR and reduce the downstream signaling. Taken together, a deficiency of 4.1R would therefore serve to sustain aberrant EGFR-mediated cellular signaling, leading to hyperproliferation. Our findings highlight the role of 4.1R in the regulation of EGFR signaling in keratinocytes and suggest that 4.1R acts as a novel regulator for EGFR activation.

Abstract: Summary
The CRISPR-Cas9 system has successfully been adapted to edit the genome of various organisms. However, our ability to predict the editing outcome at specific sites is limited. Here, we examined indel profiles at over 1,000 genomic sites in human cells and uncovered general principles guiding CRISPR-mediated DNA editing. We find that precision of DNA editing (i.e., recurrence of a specific indel) varies considerably among sites, with some targets showing one highly preferred indel and others displaying numerous infrequent indels. Editing precision correlates with editing efficiency and a preference for single-nucleotide homologous insertions. Precise targets and editing outcome can be predicted based on simple rules that mainly depend on the fourth nucleotide upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Indel profiles are robust, but they can be influenced by chromatin features. Our findings have important implications for clinical applications of CRISPR technology and reveal general patterns of broken end joining that can provide insights into DNA repair mechanisms.

Abstract: MAP kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3), a member of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase (DUSP) superfamily, has been widely studied for its role in development, cancer, and environmental stress in many organisms. However, the functions of MKP3 in various insects have not been well studied, including honeybees. In this study, we isolated an MKP3 gene from Apis cerana cerana and explored the role of this gene in the resistance to oxidation. We found that AccMKP3 is highly conserved in different species and shares the closest evolutionary relationship with AmMKP3. We determined the expression patterns of AccMKP3 under various stresses. qRT-PCR results showed that AccMKP3 was highly expressed during the pupal stages and in adult muscles. We further found that AccMKP3 was induced in all the stress treatments. Moreover, we discovered that the enzymatic activities of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase increased and that the expression levels of several antioxidant genes were affected after AccMKP3 was knocked down. Collectively, these results suggest that AccMKP3 may be associated with antioxidant processes involved in response to various environmental stresses.

Abstract: Summary
Living organisms can be primed for potentiated responses to recurring stresses based on prior experience. However, the molecular basis of immune priming remains elusive in plants that lack adaptive immunity. Here, we report that bacterial challenges can prepare plants for fungal attacks by inducing juxtamembrane phosphorylation of CERK1, the co-receptor indispensable for signaling in response to the fungal elicitor chitin. This phosphorylation is mediated by BAK1, a co-receptor for signaling in response to multiple elicitors. BAK1 interacts with CERK1, and loss of BAK1 reduces priming phosphorylation of CERK1. Juxtamembrane phosphomimetic mutations of CERK1 confer accelerated chitin responses and fortified fungal resistance without triggering constitutive immunity, whereas juxtamembrane phosphodeficient mutations diminish bacteria-induced protection against fungal infection. These findings reveal that crosstalk between cell-surface immune co-receptors can prime defense and demonstrate that juxtamembrane phosphorylation of plant receptor-like kinases can occur independent of kinase activation to place the protein into a prime state.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can serve as a versatile and scalable source of neutrophils for biomedical research and transfusion therapies. Here we describe a rapid efficient serum- and xenogen-free protocol for neutrophil generation, which is based on direct hematoendothelial programming of hiPSCs using ETV2-modified mRNA. Culture of ETV2-induced hematoendothelial progenitors in the presence of GM-CSF, FGF2, and UM171 led to continuous production of generous amounts of CD34+CD33+ myeloid progenitors which could be harvested every 8–10 days for up to 30 days of culture. Subsequently, myeloid progenitors were differentiated into neutrophils in the presence of G-CSF and the retinoic acid agonist Am580. Neutrophils obtained in these conditions displayed a typical somatic neutrophil morphology, produced reactive oxygen species, formed neutrophil extracellular traps and possessed phagocytic and chemotactic activities. Overall, this technology offers an opportunity to generate a significant number of neutrophils as soon as 14 days after initiation of differentiation.

Rafoxanide promotes apoptosis and autophagy of gastric cancer cells by suppressing PI3K /Akt/mTOR pathway,

Abstract: Rafoxanide is commonly used as anti-helminthic medicine in veterinary medicine, a main compound of salicylanilide. Previous studies have reported that rafoxanide, as an inhibitor of BRAF V600E mutant protein, inhibits the growth of colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, and skin cancer. However, its therapeutic effect on gastric cancer (GC) and the potential mechanism has not been investigated. Here, we have found that rafoxanide inhibited the proliferation of GC cells in vitro, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, and promoted apoptosis and autophagy in GC cells. Treatment with specific autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine drastically inhibited the apoptotic cell death effect by suppressing the switch from autophagy to apoptosis. Mechanistically, we found that rafoxanide inhibited the growth of GC cells in vitro by inhibiting the activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. This process induced autophagy, which essentially resulted in the apoptosis of GC cells. Results from subcutaneous implanted tumor models in nude mice also indicated that rafoxanide inhibited the growth of GC cells in vivo. Taken together, our findings revealed that rafoxanide inhibited the growth of GC cells both in vitro and vivo, indicating a potential drug candidate for the treatment of GC.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have become indispensable for disease modelling. They are an important resource to access patient cells harbouring disease-causing mutations. Derivation of midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons from hiPSCs of PD patients represents the only option to model physiological processes in a cell type that is not otherwise accessible from human patients. However, differentiation does not produce a homogenous population of DA neurons and contaminant cell types may interfere with the readout of the in vitro system. Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 to generate novel knock-in reporter lines for DA neurons, engineered with an endogenous fluorescent tyrosine hydroxylase – enhanced green fluorescent protein (TH-eGFP) reporter. We present a reproducible knock-in strategy combined with a highly specific homologous directed repair (HDR) screening approach using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). The knock-in cell lines that we created show a functioning fluorescent reporter system for DA neurons that are identifiable by flow cytometry.

Abstract: Summary
Urban particulate matter air pollution induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) from alveolar macrophages, resulting in an increase in thrombosis. Here, we report that metformin provides protection in this murine model. Treatment of mice with metformin or exposure of murine or human alveolar macrophages to metformin prevented the particulate matter-induced generation of complex III mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which were necessary for the opening of calcium release-activated channels (CRAC) and release of IL-6. Targeted genetic deletion of electron transport or CRAC channels in alveolar macrophages in mice prevented particulate matter-induced acceleration of arterial thrombosis. These findings suggest metformin as a potential therapy to prevent some of the premature deaths attributable to air pollution exposure worldwide.

Abstract: Summary
Prion-like protein aggregation underlies the pathology of a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. At present, few high-throughput screening (HTS) systems are available for anti-prion small-molecule identification. Here we describe an innovative phenotypic HTS system in yeast that allows for efficient identification of chemical compounds that eliminate the yeast prion [SWI+]. We show that some identified anti-[SWI+] compounds can destabilize other non-[SWI+] prions, and their antagonizing effects can be prion- and/or variant specific. Intriguingly, among the identified hits are several previously identified anti-PrPSc compounds and a couple of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for AD treatment, validating the efficacy of this HTS system. Moreover, a few hits can reduce proteotoxicity induced by expression of several pathogenic mammalian proteins. Thus, we have established a useful HTS system for identifying compounds that can potentially antagonize prionization and human proteinopathies.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating condition that can arise due to aging, cancer, corticosteroid use, and denervation. To better characterize the molecular genetic events of neurogenic atrophy, a previous study analyzed gene expression patterns in gastrocnemius muscle following sciatic nerve transection and found for the first time that Zinc Finger Protein 593 (Zfp593) is expressed in skeletal muscle and is induced in response to denervation. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed that Zfp593 is expressed in both proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. To assess sub-cellular location, GFP-tagged Zfp593 was expressed in C2C12 cells and found to localize to the nucleus. The Zfp593 protein possesses a putative zinc finger domain and is believed to function as a modulator of the Oct-2 transcription factor. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Zfp593 did not affect the ability of Oct-1 or Oct-2 to inhibit an Oct reporter gene in muscle cells. Finally, Zfp593 overexpression in cultured muscle cells resulted in significant repression of muscle cell differentiation and attenuation of ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, but did not vitiate protein synthesis. The discovery that Zfp593 is expressed in skeletal muscle combined with the observation that it is induced in response to neurogenic atrophy furthers our understanding of the molecular genetic events of muscle wasting.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and often fatal in current times. The role of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-induced cell death (parthanatos) in TBI has not been well studied. Our past study showed that oxidative stress-induced cell death includes parthanatos by confirming the occurrence of PARP activation and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). As oxidative stress plays a key role in pathological progression after TBI, we believe TBI may also be alleviated by the expression of Iduna, which is the only known endogenous regulator of parthanatos. Thus, a transection model in HT-22 cells was established for present study. Downregulation of Iduna aggravated the cell damage caused by mechanical cell injury, whereas upregulation of Iduna reduced mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mechanical cell injury but exerted no effect on apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. By contrast, Iduna prevented parthanatos by reducing PARP activation and nuclear translocation of AIF. We also investigated 2 novel p53-MDM2 pathway inhibitors, AMG 232 and Nutlin-3, which substantially reduced the protective effects of Iduna. These findings indicate that Iduna might prevent TBI by specifically inhibiting parthanatos and promoting mitochondrial function, with the p53-MDM2 pathway playing a critical role.

Abstract: Summary
Heme is an essential cofactor for many enzymes, but free heme is toxic and its levels are tightly regulated. G-quadruplexes bind heme avidly in vitro, raising the possibility that they may sequester heme in vivo. If so, then treatment that displaces heme from quadruplexes is predicted to induce expression of genes involved in iron and heme homeostasis. Here we show that PhenDC3, a G-quadruplex ligand structurally unrelated to heme, displaces quadruplex-bound heme in vitro and alters transcription in cultured human cells, upregulating genes that support heme degradation and iron homeostasis, and most strikingly causing a 30-fold induction of heme oxidase 1, the key enzyme in heme degradation. We propose that G-quadruplexes sequester heme to protect cells from the pathophysiological consequences of free heme.

Abstract: Summary
Type ΙΙΙ CRISPR-Cas systems provide robust immunity against foreign RNA and DNA by sequence-specific RNase and target RNA-activated sequence-nonspecific DNase and RNase activities. We report on cryo-EM structures of Thermococcus onnurineus CsmcrRNA binary, CsmcrRNA-target RNA and CsmcrRNA-target RNAanti-tag ternary complexes in the 3.1 Å range. The topological features of the crRNA 5′-repeat tag explains the 5′-ruler mechanism for defining target cleavage sites, with accessibility of positions -2 to -5 within the 5′-repeat serving as sensors for avoidance of autoimmunity. The Csm3 thumb elements introduce periodic kinks in the crRNA-target RNA duplex, facilitating cleavage of the target RNA with 6-nt periodicity. Key Glu residues within a Csm1 loop segment of CsmcrRNA adopt a proposed autoinhibitory conformation suggestive of DNase activity regulation. These structural findings, complemented by mutational studies of key intermolecular contacts, provide insights into CsmcrRNA complex assembly, mechanisms underlying RNA targeting and site-specific periodic cleavage, regulation of DNase cleavage activity, and autoimmunity suppression.

Abstract: The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has important roles in the regulation of energy metabolism, and AMPK activity and its regulation have been the focus of relevant investigations. However, functional characterization of AMPK is still limited in insects. In this study, the full-length cDNA coding AMPKα (TcAMPKα) was isolated from the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. The TcAMPKα gene contains an ORF of 1581 bp encoding a protein of 526 amino acid residues, which shared conserved domain structure with Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian orthologs. Exposure of female adults to oxidative, heat, and cold stresses caused an increase in TcAMPKα mRNA expression levels and phosphorylation of Thr-173 in the activation loop. The RNAi-mediated knockdown of TcAMPKα resulted in the increased sensitivity of T. castaneum to oxidative, heat, and cold stresses. These results suggest that stress signals regulate TcAMPKα activity, and TcAMPKα plays an important role in enabling protective mechanisms and processes that confer resistance to environmental stress.

We show here that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the mevalonate pathway leads to reduced human and mouse brown adipocyte function in vitro and impaired adipose tissue browning in vivo. A retrospective analysis of a large patient cohort suggests an inverse correlation between statin use and active BAT in humans, while we show in a prospective clinical trial that fluvastatin reduces thermogenic gene expression in human BAT. We identify geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate as the key mevalonate pathway intermediate driving adipocyte browning in vitro and in vivo, whose effects are mediated by geranylgeranyltransferases (GGTases), enzymes catalyzing geranylgeranylation of small GTP-binding proteins, thereby regulating YAP1/TAZ signaling through F-actin modulation. Conversely, adipocyte-specific ablation of GGTase I leads to impaired adipocyte browning, reduced energy expenditure, and glucose intolerance under obesogenic conditions, highlighting the importance of this pathway in modulating brown adipocyte functionality and systemic metabolism.

Abstract: Developing male germ cells are extremely sensitive to heat stress; consequently, anatomic and physiologic adaptations have evolved to maintain proper thermoregulation during mammalian spermatogenesis. At the cellular level, increased expression and activity of HSP70 family members occur in response to heat stress in order to refold partially denatured proteins and restore function. In addition, several kinase-mediated signaling pathways are activated in the testis upon hyperthermia. The p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway plays an important role in mitigating heat stress, and recent findings have implicated the downstream p38 substrate, MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2), in this process. However, the precise function that this kinase plays in spermatogenesis is not completely understood. Using a proteomics-based screen, we identified and subsequently validated that the testis-enriched HSP70 family member, HspA1L, is a novel substrate of MK2. We demonstrate that MK2 phosphorylates HspA1L solely on Ser241, a residue within the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of the enzyme. This phosphorylation event enhances the chaperone activity of HspA1L in vitro and renders male germ cells more resistant to heat stress–induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings illustrate a novel stress-induced signaling cascade that promotes the chaperone activity of HspA1L with implications for understanding male reproductive biology.

Abstract: Summary
The human gut virome is thought to significantly impact the microbiome and human health. However, most virome analyses have been performed on a limited fraction of known viruses. Using whole-virome analysis on a published keystone inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort and an in-house ulcerative colitis dataset, we shed light on the composition of the human gut virome in IBD beyond this identifiable minority. We observe IBD-specific changes to the virome and increased numbers of temperate phage sequences in individuals with Crohn’s disease. Unlike prior database-dependent methods, no changes in viral richness were observed. Among IBD subjects, the changes in virome composition reflected alterations in bacterial composition. Furthermore, incorporating both bacteriome and virome composition offered greater classification power between health and disease. This approach to analyzing whole virome across cohorts highlights significant IBD signals, which may be crucial for developing future biomarkers and therapeutics.

Abstract: The non-selective second messenger-gated cation channel TRPC6 (transient receptor potential canonical 6) is activated by diacylglycerols (DAG) in a PKC-independent manner and plays important roles in a variety of physiological processes and diseases. In order to facilitate novel therapies, the development of potent inhibitors as well as channel-activating agents is of great interest. The screening of a chemical library, comprising about 17,000 small molecule compounds, revealed an agent, which induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 2.37 ± 0.25 μM) in stably TRPC6-expressing HEK293 cells. This new compound (C20) selectively acts on TRPC6, unlike OAG (1-oleoyl-1-acetyl-sn-glycerol), which also activates PKC and does not discriminate between TRPC6 and the closely related channels TRPC3 and TRPC7. Further evaluation by Ca2+ assays and electrophysiological studies revealed that C20 rather operated as an enhancer of channel activation than as an activator by itself and led to the assumption that the compound C20 is an allosteric modulator of TRPC6, enabling low basal concentrations of DAG to induce activation of the ion channel. Furthermore, C20 was tested in human platelets that express TRPC6. A combined activation of TRPC6 with C20 and OAG elicited a robust increase in [Ca2+]i in human platelets. This potentiated channel activation was sensitive to TRPC6 channel blockers. To achieve sufficient amounts of C20 for biological studies, we applied a one-pot synthesis strategy. With regard to studies in native systems, the sensitizing ability of C20 can be a valuable pharmacological tool to selectively exaggerate TRPC6-dependent signals.

Abstract: Summary
The first-in-human trial of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based autologous transplantation was successfully performed on a female patient with age-related macular degeneration. Here we delineated the base-resolution methylome of the iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (iRPE) used in this trial. The methylome of iRPE closely resembled that of native RPE (nRPE), although partially methylated domains (PMDs) emerged in iRPE but not nRPE. Most differentially methylated regions between iRPE and nRPE appeared to originate from (de)methylation errors during differentiation, whereas errors at reprogramming resulted in aberrant genomic imprinting and X chromosome reactivation. Moreover, non-CpG methylation was prominent in nRPE but not iRPE. Intriguingly, xenotransplantation to mouse remodeled the iRPE methylome to demethylate a subset of suppressed genes and accumulate non-CpG methylation, but failed to resolve PMDs and hypermethylated CpG islands. Although the impacts of these alterations remain elusive, our findings should provide a useful guide for methylome analyses of other iPSC-derived cells.

Abstract: Human teratoma is a germ cell tumor that contains normal tissues (e.g., hair, skin or cartilage) differentiated from embryonal germ layers. Because of the feature of this tumor, we hypothesized that human teratomas contain multipotent stem cells that can develop into various non-cancerous normal tissues. In this study, we cultured neurospheres originally derived from a human infantile teratoma tissue, and the sphere cells were found to possess the characteristics of neural stem cells. Tumor tissues were obtained from an infantile immature teratoma at the time of surgical resection. In the primary cell culture, colonies were formed in two weeks and were individually cultured in serum-free conditioned neural stem cell medium (NSC medium). Colonies changed into spheres and grew in smooth round forms, or attached to the bottom of the dishes and extended processes and filaments around. Sphere cells were dissociated into single cells, and new spheres (secondary spheres) were formed in NSC medium. Cell differentiation was induced by culturing cells in serum-containing medium (differentiation medium), as cells spread and attached to the bottom of dishes and changed form. The expression of Nestin, Sox2, CXCR4, and (stem cell markers), β3-tubulin (a neural marker) GFAP (a glial marker) CNPase, SOX10 (oligodendrocyte markers) and NF-L in cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence and a Q-PCR. Nestin, SOX2, CXCR4 were abundant in both primary and secondary spheres. Neural and glial markers (β3-tubulin and GFAP, respectively) were increased in cells cultured in differentiation medium while stem cell markers were diminished. The oligodendrocyte markers SOX10 and CNPase were also found in both spheres and differentiated cells. In conclusion, spheres with the characteristics of neural stem cells were obtained from the primary culture of a human infantile teratoma. These spheres are considered to have the potential to undergo a natural course of neural development in humans.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease is associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Clinical studies investigating replacement of these neurons with in vitro-generated neurons are currently underway. However, this approach has been limited by difficulties in scaling up on-demand production of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons from pluripotent stem cells. Cryo-preservation may offer a solution, as it allows for banking of quality controlled mDA neurons. In this study, we tested different freezing conditions and found that optimal cryopreservation of immature human mDA neurons at an early differentiation time point was achieved in STEM-CELLBANKER medium using a controlled freezing program.

Abstract: Summary
Uterine endometrial cancer is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with advanced-stage disease. Here, we developed a three-dimensional cell cultivation method of endometrioid cancer stem-like cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity from clinical specimens. ALDH inhibition synergized with paclitaxel to block cancer proliferation. In the clinical setting, high ALDH1A1 expression was associated with poor survival. A high level of ALDH correlated with an increase of glucose uptake, activation of the glycolytic pathway, and elevation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Blockade of GLUT1 inhibited characteristics of cancer stem cells. Similarly to ALDH inhibition, GLUT1 inhibition synergized with paclitaxel to block endometrial cancer proliferation. Our data indicated that ALDH-dependent GLUT1 activation and the resulting glycolytic activation are of clinical importance for both prognostic evaluation and therapeutic decision-making in endometrial cancer patients. In addition, the synergistic effects of taxane compounds and ALDH or GLUT1 inhibitors may serve as a new clinical treatment option for endometrial cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from healthy individuals are important controls for disease-modeling studies. Here we apply precision health to create a high-quality resource of control iPSCs. Footprint-free lines were reprogrammed from four volunteers of the Personal Genome Project Canada (PGPC). Multilineage-directed differentiation efficiently produced functional cortical neurons, cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes. Pilot users demonstrated versatility by generating kidney organoids, T lymphocytes, and sensory neurons. A frameshift knockout was introduced into MYBPC3 and these cardiomyocytes exhibited the expected hypertrophic phenotype. Whole-genome sequencing-based annotation of PGPC lines revealed on average 20 coding variants. Importantly, nearly all annotated PGPC and HipSci lines harbored at least one pre-existing or acquired variant with cardiac, neurological, or other disease associations. Overall, PGPC lines were efficiently differentiated by multiple users into cells from six tissues for disease modeling, and variant-preferred healthy control lines were identified for specific disease settings.

Abstract: Purpose
The main objective of our study was to explore changes in the expression levels of differentially expressed genes associated with prostate cancer progression and to design a series of experiments to verify the function of differentially expressed genes.
Method
The transcriptome datas of 499 cases of prostate cancer patients was downloaded from TCGA database. Differential genes associated with Gleason score were selected and filtered out by p < 0.05 and spearman coefficient >0.3. KEGG signaling pathway was enriched by differentially expressed genes, and TTK was selected as the research object. The expression of TTK was tested in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines. The changes of biological behavior of prostate cancer cell lines were verified after TTK was knocked out by siRNA and tumorigenic effect of TTK was verified by shRNA in vivo experiments.
Result
The expression of TTK was positively correlated with Gleason score of prostate cancer, and the expression of protein and mRNA in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines was higher than that in non-metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Vitro biological experiments showed that TTK gene knockout could inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of PC3 and DU145 cells, and promote cell apoptosis. In vivo experiments showed that TTK knockout inhibited tumorigenesis in mice. It was found that the expression of CDK2 and CCNE1 decreased after TTK was knocked out.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that TTK is a gene associated with malignancy of PCa and could be a novel therapeutic target for clinical application.

Abstract: Adult testicular Leydig cells arise from stem cells in the neonatal and adult testis. The nature of these stem Leydig cells (SLCs) have not been well characterized. We have found previously that a group cells expressing CD90, a cell surface glycoprotein that may play roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and associated with the seminiferous tubule surface, have the ability to form Leydig cells. As yet, the relationship between this CD90+ cell population and SLCs reported previously by other groups is still unknown. In the present study, we systematically characterized these CD90+ cells by their ability to express multiple potential SLC markers and to proliferate and differentiate into Leydig cells in vitro. First, we have found by qPCR and immunohistochemical staining that the CD90+ cells do not express any of the markers of the common seminiferous tubular cells, including myoid, Sertoli, germ and Leydig cells, as well as macrophages. Moreover, when the CD90+ cells were isolated by fluorescent-sorting, the cells expressed high levels of all the potential SLC marker genes, including Nestin, Cd51, Coup-tf2, Arx, Pdgfra and Tcf21. Also, CD90-positive, but not -negative, cells were able to form Leydig cells in vitro with the proper inducing medium. Overall, the results indicated that the tubule-associated CD90+ cells represent a population of SLC in adult testis.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the function of co-enzyme Q10 (Q10) in autophagy of primary chicken myocardial cells during heat stress. Cells were treated with Q10 (1 μΜ, 10 μΜ, and 20 μM) before exposure to heat stress. Pretreatment of chicken myocardial cells with Q10 suppressed the decline in cell viability during heat stress and suppressed the increase in apoptosis during heat stress. Treatment with 20μm Q10 upregulated autophagy-associated genes during heat stress. The expression of LC3-II was highest in cells treated with 20μm Q10. Pretreatment with Q10 decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels during heat stress. The number of autophagosomes was significantly increased by 20μm Q10 treatment, as demonstrated by electron microscopy or monodansylcadaverine (MDC) fluorescence. SQSTM1 accumulation was diminished by Q10 treatment during heat stress, and the number of LC3II puncta was increased. Treatment with 20μm Q10 also decreased the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our results showed that co-enzyme Q10 can protect primary chicken myocardial cells by upregulating autophagy and suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway during heat stress.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and cellular metabolism promotes tumor aggressiveness by sustaining the activity of key growth, invasion, and survival pathways. Yet mechanisms by which biophysical properties of ECM relate to metabolic processes and tumor progression remain undefined. In both cancer cells and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), we found that ECM stiffening mechanoactivates glycolysis and glutamine metabolism and thus coordinates non-essential amino acid flux within the tumor niche. Specifically, we demonstrate a metabolic crosstalk between CAF and cancer cells in which CAF-derived aspartate sustains cancer cell proliferation, while cancer cell-derived glutamate balances the redox state of CAFs to promote ECM remodeling. Collectively, our findings link mechanical stimuli to dysregulated tumor metabolism and thereby highlight a new metabolic network within tumors in which diverse fuel sources are used to promote growth and aggressiveness. Furthermore, this study identifies potential metabolic drug targets for therapeutic development in cancer.

Abstract: There is no effective therapy exists for Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) till now. Few studies have been done on protective effects of green tea in pulmonary fibrosis but there is no single report on black tea extract (BTE) in pulmonary fibrosis so far. This study aims to investigate the anti-fibrotic effect of BTE against experimental pulmonary fibrosis. Four groups of animals were selected for this study. Group 1: control group mice. Group 2: mice exposed to bleomycin for 21 days, Group 3 and Group 4: bleomycin exposed mice treated with 25 mg BTE/kg b.w./day, p.o and 50 mg BTE/kg b.w./day, p.o. respectively for 21 days. Bleomycin exposed mice showed increased collagen deposition and wet/dry weight ratio, which were attenuated upon 50 mg BTE/kg b.w. treatment. The increased level of histopathological parameters in bleomycin-induced mice was significantly decreased after 50 mg BTE/kg b.w. treatment. Furthermore, 50 mg BTE/kg b.w. administration also decreased the expression of α-SMA in bleomycin-induced mice. This treatment with 50 mg BTE/kg b.w. also down regulated the expression of TGF-β and up regulated IFN-γ expression in experimental pulmonary fibrosis. The results of the present study put-forward BTE as a potential anti-fibrotic agent due to its attenuating effect on potential fibrotic markers.

Abstract: CSN5, a critical subunit of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), functions as a potential tumor promoter in various cancers. However, the biological functions and clinical significance of CSN5 in osteosarcoma (OS) remains unclear. Here, we report that OS tumors overexpressed CSN5 compared with normal bone tissues, and CSN5 overexpression was obviously associated with the malignant phenotype and poor prognosis in patients with OS. In addition, high CSN5 expression significantly promoted the growth of OS cells, whereas CSN5 silence suppressed the tumorigenicity of OS cells. Furthermore, we found PI3K/Akt signaling pathway contributed to the effects of CSN5 in OS cells, and blocking the Akt pathway significantly inhibited the actions of CSN5. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CSN5 positively regulated EGFR stability through reducing the levels of EGFR ubiquitination, thereby activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in OS cells. Moreover, our results shown that the oncogenic effects of CSN5 on OS cells were EGFR dependent. Thus, CSN5 has a central role in regulating diverse aspects of the pathogenesis of OS, which could be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for OS.

Abstract: Summary
Plant cell walls are made of polysaccharidic-proteinaceous complex matrices. Molecular interactions governing their organization remain understudied. We take advantage of the highly dynamic cell walls of Arabidopsis seed mucilage secretory cells to propose a hierarchical multi-molecular interaction model within a cell wall domain. We show that the PECTINMETHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6 activity creates a partially demethylesterified pectin pattern acting as a platform allowing positioning of PEROXIDASE36 in a remote primary cell wall domain during early development. This allows triggering the loosening of this domain during later development, in turn leading to proper physiological function upon mature seed imbibition and germination. We anticipate that this pioneer example of molecular scaffold within a cell wall domain is more widespread through other combinations of the individual molecular players all belonging to large multigenic families. These results highlight the role of cell wall polysaccharide-protein interactions in the organization of cell wall domains.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1 functions as a key mediator of tissue homeostasis via formation of Caspase-8 activating ripoptosome complexes, positively and negatively regulating apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammation. Here, we report an unanticipated cell-death- and inflammation-independent function of RIPK1 and Caspase-8, promoting faithful chromosome alignment in mitosis and thereby ensuring genome stability. We find that ripoptosome complexes progressively form as cells enter mitosis, peaking at metaphase and disassembling as cells exit mitosis. Genetic deletion and mitosis-specific inhibition of Ripk1 or Caspase-8 results in chromosome alignment defects independently of MLKL. We found that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is recruited into mitotic ripoptosomes, where PLK1’s activity is controlled via RIPK1-dependent recruitment and Caspase-8-mediated cleavage. A fine balance of ripoptosome assembly is required as deregulated ripoptosome activity modulates PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as BUBR1. Our data suggest that ripoptosome-mediated regulation of PLK1 contributes to faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis.

Abstract: The eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin, t-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1) ring complex or TRiC, is responsible for folding a tenth of the proteins in the cell. TRiC is a double-ringed barrel with each ring composed of eight different CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1) subunits. In order for the subunits to assemble together into mature TRiC, which is believed to contain one and only one of each of these subunits per ring, they must be translated from different chromosomes, correctly folded and assembled. When expressed alone in Escherichia coli, the subunits CCT4 and CCT5, interestingly, form TRiC-like homo-oligomeric rings. To explore potential subunit-subunit interactions, we co-expressed these homo-oligomerizing CCT4 and CCT5 subunits or the archaeal chaperonin Mm-Cpn (Methanococcus maripaludis chaperonin) with CCT1-8, one at a time. We found that CCT5 shifted all of the CCT subunits, with the exception of CCT6, into double-barrel TRiC-like complexes, while CCT4 only interacted with CCT5 and CCT8 to form chaperonin rings. We hypothesize that these specific interactions may be due to the formation of hetero-oligomers in E. coli, although more work is needed for validation. We also observed the interaction of CCT5 and Mm-Cpn with smaller fragments of the CCT subunits, confirming their intrinsic chaperone activity. Based on this hetero-oligomer data, we propose that TRiC assembly relies on subunit exchange with some stable homo-oligomers, possibly CCT5, as base assembly units. Eventually, analysis of CCT arrangement in various tissues and at different developmental times is anticipated to provide additional insight on TRiC assembly and CCT subunit composition.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent age-related human neurological disorder. The characteristics of AD include senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of synapses and neurons in the brain. β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptide is the predominant proteinaceous component of senile plaques. The amyloid hypothesis states that Aβ initiates the cascade of events that result in AD. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing plays an important role in Aβ production, which initiates synaptic and neuronal damage. δ-Catenin is known to be bound to presenilin-1 (PS-1), which is the main component of the γ-secretase complex that regulates APP cleavage. Because PS-1 interacts with both APP and δ-catenin, it is worth studying their interactive mechanism and/or effects on each other. Our immunoprecipitation data showed that there was no physical association between δ-catenin and APP. However, we observed that δ-catenin could reduce the binding between PS-1 and APP, thus decreasing the PS-1 mediated APP processing activity. Furthermore, δ-catenin reduced PS-1-mediated stabilization of APP. The results suggest that δ-catenin can influence the APP processing and its level by interacting with PS-1, which may eventually play a protective role in the degeneration of an Alzheimer’s disease patient.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-derived retinal organoids recapitulate many landmarks of in vivo differentiation but lack functional maturation of distinct cell types, especially photoreceptors. Using comprehensive temporal transcriptome analyses, we show that transcriptome shift from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P10, associated with morphogenesis and synapse formation during mouse retina development, was not evident in organoids, and co-expression clusters with similar patterns included different sets of genes. Furthermore, network analysis identified divergent regulatory dynamics between developing retina in vivo and in organoids, with temporal dysregulation of specific signaling pathways and delayed or reduced expression of genes involved in photoreceptor function(s) and survival. Accordingly, addition of docosahexaenoic acid and fibroblast growth factor 1 to organoid cultures specifically promoted the maturation of photoreceptors, including cones. Our study thus identifies regulatory signals deficient in developing retinal organoids and provides experimental validation by producing a more mature retina in vitro, thereby facilitating investigations in disease modeling and therapies.

Abstract: Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) are widely involved in cell biological activities and play a key role in controlling various cell phenomena. However, the underlying mechanisms connecting ROCK2 and PFKFB3 in osteosarcoma growth and metastasis are poorly understood. In this study, we explored and analysed the role and molecular mechanism of ROCK2 and PFKFB3 in osteosarcoma. We analysed ROCK2 and PFKFB3 protein expression in 51 surgical specimens from osteosarcoma patients and determined the correlation between ROCK2 and PFKFB3. In addition, we used Transwell and wound-healing assays to detect cell invasion and migration and CCK8 and EdU assays to assess cell proliferation. Herein, we confirmed that ROCK2 and PFKFB3 proteins were significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma compared with adjacent normal tissues. Further studies revealed that knockdown of ROCK2 significantly decreased the expression levels of PFKFB3; moreover, growth and metastasis were decreased in shROCK2 osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, upregulation of PFKFB3 rescued the decreased proliferation and metastasis induced by ROCK2 knockdown, whereas knockdown of PFKFB3 decreased ROCK2-enhanced osteosarcoma proliferation and metastasis. These results suggest that PFKFB3 is essential for ROCK2-mediated proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells. Mechanistically, ROCK2 stabilizes PFKFB3 expression by modifying its ubiquitination and degradation. Taken together, our results link two drivers of proliferation and metastasis in osteosarcoma and identify a novel pathway for PFKFB3 regulation. Thus, we provide new evidence of the biological and clinical significance of PFKFB3 as a potential biomarker for osteosarcoma.

Abstract: The only effective clinical treatment for many end-stage lung diseases is lung transplantation. However, chronic rejection of transplanted lung affects the long-term efficacy of lung transplantation to a large extent, thereby limiting the clinical application of lung transplantation. Occlusive bronchiolitis (OB) is a major cause of chronic functional loss of the transplanted lung. However, the OB pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, studying the OB pathogenesis and finding effective intervention methods are highly important. This study analyzed changes in the expression profile of microRNAs and transcription factors in mice with OB after orthotopic tracheal transplantation. miR-27a-3p was upregulated in lung tissue 20 days after transplantation. Transcription factor microarray analysis revealed that Smad3 was significantly downregulated. A miRNA–mRNA interaction network was constructed, and specific regulatory effects of miR-27a-3p on Smad3 were found. Smad3 was strongly associated with tumorigenesis and organ fibrosis. Compared with the control group, miR-27a-3p inhibited the epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of lung epithelial cells. In addition, miR-27a-3p inhibition promoted the invasion and migration of lung epithelial cells. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-27a-3p can regulate the promoter activity of Smad3. MiR-27a-3p also inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Western blot results showed that miR-27a-3p can upregulate the E-cadherin expression and downregulate the expression of vimentin, fibronectin, and α-SMA. By studying the OB pathogenesis, we found that inhibition or alteration of the occurrence of EMT may reduce the proportion of chronic rejection of lung transplantation. MiR-27a-3p may also be developed as a new drug for the OB therapy. This finding will provide many possibilities for OB treatment and improve the prognosis of patients with OB.

Abstract: Summary
Disease-causing mutations in many neurodegenerative disorders lead to proteinopathies that trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, few therapeutic options exist for patients with these diseases. Using an in vitro screening platform to identify compounds that protect human motor neurons from ER stress-mediated degeneration, we discovered that compounds targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K) family are neuroprotective. The kinase inhibitor URMC-099 (compound 1) stood out as a promising lead compound for further optimization. We coupled structure-based compound design with functional activity testing in neurons subjected to ER stress to develop a series of analogs with improved MAP4K inhibition and concomitant increases in potency and efficacy. Further structural modifications were performed to enhance the pharmacokinetic profiles of the compound 1 derivatives. Prostetin/12k emerged as an exceptionally potent, metabolically stable, and blood-brain barrier-penetrant compound that is well suited for future testing in animal models of neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue virus assembly requires cleavage of viral C-prM-E polyprotein into three structural proteins (capsid, premembrane, and envelope), packaging of viral RNA with C protein into nucleocapsid, and budding of prM and E proteins into virions. The molecular mechanisms underlying these assembly events are unclear. Here, we show that dengue nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A protein) recruits viral RNA, structural proteins, and protease to the site of virion assembly and coordinates nucleocapsid and virus formation. The last 285 nucleotides of viral 3′ UTR serve as a “recruiting signal for packaging” that binds to a cytosolic loop of NS2A. This interaction allows NS2A to recruit nascent RNA from the replication complex to the virion assembly site. NS2A also recruits the C-prM-E polyprotein and NS2B-NS3 protease to the virion assembly site by interacting with prM, E, and NS3, leading to coordinated C-prM-E cleavage. Mature C protein assembles onto genomic RNA to form nucleocapsid, followed by prM and E envelopment and virion formation.

Abstract: Summary
Biallelic inactivation of SMARCB1, encoding a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is the hallmark genetic aberration of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT). Here, we report how loss of SMARCB1 affects the epigenome in these tumors. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on primary tumors for a series of active and repressive histone marks, we identified the chromatin states differentially represented in ATRTs compared with other brain tumors and non-neoplastic brain. Re-expression of SMARCB1 in ATRT cell lines enabled confirmation of our genome-wide findings for the chromatin states. Additional generation of ChIP-seq data for SWI/SNF and Polycomb group proteins and the transcriptional repressor protein REST determined differential dependencies of SWI/SNF and Polycomb complexes in regulation of diverse gene sets in ATRTs.

Abstract: Inositol phosphate synthase (IPS) is a rate-limiting enzyme in myo-inositol biosynthesis, which can regulate stress responses in plants and animals. However, there are few studies on the function of IPS in insects, especially in Apis cerana cerana. In this study, the inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1-B gene (AccIPS1-B) was isolated from Apis cerana cerana, and its connection to antioxidant defence was investigated. The open reading frame of AccIPS1-B was 1542 bp, encoding a 513 amino acid polypeptide. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression level of AccIPS1-B was highest in pupae of Apis cerana cerana, and it was expressed at higher levels in the thorax than in other tissues tested. Moreover, the expression of AccIPS1-B was significantly upregulated by abiotic stresses. The recombinant AccIPS1-B also displayed significant tolerance to cumene hydroperoxide and HgCl2. In addition, knockdown of AccIPS1-B significantly suppressed the expression of most of the antioxidant genes and decreased the antioxidant enzymatic activities of SOD, POD, and GST. Taken together, these findings indicate that AccIPS1-B may be involved in the response to antioxidant defence and development in Apis cerana cerana.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotics alter microbiota composition and increase infection susceptibility. However, the generalizable effects of antibiotics on and the contribution of environmental variables to gut commensals remain unclear. To address this, we tracked microbiota dynamics with high temporal and taxonomic resolution during antibiotic treatment in a controlled murine system by isolating variables such as diet, treatment history, and housing co-inhabitants. Human microbiotas were remarkably resilient and recovered during antibiotic treatment, with transient dominance of resistant Bacteroides and taxa-asymmetric diversity reduction. In certain cases, in vitro sensitivities were not predictive of in vivo responses, underscoring the significance of host and community context. A fiber-deficient diet exacerbated microbiota collapse and delayed recovery. Species replacement through cross housing after ciprofloxacin treatment established resilience to a second treatment. Single housing drastically disrupted recovery, highlighting the importance of environmental reservoirs. Our findings highlight deterministic microbiota adaptations to perturbations and the translational potential for modulating diet, sanitation, and microbiota composition during antibiotics.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common malignancy of bone that occurs in young adults and children, with a five-year survival rate of 60–70%. Metastasis of osteosarcoma maintains an even poorer prognosis. GREM1 plays an important role in regulating organogenesis, body patterning, and tissue differentiation. However, there are limited studies on GREM1 in osteosarcomas. This study was carried out to characterize the expression and function of GREM1 in osteosarcoma cells, thus extending our understanding of osteosarcoma metastasis. GREM1 expression was detected in hBMSC, hFOB1.19, Saos-2, MG63 and U2OS cell lines using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches were used to assess the biological function of GREM1 in U2OS cells. The effects of GREM1 on U2OS cell proliferation were examined using the CCK-8 and colony formation assay. Migration and invasion ability were confirmed by the wound healing and Transwell assay, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to analyse the effect of GREM1 on the cell cycle and apoptosis. The expression of GREM1 targets was evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The expression of GREM1 was significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma. GREM1 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of U2OS cells. GREM1 overexpression suppressed tumour cell-induced endothelial cell migration and invasion ability. The effect of GREM1 may be transduced through regulation of the BMP target transcription factor inhibitor of MMP-2 and -9 as well as Id1. GREM1 overexpression and knockdown regulates the tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma in vivo. In conclusion, GREM1 is downregulated in osteosarcoma cells, and overexpression of GREM1 inhibits the proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis abilities of osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Although human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have emerged as a novel platform for heart regeneration, disease modeling, and drug screening, their immaturity significantly hinders their application. A hallmark of postnatal cardiomyocyte maturation is the metabolic substrate switch from glucose to fatty acids. We hypothesized that fatty acid supplementation would enhance hPSC-CM maturation. Fatty acid treatment induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and significantly increases cardiomyocyte force production. The improvement in force generation is accompanied by enhanced calcium transient peak height and kinetics, and by increased action potential upstroke velocity and membrane capacitance. Fatty acids also enhance mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity. RNA sequencing showed that fatty acid treatment upregulates genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and downregulates genes in lipid synthesis. Signal pathway analyses reveal that fatty acid treatment results in phosphorylation and activation of multiple intracellular kinases. Thus, fatty acids increase human cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, force generation, calcium dynamics, action potential upstroke velocity, and oxidative capacity. This enhanced maturation should facilitate hPSC-CM usage for cell therapy, disease modeling, and drug/toxicity screens.

Abstract: Heme homeostasis is of vital importance to many biological processes associated with cell redox activity. However, the role of heme in the doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity is still not clear. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that heme is related to the DOX-induced oxidative stress and inhibition of heme expression may protect H9c2 cardiomyocytes against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. For the evaluation of heme changing under doxorubicin treatment, H9c2 cells were treated with 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/mL doxorubicin respectively. H9c2 cells were divided into 5 groups: Control group (cells were cultured without intervention), DOX group (cells were treated with 2 mg/mL doxorubicin for 6 h), Heme depletion+DOX group (cells were cultured with heme-depleted serum media, 0.5mM succinylacetone and 2 mg/mL doxorubicin), Heme group (cells were treated with 30μm heme), and Heme depletion+DOX+Heme group. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI. The intracellular oxidant levels were measured by DCFH-DA fluorescence. The levels of heme were detected by ELISA. Doxorubicin significantly increased intracellular heme level from 5013 ± 187 ng/mL to the highest level of 11,720 ± 107 ng/mL, as well as the intracellular oxidants and cell apoptosis rate elevated by the increase of doxorubicin concentration. Heme depletion can significantly suppress the DOX-induced apoptosis from 39.8 ± 0.5% to 20.8 ± 0.5% (p < 0.001). Re-supplemented with exogenous heme partially but significantly restored the DOX-induced apoptosis. Heme plays an important role in doxorubicin toxicity–induced cardiomyocyte injury. By appropriate reduction in the accumulation of free heme in cardiomyocytes, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity may be alleviated.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an essential cell source in tissue engineering, studies of development, and disease modeling. Efficient, broadly amenable protocols for rapid lineage induction of hPSCs are of great interest in the stem cell biology field. We describe a simple, robust method for differentiation of hPSCs into mesendoderm in defined conditions utilizing single-cell seeding (SCS) and BMP4 and Activin A (BA) treatment. BA treatment was readily incorporated into existing protocols for chondrogenic and endothelial progenitor cell differentiation, while fine-tuning of BA conditions facilitated definitive endoderm commitment. After prolonged differentiation in vitro or in vivo, BA pretreatment resulted in higher mesoderm and endoderm levels at the expense of ectoderm formation. These data demonstrate that SCS with BA treatment is a powerful method for induction of mesendoderm that can be adapted for use in mesoderm and endoderm differentiation.

MicroRNA regulation of CTP synthase and cytoophidium in Drosophila melanogaster,

Abstract: CTPsyn is a crucial metabolic enzyme which synthesizes CTP nucleotides. It has the extraordinary ability to compartmentalize into filaments termed cytoophidia. Though the structure is evolutionarily conserved across kingdoms, the mechanisms behind their formation remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNA capable of directing mRNA silencing and degradation. D. melanogaster has a high total gene count to miRNA gene number ratio, alluding to the possibility that CTPsyn too may come under their regulation. A thorough miRNA overexpression involving 123 miRNAs was conducted, followed by CTPsyn-specific staining upon cytoophidia-rich egg chambers. This revealed a small group of candidates which confer either a lengthening or truncating effect on cytoophidia, suggesting they may play a role in regulating CTPsyn. MiR-975 and miR-1014 are both cytoophidia-elongating, whereas miR-190 and miR-932 are cytoophidia-shortening. Though target prediction shows that miR-975 and miR-932 do indeed have binding sites on CTPsyn mRNA, in vitro assays instead revealed a low probability of this being true, instead indicating that the effects asserted by overexpressed miRNAs indirectly reach CTPsyn and its cytoophidia through the actions of middling elements. In silico target prediction and qPCR quantification indicated that, at least for miR-932 and miR-1014, these undetermined elements may be players in fat metabolism. This is the first study to thoroughly investigate miRNAs in connection to CTPsyn expression and activity in any species. The findings presented could serve as a basis for further queries into not only the fundamental aspects of the enzyme's regulation, but may uncover new facets of closely related pathways as well.

Abstract: Background
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies and it is the eighth most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GSG2 (HASPIN) in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer.
Material and methods
GSG2 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue samples, and by qRT-PCR and Western blot assay in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay. Giemsa staining was used for analyzing colony formation. Cell cycle and cell apoptosis were determined using Fluorescence activated Cells Sorting. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were applied for examining cell migration. The molecular mechanism was investigated by human apoptosis antibody array. Tumor-bearing animal model was constructed to verify the effects of GSG2 on pancreatic cancer in vivo.
Results
GSG2 expression was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and human pancreatic cancer cell lines: PANC-1 and SW1990. Higher expression of GSG2 in tumor samples was associated with poorer prognosis. GSG2 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, metastasis and promoted cell apoptosis, which was also verified in vivo. In addition, GSG2 knockdown blocked the cell cycle in G2. It was also found that downregulation of GSG2 inhibited Bcl-2, Bcl-w, cIAP, HSP60 and Livin expression as well as promoted IGFBP-6 expression.
Conclusion
This study revealed that GSG2 upregulation was associated with pancreatic cancer progression. GSG2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration, blocked cell cycle at G2 phase, and induced cell apoptosis. Therefore, GSG2 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer therapy and a market for prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
Frequent SPOP mutation defines the molecular feature underlying one of seven sub-types of human prostate cancer (PrCa). However, it remains largely elusive how SPOP functions as a tumor suppressor in PrCa. Here, we report that SPOP suppresses stem cell traits of both embryonic stem cells and PrCa cells through promoting Nanog poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Mechanistically, Nanog, but not other pluripotency-determining factors including Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, specifically interacts with SPOP via a conservative degron motif. Importantly, cancer-derived mutations in SPOP or at the Nanog-degron (S68Y) disrupt SPOP-mediated destruction of Nanog, leading to elevated cancer stem cell traits and PrCa progression. Notably, we identify the Pin1 oncoprotein as an upstream Nanog regulator that impairs its recognition by SPOP and thereby stabilizes Nanog. Thus, Pin1 inhibitors promote SPOP-mediated destruction of Nanog, which provides the molecular insight and rationale to use Pin1 inhibitor(s) for targeted therapies of PrCa patients with wild-type SPOP.

Abstract: Phosphorylation is an important event in cell signaling that is modulated by kinases and phosphatases. In Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, approximately 2% of the protein-coding genes encode for protein kinases. This parasite has a heteroxenic life cycle with four different development stages. In the midgut of invertebrate vector, epimastigotes differentiate into metacyclic trypomastigotes in a process known as metacyclogenesis. This process can be reproduced in vitro by submitting parasites to nutritional stress (NS). Aiming to contribute to the elucidation of mechanisms that trigger metacyclogenesis, we applied super-SILAC (super-stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) and LC-MS/MS to analyze different points during NS. This analysis resulted in the identification of 4205 protein groups and 3643 phosphopeptides with the location of 4846 phosphorylation sites. Several phosphosites were considered modulated along NS and are present in proteins associated with various functions, such as fatty acid synthesis and the regulation of protein expression, reinforcing the importance of phosphorylation and signaling events to the parasite. These modulated sites may be triggers of metacyclogenesis.

Abstract: The tumor microenvironment harbors multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms, many of which involve suppressive immune cells. B regulatory (Breg) cells, as critical regulators of immune responses, were investigated in patients with gastric carcinoma. In the present study, the B cells that expressed IL-10 were highly enriched in tumor-infiltrating B cells, and could also be found at reduced frequencies in circulating B cells. These cells expressed high CD19 and CD20, and were almost exclusively CD27+CD10−. The IL-10 expression was significantly higher in CD27+CD10--sorted B cells than in CD27−CD10--sorted B cells. In an in vitro coculture of B cells and autologous T cells, CD27+CD10− B cells were capable of reducing the levels of CD4 T cell-mediated IFNγ, TNF, and IL-17 expression and the levels of CD8 T cell-mediated IFNγ and TNF expression. These regulatory effects were dependent on IL-10 as well as CD80/CD86. Interestingly, CD27+CD10− B cells also significantly elevated IL-10 production from CD4 and CD8 T cells in an IL-10-dependent manner. Overall, we here report enrichment of IL-10-expressing CD27+CD10− B cells in the intratumoral environment, which could significantly alter the cytokine production profile by CD4 and CD8 T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Phage defense systems are often found on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), where they constitutively defend against invaders or are induced to respond to new assaults. Phage satellites, one type of MGE, are induced during phage infection to promote their own transmission, reducing phage production and protecting their hosts in the process. One such satellite in Vibrio cholerae, phage-inducible chromosomal island-like element (PLE), sabotages the lytic phage ICP1, which triggers PLE excision from the bacterial chromosome, replication, and transduction to neighboring cells. Analysis of patient stool samples from different geographic regions revealed that ICP1 has evolved to possess one of two syntenic loci encoding an SF1B-type helicase, either of which PLE exploits to drive replication. Further, loss of PLE mobilization limits anti-phage activity because of phage-mediated degradation of the bacterial genome. Our work provides insight into the unique challenges facing parasites of lytic phages and underscores the adaptions of satellites to their ever-evolving target phage.

Abstract: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle-wasting disease caused by the lack of dystrophin in muscle fibers that is currently without curative treatment. Mesoangioblasts (MABs) are multipotent progenitor cells that can differentiate to a myogenic lineage and that can be used to express Dystrophin upon transplantation into muscles, in autologous gene therapy approaches. However, their fate in the muscle environment remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the differentiation fate of MABs following their transplantation in DMD murine muscles using a mass cytometry strategy. This allowed the identification and isolation of a fraction of MAB-derived cells presenting common properties with satellite muscle stem cells. This analysis also indicated that most cells did not undergo a myogenic differentiation path once in the muscle environment, limiting their capacity to restore dystrophin expression in transplanted muscles. We therefore assessed whether MAB treatment with cytokines and growth factors prior to engraftment may improve their myogenic fate. We identified a combination of such signals that ameliorates MABs capacity to undergo myogenic differentiation in vivo and to restore dystrophin expression upon engraftment in myopathic murine muscles.

Abstract: Aberrant activation of signalling pathways has been postulated to promote age related changes in skeletal muscle. Cell signalling activation requires not only the expression of ligands and receptors but also an appropriate environment that facilitates their interaction. Here we first examined the expression of SULF1/SULF2 and members of RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) and the Wnt family in skeletal muscle of normal and a mouse model of accelerated ageing. We show that SULF1/SULF2 and these signalling components, a feature of early muscle development are barely detectable in early postnatal muscle. Real time qPCR and immunocytochemical analysis showed gradual but progressive up-regulation of SULF1/SULF2 and RTK/Wnt proteins not only in the activated satellite cells but also on muscle fibres that gradually increased with age. Satellite cells on isolated muscle fibres showed spontaneous in vivo satellite cell activation and progressive reduction in proliferative potential and responsiveness to HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) and dysregulated myogenic differentiation with age. Finally, we show that SULF1/SULF2 and RTK/Wnt signalling components are expressed in progeric mouse muscles at earlier stage but their expression is attenuated by an intervention that promotes muscle repair and growth.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory impairments in its earliest clinical phase. The synaptic loss and dysfunction leading to failures of synaptic networks in AD brain directly cause cognitive deficits of patient. However, it remains unclear whether the synaptic networks in AD brain could be repaired. In this study, we generated functional human induced neural progenitor/stem cells (iNPCs) that had been transplanted into the hippocampus of immunodeficient wild-type and AD mice. The grafted human iNPCs efficiently differentiated into neurons that displayed long-term survival, progressively acquired mature membrane properties, formed graft-host synaptic connections with mouse neurons and functionally integrated into local synaptic circuits, which eventually reinforced and repaired the neural networks of host hippocampus. Consequently, AD mice with human iNPCs exhibited enhanced synaptic plasticity and improved cognitive abilities. Together, our results suggest that restoring synaptic failures by stem cells might provide new directions for the development of novel treatments for human AD.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is a major target for small-molecule antiviral drugs. Antibodies targeting the NA surface antigen could also inhibit virus entry and egress to provide host protection. However, our understanding of the nature and range of target epitopes is limited because of a lack of human antibody structures with influenza neuraminidase. Here, we describe crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of NAs from human-infecting avian H7N9 viruses in complex with five human anti-N9 antibodies, systematically defining several antigenic sites and antibody epitope footprints. These antibodies either fully or partially block the NA active site or bind to epitopes distant from the active site while still showing neuraminidase inhibition. The inhibition of antibodies to NAs was further analyzed by glycan array and solution-based NA activity assays. Together, these structural studies provide insights into protection by anti-NA antibodies and templates for the development of NA-based influenza virus vaccines and therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells are a valuable resource for transplantation, yet our ability to profile xenografts is largely limited to low-throughput immunohistochemical analysis by difficulties in readily isolating grafts for transcriptomic and/or proteomic profiling. Here, we present a simple methodology utilizing differences in the RNA sequence between species to discriminate xenograft from host gene expression (using qPCR or RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]). To demonstrate the approach, we assessed grafts of undifferentiated human stem cells and neural progenitors in the rodent brain. Xenograft-specific qPCR provided sensitive detection of proliferative cells, and identified germ layer markers and appropriate neural maturation genes across the graft types. Xenograft-specific RNA-seq enabled profiling of the complete transcriptome and an unbiased characterization of graft composition. Such xenograft-specific profiling will be crucial for pre-clinical characterization of grafts and batch-testing of therapeutic cell preparations to ensure safety and functional predictability prior to translation.

Abstract: LncRNA plays a vital role in many diseases, and abnormal expression of LncRNA has been reported in many types of tumors. In this study, we analyzed the available public TCGA and GEO databases, and found that the expression of SNHG3 was increased in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which was positively correlated with many clinicopathological parameters, and the higher expression of SNHG3 predicted worse clinical prognosis. Functional experiments indicated that knockdown of SNHG3 could significantly inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of ccRCC in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, through luciferase reporter assays, qPCR and rescue experiments, it was found that SNHG3 could bind to miR-139-5p, thereby up-regulating the expression of its target gene TOP2A, and play a role in promoting tumor progression in ccRCC. The correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the expression of SNHG3 and TOP2A, and both of them were significantly negative correlated with the expression of miR-139-5p. Our work suggested that the SNHG3/miR-139-5p/TOP2A axis plays an important role in the proliferation and metastasis of ccRCC, and was expected to be a new biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis and a target for treatment of ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
Primate lentiviruses encode a Vif protein that counteracts the host antiviral APOBEC3 (A3) family members. The adaptation of Vif to species-specific A3 determinants is a critical event that allowed the spillover of a lentivirus from monkey reservoirs to chimpanzees and subsequently to humans, which gave rise to HIV-1 and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic. How Vif-A3 protein interactions are remodeled during evolution is unclear. Here, we report a 2.94 Å crystal structure of the Vif substrate receptor complex from simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from red-capped mangabey (SIVrcm). The structure of the SIVrcm Vif complex illuminates the stage of lentiviral Vif evolution that is immediately prior to entering hominid primates. Structure-function studies reveal the adaptations that allowed SIVrcm Vif to antagonize hominid A3G. These studies show a partitioning between an evolutionarily dynamic specificity determinant and a conserved protein interacting surface on Vif that enables adaptation while maintaining protein interactions required for potent A3 antagonism.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) is a lifelong marker of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although we previously elucidated the functional importance of ESAM in HSCs in stress-induced hematopoiesis in adults, it is unclear how ESAM affects hematopoietic development during fetal life. To address this issue, we analyzed fetuses from conventional or conditional ESAM-knockout mice. Approximately half of ESAM-null fetuses died after mid-gestation due to anemia. RNA sequencing analyses revealed downregulation of adult-type globins and Alas2, a heme biosynthesis enzyme, in ESAM-null fetal livers. These abnormalities were attributed to malfunction of ESAM-null HSCs, which was demonstrated in culture and transplantation experiments. Although crosslinking ESAM directly influenced gene transcription in HSCs, observations in conditional ESAM-knockout fetuses revealed the critical involvement of ESAM expressed in endothelial cells in fetal lethality. Thus, we showed that ESAM had important roles in developing definitive hematopoiesis. Furthermore, we unveiled the importance of endothelial ESAM in this process.

Abstract: Liver kinase B1 (Lkb1) in dendritic cells (DCs) plays a key role in maintaining immunity homeostasis and adaptive immunity by controlling the CD4+Foxp3+T regulatory cell (CD4+Tregs) pool and T cells activation. However, the function of Lkb1 in DCs for the regulation of CD8+Foxp3+T regulatory cells (CD8+Tregs) has not been addressed. Herein, we found that Lkb1-deficient DCs could lead to excessive CD8+Tregs expansion in multiple organs. We found that OX40 expression was significantly higher in Lkb1-deficient DCs compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting a potential pathway of CD8+Treg expansion. Moreover, we found that CD8+Tregs from mice with conditional deletion Lkb1 in DCs (KO) displayed an activated phenotype and expressed higher levels of specific markers, including ICOS and CD103. Interestingly, compared with the WT mice without lipopolysaccharide(LPS) treatment, we found that CD8+Tregs population increased in the WT mice with LPS treatment which can selectively delete Lkb1 protein in DCs. However, there was no significant difference in CD8+Tregs population in the KO mice between LPS treatment group and non-LPS treatment. Collectively, our findings identified Lkb1 in DCs as a crucial regulator of CD8+Treg expansion.

Abstract: One of the most promising objectives of clinical hematology is to derive engraftable autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Progress in translating iPSC technologies to the clinic relies on the availability of scalable differentiation methodologies. In this study, human iPSCs were differentiated for 21 days using STEMdiff™, a monolayer-based approach for hematopoietic differentiation of human iPSCs that requires no replating, co-culture or embryoid body formation. Both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells were functionally characterized throughout differentiation. In the hematopoietic fraction, an early transient population of primitive CD235a+ erythroid progenitor cells first emerged, followed by hematopoietic progenitors with multilineage differentiation activity in vitro but no long-term engraftment potential in vivo. In later stages of differentiation, a nearly exclusive production of definitive erythroid progenitors was observed. In the non-hematopoietic fraction, we identified a prevalent population of mesenchymal stromal cells and limited arterial vascular endothelium (VE), suggesting that the cellular constitution of the monolayer may be inadequate to support the generation of HSCs with durable repopulating potential. Quantitative modulation of WNT/β-catenin and activin/nodal/TGFβ signaling pathways with CHIR/SB molecules during differentiation enhanced formation of arterial VE, definitive multilineage and erythroid progenitors, but was insufficient to orchestrate the generation of engrafting HSCs. Overall, STEMdiff™ provides a clinically-relevant and readily adaptable platform for the generation of erythroid and multilineage hematopoietic progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Transitioning from a differentiated state to a higher-order of plasticity, by partial rather than full reactivation of pluripotency genes, might be a better approach in regenerative medicine. Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (H2S) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates H2S biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished H2S production associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactic acid. Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of glycolysis with glucose analog, 2-desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of glycolysis inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and glycolysis dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.

Abstract: Interplay between CXCR7 and other CXC receptors, namely CXCR4 or CXCR3, binding such ligands as SDF-1 or ITAC, was shown to regulate multiple cellular processes. The developmental role of signaling pathways mediated by these receptors was proven by the phenotypes of mice lacking either functional CXCR4, or CXCR7, or SDF-1, showing that formation of certain lineages relies on these factors. In this study, using in vitro differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells that lacked the function of CXCR7, we asked the question about the role of CXCR mediated signaling during early steps of differentiation. Our analysis showed that interaction of SDF-1 or ITAC with CXC receptors is necessary for the regulation of crucial developmental regulators expression and that CXCR7 is involved in the control of ESC pluripotency and differentiation into mesodermal lineages.

Abstract: Salisphere-derived adult epithelial cells have been used to improve saliva production of irradiated mouse salivary glands. Importantly, optimization of the cellular composition of salispheres could improve their regenerative capabilities. The Rho Kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y27632, has been used to increase the proliferation and reduce apoptosis of progenitor cells grown in vitro. In this study, we investigated whether Y27632 could be used to improve expansion of adult submandibular salivary epithelial progenitor cells or to affect their differentiation potential in different media contexts. Application of Y27632 in medium used previously to grow salispheres promoted expansion of Kit+ and Mist1+ cells, while in simple serum-containing medium Y27632 increased the number of cells that expressed the K5 basal progenitor marker. Salispheres derived from Mist1CreERT2; R26TdTomato mice grown in salisphere media with Y27632 included Mist1-derived cells. When these salispheres were incorporated into 3D organoids, inclusion of Y27632 in the salisphere stage increased the contribution of Mist1-derived cells expressing the proacinar/acinar marker, Aquaporin 5 (AQP5), in response to FGF2-dependent mesenchymal signals. Optimization of the cellular composition of salispheres and organoids can be used to improve the application of adult salivary progenitor cells in regenerative medicine strategies.

Abstract: Increased oxidative stress is a frequent feature in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). High reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, associated with altered enzyme antioxidant activity, have been reported in dystrophic patients and mdx mice, an experimental model of DMD. In this study, we investigated the effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on oxidative stress marker levels and calcium concentration in primary cultures of dystrophic muscle cells from mdx mice. Primary cultures of skeletal muscle cells from C57BL/10 and mdx mice were treated with coenzyme Q10 (5 μM) for 24 h. The untreated mdx and C57BL/10 muscle cells were used as controls. The MTT and live/dead cell assays showed that CoQ10 presented no cytotoxic effect on normal and dystrophic muscle cells. Intracellular calcium concentration, H2O2 production, 4-HNE, and SOD-2 levels were higher in mdx muscle cells. No significant difference in the catalase, GPx, and Gr levels was found between experimental groups. This study demonstrated that CoQ10 treatment was able to reduce levels of oxidative stress markers, such as H2O2, acting as an antioxidant, as well as decreasing abnormal intracellular calcium influx in dystrophic muscles cells. This study demonstrated that CoQ10 treatment was able to reduce levels of oxidative stress markers, such as H2O2, acting as an antioxidant, as well as decreasing abnormal intracellular calcium influx in dystrophic muscles cells. Our findings also suggest that the decrease of oxidative stress reduces the need for upregulation of antioxidant pathways, such as SOD and GSH.

Abstract: Summary
Dramatic increases in processed food consumption represent a global health threat. Maillard reaction products (MRPs), which are common in processed foods, form upon heat-induced reaction of amino acids with reducing sugars and include advanced glycation end products with deleterious health effects. To examine how processed foods affect the microbiota, we fed gnotobiotic mice, colonized with 54 phylogenetically diverse human gut bacterial strains, defined sugar-rich diets containing whey as the protein source or a matched amino acid mixture. Whey or ϵ-fructoselysine, an MRP in whey and many processed foods, selectively increases Collinsella intestinalis absolute abundance and induces Collinsella expression of genomic loci directing import and metabolism of ϵ-fructoselysine to innocuous products. This locus is repressed by glucose in C. aerofaciens, whose abundance decreases with whey, but is not repressed in C. intestinalis. Identifying gut organisms responding to and degrading potentially harmful processed food components has implications for food science, microbiome science, and public health.

Abstract: Summary
A major limitation in anti-tuberculosis drug screening is the lack of reliable and scalable models for homogeneous human primary macrophage cells of non-cancer origin. Here we report a modified protocol for generating homogeneous populations of macrophage-like cells from human embryonic stem cells. The induced macrophages, referred to as iMACs, presented similar transcriptomic profiles and characteristic immunological features of classical macrophages and were permissive to viral and bacterial infection, in particular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). More importantly, iMAC production was amenable to scale up. To evaluate iMAC efficiency in high-throughput anti-tuberculosis drug screening, we performed a phenotypic screening against intracellular Mtb, involving a library of 3,716 compounds that included FDA-approved drugs and other bioactive compounds. Our primary screen identified 120 hits, which were validated in a secondary screen by dose-intracellular and -extracellular Mtb assays. Our confirmatory studies identified a novel anti-Mtb compound, 10-DEBC, also showing activity against drug-resistant strains.

Abstract: Summary
The microenvironment of developing neurons is a dynamic landscape of both chemical and mechanical cues that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and axon extension. While the regulatory roles of chemical ligands in neuronal morphogenesis have been described, little is known about how mechanical forces influence neurite development. Here, we tested how substratum elasticity regulates neurite development of human forebrain (hFB) neurons and human motor neurons (hMNs), two populations of neurons that naturally extend axons into distinct elastic environments. Using polyacrylamide and collagen hydrogels of varying compliance, we find that hMNs preferred rigid conditions that approximate the elasticity of muscle, whereas hFB neurons preferred softer conditions that approximate brain tissue elasticity. More stable leading-edge protrusions, increased peripheral adhesions, and elevated RHOA signaling of hMN growth cones contributed to faster neurite outgrowth on rigid substrata. Our data suggest that RHOA balances contractile and adhesive forces in response to substratum elasticity.

Abstract: The lipotoxicity is considered as one of the risk for diabetes. Here we report C-type lectin domain family 11, member A (Clec11a) as a new regulator in islet playing a protective role in lipotoxicity induced dysfunction. Islet transcriptome sequencing was performed using the high-fat diet induced obesity (DIO) mice model. We found a significant decrease of Clec11a expression in islets of DIO mice compared to normal control mice, which was further confirmed by real-time PCR. Immunostaining demonstrated the localization of the Clec11a protein in mouse islets. Administration of recombinant human Clec11a (rClec11a) protein promoted the proliferation of islet cells and rescued the inhibition of fatty acid on cell proliferation, which involved the activation of Erk signaling pathway. We also found that the rClec11a altered the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are prone to anoikis after single cell dissociation. The small molecule, Y-27632 is known to increase survival of hESCs and hiPSCs by inhibiting the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we thoroughly screened small molecules to investigate the adhesion and survival of hESCs in adherent culture. Y-27632 provided higher adhesion and survival of hESCs by increased cell migration and preventing cell blebbing in single dissociated cells. The combination of Matrigel with poly-d-lysine increased the attachment and survival of dissociated cells via actin filament and microtubule spreading in Y-27632-treated cells. Although Y-27632 prevented apoptosis by suppressing actin filament contraction, microtubule bundling, and blebbing, prolonged Y-27632 treatment presented a different morphology in the attached growing hESC colony. It induced apoptosis of cells by promoting cytoplasmic spread, E-cadherin structural change, and increased detachment. It also induced actin cytoskeleton disruption, combined with microtubule and intermediate filament elongation. For optimal hPSC culture, our research suggests that Y-27632 should be removed shortly after passaging.

Abstract: Exosomes are present within the local hypoxic tumor microenvironment, where they are able to transfer microRNAs between cells, thereby, effectively mediating cell-cell communication. Hypoxia plays a pivotal role in the progression of many tumor types such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but how hypoxia-induced exosomes in HCC affect HCC cells remains uncertain. In the present study, we found that hypoxic conditions induced increased exosomal production by HCC cells, and these exosomes, in turn, enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in addition to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells under normoxic conditions. When we analyzed these exosomes, we found that miR-1273f were present at higher levels under hypoxic conditions, and we determined that this miRNA was responsible for directly replicating the effects of hypoxic exosomes within HCC cells, in addition to activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We finally identified LHX6, which is a known inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, to be a miR-1273f target. These results, thus, provide evidence that hypoxic conditions can lead HCC cells to express increased exosomes that facilitate miR-1273f expression in normoxic cells, thereby enhancing their malignant phenotype at least in part by targeting LHX6 for downregulation.

Abstract: Spinal cord ischemia is a potential complication of thoracoabdominal aortic surgery that may induce irreversible motor disability. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of simulated microgravity-cultured mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injection following spinal cord ischemia−reperfusion injury. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), normal gravity-cultured MSC (MSC-1 G), and simulated microgravity-cultured MSC (MSC-MG) groups. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by transient balloon occlusion of the thoracic aorta, which was followed immediately by PBS or MSC injection into the left carotid artery. Hindlimb motor function was evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale. Spinal cords were removed 1, 3, or 7 days post-injury for immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. One day post-injury, a few infiltrating inflammatory cells and small vacuoles were observed without significant group differences, followed over several days by progressive spinal cord degeneration. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive (reactive) astrocyte numbers were increased in all three groups, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was colocalized with GFAP-positive cells in spinal ventral horn. Animals in the MSC-MG group demonstrated greater BDNF-positive astrocyte numbers, reduced caspase-3-positive cell numbers, and superior motor recovery. Microgravity-cultured MSC-based therapy may improve functional recovery following spinal ischemia−reperfusion injury by promoting astrocytic BDNF release, thereby preventing apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene are known to cause familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The R406W tau mutation is a unique missense mutation whose patients have been reported to exhibit Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-like phenotypes rather than the more typical FTD phenotypes. In this study, we established patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to investigate the disease pathology induced by the R406W mutation. We generated iPSCs from patients and established isogenic lines using CRISPR/Cas9. The iPSCs were induced into cerebral organoids, which were dissociated into cortical neurons with high purity. In this neuronal culture, the mutant tau protein exhibited reduced phosphorylation levels and was increasingly fragmented by calpain. Furthermore, the mutant tau protein was mislocalized and the axons of the patient-derived neurons displayed morphological and functional abnormalities, which were rescued by microtubule stabilization. The findings of our study provide mechanistic insight into tau pathology and a potential for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) catalyzes the oxidation of H2S to glutathione persulfide with concomitant reduction of CoQ10. We report herein that the promiscuous activity of human SQR supported the conversion of CoA to CoA-SSH (CoA-persulfide), a potent inhibitor of butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, and revealed a molecular link between sulfide and butyrate metabolism, which are known to interact. Three different CoQ1-bound crystal structures furnished insights into how diverse substrates access human SQR, and provided snapshots of the reaction coordinate. Unexpectedly, the active site cysteines in SQR are configured in a bridging trisulfide at the start and end of the catalytic cycle, and the presence of sulfane sulfur was confirmed biochemically. Importantly, our study leads to a mechanistic proposal for human SQR in which sulfide addition to the trisulfide cofactor eliminates 201Cys-SSH, forming an intense charge-transfer complex with flavin adenine dinucleotide, and 379Cys-SSH, which transfers sulfur to an external acceptor.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are objects of interest in regenerative medicine. They are used for various therapies such as for the regeneration of bone, chondrocytes and other tissues. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) inter alia are particularly easy to access, they are relatively abundant in fat tissue. ADSCs could be differentiated into many types of cells. To date, it has been proven that ADSCs only differentiate into mesodermal cell lineages. In this study, we present the differentiation of ADSCs into the corneal epithelium. Human ADSCs were placed in a co-culture with porcine limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs). After 14 days of cultivation, total RNA was extracted for the analysis of the molecular markers (expression of genes of interest). The gene expression was assessed by real-time RT-qPCR. The expression of the surface molecular markers of ADSCs is modulated after co-culturing. We have observed the decrease in CD73, CD90 and CD105 mRNA expression, while the expression of mRNA coding for CK3 and CK12 mRNA was increased in ADSCs co-cultured with porcine limbal epithelial stem cells as compared to the control. We conclude that the co-culture of LESCs and ADSCs changed ADSCs’ molecular markers gene expression indicating initiation of differentiation towards limbal cells.

Abstract: Melatonin, a pleiotropic hormone secreted from the pineal gland, has been shown to exert beneficial effects in muscle regeneration and repair due to its functional diversity, including anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-oxidative activity. However, little is known about the negative role of melatonin in myogenesis. Here, using skeletal muscle cells, we found that melatonin promoted C2C12 cells proliferation and inhibits differentiation both in C2C12 cells and primary myoblasts in mice. Melatonin administration significantly down-regulated differentiation and fusion related genes and inhibited myotube formation both in C2C12 cells and primary myoblasts in mice. RNA-seq showed that melatonin down-regulated essential fusion pore components Myomaker and Myomixer-Myomerger-Minion. Moreover, melatonin suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Inhibition of GSK3β by LiCl rescued the influence of melatonin on differentiation efficiency, Myomaker, but not Myomxier in C2C12 cells. In conclusion, melatonin inhibits myogenic differentiation, Myomaker, and Myomixer through reducing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These data establish a link between melatonin and fusogenic membrane proteins Myomaker and Myomixer, and suggest the new perspective of melatonin in treatment or preventment of muscular diseases.

Abstract: Previously, we demonstrated that species of the Stratiomyidae family exhibit higher tolerance to thermal stress in comparison with that of many representatives of Diptera, including Drosophila species. We hypothesized that species of this group inherited the specific structures of their chaperones from an ancestor of the Stratiomyidae family, and this enabled the descendants to colonize various extreme habitats. To explore this possibility, we cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli copies of the Hsp70 genes from Stratiomys singularior, a typical eurythermal species, and Drosophila melanogaster, for comparison. To investigate the thermal sensitivity of the chaperone function of the inducible 70-kDa heat shock proteins from these species, we used an in vitro refolding luciferase assay. We demonstrated that under conditions of elevated temperature, S. singularior Hsp70 exhibited higher reactivation activity in comparison with D. melanogaster Hsp70 and even human Hsp70. Similarly, S. singularior Hsp70 was significantly more thermostable and showed in vitro refolding activity after preheatment at higher temperatures than D. melanogaster paralog. Thermally induced unfolding experiments using differential scanning calorimetry indicated that Hsp70 from both Diptera species is formed by two domains with different thermal stabilities and that the ATP-binding domain of S. singularior is stable at temperatures 4 degrees higher than that of the D. melanogaster paralog. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report that provides direct experimental data indicating that the evolutionary history of a species may result in adaptive changes in the structures of chaperones to enable them to elicit protective functions at extreme environments.

Abstract: Summary
H7N9 avian influenza virus causes severe infections and might have the potential to trigger a major pandemic. Molecular determinants of human humoral immune response to N9 neuraminidase (NA) proteins, which exhibit unusual features compared with seasonal influenza virus NA proteins, are ill-defined. We isolated 35 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from two H7N9 survivors and two vaccinees. These mAbs react to NA in a subtype-specific manner and recognize diverse antigenic sites on the surface of N9 NA, including epitopes overlapping with, or distinct from, the enzyme active site. Despite recognizing multiple antigenic sites, the mAbs use a common mechanism of action by blocking egress of nascent virions from infected cells, thereby providing an antiviral prophylactic and therapeutic protection in vivo in mice. Studies of breadth, potency, and diversity of antigenic recognition from four subjects suggest that vaccination with inactivated adjuvanted vaccine induce NA-reactive responses comparable to that of H7N9 natural infection.

Abstract: Summary
Following full-thickness skin injuries, epithelialization of the wound is essential. The standard of care to achieve this wound “closure” in patients is autologous split-thickness skin grafting (STSG). However, patients living with STSGs report significant chronic impairments leading to functional deficiencies such as itch, altered sensation, fragility, hypertrophic scarring, and contractures. These features are attributable to the absence of functional dermis combined with the formation of disorganized fibrotic extracellular matrix. Recent work has demonstrated the existence of dermal progenitor cells (DPCs) residing within hair follicles that function to continuously regenerate mesenchymal tissue. The present work examines whether cultured DPCs could regenerate dermis within an STSG and improve overall graft function. Adult human DPCs were transplanted into a full-thickness skin wound in immune-compromised mice and closed with a human STSG. At 3 months, human DPCs (hDPCs) had successfully integrated into the xenograft and differentiated into various regionally specified phenotypes, improving both viscoelastic properties of the graft and mitigating pruritus.

Abstract: Summary
Fecal transfer from healthy donors is being explored as a microbiome modality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to affect the microbiome. Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been shown to have an altered gut microbiome. Here, we unexpectedly found that transfer of feces harvested at peak disease from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS ameliorates disease in recipients in a miRNA-dependent manner. Specifically, we show that miR-30d is enriched in the feces of peak EAE and untreated MS patients. Synthetic miR-30d given orally ameliorates EAE through expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Mechanistically, miR-30d regulates the expression of a lactase in Akkermansia muciniphila, which increases Akkermansia abundance in the gut. The expanded Akkermansia in turn increases Tregs to suppress EAE symptoms. Our findings report the mechanistic underpinnings of a miRNA-microbiome axis and suggest that the feces of diseased subjects might be enriched with miRNAs with therapeutic properties.

Abstract: Endolysins are bacteriophage-derived enzymes that hydrolyze the peptidoglycan of host bacteria. Endolysins are considered to be promising tools for the control of pathogenic bacteria. LysB4 is an endolysin produced by Bacillus cereus-infecting bacteriophage B4, and consists of an N-terminal enzymatic active domain (EAD) and a C-terminal cell wall binding domain (CBD). LysB4 was discovered for the first time as an Lalanoyl-D-glutamate endopeptidase with the ability to breakdown the peptidoglycan among B. cereus-infecting phages. To understand the activity of LysB4 at the molecular level, this study determined the X-ray crystal structure of the LysB4 EAD, using the full-length LysB4 endolysin. The LysB4 EAD has an active site that is typical of LAS-type enzymes, where Zn2+ is tetrahedrally coordinated by three amino acid residues and one water molecule. Mutational studies identified essential residues that are involved in lytic activity. Based on the structural and biochemical information about LysB4, we suggest a ligand-docking model and a putative endopeptidase mechanism for the LysB4 EAD. These suggestions add insight into the molecular mechanism of the endolysin LysB4 in B. cereus-infecting phages.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen exerts extensive and diverse effects throughout the body of women. In addition to the classical nuclear estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER is an important mediator of estrogen action. Existing ER-targeted therapeutic agents act as GPER agonists. Here, we report the identification of a small molecule, named AB-1, with the previously unidentified activity of high selectivity for binding classical ERs over GPER. AB-1 also possesses a unique functional activity profile as an agonist of transcriptional activity but an antagonist of rapid signaling through ERα. Our results define a class of small molecules that discriminate between the classical ERs and GPER, as well as between modes of signaling within the classical ERs. Such an activity profile, if developed into an ER antagonist, could represent an opportunity for the development of first-in-class nuclear hormone receptor-targeted therapeutics for breast cancer exhibiting reduced acquired and de novo resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of brain region-specific progenitors from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is critical for their application. However, transcriptional regulation of neural regionalization in humans is poorly understood. Here, we applied a rostrocaudal patterning system from hESCs to dissect global transcriptional networks controlling early neural regionalization. We found that SOX21 is required for rostral forebrain fate specification. SOX21 knockout led to activation of Wnt signaling, resulting in caudalization of regional identity of rostral forebrain neural progenitor cells. Moreover, we identified WNT8B as a SOX21 direct target. Deletion of WNT8B or inhibition of Wnt signaling in SOX21 knockout neural progenitor cells restored rostral forebrain identity. Furthermore, SOX21 interacted with β-catenin, interfering with the binding of TCF4/β-catenin complex to the WNT8B enhancer. Collectively, these results unveil the unknown role of SOX21 and shed light on how a transcriptional factor modulates early neural regionalization through crosstalk with a key component of Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) perform key cellular activities by controlling the function of bound RNAs. The widely held assumption that RBPs are strictly intracellular has been challenged by the discovery of secreted RBPs. However, extracellular RBPs have been described in eukaryotes, while secreted bacterial RBPs have not been reported. Here, we show that the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes secretes a small RBP that we named Zea. We show that Zea binds a subset of L. monocytogenes RNAs, causing their accumulation in the extracellular medium. Furthermore, during L. monocytogenes infection, Zea binds RIG-I, the non-self-RNA innate immunity sensor, potentiating interferon-β production. Mouse infection studies reveal that Zea affects L. monocytogenes virulence. Together, our results unveil that bacterial RNAs can be present extracellularly in association with RBPs, acting as “social RNAs” to trigger a host response during infection.

Abstract: The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has been extensively researched as a target for treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Investigation of the α7 receptor is commonly performed in animals but it is critical to increase the biologically relevance of the model systems to fully capture the physiological role of the α7 receptor in humans. For example most humans, in contrast to animals, express the hybrid gene CHRFAM7A, the product of which modulates α7 receptor activity. In the present study, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived neurons to establish a humanized α7 model. We established a cryobank of neural stem cells (NSCs) that could reproducibly be matured into neurons expressing neuronal markers and CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A. The neurons responded to NMDA, GABA, and acetylcholine and exhibited synchronized spontaneous calcium oscillations. Gene expression studies and application of a range of α7 positive allosteric modulators (PNU-120595, TQS, JNJ-39393406 and AF58801) together with the α7 agonist PNU-282987 during measurement of intracellular calcium levels demonstrated the presence of functional α7 receptors in matured hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures. Pharmacological α7 activation also resulted in intracellular signaling as measured by ERK 1/2 phosphorylation and c-Fos protein expression. Moreover, PNU-120596 increased the frequency of the spontaneous calcium oscillations demonstrating implication of α7 receptors in human synaptic networks activity. Overall, we show that hiPSC derived neurons are an advanced in vitro model for studying human α7 receptor pharmacology and the involvement of this receptor in cellular processes as intracellular signaling and synaptic transmission.

Abstract: Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase alpha subunit (HADHA) is a key lipid metabolic enzyme with a novel role in carcinogenesis. We previously reported that HADHA, a prognostic marker, was downregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Herein, the tumor inhibitory role of HADHA overexpression in ccRCC was investigated further. The quantitative proteomic analysis displayed that a total of 1293 and 1293 proteins were identified in HADHA overexpressed 786-O-hadha and vector-transfected control 786-O-vc cells, respectively, and 206 proteins were found to be up- or downregulated. PANTHER, OmicsNet, STRING, and DAVID tools were utilized on the dysregulated proteins in order to elucidate multiple metabolic pathways (especial lipid metabolism) and lipid metabolism-related proteins (e.g. ACAT1, ACLY). The dysregulation of the lipid metabolic enzymes, ACAT1, ACLY, CYB5R3 and FASN, were confirmed by Western blotting. Further assays demonstrated that HADHA overexpression significantly inhibited cell growth, induced cell apoptosis, and decreased the formation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs); moreover, it also inhibited tumor growth and lessened the formation of LDs in xenografted mouse. Collectively, these data revealed that HADHA overexpression disrupted lipid metabolism and inhibited tumor growth, which shed light on HADHA as a potential therapeutic target for clinical intervention of ccRCC.

Abstract: Arterial hypertension (HTN) can lead to serious organ damage. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HTN including constitutive activation of platelets, which increases the risk of aggregation and clot formation. We recently demonstrated the plasma membranes of platelets from patients with HTN exhibit modified structural and physicochemical properties; Raman and Fourier transform infrared by attenuated total reflectance (FTIR‐ATR) spectroscopy also indicated lipid content and protein structure alterations. This study aimed to precisely quantify the constituents of the main structural phospholipids and cholesterol in the plasma membranes of platelets from patients with HTN and normotensive individuals. We also assessed the consequence of these alterations on platelet structure and function. Liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry revealed the plasma membranes of HTN platelets contained less cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, more phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine and had similar sphingosine contents. Atomic force microscopy revealed HTN platelets exhibited increased surface roughness and more pleats. Transmission electron microscopy revealed diminution of the internal membranous structures in HTN platelets. Our findings strongly suggest plasma membrane lipid content alterations—including cholesterol depletion—occur in HTN, and these alterations may induce morphological and physiological abnormalities that participate in the functional changes associated with hypertension.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate transitions are essential for specification of stem cells and their niches, but the precise timing and sequence of molecular events during embryonic development are largely unknown. Here, we identify, with 3D and 4D microscopy, unclustered precursors of dermal condensates (DC), signaling niches for epithelial progenitors in hair placodes. With population-based and single-cell transcriptomics, we define a molecular time-lapse from pre-DC fate specification through DC niche formation and establish the developmental trajectory as the DC lineage emerges from fibroblasts. Co-expression of downregulated fibroblast and upregulated DC genes in niche precursors reveals a transitory molecular state following a proliferation shutdown. Waves of transcription factor and signaling molecule expression then coincide with DC formation. Finally, ablation of epidermal Wnt signaling and placode-derived FGF20 demonstrates their requirement for pre-DC specification. These findings uncover a progenitor-dependent niche precursor fate and the transitory molecular events controlling niche formation and function.

Abstract: Summary
A population at low census might go extinct or instead transition into exponential growth to become firmly established. Whether this pivotal event occurs for a within-host pathogen can be the difference between health and illness. Here, we define the principles governing whether HIV-1 spread among cells fails or becomes established by coupling stochastic modeling with laboratory experiments. Following ex vivo activation of latently infected CD4 T cells without de novo infection, stochastic cell division and death contributes to high variability in the magnitude of initial virus release. Transition to exponential HIV-1 spread often fails due to release of an insufficient amount of replication-competent virus. Establishment of exponential growth occurs when virus produced from multiple infected cells exceeds a critical population size. We quantitatively define the crucial transition to exponential viral spread. Thwarting this process would prevent HIV transmission or rebound from the latent reservoir.

Abstract: Summary
Enzymes catalyze fundamental biochemical reactions that control cellular and organismal homeostasis. Here we present an approach for de novo biochemical pathway discovery across entire mammalian enzyme families using parallel viral transduction in mice and untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Applying this method to the M20 peptidases uncovers both known pathways of amino acid metabolism as well as a previously unknown CNDP2-regulated pathway for threonyl dipeptide catabolism. Ablation of CNDP2 in mice elevates threonyl dipeptides across multiple tissues, establishing the physiologic relevance of our biochemical assignments. Taken together, these data underscore the utility of parallel in vivo metabolomics for the family-wide discovery of enzymatic pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive immune systems must accurately distinguish between self and non-self in order to defend against invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmunity. Type III CRISPR-Cas systems employ guide RNA to recognize complementary RNA targets, which triggers the degradation of both the invader’s transcripts and their template DNA. These systems can broadly eliminate foreign targets with multiple mutations but circumvent damage to the host genome. To explore the molecular basis for these features, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the interaction between a type III-A ribonucleoprotein complex and various RNA substrates. We find that Cas10—the DNase effector of the complex—displays rapid conformational fluctuations on foreign RNA targets, but is locked in a static configuration on self RNA. Target mutations differentially modulate Cas10 dynamics and tune the CRISPR interference activity in vivo. These findings highlight the central role of the internal dynamics of CRISPR-Cas complexes in self versus non-self discrimination and target specificity.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction causes various diseases. Mutations in the SLC25A46 gene have been identified in mitochondrial diseases that are sometimes classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2, optic atrophy, and Leigh syndrome. A homolog of SLC25A46 was identified in Drosophila and designated as dSLC25A46 (CG5755). We previously established mitochondrial disease model targeting of dSLC25A46, which causes locomotive dysfunction and morphological defects at neuromuscular junctions, such as reduced synaptic branch lengths and decreased numbers of boutons. The diverse symptoms of mitochondrial diseases carrying mutations in SLC25A46 may be associated with the dysregulation of some epigenetic regulators. To investigate the involvement of epigenetic regulators in mitochondrial diseases, we examined candidate epigenetic regulators that interact with human SLC25A46 by searching Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We discovered that HDAC1 binds to several SLC25A46 genomic regions in human cultured CD4 (+) cells, and attempted to prove this in an in vivo Drosophila model. By demonstrating that Rpd3, Drosophila HDAC1, regulates the histone H4K8 acetylation state in dSLC25A46 genomic regions, we confirmed that Rpd3 is a novel epigenetic regulator modifying the phenotypes observed with the mitochondrial disease model targeting of dSLC25A46. The functional reduction of Rpd3 rescued the deficient locomotive ability and aberrant morphology of motoneurons at presynaptic terminals induced by the dSLC25A46 knockdown. The present results suggest that the inhibition of HDAC1 suppresses the pathogenic processes that lead to the degeneration of motoneurons in mitochondrial diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Type II CRISPR-Cas systems defend prokaryotes from bacteriophage infection through the acquisition of short viral DNA sequences known as spacers, which are transcribed into short RNA guides to specify the targets of the Cas9 nuclease. To counter the potentially devastating propagation of escaper phages with mutations in the target sequences, the host population acquires many different spacers. Whether and how pre-existing spacers in type II systems affect the acquisition of new ones is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that previously acquired spacers promote additional spacer acquisition from the vicinity of the target DNA site cleaved by Cas9. Therefore, CRISPR immune cells acquire additional spacers at the same time as they destroy the infecting virus. This anticipates the rise of escapers or related viruses that could escape targeting by the first spacer acquired. Our results thus reveal Cas9’s role in the generation of immunological memories.

Abstract: Summary
AMPK, a conserved sensor of low cellular energy, can either repress or promote tumor growth depending on the context. However, no studies have examined AMPK function in autochthonous genetic mouse models of epithelial cancer. Here, we examine the role of AMPK in murine KrasG12D-mediated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a cancer type in humans that harbors frequent inactivating mutations in the LKB1 tumor suppressor—the predominant upstream activating kinase of AMPK and 12 related kinases. Unlike LKB1 deletion, AMPK deletion in KrasG12D lung tumors did not accelerate lung tumor growth. Moreover, deletion of AMPK in KrasG12D p53f/f tumors reduced lung tumor burden. We identified a critical role for AMPK in regulating lysosomal gene expression through the Tfe3 transcription factor, which was required to support NSCLC growth. Thus, AMPK supports the growth of KrasG12D-dependent lung cancer through the induction of lysosomes, highlighting an unrecognized liability of NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin subunits are frequently mutated in cancer, but how they function as tumor suppressors is unknown. Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion, but this is not always perturbed in cancer cells. Here, we identify a previously unknown role for cohesin. We find that cohesin is required to repress transcription at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Notably, cohesin represses transcription at DSBs throughout interphase, indicating that this is distinct from its known role in mediating DNA repair through sister chromatid cohesion. We identified a cancer-associated SA2 mutation that supports sister chromatid cohesion but is unable to repress transcription at DSBs. We further show that failure to repress transcription at DSBs leads to large-scale genome rearrangements. Cancer samples lacking SA2 display mutational patterns consistent with loss of this pathway. These findings uncover a new function for cohesin that provides insights into its frequent loss in cancer.

Abstract: Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is an autonomous retrotransposon, which is capable of inserting into a new region of genome. Previous studies have reported that these elements lead to genomic variations and altered functions by affecting gene expression and genetic networks. Mounting evidence strongly indicates that genetic diseases or various cancers can occur as a result of retrotransposition events that involve L1s. Therefore, the development of methodologies to study the structural variations and interpersonal insertion polymorphisms by L1 element-associated changes in an individual genome is invaluable. In this study, we applied a systematic approach to identify human-specific L1s (i.e., L1Hs) through the bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput next-generation sequencing data. We identified 525 candidates that could be inferred to carry non-reference L1Hs in a Korean individual genome (KPGP9). Among them, we randomly selected 40 candidates and validated that approximately 92.5% of non-reference L1Hs were inserted into a KPGP9 genome. In addition, unlike conventional methods, our relatively simple and expedited approach was highly reproducible in confirming the L1 insertions. Taken together, our findings strongly support that the identification of non-reference L1Hs by our novel target enrichment method demonstrates its future application to genomic variation studies on the risk of cancer and genetic disorders.
