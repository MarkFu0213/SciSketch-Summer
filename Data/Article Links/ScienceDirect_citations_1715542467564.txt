Abstract: Summary
DNA replication stress can stall replication forks, leading to genome instability. DNA damage tolerance pathways assist fork progression, promoting replication fork reversal, translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), and repriming. In the absence of the fork remodeler HLTF, forks fail to slow following replication stress, but underlying mechanisms and cellular consequences remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that HLTF-deficient cells fail to undergo fork reversal in vivo and rely on the primase-polymerase PRIMPOL for repriming, unrestrained replication, and S phase progression upon limiting nucleotide levels. By contrast, in an HLTF-HIRAN mutant, unrestrained replication relies on the TLS protein REV1. Importantly, HLTF-deficient cells also exhibit reduced double-strand break (DSB) formation and increased survival upon replication stress. Our findings suggest that HLTF promotes fork remodeling, preventing other mechanisms of replication stress tolerance in cancer cells. This remarkable plasticity of the replication fork may determine the outcome of replication stress in terms of genome integrity, tumorigenesis, and response to chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Extreme weather events can cause heat stress that decreases crop production. Recent studies have demonstrated that protein degradation and rRNA homeostasis as well as transcription factors are involved in the thermoresponse in plants. However, how RNA modifications contribute to temperature stress response in plant remains largely unknown. Herein, we identified OsNSUN2 as an RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methyltransferase in rice. osnsun2 mutant displayed severe temperature- and light-dependent lesion-mimic phenotypes and heat-stress hypersensitivity. Heat stress enhanced the OsNSUN2-dependent m5C modification of mRNAs involved in photosynthesis and detoxification systems, such as β-OsLCY, OsHO2, OsPAL1, and OsGLYI4, which increased protein synthesis. Furthermore, the photosystem of osnsun2 mutant was vulnerable to high ambient temperature and failed to undergo repair under tolerable heat stress. Thus, OsNSUN2 mutation reduced photosynthesis efficiency and accumulated excessive reactive oxygen species upon heat treatment. Our findings demonstrate an important mechanism of mRNA m5C-dependent heat acclimation in rice.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, accumulate along subcerebral projection axons and support neuronal survival during the early postnatal period. It remains unknown how microglia follow an axon-specific distribution pattern to maintain neural circuits. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of microglial accumulation along subcerebral projection axons that were necessary for microglial accumulation in the internal capsule. Screening of molecules involved in this accumulation of microglia to axons of layer V cortical neurons identified netrin-G1, a member of the netrin family of axon guidance molecules with a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. Deletion or knockdown of the netrin-G1 gene Ntng1 reduced microglial accumulation and caused loss of cortical neurons. Netrin-G1 ligand-Ngl1 knockout-mice-derived microglia showed reduced accumulation along the axons compared with wild-type microglia. Thus, microglia accumulate around the subcerebral projection axons via NGL1-netrin-G1 signaling and support neuronal survival. Our observations unveil bidirectional neurotrophic interactions between neurons and microglia.

Abstract: Obesity is a growing threat. In recent years, the finding of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans implemented the studies of anti-obesity therapies based on triggering energy expenditure. The activation of BAT thermogenesis and the recruitment of brite (brown-in-white) adipocytes are under noradrenergic control. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), if centrally administered, enhances thermogenesis through sympathetic activation, but its direct effect on adipocytes is still unclear. The phenotypic change from fat storing to thermogenic adipocytes is recognized by the presence of multilocular lipid droplets (LDs) and fissed mitochondria that tend to surround LDs, maximizing the efficiency of fatty acid release for thermogenesis. BDNF treatment on differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes was compared to negative (CTRL) and positive (norepinephrine, NE) controls. BDNF significantly increased small globular mitochondria percentage (>150% CTRL), while the area surface and elongation index of branched tubules were respectively 55% and 10% lower than NE. Canonical discriminant analysis of mitochondria morphological data clearly separated differentially treated cells with 85% of the total variance. The expression of brown markers and mitochondrial dynamic genes was significantly affected by BDNF. Investigating the pathways involved in adipocyte BDNF stimulation could clarify its role in thermogenesis and its possible local regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanical properties of the actin cortex regulate shape changes during cell division, cell migration, and tissue morphogenesis. We show that modulation of myosin II (MII) filament composition allows tuning of surface tension at the cortex to maintain cell shape during cytokinesis. Our results reveal that MIIA generates cortex tension, while MIIB acts as a stabilizing motor and its inclusion in MII hetero-filaments reduces cortex tension. Tension generation by MIIA drives faster cleavage furrow ingression and bleb formation. We also show distinct roles for the motor and tail domains of MIIB in maintaining cytokinetic fidelity. Maintenance of cortical stability by the motor domain of MIIB safeguards against shape instability-induced chromosome missegregation, while its tail domain mediates cortical localization at the terminal stages of cytokinesis to mediate cell abscission. Because most non-muscle contractile systems are cortical, this tuning mechanism will likely be applicable to numerous processes driven by myosin-II contractility.

Abstract: Summary
Recently developed approaches for highly multiplexed imaging have revealed complex patterns of cellular positioning and cell-cell interactions with important roles in both cellular- and tissue-level physiology. However, tools to quantitatively study cellular patterning and tissue architecture are currently lacking. Here, we develop a spatial analysis toolbox, the histo-cytometric multidimensional analysis pipeline (CytoMAP), which incorporates data clustering, positional correlation, dimensionality reduction, and 2D/3D region reconstruction to identify localized cellular networks and reveal features of tissue organization. We apply CytoMAP to study the microanatomy of innate immune subsets in murine lymph nodes (LNs) and reveal mutually exclusive segregation of migratory dendritic cells (DCs), regionalized compartmentalization of SIRPα− dermal DCs, and preferential association of resident DCs with select LN vasculature. The findings provide insights into the organization of myeloid cells in LNs and demonstrate that CytoMAP is a comprehensive analytics toolbox for revealing features of tissue organization in imaging datasets.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic genomes are almost entirely transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Consequently, the transcription of long noncoding RNAs often overlaps with coding gene promoters, triggering potential gene repression through a poorly characterized mechanism of transcription interference. Here, we propose a comprehensive model of chromatin-based transcription interference in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). By using a noncoding transcription-inducible strain, we analyze the relationship between antisense elongation and coding sense repression, nucleosome occupancy, and transcription-associated histone modifications using near-base pair resolution techniques. We show that antisense noncoding transcription leads to the deacetylation of a subpopulation of −1/+1 nucleosomes associated with increased H3K36me3. Reduced acetylation results in the decreased binding of the RSC chromatin remodeler at −1/+1 nucleosomes and subsequent sliding into the nucleosome-depleted region hindering pre-initiation complex association. Finally, we extend our model by showing that natural antisense noncoding transcription significantly represses ∼20% of S. cerevisiae genes through this chromatin-based transcription interference mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus causes severe hemorrhagic fever, often leading to death in humans. The trimeric fusion glycoprotein (GP) is the sole target for neutralizing antibodies and is the major focus of vaccine development. Soluble GP ectodomains are unstable and mostly monomeric when not fused to a heterologous trimerization domain. Here, we report structure-based designs of Ebola and Marburg GP trimers based on a stabilizing mutation in the hinge loop in refolding region 1 and substitution of a partially buried charge at the interface of the GP1 and GP2 subunits. The combined substitutions (T577P and K588F) substantially increased trimer expression for Ebola GP proteins. We determined the crystal structure of stabilized GP from the Makona Zaire ebolavirus strain without a trimerization domain or complexed ligand. The structure reveals that the stabilized GP adopts the same trimeric prefusion conformation, provides insight into triggering of GP conformational changes, and should inform future filovirus vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression levels vary across developmental stage, cell type, and region in the brain. Genomic variants also contribute to the variation in expression, and some neuropsychiatric disorder loci may exert their effects through this mechanism. To investigate these relationships, we present BrainVar, a unique resource of paired whole-genome and bulk tissue RNA sequencing from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 176 individuals across prenatal and postnatal development. Here we identify common variants that alter gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs]) constantly across development or predominantly during prenatal or postnatal stages. Both “constant” and “temporal-predominant” eQTLs are enriched for loci associated with neuropsychiatric traits and disorders and colocalize with specific variants. Expression levels of more than 12,000 genes rise or fall in a concerted late-fetal transition, with the transitional genes enriched for cell-type-specific genes and neuropsychiatric risk loci, underscoring the importance of cataloging developmental trajectories in understanding cortical physiology and pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) was recently discovered as a cellular restriction factor against replication stress. Here, we show that SLFN11 increases chromatin accessibility genome wide, prominently at active promoters in response to replication stress induced by the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor prexasertib or the topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin. Concomitantly, SLFN11 selectively activates cellular stress response pathways by inducing the transcription of the immediate early genes (IEGs), including JUN, FOS, EGR1, NFKB2, and ATF3, together with the cell cycle arrest genes CDKN1A (p21WAF1) and GADD45. Both chromatin remodeling and IEG activation require the putative ATPase and helicase activity of SLFN11, whereas canonical extrinsic IEG activation is SLFN11 independent. SLFN11-dependent IEG activation by camptothecin is also observed across 55 non-isogenic NCI-60 cell lines. We conclude that SLFN11 acts as a global regulator of chromatin structure and an intrinsic IEG activator with the potential to engage the innate immune activation in response to replicative stress.

Abstract: Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a bioactive lipid in bone, is known as an endogenous ligand for G protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119). Here, we explored the effects of OEA on osteoclast differentiation, function, and survival. While OEA inhibits osteoclast resorptive function by disrupting actin cytoskeleton, it does not affect receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. OEA attenuates osteoclast spreading, blocks actin ring formation, and eventually impairs bone resorption. Mechanistically, OEA inhibits Rac activation in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), but not RANKL. Furthermore, the OEA-mediated cytoskeletal disorganization is abrogated by GPR119 knockdown using small hairpin RNA (shRNA), indicating that GPR119 is pivotal for osteoclast cytoskeletal organization. In addition, OEA induces apoptosis in both control and GPR119 shRNA- transduced osteoclasts, suggesting that GPR119 is not required for osteoclast apoptosis. Collectively, our findings reveal that OEA has inhibitory effects on osteoclast function and survival of mature osteoclasts via GPR119-dependent and GPR119-independent pathways, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional memory of gene expression enables adaptation to repeated stimuli across many organisms. However, the regulation and heritability of transcriptional memory in single cells and through divisions remains poorly understood. Here, we combined microfluidics with single-cell live imaging to monitor Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase 1 (GAL1) expression over multiple generations. By applying pedigree analysis, we dissected and quantified the maintenance and inheritance of transcriptional reinduction memory in individual cells through multiple divisions. We systematically screened for loss- and gain-of-memory knockouts to identify memory regulators in thousands of single cells. We identified new loss-of-memory mutants, which affect memory inheritance into progeny. We also unveiled a gain-of-memory mutant, elp6Δ, and suggest that this new phenotype can be mediated through decreased histone occupancy at the GAL1 promoter. Our work uncovers principles of maintenance and inheritance of gene expression states and their regulators at the single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
The flat bones of the skull are densely innervated during development, but little is known regarding their role during repair. We describe a neurotrophic mechanism that directs sensory nerve transit in the mouse calvaria. Patent cranial suture mesenchyme represents an NGF (nerve growth factor)-rich domain, in which sensory nerves transit. Experimental calvarial injury upregulates Ngf in an IL-1β/TNF-α-rich defect niche, with consequent axonal ingrowth. In calvarial osteoblasts, IL-1β and TNF-α stimulate Ngf and downstream NF-κB signaling. Locoregional deletion of Ngf delays defect site re-innervation and blunted repair. Genetic disruption of Ngf among LysM-expressing macrophages phenocopies these observations, whereas conditional knockout of Ngf among Pdgfra-expressing cells does not. Finally, inhibition of TrkA catalytic activity similarly delays re-innervation and repair. These results demonstrate an essential role of NGF-TrkA signaling in bone healing and implicate macrophage-derived NGF-induced ingrowth of skeletal sensory nerves as an important mediator of this repair.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) contributes to behavioral inhibition and compulsions, but circuit mechanisms are unclear. Recent evidence suggests that amygdala and thalamic inputs exert opposing control over behavior, much like direct and indirect pathway output neurons. Accordingly, opponent processes between these NAc inputs or cell types may underlie efficient reward seeking. We assess the contributions of these circuit elements to mouse operant behavior during recurring conditions when reward is and is not available. Although direct pathway stimulation is rewarding and indirect pathway stimulation aversive, the activity of both cell types is elevated during periods of behavioral suppression, and the inhibition of either cell-type selectively increases unproductive reward seeking. Amygdala and thalamic inputs are also necessary for behavioral suppression, even though they both support self-stimulation and innervate different NAc subregions. These data suggest that efficient reward seeking relies on complementary activity across NAc cell types and inputs rather than opponent processes between them.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidized lipids play a critical role in a variety of diseases with two faces: pro- and anti-inflammatory. The molecular mechanisms of this Janus-faced activity remain largely unknown. Here, we have identified that cyclopentenone-containing prostaglandins such as 15d-PGJ2 and structurally related oxidized phospholipid species possess a dual and opposing bioactivity in inflammation, depending on their concentration. Exposure of dendritic cells (DCs)/macrophages to low concentrations of such lipids before Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation instigates an anti-inflammatory response mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation and downstream targets. By contrast, high concentrations of such lipids upon TLR activation of DCs/macrophages result in inflammatory apoptosis characterized by mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-8-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β maturation independently of Nrf2 and the classical inflammasome pathway. These results uncover unexpected pro- and anti-inflammatory activities of physiologically relevant lipid species generated by enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation dependent on their concentration, a phenomenon known as hormesis.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T lymphocytes are crucial for controlling a range of innate and adaptive immune effectors. For CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, CD4+ T cells can function as helpers (TH) to amplify magnitude and functionality or as regulatory cells (Treg) capable of profound inhibition. It is unclear what determines differentiation to these phenotypes and whether pathogens provoke alternate programs. We find that, depending on the size of initial dose, Listeria infection drives CD4+ T cells to act as TH or induces rapid polyclonal conversion to immunosuppressive Treg. Conversion to Treg depends on the TLR9 and IL-12 pathways elicited by CD8α+ dendritic cell (DC) sensing of danger-associated neutrophil self-DNA. These findings resolve long-standing questions regarding the conditional requirement for TH amongst pathogens and reveal a remarkable degree of plasticity in the function of CD4+ T cells, which can be quickly converted to Treg in vivo by infection-mediated immune modulation.

Molecular Signatures of Sinus Node Dysfunction Induce Structural Remodeling in the Right Atrial Tissue,

Abstract: The sinus node (SN) is located at the apex of the cardiac conduction system, and SN dysfunction (SND)—characterized by electrical remodeling—is generally attributed to idiopathic fibrosis or ischemic injuries in the SN. SND is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, including syncope, heart failure, and atrial arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. One of the histological SND hallmarks is degenerative atrial remodeling that is associated with conduction abnormalities and increased right atrial refractoriness. Although SND is frequently accompanied by increased fibrosis in the right atrium (RA), its molecular basis still remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated whether SND can induce significant molecular changes that account for the structural remodeling of RA. Towards this, we employed a rabbit model of experimental SND, and then compared the genome-wide RNA expression profiles in RA between SND-induced rabbits and sham-operated controls to identify the differentially expressed transcripts. The accompanying gene enrichment analysis revealed extensive pro-fibrotic changes within 7 days after the SN ablation, including activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and alterations in the levels of extracellular matrix components and their regulators. Importantly, our findings suggest that periostin, a matricellular factor that regulates the development of cardiac tissue, might play a key role in mediating TGF-β-signaling-induced aberrant atrial remodeling. In conclusion, the present study provides valuable information regarding the molecular signatures underlying SND-induced atrial remodeling, and indicates that periostin can be potentially used in the diagnosis of fibroproliferative cardiac dysfunctions.

Abstract: Summary
Information flow through neural circuits often requires their organization into topographic maps in which the positions of cell bodies and synaptic targets correspond. To understand how topographic map development is controlled, we examine the mechanism underlying targeting of vagus motor axons to the pharyngeal arches in zebrafish. We reveal that retinoic acid organizes topography by specifying anterior-posterior identity in vagus motor neurons. We then show that chemoattractant signaling between Hgf and Met is required for vagus innervation of the pharyngeal arches. Finally, we find that retinoic acid controls the spatiotemporal dynamics of Hgf/Met signaling to coordinate axon targeting with the developmental progression of the pharyngeal arches and show that experimentally altering the timing of Hgf/Met signaling is sufficient to redirect axon targeting and disrupt the topographic map. These findings establish a mechanism of topographic map development in which the regulation of chemoattractant signaling in space and time guides axon targeting.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies targeting the V1V2 apex of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer comprise one of the most commonly elicited categories of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Structures of these antibodies indicate diverse modes of Env recognition typified by antibodies of the PG9 class and the PGT145 class. The mode of recognition, however, has been unclear for the most potent of the V1V2 apex-targeting antibodies, CAP256-VRC26.25 (named for donor-lineage.clone and referred to hereafter as VRC26.25). Here, we determine the cryoelectron microscopy structure at 3.7 Å resolution of the antigen-binding fragment of VRC26.25 in complex with the Env trimer thought to have initiated the lineage. The 36-residue protruding loop of VRC26.25 displays recognition incorporating both strand-C interactions similar to the PG9 class and V1V2 apex insertion similar to the PGT145 class. Structural elements of separate antibody classes can thus intermingle to form a “combined” class, which in this case yields an antibody of extraordinary potency.

Abstract: Construction of scaffolds which are similar to natural niches regarding both biochemical composition and mechanical characteristics has gained great attention in the field of tissue engineering. However, application of natural polymers, such as hyaluronic acid, is challenging in construction of scaffolds due to physicochemical properties, difficult to use in electrospinning and low cell adhesion rate. In this study, HA was acetylated to make it soluble in high polarity solvent and blended with PCL for construction of nanofibrous composite (ac-HA/PCL) scaffolds. Chondroinductivity of the constructed scaffolds was investigated using human mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs). The presence of acetyl groups, as well as morphology and biocompatibility of the composite scaffolds were characterized by HNMR, FTIR, SEM and MTT assay respectively. Expression of cartilage-specific genes (SOX9, Col II and Aggrecan) was monitored by Real-time PCR. Significant increase in expression of Sox9 and Col II as the markers of chondrogenic differentiation as well as the results of Alcian blue staining, indicated the chondro-inductive potential of HA/PCL nanofibrous scaffolds. Acetylated HA was biocompatible with chondroinductivity features, therefore it not only had the positive characteristics of natural HA, but also enhanced the cellular attachment and application potential.

Abstract: Summary
Opposing sources of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Nodal signaling molecules are sufficient to induce the formation of a full axis in zebrafish embryos. To address how these signals orchestrate patterning, we transplant sources of fluorescently tagged Nodal and BMP into zebrafish embryos, robustly inducing the formation of secondary axes. Nodal and BMP signal non-cell-autonomously and form similar protein gradients in this context, but the signaling range of Nodal (pSmad2) is shorter than the BMP range (pSmad5). This yields a localized region of pSmad2 activity around the Nodal source, overlapping with a broad domain of pSmad5 activity across the embryo. Cell fates induced in various regions stereotypically correlate with pSmad2-to-pSmad5 ratios and can even be induced BMP- and Nodal-independently with different ratios of constitutively active Smad2 and Smad5. Strikingly, we find that Smad2 and Smad5 antagonize each other for specific cell fates, providing a mechanism for how cells integrate and discriminate between overlapping signals during development.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a critical component of host innate immune defense but can contribute to chronic autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease. Once activated, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway induces both type I interferon (IFN) expression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated cytokine production. Currently, these two signaling arms are thought to be mediated by a single upstream kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that TBK1 alone is dispensable for STING-induced NF-κB responses in human and mouse immune cells, as well as in vivo. We further demonstrate that TBK1 acts redundantly with IκB kinase ε (IKKε) to drive NF-κB upon STING activation. Interestingly, we show that activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is highly dependent on TBK1 kinase activity, whereas NF-κB is significantly less sensitive to TBK1/IKKε kinase inhibition. Our work redefines signaling events downstream of cGAS-STING. Our findings further suggest that cGAS-STING will need to be targeted directly to effectively ameliorate the inflammation underpinning disorders associated with STING hyperactivity.

Abstract: Summary
Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling determines mesenchymal-stromal-cell (MSC) osteolineage commitment and tissue identity. However, molecular integration of developmental signaling with MSC-intrinsic chromatin regulation remains incompletely understood. SWI/SNF-(BAF) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler implicated in multi-cellular development. We show that BMPs and long-term osteogenic signals in MSCs selectively induce expression of polybromo BAF (PBAF) components Pbrm1, Arid2, and Brd7. Loss of Pbrm1/Arid2/Brd7 profoundly impairs osteolineage gene expression and osteogenesis without compromising adipogenesis. Pbrm1 loss attenuates MSC in vivo ossification. Mechanistically, Pbrm1/PBAF deficiency impairs Smad1/5/8 activation through locus-specific epi-genomic remodeling, involving Pbrm1 bromodomains, along with transcriptional downregulation of Bmpr/TgfβrII affecting BMP-early-responsive gene expression. Gain of function of BmprIβ, TgfβrII in PBAF-deficient MSCs partly restores Smad1/5/8 activation and osteogenesis. Pbrm1 loss further affects hematopoietic stem and progenitor activity through non-cell-autonomous regulation of microenvironment and niche-factor expression. Together, these findings reveal a link illustrating epi-genomic feedforward control of BMP/TGF-β signaling to transcriptional and cellular plasticity in the mesenchymal microenvironment and account for stromal-SWI/SNF in hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Genome stability requires coordination of DNA replication origin activation and replication fork progression. RTEL1 is a regulator of homologous recombination (HR) implicated in meiotic cross-over control and DNA repair in C. elegans. Through a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen, we uncovered an essential genetic interaction between RTEL1 and DNA polymerase (Pol) epsilon. Loss of POLE4, an accessory subunit of Pol epsilon, has no overt phenotype in worms. In contrast, the combined loss of POLE-4 and RTEL-1 results in embryonic lethality, accumulation of HR intermediates, genome instability, and cessation of DNA replication. Similarly, loss of Rtel1 in Pole4−/− mouse cells inhibits cellular proliferation, which is associated with persistent HR intermediates and incomplete DNA replication. We propose that RTEL1 facilitates genome-wide fork progression through its ability to metabolize DNA secondary structures that form during DNA replication. Loss of this function becomes incompatible with cell survival under conditions of reduced origin activation, such as Pol epsilon hypomorphy.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons require proper polarization for precise positioning and axon-dendrite formation. Their intrinsic regulators and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that Wdr47 is a key polarization regulator. Wdr47-deficient newborn mice die of suffocation due to central nervous system defects including axonal tracts agenesis and slowed radial migration. Wdr47 deficiency represses the multipolar-bipolar transition of cortical neurons, reduces neurite tip-directed microtubule dynamics, and causes multi-axon formation. Overexpression of Wdr47 in wild-type neurons inhibits axon specification and neutralizes Taxol-induced neurite overgrowth and axon overproduction. Wdr47 interacts with the Camsap family of microtubule minus-end-binding proteins; associates with microtubules through Camsap3, whose gene disruption also causes multi-axons; and promotes Camsap3 accumulation in neurites of unpolarized neurons. Furthermore, Camsap overexpression rescues the polarization defects of Wdr47-deficient neurons. Our results indicate that Wdr47 facilitates proper neurite remodeling through Camsaps to fine-tune regional microtubule dynamics and organization during early stages of neuronal polarization.

Abstract: Summary
The amyloid-like aggregation propensity present in most globular proteins is generally considered to be a secondary side effect resulting from the requirements of protein stability. Here, we demonstrate, however, that mutations in the globular and amyloid state are thermodynamically correlated rather than simply associated. In addition, we show that the standard genetic code couples this structural correlation into a tight evolutionary relationship. We illustrate the extent of this evolutionary entanglement of amyloid propensity and globular protein stability. Suppressing a 600-Ma-conserved amyloidogenic segment in the p53 core domain fold is structurally feasible but requires 7-bp substitutions to concomitantly introduce two aggregation-suppressing and three stabilizing amino acid mutations. We speculate that, rather than being a corollary of protein evolution, it is equally plausible that positive selection for amyloid structure could have been a driver for the emergence of globular protein structure.

Abstract: Summary
BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling activity is precisely controlled by both pathway agonists and antagonists. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized BMP signaling antagonist. We demonstrate that the Drosophila BMP type I receptor Sax (Saxophone) functions as a Dpp (Decapentaplegic) receptor in Drosophila embryos, but that its activity is normally inhibited by the O-linked glycosyltransferase Sxc (Super sex combs). In wild-type embryos, Sax activity is inhibited, and the BMP type I receptor Tkv (Thickveins) is the sole conduit for Dpp. In contrast, in sxc mutants, the Dpp signal is transduced by both Tkv and Sax, and elevated Dpp signaling results in embryonic lethality. We also demonstrate that Sxc O-glycosylates Sax and observe elevated Dpp signaling in response to maternal restriction of dietary sugar. These findings link fertility to nutritive environment and point to Sax signaling as the nutrient-sensitive branch of BMP signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Codon pair deoptimization is an efficient virus attenuation strategy, but the mechanism that leads to attenuation is unknown. The strategy involves synthetic recoding of viral genomes that alters the positions of synonymous codons, thereby increasing the number of suboptimal codon pairs and CpG dinucleotides in recoded genomes. Here we identify the molecular mechanism of codon pair deoptimization-based attenuation by studying recoded influenza A viruses. We show that suboptimal codon pairs cause attenuation, whereas the increase of CpG dinucleotides has no effect. Furthermore, we show that suboptimal codon pairs reduce both mRNA stability and translation efficiency of codon pair-deoptimized genes. Consequently, reduced protein production directly causes virus attenuation. Our study provides evidence that suboptimal codon pairs are major determinants of mRNA stability. Additionally, it demonstrates that codon pair bias can be used to increase mRNA stability and protein production of synthetic genes in many areas of biotechnology.

Abstract: Summary
Epilepsy, intellectual and cortical sensory deficits, and psychiatric manifestations are the most frequent manifestations of mitochondrial diseases. How mitochondrial dysfunction affects neural structure and function remains elusive, mostly because of a lack of proper in vitro neuronal model systems with mitochondrial dysfunction. Leveraging induced pluripotent stem cell technology, we differentiated excitatory cortical neurons (iNeurons) with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function on an isogenic nuclear DNA background from patients with the common pathogenic m.3243A > G variant of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). iNeurons with high heteroplasmy exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, delayed neural maturation, reduced dendritic complexity, and fewer excitatory synapses. Micro-electrode array recordings of neuronal networks displayed reduced network activity and decreased synchronous network bursting. Impaired neuronal energy metabolism and compromised structural and functional integrity of neurons and neural networks could be the primary drivers of increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric manifestations of mitochondrial disease.

Abstract: Summary
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness. However, the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms underlying ROP remain elusive. Herein, using the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model of ROP, we demonstrate that disassembly of photoreceptor connecting cilia is an early event in response to oxygen changes. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is upregulated in the retina of OIR mice and accumulates in the transition zone of connecting cilia. We also show that in response to oxygen changes, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is activated and phosphorylates HDAC6, blocking its ubiquitination by von Hippel-Lindau and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Moreover, depletion of HDAC6 or inhibition of the ASK1/HDAC6 axis protects mice from oxygen-change-induced pathological changes of photoreceptors. These findings reveal a critical role for ASK1/HDAC6-mediated connecting cilium disassembly in the OIR mouse model of ROP and suggest a potential value of ASK1/HDAC6-targeted agents for prevention of this disease.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a pivotal role in gene expression by modulating the stability of transcripts. However, the identification of degradation target mRNAs of RBPs remains difficult. By the combined analysis of transcriptome-wide mRNA stabilities and the binding of mRNAs to human Pumilio 1 (PUM1), we identify 48 mRNAs that both bind to PUM1 and exhibit PUM1-dependent degradation. Analysis of changes in the abundance of PUM1 and its degradation target mRNAs in RNA-seq data indicate that DNA-damaging agents negatively regulate PUM1-mediated mRNA decay. Cells exposed to cisplatin have reduced PUM1 abundance and increased PCNA and UBE2A mRNAs encoding proteins involved in DNA damage tolerance by translesion synthesis (TLS). Cells overexpressing PUM1 exhibit impaired DNA synthesis and TLS and increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin. Thus, our method identifies target mRNAs of PUM1-mediated decay and reveals that cells respond to DNA damage by inhibiting PUM1-mediated mRNA decay to activate TLS.

Abstract: Summary
Terminal selectors are transcription factors that control the morphological, physiological, and molecular features that characterize distinct cell types. Here, we show that, in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, NvPOU4 is expressed in post-mitotic cells that give rise to a diverse set of neural cell types, including cnidocytes and NvElav1-expressing neurons. Morphological analyses of NvPOU4 mutants crossed to transgenic reporter lines show that the loss of NvPOU4 does not affect the initial specification of neural cells. Transcriptomes derived from the mutants and from different neural cell populations reveal that NvPOU4 is required for the execution of the terminal differentiation program of these neural cells. These findings suggest that POU4 genes have ancient functions as terminal selectors for morphologically and functionally disparate types of neurons and they provide experimental support for the relevance of terminal selectors for understanding the evolution of cell types.

Abstract: Our previous study revealed a novel role of Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) in islet development and insulin secretion. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease that selectively degrades biologically important substrates associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The current study was designed to investigate the effect of FADD phosphorylation on IDE. We found that the mRNA and protein levels of IDE were significantly downregulated in FADD-D mouse livers compared with control mice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that FADD regulates the expression of IDE at the transcriptional level without affecting the stability of the mRNA in HepG2 cells. Following treatment with cycloheximide, the IDE protein degradation rate was found to be increased in both FADD-D primary hepatocytes and FADD-knockdown HepG2 cells. Additionally, IDE expression levels were reduced in insulin-stimulated primary hepatocytes from FADD-D mice compared to those from control mice. Moreover, FADD phosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation of FoxO1, thus inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the IDE promoter. Together, these findings imply a novel role of FADD in the reduction of protein stability and expression levels of IDE.

Abstract: Summary
A distinctive feature of neocortical development is the highly coordinated production of different progenitor cell subtypes, which are critical for ensuring adequate neurogenic outcome and the development of normal neocortical size. To further understand the mechanisms that underlie neocortical growth, we focused our studies on the microcephaly gene Mcph1, and we report here that Mcph1 (1) exerts its functions in rapidly dividing apical radial glial cells (aRGCs) during mouse neocortical development stages that precede indirect neurogenesis; (2) is expressed at mitochondria; and (3) controls the proper proliferation and survival of RGCs, potentially through crosstalk with cellular metabolic pathways involving the stimulation of mitochondrial activity via VDAC1/GRP75 and AKT/HK2/VDAC1 and glutaminolysis via ATF4/PCK2. We currently report the description of a MCPH-gene implication in the interplay between bioenergetic pathways and neocortical growth, thus pointing to alterations of cellular metabolic pathways, in particular glutaminolysis, as a possible cause of microcephalic pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) promote atherosclerosis by inducing proinflammatory cytokines, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. NET DNA is immunogenic, but given the cytotoxicity of NET histones, it is unclear how it activates cells without killing them. Here, we show that histones, DNA, citrullination, and fragmentation synergize to drive inflammation below the histone cytotoxicity threshold. At low concentrations, nucleosomes induce cytokines, but high concentrations kill cells before cytokines are produced. The synergy between histones and DNA is critical for sub-lethal signaling and relies on distinct roles for histones and DNA. Histones bind and activate TLR4, whereas DNA recruits TLR4 to histone-containing endosomes. Citrullination is dispensable for NETosis but potentiates histone-mediated signaling. Consistently, chromatin blockade or PAD4 deficiency reduces atherosclerosis. Inflammation is also reduced in infected mice expressing GFP-tagged histones that block TLR4 binding. Thus, chromatin promotes inflammation in sterile disease and infection via synergistic mechanisms that use signals with distinct functions.

Abstract: Summary
Disrupted sleep-wake and molecular circadian rhythms are a feature of aging associated with metabolic disease and reduced levels of NAD+, yet whether changes in nucleotide metabolism control circadian behavioral and genomic rhythms remains unknown. Here, we reveal that supplementation with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) markedly reprograms metabolic and stress-response pathways that decline with aging through inhibition of the clock repressor PER2. NR enhances BMAL1 chromatin binding genome-wide through PER2K680 deacetylation, which in turn primes PER2 phosphorylation within a domain that controls nuclear transport and stability and that is mutated in human advanced sleep phase syndrome. In old mice, dampened BMAL1 chromatin binding, transcriptional oscillations, mitochondrial respiration rhythms, and late evening activity are restored by NAD+ repletion to youthful levels with NR. These results reveal effects of NAD+ on metabolism and the circadian system with aging through the spatiotemporal control of the molecular clock.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the role of the extensive senescence-associated 3D genome reorganization, we generated genome-wide chromatin interaction maps, epigenome, replication-timing, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and gene expression profiles from cells entering replicative senescence (RS) or upon oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). We identify senescence-associated heterochromatin domains (SAHDs). Differential intra- versus inter-SAHD interactions lead to the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs) in OIS but not in RS. This OIS-specific configuration brings active genes located in genomic regions adjacent to SAHDs in close spatial proximity and favors their expression. We also identify DNMT1 as a factor that induces SAHFs by promoting HMGA2 expression. Upon DNMT1 depletion, OIS cells transition to a 3D genome conformation akin to that of cells in replicative senescence. These data show how multi-omics and imaging can identify critical features of RS and OIS and discover determinants of acute senescence and SAHF formation.

Abstract: Summary
Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a cancer therapeutic target in ongoing clinical trials disrupting primarily BRD4-regulated transcription programs. The role of BRD4 in cancer has been attributed mainly to the abundant long isoform (BRD4-L). Here we show, by isoform-specific knockdown and endogenous protein detection, along with transgene expression, the less abundant BRD4 short isoform (BRD4-S) is oncogenic while BRD4-L is tumor-suppressive in breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, as well as mammary tumor formation and metastasis. Through integrated RNA-seq, genome-wide ChIP-seq, and CUT&RUN association profiling, we identify the Engrailed-1 (EN1) homeobox transcription factor as a key BRD4-S coregulator, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer. BRD4-S and EN1 comodulate the extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated matrisome network, including type II cystatin gene cluster, mucin 5, and cathepsin loci, via enhancer regulation of cancer-associated genes and pathways. Our work highlights the importance of targeted therapies for the oncogenic, but not tumor-suppressive, activity of BRD4.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) cultures are increasingly popular as an in vitro tumor model for drug screening because they can mimic the complexity and heterogeneity of tumors compared to 2D monolayer cell cultures. The oncogenic microRNA, miR-21−5p (hereafter denoted as miR-21), is one of the most upregulated miRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC). Herein, we established a stable miR-21-overexpressing clone in the DLD-1 human CRC cell line to investigate its impact on MCTS formation. We found that miR-21 overexpression enhanced cell-cell interactions/aggregations in both 2D monolayer and 3D suspension cultures. Cell aggregates in 3D suspension culture further formed MCTSs in miR-21-overexpressing cells. miR-21 overexpression was associated with the upregulation of proteins involved in E-cadherin-associated cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, miR-21 induction of MCTSs could be reversed by the antibody-induced blockade of E-cadherin. Our results showed that miR-21 overexpression promoted MCTS formation through enhancing E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell interactions, which represents an advance in vitro model for investigating CRC biology.

Abstract: Summary
Aging-associated functional decline is accompanied by alterations in the epigenome. To explore DNA modifications that could influence visual function with age, we perform whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of purified mouse rod photoreceptors at four ages and identify 2,054 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We detect many DMRs during early stages of aging and in rod regulatory regions, and some of these cluster at chromosomal hotspots, especially on chromosome 10, which includes a longevity interactome. Integration of methylome to age-related transcriptome changes, chromatin signatures, and first-order protein-protein interactions uncover an enrichment of DMRs in altered pathways that are associated with rod function, aging, and energy metabolism. In concordance, we detect reduced basal mitochondrial respiration and increased fatty acid dependency with retinal age in ex vivo assays. Our study reveals age-dependent genomic and chromatin features susceptible to DNA methylation changes in rod photoreceptors and identifies a link between DNA methylation and energy metabolism in aging.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is especially pathogenic, often being associated with intractable pneumonia and high mortality. How P. aeruginosa avoids immune clearance and persists in the inflamed human airway remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that P. aeruginosa can exploit the host immune response to maintain infection. Notably, unlike other opportunistic bacteria, we found that P. aeruginosa alters its metabolic and immunostimulatory properties in response to itaconate, an abundant host-derived immunometabolite in the infected lung. Itaconate induces bacterial membrane stress, resulting in downregulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and upregulation of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). These itaconate-adapted P. aeruginosa accumulate lptD mutations, which favor itaconate assimilation and biofilm formation. EPS, in turn, induces itaconate production by myeloid cells, both in the airway and systemically, skewing the host immune response to one permissive of chronic infection. Thus, the metabolic versatility of P. aeruginosa needs to be taken into account when designing therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Skin aging is accompanied by hair loss due to impairments in hair follicle (HF) epithelial progenitor cells and their mesenchymal niche. This inductive mesenchyme, called dermal papilla (DP), undergoes progressive cell loss and eventual miniaturization that contributes to HF pathogenesis. Using laser ablation and fate mapping, we show that HF dermal stem cells (hfDSCs) reconstitute the damaged DP and maintain hair growth, suggesting that hfDSC dysfunction may trigger degeneration of the inductive niche. Fate mapping over 24 months revealed progressive hfDSC depletion, and in vivo clonal analysis of aged hfDSCs showed impaired self-renewal and biased differentiation. Single-cell RNA-seq confirmed hfDSCs as a central precursor, giving rise to divergent mesenchymal trajectories. In aged skin, hfDSCs exhibited senescent-like characteristics, and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes were identified in the aging HF mesenchyme. These results clarify fibroblast dynamics within the HF and suggest that progressive dysfunction within the mesenchymal progenitor pool contributes to age-related hair loss.

Abstract: Summary
Olfactory neurons allow animals to discriminate nutritious food sources from potential pathogens. From a forward genetic screen, we uncovered a surprising requirement for the olfactory neuron gene olrn-1 in the regulation of intestinal epithelial immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans. During nematode development, olrn-1 is required to program the expression of odorant receptors in the AWC olfactory neuron pair. Here, we show that olrn-1 also functions in AWC neurons in the cell non-autonomous suppression of the canonical p38 MAPK PMK-1 immune pathway in the intestine. Low activity of OLRN-1, which activates the p38 MAPK signaling cassette in AWC neurons during larval development, also de-represses the p38 MAPK PMK-1 pathway in the intestine to promote immune effector transcription, increased clearance of an intestinal pathogen, and resistance to bacterial infection. These data reveal an unexpected connection between olfactory receptor development and innate immunity and show that anti-pathogen defenses in the intestine are developmentally programmed.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common life-threatening malignancies and the top cause of cancer deaths in women. Although many conventional therapies exist for its treatment, breast cancer still has many handicaps to overcome. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a well-known cause of tumor recurrences due to the ability of CSCs for self-renewal and differentiation into cell subpopulations, similar to stem cells. To fully treat breast cancer, a strategy for the treatment of both cancer cells and CSCs is required. However, current strategies for the eradication of CSCs are non-specific and have low efficacy. Therefore, surface biomarkers to selectively treat CSCs need to be developed. Here, 34 out of 641 surface biomarkers on CSCs were identified by proteomic analysis between the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 and MCF-7-derived CSCs. Among them, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules 6 (CEACAM6 or CD66c), a member of the CEA family, was selected as a novel biomarker on the CSC surface. This biomarker was then experimentally validated and evaluated for use as a CSC-specific marker. Its biological effects were assessed by treating breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) with short hairpin (sh)-RNA under oxidative cellular conditions. This study is the first to evaluate the biological function of CD66c as a novel biomarker on the surface of CSCs. This marker is available as a moiety for use in the development of targeted therapeutic agents against CSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Gap junction channels (GJCs) mediate intercellular communication and are gated by numerous conditions such as pH. The electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Cx26 GJC at physiological pH recapitulates previous GJC structures in lipid bilayers. At pH 6.4, we identify two conformational states, one resembling the open physiological-pH structure and a closed conformation that displays six threads of density, that join to form a pore-occluding density. Crosslinking and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveal closer association between the N-terminal (NT) domains and the cytoplasmic loops (CL) at acidic pH. Previous electrophysiologic studies suggest an association between NT residue N14 and H100 near M2, which may trigger the observed movement of M2 toward M1 in our cryo-EM maps, thereby accounting for additional NT-CL crosslinks at acidic pH. We propose that these pH-induced interactions and conformational changes result in extension, ordering, and association of the acetylated NT domains to form a hexameric “ball-and-chain” gating particle.

Abstract: Summary
Digit loss/reductions are evolutionary adaptations in cursorial mammals such as pigs. To gain mechanistic insight into these processes, we performed a comparative molecular analysis of limb development in mouse and pig embryos, which revealed a loss of anterior-posterior polarity during distal progression of pig limb bud development. These alterations in pig limb buds are paralleled by changes in the mesenchymal response to Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, which is altered upstream of the reduction and loss of Fgf8 expression in the ectoderm that overlaps the reduced and vestigial digit rudiments of the pig handplate, respectively. Furthermore, genome-wide open chromatin profiling using equivalent developmental stages of mouse and pig limb buds reveals the functional divergence of about one-third of the regulatory genome. This study uncovers widespread alterations in the regulatory landscapes of genes essential for limb development that likely contributed to the morphological diversion of artiodactyl limbs from the pentadactyl archetype of tetrapods.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial complex I harbors 7 mitochondrial and 38 nuclear-encoded subunits. Its biogenesis requires the assembly and integration of distinct intermediate modules, mediated by numerous assembly factors. The mitochondrial complex I intermediate assembly (MCIA) complex, containing assembly factors NDUFAF1, ECSIT, ACAD9, and TMEM126B, is required for building the intermediate ND2-module. The role of the MCIA complex and the involvement of other proteins in the biogenesis of this module is unclear. Cell knockout studies reveal that while each MCIA component is critical for complex I assembly, a hierarchy of stability exists centered on ACAD9. We also identify TMEM186 and COA1 as bona fide components of the MCIA complex with loss of either resulting in MCIA complex defects and reduced complex I assembly. TMEM186 enriches with newly translated ND3, and COA1 enriches with ND2. Our findings provide new functional insights into the essential nature of the MCIA complex in complex I assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key orchestrator of anti-microbial immunity whose secretion is typically dependent on activation of inflammasomes. However, many pathogens have evolved strategies to evade inflammasome activation. Here we describe an alternative, two-cell model for IL-1β release where invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells use the death receptor pathway to instruct antigen-presenting cells to secrete IL-1β. Following cognate interactions with TLR-primed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), iNKT cells rapidly translocate intracellular Fas ligand to the surface to engage Fas on BMDCs. Fas ligation activates a caspase-8-dependent signaling cascade in BMDCs that drives IL-1β release largely independent of inflammasomes. The apoptotic program initiated by Fas ligation rapidly transitions into a pyroptosis-like form of cell death mediated by gasdermin D. Together, our findings support a two-cell model for IL-1β secretion that may supersede inflammasome activation when cytosolic triggers fail.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles are important mediators of cell-to-cell communication during tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived ectosomes remodel the tumor microenvironment to facilitate HCC progression in an ectosomal PKM2-dependent manner. HCC-derived ectosomal PKM2 induced not only metabolic reprogramming in monocytes but also STAT3 phosphorylation in the nucleus to upregulate differentiation-associated transcription factors, leading to monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and tumor microenvironment remodeling. In HCC cells, sumoylation of PKM2 induced its plasma membrane targeting and subsequent ectosomal excretion via interactions with ARRDC1. The PKM2-ARRDC1 association in HCC was reinforced by macrophage-secreted cytokines/chemokines in a CCL1-CCR8 axis-dependent manner, further facilitating PKM2 excretion from HCC cells to form a feedforward regulatory loop for tumorigenesis. In the clinic, ectosomal PKM2 was clearly detected in the plasma of HCC patients. This study highlights a mechanism by which ectosomal PKM2 remodels the tumor microenvironment and reveals ectosomal PKM2 as a potential diagnostic marker for HCC.

Abstract: Summary
NAD+ is a redox-active metabolite, the depletion of which has been proposed to promote aging and degenerative diseases in rodents. However, whether NAD+ depletion occurs in patients with degenerative disorders and whether NAD+ repletion improves their symptoms has remained open. Here, we report systemic NAD+ deficiency in adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy patients. We administered an increasing dose of NAD+-booster niacin, a vitamin B3 form (to 750–1,000 mg/day; clinicaltrials.gov NCT03973203) for patients and their matched controls for 10 or 4 months, respectively. Blood NAD+ increased in all subjects, up to 8-fold, and muscle NAD+ of patients reached the level of their controls. Some patients showed anemia tendency, while muscle strength and mitochondrial biogenesis increased in all subjects. In patients, muscle metabolome shifted toward controls and liver fat decreased even 50%. Our evidence indicates that blood analysis is useful in identifying NAD+ deficiency and points niacin to be an efficient NAD+ booster for treating mitochondrial myopathy.

Abstract: Summary
CAG-repeat expansions in at least eight different genes cause neurodegeneration. The length of the extended polyglutamine stretches in the corresponding proteins is proportionally related to their aggregation propensity. Although these proteins are ubiquitously expressed, they predominantly cause toxicity to neurons. To understand this neuronal hypersensitivity, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and Huntington’s disease patients. iPSC generation and neuronal differentiation are unaffected by polyglutamine proteins and show no spontaneous aggregate formation. However, upon glutamate treatment, aggregates form in neurons but not in patient-derived neural progenitors. During differentiation, the chaperone network is drastically rewired, including loss of expression of the anti-amyloidogenic chaperone DNAJB6. Upregulation of DNAJB6 in neurons antagonizes glutamate-induced aggregation, while knockdown of DNAJB6 in progenitors results in spontaneous polyglutamine aggregation. Loss of DNAJB6 expression upon differentiation is confirmed in vivo, explaining why stem cells are intrinsically protected against amyloidogenesis and protein aggregates are dominantly present in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
DC-SIGN+ monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) play important roles in bacterial infections and inflammatory diseases, but the factors regulating their differentiation and proinflammatory status remain poorly defined. Here, we identify a microRNA, miR-181a, and a molecular mechanism that simultaneously regulate the acquisition of DC-SIGN expression and the activation state of DC-SIGN+ mo-DCs. Specifically, we show that miR-181a promotes DC-SIGN expression during terminal mo-DC differentiation and limits its sensitivity and responsiveness to TLR triggering and CD40 ligation. Mechanistically, miR-181a sustains ERK-MAPK signaling in mo-DCs, thereby enabling the maintenance of high levels of DC-SIGN and a high activation threshold. Low miR-181a levels during mo-DC differentiation, induced by inflammatory signals, do not support the high phospho-ERK signal transduction required for DC-SIGNhi mo-DCs and lead to development of proinflammatory DC-SIGNlo/− mo-DCs. Collectively, our study demonstrates that high DC-SIGN expression levels and a high activation threshold in mo-DCs are linked and simultaneously maintained by miR-181a.

Abstract: Summary
Diffusely infiltrating gliomas are known to cause alterations in cortical function, vascular disruption, and seizures. These neurological complications present major clinical challenges, yet their underlying mechanisms and causal relationships to disease progression are poorly characterized. Here, we follow glioma progression in awake Thy1-GCaMP6f mice using in vivo wide-field optical mapping to monitor alterations in both neuronal activity and functional hemodynamics. The bilateral synchrony of spontaneous neuronal activity gradually decreases in glioma-infiltrated cortical regions, while neurovascular coupling becomes progressively disrupted compared to uninvolved cortex. Over time, mice develop diverse patterns of high amplitude discharges and eventually generalized seizures that appear to originate at the tumors’ infiltrative margins. Interictal and seizure events exhibit positive neurovascular coupling in uninfiltrated cortex; however, glioma-infiltrated regions exhibit disrupted hemodynamic responses driving seizure-evoked hypoxia. These results reveal a landscape of complex physiological interactions occurring during glioma progression and present new opportunities for exploring novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy involves engulfment of cytoplasmic contents by double-membraned autophagosomes, which ultimately fuse with lysosomes to enable degradation of their substrates. We recently proposed that the tubular-vesicular recycling endosome membranes were a core platform on which the critical early events of autophagosome formation occurred, including LC3-membrane conjugation to autophagic precursors. Here, we report that the release of autophagosome precursors from recycling endosomes is mediated by DNM2-dependent scission of these tubules. This process is regulated by DNM2 binding to LC3 and is increased by autophagy-inducing stimuli. This scission is defective in cells expressing a centronuclear-myopathy-causing DNM2 mutant. This mutant has an unusual mechanism as it depletes normal-functioning DNM2 from autophagosome formation sites on recycling endosomes by causing increased binding to an alternative plasma membrane partner, ITSN1. This “scission” step is, thus, critical for autophagosome formation, is defective in a human disease, and influences the way we consider how autophagosomes are formed.

Abstract: Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is well known for its role in allergic inflammation. For cancer, both pro- and anti-tumor effects of IL-9 were controversially reported, but the impact of IL-9 on tumor metastasis has not yet been clarified. In this study, IL-9 was expressed as a secretory form (sIL-9) and a membrane-bound form (mbIL-9) on B16F10 melanoma cells. The mbIL-9 was engineered as a chimeric protein with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of TNF-α. The effect of either mbIL-9 or sIL-9 expressing cells were analyzed on the metastasis capability of the cancer cells. After three weeks of tumor implantation into C57BL/6 mice through the tail vein, the number of tumor modules in lungs injected with IL-9 expressing B16F10 was 5-fold less than that of control groups. The percentages of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and M1 macrophages considerably increased in the lungs of the mice injected with IL-9 expressing cells. Among them, the M1 macrophage subset was the most significantly enhanced. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages, which were stimulated with either sIL-9 or mbIL-9 expressing transfectant, exerted higher anti-tumor cytotoxicity compared with that of the mock control. The IL-9-stimulated peritoneal macrophages were highly polarized to M1 phenotype. Stimulation of RAW264.7 macrophages with sIL-9 or mbIL-9 expressing cells also significantly increased the cytotoxicity of those macrophages against wild-type B16F10 cells. These results clearly demonstrate that IL-9 can induce an anti-metastasis effect by enhancing the polarization and proliferation of M1 macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Mice engineered for conditional, cell type-specific gene inactivation have dominated the field of mouse genetics because of the high efficiency of Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technologies have provided alternatives for rapid gene mutagenesis for loss-of-function (LOF) analysis. Whether these strategies can be streamlined for rapid genetic analysis with the efficiencies comparable with those of conventional genetic approaches has yet to be established. We show that a single adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector containing a recombinase-dependent Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) are as efficient as conventional conditional gene knockout and can be adapted for use in either Cre- or Flp-driver mouse lines. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated for the analysis of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and monoaminergic neurotransmission. Using this strategy, we reveal insight into the role of GABAergic regulation of midbrain GABA-producing neurons in psychomotor activation.

Abstract: Summary
Expanded CAG repeats form stem-loop secondary structures that lead to fork stalling and collapse. Previous work has shown that these collapsed forks relocalize to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in late S phase in a manner dependent on replication, the nucleoporin Nup84, and the Slx5 protein, which prevents repeat fragility and instability. Here, we show that binding of the Smc5/6 complex to the collapsed fork triggers Mms21-dependent sumoylation of fork-associated DNA repair proteins, and that RPA, Rad52, and Rad59 are the key sumoylation targets that mediate relocation. The SUMO interacting motifs of Slx5 target collapsed forks to the NPC. Notably, Rad51 foci only co-localize with the repeat after it is anchored to the nuclear periphery and Rad51 exclusion from the early collapsed fork is dependent on RPA sumoylation. This pathway may provide a mechanism to constrain recombination at stalled or collapsed forks until it is required for fork restart.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare, therapeutically intractable liver cancer that disproportionately affects youth. Although FLC tumors exhibit a distinct gene expression profile, the chromatin regulatory landscape and the genes most critical for tumor cell survival remain unclear. Here, we use chromatin run-on sequencing to discover ∼7,000 enhancers and 141 enhancer hotspots activated in FLC relative to nonmalignant liver. Bioinformatic analyses reveal aberrant ERK/MEK signaling and candidate master transcriptional regulators. We also define the genes most strongly associated with hotspots of FLC enhancer activity, including CA12 and SLC16A14. Treatment of FLC cell models with inhibitors of CA12 or SLC16A14 independently reduce cell viability and/or significantly enhance the effect of the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. These findings highlight molecular targets for drug development, as well as drug combination approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Radical cure of HIV-1 (HIV) is hampered by the establishment of HIV reservoirs and persistent infection in deep tissues despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we show that among HIV-positive women receiving suppressive ART, cells from placental tissues including trophoblasts contain HIV RNA and DNA. These viruses can be reactivated by latency reversal agents. We find that syncytin, the envelope glycoprotein of human endogenous retrovirus family W1 expressed on placental trophoblasts, triggers cell fusion with HIV-infected T cells. This results in cell-to-cell spread of HIV to placental trophoblasts. Such cell-to-cell spread of HIV is less sensitive to ART than free virus. Replication in syncytin-expressing cells can also produce syncytin-pseudotyped HIV, further expanding its ability to infect non-CD4 cells. These previously unrecognized mechanisms of HIV entry enable the virus to bypass receptor restriction to infect host barrier cells, thereby facilitating viral transmission and persistent infection in deep tissues.

Abstract: Summary
The development of precision medicine approaches for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is confounded by its pronounced genetic, phenotypic, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent multiplatform genomic studies revealed the existence of genetic subtypes of DLBCL using clustering methodologies. Here, we describe an algorithm that determines the probability that a patient's lymphoma belongs to one of seven genetic subtypes based on its genetic features. This classification reveals genetic similarities between these DLBCL subtypes and various indolent and extranodal lymphoma types, suggesting a shared pathogenesis. These genetic subtypes also have distinct gene expression profiles, immune microenvironments, and outcomes following immunochemotherapy. Functional analysis of genetic subtype models highlights distinct vulnerabilities to targeted therapy, supporting the use of this classification in precision medicine trials.

Abstract: Summary
Cells rely on input from extracellular growth factors to control their proliferation during development and adult homeostasis. Such mitogenic inputs are transmitted through multiple signaling pathways that synergize to precisely regulate cell cycle entry and progression. Although the architecture of these signaling networks has been characterized in molecular detail, their relative contribution, especially at later cell cycle stages, remains largely unexplored. By combining quantitative time-resolved measurements of fluorescent reporters in untransformed human cells with targeted pharmacological inhibitors and statistical analysis, we quantify epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced signal processing in individual cells over time and dissect the dynamic contribution of downstream pathways. We define signaling features that encode information about extracellular ligand concentrations and critical time windows for inducing cell cycle transitions. We show that both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity are necessary for initial cell cycle entry, whereas only PI3K affects the duration of S phase at later stages of mitogenic signaling.

Abstract: Summary
A drastic transition at birth, from constant maternal nutrient supply in utero to intermittent postnatal feeding, requires changes in the metabolic system of the neonate. Despite their central role in metabolic homeostasis, little is known about how pancreatic β cells adjust to the new nutritional challenge. Here, we find that after birth β cell function shifts from amino acid- to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in correlation with the change in the nutritional environment. This adaptation is mediated by a transition in nutrient sensitivity of the mTORC1 pathway, which leads to intermittent mTORC1 activity. Disrupting nutrient sensitivity of mTORC1 in mature β cells reverts insulin secretion to a functionally immature state. Finally, manipulating nutrient sensitivity of mTORC1 in stem cell-derived β cells in vitro strongly enhances their glucose-responsive insulin secretion. These results reveal a mechanism by which nutrients regulate β cell function, thereby enabling a metabolic adaptation for the newborn.

Abstract: Summary
Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is associated with poor prognosis despite current multimodal therapy. Targeting of EWS-FLI1, the fusion protein responsible for its pathogenesis, and its principal downstream targets has not yet produced satisfactory therapeutic options, fueling the search for alternative approaches. Here, we show that the oncofetal RNA-binding protein LIN28B regulates the stability of EWS-FLI1 mRNA in ~10% of EwSs. LIN28B depletion in these tumors leads to a decrease in the expression of EWS-FLI1 and its direct transcriptional network, abrogating EwS cell self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of LIN28B mimics the effect of LIN28B depletion, suggesting that LIN28B sustains the emergence of a subset of EwS in which it also serves as an effective therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Cas13 has demonstrated unique and broad utility in RNA editing, nucleic acid detection, and disease diagnosis; however, a constantly active Cas enzyme may induce unwanted effects. Bacteriophage- or prophage-region-encoded anti-CRISPR (acr) gene molecules provide the potential to control targeting specificity and potency to allow for optimal RNA editing and nucleic acid detection by spatiotemporally modulating endonuclease activities. Using integrated approaches to screen acrVI candidates and evaluate their effects on Cas13 function, we discovered a series of acrVIA1-7 genes that block the activities of Cas13a. These VI-A CRISPR inhibitors substantially attenuate RNA targeting and editing by Cas13a in human cells. Strikingly, type VI-A anti-CRISPRs (AcrVIAs) also significantly muffle the single-nucleic-acid editing ability of the dCas13a RNA-editing system. Mechanistically, AcrVIA1, -4, -5, and -6 bind LwaCas13a, while AcrVIA2 and -3 can only bind the LwaCas13-crRNA (CRISPR RNA) complex. These identified acr molecules may enable precise RNA editing in Cas13-based application and study of phage-bacterium interaction.

Abstract: Summary
Microprocessor initiates the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs) from the hairpin regions of primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Pri-miRNAs often contain multiple miRNA hairpins, and this clustered arrangement can assist in the processing of otherwise defective hairpins. We find that miR-451, which derives from a hairpin with a suboptimal terminal loop and a suboptimal stem length, accumulates to 40-fold higher levels when clustered with a helper hairpin. This phenomenon tolerates changes in hairpin order, linker lengths, and the identities of the helper hairpin, the recipient hairpin, the linker-sequence, and the RNA polymerase that transcribes the hairpins. It can act reciprocally and need not occur co-transcriptionally. It requires Microprocessor recognition of the helper hairpin and linkage of the two hairpins, yet predominantly manifests after helper-hairpin processing. It also requires enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH), which copurifies with Microprocessor and can dimerize and interact with other proteins that can dimerize, suggesting a model in which one Microprocessor recruits another Microprocessor.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic replisome, organized around the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase, orchestrates chromosome replication. Multiple factors associate directly with CMG, including Ctf4 and the heterotrimeric fork protection complex (Csm3/Tof1 and Mrc1), which has important roles including aiding normal replication rates and stabilizing stalled forks. How these proteins interface with CMG to execute these functions is poorly understood. Here we present 3 to 3.5 Å resolution electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures comprising CMG, Ctf4, and the fork protection complex at a replication fork. The structures provide high-resolution views of CMG-DNA interactions, revealing a mechanism for strand separation, and show Csm3/Tof1 “grip” duplex DNA ahead of CMG via a network of interactions important for efficient replication fork pausing. Although Mrc1 was not resolved in our structures, we determine its topology in the replisome by cross-linking mass spectrometry. Collectively, our work reveals how four highly conserved replisome components collaborate with CMG to facilitate replisome progression and maintain genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
Immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β cells causes type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, how β cells participate in their own destruction during the disease process is poorly understood. Here, we report that modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in β cells of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice by deleting the UPR sensor IRE1α prior to insulitis induced a transient dedifferentiation of β cells, resulting in substantially reduced islet immune cell infiltration and β cell apoptosis. Single-cell and whole-islet transcriptomics analyses of immature β cells revealed remarkably diminished expression of β cell autoantigens and MHC class I components, and upregulation of immune inhibitory markers. IRE1α-deficient mice exhibited significantly fewer cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in their pancreata, and adoptive transfer of their total T cells did not induce diabetes in Rag1−/− mice. Our results indicate that inducing β cell dedifferentiation, prior to insulitis, allows these cells to escape immune-mediated destruction and may be used as a novel preventive strategy for T1D in high-risk individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Sertoli cells are supporting cells of the testicular seminiferous tubules, which provide a nurturing environment for spermatogenesis. Adult Sertoli cells are polarized so that they can simultaneously support earlier-stage spermatogenic cells (e.g., spermatogonia) basally and later-stage cells (e.g., spermatids) apically. To test the consequences of disrupting cell polarity in Sertoli cells, we perform a Sertoli-specific conditional deletion of Rac1, which encodes a Rho GTPase required for apicobasal cell polarity. Rac1 conditional knockout adults exhibit spermatogenic arrest at the round spermatid stage, with severe disruption of Sertoli cell polarity, and show increased germline and Sertoli cell apoptosis. Thus, Sertoli Rac1 function is critical for the progression of spermatogenesis but, surprisingly, is dispensable for fetal testicular development, adult maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia, and meiotic entry. Our data indicate that Sertoli Rac1 function is required only for certain aspects of spermatogenesis and reveal that there are distinct requirements for cell polarity during cellular differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Yeast cells must grow to a critical size before committing to division. It is unknown how size is measured. We find that as cells grow, mRNAs for some cell-cycle activators scale faster than size, increasing in concentration, while mRNAs for some inhibitors scale slower than size, decreasing in concentration. Size-scaled gene expression could cause an increasing ratio of activators to inhibitors with size, triggering cell-cycle entry. Consistent with this, expression of the CLN2 activator from the promoter of the WHI5 inhibitor, or vice versa, interfered with cell size homeostasis, yielding a broader distribution of cell sizes. We suggest that size homeostasis comes from differential scaling of gene expression with size. Differential regulation of gene expression as a function of cell size could affect many cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
Brain endothelial cells (BECs) are key constituents of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), protecting the brain from pathogens and restricting access of circulatory factors. Yet, because circulatory proteins have prominent age-related effects on adult neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function in mice, we wondered whether BECs receive and potentially relay signals between the blood and brain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal BECs, we discover that capillary BECs—compared with arterial and venous BECs—undergo the greatest transcriptional changes in normal aging, upregulating innate immunity and oxidative stress response pathways. Short-term infusions of aged plasma into young mice recapitulate key aspects of this aging transcriptome, and remarkably, infusions of young plasma into aged mice exert rejuvenation effects on the capillary transcriptome. Together, these findings suggest that the transcriptional age of BECs is exquisitely sensitive to age-related circulatory cues and pinpoint the BBB itself as a promising therapeutic target to treat brain disease.

Abstract: Summary
Our knowledge of transcriptional heterogeneities in epithelial stem and progenitor cell compartments is limited. Epidermal basal cells sustain cutaneous tissue maintenance and drive wound healing. Previous studies have probed basal cell heterogeneity in stem and progenitor potential, but a comprehensive dissection of basal cell dynamics during differentiation is lacking. Using single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with RNAScope and fluorescence lifetime imaging, we identify three non-proliferative and one proliferative basal cell state in homeostatic skin that differ in metabolic preference and become spatially partitioned during wound re-epithelialization. Pseudotemporal trajectory and RNA velocity analyses predict a quasi-linear differentiation hierarchy where basal cells progress from Col17a1Hi/Trp63Hi state to early-response state, proliferate at the juncture of these two states, or become growth arrested before differentiating into spinous cells. Wound healing induces plasticity manifested by dynamic basal-spinous interconversions at multiple basal transcriptional states. Our study provides a systematic view of epidermal cellular dynamics, supporting a revised “hierarchical-lineage” model of homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
SPRY2 is a purported tumor suppressor in certain cancers that promotes tumor growth and resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in glioblastoma. Here, we identify a SPRY2-dependent bypass signaling mechanism in glioblastoma that drives resistance to EGFR and MET inhibition. In glioblastoma cells treated with EGFR and MET inhibitors, SPRY2 expression is initially suppressed but eventually rebounds due to NF-κB pathway activation, resultant autocrine FGFR activation, and reactivation of ERK, which controls SPRY2 transcription. In cells where FGFR autocrine signaling does not occur and ERK does not reactivate, or in which ERK reactivates but SPRY2 cannot be expressed, EGFR and MET inhibitors are more effective at promoting death. The same mechanism also drives acquired resistance to EGFR and MET inhibition. Furthermore, tumor xenografts expressing an ERK-dependent bioluminescent reporter engineered for these studies reveal that this bypass resistance mechanism plays out in vivo but can be overcome through simultaneous FGFR inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
T cell factor 1 (Tcf1) promotes the central memory CD8+ T (TCM) cell differentiation and stemness in lymphoid tissues after systemic infections. It remains unclear whether Tcf1 regulates the CD103high tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cell formation in non-lymphoid tissues after mucosal infections. We find that Tcf1 is progressively decreased during lung TRM cell formation. Abrogation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling is associated with a loss of CD103+ and reciprocal gain of Tcf1+ cells among TRM precursors in vivo. T-cell-specific ablation of Tcf7 enhances CD103 protein expression in TRM cells and precursors and increases TRM cell numbers after primary and secondary infections. Tcf1 directly binds to the Itgae (encoding CD103) locus and partly inhibits TGF-β-induced CD103 expression. Our study suggests that memory T cell tissue residency and homeostatic proliferation are reciprocally regulated by Tcf1. Tcf1 may play either immunosupportive or immunosuppressive roles in CD8+ T cells, depending on systemic or mucosal infections.

Abstract: Summary
The emerging appreciation of plasticity among pancreatic lineages has created interest in harnessing cellular reprogramming for β cell replacement therapy of diabetes. Current reprogramming methodologies are inefficient, largely because of a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Using an in vitro reprogramming system, we reveal the transcriptional repressor RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) as a barrier for β cell gene expression in the reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine cells. We observe that REST-bound loci lie adjacent to the binding sites of multiple key β cell transcription factors, including PDX1. Accordingly, a loss of REST function combined with PDX1 expression results in the synergistic activation of endocrine genes. This is accompanied by increased histone acetylation and PDX1 binding at endocrine gene loci. Collectively, our data identify a mechanism for REST activity involving the prevention of PDX1-mediated activation of endocrine genes and uncover REST downregulation and the resulting chromatin alterations as key events in β cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Enhanced host protection against re-infection requires generation of memory T cells of sufficient quantity and functional quality. Unlike well-studied inbred mice, T cell responses of diverse size and quality are generated following infection of humans and outbred mice. Thus, additional models are needed that accurately reflect variation in immune outcomes in genetically diverse populations and to uncover underlying genetic causes. The Collaborative Cross (CC), a large recombinant inbred panel of mice, is an ideal model in this pursuit for the high degree of genetic variation present, because it allows for assessment of genetic factors underlying unique phenotypes. Here, we advance the utility of the CC as a tool to analyze the immune response to viral infection. We describe variability in resting immune cell composition and adaptive immune responses generated among CC strains following systemic virus infection and reveal quantitative trait loci responsible for generation of CD62L+ memory CD8 T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Whereas hundreds of cells in the mouse embryonic aorta transdifferentiate to hematopoietic cells, only very few establish hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) identity at a single time point. The Gata2 transcription factor is essential for HSC generation and function. In contrast to surface-marker-based cell isolation, Gata2-based enrichment provides a direct link to the internal HSC regulatory network. Here, we use iterations of index-sorting of Gata2-expressing intra-aortic hematopoietic cluster (IAHC) cells, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional analyses to connect HSC identity to specific gene expression. Gata2-expressing IAHC cells separate into 5 major transcriptomic clusters. Iterative analyses reveal refined CD31, cKit, and CD27 phenotypic parameters that associate specific molecular profiles in one cluster with distinct HSC and multipotent progenitor function. Thus, by iterations of single-cell approaches, we identify the transcriptome of the first functional HSCs as they emerge in the mouse embryo and localize them to aortic clusters containing 1–2 cells.

Abstract: Hippo signaling acts as a tumor suppressor pathway by inhibiting the proliferation of adult stem cells and progenitor cells in various organs. Liver-specific deletion of Hippo pathway components in mice induces liver cancer development through activation of the transcriptional coactivators, YAP and TAZ, which exhibit nuclear enrichment and are activated in numerous types of cancer. The upstream-most regulators of Warts, the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian LATS1/2, are Kibra, Expanded, and Merlin. However, the roles of the corresponding mammalian orthologs, WWC1, FRMD6 and NF2, in the regulation of LATS1/2 activity and liver tumorigenesis in vivo are not fully understood. Here, we show that deletion of both Wwc1 and Nf2 in the liver accelerates intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) development through activation of YAP/TAZ. Additionally, biliary epithelial cell-specific deletion of both Lats1 and Lats2 using a Sox9-CreERT2 system resulted in iCCA development through hyperactivation of YAP/TAZ. These findings suggest that WWC1 and NF2 cooperate to promote suppression of cholangiocarcinoma development by inhibiting the oncogenic activity of YAP/TAZ via LATS1/2.

Abstract: This study analyzed the architecture of Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) clots and assessed their elemental composition in order to provide new insight into this biomaterial. Five surplus PRF clots (2,700 RPM, 12 min.) donated by patients (63.6 ± 12.3 years old) were prepared for use in dental clinical procedures. The internal three-dimensional morphology of the red zones and the thirds of the yellow zones of the clots were analyzed by Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (VPSEM) after sample preparation by two methods: 1. Fixation (2.5% gluataraldehyde); and 2. Fixation with subsequent partial removal of extracellular elements (8 N, HCl). Semi-quantitative elemental analysis was performed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). VPSEM analysis showed erythrocytes in both the red zone and the yellow zone, which consisted mainly of fibrin. Removal of extracellular elements enriched the morphology of both zones; the organization of the fibrin was observed to differ in the thirds of the yellow zone, with increasing density and organization to distal. The elements that compose organic substances (C-Carbon, N-Nitrogen, O-Oxygen, Na-Sodium and P-Phosphorus) and halogens (Cl-Chloride and S-Sulfur) were detected; the highest concentrations were of C, followed by O (p < 0.05), in the proximal region of the fibrin. The results of the present study suggest organization of fibrin in the PRF clot, and also reveal the distribution of the elements present in the different regions of the clot. Improved understanding of these characteristics may favor the use of this biomaterial by increasing its efficiency and functionality.

Abstract: Summary
Delineating how chromosomes fold at length scales beyond one megabase remains obscure relative to smaller-scale folding into TADs, loops, and nucleosomes. We find that rather than simply unfolding chromatin, histone hyperacetylation results in interactions between distant genomic loci separated by tens to hundreds of megabases, even in the absence of transcription. These hyperacetylated “megadomains” are formed by the BRD4-NUT fusion oncoprotein, interact both within and between chromosomes, and form a specific nuclear subcompartment that has elevated gene activity with respect to other subcompartments. Pharmacological degradation of BRD4-NUT results in collapse of megadomains and attenuation of the interactions between them. In contrast, these interactions persist and contacts between newly acetylated regions are formed after inhibiting RNA polymerase II initiation. Our structure-function approach thus reveals that broad chromatin domains of identical biochemical composition, independent of transcription, form nuclear subcompartments, and also indicates the potential of altering chromosome structure for treating human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Studies in cultured neurons have established that axon specification instructs neuronal polarization and is necessary for dendrite development. However, dendrite formation in vivo occurs when axon formation is prevented. The mechanisms promoting dendrite development remain elusive. We find that apical dendrite development is directed by a localized cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-synthesizing complex. We show that the scaffolding protein Scribble associates with cGMP-synthesizing enzymes soluble-guanylate-cyclase (sGC) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The Scribble scaffold is preferentially localized to and mediates cGMP increase in dendrites. These events are regulated by kinesin KifC2. Knockdown of Scribble, sGC-β1, or KifC2 or disrupting their associations prevents cGMP increase in dendrites and causes severe defects in apical dendrite development. Local cGMP elevation or sGC expression rescues the effects of Scribble knockdown on dendrite development, indicating that Scribble is an upstream regulator of cGMP. During neuronal polarization, dendrite development is directed by the Scribble scaffold that might link extracellular cues to localized cGMP increase.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing evidence that gut microbiome perturbations, also known as dysbiosis, can influence colorectal cancer development. To understand the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome modulates cancer susceptibility, we examine two wild-type mouse colonies with distinct gut microbial communities that develop significantly different tumor numbers using a mouse model of inflammation-associated tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that adaptive immune cells contribute to the different tumor susceptibilities associated with the two microbial communities. Mice that develop more tumors have increased colon lamina propria CD8+ IFNγ+ T cells before tumorigenesis but reduced CD8+ IFNγ+ T cells in tumors and adjacent tissues compared with mice that develop fewer tumors. Notably, intratumoral T cells in mice that develop more tumors exhibit increased exhaustion. Thus, these studies suggest that microbial dysbiosis can contribute to colon tumor susceptibility by hyperstimulating CD8 T cells to promote chronic inflammation and early T cell exhaustion, which can reduce anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression is regulated by the rates of synthesis and degradation of mRNAs, but how these processes are coordinated is poorly understood. Here, we show that reduced transcription dynamics of specific genes leads to enhanced m6A deposition, preferential activity of the CCR4-Not complex, shortened poly(A) tails, and reduced stability of the respective mRNAs. These effects are also exerted by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, which we found to be transcriptional pause sites. However, when transcription dynamics, and subsequently poly(A) tails, are globally altered, cells buffer mRNA levels by adjusting the expression of mRNA degradation machinery. Stress-provoked global impediment of transcription elongation leads to a dramatic inhibition of the mRNA degradation machinery and massive mRNA stabilization. Accordingly, globally enhanced transcription, such as following B cell activation or glucose stimulation, has the opposite effects. This study uncovers two molecular pathways that maintain balanced gene expression in mammalian cells by linking transcription to mRNA stability.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells orchestrate their microenvironment. Here, we provide biochemical, structural, functional, and clinical evidence that Cathepsin S (CTSS) alterations induce a tumor-promoting immune microenvironment in follicular lymphoma (FL). We found CTSS mutations at Y132 in 6% of FL (19/305). Another 13% (37/286) had CTSS amplification, which was associated with higher CTSS expression. CTSS Y132 mutations lead to accelerated autocatalytic conversion from an enzymatically inactive profrom to active CTSS and increased substrate cleavage, including CD74, which regulates major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II)-restricted antigen presentation. Lymphoma cells with hyperactive CTSS more efficiently activated antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in vitro. Tumors with hyperactive CTSS showed increased CD4+ T cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine perturbation in a mouse model and in human FLs. In mice, this CTSS-induced immune microenvironment promoted tumor growth. Clinically, patients with CTSS-hyperactive FL had better treatment outcomes with standard immunochemotherapies, indicating that these immunosuppressive regimens target both the lymphoma cells and the tumor-promoting immune microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
The transition from the follicular B to the plasma cell stage is associated with large-scale changes in cell morphology. Here, we examine whether plasma cell development is also associated with changes in nuclear architecture. We find that the onset of plasma cell development is concomitant with a decline in remote genomic interactions; a gain in euchromatic character at loci encoding for factors that specify plasma cell fate, including Prdm1 and Atf4; and establishment of de novo inter-chromosomal hubs. We find that, in developing plasma cells and concurrent with transcriptional silencing, the Ebf1 locus repositions from an euchromatic to peri-centromeric heterochromatic environment. Finally, we find that inter-chromosomal hubs are enriched for the deposition of either H3K27Ac or H3K27me3. These data indicate that plasma cell fate is orchestrated by elaborate changes in genome topology and that epigenetic marks, linked with super-enhancers or transcriptionally repressed regions, are enriched at inter-chromosomal hubs.

Abstract: Summary
The cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) drives cell division. To uncover additional functions of Cdk1, we generated knockin mice expressing an analog-sensitive version of Cdk1 in place of wild-type Cdk1. In our study, we focused on embryonic stem cells (ESCs), because this cell type displays particularly high Cdk1 activity. We found that in ESCs, a large fraction of Cdk1 substrates is localized on chromatin. Cdk1 phosphorylates many proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, including writers and erasers of all major histone marks. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of Cdk1 altered histone-modification status of ESCs. High levels of Cdk1 in ESCs phosphorylate and partially inactivate Dot1l, the H3K79 methyltransferase responsible for placing activating marks on gene bodies. Decrease of Cdk1 activity during ESC differentiation de-represses Dot1l, thereby allowing coordinated expression of differentiation genes. These analyses indicate that Cdk1 functions to maintain the epigenetic identity of ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiolipin (CL) is a phospholipid specific for mitochondrial membranes and crucial for many core tasks of this organelle. Its acyl chain configurations are tissue specific, functionally important, and generated via post-biosynthetic remodeling. However, this process lacks the necessary specificity to explain CL diversity, which is especially evident for highly specific CL compositions in mammalian tissues. To investigate the so far elusive regulatory origin of CL homeostasis in mice, we combine lipidomics, integrative transcriptomics, and data-driven machine learning. We demonstrate that not transcriptional regulation, but cellular phospholipid compositions are closely linked to the tissue specificity of CL patterns allowing artificial neural networks to precisely predict cross-tissue CL compositions in a consistent mechanistic specificity rationale. This is especially relevant for the interpretation of disease-related perturbations of CL homeostasis, by allowing differentiation between specific aberrations in CL metabolism and changes caused by global alterations in cellular (phospho-)lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies of bacterial DNA replication have led to a picture of the replisome as an entity that freely exchanges DNA polymerases and displays intermittent coupling between the helicase and polymerase(s). Challenging the textbook model of the polymerase holoenzyme acting as a stable complex coordinating the replisome, these observations suggest a role of the helicase as the central organizing hub. We show here that the molecular origin of this newly found plasticity lies in the 500-fold increase in strength of the interaction between the polymerase holoenzyme and the replicative helicase upon association of the primase with the replisome. By combining in vitro ensemble-averaged and single-molecule assays, we demonstrate that this conformational switch operates during replication and promotes recruitment of multiple holoenzymes at the fork. Our observations provide a molecular mechanism for polymerase exchange and offer a revised model for the replication reaction that emphasizes its stochasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome structure is a key regulator of gene expression. CTCF and cohesin play critical roles in structuring chromosomes by mediating physical interactions between distant genomic sites. The resulting DNA loops often contain genes and their cis-regulatory elements. Despite the importance of DNA loops in maintaining proper transcriptional regulation and cell identity, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate their dynamics and function. We report a previously unrecognized role for WIZ (widely interspaced zinc finger-containing protein) in DNA loop architecture and regulation of gene expression. WIZ forms a complex with cohesin and CTCF that occupies enhancers, promoters, insulators, and anchors of DNA loops. Aberrant WIZ function alters cohesin occupancy and increases the number of DNA loop structures in the genome. WIZ is required for proper gene expression and transcriptional insulation. Our results uncover an unexpected role for WIZ in DNA loop architecture, transcriptional control, and maintenance of cell identity.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the prenatal neocortex progressively generate different subtypes of glutamatergic projection neurons. Following that, NSCs have a major switch in their progenitor properties and produce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) interneurons for the olfactory bulb (OB), cortical oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Herein, we provide evidence for the molecular mechanism that underlies this switch in the state of neocortical NSCs. We show that, at around E16.5, mouse neocortical NSCs start to generate GSX2-expressing (GSX2+) intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). In vivo lineage-tracing study revealed that GSX2+ IPC population gives rise not only to OB interneurons but also to cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, suggesting that they are a tri-potential population. We demonstrated that Sonic hedgehog signaling is both necessary and sufficient for the generation of GSX2+ IPCs by reducing GLI3R protein levels. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify the transcriptional profile of GSX2+ IPCs and the process of the lineage switch of cortical NSCs.

Abstract: Summary
While KRAS mutations are common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), effective treatments are lacking. Here, we report that half of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs aberrantly express the homeobox protein HOXC10, largely due to unappreciated defects in PRC2, which confers sensitivity to combined BET/MEK inhibitors in xenograft and PDX models. Efficacy of the combination is dependent on suppression of HOXC10 by BET inhibitors. We further show that HOXC10 regulates the expression of pre-replication complex (pre-RC) proteins in sensitive tumors. Accordingly, BET/MEK inhibitors suppress pre-RC proteins in cycling cells, triggering stalled replication, DNA damage, and death. These studies reveal a promising therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant NSCLCs, identify a predictive biomarker of response, and define a subset of NSCLCs with a targetable epigenetic vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
The small intestine is responsible for nutrient absorption and one of the most important interfaces between the environment and the body. During aging, changes of the epithelium lead to food malabsorption and reduced barrier function, thus increasing disease risk. The drivers of these alterations remain poorly understood. Here, we compare the proteomes of intestinal crypts from mice across different anatomical regions and ages. We find that aging alters epithelial immunity, metabolism, and cell proliferation and is accompanied by region-dependent skewing in the cellular composition of the epithelium. Of note, short-term dietary restriction followed by refeeding partially restores the epithelium by promoting stem cell differentiation toward the secretory lineage. We identify Hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [CoA] synthetase 2), the rate-limiting enzyme for ketogenesis, as a modulator of stem cell differentiation that responds to dietary changes, and we provide an atlas of region- and age-dependent proteome changes of the small intestine.

Abstract: Summary
All animals have evolved the ability to survive nutrient deprivation, and nutrient signaling pathways are conserved modulators of health and disease. In C. elegans, late-larval starvation provokes the adult reproductive diapause (ARD), a long-lived quiescent state that enables survival for months without food, yet underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that ARD is distinct from other forms of diapause, showing little requirement for canonical longevity pathways, autophagy, and fat metabolism. Instead it requires the HLH-30/TFEB transcription factor to promote the morphological and physiological remodeling involved in ARD entry, survival, and recovery, suggesting that HLH-30 is a master regulator of reproductive quiescence. HLH-30 transcriptome and genetic analyses reveal that Max-like HLH factors, AMP-kinase, mTOR, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial fusion are target processes that promote ARD longevity. ARD thus rewires metabolism to ensure long-term survival and may illuminate similar mechanisms acting in stem cell quiescence and long-term fasting.

Abstract: The aim of this research is to perform an analysis of the epineurial and endoneurial blood vessels in relation to aging. The research is conducted on samples of the human sciatic nerve of 12 case (age from 27 to 89). The histological sections are stained by streptavidin-biotin method of detecting the presence of Type IV collagen. After morphometric analysis the following stereological parameters have been calculated: the number of blood vessels per unit of area, the volume density of the blood vessels and the surface density of the blood vessels of the epineurium and endoneurium. An additional diameter measurement is performed for the endoneural blood vessels. In order to perform a more detailed analysis, the cases were classified into three age groups, the first (27–48 years), the second (49–70 years) and, the third (over 70 years). The bivariate correlation analysis showed that the number of blood vessels of the endoneurium, their volume and surface densities in relation to age produced a statistically significant positive correlation. One Way ANOVA test demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the number of endoneurial blood vessels in the age group III when compared the age group I and, in addition, it showed a significant decrease in the diameter of the age group II when compared to the age group I. Paired t – test shows a statistically significant higher number of endoneurial blood vessels in relation to the epineurial, namely, in the age group III. The volume and surface density of the epineurial blood vessels is significantly higher than the endoneurial in both the I and II age group. Age brings about significant changes of the endoneurial vascular network of the sciatic nerve due to the increase in density of the endoneurial blood vessels, their volume and surface densities. Consequently, in the cases older than 70 years, the number of endoneurial blood vessels significantly exceeds the number of epineurial blood vessels.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental question in microbial ecology is how microbes are spatially organized with respect to each other and their host. A test bed for examining this question is the tongue dorsum, which harbors a complex and important microbial community. Here, we use multiplexed fluorescence spectral imaging to investigate the organization of the tongue microbiome at micron to hundred-micron scales. We design oligonucleotide probes for taxa both abundant and prevalent, as determined by sequence analysis. Imaging reveals a highly structured spatial organization of microbial consortia, ranging in linear dimension from tens to hundreds of microns. The consortia appear to develop from a core of epithelial cells, with taxa clustering in domains suggestive of clonal expansion. Quantitative proximity analysis provides the basis for a model of tongue dorsum microbiome organization and dynamics. Our work illustrates how high-resolution analysis of micron-scale organization provides insights into physiological functions and microbiome-host interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have revealed non-canonical activities of apoptotic caspases involving specific modulation of gene expression, such as limiting asymmetric divisions of stem-like cell types. Here we report that CED-3 caspase negatively regulates an epidermal p38 stress-responsive MAPK pathway to promote larval development in C. elegans. We show that PMK-1 (p38 MAPK) primes animals for encounters with hostile environments at the expense of retarding post-embryonic development. CED-3 counters this function by directly cleaving PMK-1 to promote development. Moreover, we found that CED-3 and PMK-1 oppose each other to balance developmental and stress-responsive gene expression programs. Specifically, expression of more than 300 genes is inversely regulated by CED-3 and PMK-1. Analyses of these genes showed enrichment for epidermal stress-responsive factors, including the fatty acid synthase FASN-1, anti-microbial peptides, and genes involved in lethargus states. Our findings demonstrate a non-canonical role for a caspase in promoting development by limiting epidermal stress response programs.

Abstract: Summary
Physical forces generated by tissue-tissue interactions are a critical component of embryogenesis, aiding the formation of organs in a coordinated manner. In this study, using Xenopus laevis embryos and phosphoproteome analyses, we uncover the rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk2 upon stimulation with centrifugal, compression, or stretching force. We demonstrate that Erk2 induces the remodeling of cytoskeletal proteins, including F-actin, an embryonic cadherin C-cadherin, and the tight junction protein ZO-1. We show these force-dependent changes to be prerequisites for the enhancement of cellular junctions and tissue stiffening during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, Erk2 activation is FGFR1 dependent while not requiring fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands, suggesting that cell/tissue deformation triggers receptor activation in the absence of ligands. These findings establish previously unrecognized functions for mechanical forces in embryogenesis and reveal its underlying force-induced signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
TRPM8 is the main ion channel responsible for cold transduction in the somatosensory system. Nerve terminal availability of TRPM8 determines cold sensitivity, but how axonal secretory organelles control channel delivery remains poorly understood. Here we examine the distribution of TRPM8 and trafficking organelles in cold-sensitive peripheral axons and disrupt trafficking by targeting the ARF-GEF GBF1 pharmacologically or the small GTPase RAB6 by optogenetics. In axons of the sciatic nerve, inhibition of GBF1 interrupts TRPM8 trafficking and increases association with the trans-Golgi network, LAMP1, and Golgi satellites, which distribute profusely along the axonal shaft. Accordingly, both TRPM8-dependent ongoing activity and cold-evoked responses reversibly decline upon GBF1 inhibition in nerve endings of corneal cold thermoreceptors. Inhibition of RAB6, which also associates to Golgi satellites, decreases cold-induced responses in vivo. Our results support a non-conventional axonal trafficking mechanism controlling the availability of TRPM8 in axons and cold sensitivity in the peripheral nervous system.

Abstract: Summary
The majority of excitatory postsynaptic currents in the brain are gated through AMPA-type glutamate receptors, the kinetics and trafficking of which can be modulated by auxiliary proteins. It remains to be elucidated whether and how auxiliary proteins can modulate synaptic function to contribute to procedural memory formation. In this study, we report that the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) auxiliary protein SHISA6 (CKAMP52) is expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it co-localizes with GluA2-containing AMPARs. The absence of SHISA6 in Purkinje cells results in severe impairments in the adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and eyeblink conditioning. The physiological abnormalities include decreased presence of AMPARs in synaptosomes, impaired excitatory transmission, increased deactivation of AMPA receptors, and reduced induction of long-term potentiation at Purkinje cell synapses. Our data indicate that Purkinje cells require SHISA6-dependent modification of AMPAR function in order to facilitate cerebellar, procedural memory formation.

Abstract: Summary
Translation of consecutive proline motifs causes ribosome stalling and requires rescue via the action of a specific translation elongation factor, EF-P in bacteria and archaeal/eukaryotic a/eIF5A. In Eukarya, Archaea, and all bacteria investigated so far, the functionality of this translation elongation factor depends on specific and rather unusual post-translational modifications. The phylum Actinobacteria, which includes the genera Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, and Streptomyces, is of both medical and economic significance. Here, we report that EF-P is required in these bacteria in particular for the translation of proteins involved in amino acid and secondary metabolite production. Notably, EF-P of Actinobacteria species does not need any post-translational modification for activation. While the function and overall 3D structure of this EF-P type is conserved, the loop containing the conserved lysine is flanked by two essential prolines that rigidify it. Actinobacteria’s EF-P represents a unique subfamily that works without any modification.

Abstract: Summary
The small conductance mechanosensitive ion channel (MscS)-like (MSL) proteins in plants are evolutionarily conserved homologs of the bacterial small conductance mechanosensitive ion channels. As the sole member of the Arabidopsis MSL family localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, MSL1 is essential to maintain the normal membrane potential of mitochondria. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Arabidopsis thaliana MSL1 (AtMSL1) at 3.3 Å. The overall architecture of AtMSL1 is similar to MscS. However, the transmembrane domain of AtMSL1 is larger. Structural differences are observed in both the transmembrane and the matrix domain of AtMSL1. The carboxyl-terminus of AtMSL1 is more flexible and the β-barrel structure observed in MscS is absent. The side portals in AtMSL1 are significantly smaller, and enlarging the size of the portal by mutagenesis can increase the channel conductance. Our study provides a framework for eukaryotic MscS-like mechanosensitive ion channels and the gating mechanism of the MscS family.
