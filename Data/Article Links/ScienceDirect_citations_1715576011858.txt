Abstract: Summary
Nerve injuries cause permanent neurological disability due to limited axonal regeneration. Injury-dependent and -independent mechanisms have provided important insight into neuronal regeneration, however, common denominators underpinning regeneration remain elusive. A comparative analysis of transcriptomic datasets associated with neuronal regenerative ability revealed circadian rhythms as the most significantly enriched pathway. Subsequently, we demonstrated that sensory neurons possess an endogenous clock and that their regenerative ability displays diurnal oscillations in a murine model of sciatic nerve injury. Consistently, transcriptomic analysis showed a time-of-day-dependent enrichment for processes associated with axonal regeneration and the circadian clock. Conditional deletion experiments demonstrated that Bmal1 is required for neuronal intrinsic circadian regeneration and target re-innervation. Lastly, lithium enhanced nerve regeneration in wild-type but not in clock-deficient mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that the molecular clock fine-tunes the regenerative ability of sensory neurons and propose compounds affecting clock pathways as a novel approach to nerve repair.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control messenger RNA fate in neurons. Here, we report a mechanism that the stimuli-induced neuronal translation is mediated by phosphorylation of a YTHDF1-binding protein FMRP. Mechanistically, YTHDF1 can condense with ribosomal proteins to promote the translation of its mRNA targets. FMRP regulates this process by sequestering YTHDF1 away from the ribosome; upon neuronal stimulation, FMRP becomes phosphorylated and releases YTHDF1 for translation upregulation. We show that a new small molecule inhibitor of YTHDF1 can reverse fragile X syndrome (FXS) developmental defects associated with FMRP deficiency in an organoid model. Our study thus reveals that FMRP and its phosphorylation are important regulators of activity-dependent translation during neuronal development and stimulation and identifies YTHDF1 as a potential therapeutic target for FXS in which developmental defects caused by FMRP depletion could be reversed through YTHDF1 inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous microbial metabolite whose role in gut diseases is debated, with contradictory results stemming from experimental difficulties associated with accurate dosing and measuring H2S and the use of model systems that do not accurately represent the human gut environment. Here, we engineer Escherichia coli to titrate H2S across the physiological range in a gut microphysiological system (chip) supportive of the co-culture of microbes and host cells. The chip is engineered to maintain H2S gas tension and enables visualization of co-culture in real time with confocal microscopy. Engineered strains colonize the chip and are metabolically active for 2 days, during which they produce H2S across a 16-fold range and induce changes in host gene expression and metabolism in an H2S-concentration-dependent manner. These results validate a platform for studying the mechanisms underlying microbe-host interactions by enabling experiments that are infeasible with current animal and in vitro models.

Abstract: Summary
Deletion of the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-associated gene SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein 3 (Sapap3), which encodes a postsynaptic anchoring protein at corticostriatal synapses, causes OCD-like motor behaviors in mice. While corticostriatal synaptic dysfunction is central to this phenotype, the striatum efficiently adapts to pathological changes, often in ways that expand upon the original circuit impairment. Here, we show that SAPAP3 deletion causes non-synaptic and pathway-specific alterations in dorsolateral striatum circuit function. While somatic excitability was elevated in striatal projection neurons (SPNs), dendritic excitability was exclusively enhanced in direct pathway SPNs. Layered on top of this, cholinergic modulation was altered in opposing ways: striatal cholinergic interneuron density and evoked acetylcholine release were elevated, while basal muscarinic modulation of SPNs was reduced. These data describe how SAPAP3 deletion alters the striatal landscape upon which impaired corticostriatal inputs will act, offering a basis for how pathological synaptic integration and unbalanced striatal output underlying OCD-like behaviors may be shaped.

Abstract: Summary
Promoters are essential tools for basic and translational neuroscience research. An ideal promoter should possess the shortest possible DNA sequence with cell-type selectivity. However, whether ultra-compact promoters can offer neuron-specific expression is unclear. Here, we report the development of an extremely short promoter that enables selective gene expression in neurons, but not glial cells, in the brain. The promoter sequence originates from the human CALM1 gene and is only 120 bp in size. The CALM1 promoter (pCALM1) embedded in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome directed broad reporter expression in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mouse and monkey brains. Moreover, pCALM1, when inserted into an all-in-one AAV vector expressing SpCas9 and sgRNA, drives constitutive and conditional in vivo gene editing in neurons and elicits functional alterations. These data demonstrate the ability of pCALM1 to conduct restricted neuronal gene expression, illustrating the feasibility of ultra-miniature promoters for targeting brain-cell subtypes.

Abstract: Summary
Aerobic glycolysis is critical for cancer progression and can be exploited in cancer therapy. Here, we report that the human carboxymethylenebutenolidase homolog (carboxymethylenebutenolidase-like [CMBL]) acts as a tumor suppressor by reprogramming glycolysis in colorectal cancer (CRC). The anti-cancer action of CMBL is mediated through its interactions with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 and the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 platelet type (PFKP). Ectopic CMBL enhances TRIM25 binding to PFKP, leading to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of PFKP. Interestingly, CMBL is transcriptionally activated by p53 in response to genotoxic stress, and p53 activation represses glycolysis by promoting PFKP degradation. Remarkably, CMBL deficiency, which impairs p53’s ability to inhibit glycolysis, makes tumors more sensitive to a combination therapy involving the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose. Taken together, our study demonstrates that CMBL suppresses CRC growth by inhibiting glycolysis and suggests a potential combination strategy for the treatment of CMBL-deficient CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies of the murine Ly49 and human KIR gene clusters implicated competing sense and antisense promoters in the control of variegated gene expression. In the current study, an examination of transcription factor genes defines an abundance of convergent and divergent sense/antisense promoter pairs, suggesting that competing promoters may control cell fate determination. Differentiation of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors in vitro shows that cells with GATA1 antisense transcription have enhanced GATA2 transcription and a mast cell phenotype, whereas cells with GATA2 antisense transcription have increased GATA1 transcripts and an erythroblast phenotype. Detailed analyses of the AHR and RORC genes demonstrate the ability of competing promoters to act as binary switches and the association of antisense transcription with an immature/progenitor cell phenotype. These data indicate that alternative cell fates generated by promoter competition in lineage-determining transcription factors contribute to the programming of cell differentiation.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the protective effects of Ferulago angulata extract (FAE) against the reproductive toxicants Diazinon (DZN) and Lead (Pb) in mice. These pollutants are known to induce oxidative stress (OS), while FAE acts as a natural antioxidant. Adult male NMRI mice were exposed to DZN, Pb, and DZN+Pb, with or without FAE treatment for six weeks. We evaluated OS markers, testicular histology, and expression of mRNA related to enzymatic antioxidants. Exposure to DZN and Pb led to increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and nitric oxide (NO) in the testes, along with a decrease in the total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was altered. However, when FAE was administered concurrently, it restored the biochemical parameters to normal levels, reduced the toxic effects of DZN and Pb, and provided protection against testicular histopathological injury. These findings suggest that FAE has the potential to serve as a protective agent against oxidative damage caused by contaminants in reproductive organs, specifically in the testes.

Abstract: Summary
Myofibroblasts are responsible for scarring during fibrosis. The scar propagates mechanical signals inducing a radical transformation in myofibroblast cell state and increasing profibrotic phenotype. Here, we show mechanical stress from progressive scarring induces nuclear softening and de-repression of heterochromatin. The parallel loss of H3K9Me3 enables a permissive state for distinct chromatin accessibility and profibrotic gene regulation. Integrating chromatin accessibility profiles with RNA expression provides insight into the transcription network underlying the switch in profibrotic myofibroblast states, emphasizing mechanoadaptive regulation of PAK1 as key drivers. Through genetic manipulation in liver and lung fibrosis, loss of PAK1-dependent signaling impairs the mechanoadaptive response in vitro and dramatically improves fibrosis in vivo. Moreover, we provide human validation for mechanisms underpinning PAK1-mediated mechanotransduction in liver and lung fibrosis. Collectively, these observations provide insight into the nuclear mechanics driving the profibrotic chromatin landscape in fibrosis, highlighting actomyosin-dependent mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets in fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal increases in cell size are associated with senescence and cell cycle exit. The mechanisms by which overgrowth primes cells to withdraw from the cell cycle remain unknown. We address this question using CDK4/6 inhibitors, which arrest cells in G0/G1 and are licensed to treat advanced HR+/HER2− breast cancer. We demonstrate that CDK4/6-inhibited cells overgrow during G0/G1, causing p38/p53/p21-dependent cell cycle withdrawal. Cell cycle withdrawal is triggered by biphasic p21 induction. The first p21 wave is caused by osmotic stress, leading to p38- and size-dependent accumulation of p21. CDK4/6 inhibitor washout results in some cells entering S-phase. Overgrown cells experience replication stress, resulting in a second p21 wave that promotes cell cycle withdrawal from G2 or the subsequent G1. We propose that the levels of p21 integrate signals from overgrowth-triggered stresses to determine cell fate. This model explains how hypertrophy can drive senescence and why CDK4/6 inhibitors have long-lasting effects in patients.

Abstract: Summary
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110α is an essential mediator of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. We interrogated the human serine, threonine, and tyrosine kinome to search for novel regulators of p110α and found that the Hippo kinases phosphorylate p110α at T1061, which inhibits its activity. This inhibitory state corresponds to a conformational change of a membrane-binding domain on p110α, which impairs its ability to engage membranes. In human primary hepatocytes, cancer cell lines, and rodent tissues, activation of the Hippo kinases MST1/2 using forskolin or epinephrine is associated with phosphorylation of T1061 and inhibition of p110α, impairment of downstream insulin signaling, and suppression of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. These changes are abrogated when MST1/2 are genetically deleted or inhibited with small molecules or if the T1061 is mutated to alanine. Our study defines an inhibitory pathway of PI3K signaling and a link between epinephrine and insulin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy/autophagy plays a pivotal role in immune regulation. Its significance is evident in modulation of immune cell differentiation and maturation, physiologically and pathologically. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage autophagy on the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). By employing an MC903-induced AD mice model, we observe reduced cutaneous inflammation in macrophage Atg5 cKO mice compared with WT mice. Notably, there is a decreased infiltration of M2 macrophages in lesional skin from Atg5 cKO mice. Furthermore, impaired STAT6 phosphorylation and diminished expression of M2 markers are detected in autophagy-deficient macrophages. Our mechanistic exploration reveals that CEBPB drives the transcription of SOCS1/3 and SQSTM1/p62-mediated autophagy degrades CEBPB normally. Autophagy deficiency leads to CEBPB accumulation, and further promotes the expression of SOCS1/3. This process inhibits JAK1-STAT6 pathway activation and M2 marker expression. Together, our study indicates that autophagy is required for M2 activation and macrophage autophagy may be a promising target for AD intervention.

Abstract: Summary
The lung contains multiple progenitor cell types, but how their responses are choreographed during injury repair and whether this changes with age is poorly understood. We report that histone H3 lysine 9 di-methylation (H3K9me2), mediated by the methyltransferase G9a, regulates the dynamics of distal lung epithelial progenitor cells and that this regulation deteriorates with age. In aged mouse lungs, H3K9me2 loss coincided with fewer alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell progenitors and reduced alveolar regeneration but increased the frequency and activity of multipotent bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) and bronchiolar progenitor club cells. H3K9me2 depletion in young mice decreased AT2 progenitor activity and impaired alveolar injury repair. Conversely, H3K9me2 depletion increased chromatin accessibility of bronchiolar cell genes, increased BASC frequency, and accelerated bronchiolar cell injury repair. These findings indicate that during aging, the epigenetic regulation that coordinates lung progenitor cells’ regenerative responses becomes dysregulated, aiding our understanding of age-related susceptibility to lung disease.

Abstract: Summary
Branching allows neurons to make synaptic contacts with large numbers of other neurons, facilitating the high connectivity of nervous systems. Neuronal arbors have geometric properties such as branch lengths and diameters that are optimal in that they maximize signaling speeds while minimizing construction costs. In this work, we asked whether neuronal arbors have topological properties that may also optimize their growth or function. We discovered that for a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate neurons the distributions of their subtree sizes follow power laws, implying that they are scale invariant. The power-law exponent distinguishes different neuronal cell types. Postsynaptic spines and branchlets perturb scale invariance. Through simulations, we show that the subtree-size distribution depends on the symmetry of the branching rules governing arbor growth and that optimal morphologies are scale invariant. Thus, the subtree-size distribution is a topological property that recapitulates the functional morphology of dendrites.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive aldehydes are produced by normal cellular metabolism or after alcohol consumption, and they accumulate in human tissues if aldehyde clearance mechanisms are impaired. Their toxicity has been attributed to the damage they cause to genomic DNA and the subsequent inhibition of transcription and replication. However, whether interference with other cellular processes contributes to aldehyde toxicity has not been investigated. We demonstrate that formaldehyde induces RNA-protein crosslinks (RPCs) that stall the ribosome and inhibit translation in human cells. RPCs in the messenger RNA (mRNA) are recognized by the translating ribosomes, marked by atypical K6-linked ubiquitylation catalyzed by the RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3 ligase RNF14, and subsequently resolved by the ubiquitin- and ATP-dependent unfoldase VCP. Our findings uncover an evolutionary conserved formaldehyde-induced stress response pathway that protects cells against RPC accumulation in the cytoplasm, and they suggest that RPCs contribute to the cellular and tissue toxicity of reactive aldehydes.

Abstract: Summary
PRMT1 plays a vital role in breast tumorigenesis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Herein, we show that PRMT1 plays a critical role in RNA alternative splicing, with a preference for exon inclusion. PRMT1 methylome profiling identifies that PRMT1 methylates the splicing factor SRSF1, which is critical for SRSF1 phosphorylation, SRSF1 binding with RNA, and exon inclusion. In breast tumors, PRMT1 overexpression is associated with increased SRSF1 arginine methylation and aberrant exon inclusion, which are critical for breast cancer cell growth. In addition, we identify a selective PRMT1 inhibitor, iPRMT1, which potently inhibits PRMT1-mediated SRSF1 methylation, exon inclusion, and breast cancer cell growth. Combination treatment with iPRMT1 and inhibitors targeting SRSF1 phosphorylation exhibits an additive effect of suppressing breast cancer cell growth. In conclusion, our study dissects a mechanism underlying PRMT1-mediated RNA alternative splicing. Thus, PRMT1 has great potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The inheritance of a functional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is ensured by the ER stress surveillance (ERSU) pathway. Here, we made the unexpected discovery that reticulon 1 (Rtn1) and Yop1, well-known ER-curvature-generating proteins, each possess two sphingolipid-binding motifs within their transmembrane domains and that these motifs recognize the ER-stress-induced sphingolipid phytosphingosine (PHS), resulting in an ER inheritance block. Upon binding PHS, Rtn1/Yop1 accumulate on the ER tubule, poised to enter the emerging daughter cell, and cause its misdirection to the bud scars (i.e., previous cell division sites). Amino acid changes in the conserved PHS-binding motifs preclude Rtn1 or Yop1 from binding PHS and diminish their enrichment on the tubular ER, ultimately preventing the ER-stress-induced inheritance block. Conservation of these sphingolipid-binding motifs in human reticulons suggests that sphingolipid binding to Rtn1 and Yop1 represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that enables cells to respond to ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), renal cyst lesions predominantly arise from collecting ducts (CDs). However, relevant CD cyst models using human cells are lacking. Although previous reports have generated in vitro renal tubule cyst models from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), therapeutic drug candidates for ADPKD have not been identified. Here, by establishing expansion cultures of hiPSC-derived ureteric bud tip cells, an embryonic precursor that gives rise to CDs, we succeed in advancing the developmental stage of CD organoids and show that all CD organoids derived from PKD1−/− hiPSCs spontaneously develop multiple cysts, clarifying the initiation mechanisms of cystogenesis. Moreover, we identify retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonists as candidate drugs that suppress in vitro cystogenesis and confirm the therapeutic effects on an ADPKD mouse model in vivo. Therefore, our in vitro CD cyst model contributes to understanding disease mechanisms and drug discovery for ADPKD.

Abstract: Summary
In the retina, rod and cone pathways mediate visual signals over a billion-fold range in luminance. AII (“A-two”) amacrine cells (ACs) receive signals from both pathways via different bipolar cells, enabling AIIs to operate at night and during the day. Previous work has examined luminance-dependent changes in AII gap junction connectivity, but less is known about how surrounding circuitry shapes AII receptive fields across light levels. Here, we report that moderate contrast stimuli elicit surround inhibition in AIIs under all but the dimmest visual conditions, due to actions of horizontal cells and at least two ACs that inhibit presynaptic bipolar cells. Under photopic (daylight) conditions, surround inhibition transforms AII response kinetics, which are inherited by downstream ganglion cells. Ablating neuronal nitric oxide synthase type-1 (nNOS-1) ACs removes AII surround inhibition under mesopic (dusk/dawn), but not photopic, conditions. Our findings demonstrate how multiple layers of neural circuitry interact to encode signals across a wide physiological range.

Abstract: Summary
Biallelic mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) cause a rare disease with multi-symptomatic features including developmental delay, intellectual disability, neuropathy, and seizures. NGLY1’s activity in human neural cells is currently not well understood. To understand how NGLY1 gene loss leads to the specific phenotypes of NGLY1 deficiency, we employed direct conversion of NGLY1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to functional cortical neurons. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional studies of iPSC-derived neurons lacking NGLY1 function revealed several major cellular processes that were altered, including protein aggregate-clearing functionality, mitochondrial homeostasis, and synaptic dysfunctions. These phenotypes were rescued by introduction of a functional NGLY1 gene and were observed in iPSC-derived mature neurons but not astrocytes. Finally, laser capture microscopy followed by mass spectrometry provided detailed characterization of the composition of protein aggregates specific to NGLY1-deficient neurons. Future studies will harness this knowledge for therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain malignancy. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) have attracted interest for their potential as treatment targets. Here, we show that CD97 (ADGRE5) is the most promising aGPCR target in GBM, by virtue of its de novo expression compared to healthy brain tissue. CD97 knockdown or knockout significantly reduces the tumor initiation capacity of patient-derived GBM cultures (PDGCs) in vitro and in vivo. We find that CD97 promotes glycolytic metabolism via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which depends on phosphorylation of its C terminus and recruitment of β-arrestin. We also demonstrate that THY1/CD90 is a likely CD97 ligand in GBM. Lastly, we show that an anti-CD97 antibody-drug conjugate selectively kills tumor cells in vitro. Our studies identify CD97 as a regulator of tumor metabolism, elucidate mechanisms of receptor activation and signaling, and provide strong scientific rationale for developing biologics to target it therapeutically in GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Our previous work has established a knockin (KI) pig model of Huntington’s disease (HD) that can replicate the typical pathological features of HD, including selective striatal neuronal loss, reactive gliosis, and axonal degeneration. However, HD KI mice exhibit milder neuropathological phenotypes and lack overt neurodegeneration. By performing RNA sequencing to compare the gene expression profiles between HD KI pigs and mice, we find that genes related to interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling are upregulated in the HD pig brains compared to the mouse brains. Delivery of IL-17 into the brain striatum of HD KI mice causes greater reactive gliosis and synaptic deficiency compared to HD KI mice that received PBS. These findings suggest that the upregulation of genes related to IL-17 signaling in HD pig brains contributes to severe glial pathology in HD and identify this as a potential therapeutic target for treating HD.

Abstract: Summary
Appropriate histone modifications emerge as essential cell fate regulators of neuronal identities across neocortical areas and layers. Here we showed that NSD1, the methyltransferase for di-methylated lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me2), controls both area and layer identities of the neocortex. Nsd1-ablated neocortex showed an area shift of all four primary functional regions and aberrant wiring of cortico-thalamic-cortical projections. Nsd1 conditional knockout mice displayed defects in spatial memory, motor learning, and coordination, resembling patients with the Sotos syndrome carrying NSD1 mutations. On Nsd1 loss, superficial-layer pyramidal neurons (PNs) progressively mis-expressed markers for deep-layer PNs, and PNs remained immature both morphologically and electrophysiologically. Loss of Nsd1 in postmitotic PNs causes genome-wide loss of H3K36me2 and re-distribution of DNA methylation, which accounts for diminished expression of neocortical layer specifiers but ectopic expression of non-neural genes. Together, H3K36me2 mediated by NSD1 is required for the establishment and maintenance of region- and layer-specific neocortical identities.

Abstract: Summary
During meiosis, the chromatin and transcriptome undergo prominent switches. Although recent studies have explored the genome reorganization during spermatogenesis, the chromatin remodeling in oogenesis and characteristics of homologous pairing remain largely elusive. We comprehensively compared chromatin structures and transcriptomes at successive substages of meiotic prophase in both female and male mice using low-input high-through chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) gradually disappeared and slowly recovered in both sexes. We found that homologs adopted different sex-conserved pairing strategies prior to and after the leptotene-to-zygotene transition, changing from long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-enriched compartments B to short interspersed nuclear element (SINE)-enriched compartments A. We complemented marker genes and predicted the sex-specific meiotic sterile genes for each substage. This study provides valuable insights into the similarities and distinctions between sexes in chromosome architecture, homologous pairing, and transcriptome during meiotic prophase of both oogenesis and spermatogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Response to threatening environmental stimuli requires detection and encoding of important environmental features that dictate threat. Aversive events are highly salient, which promotes associative learning about stimuli that signal this threat. The nucleus accumbens is uniquely positioned to process this salient, aversive information and promote motivated output, through plasticity on the major projection neurons in the brain area. We describe a nucleus accumbens core local circuit whereby excitatory plasticity facilitates learning and recall of discrete aversive cues. We demonstrate that putative nucleus accumbens substance P release and long-term excitatory plasticity on dopamine 2 receptor-expressing projection neurons are required for cue-dependent fear learning. Additionally, we find that fear learning and recall is dependent on distinct projection neuron subtypes. Our work demonstrates a critical role for nucleus accumbens substance P in cue-dependent aversive learning.

Abstract: Summary
Modulation of large conductance intracellular ligand-activated potassium (BK) channel family (Slo1–3) by auxiliary subunits allows diverse physiological functions in excitable and non-excitable cells. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel complexes have provided insights into how voltage sensitivity is modulated by auxiliary subunits. However, the modulation mechanisms of BK channels, particularly as ligand-activated ion channels, remain unknown. Slo1 is a Ca2+-activated and voltage-gated BK channel and is expressed in neurons, muscle cells, and epithelial cells. Using cryo-EM and electrophysiology, we show that the LRRC26-γ1 subunit modulates not only voltage but also Ca2+ sensitivity of Homo sapiens Slo1. LRRC26 stabilizes the active conformation of voltage-senor domains of Slo1 by an extracellularly S4-locking mechanism. Furthermore, it also stabilizes the active conformation of Ca2+-sensor domains of Slo1 intracellularly, which is functionally equivalent to intracellular Ca2+ in the activation of Slo1. Such a dual allosteric modulatory mechanism may be general in regulating the intracellular ligand-activated BK channel complexes.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with mRNA to form supramolecular complexes called messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles. These dynamic assemblies direct and regulate individual steps of gene expression; however, their composition and functional importance remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a total internal reflection fluorescence-based single-molecule imaging assay to investigate stoichiometry and co-occupancy of 15 RBPs within mRNPs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show compositional heterogeneity of single mRNPs and plasticity across different growth conditions, with major co-occupants of mRNPs containing the nuclear cap-binding complex identified as Yra1 (1–10 copies), Nab2 (1–6 copies), and Npl3 (1–6 copies). Multicopy Yra1-bound mRNPs are specifically co-occupied by the THO complex and assembled on mRNAs biased by transcript length and RNA secondary structure. Yra1 depletion results in decreased compaction of nuclear mRNPs demonstrating a packaging function. Together, we provide a quantitative framework for gene- and condition-dependent RBP occupancy and stoichiometry in individual nuclear mRNPs.

Abstract: Summary
Paclitaxel leads to peripheral neuropathy (paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy [PIPN]) in approximately 50% of cancer patients. At present, there are no effective treatment strategies for PIPN, the mechanisms of which also remain unclear. In this study, we performed microbiome and metabolome analysis of feces and serum from breast cancer patients with different PIPN grades due to paclitaxel treatment. Our analysis reveals that levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA) are highly increased because of ingrowth of Clostridium species, which is associated with severe neuropathy. DCA, in turn, elevates serum level of C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5) and induces CCL5 receptor 5 (CCR5) overexpression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) through the bile acid receptor Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), contributing to neuronal hyperexcitability. Consistent with this, administration of CCR5 antagonist maraviroc suppresses the development of neuropathic nociception. These results implicate gut microbiota/bile acids/CCR5 signaling in the induction of PIPN, thus suggesting a target for PIPN treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription of tRNA genes by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) is tuned by signaling cascades. The emerging notion of differential tRNA gene regulation implies the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. However, tRNA gene-specific regulators have not been described. Decoding the local chromatin proteome of a native tRNA gene in yeast revealed reprogramming of the RNAPIII transcription machinery upon nutrient perturbation. Among the dynamic proteins, we identified Fpt1, a protein of unknown function that uniquely occupied RNAPIII-regulated genes. Fpt1 binding at tRNA genes correlated with the efficiency of RNAPIII eviction upon nutrient perturbation and required the transcription factors TFIIIB and TFIIIC but not RNAPIII. In the absence of Fpt1, eviction of RNAPIII was reduced, and the shutdown of ribosome biogenesis genes was impaired upon nutrient perturbation. Our findings provide support for a chromatin-associated mechanism required for RNAPIII eviction from tRNA genes and tuning the physiological response to changing metabolic demands.

Abstract: Summary
Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pAML) is characterized by heterogeneous cellular composition, driver alterations and prognosis. Characterization of this heterogeneity and how it affects treatment response remains understudied in pediatric patients. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell ATAC sequencing to profile 28 patients representing different pAML subtypes at diagnosis, remission and relapse. At diagnosis, cellular composition differed between genetic subgroups. Upon relapse, cellular hierarchies transitioned toward a more primitive state regardless of subtype. Primitive cells in the relapsed tumor were distinct compared to cells at diagnosis, with under-representation of myeloid transcriptional programs and over-representation of other lineage programs. In some patients, this was accompanied by the appearance of a B-lymphoid-like hierarchy. Our data thus reveal the emergence of apparent subtype-specific plasticity upon treatment and inform on potentially targetable processes.

Abstract: Summary
Misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins are degraded through a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Soluble, lumenal ERAD targets are recognized, retrotranslocated across the ER membrane, ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome using an ERAD pathway containing a ubiquitin ligase called Hrd1. To determine how Hrd1 mediates these processes, we developed a deep mutational scanning approach to identify residues involved in Hrd1 function, including those exclusively required for lumenal degradation. We identify several regions required for different Hrd1 functions. Most surprisingly, we find two cytosolic regions of Hrd1 required for lumenal ERAD substrate degradation. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we define roles for disordered regions between structural elements that are required for Hrd1 autoubiquitination and substrate interaction. Our results demonstrate that disordered cytosolic regions promote substrate retrotranslocation by controlling Hrd1 activation and establishing directionality of retrotranslocation for lumenal substrate across the ER membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetic chromosome engineering is a complex process due to the need to identify and repair growth defects and deal with combinatorial gene essentiality when rearranging chromosomes. To alleviate these issues, we have demonstrated novel approaches for repairing and rearranging synthetic Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes. We have designed, constructed, and restored wild-type fitness to a synthetic 753,096-bp version of S. cerevisiae chromosome XIV as part of the Synthetic Yeast Genome project. In parallel to the use of rational engineering approaches to restore wild-type fitness, we used adaptive laboratory evolution to generate a general growth-defect-suppressor rearrangement in the form of increased TAR1 copy number. We also extended the utility of the synthetic chromosome recombination and modification by loxPsym-mediated evolution (SCRaMbLE) system by engineering synthetic-wild-type tetraploid hybrid strains that buffer against essential gene loss, highlighting the plasticity of the S. cerevisiae genome in the presence of rational and non-rational modifications.

Abstract: Summary
Most epithelial tissues are maintained by stem cells that produce the different cell lineages required for proper tissue function. Constant communication between different cell types ensures precise regulation of stem cell behavior and cell fate decisions. These cell-cell interactions are often disrupted during tumorigenesis, but mechanisms by which they are co-opted to support tumor growth in different genetic contexts are poorly understood. Here, we introduce PromoterSwitch, a genetic platform we established to generate large, transformed clones derived from individual adult Drosophila intestinal stem/progenitor cells. We show that cancer-driving genetic alterations representing common colon tumor genome landscapes disrupt cell fate decisions within transformed tissue and result in the emergence of abnormal cell fates. We also show that transformed enteroendocrine cells, a differentiated, hormone-secreting cell lineage, support tumor growth by regulating intestinal stem cell proliferation through multiple genotype-dependent mechanisms, which represent potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The temporal cortex represents social stimuli, including bodies. We examine and compare the contributions of dynamic and static features to the single-unit responses to moving monkey bodies in and between a patch in the anterior dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus (dorsal patch [DP]) and patches in the anterior inferotemporal cortex (ventral patch [VP]), using fMRI guidance in macaques. The response to dynamics varies within both regions, being higher in DP. The dynamic body selectivity of VP neurons correlates with static features derived from convolutional neural networks and motion. DP neurons’ dynamic body selectivity is not predicted by static features but is dominated by motion. Whereas these data support the dominance of motion in the newly proposed “dynamic social perception” stream, they challenge the traditional view that distinguishes DP and VP processing in terms of motion versus static features, underscoring the role of inferotemporal neurons in representing body dynamics.

Abstract: The mycomembrane (MM) is a mycolic acid layer covering the surface of Mycobacteria and related species. This group includes important pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, but also the biotechnologically important strain Corynebacterium glutamicum. Biosynthesis of the MM is an attractive target for antibiotic intervention. The first line anti-tuberculosis drug ethambutol (EMB) and the new drug candidate, benzothiazinone 043 (BTZ) interfere with the synthesis of the arabinogalactan (AG), which is a structural scaffold for covalently attached mycolic acids that form the inner leaflet of the MM. We previously showed that C. glutamicum cells treated with a sublethal concentration of EMB lose the integrity of the MM. In this study we examined the effects of BTZ on the cell envelope. Our work shows that BTZ efficiently blocks the apical growth machinery, however effects in combinatorial treatment with β-lactam antibiotics are only additive, not synergistic. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed a distinct middle layer in the septum of control cells considered to be the inner leaflet of the MM covalently attached to the AG. This layer was not detectable in the septa of BTZ or EMB treated cells. In addition, we observed that EMB treated cells have a thicker and less electron dense peptidoglycan (PG). While EMB and BTZ both effectively block elongation growth, BTZ also strongly reduces septal cell wall synthesis, slowing down growth effectively. This renders BTZ treated cells likely more tolerant to antibiotics that act on growing bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal ribbon synapses undergo functional changes after eye opening that remain uncharacterized. Using light-flash stimulation and paired patch-clamp recordings, we examined the maturation of the ribbon synapse between rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and AII-amacrine cells (AII-ACs) after eye opening (postnatal day 14) in the mouse retina at near physiological temperatures. We find that light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in AII-ACs exhibit a slow sustained component that increases in magnitude with advancing age, whereas a fast transient component remains unchanged. Similarly, paired recordings reveal a dual-component EPSC with a slower sustained component that increases during development, even though the miniature EPSC (mEPSC) amplitude and kinetics do not change significantly. We thus propose that the readily releasable pool of vesicles from RBCs increases after eye opening, and we estimate that a short light flash can evoke the release of ∼4,000 vesicles onto a single mature AII-AC.

Abstract: Summary
The multi-pass transmembrane protein ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) is an immune regulator in Arabidopsis thaliana with an unclear biochemical mode of action. We have identified two loci, MODULATOR OF HYPERACTIVE ACD6 1 (MHA1) and its paralog MHA1-LIKE (MHA1L), that code for ∼7 kDa proteins, which differentially interact with specific ACD6 variants. MHA1L enhances the accumulation of an ACD6 complex, thereby increasing the activity of the ACD6 standard allele for regulating plant growth and defenses. The intracellular ankyrin repeats of ACD6 are structurally similar to those found in mammalian ion channels. Several lines of evidence link increased ACD6 activity to enhanced calcium influx, with MHA1L as a direct regulator of ACD6, indicating that peptide-regulated ion channels are not restricted to animals.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic copy number gains are pervasive across cancer types, yet their roles in oncogenesis are insufficiently evaluated. This inadequacy is partly due to copy gains spanning large chromosomal regions, obscuring causal loci. Here, we employed organoid modeling to evaluate candidate oncogenic loci identified via integrative computational analysis of extreme copy gains overlapping with extreme expression dysregulation in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Subsets of “outlier” candidates were contextually screened as tissue-specific cDNA lentiviral libraries within cognate esophagus, oral cavity, colon, stomach, pancreas, and lung organoids bearing initial oncogenic mutations. Iterative analysis nominated the kinase DYRK2 at 12q15 as an amplified head and neck squamous carcinoma oncogene in p53−/− oral mucosal organoids. Similarly, FGF3, amplified at 11q13 in 41% of esophageal squamous carcinomas, promoted p53−/− esophageal organoid growth reversible by small molecule and soluble receptor antagonism of FGFRs. Our studies establish organoid-based contextual screening of candidate genomic drivers, enabling functional evaluation during early tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-suppressive cell competition (TSCC) is a conserved surveillance mechanism in which neighboring cells actively eliminate oncogenic cells. Despite overwhelming studies showing that the unfolded protein response (UPR) is dysregulated in various tumors, it remains debatable whether the UPR restrains or promotes tumorigenesis. Here, using Drosophila eye epithelium as a model, we uncover a surprising decisive role of the Ire1 branch of the UPR in regulating cell polarity gene scribble (scrib) loss-induced TSCC. Both mutation and hyperactivation of Ire1 accelerate elimination of scrib clones via inducing apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. Unexpectedly, relative Ire1 activity is also crucial for determining loser cell fate, as dysregulating Ire1 signaling in the surrounding healthy cells reversed the “loser” status of scrib clones by decreasing their apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Ire1 is required for cell competition in mammalian cells. Together, these findings provide molecular insights into scrib-mediated TSCC and highlight Ire1 as a key determinant of loser cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Depletion of CD8+ T cells is a major obstacle in immunotherapy; however, the relevant mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that prostate cancer (PCa) cell-derived exosomes hamper CD8+ T cell function by transporting interleukin-8 (IL-8). Compared to the low IL-8 levels detected in immune cells, PCa cells secreted the abundance of IL-8 and further accumulated in exosomes. The delivery of PCa cell-derived exosomes into CD8+ T cells exhausted the cells through enhanced starvation. Mechanistically, exosomal IL-8 overactivated PPARα in recipient cells, thereby decreasing glucose utilization by downregulating GLUT1 and HK2 but increasing fatty acid catabolism via upregulation of CPT1A and ACOX1. PPARα further activates uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), leading to fatty acid catabolism for thermogenesis rather than ATP synthesis. Consequently, inhibition of PPARα and UCP1 restores CD8+ T cell proliferation by counteracting the effect of exosomal IL-8. This study revealed that the tumor exosome-activated IL-8-PPARα-UCP1 axis harms tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells by interfering with energy metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Circuit refinement involves the formation of new presynaptic boutons as others are dismantled. Nascent presynaptic sites can incorporate material from recently eliminated synapses, but the recycling mechanisms remain elusive. In early-stage C. elegans larvae, the presynaptic boutons of GABAergic DD neurons are removed and new outputs established at alternative sites. Here, we show that developmentally regulated expression of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) UNC-8 in remodeling DD neurons promotes a Ca2+ and actin-dependent mechanism, involving activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE), that recycles presynaptic material for reassembly at nascent DD synapses. ADBE normally functions in highly active neurons to accelerate local recycling of synaptic vesicles. In contrast, we find that an ADBE-like mechanism results in the distal recycling of synaptic material from old to new synapses. Thus, our findings suggest that a native mechanism (ADBE) can be repurposed to dismantle presynaptic terminals for reassembly at new, distant locations.

Abstract: Summary
Relating genetic variants to behavior remains a fundamental challenge. To assess the utility of DNA methylation marks in discovering causative variants, we examined their relationship to genetic variation by generating single-nucleus methylomes from the hippocampus of eight inbred mouse strains. At CpG sequence densities under 40 CpG/Kb, cells compensate for loss of methylated sites by methylating additional sites to maintain methylation levels. At higher CpG sequence densities, the exact location of a methylated site becomes more important, suggesting that variants affecting methylation will have a greater effect when occurring in higher CpG densities than in lower. We found this to be true for a variant’s effect on transcript abundance, indicating that candidate variants can be prioritized based on CpG sequence density. Our findings imply that DNA methylation influences the likelihood that mutations occur at specific sites in the genome, supporting the view that the distribution of mutations is not random.

Abstract: Summary
H3K9 methylation (H3K9me) marks transcriptionally silent genomic regions called heterochromatin. HP1 proteins are required to establish and maintain heterochromatin. HP1 proteins bind to H3K9me, recruit factors that promote heterochromatin formation, and oligomerize to form phase-separated condensates. We do not understand how these different HP1 properties are involved in establishing and maintaining transcriptional silencing. Here, we demonstrate that the S. pombe HP1 homolog, Swi6, can be completely bypassed to establish silencing at ectopic and endogenous loci when an H3K4 methyltransferase, Set1, and an H3K14 acetyltransferase, Mst2, are deleted. Deleting Set1 and Mst2 enhances Clr4 enzymatic activity, leading to higher H3K9me levels and spreading. In contrast, Swi6 and its capacity to oligomerize were indispensable during epigenetic maintenance. Our results demonstrate the role of HP1 proteins in regulating histone modification crosstalk during establishment and identify a genetically separable function in maintaining epigenetic memory.

Abstract: Summary
Senescent cells are a major contributor to age-dependent cardiovascular tissue dysfunction, but knowledge of their in vivo cell markers and tissue context is lacking. To reveal tissue-relevant senescence biology, we integrate the transcriptomes of 10 experimental senescence cell models with a 224 multi-tissue gene co-expression network based on RNA-seq data of seven tissues biopsies from ∼600 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. We identify 56 senescence-associated modules, many enriched in CAD GWAS genes and correlated with cardiometabolic traits—which supports universality of senescence gene programs across tissues and in CAD. Cross-tissue network analyses reveal 86 candidate senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, including COL6A3. Experimental knockdown of COL6A3 induces transcriptional changes that overlap the majority of the experimental senescence models, with cell-cycle arrest linked to modulation of DREAM complex-targeted genes. We provide a transcriptomic resource for cellular senescence and identify candidate biomarkers, SASP factors, and potential drivers of senescence in human tissues.

Abstract: Summary
The peripheral nervous system harbors a remarkable potential to regenerate after acute nerve trauma. Full functional recovery, however, is rare and critically depends on peripheral nerve Schwann cells that orchestrate breakdown and resynthesis of myelin and, at the same time, support axonal regrowth. How Schwann cells meet the high metabolic demand required for nerve repair remains poorly understood. We here report that nerve injury induces adipocyte to glial signaling and identify the adipokine leptin as an upstream regulator of glial metabolic adaptation in regeneration. Signal integration by leptin receptors in Schwann cells ensures efficient peripheral nerve repair by adjusting injury-specific catabolic processes in regenerating nerves, including myelin autophagy and mitochondrial respiration. Our findings propose a model according to which acute nerve injury triggers a therapeutically targetable intercellular crosstalk that modulates glial metabolism to provide sufficient energy for successful nerve repair.

Abstract: Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are a family of hyperglycosylated hydroxyproline-rich cell wall proteins found throughout the plant kingdom. To date, eight Hydroxyproline-galactosyltransferases (Hyp-GALTs), named GALT2-GALT9, are known to catalyze the addition of the first galactose sugar to Hyp residues in AGP protein cores. The generation and characterization of galt23456789 octuple mutants using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology, provided strong reverse genetic evidence that AG glycans are essential for normal vegetative and reproductive growth, as these mutants demonstrated stunted growth, greatly delayed flowering and significant defects in floral organ development and morphogenesis. Compared to the lower seed set of galt25789 quintuple mutants being more so contributed by female gametophytic defects, dramatically low seed-set of octuple mutants was largely due to impaired male reproductive function, specifically due to shorter filaments, delayed anther dehiscence, and large decreases in pollen quantity and viability. Octuple mutant pollen had severely distorted reticulate exine, tectum patterning and intine thickness. Reduced amounts of galactose and arabinose in overall lower amounts of β-Yariv precipitated AGPs illustrated how biological functions of AGPs are affected by abnormal glycosylation.

Abstract: Summary
Low-protein diets promote health and longevity in diverse species. Restriction of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine recapitulates many of these benefits in young C57BL/6J mice. Restriction of dietary isoleucine (IleR) is sufficient to promote metabolic health and is required for many benefits of a low-protein diet in C57BL/6J males. Here, we test the hypothesis that IleR will promote healthy aging in genetically heterogeneous adult UM-HET3 mice. We find that IleR improves metabolic health in young and old HET3 mice, promoting leanness and glycemic control in both sexes, and reprograms hepatic metabolism in a sex-specific manner. IleR reduces frailty and extends the lifespan of male and female mice, but to a greater degree in males. Our results demonstrate that IleR increases healthspan and longevity in genetically diverse mice and suggests that IleR, or pharmaceuticals that mimic this effect, may have potential as a geroprotective intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Grain number and size determine grain yield in crops and are closely associated with spikelet fertility and grain filling in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Abortion of spikelet primordia within individual barley spikes causes a 30%–50% loss in the potential number of grains during development from the awn primordium stage to the tipping stage, after that grain filling is the primary factor regulating grain size. To identify transcriptional signatures associated with spike development, we use a six-rowed barley cultivar (Morex) to develop a spatiotemporal transcriptome atlas containing 255 samples covering 17 stages and 5 positions along the spike. We identify several fundamental regulatory networks, in addition to key regulators of spike development and morphology. Specifically, we show HvGELP96, encoding a GDSL domain-containing protein, as a regulator of spikelet fertility and grain number. Our transcriptional atlas offers a powerful resource to answer fundamental questions in spikelet development and degeneration in barley.

Abstract: Summary
How dedifferentiated stem-like tumor cells evade immunosurveillance remains poorly understood. We show that the lineage-plasticity regulator SOX9, which is upregulated in dedifferentiated tumor cells, limits the number of infiltrating T lymphocytes in premalignant lesions of mouse basal-like breast cancer. SOX9-mediated immunosuppression is required for the progression of in situ tumors to invasive carcinoma. SOX9 induces the expression of immune checkpoint B7x/B7-H4 through STAT3 activation and direct transcriptional regulation. B7x is upregulated in dedifferentiated tumor cells and protects them from immunosurveillance. B7x also protects mammary gland regeneration in immunocompetent mice. In advanced tumors, B7x targeting inhibits tumor growth and overcomes resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. In human breast cancer, SOX9 and B7x expression are correlated and associated with reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. This study, using mouse models, cell lines, and patient samples, identifies a dedifferentiation-associated immunosuppression mechanism and demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting the SOX9-B7x pathway in basal-like breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a major feature of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). None of the drugs targeting the catalytic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in the DNL process, have been approved by the FDA. Whether cytosolic ACC1 can be regulated spatially remains to be explored. Herein, we find that streptavidin (SA), which is a bacterium-derived tetrameric protein, forms cytosolic condensates and efficiently induces a spatial re-localization of ACC1 in liver cells, concomitant with inhibited lipid accumulation. Both SA tetrameric structure and multivalent protein interaction are required for condensate formation. Interestingly, the condensates are further characterized as gel-like membraneless organelle (SAGMO) and significantly restrict the cytosolic dispersion of ACC1 and fatty acid synthase. Notably, AAV-mediated delivery of SA partially blocks mouse liver DNL and ameliorates NASH without eliciting hypertriglyceridemia. In summary, our study shows that insulating lipogenesis-related proteins by SAGMO might be effective for NASH treatment.

Abstract: Summary
CDK4/6 inhibitors are remarkable anti-cancer drugs that can arrest tumor cells in G1 and induce their senescence while causing only relatively mild toxicities in healthy tissues. How they achieve this mechanistically is unclear. We show here that tumor cells are specifically vulnerable to CDK4/6 inhibition because during the G1 arrest, oncogenic signals drive toxic cell overgrowth. This overgrowth causes permanent cell cycle withdrawal by either preventing progression from G1 or inducing genotoxic damage during the subsequent S-phase and mitosis. Inhibiting or reverting oncogenic signals that converge onto mTOR can rescue this excessive growth, DNA damage, and cell cycle exit in cancer cells. Conversely, inducing oncogenic signals in non-transformed cells can drive these toxic phenotypes and sensitize the cells to CDK4/6 inhibition. Together, this demonstrates that cell cycle arrest and oncogenic cell growth is a synthetic lethal combination that is exploited by CDK4/6 inhibitors to induce tumor-specific toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
The T cell receptor (TCR) determines specificity and affinity for both foreign and self-peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Although the strength of TCR interactions with self-pMHC impacts T cell function, it has been challenging to identify TCR sequence features that predict T cell fate. To discern patterns distinguishing TCRs from naive CD4+ T cells with low versus high self-reactivity, we used data from 42 mice to train a machine learning (ML) algorithm that identifies population-level differences between TCRβ sequence sets. This approach revealed that weakly self-reactive T cell populations were enriched for longer CDR3β regions and acidic amino acids. We tested our ML predictions of self-reactivity using retrogenic mice with fixed TCRβ sequences. Extrapolating our analyses to independent datasets, we predicted high self-reactivity for regulatory T cells and slightly reduced self-reactivity for T cells responding to chronic infections. Our analyses suggest a potential trade-off between TCR repertoire diversity and self-reactivity. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
CCS1477 (inobrodib) is a potent, selective EP300/CBP bromodomain inhibitor which induces cell-cycle arrest and differentiation in hematologic malignancy model systems. In myeloid leukemia cells, it promotes rapid eviction of EP300/CBP from an enhancer subset marked by strong MYB occupancy and high H3K27 acetylation, with downregulation of the subordinate oncogenic network and redistribution to sites close to differentiation genes. In myeloma cells, CCS1477 induces eviction of EP300/CBP from FGFR3, the target of the common (4; 14) translocation, with redistribution away from IRF4-occupied sites to TCF3/E2A-occupied sites. In a subset of patients with relapsed or refractory disease, CCS1477 monotherapy induces differentiation responses in AML and objective responses in heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. In vivo preclinical combination studies reveal synergistic responses to treatment with standard-of-care agents. Thus, CCS1477 exhibits encouraging preclinical and early-phase clinical activity by disrupting recruitment of EP300/CBP to enhancer networks occupied by critical transcription factors.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) monitors cellular amino acid changes for function, but the molecular mediators of this process remain to be fully defined. Here, we report that depletion of cellular amino acids, either alone or in combination, leads to the ubiquitination of mTOR, which inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity by preventing substrate recruitment. Mechanistically, amino acid depletion causes accumulation of uncharged tRNAs, thereby stimulating GCN2 to phosphorylate FBXO22, which in turn accrues in the cytoplasm and ubiquitinates mTOR at Lys2066 in a K27-linked manner. Accordingly, mutation of mTOR Lys2066 abolished mTOR ubiquitination in response to amino acid depletion, rendering mTOR insensitive to amino acid starvation both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data reveal a novel mechanism of amino acid sensing by mTORC1 via a previously unknown GCN2-FBXO22-mTOR pathway that is uniquely controlled by uncharged tRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
ARHGAP35, which encodes p190A RhoGAP (p190A), is a major cancer gene. p190A is a tumor suppressor that activates the Hippo pathway. p190A was originally cloned via direct binding to p120 RasGAP (RasGAP). Here, we determine that interaction of p190A with the tight-junction-associated protein ZO-2 is dependent on RasGAP. We establish that both RasGAP and ZO-2 are necessary for p190A to activate large tumor-suppressor (LATS) kinases, elicit mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, promote contact inhibition of cell proliferation, and suppress tumorigenesis. Moreover, RasGAP and ZO-2 are required for transcriptional modulation by p190A. Finally, we demonstrate that low ARHGAP35 expression is associated with shorter survival in patients with high, but not low, transcript levels of TJP2 encoding ZO-2. Hence, we define a tumor-suppressor interactome of p190A that includes ZO-2, an established constituent of the Hippo pathway, and RasGAP, which, despite strong association with Ras signaling, is essential for p190A to activate LATS kinases.

Abstract: Summary
IGHV1-69 is frequently utilized by broadly neutralizing influenza antibodies to the hemagglutinin (HA) stem. These IGHV1-69 HA stem antibodies have diverse complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3 sequences. Besides, their light chains have minimal to no contact with the epitope. Consequently, sequence determinants that confer IGHV1-69 antibodies with HA stem specificity remain largely elusive. Using high-throughput experiments, this study reveals the importance of light-chain sequence for the IGHV1-69 HA stem antibody CR9114, which is the broadest influenza antibody known to date. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CDR H3 sequences from many other IGHV1-69 antibodies, including those to the HA stem, are incompatible with CR9114. Along with mutagenesis and structural analysis, our results indicate that light-chain and CDR H3 sequences coordinately determine the HA stem specificity of IGHV1-69 antibodies. Overall, this work provides molecular insights into broadly neutralizing antibody responses to influenza virus, which have important implications for universal influenza vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce extracellular chemical messages to generate appropriate intracellular responses. Point mutations in GNAO1, encoding the G protein αo subunit, have been implicated in a pathogenic condition characterized by seizures, movement disorders, intellectual disability, and developmental delay (GNAO1 disorder). However, the effects of these mutations on G protein structure and function are unclear. Here, we report the effects of 55 mutations on Gαo conformation, thermostability, nucleotide binding, and hydrolysis, as well as interaction with Gβγ subunits, receptors, and effectors. Our effort reveals four functionally distinct groups of mutants, including one group that sequesters receptors and another that sequesters Gβγ, both acting in a genetically dominant manner. These findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease-relevant mutations and reveal that GNAO1 disorder is likely composed of multiple mechanistically distinct disorders that will likely require multiple therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
We explore the changes in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional programs for cochlear hair cell differentiation from postmitotic supporting cells using organoids from postnatal cochlea. The organoids contain cells with transcriptional signatures of differentiating vestibular and cochlear hair cells. Construction of trajectories identifies Lgr5+ cells as progenitors for hair cells, and the genomic data reveal gene regulatory networks leading to hair cells. We validate these networks, demonstrating dynamic changes both in expression and predicted binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) during organoid differentiation. We identify known regulators of hair cell development, Atoh1, Pou4f3, and Gfi1, and the analysis predicts the regulatory factors Tcf4, an E-protein and heterodimerization partner of Atoh1, and Ddit3, a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) that represses Hes1 and activates transcription of Wnt-signaling-related genes. Deciphering the signals for hair cell regeneration from mammalian cochlear supporting cells reveals candidates for hair cell (HC) regeneration, which is limited in the adult.

Abstract: Summary
Oocyte maturation is vital to attain full competence required for fertilization and embryogenesis. NLRP14 is preferentially expressed in mammalian oocytes and early embryos. Yet, the role and molecular mechanism of NLRP14 in oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis are poorly understood, and whether NLRP14 deficiency accounts for human infertility is unknown. Here, we found that maternal loss of Nlrp14 resulted in sterility with oocyte maturation defects and early embryonic arrest (EEA). Nlrp14 ablation compromised oocyte competence due to impaired cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation. Importantly, we revealed that NLRP14 maintained cytoplasmic UHRF1 abundance by protecting it from proteasome-dependent degradation and anchoring it from nuclear translocation in the oocyte. Furthermore, we identified compound heterozygous NLRP14 variants in women affected by infertility with EEA, which interrupted the NLRP14-UHRF1 interaction and decreased UHRF1 levels. Our data demonstrate NLRP14 as a cytoplasm-specific regulator of UHRF1 during oocyte maturation, providing insights into genetic diagnosis for female infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a significant public health threat due to the ability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants to evade the immune system and cause breakthrough infections. Although pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV lead to severe respiratory infections, how these viruses affect the chromatin proteomic composition upon infection remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we use our recently developed integrative DNA And Protein Tagging methodology to identify changes in host chromatin accessibility states and chromatin proteomic composition upon infection with pathogenic coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces TP53 stabilization on chromatin, which contributes to its host cytopathic effect. We mapped this TP53 stabilization to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and its propensity to form syncytia, a consequence of cell-cell fusion. Differences in SARS-CoV-2 spike variant-induced syncytia formation modify chromatin accessibility, cellular senescence, and inflammatory cytokine release via TP53. Our findings suggest that differences in syncytia formation alter senescence-associated inflammation, which varies among SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: Summary
Niacin, an age-old lipid-lowering drug, acts through the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Yet, its use is hindered by side effects like skin flushing. To address this, specific HCAR2 agonists, like MK-6892 and GSK256073, with fewer adverse effects have been created. However, the activation mechanism of HCAR2 by niacin and these new agonists is not well understood. Here, we present three cryoelectron microscopy structures of Gi-coupled HCAR2 bound to niacin, MK-6892, and GSK256073. Our findings show that different ligands induce varying binding pockets in HCAR2, influenced by aromatic amino acid clusters (W91ECL1, H1614.59, W1885.38, H1895.39, and F1935.43) from receptors ECL1, TM4, and TM5. Additionally, conserved residues R1113.36 and Y2847.43, unique to the HCA receptor family, likely initiate activation signal propagation in HCAR2. This study provides insights into ligand recognition, receptor activation, and G protein coupling mediated by HCAR2, laying the groundwork for developing HCAR2-targeted drugs.

Abstract: Summary
The medial frontal cortex (MFC) plays an important but disputed role in speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT). In samples of neural spiking in the supplementary eye field (SEF) in the MFC simultaneous with the visuomotor frontal eye field and superior colliculus in macaques performing a visual search with instructed SAT, during accuracy emphasis, most SEF neurons discharge less from before stimulus presentation until response generation. Discharge rates adjust immediately and simultaneously across structures upon SAT cue changes. SEF neurons signal choice errors with stronger and earlier activity during accuracy emphasis. Other neurons signal timing errors, covarying with adjusting response time. Spike correlations between neurons in the SEF and visuomotor areas did not appear, disappear, or change sign across SAT conditions or trial outcomes. These results clarify findings with noninvasive measures, complement previous neurophysiological findings, and endorse the role of the MFC as a critic for the actor instantiated in visuomotor structures.

Abstract: Summary
The pore-forming S. aureus α-toxin (Hla) contributes to virulence and disease pathogenesis. While high concentrations of toxin induce cell death, neutrophils exhibit relative resistance to lysis, suggesting that the action of Hla may not be solely conferred by lytic susceptibility. Using intravital microscopy, we observed that Hla disrupts neutrophil localization and clustering early in infection. Hla forms a narrow, ion-selective pore, suggesting that Hla may dysregulate calcium or other ions to impair neutrophil function. We found that sub-lytic Hla did not permit calcium influx but caused rapid membrane depolarization. Depolarization decreases the electrogenic driving force for calcium, and concordantly, Hla suppressed calcium signaling in vitro and in vivo and calcium-dependent leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production, a key mediator of neutrophil clustering. Thus, Hla disrupts the early patterning of the neutrophil response to infection, in part through direct impairment of neutrophil calcium signaling. This early mis-localization of neutrophils may contribute to establishment of infection.

Abstract: Summary
Primary liver cancer (PLC) consists of two main histological subtypes; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). The role of transcription factors (TFs) in malignant hepatobiliary lineage commitment between HCC and iCCA remains underexplored. Here, we present genome-wide profiling of transcription regulatory elements of 16 PLC patients using single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing. Single-cell open chromatin profiles reflect the compositional diversity of liver cancer, identifying both malignant and microenvironment component cells. TF motif enrichment levels of 31 TFs strongly discriminate HCC from iCCA tumors. These TFs are members of the nuclear/retinoid receptor, POU, or ETS motif families. POU factors are associated with prognostic features in iCCA. Overall, nuclear receptors, ETS and POU TF motif families delineate transcription regulation between HCC and iCCA tumors, which may be relevant to development and selection of PLC subtype-specific therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
While 19S proteasome regulatory particle (RP) inhibition is a promising new avenue for treating bortezomib-resistant myeloma, the anti-tumor impact of inhibiting 19S RP component PSMD14 could not be explained by a selective inhibition of proteasomal activity. Here, we report that PSMD14 interacts with NSD2 on chromatin, independent of 19S RP. Functionally, PSMD14 acts as a histone H2AK119 deubiquitinase, facilitating NSD2-directed H3K36 dimethylation. Integrative genomic and epigenomic analyses revealed the functional coordination of PSMD14 and NSD2 in transcriptional activation of target genes (e.g., RELA) linked to myelomagenesis. Reciprocally, RELA transactivates PSMD14, forming a PSMD14/NSD2-RELA positive feedback loop. Remarkably, PSMD14 inhibitors enhance bortezomib sensitivity and fosters anti-myeloma synergy. PSMD14 expression is elevated in myeloma and inversely correlated with overall survival. Our study uncovers an unappreciated function of PSMD14 as an epigenetic regulator and a myeloma driver, supporting the pursuit of PSMD14 as a therapeutic target to overcome the treatment limitation of myeloma.

Abstract: Summary
Trans-differentiation from an adenocarcinoma to a small cell neuroendocrine state is associated with therapy resistance in multiple cancer types. To gain insight into the underlying molecular events of the trans-differentiation, we perform a multi-omics time course analysis of a pan-small cell neuroendocrine cancer model (termed PARCB), a forward genetic transformation using human prostate basal cells and identify a shared developmental, arc-like, and entropy-high trajectory among all transformation model replicates. Further mapping with single cell resolution reveals two distinct lineages defined by mutually exclusive expression of ASCL1 or ASCL2. Temporal regulation by groups of transcription factors across developmental stages reveals that cellular reprogramming precedes the induction of neuronal programs. TFAP4 and ASCL1/2 feedback are identified as potential regulators of ASCL1 and ASCL2 expression. Our study provides temporal transcriptional patterns and uncovers pan-tissue parallels between prostate and lung cancers, as well as connections to normal neuroendocrine cell states.

Abstract: Summary
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is characterized by atherosclerotic plaque formation in the arterial wall. CAD progression involves complex interactions and phenotypic plasticity among vascular and immune cell lineages. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies have highlighted lineage-specific transcriptomic signatures, but human cell phenotypes remain controversial. Here, we perform an integrated meta-analysis of 22 scRNA-seq libraries to generate a comprehensive map of human atherosclerosis with 118,578 cells. Besides characterizing granular cell-type diversity and communication, we leverage this atlas to provide insights into smooth muscle cell (SMC) modulation. We integrate genome-wide association study data and uncover a critical role for modulated SMC phenotypes in CAD, myocardial infarction, and coronary calcification. Finally, we identify fibromyocyte/fibrochondrogenic SMC markers (LTBP1 and CRTAC1) as proxies of atherosclerosis progression and validate these through omics and spatial imaging analyses. Altogether, we create a unified atlas of human atherosclerosis informing cell state-specific mechanistic and translational studies of cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Summary
We make decisions based on currently perceivable information or an internal model of the environment. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and its interaction with the hippocampus have been implicated in the latter, model-based decision-making; however, the underlying computational properties remain incompletely understood. We have examined mPFC spiking and hippocampal oscillatory activity while rats flexibly select new actions using a known associative structure of environmental cues and outcomes. During action selection, the mPFC reinstates representations of the associative structure. These awake reactivation events are accompanied by synchronous firings among neurons coding the associative structure and those coding actions. Moreover, their functional coupling is strengthened upon the reactivation events leading to adaptive actions. In contrast, only cue-coding neurons improve functional coupling during hippocampal sharp wave ripples. Thus, the lack of direct experience disconnects the mPFC from the hippocampus to independently form self-organized neuronal ensemble dynamics linking prior knowledge with novel actions.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated iron or Ca2+ homeostasis has been reported in Parkinson’s disease (PD) models. Here, we discover a connection between these two metals at the mitochondria. Elevation of iron levels causes inward mitochondrial Ca2+ overflow, through an interaction of Fe2+ with mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). In PD neurons, iron accumulation-triggered Ca2+ influx across the mitochondrial surface leads to spatially confined Ca2+ elevation at the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is subsequently sensed by Miro1, a Ca2+-binding protein. A Miro1 blood test distinguishes PD patients from controls and responds to drug treatment. Miro1-based drug screens in PD cells discover Food and Drug Administration-approved T-type Ca2+-channel blockers. Human genetic analysis reveals enrichment of rare variants in T-type Ca2+-channel subtypes associated with PD status. Our results identify a molecular mechanism in PD pathophysiology and drug targets and candidates coupled with a convenient stratification method.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms that trigger Tau aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remain elusive. Fungi, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), can be found in brain samples from patients with AD. Here, we show that the yeast protein Ure2p from S. cerevisiae interacts with Tau and facilitates its aggregation. The Ure2p-seeded Tau fibrils are more potent in seeding Tau and causing neurotoxicity in vitro. When injected into the hippocampus of Tau P301S transgenic mice, the Ure2p-seeded Tau fibrils show enhanced seeding activity compared with pure Tau fibrils. Strikingly, intracranial injection of Ure2p fibrils promotes the aggregation of Tau and cognitive impairment in Tau P301S mice. Furthermore, intranasal infection of S. cerevisiae in the nasal cavity of Tau P301S mice accelerates the aggregation of Tau. Together, these observations indicate that the yeast protein Ure2p initiates Tau pathology. Our results provide a conceptual advance that non-mammalian prions may cross-seed mammalian prion-like proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Monoclonal antibodies against the Ebola virus (EBOV) surface glycoprotein are effective treatments for EBOV disease. Antibodies targeting the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) head epitope have potent neutralization and Fc effector function activity and thus are of high interest as therapeutics and for vaccine design. Here we focus on the head-binding antibodies 1A2 and 1D5, which have been identified previously in a longitudinal study of survivors of EBOV infection. 1A2 and 1D5 have the same heavy- and light-chain germlines despite being isolated from different individuals and at different time points after recovery from infection. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of each antibody in complex with the EBOV surface GP reveals key amino acid substitutions in 1A2 that contribute to greater affinity, improved neutralization potency, and enhanced breadth as well as two strategies for antibody evolution from a common site.

Abstract: Summary
Human brain size changes dynamically through early development, peaks in adolescence, and varies up to 2-fold among adults. However, the molecular genetic underpinnings of interindividual variation in brain size remain unknown. Here, we leveraged postmortem brain RNA sequencing and measurements of brain weight (BW) in 2,531 individuals across three independent datasets to identify 928 genome-wide significant associations with BW. Genes associated with higher or lower BW showed distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories and spatial patterns that mapped onto functional and cellular axes of brain organization. Expression of BW genes was predictive of interspecies differences in brain size, and bioinformatic annotation revealed enrichment for neurogenesis and cell-cell communication. Genome-wide, transcriptome-wide, and phenome-wide association analyses linked BW gene sets to neuroimaging measurements of brain size and brain-related clinical traits. Cumulatively, these results represent a major step toward delineating the molecular pathways underlying human brain size variation in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Stress granules (SGs) constitute a signaling hub that plays a critical role in type I interferon responses. Here, we report that growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible beta (Gadd45β) act as a positive regulator of SG-mediated interferon signaling by targeting G3BP upon RNA virus infection. Gadd45β deficiency markedly impairs SG formation and SG-mediated activation of interferon signaling in vitro. Gadd45β knockout mice are highly susceptible to RNA virus infection, and their ability to produce interferon and cytokines is severely impaired. Specifically, Gadd45β interacts with the RNA-binding domain of G3BP, leading to conformational expansion of G3BP1 via dissolution of its autoinhibitory electrostatic intramolecular interaction. The acidic loop 1- and RNA-binding properties of Gadd45β markedly increase the conformational expansion and RNA-binding affinity of the G3BP1-Gadd45β complex, thereby promoting assembly of SGs. These findings suggest a role for Gadd45β as a component and critical regulator of G3BP1-mediated SG formation, which facilitates RLR-mediated interferon signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Deciphering the mechanisms underlying viral persistence is critical to achieving a cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here, we implement a systems approach to discover molecular signatures of HIV latently infected CD4+ T cells, identifying the immunosuppressive, adenosine-producing ectonucleotidase CD73 as a key surface marker of latent cells. Hypoxic conditioning, reflecting the lymphoid tissue microenvironment, increases the frequency of CD73+ CD4+ T cells and promotes HIV latency. Transcriptomic profiles of CD73+ CD4+ T cells favor viral quiescence, immune evasion, and cell survival. CD73+ CD4+ T cells are capable of harboring a functional HIV reservoir and reinitiating productive infection ex vivo. CD73 or adenosine receptor blockade facilitates latent HIV reactivation in vitro, mechanistically linking adenosine signaling to viral quiescence. Finally, tissue imaging of lymph nodes from HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy reveals spatial association between CD73 expression and HIV persistence in vivo. Our findings warrant development of HIV-cure strategies targeting the hypoxia-CD73-adenosine axis.

Abstract: Summary
Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are vital for defending tissue barriers from invading pathogens. Hypoxia influences the production of intestinal ILC3-derived cytokines by activating HIF. Yet, the mechanisms governing HIF-1α in ILC3s and other innate RORγt+ cells during in vivo infections are poorly understood. In our study, transgenic mice with specific Hif-1a gene inactivation in innate RORγt+ cells (RAG1KO HIF-1α▵Rorc) exhibit more severe colitis following Citrobacter rodentium infection, primarily due to the inability to upregulate IL-22. We find that HIF-1α▵Rorc mice have impaired IL-22 production in ILC3s, while non-ILC3 innate RORγt+ cells, also capable of producing IL-22, remain unaffected. Furthermore, we show that IL-18, induced by Toll-like receptor 2, selectively triggers IL-22 in ILC3s by transcriptionally upregulating HIF-1α, revealing an oxygen-independent regulatory pathway. Our results highlight that, during late-stage C. rodentium infection, IL-18 induction in the colon promotes IL-22 through HIF-1α in ILC3s, which is crucial for protection against this pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
tRNA fragments (tRFs) are a recently identified class of small noncoding RNAs. To date, the regulation of tRF abundance and its functional mechanisms have been largely unclear in plants. We investigated how the Arabidopsis thaliana receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) regulates the abundance of tRFs to inhibit global mRNA translation. We demonstrate that FER regulates tRF abundance by directly phosphorylating the tRNA-binding protein YUELAO (YL) to modulate its function. Downregulation of FER and YL prevented the modification of tRNA via cytosine-5-methylation and 2′-O-methylation, thereby increasing tRF abundance. Furthermore, we show that YL acts as an important genetic downstream target of FER signaling, and knockdown of a specific tRF partially rescues the root hair growth defects of fer and yl mutants. Our findings shed light on the abundance and regulatory mechanisms of tRF and their role in inhibiting translation in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Vibrio cholerae is an aquatic bacterium that causes severe and potentially deadly diarrheal disease. Despite the impact on global health, our understanding of host mucosal responses to Vibrio remains limited, highlighting a knowledge gap critical for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Using a natural infection model, we combine physiological and single-cell transcriptomic studies to characterize conventionally reared adult zebrafish guts and guts challenged with Vibrio. We demonstrate that Vibrio causes a mild mucosal immune response characterized by T cell activation and enhanced antigen capture; Vibrio suppresses host interferon signaling; and ectopic activation of interferon alters the course of infection. We show that the adult zebrafish gut shares similarities with mammalian counterparts, including the presence of Best4+ cells, tuft cells, and a population of basal cycling cells. These findings provide important insights into host-pathogen interactions and emphasize the utility of zebrafish as a natural model of Vibrio infection.

Abstract: Summary
Biomolecular condensates have emerged as a major organizational principle in the cell. However, the formation, maintenance, and dissolution of condensates are still poorly understood. Transcriptional machinery partitions into biomolecular condensates at key cell identity genes to activate these. Here, we report a specific perturbation of WNT-activated β-catenin condensates that disrupts oncogenic signaling. We use a live-cell condensate imaging method in human cancer cells to discover FOXO and TCF-derived peptides that specifically inhibit β-catenin condensate formation on DNA, perturb nuclear β-catenin condensates in cells, and inhibit β-catenin-driven transcriptional activation and colorectal cancer cell growth. We show that these peptides compete with homotypic intermolecular interactions that normally drive condensate formation. Using this framework, we derive short peptides that specifically perturb condensates and transcriptional activation of YAP and TAZ in the Hippo pathway. We propose a “monomer saturation” model in which short interacting peptides can be used to specifically inhibit condensate-associated transcription in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIPR) receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in glucose homeostasis. Diabetogenic conditions decrease β-arrestin 2 (ARRB2) levels in human islets. In mouse β cells, ARRB2 dampens insulin secretion by partially uncoupling cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling at physiological doses of GLP-1, whereas at pharmacological doses, the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) requires ARRB2. In contrast, GIP-potentiated insulin secretion needs ARRB2 in mouse and human islets. The GIPR-ARRB2 axis is not involved in cAMP/PKA or ERK signaling but does mediate GIP-induced F-actin depolymerization. Finally, the dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide does not require ARRB2 for the potentiation of insulin secretion. Thus, ARRB2 plays distinct roles in regulating GLP-1R and GIPR signaling, and we highlight (1) its role in the physiological context and the possible functional consequences of its decreased expression in pathological situations such as diabetes and (2) the importance of assessing the signaling pathways engaged by the agonists (biased/dual) for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: Summary
Evoked brain oscillations in the gamma range have been shown to assist in stroke recovery. However, the causal relationship between evoked oscillations and neuroprotection is not well understood. We have used optogenetic stimulation to investigate how evoked gamma oscillations modulate cortical dynamics in the acute phase after stroke. Our results reveal that stimulation at 40 Hz drives activity in interneurons at the stimulation frequency and phase-locked activity in principal neurons at a lower frequency, leading to increased cross-frequency coupling. In addition, 40-Hz stimulation after stroke enhances interregional communication. These effects are observed up to 24 h after stimulation. Our stimulation protocol also rescues functional synaptic plasticity 24 h after stroke and leads to an upregulation of plasticity genes and a downregulation of cell death genes. Together these results suggest that restoration of cortical dynamics may confer neuroprotection after stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Upregulation of FGL1 helps tumors escape from immune surveillance, and therapeutic antibodies targeting FGL1 have potential as another immune checkpoint inhibitor. However, the underlying mechanism of high FGL1 protein level in cancers is not well defined. Here, we report that FBXO38 interacts with and ubiquitylates FGL1 to negatively regulate its stability and to mediate cancer immune response. Depletion of FBXO38 markedly augments FGL1 abundance, not only suppressing CD8+ T cell infiltration and enhancing immune evasion of tumor but also increasing inflammation in mice. Importantly, we observe a negative correlation of FBXO38 with FGL1 and IL-6 in non-small cell lung cancer specimens. FGL1 and IL-6 levels positively correlate with TNM (tumor, lymph node, metastasis) stages, while FBXO38 and the infiltrating CD8+ T cells negatively correlate with TNM stages. Our study identifies a mechanism regulating FGL1 stability and a target to enhance the immunotherapy and suggests that the combination of anti-FGL1 and anti-IL-6 is a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present in almost all the tissues in the body, critical for their homeostasis and regeneration. However, the stemness of MSCs is mainly an in vitro observation, and lacking exclusive markers for endogenous MSCs makes it difficult to study the multipotency of MSCs in vivo, especially for human MSCs. To address this hurdle, we injected GFP-tagged human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived MSCs (EMSCs) into mouse blastocysts. EMSCs survived well and penetrated both the inner cell mass and trophectoderm, correlating to the higher anti-apoptotic capability of EMSCs than hESCs. Injected EMSCs contributed to skeletal, dermal, and extraembryonic tissues in the resultant chimera and partially rescued skeletal defects in Sox9+/− mouse fetuses. Thus, this study provides evidence for the stemness and developmental capability of human MSCs through chimerization with the mouse blastocyst, serving as a model for studying human mesenchymal and skeletal development.

Abstract: Summary
The action observation network (AON) has been extensively studied using short, isolated motor acts. How activity in the network is altered when these isolated acts are embedded in meaningful sequences of actions remains poorly understood. Here we utilized intracranial electrocorticography to characterize how the exchange of information across key nodes of the AON—the precentral, supramarginal, and visual cortices—is affected by such embedding and the resulting predictability. We found more top-down beta oscillation from precentral to supramarginal contacts during the observation of predictable actions in meaningful sequences compared to the same actions in randomized, and hence less predictable, order. In addition, we find that expectations enabled by the embedding lead to a suppression of bottom-up visual responses in the high-gamma range in visual areas. These results, in line with predictive coding, inform how nodes of the AON integrate information to process the actions of others.

Abstract: Summary
Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that are involved in the pathophysiology of many diseases. However, the role of tRFs in cancer progression remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a pan-cancer 3′-tRF, CAT1 (cancer associated tRF 1), is ubiquitously upregulated in tumors and associated with poor prognosis of a variety of cancers, including lung cancer. The upregulated CAT1 in cancer cells binds to RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) and displaces NOTCH2 association from RBPMS, thereby inhibiting the subsequent CCR4-NOT deadenylation-complex-mediated NOTCH2 mRNA decay. The CAT1-enhanced NOTCH2 expression promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, plasma CAT1 levels are substantially increased in patients with lung cancer compared to non-cancer control subjects. Our findings reveal an intrinsic connection between cancer-specific upregulation of CAT1 and cancer progression, show the regulation of NOTCH signaling in cancer by a 3′-tRF, and highlight its great clinical potential.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells are key components of the immune response during lung infections and can mediate protection against tuberculosis (TB) or influenza. However, CD4+ T cells can also promote lung pathology during these infections, making it unclear how these cells control such discrepant effects. Using mouse models of hypervirulent TB and influenza, we observe that exaggerated accumulation of parenchymal CD4+ T cells promotes lung damage. Low numbers of lung CD4+ T cells, in contrast, are sufficient to protect against hypervirulent TB. In both situations, lung CD4+ T cell accumulation is mediated by CD4+ T cell-specific expression of the extracellular ATP (eATP) receptor P2RX7. P2RX7 upregulation in lung CD4+ T cells promotes expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3, favoring parenchymal CD4+ T cell accumulation.

Abstract: A recent study revealed that the loss of Deup1 expression does not affect either centriole amplification or multicilia formation. Therefore, the deuterosome per se is not a platform for amplification of centrioles. In this study, we examine whether gain-of-function of Deup1 affects the development of multiciliated ependymal cells. Our time-lapse study reveals that deuterosomes with an average diameter of 300 nm have two different fates during ependymal differentiation. In the first instance, deuterosomes are scattered and gradually disappear as cells become multiciliated. In the second instance, deuterosomes self-organize into a larger aggregate, called a deuterosome cluster (DC). Unlike scattered deuterosomes, DCs possess centriole components primarily within their large structure. A characteristic of DC-containing cells is that they tend to become primary ciliated rather than multiciliated. Our in utero electroporation study shows that DCs in ependymal tissue are mostly observed at early postnatal stages, but are scarce at late postnatal stages, suggesting the presence of DC antagonists within the differentiating cells. Importantly, from our bead flow assay, ectopic expression of Deup1 significantly impairs cerebrospinal fluid flow. Furthermore, we show that expression of mouse Deup1 in Xenopus embryos has an inhibitory effect on differentiation of multiciliated cells in the epidermis. Taken together, we conclude that the DC formation of Deup1 in multiciliated cells inhibits production of multiple centrioles.

Abstract: Summary
The aggressiveness of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is affected by the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, to recapitulate the PDAC TME ex vivo, we cocultured patient-derived PDAC cells with mesenchymal and vascular endothelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to create a fused pancreatic cancer organoid (FPCO) in an air-liquid interface. FPCOs were further induced to resemble two distinct aspects of PDAC tissue. Quiescent FPCOs were drug resistant, likely because the TME consisted of abundant extracellular matrix proteins that were secreted from the various types of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) derived from hiPSCs. Proliferative FPCOs could re-proliferate after anticancer drug treatment, suggesting that this type of FPCO would be useful for studying PDAC recurrence. Thus, we generated PDAC organoids that recapitulate the heterogeneity of PDAC tissue and are a potential platform for screening anticancer drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiated cardiomyocytes (CMs) must undergo diverse morphological and functional changes during postnatal development. However, the mechanisms underlying initiation and coordination of these changes remain unclear. Here, we delineate an integrated, time-ordered transcriptional network that begins with expression of genes for cell-cell connections and leads to a sequence of structural, cell-cycle, functional, and metabolic transitions in mouse postnatal hearts. Depletion of histone H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF20 disrupts this gene network and impairs CM polarization. Subsequently, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis confirmed that RNF20 contributes to chromatin accessibility in this context. As such, RNF20 is likely to facilitate binding of transcription factors at the promoters of genes involved in cell-cell connections and actin organization, which are crucial for CM polarization and functional integration. These results suggest that CM polarization is one of the earliest events during postnatal heart development and provide insights into how RNF20 regulates CM polarity and the postnatal gene program.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription termination by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is linked to RNA 3′ end processing by the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF or CPSF). CPF contains endonuclease, poly(A) polymerase, and protein phosphatase activities, which cleave and polyadenylate pre-mRNAs and dephosphorylate RNA Pol II to control transcription. Exactly how the RNA 3′ end processing machinery is coupled to transcription remains unclear. Here, we combine in vitro reconstitution, structural studies, and genome-wide analyses to show that yeast CPF physically and functionally interacts with RNA Pol II. Surprisingly, CPF-mediated dephosphorylation promotes the formation of an RNA Pol II stalk-to-stalk homodimer in vitro. This dimer is compatible with transcription but not with the binding of transcription elongation factors. Disruption of the dimerization interface in cells causes transcription defects, including altered RNA Pol II abundance on protein-coding genes, tRNA genes, and intergenic regions. We hypothesize that RNA Pol II dimerization may provide a mechanistic basis for the allosteric model of transcription termination.

Abstract: Summary
B cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is composed of diverse molecular subtypes, and while transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling has been extensively examined, the chromatin landscape is not well characterized for many subtypes. We therefore mapped chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq in primary B-ALL cells from 156 patients spanning ten molecular subtypes and present this dataset as a resource. Differential chromatin accessibility and transcription factor (TF) footprint profiling were employed and identified B-ALL cell of origin, TF-target gene interactions enriched in B-ALL, and key TFs associated with accessible chromatin sites preferentially active in B-ALL. We further identified over 20% of accessible chromatin sites exhibiting strong subtype enrichment and candidate TFs that maintain subtype-specific chromatin architectures. Over 9,000 genetic variants were uncovered, contributing to variability in chromatin accessibility among patient samples. Our data suggest that distinct chromatin architectures are driven by diverse TFs and inherited genetic variants that promote unique gene-regulatory networks.

Abstract: Summary
Schwann cells respond to acute axon damage by transiently transdifferentiating into specialized repair cells that restore sensorimotor function. However, the molecular systems controlling repair cell formation and function are not well defined, and consequently, it is unclear whether this form of cellular plasticity has a role in peripheral neuropathies. Here, we identify Mitf as a transcriptional sensor of axon damage under the control of Nrg-ErbB-PI3K-PI5K-mTorc2 signaling. Mitf regulates a core transcriptional program for generating functional repair Schwann cells following injury and during peripheral neuropathies caused by CMT4J and CMT4D. In the absence of Mitf, core genes for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metabolism, and dedifferentiation are misexpressed, and nerve repair is disrupted. Our findings demonstrate that Schwann cells monitor axonal health using a phosphoinositide signaling system that controls Mitf nuclear localization, which is critical for activating cellular plasticity and counteracting neural disease.

Abstract: Summary
Human pancreatic plasticity is implied from multiple single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies. However, these have been invariably based on static datasets from which fate trajectories can only be inferred using pseudotemporal estimations. Furthermore, the analysis of isolated islets has resulted in a drastic underrepresentation of other cell types, hindering our ability to interrogate exocrine-endocrine interactions. The long-term culture of human pancreatic slices (HPSs) has presented the field with an opportunity to dynamically track tissue plasticity at the single-cell level. Combining datasets from same-donor HPSs at different time points, with or without a known regenerative stimulus (BMP signaling), led to integrated single-cell datasets storing true temporal or treatment-dependent information. This integration revealed population shifts consistent with ductal progenitor activation, blurring of ductal/acinar boundaries, formation of ducto-acinar-endocrine differentiation axes, and detection of transitional insulin-producing cells. This study provides the first longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of whole human pancreatic tissue, confirming its plasticity in a dynamic fashion.

Abstract: Summary
IL-31 receptor blockade suppresses pruritus of atopic dermatitis. However, cell-type-specific contributions of IL-31 receptor to itch, its expression mechanism, and the downstream signaling pathway to induce itch remain unknown. Here, using conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that IL-31-induced itch requires sensory neuronal IL-31 receptor and STAT3. We find that IL-31 receptor expression is dependent on STAT3 in sensory neurons. In addition, pharmacological experiments suggest that STAT3 activation is important for the itch-inducing signaling downstream of the IL-31 receptor. A cutaneous IL-31 injection induces the nuclear accumulation of activated STAT3 first in sensory neurons that abundantly express IL-31 receptor and then in other itch-transmitting neurons. IL-31 enhances itch induced by various pruritogens including even chloroquine. Finally, pruritus associated with dermatitis is partially dependent on sensory neuronal IL-31 receptor and strongly on sensory neuronal STAT3. Thus, sensory neuronal STAT3 is essential for IL-31-induced itch and further contributes to IL-31-independent inflammatory itch.

Abstract: Summary
In the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, invasive hyphal growth is a well-recognized virulence trait. We employed transposon-mediated genome-wide mutagenesis, revealing that inactivating CTM1 blocks hyphal growth. CTM1 encodes a lysine (K) methyltransferase, which trimethylates cytochrome c (Cyc1) at K79. Mutants lacking CTM1 or expressing cyc1K79A grow as yeast under hyphae-inducing conditions, indicating that unmethylated Cyc1 suppresses hyphal growth. Transcriptomic analyses detected increased levels of the hyphal repressor NRG1 and decreased levels of hyphae-specific genes in ctm1Δ/Δ and cyc1K79A mutants, suggesting cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling suppression. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that unmethylated Cyc1 inhibits PKA kinase activity. Surprisingly, hyphae-defective ctm1Δ/Δ and cyc1K79A mutants remain virulent in mice due to accelerated proliferation. Our results unveil a critical role for cytochrome c in maintaining the virulence of C. albicans by orchestrating proliferation, growth mode, and metabolism. Importantly, this study identifies a biological function for lysine methylation on cytochrome c.

Abstract: Summary
One of the hallmarks of intractable psoriasis is neutrophil infiltration in skin lesions. However, detailed molecular mechanisms of neutrophil chemotaxis and activation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate a significant upregulation of epidermal fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP, FABP5) in the skin of human psoriasis and psoriatic mouse models. Genetic deletion of FABP5 in mice by global knockout and keratinocyte conditional (Krt6a-Cre) knockout, but not myeloid cell conditional (LysM-Cre) knockout, attenuates psoriatic symptoms. Immunophenotypic analysis shows that FABP5 deficiency specifically reduces skin recruitment of Ly6G+ neutrophils. Mechanistically, activated keratinocytes produce chemokines and cytokines that trigger neutrophil chemotaxis and activation in an FABP5-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis further identifies that FABP5 interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP), a key player in NF-κB signaling activation. Silencing of FABP5, VCP, or both inhibits NF-κB/neutrophil chemotaxis signaling. Collectively, these data demonstrate dysregulated FABP5 as a molecular mechanism promoting NF-κB signaling and neutrophil infiltration in psoriasis pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Detection of deviant stimuli is crucial to orient and adapt our behavior. Previous work shows that deviant stimuli elicit phasic activation of the locus coeruleus (LC), which releases noradrenaline and controls central arousal. However, it is unclear whether the detection of behaviorally relevant deviant stimuli selectively triggers LC responses or other neuromodulatory systems (dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine). We combine human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings optimized for brainstem imaging with pupillometry to perform a mapping of deviant-related responses in subcortical structures. Participants have to detect deviant items in a “local-global” paradigm that distinguishes between deviance based on the stimulus probability and the sequence structure. fMRI responses to deviant stimuli are distributed in many cortical areas. Both types of deviance elicit responses in the pupil, LC, and other neuromodulatory systems. Our results reveal that the detection of task-relevant deviant items recruits the same multiple subcortical systems across computationally different types of deviance.

Abstract: Summary
Interaction between the gut microbiome and host plays a key role in human health. Here, we perform a metagenome shotgun-sequencing-based analysis of Japanese participants to reveal associations between the gut microbiome, host genetics, and plasma metabolome. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for microbial species (n = 524) identifies associations between the PDE1C gene locus and Bacteroides intestinalis and between TGIF2 and TGIF2-RAB5IF gene loci and Bacteroides acidifiaciens. In a microbial gene ortholog GWAS, agaE and agaS, which are related to the metabolism of carbohydrates forming the blood group A antigen, are associated with blood group A in a manner depending on the secretor status determined by the East Asian-specific FUT2 variant. A microbiome-metabolome association analysis (n = 261) identifies associations between bile acids and microbial features such as bile acid metabolism gene orthologs including bai and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Our publicly available data will be a useful resource for understanding gut microbiome-host interactions in an underrepresented population.

Abstract: Summary
Growth factor receptors rank among the most important oncogenic pathways, but pharmacologic inhibitors often demonstrate limited benefit as monotherapy. Here, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling repressed N6-methyladenosine (m6A) levels in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), whereas genetic or pharmacologic EGFR targeting elevated m6A levels. Activated EGFR induced non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC to phosphorylate the m6A demethylase, AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), thereby inhibiting chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-mediated nuclear export of ALKBH5 to permit sustained mRNA m6A demethylation in the nucleus. ALKBH5 critically regulated ferroptosis through m6A modulation and YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein (YTHDF2)-mediated decay of the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM). Pharmacologic targeting of ALKBH5 augmented the anti-tumor efficacy of EGFR and GCLM inhibitors, supporting an EGFR-ALKBH5-GCLM oncogenic axis. Collectively, EGFR reprograms the epitranscriptomic landscape through nuclear retention of the ALKBH5 demethylase to protect against ferroptosis, offering therapeutic paradigms for the treatment of lethal cancers.
