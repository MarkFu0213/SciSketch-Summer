Abstract: Here we show the crucial role of MPP1 in lateral membrane ordering/organization in HEL cells (derived from erythroid precursors). Biochemical analyses showed that inhibition of MPP1 palmitoylation or silencing of the MPP1 gene led to a dramatic decrease in the DRM fraction. This was accompanied by a reduction of membrane order as shown by fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) analyses. Furthermore, MPP1 knockdown significantly affects the activation of MAP-kinase signaling via raft-dependent RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) receptors, indicating the importance of MPP1 for lateral membrane organization. In conclusion, palmitoylation of MPP1 appears to be at least one of the mechanisms controlling lateral organization of the erythroid cell membrane. Thus, this study, together with our recent results on erythrocytes, reported elsewhere (Łach et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2012, 287, 18974–18984), points to a new role for MPP1 and presents a novel linkage between membrane raft organization and protein palmitoylation.

Abstract: Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins occurs through interactions with integrins that bind to Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptides, and syndecan-4, which recognizes the heparin-binding domain of other proteins. Both receptors trigger signaling pathways, including those that activate RhoGTPases such as RhoA and Rac1. This sequence of events modulates cell adhesion to the ECM and cell migration. Using a neuron–astrocyte model, we have reported that the neuronal protein Thy-1 engages αVβ3 integrin and syndecan-4 to induce RhoA activation and strong astrocyte adhesion to their underlying substrate. Thus, because cell–cell interactions and strong cell attachment to the matrix are considered antagonistic to cell migration, we hypothesized that Thy-1 stimulation of astrocytes should preclude cell migration. Here, we studied the effect of Thy-1 expressing neurons on astrocyte polarization and migration using a wound-healing assay and immunofluorescence analysis. Signaling molecules involved were studied by affinity precipitation, western blotting and the usage of specific antibodies. Intriguingly, Thy-1 interaction with its two receptors was found to increase astrocyte polarization and migration. The latter events required interactions of these receptors with both the RGD-like sequence and the heparin-binding domain of Thy-1. Additionally, prolonged Thy-1-receptor interactions inhibited RhoA activation while activating FAK, PI3K and Rac1. Therefore, sustained engagement of integrin and syndecan-4 with the neuronal surface protein Thy-1 induces astrocyte migration. Interestingly we identify here, a cell–cell interaction that despite initially inducing strong cell attachment, favors cell migration upon persistent stimulation by engaging the same signaling receptors and molecules as those utilized by the extracellular matrix proteins to stimulate cell movement.

Abstract: To investigate a possible role of the nitrogen-PTS (PTSNtr) in controlling carbon metabolism, we determined the growth of Escherichia coli LJ110 and of isogenic derivatives, mutated in components of the PTSNtr, on different carbon sources. The PTSNtr is a set of proteins homologous to the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system (C-PTS) that transfers a phosphate group from PEP over EINtr (encoded by ptsP) and NPr (encoded by ptsO) to EIIANtr (encoded by ptsN). Strains deleted in ptsN were characterized by a high acetate production coupled to slow growth on glycolytic substrates. The ΔptsP and the ΔptsO strain showed the same behavior as the parent strain. As the phosphorylation level of EIIANtr in these mutants differed significantly from that of the parent strain, phosphorylation of EIIANtr obviously is not important for its function. During growth in minimal medium with defined carbon sources, EIIANtr was always completely phosphorylated in LJ110. Significant amounts of dephosphorylated EIIANtr were only visible in strains lacking EINtr or NPr. mRNA expression studies on glucose revealed a downregulation of genes encoding TCA cycle enzymes when EIIANtr was absent. 13C-flux analyses confirmed higher fluxes towards acetate and lower fluxes in the TCA cycle in the ptsN mutants but additionally hinted to a slightly but significantly increased flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). During growth on succinate the ΔptsN strain accumulated mutations in rpoS, while no rpoS mutants were observed for the ΔptsN-O strain. This hints to an additional function of NPr during growth with succinate.

Abstract: The apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is activated in response to a wide variety of extracellular stressors. Consequently, dysregulation of ASK1 is associated with multiple pathologies. Here, we show that ASK1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in HEK293 cells and human cardiomyocytes in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or angiotensin respectively. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry experiments reveal that ASK1 physically interacts with the karyopherin α2/β1 heterodimer in response to stress and genetic knockdown experiments confirm that this association mediates H2O2-induced ASK1 nuclear translocation. In addition, we have identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like motif within the primary amino acid sequence of ASK1 composed of two clusters of basic amino acids separated by an intervening 16 amino acid spacer, KR[ACANDLLVDEFLKVSS]KKKK. Mutation of the downstream lysine cluster markedly reduces the H2O2-induced ASK1-karyopherin α2/β1 interaction and inhibits ASK1 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nuclear ASK1 is active and participates in H2O2-induced ASK1-mediated cell death. Collectively, our findings have identified a functional interaction between ASK1 and the karyopherin α2/β1 heterodimer and have also revealed a novel mechanism by which nuclear trafficking regulates the apoptotic function of ASK1 in response to stress.

Abstract: C-Raf is a member of the Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that plays key roles in diverse physiological processes and is upregulated in many human cancers. C-Raf activation involves binding to Ras, increased phosphorylation and interactions with co-factors. Here, we describe a Ras-independent in vivo pathway for C-Raf activation by its downstream target MEK. Using 32P-metabolic labeling and 2D-phosphopeptide mapping experiments, we show that MEK increases C-Raf phosphorylation by up-to 10-fold. This increase was associated with C-Raf kinase activation, matching the activity seen with growth factor stimulation. Consequently, coexpression of wildtype C-Raf and MEK was sufficient for full and constitutive activation of ERK. Notably, the ability of MEK to activate C-Raf was completely Ras independent, since mutants impaired in Ras binding that are irresponsive to growth factors or Ras were fully activated by MEK. The ability of MEK to activate C-Raf was only partially dependent on MEK kinase activity but required MEK binding to C-Raf, suggesting that the binding results in a conformational change that increases C-Raf susceptibility to phosphorylation and activation or in the stabilization of the phosphorylated-active form. These findings propose a novel Ras-independent mechanism for activating the C-Raf and the MAPK pathway without the need for mutations in the pathway. This mechanism could be of significance in pathological conditions or cancers overexpressing C-Raf and MEK or in conditions where C-Raf–MEK interaction is enhanced due to the down-regulation of RKIP and MST2.

Abstract: Yeast chronological aging is regarded as a model for aging of mammalian post-mitotic cells. It refers to changes occurring in stationary phase cells over a relatively long period of time. How long these cells can survive in such a non-dividing state defines the chronological lifespan. Several factors influence cell survival including two well known normal by-products of yeast glucose fermentation such as ethanol and acetic acid. In fact, the presence in the growth medium of these C2 compounds has been shown to limit the chronological lifespan. In the chronological aging paradigm, a pro-aging role has also emerged for the deacetylase Sir2, the founding member of the Sirtuin family, whose loss of function increases the depletion of extracellular ethanol by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that lack of Sir2 strongly influences carbon metabolism. In particular, we point out a more efficient acetate utilization which in turn may have a stimulatory effect on ethanol catabolism. This correlates with an enhanced glyoxylate/gluconeogenic flux which is fuelled by the acetyl-CoA produced from the acetate activation. Thus, when growth relies on a respiratory metabolism such as that on ethanol or acetate, SIR2 inactivation favors growth. Moreover, in the chronological aging paradigm, the increase in the acetate metabolism implies that sir2Δ cells avoid acetic acid accumulation in the medium and deplete ethanol faster; consequently pro-aging extracellular signals are reduced. In addition, an enhanced gluconeogenesis allows replenishment of intracellular glucose stores which may be useful for better long-term cell survival.

Abstract: Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a dimeric transcription factor of the bHLH-PAS family, is comprised of HIF-1α, which is inducible by hypoxia and ARNT or HIF-1β, which is constitutively expressed. HIF-1 is involved in cellular homeostasis under hypoxia, in development and in several diseases affected by oxygen availability, particularly cancer. Since its expression is positively correlated with poor outcome prognosis for cancer patients, HIF-1 is a target for pharmaceutical therapy. We have previously shown that male germ cell Rac GTPase activating protein (MgcRacGAP), a regulator of Rho proteins which are principally involved in cytoskeletal organization, binds to HIF-1α and inhibits its transcriptional activity. In this work, we have explored the mechanism of the MgcRacGAP-mediated HIF-1 inactivation. We show that the Myo domain of MgcRacGAP, which is both necessary and sufficient for HIF-1 repression, binds to the PAS-B domain of HIF-1α. Furthermore MgcRacGAP competes with ARNT for binding to the HIF-1α PAS-B domain, as shown by in vitro binding pull down assays. In mammalian cells, ARNT overexpression can overcome the MgcRacGAP-mediated inhibition and MgcRacGAP binding to HIF-1α in vivo inhibits its dimerization with ARNT. We additionally present results indicating that MgcRacGAP binding to HIF-1α is specific, since it does not affect the transcriptional activity of HIF-2, a close evolutionary relative of HIF-1 also involved in hypoxia regulation and cancer. Our results reveal a new mechanism for HIF-1 transcriptional activity regulation, suggest a novel hypoxia-cytoskeleton link and provide new tools for selective HIF-1 inhibition.

Abstract: Protein aggregation is linked to many pathological conditions, including several neurodegenerative diseases. The aggregation propensities of proteins are thought to be controlled to a large extent by the physicochemical properties encoded in the primary sequence. We have previously exploited a set of amyloid β peptide (Aβ42) variants exhibiting a continuous gradient of intrinsic aggregation propensities to demonstrate that this rule applies in vivo in bacteria. In the present work we have characterized the behavior of these Aβ42 mutants when expressed in yeast. In contrast to bacteria, the intrinsic aggregation propensity is gated by yeast, in such a way that this property correlates with the formation of intracellular inclusions only above a specific aggregation threshold. Proteins displaying solubility levels above this threshold escape the inclusion formation pathway. In addition, the most aggregation-prone variants are selectively cleared by the yeast quality control degradation machinery. Thus, both inclusion formation and proteolysis target the same aggregation-prone variants and cooperate to minimize the presence of these potentially dangerous species in the cytosol. The demonstration that sorting to these pathways in eukaryotes is strongly influenced by protein primary sequence should facilitate the development of rational approaches to predict and hopefully prevent in vivo protein deposition.

Abstract: Arsenic is a double-edge sword. On the one hand it is powerful carcinogen and on the other it is used therapeutically to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here we report that arsenic activates the iron responsive transcription factor, Aft1, as a consequence of a defective high-affinity iron uptake mediated by Fet3 and Ftr1, whose mRNAs are drastically decreased upon arsenic exposure. Moreover, arsenic causes the internalization and degradation of Fet3. Most importantly, fet3ftr1 mutant exhibits increased arsenic resistance and decreased arsenic accumulation over the wild-type suggesting that Fet3 plays a role in arsenic toxicity. Finally we provide data suggesting that arsenic also disrupts iron uptake in mammals and the link between Fet3, arsenic and iron, can be relevant to clinical applications.

Abstract: The prominent role of Ca2+ in cell physiology is mediated by a whole set of proteins involved in Ca2+-signal generation, deciphering and arrest. Among these intracellular proteins, calmodulin (CaM) known as a prototypical calcium sensor, serves as a ubiquitous carrier of the intracellular calcium signal in all eukaryotic cell types. CaM is assumed to be involved in many diseases including Parkinson, Alzheimer, and rheumatoid arthritis. Defects in some of many reaction partners of CaM might be responsible for disease symptoms. Several classes of drugs bind to CaM with unwanted side effects rather than specific therapeutic use. Thus, it may be more promising to concentrate at searching for pharmacological interferences with the CaM target proteins, in order to find tools for dissecting and investigating CaM-regulatory and modulatory functions in cells. In the present study, we have established a screening assay based on fluorescence polarization (FP) to identify a diverse set of small molecules that disrupt the regulatory function of CaM. The FP-based CaM assay consists in the competition of two fluorescent probes and a library of chemical compounds for binding to CaM. Screening of about 5300 compounds (Strasbourg Academic Library) by displacement of the probe yielded 39 compounds in a first step, from which 6 were selected. Those 6 compounds were characterized by means of calorimetry studies and by competitive displacement of two fluorescent probes interacting with CaM. Moreover, those small molecules were tested for their capability to displace 8 different CaM binding domains from CaM. Our results show that these CaM/small molecules interactions are not functionally equivalent. The strategy that has been set up for CaM is a general model for the development and validation of other CaM interactors, to decipher their mode of action, or rationally design more specific CaM antagonists. Moreover, this strategy may be used for other protein binding assays intended to screen for molecules with preferred binding activity. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 12th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Here, we investigated the influence of Rac family small GTPases on mechanisms of the DNA damage response (DDR) stimulated by topoisomerase II poisons. To this end, we examined the influence of the Rac-specific small molecule inhibitor EHT1864 on Ser139 phosphorylation of histone H2AX, a widely used marker of the DDR triggered by DNA double-strand breaks. EHT1864 attenuated the doxorubicin-stimulated DDR in a subset of cell lines tested, including HepG2 hepatoma cells. EHT1864 reduced the level of DNA strand breaks and increased viability following treatment of HepG2 cells with topo II poisons. Protection by EHT1864 was observed in both p53 wildtype (HepG2) and p53 deficient (Hep3B) human hepatoma cells and, furthermore, remained unaffected upon pharmacological inhibition of p53 in HepG2. Apparently, the impact of Rac on the DDR is independent of p53. Protection from doxorubicin-induced DNA damage by EHT1864 comprises both S and G2 phase cells. The inhibitory effect of EHT1864 on doxorubicin-stimulated DDR was mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of various protein kinases, including JNK, ERK, PI3K, PAK and CK1. EHT1864 and protein kinase inhibitors also attenuated the formation of the topo II-DNA cleavable complex. Moreover, EHT1864 mitigated the constitutive phosphorylation of topoisomerase IIα at positions S1106, S1213 and S1247. Doxorubicin transport, nuclear import/export of topoisomerase II and Hsp90-related mechanisms are likely not of relevance for doxorubicin-stimulated DDR impaired by EHT1864. We suggest that multiple kinase-dependent but p53- and heat shock protein-independent Rac-regulated nuclear mechanisms are required for activation of the DDR following treatment with topo II poisons.

Abstract: FE65 proteins constitute a family of adaptors which modulates the processing of amyloid precursor protein and the consequent amyloid β production. Thus, they have been involved in the complex and partially unknown cascade of reactions at the base of Alzheimer's disease etiology. However, FE65 and FE65-like proteins may be linked to neurodegeneration through the regulation of cell cycle in post-mitotic neurons. In this work we disclose novel molecular mechanisms by which APBB2 can modulate APP processing. We show that APBB2 mRNA splicing, driven by the over-expression of a novel non-coding RNA named 45A, allow the generation of alternative protein forms endowed with differential effects on Aβ production, cell cycle control, and DNA damage response. 45A overexpression also favors cell transformation and tumorigenesis leading to a marked increase of malignancy of neuroblastoma cells. Therefore, our results highlight a novel regulatory pathway of considerable interest linking APP processing with cell cycle regulation and DNA-surveillance systems, that may represent a molecular mechanism to induce neurodegeneration in post-mitotic neurons.

Abstract: Podocyte number is significantly reduced in diabetic patients and animal models, but the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we found that high glucose induced apoptosis in control podocytes which express transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channels, but not in TRPC6 knockdown podocytes in which TRPC6 was knocked down by TRPC6 silencing short hairpin RNA (shRNA). This effect was reproduced by treatment of podocytes with the reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Single-channel data from cell-attached, patch-clamp experiments showed that both high glucose and H2O2 activated the TRPC6 channel in control podocytes, but not in TRPC6 knockdown podocytes. Confocal microscopy showed that high glucose elevated ROS in podocytes and that H2O2 reduced the membrane potential of podocytes and elevated intracellular Ca2+ via activation of TRPC6. Since intracellular Ca2+ overload induces apoptosis, H2O2-induced apoptosis may result from TRPC6-mediated elevation of intracellular Ca2+. These data together suggest that high glucose induces apoptosis in podocytes by stimulating TRPC6 via elevation of ROS.

Abstract: RTN1A is a reticulon protein with predominant localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It was previously shown that RTN1A is expressed in neurons of the mammalian central nervous system but functional information remains sparse. To elucidate the neuronal function of RTN1A, we chose to focus our investigation on identifying possible novel binding partners specifically interacting with the unique N-terminus of RTN1A. Using a nonbiased approach involving GST pull-downs and MS analysis, we identified the intracellular calcium release channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) as a direct binding partner of RTN1A. The RyR2 binding site was localized to a highly conserved 150-amino acid residue region. RTN1A displays high preference for RyR2 binding in vitro and in vivo and both proteins colocalize in hippocampal neurons and Purkinje cells. Moreover, we demonstrate the precise subcellular localization of RTN1A in Purkinje cells and show that RTN1A inhibits RyR channels in [3H]ryanodine binding studies on brain synaptosomes. In a functional assay, RTN1A significantly reduced RyR2-mediated Ca2+ oscillations. Thus, RTN1A and RyR2 might act as functional partners in the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics the in neurons.

Abstract: The exact mechanism by which ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) inhibits insulin signaling is not known. ENPP1 contains two somatomedin-B-like domains (i.e. SMB 1 and 2) involved in ENPP1 dimerization in animal cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate if these domains modulate ENPP1 inhibitory activity on insulin signaling in human insulin target cells (HepG2). ENPP1 (ENPP1–3′myc), ENPP1 deleted of SMB 1 (ENPP1-ΔI-3′myc) or of SMB 2 (ENPP1-ΔII-3′myc) domain were cloned in frame with myc tag in mammalian expression vector pRK5. Plasmids were transiently transfected in human liver HepG2 cells. ENPP1 inhibitory activity on insulin signaling, dimerization and protein–protein interaction with insulin receptor (IR), reported to mediate the modulation of ENPP1 inhibitory activity, were studied. As compared to untransfected cells, a progressive increase of ENPP1 inhibitory activity on insulin-induced IR β-subunit autophosphorylation and on Akt-S473 phosphorylation was observed in ENPP1–3′myc, ENPP1-ΔI-3′myc and ENPP1-ΔII-3′myc cells. Under non reducing conditions a 260kDa homodimer, indicating ENPP1 dimerization, was observed. The ratio of non reduced (260kDa) to reduced (130kDa) ENPP1 was significantly decreased by two thirds in ENPP1-ΔII-3′myc vs. ENPP1–3′myc but not in ENPP1-ΔI-3′myc. A similar ENPP1/IR interaction was detectable by co-immunoprecipitation in ENPP1–3′myc, ENPP1-ΔI-3′myc and ENPP1-ΔII-3′myc cells. In conclusion, SMB 1 and SMB 2 are negative modulators of ENPP1 inhibitory activity on insulin signaling. For SMB 2 such effect might be mediated by a positive role on protein dimerization.

Abstract: Intermediate filaments are cytoskeletal elements important for cell architecture. Recently it has been discovered that intermediate filaments are highly dynamic and that they are fundamental for organelle positioning, transport and function thus being an important regulatory component of membrane traffic. We have identified, using the yeast two-hybrid system, vimentin, a class III intermediate filament protein, as a Rab7a interacting protein. Rab7a is a member of the Rab family of small GTPases and it controls vesicular membrane traffic to late endosomes and lysosomes. In addition, Rab7a is important for maturation of phagosomes and autophagic vacuoles. We confirmed the interaction in HeLa cells by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments, and established that the interaction is direct using bacterially expressed recombinant proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis on HeLa cells indicate that Rab7a-positive vesicles sometimes overlap with vimentin filaments. Overexpression of Rab7a causes an increase in vimentin phosphorylation at different sites and causes redistribution of vimentin in the soluble fraction. Consistently, Rab7a silencing causes an increase of vimentin present in the insoluble fraction (assembled). Also, expression of Charcot–Marie–Tooth 2B-causing Rab7a mutant proteins induces vimentin phosphorylation and increases the amount of vimentin in the soluble fraction. Thus, modulation of expression levels of Rab7a wt or expression of Rab7a mutant proteins changes the assembly of vimentin and its phosphorylation state indicating that Rab7a is important for the regulation of vimentin function.

Abstract: Calpain (intracellular Ca2+-dependent protease) and calpastatin (calpain specific endogenous inhibitor) are widely distributed in biological systems, and have been implicated in many cellular physiological and pathological processes. Calpastatin level is of central importance to the control of calpain activity. We demonstrated for the first time that calpastatin is overexpressed in mycoplasma-contaminated cultured cells (SH-SY5Y cells that are infected by a strain of Mycoplasma hyorhinis (NDMh)). We have found that the calpastatin-upregulating activity resides in the mycoplasmal membrane lipoproteins, and is associated with NF-κB activation. Calpain-promoted proteolysis is attenuated in the NDMh lipoprotein-treated cells. Here we show that the NDMh lipoproteins promoted an increase in calpastatin in SH-SY5Y cells via the TLR2/TAK1/NF-κB pathway. The synthetic mycoplasmal lipopeptide MALP-2 and the bacterial lipopeptide PAM3CSK4 (TLR2 agonists) also promoted calpastatin upregulation. LPS (TLR4 agonist) activated NF-κB without calpastatin increase in the cell. In contrast, lipoteichoic acid (TLR2 agonist) upregulated calpastatin not via NF-κB activation, but via the MEK1/ELK1 pathway. Zymosan and peptidoglycan, TLR2 agonists that lack lipids, did not induce calpastatin upregulation. Cell treatment with a calpastatin-upregulating agonist (lipoteichoic acid) led to the attenuation of Ca2+-promoted calpain activity, whereas agonists that do not upregulate calpastatin (LPS, Zymosan) were ineffective. Overall, the results indicate that in these non-immune cells, calpastatin is upregulated by TLR2-agonists containing lipids, with more than one downstream pathway involved. Such agonists may be useful for studying mechanisms and factors involved in calpastatin regulation. In addition, suitable TLR2 agonists may be of interest in devising treatments for pathological processes involving excessive calpain activation.

Abstract: Cytokines released from microglia mediate defensive responses in the brain, but the underlying mechanisms are obscure. One proposed process is that nucleotide leakage or release from surrounding cells is sensed by metabotropic (P2Y) and ionotropic (P2X) purinergic receptors, which may trigger long-term intracellular Ca2+ flux and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) release. Indeed, 3h of exposure to ATP was required to evoke TNF-α release from a murine microglial cell line (MG5). A Ca2+ chelator, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), reduced ATP-induced TNF-α release, suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ is important in this response. Therefore, Ca2+ sensor genes (YC3.6) were transfected into MG5 cells to investigate the Ca2+ dynamics underlying ATP-induced TNF-α release. The results demonstrated ATP-induced biphasic Ca2+ mobilization mediated by P2Y (~5min) and P2X7 receptors (5–30min). Moreover, Ca2+ spiking activity in cell processes progressively increased with a reduction in P2X7 receptor-mediated Ca2+ elevation during 3-h ATP stimulation. Increased Ca2+ spiking activity paralleled the reduction in thapsigargin-sensitive internal Ca2+ stores, dendrite extension, and expression of macrophage scavenger receptors with collagenous structure. The Ca2+ spiking activity was enhanced by a P2X7 receptor antagonist (A438079), but inhibited by a store-operated channel antagonist (SKF96365) or by co-transfection of small interference ribonucleic acid (siRNA) targeted on the channel component (Orai1). Furthermore, ATP-induced TNF-α release was enhanced by A438079 but was inhibited by SKF96365. Because store-operated channels (Stim1/Orai1) were expressed both in MG5 and primary microglial cultures, we suggest that P2X7 receptor signaling inhibits store-operated channels during ATP stimulation, and disinhibition of this process gates TNF-α release from microglial cells.

Abstract: Efficient uptake of iron is of critical importance for growth and viability of microbial cells. Nevertheless, several mechanisms for iron uptake are not yet clearly defined. Here we report that the widely conserved transporter EfeUOB employs an unprecedented dual-mode mechanism for acquisition of ferrous (Fe[II]) and ferric (Fe[III]) iron in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We show that the binding protein EfeO and the permease EfeU form a minimal complex for ferric iron uptake. The third component EfeB is a hemoprotein that oxidizes ferrous iron to ferric iron for uptake by EfeUO. Accordingly, EfeB promotes growth under microaerobic conditions where ferrous iron is more abundant. Notably, EfeB also fulfills a vital role in cell envelope stress protection by eliminating reactive oxygen species that accumulate in the presence of ferrous iron. In conclusion, the EfeUOB system contributes to the high-affinity uptake of iron that is available in two different oxidation states.

Abstract: The steroid receptor coactivator p/CIP, also known as SRC-3, is an oncogene commonly amplified in breast and ovarian cancers. p/CIP is known to associate with coactivator arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) on select estrogen responsive genes. We have shown, using a ChIP-on-chip approach, that in response to stimulation with 17β-estradiol (E2), the p/CIP/CARM1 complex is recruited to 204 proximal promoters in MCF-7 cells. Many of the complex target genes have been previously implicated in signaling pathways related to oncogenesis. Jak2, a member of the Jak/Stat signaling cascade, is one of the direct E2-dependent targets of the p/CIP/CARM1 complex. Following E2-treatment, histone modifications at the Jak2 promoter are reflective of a transcriptionally permissive gene, and modest changes in RNA and protein expression lead us to suggest that an additional factor(s) may be required for a more notable transcriptional and functional response. Bioinformatic examination of the 204 proximal promoter sequences of p/CIP/CARM1 targets supports the idea that transcription factor crosstalk is likely the favored mechanism of E2-dependent p/CIP/CARM1 complex recruitment. This data may have implications towards understanding the oncogenic role of p/CIP in breast cancer and ultimately allow for the identification of new prognostic indicators and/or viable therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Luteinizing hormone receptor undergoes downregulation during preovulatory Luteinizing hormone surge through a post-transcriptional mechanism involving an RNA binding protein designated as LRBP. The present study examined the mechanism by which LRBP induces the degradation of Luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA, specifically the role of decapping of Luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA and the translocation of LRBP-bound Luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA to degradative machinery. Immunoprecipitation of the complex with the 5′cap structure antibody followed by real time PCR analysis showed progressive loss of capped Luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA during downregulation suggesting that Luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA undergoes decapping prior to degradation. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed dissociation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E from the cap structure, a step required for decapping. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation analysis using antibody against the p body marker protein, DCP1A showed that Luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA was associated with the p bodies, the cytoplasmic foci that contain RNA degradative enzymes and decapping complex. Immunohistochemical studies using antibodies against LRBP and DCP1A followed by confocal analysis showed colocalization of LRBP with DCP1A during downregulation. This was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of LRBP with DCP1A. The association of LRBP and Luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA in the p bodies during downregulation was further confirmed by examining the association of a second p body component, rck/p54, using immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation respectively. These data suggest that the association of LRBP with Luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA results in the translocation of the messenger ribonucleoprotein complex to the p bodies leading to decapping and degradation.

Abstract: Both male and female rat growth plate chondrocytes express estrogen receptors (ERs); however 17β-estradiol (E2) induces membrane responses leading to activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), phospholipase C (PLC), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, protein kinase C (PKC), and ultimately mitogen protein kinase (MAPK) only in female cells. This study investigated if these sex-specific responses are due to differences in the actual ERs or in downstream signaling. Western blots and flow cytometry of costochondral cartilage resting zone chondrocytes (RCs) showed 2–3 times more ERα in plasma membranes (PMs) from female cells than male cells. Tunicamycin blocked E2-dependent ER-translocation to the PM, indicating palmitoylation was required. Co-immunoprecipitation showed E2 induced complex formation between ER isoforms only in female RCs. To examine if the lack of response in PKC and PGE2 in males is due to differences in signaling, we examined involvement of ERs and the role of PLC and PLA2. Selective ERα (propylpyrazole triol, PPT) and ERβ (diarylproprionitrile, DPN) agonists activated PKC in female RCs only. The PLC inhibitor, U73122 blocked E2's effect on PKC and the cytosolic PLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3 inhibited the effect on PGE2 in female RCs, confirming involvement of PLC and PLA2 in the mechanism. The PLC activator, m-3M3FβS activated PKC and PLAA peptide increased PGE2 levels in male and female RCs, showing that the signaling pathways are present. These data indicate that differences in membrane ER amount, localization, translocation and interaction are responsible for the sexual dimorphic response to E2.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread, age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Its two subtypes are sporadic AD (SAD) of unknown etiology and genetically encoded familial AD (FAD). The onset of AD is often preceded by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Calcium dynamics were found to be dysregulated in FAD models, but little is known about the features of calcium dynamics in SAD. To explore calcium homeostasis during the early stages of SAD, we investigated store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated calcium release into the cytoplasm in unmodified B lymphocytes from MCI and SAD patients and compared them with non-demented subjects (NDS). Calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum and both the rising and falling SOCE slopes were very similar in all three groups. However, we found that SAD and MCI cells were more prone to IP3R activation than NDS cells, and increases in calcium levels in the cytoplasm were almost twice as frequent in SAD cells than in NDS cells. MCI cells and SAD cells exhibited an enhanced magnitude of calcium influx during SOCE. MCI cells but not SAD cells were characterized by higher basal cellular calcium levels than NDS cells. In summary, perturbed calcium homeostasis was observed in peripheral cells from MCI and SAD patients. Thus, lymphocytes obtained from MCI subjects may be promising in the early diagnosis of individuals who will eventually develop SAD. However, no conclusions are made regarding SAD due to the limited number patients. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 12th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can modulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. This study was designed to investigate the epigenetic control of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to H2S. Microarray analysis indicated that Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1) and proliferation-related genes including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna), neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) and platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (Pdgfα) were significantly downregulated by H2S in endothelin-1-stimulated proliferative vascular smooth muscle cells. Brg1 is the central catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF apparatus (an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex). Overexpression and knockdown of Brg1 confirmed that Brg1 was crucial for H2S-induced inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. A luciferase reporter assay, real-time PCR and Western blotting demonstrated that H2S inhibited Brg1 transcription and expression. A DNase I hypersensitivity assay revealed that H2S reversed endothelin-1-stimulated Pcna, Ntf3 and Pdgfα chromatin remodeling and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that H2S inhibited the recruitment of Brg1 to the Pcna, Ntf3 and Pdgfα promoters. The results of this study indicate that H2S inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via an epigenetic mechanism involving the inhibition of Brg1 transcription and expression, and by reducing the recruitment of Brg1 to the Pcna, Ntf3 and Pdgfα promoter regions.

Abstract: T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, TCPTP, is a ubiquitously expressed non-receptor type tyrosine phosphatase. There are two splice variants of TCPTP, TC48 and TC45, which differ in their sub-cellular localizations and functions. TC45 is a nuclear protein, which has both nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates, and is involved in many signaling events including endocytic recycling of platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor. TC48 is a predominantly endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localizing protein, which dephosphorylates some of the substrates of TC45 at the ER. However, recently few specific substrates for TC48 have been identified. These include C3G (RapGEF1), syntaxin 17 and BCR-Abl. TC48 moves from the ER to post-ER compartments, the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi, and it is retrieved back to the ER. The retrieval of ER proteins from post-ER compartments is generally believed as a mechanism of targeting these proteins to the ER. However, it is possible that this shuttling of TC48 serves to regulate signaling in the early secretory pathway. For example, TC48 dephosphorylates phosphorylated C3G at the Golgi and inhibits neurite outgrowth. TC48 interacts with and dephosphorylates syntaxin 17, which is an ER and ERGIC-localizing protein involved in vesicle transport. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified several unique interacting partners of TC48 belonging to two groups — proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and proteins involved in cell adhesion. These interacting proteins could be substrates or regulators of TC48 function and localization. Thus, the role of TC48 seems to be more diverse, which is still to be explored.

Abstract: The success of pharmacological treatments in primary liver cancers is limited by the marked efficacy of mechanisms of chemoresistance already present in hepatocytes. The role of the nuclear receptor FXR is unclear. Although, in non-treated liver tumors, its expression is reduced, the refractoriness to anticancer drugs is high. Moreover, the treatment with cisplatin up-regulates FXR. The aim of this study was to investigate whether FXR is involved in stimulating chemoprotection/chemoresistance in healthy and tumor liver cells. In human hepatocytes, the activation of FXR with the agonist GW4064 resulted in a significant protection against cisplatin-induced toxicity. In human hepatoma Alexander cells, with negligible endogenous expression of FXR, GW4064 also protected against cisplatin-induced toxicity, but only if they were previously transfected with FXR/RXR. Investigation of 109 genes potentially involved in chemoresistance revealed that only ABCB4, TCEA2, CCL14, CCL15 and KRT13 were up-regulated by FXR activation both in human hepatocytes and FXR/RXR-expressing hepatoma cells. In both models, cisplatin, even in the absence of FXR agonists, such as bile acids and GW4064, was able to up-regulate FXR targets genes, which was due to FXR-mediated trans-activation of response elements in the promoter region. FXR-dependent chemoprotection was also efficient against other DNA-damaging compounds, such as doxorubicin, mitomycin C and potassium dichromate, but not against non-genotoxic drugs, such as colchicine, paclitaxel, acetaminophen, artesunate and sorafenib. In conclusion, ligand-dependent and independent activation of FXR stimulates mechanisms able to enhance the chemoprotection of hepatocytes against genotoxic compounds and to reduce the response of liver tumor cells to certain pharmacological treatments.

Abstract: The centrosome/basal body protein ODF2/Cenexin is necessary for the formation of the primary cilium. Primary cilia are essential organelles that sense and transduce environmental signals. Primary cilia are therefore critical for embryonic and postnatal development as well as for tissue homeostasis in adulthood. Impaired function of primary cilia causes severe human diseases. ODF2 deficiency prevents formation of the primary cilium and is embryonically lethal. To explore the regulation of primary cilia formation we analyzed the promoter region of Odf2 and its transcriptional activity. In cycling cells, Odf2 transcription is depressed but becomes up-regulated in quiescent cells. Low transcriptional activity is mediated by sequences located upstream from the basal promoter, and neither transcription factors with predicted binding sites in the Odf2 promoter nor Rfx3 or Foxj, which are known to control ciliary gene expression, could activate Odf2 transcription. However, co-expression of either C/EBPα, c-Jun or c-Jun and its regulator MEKK1 enhances Odf2 transcription in cycling cells. Our results provide the first analysis of transcriptional regulation of a ciliary gene. Furthermore, we suggest that transcription of even more ciliary genes is largely inhibited in cycling cells but could be activated by cell cycle arrest and by the stress signaling JNK pathway.

Abstract: A1/Bfl-1 is a NF-κB dependent, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that contains four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH) and an amphipathic C-terminal domain, and is expressed in endothelial cells (EC). Based on NF-κB reporter assays in bovine aortic EC, we have previously demonstrated that A1, like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, inhibits NF-κB activation. These results, however, do not fully translate when evaluating the cell's own NF-κB machinery in human EC overexpressing A1 by means of recombinant adenovirus (rAd.) mediated gene transfer. Indeed, overexpression of full-length A1 in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC), and human dermal microvascular EC (HDMEC) failed to inhibit NF-κB activation. However, overexpression of a mutant lacking the C-terminal domain of A1 (A1ΔC) demonstrated a potent NF-κB inhibitory effect in these cells. Disparate effects of A1 and A1ΔC on NF-κB inhibition in human EC correlated with mitochondrial (A1) versus non-mitochondrial (A1ΔC) localization. In contrast, both full-length A1 and A1ΔC protected EC from staurosporine (STS)-induced cell death, indicating that mitochondrial localization was not necessary for A1's cytoprotective function in human EC. In conclusion, our data uncover a regulatory role for the C-terminal domain of A1 in human EC: anchoring A1 to the mitochondrion, which conserves but is not necessary for its cytoprotective function, or by its absence freeing A1 from the mitochondrion and uncovering an additional anti-inflammatory effect.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths, worldwide. MicroRNAs, inhibiting gene expression by targeting various transcripts, are involved in genomic dysregulation during hepatocellular tumorigenesis. In previous studies, microRNA-198 (miR-198) was shown to be significantly downregulated in HCV-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, the function of miR-198 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth and gene expression was studied. In hepatoma cell-types with low levels of liver-specific transcription factor HNF1α indicating a low differentiation grade, miR-198 expression was most downregulated. However, miR-198 treatment did not restore the expression of the liver-specific transcription factors HNF1α or HNF4α. Importantly, overexpression of miR-198 in Pop10 hepatoma cells markedly reduced cell growth. In agreement, comprehensive gene expression profiling by microarray hybridisation and real-time quantification revealed that central signal transducers of proliferation pathways were downregulated by miR-198. In contrast, genes mediating cellular adherence were highly upregulated by miR-198. Thus, the low expression of E-cadherin and claudin-1, involved in cell adhesion and cell-cell contacts, was abolished in hepatoma cells after miR-198 overexpression. This definite induction of both proteins by miR-198 was shown to be accompanied by a significantly impaired migration activity of hepatoma Pop10 cells. In conclusion, miR-198 acts as a tumor suppressor by repression of mitogenic and motogenic pathways diminishing cell growth and migration.

Abstract: TRPA1 is a non-selective Ca2+ permeable channel located in the plasma membrane that functions as a cellular sensor detecting mechanical, chemical and thermal stimuli, being a component of neuronal, epithelial, blood and smooth muscle tissues. TRPA1 has been shown to influence a broad range of physiological processes that involve Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways. Here we report that TRPA1 is expressed in MEG01 but not in platelets at the protein level. MEG01 cells maturation induced by PMA results in attenuation of TRPA1 protein expression and enhances thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ entry without altering the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Inhibition of TRPA1 by HC-030031 results in enhancement of both thrombin- and thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that TRPA1 associates with STIM1, as well as Orai1, TRPC1 and TRPC6. Downregulation of TRPA1 expression by MEG01 maturation, as well as pharmacological inhibition of TRPA1 by HC-030031, results in enhancement of the association between STIM1 and Orai1. Altogether, these findings provide evidence for a new and interesting function of TRPA1 in cellular function associated to the regulation of agonist-induced Ca2+ entry by the modulation of STIM1/Orai1 interaction.

Abstract: Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have been widely applied in several clinical trials of diseases, such as myocardial infarction, liver cirrhosis, neurodegenerative disease, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Although most studies demonstrated that transplantation of BM-MSCs did exert a temporary relief and short-term therapeutic effects, eventually all symptoms recur, therefore it is essential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of transplantation by either elevating the self-renewal of BM-MSCs or enhancing their survival rate. Herein we demonstrated that the BM-MSCs and adipocyte derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) isolated from the androgen receptor (AR) knockout mice have higher self-renewal ability than those obtained from the wild-type mice. Knockdown of AR in MSC cell lines exhibited similar results. Mechanistic dissection studies showed that the depletion of AR resulted in activation of Erk and Akt signaling pathways through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation or pathway to mediate higher self-renewal of BM-MSCs. Targeting AR signals using ASC-J9® (an AR degradation enhancer), hydroxyflutamide (antagonist of AR), and AR-siRNA all led to enhanced self-renewal of MSCs, suggesting the future possibility of using these anti-AR agents in therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: The NIMA-related kinases (NRK or Nek) are emerging as conserved and crucial regulators of mitosis and cilia formation. The microtubule (MT) network has long been suspected as a major target of the Neks. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Using the PlusTipTracker software, recently developed by the Danuser group, we followed the consequences of alterations in Nek7 levels on MT dynamic instability. siRNA-mediated downregulation of Nek7 in HeLa cells resulted in lower speeds of MT growth and catastrophe, reduction of the relative time spent in catastrophe, and considerably lowered the overall MT dynamicity. Co-expression of Nek7 with the siRNA treatment rescued the MT phenotypes, while ectopic overexpression of Nek7 yielded inverse characteristics compared to Nek7 downregulation. MT dynamics in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from targeted null mutants for Nek7 recapitulated the siRNA downregulation phenotypes. Precise MT dynamic instability is critical for accurate shaping of the mitotic spindle and for cilium formation, and higher MT dynamicity is associated with tumorigenicity. Thus, our results can supply a mechanistic explanation for Nek involvement in these processes.

Abstract: Exogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances Ca2+ signaling and cell proliferation in human airway smooth muscle (ASM), especially with inflammation. Human ASM also expresses BDNF, raising the potential for autocrine/paracrine effects. The mechanisms by which ASM BDNF secretion occurs are not known. Transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) regulate a variety of intracellular processes including store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE; including in ASM) and secretion of factors such as cytokines. In human ASM, we tested the hypothesis that TRPC3 regulates BDNF secretion. At baseline, intracellular BDNF was present, and BDNF secretion was detectable by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of cell supernatants or by real-time fluorescence imaging of cells transfected with GFP–BDNF vector. Exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) (20ng/ml, 48h) or a mixture of allergens (ovalbumin, house dust mite, Alternaria, and Aspergillus extracts) significantly enhanced BDNF secretion and increased TRPC3 expression. TRPC3 knockdown (siRNA or inhibitor Pyr3; 10μM) blunted BDNF secretion, and prevented inflammation effects. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ (EGTA; 1mM) or intracellular Ca2+ (BAPTA; 5μM) significantly reduced secreted BDNF, as did the knockdown of SOCE proteins STIM1 and Orai1 or plasma membrane caveolin-1. Functionally, secreted BDNF had autocrine effects suggested by phosphorylation of high-affinity tropomyosin-related kinase TrkB receptor, prevented by chelating extracellular BDNF with chimeric TrkB-Fc. These data emphasize the role of TRPC3 and Ca2+ influx in the regulation of BDNF secretion by human ASM and the enhancing effects of inflammation. Given the BDNF effects on Ca2+ and cell proliferation, BDNF secretion may contribute to altered airway structure and function in diseases such as asthma.

Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport mediated by importin proteins is central to many developmental processes, such as precisely regulated germ cell differentiation during spermatogenesis. Here we examine for the first time the dynamic association of importins with cargo during two successive spermatogenic stages: meiotic pachytene spermatocytes and haploid round spermatids of the adult rat testis. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry yielded the first non-biased identification of proteins selectively interacting with importin α2, α3 and α4 in each of these cell types. Amongst the 22 novel importin binding proteins identified, 11 contain a predicted classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) for importin α binding using a new algorithm (Kosugi et al. [22]), although only 6 of these have known nuclear functions. An importin α2-immunoprecipitated protein with a key nuclear role in meiosis, structural maintenance of chromosomes 6 (SMC6), contained a predicted bipartite NLS that was shown to be preferentially recognized by importin α together with importin β1. In contrast, the predicted cNLS of synovial sarcoma, X breakpoint 2 interacting protein (SSX2IP) was found not to confer either nuclear accumulation or direct binding to importin αs, implying that NLS prediction algorithms may identify cryptic importin binding sites or require additional refinement to increase their accuracy. Unbiased identification of importin α binding proteins in cellular differentiation represents a powerful tool to help identify the functional roles of importin αs.

Abstract: The Warburg effect is known to be crucial for cancer cells to acquire energy. Nutrient deficiencies are an important phenomenon in solid tumors, but the effect on cancer cell metabolism is not yet clear. In this study, we demonstrate that starvation of HeLa cells by incubation with Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) induced cell apoptosis, which was accompanied by the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Notably, HBSS starvation increased lactate production, cytoplasmic pyruvate content and decreased oxygen consumption, but failed to change the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity or the glucose uptake. We found that HBSS starvation rapidly induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activation and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation, both of which were inhibited by compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), NAC (a ROS scavenger), and the dominant negative mutant of AMPK. Our data further revealed the involvement of ROS production in AMPK activation. Moreover, DCA (a PDK inhibitor), NAC, and compound C all significantly decreased HBSS starvation-induced lactate production accompanied by enhancement of HBSS starvation-induced cell apoptosis. Not only in HeLa cells, HBSS-induced lactate production and PDH phosphorylation were also observed in CL1.5, A431 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Taken together, we for the first time demonstrated that a low-nutrient condition drives cancer cells to utilize glycolysis to produce ATP, and this increases the Warburg effect through a novel mechanism involving ROS/AMPK-dependent activation of PDK. Such an event contributes to protecting cells from apoptosis upon nutrient deprivation.

Abstract: Migration of cells in the ocular surface underpins physiological wound healing as well as many human diseases. Transglutaminase (TG)-2 is a multifunctional cross-linking enzyme involved in the migration of skin fibroblasts and wound healing, however, its functional role in epithelial migration has not been evaluated. This study investigated the importance of TG-2 in a murine corneal wound healing model as well as the mechanistic role of TG-2 in the regulation of related biological processes such as cell adhesion and migration of cultured human corneal epithelial (HCE-T) cells. Corneal wound closure was delayed in homozygous TG-2 deleted mice compared to wild type mice. HCE-T cells that were knocked-down for TG-2 expression through stable expression of a short-hairpin (sh) RNA targeting TG-2, were delayed in closure of scratch wounds (48 compared to 12h in control cells expressing scrambled shRNA). TG-2 knockdown did not influence epithelial cell cycle progression or proliferation, rather, it led to reduced epithelial cell adhesion, spreading and velocity of migration. At the molecular level, TG-2 knockdown reduced phosphorylation of β-3 integrin at Tyr747, paxillin at Ser178, vinculin at Tyr822 and focal adhesion kinase at Tyr925 simultaneous with reduced activation of Rac and CDC42. Phosphorylation of paxillin at Ser178A has been shown to be indispensable for the migration of corneal epithelial cells (Kimura et al., 2008) [18]. TG-2 dependent β-3 integrin activation, serine-phosphorylation of paxillin, and Rac and CDC42 activation may thus play a key functional role in enhancing corneal epithelial cell adhesion and migration during wound healing.

Abstract: Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a NAD+-dependent protein modification carried out by PARP [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] enzymes. Here we set out to investigate whether PARylation regulates UVB-induced cell death in primary human keratinocytes. We used the benchmark PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) and a more potent and specific inhibitor PJ34 and found that UVB (0.05–0.2J/cm2) induced a dose dependent loss of viability that was prevented by 3AB but not by PJ34. Similarly to PJ34, two other new generation PARP inhibitors also failed to protect keratinocytes from UVB-induced loss of viability. Moreover, silencing PARP-1 in HaCaT human keratinocytes sensitized cells to UVB toxicity but 3AB provided protection to both control HaCaT cells and to PARP-1 silenced cells indicating that the photoprotective effect of 3AB is independent of PARP inhibition. Lower UVB doses (0.0125–0.05J/cm2) caused inhibition of proliferation of keratinocytes which was prevented by 3AB but augmented by PJ34. UVB-induced keratinocyte death displayed the characteristics of both apoptosis (morphology, caspase activity, DNA fragmentation) and necrosis (morphology, LDH release) with all of these parameters being inhibited by 3AB and apoptotic parameters slightly enhanced by PJ34. UVA also caused apoptotic and necrotic cell death in keratinocytes with 3AB protecting and PJ34 sensitizing cells to UVA-induced toxicity. 3AB prevented UVB-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and generation of hydrogen peroxide. In summary, PARylation is a survival mechanism in UV-treated keratinocytes. Moreover, 3-aminobenzamide is photoprotective and acts by a PARP-independent mechanism at a premitochondrial step of phototoxicity.

Abstract: Despite its potential side effects of addiction, tolerance and withdrawal symptoms, morphine is widely used for reducing moderate and severe pain. Previous studies have shown that the analgesic effect of morphine depends on mu opioid receptor (MOR) expression levels, but the regulatory mechanism of MOR is not yet fully understood. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is closely associated with neuropathic hyperalgesia, which closely resembles the neuroplastic changes observed with morphine antinociceptive tolerance. In this study, we show that inhibition of JNK by SP600125, its inhibitory peptide, or JNK-1 siRNA induced MOR at both mRNA and protein levels in neuronal cells. This increase in MOR expression was reversed by inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but not by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) pathway. Further experiments using cell signaling inhibitors showed that MOR upregulation by JNK inhibition involved nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). The p38 MAPK dependent phosphorylation of p65 NF-κB subunit in the nucleus was increased by SP600125 treatment. We also observed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis that JNK inhibition led to increased bindings of CBP and histone-3 dimethyl K4, and decreased bindings of HDAC-2, MeCP2, and histone-3 trimethyl K9 to the MOR promoter indicating a transcriptional regulation of MOR by JNK inhibition. All these results suggest a regulatory role of the p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways in MOR gene expression and aid to our better understanding of the MOR gene regulation.

Abstract: Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), an important phosphatase in dephosphorylating tau and preserving synapse, is significantly suppressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism is not well understood. Here, we studied whether phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator (PTPA) could activate PP2A by reducing its inhibitory phosphorylation at tyrosine 307 (P-PP2AC). We found that overexpression of PTPA activated PP2A by decreasing the level of P-PP2AC with reduced phosphorylation of tau, while knockdown of PTPA inhibited PP2A by increasing the level of P-PP2AC with enhanced tau phosphorylation. We also observed that expression of PTPA could upregulate the protein and mRNA levels of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and simultaneous downregulation of PTP1B eliminated PTPA-induced PP2A activation. Importantly, we also found that the protein level of PTPA is downregulated in the brains of AD patients, and the AD transgenic mouse models with expression of mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) or the longest human tau (htau), respectively. Our data indicate that PTPA may activate PP2A through activating PTP1B and thus reducing the level of P-PP2AC, therefore upregulation of PTPA may represent a potential strategy in rescuing PP2A and arresting tau pathology in AD.

Abstract: The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), located at the outer mitochondria membrane (OMM), mediates interactions between mitochondria and other parts of the cell by transporting anions, cations, ATP, Ca2+, and metabolites. Substantial evidence points to VDAC1 as being a key player in apoptosis, regulating the release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria, such as cytochrome c, and interacting with anti-apoptotic proteins. Recently, we demonstrated that VDAC1 oligomerization is a general mechanism common to numerous apoptogens acting via different initiating cascades and proposed that a protein-conducting channel formed within a VDAC1 homo/hetero oligomer mediates cytochrome c release. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for VDAC1 oligomerization remains unclear. Several studies have shown that mitochondrial Ca2+ is involved in apoptosis induction and that VDAC1 possesses Ca2+-binding sites and mediates Ca2+ transport across the OMM. Here, the relationship between the cellular Ca2+ level, [Ca2+]i, VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis was studied. Decreasing [Ca2+]i using the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelating reagent BAPTA-AM was found to inhibit VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis, while increasing [Ca2+]i using Ca2+ ionophore resulted in VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis induction in the absence of apoptotic stimuli. Moreover, induction of apoptosis elevated [Ca2+]i, concomitantly with VDAC1 oligomerization. AzRu-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport decreased VDAC1 oligomerization, suggesting that mitochondrial Ca2+ is required for VDAC1 oligomerization. In addition, increased [Ca2+]i levels up-regulate VDAC1 expression. These results suggest that Ca2+ promotes VDAC1 oligomerization via activation of a yet unknown signaling pathway or by increasing VDAC1 expression, leading to apoptosis.

Abstract: Foregut neuroendocrine tumors [NETs] usually pursuit a benign course, but some show aggressive behavior. The treatment of patients with advanced NETs is marginally effective and new approaches are needed. In other tumors, transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) by growth factors, gastrointestinal (GI) hormones and lipids can stimulate growth, which has led to new treatments. Recent studies show a direct correlation between NET malignancy and EGFR expression, EGFR inhibition decreases basal NET growth and an autocrine growth effect exerted by GI hormones, for some NETs. To determine if GI hormones can stimulate NET growth by inducing transactivation of EGFR, we examined the ability of EGF, TGFα and various GI hormones to stimulate growth of the human foregut carcinoid,BON, the somatostatinoma QGP-1 and the rat islet tumor,Rin-14B-cell lines. The EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, AG1478 strongly inhibited EGF and the GI hormones stimulated cell growth, both in BON and QGP-1 cells. In all the three neuroendocrine cell lines studied, we found EGF, TGFα and the other growth-stimulating GI hormones increased Tyr1068 EGFR phosphorylation. In BON cells, both the GI hormones neurotensin and a bombesin analogue caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in EGFR phosphorylation, which was strongly inhibited by AG1478. Moreover, we found this stimulated phosphorylation was dependent on Src kinases, PKCs, matrix metalloproteinase activation and the generation of reactive oxygen species. These results raise the possibility that disruption of this signaling cascade by either EGFR inhibition alone or combined with receptor antagonists may be a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of foregut NETs/PETs.

Abstract: Claudin-4 is exclusively localized in the tight collecting ducts in the renal tubule. We examined what molecular mechanism is involved in the regulation of claudin-4 expression. In Madin–Darby canine kidney cells, hyperosmolarity increased the expression level of claudin-4 and the production of reactive oxygen species, which were inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid)porphyrin (MnTBAP), a scavenger of H2O2. Both hyperosmolarity and H2O2 increased p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK, which were inhibited by U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, respectively. Immunoprecipitation assay showed that hyperosmolarity increased the association of nuclear Sp1 with c-Jun, which was inhibited by U0126 and SP600125. In mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells and rat kidney slices, hyperosmolarity increased the expression level of claudin-4, which was inhibited by DPI, MnTBAP, U0126, and SP600125. Hyperosmolarity increased luciferase reporter activity of claudin-4, which was inhibited by U0126, SP600125, Sp1 siRNA, and c-Jun siRNA. The activity was inhibited by the mutation in the Sp1 binding site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and avidin–biotin conjugated DNA assay showed that Sp1 and c-Jun are associated with the Sp1 binding site. These results suggest that hyperosmolarity increases nuclear Sp1/c-Jun complex and the association of the complex with the Sp1 binding site, resulting in the segment-specific expression of claudin-4 in the kidney.

Abstract: Both synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) have been shown to be critical for nuclear calcium signals associated with transcriptional responses to bursts of synaptic input. However the direct contribution to nuclear calcium signals from calcium influx through NMDA receptors and VOCCs has been obscured by their concurrent roles in action potential generation and synaptic transmission. Here we compare calcium responses to synaptically induced bursts of action potentials with identical bursts devoid of any synaptic contribution generated using the pre-recorded burst as the voltage clamp command input to replay the burst in the presence of blockers of action potentials or ionotropic glutamate receptors. Synapse independent replays of bursts produced nuclear calcium responses with amplitudes around 70% of their original synaptically generated signals and were abolished by the L-type VOCC blocker, verapamil. These results identify a major direct source of nuclear calcium from local L-type VOCCs whose activation is boosted by NMDA receptor dependent depolarization. The residual component of synaptically induced nuclear calcium signals which was both VOCC independent and NMDA receptor dependent showed delayed kinetics consistent with a more distal source such as synaptic NMDA receptors or internal stores. The dual requirement of NMDA receptors and L-type VOCCs for synaptic activity-induced nuclear calcium dependent transcriptional responses most likely reflects a direct somatic calcium influx from VOCCs whose activation is amplified by synaptic NMDA receptor-mediated depolarization and whose calcium signal is boosted by a delayed input from distal calcium sources mostly likely entry through NMDA receptors and release from internal stores. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 12th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Proprotein convertases (PCs) form a group of serine endoproteases that are essential for the activation of proproteins into their active form. Some PCs have been proposed to be potential therapeutic targets for cancer intervention because elevated PC activity has been observed in many different cancer types and because many of the PC substrates, such as pro-IGF-1R, pro-TGF-beta, pro-VEGF, are involved in signaling pathways related to tumor development. Curcumin, reported to possess anticancer activity, also affects many of these pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of curcumin on PC activity. Our results show that curcumin inhibits PC activity in a cell lysate-based assay but not in vitro. PC zymogen maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum appears to be inhibited by curcumin. Treating cells with thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid, two structurally unrelated inhibitors of the sarco- and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA), also hampered both the PC zymogen maturation and the PC activity. Importantly, curcumin, like the SERCA inhibitors, impaired ATP-driven 45Ca2+ uptake in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that curcumin likely restrains PC activity by inhibiting SERCA-mediated Ca2+-uptake activity. Experiments in three colon cancer cell lines confirm that curcumin inhibits both the 45Ca2+ uptake and PC activity, notably the processing of pro-IGF-1R. Both curcumin and thapsigargin inhibit the anchorage-independent growth of these three colon carcinoma cell lines. In conclusion, our findings indicate that curcumin inhibits PC zymogen maturation and consequently PC activity and that its inhibitory effect on Ca2+ uptake into the ER allows and is sufficient to explain this phenomenon.

Abstract: RNA interference (RNAi) is an essential method in molecular biology to reduce the expression of target genes and thereby determine their function. Since this tool is known to also have unspecific effects, control experiments are needed, chiefly among them the exclusion of off-target effects and the reconstitution of the genes' expression for the rescue of the cellular RNAi effects. We show here that the knock-down of the mitochondrial creatine kinase-1 (CKMT1) by RNA interference causes the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential ΔΨm. This was accomplished with 11 different RNAi constructs designed to target 7 distinct exons as well as exon/intron junctions making unspecific off-target effects unlikely. However, all our attempts failed to rescue human cells from ΔΨm dissipation by the expression of CKMT1 alleles not targeted by RNAi. This included the transient and stable expression of the murine CKMT1 homologue, the expression of human codon usage-modified alleles, the transfection of a novel splice-isoform of CKMT1, and even the introduction of a human genomic clone for CKMT1 with codon usage changes. Our results indicate that while off-target effects of RNA interference can easily be addressed, the rescue of the knock-down phenotype is not necessarily achievable.

Platelet-derived growth factor negatively regulates the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway through the coordinated action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C beta I,

Abstract: We recently described that epidermal and fibroblast growth factors (EGF and FGF) regulate the IGF-I signaling pathway at the level of IRS-1 through the cooperative action of two independent signaling pathways; one dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and the other on protein kinase D1 (PKD1) (Karam et al. [22]). To determine whether this mechanism could be generalized to another tyrosine kinase receptor-dependent growth factor, the effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on the IGF-I signaling pathway was studied. PDGF inhibited IGF-I-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent IGF-I-induced PI 3-kinase activity, and stimulated IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation. These effects were mediated through a PI 3-kinase-dependent but extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-independent signaling pathway. However, PDGF-induced IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation was not sufficient per se to inhibit the IGF-I signaling but required another independent pathway. Noteworthy, although acutely stimulated by PDGF, and contrary to what we previously described (Karam et al. [22]), PKD1 did not associate with IRS-1and did not inhibit the IGF-I signaling in response to PDGF. However, we identified PKCβI as a new regulatory partner of PI 3-kinase for PDGF-induced inhibition of the IGF-I signaling pathway. Therefore, our results reinforce the idea that a coordinated action of two independent pathways seems absolutely necessary to negatively regulate IRS-1. Moreover, they also demonstrated that, depending of the cross-talk considered, subtle and specific regulatory mechanisms occur at the level of IRS-1 and that a unique regulatory model is not conceivable.

Abstract: The vanilloid transient receptor potential channel TRPV1 is a molecular integrator of noxious stimuli, including capsaicin, heat and protons. Despite clear similarities between the overall architecture of TRPV1 and voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channels, the extent of conservation in the molecular logic for gating is unknown. In Kv channels, a small contact surface between S1 and the pore-helix is required for channel functioning. To explore the function of S1 in TRPV1, we used tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis and characterized the responses to capsaicin and protons. Wild-type-like currents were generated in 9 out of 17 mutants; three mutants (M445W, A452W, R455W) were non-functional. The conservative mutation R455K in the extracellular extent of S1 slowed down capsaicin-induced activation and prevented normal channel closure. This mutant was neither activated nor potentiated by protons, on the contrary, protons promoted a rapid deactivation of its currents. Similar phenotypes were found in two other gain-of-function mutants and also in the pore-helix mutant T633A, known to uncouple proton activation. We propose that the S1 domain contains a functionally important region that may be specifically involved in TRPV1 channel gating, and thus be important for the energetic coupling between S1–S4 sensor activation and gate opening. Analogous to Kv channels, the S1-pore interface might serve to stabilize conformations associated with TRPV1 channel gating.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in kidney epithelial cells plays a key role in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in chronic kidney diseases. As hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α is found to mediate TGF-β1-induced signaling pathway, we tested the hypothesis that HIF-1α and its upstream regulator prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHDs) are involved in TGF-β1-induced EMT using cultured renal tubular cells. Our results showed that TGF-β1 stimulated EMT in renal tubular cells as indicated by the significant decrease in epithelial marker P-cadherin, and the increase in mesenchymal markers α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP-1). Meanwhile, we found that TGF-β1 time-dependently increased HIF-1α and that HIF-1α siRNA significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT, suggesting that HIF-1α mediated TGF-β1 induced-EMT. Real-time PCR showed that PHD1 and PHD2, rather than PHD3, could be detected, with PHD2 as the predominant form of PHDs (PHD1:PHD2=0.21:1.0). Importantly, PHD2 mRNA and protein, but not PHD1, were decreased by TGF-β1. Furthermore, over-expression of PHD2 transgene almost fully prevented TGF-β1-induced HIF-1α accumulation and EMT marker changes, indicating that PHD2 is involved in TGF-β1-induced EMT. Finally, Smad2/3 inhibitor SB431542 prevented TGF-β1-induced PHD2 decrease, suggesting that Smad2/3 may mediate TGF-β1-induced EMT through PHD2/HIF-1α pathway. It is concluded that TGF-β1 decreased PHD2 expression via an Smad-dependent signaling pathway, thereby leading to HIF-1α accumulation and then EMT in renal tubular cells. The present study suggests that PHD2/HIF-1α is a novel signaling pathway mediating the fibrogenic effect of TGF-β1, and may be a new therapeutic target in chronic kidney diseases.

Abstract: The prion protein (PrP)—known for its central role in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies—has been reported to possess two nuclear localization signals and localize in the nuclei of certain cells in various forms. Although these data are superficially contradictory, it is apparent that nuclear forms of the prion protein can be found in cells in either the healthy or the diseased state. Here we report that Shadoo (Sho)—a member of the prion protein superfamily—is also found in the nucleus of several neural and non-neural cell lines as visualized by using an YFP-Sho construct. This nuclear localization is mediated by the (25-61) fragment of mouse Sho encompassing an (RXXX)8 motif. Bioinformatic analysis shows that the (RXXX)n motif (n=7-8) is a highly conserved and characteristic part of mammalian Shadoo proteins. Experiments to assess if Sho enters the nucleus by facilitated transport gave no decisive results: the inhibition of active processes that require energy in the cell, abolishes nuclear but not nucleolar accumulation. However, the (RXXX)8 motif is not able to mediate the nuclear transport of large fusion constructs exceeding the size limit of the nuclear pore for passive entry. Tracing the journey of various forms of Sho from translation to the nucleus and discerning the potential nuclear function of PrP and Sho requires further studies.

Abstract: Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a group of rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding tendency, and sporadic pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis or infections. Nine HPS-causing genes have been identified in humans. HPS-1 is the most severe subtype with a prevalence of ~1/1800 in northwest Puerto Rico due to a founder mutation in the HPS1 gene. Mutations in HPS genes affect the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes in melanocytes and platelet dense granules. Two of these genes (HPS1 and HPS4) encode the HPS1 and HPS4 proteins, which assemble to form a complex known as Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelle Complex 3 (BLOC-3). We report the identification of the interacting regions in HPS1 and HPS4 required for the formation of this complex. Two regions in HPS1, spanning amino acids 1–249 and 506–700 are required for binding to HPS4; the middle portion of HPS1 (residues 250–505) is not required for this interaction. Further interaction studies showed that the N-termini of HPS1 and HPS4 interact with each other and that a discrete region of HPS4 (residues 340–528) interacts with both the N- and C-termini of the HPS1 protein. Several missense mutations found in HPS-1 patients did not affect interaction with HPS4, but some mutations involving regions interacting with HPS4 caused instability of HPS1. These observations extend our understanding of BLOC-3 assembly and represent an important first step in the identification of domains responsible for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles.

Abstract: We used the perforated whole-cell recording technique to examine the effect of with-no-lysine kinase 4 (WNK4) on the Ca2+ activated big-conductance K channels (BK) in HEK293T cells transfected with BK-α subunit (BK-α). Expression of WNK4 inhibited BK channels and decreased the outward K currents. Coexpression of SGK1 abolished the inhibitory effect of WNK4 on BK channels and restored the outward K currents. Expression of WNK4S1169D//1196D, in which both SGK1-phosphorylation sites (serine 1169 and 1196) were mutated to aspartate, had no effect on BK channels. Moreover, coexpression of SGK1 had no additional effect on K currents in the cells transfected with BKα+WNK4S1169D//1196D, suggesting that SGK1 reversed WNK4-induced inhibition of BK channels by stimulating WNK4 phosphorylation. Expression of WNK4 but not WNK4S1169D//1196D increased the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); an effect was abolished by coexpression of SGK1. The role of ERK and p38 MAPK in mediating the effect of WNK4 on BK channels was further suggested by the finding that the inhibition of ERK and P38 MAPK completely abolished the inhibitory effect of WNK4 on BK channels. In contrast, inhibition of MAPK failed to abolish the inhibitory effect of WNK4 on ROMK channels in both HEK cells and Xenopus oocytes. Expression of dominant negative dynaminK44A (DynK44A) or treatment of the cells with dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor, not only increased K currents but also largely abolished the inhibitory effect of WNK4 on BK channels. However, inhibition of MAPK still increased the outward K currents in the cells transfected with BKα+WNK4 and treated with dynasore. Similar results were obtained in experiments performed in the native tissue in which inhibition of ERK and p38 MAPK increased BK channel activity in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) treated with dynasore. We concluded that WNK4 inhibited BK channels by stimulating ERK and p38 MAPK and that activation of MAPK by WNK4 may inhibit BK channels partially via a mechanism other than stimulating endocytosis.

Abstract: The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is a class C G-protein-coupled receptor that is crucial for the feedback regulation of extracellular free ionised calcium homeostasis. While extracellular calcium (Ca2+o) is considered the primary physiological ligand, the CaSR is activated physiologically by a plethora of molecules including polyamines and l-amino acids. Activation of the CaSR by different ligands has the ability to stabilise unique conformations of the receptor, which may lead to preferential coupling of different G proteins; a phenomenon termed ‘ligand-biased signalling’. While mutations of the CaSR are currently not linked with any malignancies, altered CaSR expression and function are associated with cancer progression. Interestingly, the CaSR appears to act both as a tumour suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the pathophysiology involved. Reduced expression of the CaSR occurs in both parathyroid and colon cancers, leading to loss of the growth suppressing effect of high Ca2+o. On the other hand, activation of the CaSR might facilitate metastasis to bone in breast and prostate cancer. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving CaSR signalling in different tissues, aided by a systems biology approach, will be instrumental in developing novel drugs that target the CaSR or its ligands in cancer. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 12th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: In addition to their role as oncogenes, Ras GTPases are key regulators of cell function. There is a proven relationship between the signaling pathways of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF- β1) and Ras GTPases. Each of the Ras isoforms (H, N and K) exhibits specific modulatory activity on different cellular pathways. Our purpose has been to study some of the mechanisms involved in the development of renal fibrosis, assessing the individual role of N-Ras in basal and TGF-β1-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, proliferation, and migration in immortalized N-Ras deficient fibroblasts (N-ras−/−). Compared to normal counterparts, fibroblasts deficient for N-Ras exhibited higher basal activity levels of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MEK/Erk, accompanied by upregulated collagen synthesis and diminished proliferation and migration rates. We found that the absence of N-Ras did not affect TGF-β1-induced proliferation and migration, which required PI3K/Akt but not Erk1/2 activation. Similar effector pathway dependence was found for fibronectin and collagen type I expression. Our results indicate that N-Ras might contribute to renal fibrosis through the down-regulation of ECM synthesis and up-regulation proliferation and migration modulating Akt activation. N-Ras also regulates TGF-β1-induced collagen I and fibronectin expression through Erk-independent pathways.

Abstract: Proteolysis of transmembrane molecules is an irreversible post-translational modification enabling autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signaling of many cytokines. The pro-inflammatory activities of membrane bound TNFα (pro-TNFα) strongly depend on ectodomain shedding mediated by the A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease family member ADAM17. Despite the well-documented role of ADAM17 in pro-TNFα cleavage during inflammation, little is known about its regulation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase-induced phosphorylation of the ADAM17 cytoplasmic tail has been described to be required for proper activation. To address, if pro-TNFα shedding depends on cytosolic phosphorylation we analyzed ADAM17 mutants lacking the cytoplasmic domain. ADAM17 mediated shedding of pro-TNFα was induced by PMA, Anisomycin and the phosphatase inhibitors Cantharidin and Calyculin A. Deletion of the entire cytoplasmic portion of ADAM17 abolished furin-dependent proteolytic maturation and pro-TNFα cleavage. Interestingly, we could exclude that resistance to proconvertase processing is the reason for the enzymatic inactivity of ADAM17 lacking the cytoplasmic portion as furin-resistant ADAM17 mutants rescued genetic ADAM17 deficiency after mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Adding only 6 cytoplasmic amino acids completely restored ADAM17 maturation and shedding of pro-TNFα as well as of both TNF-receptors Finally, we showed that a pro-TNFα mutant lacking the cytoplasmic portion was also shed from the cell surface. We conclude that pro-TNFα cleavage by its major sheddase ADAM17 does not depend on cytosolic phosphorylation and/or interaction. These results have general implications on understanding the activation mechanism controlling the activity of ADAM17.

Abstract: The CATS protein (also known as FAM64A and RCS1) was first identified as a novel CALM (PICALM) interactor that influences the subcellular localization of the leukemogenic fusion protein CALM/AF10. CATS is highly expressed in cancer cell lines in a cell cycle dependent manner and is induced by mitogens. CATS is considered a marker for proliferation, known to control the metaphase-to-anaphase transition during the cell division. Using CATS as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified the Kinase Interacting Stathmin (KIS or UHMK1) protein as a CATS interacting partner. The interaction between CATS and KIS was confirmed by GST pull-down, co-immunopreciptation and co-localization experiments. Using kinase assay we showed that CATS is a substrate of KIS and mapped the phosphorylation site to CATS serine 131 (S131). Protein expression analysis revealed that KIS levels changed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and in the opposite direction to CATS levels. In a reporter gene assay KIS was able to enhance the transcriptional repressor activity of CATS, independent of CATS phophorylation at S131. Moreover, we showed that CATS and KIS antagonize the transactivation capacity of CALM/AF10.In summary, our results show that CATS interacts with and is a substrate for KIS, suggesting that KIS regulates CATS function.

Abstract: The retromer is a pentameric protein complex that mediates the retrograde transport of acid hydrolase receptors between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network and is conserved across all eukaryotes. Unlike other eukaryotes, the endomembrane system of Giardia trophozoite is simple and is composed only of the endoplasmic reticulum and peripheral vesicles (PVs), which may represent an ancient organellar system converging compartments such as early and late endosomes and lysosomes. Sorting and trafficking of membrane proteins and soluble hydrolases from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PVs have been described as specific and conserved but whether the giardial retromer participates in receptor recycling remains elusive. Homologs of the retromer Vacuolar Protein Sorting (Vps35p, Vps26p, and Vps29p) have been identified in this parasite. Cloning the GlVPS35 subunit and antisera production enabled the localization of this protein in the PVs as well as in the cytosol. Tagged expression of the subunits was used to demonstrate their association with membranes, and immunofluorescence confocal laser scanning revealed high degrees of colabeling between the retromer subunits and also with the endoplasmic reticulum and PV compartment markers. Protein–protein interaction data revealed interaction between the subunits of GlVPS35 and the cytosolic domain of the hydrolase receptor GlVps. Altogether our data provide original information on the molecular interactions that mediate assembly of the cargo-selective retromer subcomplex and its involvement in the recycling of the acid hydrolase receptor in this parasite.

Abstract: Tat-dependent protein transport permits the traffic of fully folded proteins across membranes in bacteria and chloroplasts. The mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. Current theories propose that a key step requires the coalescence of a substrate-binding TatC-containing complex with a TatA complex, which forms pores of varying sizes that could accommodate different substrates. We have studied the structure of the TatAd complex from Bacillus subtilis using electron microscopy to generate the first 3D model of a TatA complex from a Gram-positive bacterium. We observe that TatAd does not exhibit the remarkable heterogeneity of Escherichia coli TatA complexes but instead forms ring-shaped complexes of 7.5–9nm diameter with potential pores of 2.5–3nm diameter that are occluded at one end. Such structures are consistent with those seen for E. coli TatE complexes. Furthermore, the small diameter of the TatAd pore, and the homogeneous nature of the complexes, suggest that TatAd cannot form the translocation channel by itself. Biochemical data indicate that another B. subtilis TatA complex, TatAc, has similar properties, suggesting a common theme for TatA-type complexes from Bacillus.

Abstract: Mitochondrial β-barrel proteins fulfill central functions in the outer membrane like metabolite exchange catalyzed by the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and protein biogenesis by the central components of the preprotein translocase of the outer membrane (Tom40) or of the sorting and assembly machinery (Sam50). The mitochondrial division and morphology protein Mdm10 is another essential outer membrane protein with proposed β-barrel fold, which has so far only been found in Fungi. Mdm10 is part of the endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES), which tethers the ER to mitochondria and associates with the SAM complex. In here, we provide evidence that Mdm10 phylogenetically belongs to the VDAC/Tom40 superfamily. Contrary to Tom40 and VDAC, Mdm10 exposes long loops towards both sides of the membrane. Analyses of single loop deletion mutants of Mdm10 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveal that the loops are dispensable for Mdm10 function. Sequences similar to fungal Mdm10 can be found in species from Excavates to Fungi, but neither in Metazoa nor in plants. Strikingly, the presence of Mdm10 coincides with the appearance of the other ERMES components. Mdm10's presence in both unikonts and bikonts indicates an introduction at an early time point in eukaryotic evolution.

Abstract: Cullin-RING ubiquitin (Ub) ligases (CRLs) are responsible for ubiquitinylation of approximately 20% of all proteins degraded by the Ub proteasome system (UPS). CRLs are regulated by the COP9 signalosome (CSN) and by Cullin-associated Nedd8-dissociated protein 1 (CAND1). The CSN is responsible for removal of Nedd8 from cullins inactivating CRLs. CAND1 modulates the assembly of F-box proteins into cullin 1–RING Ub ligases (CRL1s). We show that CAND1 preferentially blocks the integration of Skp2 into CRL1s. Suppression of CAND1 expression in HeLa cells leads to an increase of the Skp2 assembly into CRL1s and to significant reduction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27. In contrary, CAND1 overexpression causes elevation of p27. The observed CAND1-dependent effects and CAND1 expression are independent of the CSN as demonstrated in CSN1 knockdown cells. Increase of p27 is a hallmark of preadipocyte differentiation to adipocytes (adipogenesis). We demonstrate that the accumulation of p27 is associated with an increase of CAND1 and a decrease of Skp2 during adipogenesis of human LiSa-2 preadipocytes. CAND1 knockdown reduces p27 and blocks adipogenesis. Due to the impact of CAND1 on Skp2 control, CAND1 could represent an important effector molecule in adipogenesis, but also in cancer development.

Abstract: HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2) binds to and phosphorylates, at Ser and Thr residues, a large number of targets involved in cell division and cell fate decision in response to different physiological or stress stimuli. Inactivation of HIPK2 has been observed in human and mouse cancers supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. Despite the biological relevance of this kinase, very little is known on how HIPK2 becomes catalytically active. Based on sequence homologies, HIPK2 has been taxonomically classified as a subfamily member of the dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases (DYRKs) and the activation-loop Y354 of HIPK2 has been found phosphorylated in different cells; however, the relevance of this Y phosphorylation is presently unknown. Here, we show that HIPK2, which is extensively phosphorylated at S/T sites throughout its functional domains, becomes catalytically active by autophosphorylation at the activation-loop Y354. In particular, we found that, in analogy to DYRKs, HIPK2-Y354 phosphorylation is an autocatalytic event and its prevention, through Y354 substitution with non-phosphorylatable amino acids or by using the kinase inhibitor purvalanol A, induces a strong reduction of the HIPK2 S/T-kinase activity on different substrates. Interestingly, at variance from DYRKs, inhibition of HIPK2-Y354 phosphorylation induces a strong out-of-target Y-kinase activity in cis and a strong cytoplasmic relocalization of the kinase. Together, these results demonstrate that the catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization of HIPK2 are regulated by autophosphorylation of its activation-loop Y354.

Abstract: Genetically encoded calcium ion (Ca2+) indicators have become very useful and widely used tools for Ca2+ imaging, not only in cellular models, but also in living organisms. However, the in vivo and in situ characterization of these indicators is tedious and time consuming, and it does not provide information regarding the suitability of an indicator for particular experimental environments. Thus, initial in vitro evaluation of these tools is typically performed to determine their properties. In this review, we examined the properties of dynamic range, affinity, selectivity, and kinetics for Ca2+ indicators. Commonly used strategies for evaluating these properties are presented. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 12th European Symposium on Calcium.

Evidence that adrenal hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase can effect microsomal P450 cytochrome steroidogenic enzymes,

Abstract: The role of adrenal hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in providing reducing equivalents to P450 cytochrome steroidogenic enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum is uncertain. Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase resides in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and co-localizes with the bidirectional enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1. Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase likely provides 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 with NADPH electrons via channeling. Intracellularly, two compartmentalized reactions generate NADPH upon oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate: cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and microsomal hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Because some endoplasmic reticulum enzymes require an electron donor (NADPH), it is conceivable that hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase serves in this capacity for these pathways. Besides 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, we examined whether hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase generates reduced pyridine nucleotide for pivotal adrenal microsomal P450 enzymes. 21-hydroxylase activity was increased with glucose-6-phosphate and, also, glucose and glucosamine-6-phosphate. The latter two substrates are only metabolized by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, indicating that requisite NADPH for 21-hydroxylase activity was not via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Moreover, dihydroepiandrostenedione, a non-competitive inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, but not hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, did not curtail activation by glucose-6-phosphate. Finally, the most compelling observation was that the microsomal glucose-6-phosphate transport inhibitor, chlorogenic acid, blunted the activation by glucose-6-phosphate of both 21-hydroxylase and 17-hydroxylase indicating that luminal hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase can supply NADPH for these enzymes. Analogous kinetic observations were found with microsomal 17-hydroxylase. These findings indicate that hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase can be a source, but not exclusively so, of NADPH for several adrenal P450 enzymes in the steroid pathway. Although the reduced pyridine nucleotides are produced intra-luminally, these compounds may also slowly transverse the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by unknown mechanisms.

Abstract: Background: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by idiopathic dilatation and systolic contractile dysfunction of the ventricle(s) leading to an impaired systolic function. The origin of DCM is heterogeneous, but genetic transmission of the disease accounts for up to 50% of the cases. Mutations in alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1), a thin filament protein involved in structural and regulatory roles in muscle cells, are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and very rarely with DCM. Methods and results: Here we present a large four-generation family in which DCM is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Six family members have a cardiomyopathy with the age of diagnosis ranging from 5months to 52years. The youngest affected was diagnosed with dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) and died at the age of five. Three additional children died young of suspected heart problems. We mapped the phenotype to chromosome 15 and subsequently identified a missense mutation in TPM1, resulting in a p.D84N amino acid substitution. In addition we sequenced 23 HCM/DCM genes using next generation sequencing. The TPM1 p.D84N was the only mutation identified. The mutation co-segregates with all clinically affected family members and significantly weakens the binding of tropomyosin to actin by 25%. Conclusions: We show that a mutation in TPM1 is associated with DCM and a lethal, early onset form of NCCM, probably as a result of diminished actin binding caused by weakened charge–charge interactions. Consequently, the screening of TPM1 in patients and families with DCM and/or (severe, early onset forms of) NCCM is warranted.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a deadly disease characterized by the clonal expansion and accumulation of hematopoietic stem cells arrested at various stages of development. Clinical research efforts are currently focusing on targeted therapies that induce apoptosis in AML cells. Herein, the effects and mechanisms of the novel flavone 3,3′-diamino-4′-methoxyflavone (DD1) on AML cell dysfunction were investigated in AML cells (monoblast U937, myelomonocyte OCI-AML3, promyelocyte NB4, myeloblast HL-60) and blood samples from patients with AML. The administration of DD1 inhibited proliferation and induced death of AML cell lines and reduced the clonogenic activity of AML, but not normal, blood cells. The flavone's apoptotic action in U937 cells was associated with recruitment of mitochondria, Bax activation, Bad dephosphorylation (at Ser136), activation of caspases -8, -9, and -3 and cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1. DD1 induced a marked decrease in (i) Thr389-phosphorylation and (ii) protein levels of the caspase-3 substrate P70 ribosomal S6 kinase (P70S6K, known for its ability to phosphorylate Bad). Caspase-dependent apoptosis and P70S6K degradation were simultaneously prevented by the caspase inhibitors. Importantly, DD1 was shown to directly inhibit the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity in U937 cells. Apoptotic activity of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was also related to Bax activation and P70S6K downregulation. Accordingly, DD1 failed to induce P70S6K cleavage, Bax stimulation and apoptosis in K562 cells resistant to bortezomib. These results indicate that DD1 has the potential to eradicate AML cells and support a critical role for Bax and P70S6K in DD1-mediated proteasome inhibition and apoptosis of leukemia cells.

Abstract: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) inhibits insulin signaling and action. Understanding the mechanisms underlying ENPP1 expression may help unravel molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance. Recent data suggest a role of ENPP1-3′untraslated region (UTR), in controlling ENPP1 expression. We sought to identify trans-acting ENPP1-3′UTR binding proteins, and investigate their role on insulin signaling. By RNA pull-down, 49 proteins bound to ENPP1-3′UTR RNA were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Among these, in silico analysis of genome wide association studies and expression profile datasets pointed to N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 gene (GALNT2) for subsequent investigations. Gene expression levels were evaluated by RT-PCR. Protein expression levels, IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation were evaluated by Western blot. Insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation was evaluated by ELISA. GALNT2 down-regulation increased while GALNT2 over-expression reduced ENPP1 expression levels. In addition, GALNT2 down-regulation reduced insulin stimulation of IR, IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation and insulin inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression, a key neoglucogenetic enzyme. Our data point to GALNT2 as a novel factor involved in the modulation of ENPP1 expression as well as insulin signaling and action in human liver HepG2 cells.

Abstract: In light induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) photoreceptor cell death is mediated by caspase independent mechanisms. The activation of LEI/L-DNase II pathway in this model, is due to cathepsin D release from lysosomes, although the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this paper we studied the involvement of calpains in lysosomal permeabilization. We investigated, for the first time, the calpain targets at lysosomal membrane level. We found that calpain 1 is responsible for lysosomal permeabilization by cleavage of the lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP 2). Moreover, LAMP 2 degradation and lysosomal permeabilization were rescued by calpain inhibition and the use of MEF−/− lamp 2 cells indicates that the cleavage of LAMP 2A is essential for this permeabilization. Finally, we found that LAMP 2 is cleaved in LIRD, suggesting that the mechanism of calpain induced lysosomal permeabilization is not exclusive of a single cell death model. Overall, these data shed new light on understanding the mechanisms of lysosomal and caspase-independent cell death and point to the original targets for development of the new therapeutic protocols.

Abstract: TGF-β1 is a prototypic profibrotic cytokine and major driver of fibrosis in the kidney and other organs. Induced in high glucose-1 (IHG-1) is a mitochondrial protein which we have recently reported to be associated with renal disease. IHG-1 amplifies responses to TGF-β1 and regulates mitochondrial biogenesis by stabilising the transcriptional co-activator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-alpha. Here we report that the mitochondrial localisation of IHG-1 is pivotal in the amplification of TGF-β1 signalling. We demonstrate that IHG-1 expression is associated with repression of the endogenous TGF-β1 inhibitor Smad7. Intriguingly, expression of a non-mitochondrial deletion mutant of IHG-1 (Δmts-IHG-1) repressed TGF-β1 fibrotic signalling in renal epithelial cells. In cells expressing Δmts-IHG-1 fibrotic responses including CCN2/connective tissue growth factor, fibronectin and jagged-1 expression were reduced following stimulation with TGF-β1. Δmts-IHG-1 modulation of TGF-β1 signalling was associated with increased Smad7 protein expression. Δmts-IHG-1 modulated TGF-β1 activity by increasing Smad7 protein expression as it failed to inhibit TGF-β1 transcriptional responses when endogenous Smad7 expression was knocked down. These data indicate that mitochondria modulate TGF-β1 signal transduction and that IHG-1 is a key player in this modulation.

Abstract: Leishmania is auxotroph for heme. Previously, we have shown that Leishmania acquire heme from the degradation of endocytosed hemoglobin via a specific receptor located in the flagellar pocket. Here, we report the cloning and expression of clathrin heavy chain from Leishmania (Ld-CHC) and provide evidences that Ld-CHC is localized in flagellar pocket and regulates Hb-endocytosis in Leishmania. Kinetic analysis of Hb trafficking in GFP-Ld-CHC overexpressed Leishmania reveals that Hb is internalized through Ld-CHC coated region and remains associated with Ld-CHC containing vesicles at early time points of internalization and subsequently starts dissociating from Hb-containing vesicles at later time points indicating that clathrin-coating and uncoating regulate Hb trafficking in Leishmania. Interestingly, overexpression of dominant negative mutant of clathrin heavy chain of Leishmania (GFP-Ld-CHC-Hub) blocks the Hb internalization and causes severe growth defect in parasite. Moreover, we have shown that chlorpromazine, a pharmacological agent, blocks Hb internalization in Leishmania by depolymerizing Ld-CHC and thereby inhibits the growth of the parasites. Taken together, our results have shown that Hb endocytosis in Leishmania is a clathrin dependent process and is essential for the survival of the parasites.

Abstract: We analyzed the kinetic and spatial patterns characterizing activation of the MAP kinases ERK 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by the three α1-adrenoceptor (α1-AR) subtypes in HEK293 cells and the contribution of two different pathways to ERK1/2 phosphorylation: protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent ERK1/2 activation and internalization-dependent ERK1/2 activation. The different pathways of phenylephrine induced ERK phosphorylation were determined by western blot, using the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8425, the receptor internalization inhibitor concanavalin A and the siRNA targeting β-arrestin 2. Receptor internalization properties were studied using CypHer5 technology and VSV-G epitope-tagged receptors. Activation of α1A- and α1B-ARs by phenylephrine elicited rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was directed to the nucleus and inhibited by Ro 31-8425. Concomitant with phenylephrine induced receptor internalization α1A-AR, but not α1B-AR, produced a maintained and PKC-independent ERK phosphorylation, which was restricted to the cytosol and inhibited by β-arrestin 2 knockdown or concanavalin A treatment. α1D-AR displayed constitutive ERK phosphorylation, which was reduced by incubation with prazosin or the selective α1D antagonist BMY7378. Following activation by phenylephrine, α1D-AR elicited rapid, transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was restricted to the cytosol and not inhibited by Ro 31-8425. Internalization of the α1D-AR subtype was not observed via CypHer5 technology. The three α1-AR subtypes present different spatio-temporal patterns of receptor internalization, and only α1A-AR stimulation translates to a late, sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation that is restricted to the cytosol and dependent on β-arrestin 2 mediated internalization.

Abstract: Faithful replication and propagation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is critical for cellular respiration. Molecular chaperones, ubiquitous proteins involved in protein folding and remodeling of protein complexes, have been implicated in mtDNA transactions. In particular, cells lacking Mdj1, an Hsp40 co-chaperone of Hsp70 in the mitochondrial matrix, do not maintain functional mtDNA. Here we report that the great majority of Mdj1 is associated with nucleoids, DNA-protein complexes that are the functional unit of mtDNA transactions. Underscoring the importance of Hsp70 chaperone activity in the maintenance of mtDNA, an Mdj1 variant having an alteration in the Hsp70-interacting J-domain does not maintain mtDNA. However, a J-domain containing fragment expressed at the level that Mdj1 is normally present is not competent to maintain mtDNA, suggesting a function of Mdj1 beyond that carried out by its J-domain. Nevertheless, loss of mtDNA function upon Mdj1 depletion is retarded when the J-domain, is overexpressed. Analysis of Mdj1 variants revealed a correlation between nucleoid association and DNA maintenance activity, suggesting that localization is functionally important. We found that Mdj1 has DNA binding activity and that variants retaining DNA-binding activity also retained nucleoid association. Together, our results are consistent with a model in which Mdj1, tethered to the nucleoid via DNA binding, thus driving a high local concentration of the Hsp70 machinery, is important for faithful DNA maintenance and propagation.

Abstract: The enzyme aromatase, encoded by the CYP19A1 gene, catalyzes the production of estrogens and inhibition of aromatase has therefore become one of the key strategies in breast cancer treatment. We have studied the effects of the vitamin D analog EB1089 on aromatase gene expression and enzyme activity in breast cancer cells. We found that EB1089 was able to decrease the gene expression and enzyme activity as well as inhibit aromatase-dependent cell growth. Furthermore, a low dose of EB1089 combined with low doses of clinically used aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane were able to effectively inhibit aromatase-dependent growth of breast cancer cells. The molecular mechanism for this effect of EB1089 on the aromatase gene expression was investigated and we found that it is mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), vitamin D receptor interacting repressor (VDIR) and Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF). ChIP and Re-ChIP assays revealed that EB1089 mediates dissociation of WSTF from the CYP19A1 promoter and thereby decreases the gene expression. Regulation of aromatase via WSTF has not been reported previously. Furthermore, gene silencing of WSTF results in decreased gene expression of CYP19A1 and aromatase activity, showing that WSTF is an interesting drug target for development of new anti-cancer drugs. In summary, we report that the vitamin D analog EB1089 is able to decrease the gene expression and enzyme activity of aromatase via a novel regulatory pathway for aromatase and suggest that EB1089 may be a new treatment option for estrogen dependent breast cancer.

Abstract: Although it is well known that insulin controls the synthesis of glycogen from non-carbohydrates by down-regulating expression of several glyconeogenic enzymes, a mechanism of short-term inhibition of glyconeogenesis remains unknown. In recent years, we have shown that in skeletal muscle, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a part of the hypothetical glyconeogenic complex located on sarcomeric Z-line. Here, we show that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 causes disruption of the FBPase–Z-line interactions and reduction of muscle glycogen content in vivo. The normal, striated pattern of muscle FBPase localization is also disturbed by insulin treatment but preserved when insulin is applied together with Akt inhibitor. We suggest that destabilization of FBPase–Z-line interaction is a universal cellular mechanism of glyconeogenesis down-regulation, allowing for preferential utilization of glucose for insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis.

Abstract: STIM1 plays a crucial role in Ca2+ homeostasis, particularly in replenishing the intracellular Ca2+ store following its depletion. In cardiomyocytes, the Ca2+ content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum must be tightly controlled to sustain contractile activity. The presence of STIM1 in cardiomyocytes suggests that it may play a role in regulating the contraction of cardiomyocytes. The aim of the present study was to determine how STIM1 participates in the regulation of cardiac contractility. Atomic force microscopy revealed that knocking down STIM1 disrupts the contractility of cardiomyocyte-derived HL-1 cells. Ca2+ imaging also revealed that knocking down STIM1 causes irregular spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in HL-1 cells. Action potential recordings further showed that knocking down STIM1 induces early and delayed afterdepolarizations. Knocking down STIM1 increased the peak amplitude and current density of T-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (T-VDCC) and shifted the activation curve toward more negative membrane potentials in HL-1 cells. Biotinylation assays revealed that knocking down STIM1 increased T-VDCC surface expression and co-immunoprecipitation assays suggested that STIM1 directly regulates T-VDCC activity. Thus, STIM1 is a negative regulator of T-VDCC activity and maintains a constant cardiac rhythm by preventing a Ca2+ overload that elicits arrhythmogenic events.

Abstract: The role of caveolin-2 (cav-2), independently of caveolin-1 (cav-1) and caveolae, has remained elusive. Our data show that cav-2 exists in the plasma membrane (PM) in cells lacking cav-1 and forms homo-oligomeric complexes. Cav-2 did not interact with cavin-1 and cavin-2 in the PM. Rab6-GTP was required for the microtubule-dependent exocytic transport of cav-2 from the Golgi to the PM independently of cav-1. The cav-2-oligomerized noncaveolar microdomain was unaffected by cholesterol depletion and protected from shearing of silica-coated PM. Activation of insulin receptor (IR) was processed in the microdomain. Actin depolymerization affected the formation and sustenance of cav-2-oligomerized noncaveolar microdomain and attenuated IR recruitment to the microdomain thereby inhibiting IR signaling activation. Cav-2 shRNA stable cells and the cells ectopically expressing an oligomerization domain truncation mutant, cav-2∆47–86 exhibited retardation of IR signaling activation via the noncaveolar microdomain. Elevation in status of cav-2 expression rendered the noncaveolar activation of IR signaling in cav-1 down-regulated or/and cholesterol-depleted cells. Our findings reveal a novel homo-oligomeric cav-2 microdomain responsible for regulating activation of IR signaling in the PM.

Abstract: Radiation induces cell cycle arrest and/or cell death in mammalian cells. In the present study, we show that Hip2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, can overcome radiation-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and trigger the entry into mitosis. Ionizing radiation increased the levels of Hip2 by preventing its degradation but not its gene transcription. The stability of Hip2 in irradiated cells was further confirmed using live cell fluorescence imaging. Flow cytometric and molecular analyses revealed that Hip2 abrogated radiation-induced G2/M arrest, promoting entry into mitosis. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Hip2 interacted with and targeted p53 for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system, resulting in the activation of cdc2-cyclin B1 kinase to promote mitotic entry. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cell cycle progression and DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint cellular responses.

Abstract: Gefitinib is an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, approved for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this report we demonstrate that gefitinib loaded PLGA nanoparticles (GNPs), in comparison to gefitinib, exhibited higher anti-cancer activity on A549 lung carcinoma cells and A431 skin carcinoma cells. Increased inhibition of pEGFR in both the cell types explains its higher anti-cancer activity. Interestingly, gefitinib resistant, H1975 (T790M EGFR mutant) lung carcinoma cells was also found to be sensitive to GNPs. Our data shows that GNPs hyperacetylate histone H3 in these cells, either directly or indirectly, which may account for the augmented cell death. GNPs were proficient in activating histone acetyltransferases (p300/CBP), which in turn induces the expression of p21 and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, inhibition of histone acetyltransferases by garcinol results in alleviation of cell death caused by GNPs. In addition to this, nuclear intrusion of GNPs results in the inhibition of NO production in nucleus, possibly through nuclear EGFR, which might be responsible for preventing cell proliferation in resistant cells. To best of our knowledge, we provide first evidence that GNPs potentiate cell death by activating p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases.

Abstract: Members of the Orai family are highly selective calcium ion channels that play an important role in store-operated calcium entry. Among the three known Orai isoforms, Orai3 has gained increased attention, notably for its emerging role in cancer. We recently demonstrated that Orai3 channels are over-expressed in breast cancer (BC) biopsies, and involved specifically in proliferation, cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells. Here, we investigate the downstream signaling mechanisms affected by Orai3 silencing, leading to the subsequent functional impact specifically seen in MCF-7 cancer cells. We report a correlation between Orai3 and c-myc expression in tumor tissues and in the MCF-7 cancer cell line by demonstrating that Orai3 down-regulation reduces both expression and activity of the proto-oncogene c-myc. This is likely mediated through the MAP Kinase pathway, as we observed decreased pERK1/2 levels and cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase after Orai3 silencing. Our results provide strong evidence that the c-myc proto-oncogene is influenced by the store-operated calcium entry channel Orai3 through the MAP kinase pathway. This connection provides new clues in the downstream mechanism linking Orai3 channels and proliferation, cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells.

Abstract: Within Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hcm1is a member of the forkhead transcription factor family with a role in chromosome organization. Our group recently described its involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis and stress resistance, and reports here that Hcm1 played a role in adaptation to respiratory metabolism when glucose or nitrogen was decreased. Regulation of Hcm1 activity occurs in at least three ways: i) protein quantity, ii) subcellular localization, and iii) transcriptional activity. Transcriptional activity was measured using a reporter gene fused to a promoter that contains a binding site for Hcm1. We also analyzed the levels of several genes whose expression is known to be regulated by Hcm1 levels and the role of the main kinases known to respond to nutrients. Lack of sucrose-nonfermenting (Snf1) kinase increases cytoplasmic localization of Hcm1, whereas Δtor1 cells showed a mild increase in nuclear Hcm1. In vitro experiments showed that Snf1 clearly phosphorylates Hcm1 while Sch9 exerts a milder phosphorylation. Although in vitroTor1 does not directly phosphorylate Hcm1, in vivo rapamycin treatment increases nuclear Hcm1. We conclude that Hcm1 participates in the adaptation of cells from fermentation to respiratory metabolism during nutrient scarcity. According to our hypothesis, when nutrient levels decrease, Snf1 phosphorylates Hcm1. This results in a shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and increased transcriptional activity of genes involved in respiration, use of alternative energy sources, NAD synthesis and oxidative stress resistance.

Abstract: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and various inflammatory diseases. CD69 is a marker of early activation of lymphocytes. We investigated the effects of HTLV-1 infection on the expression of CD69. The CD69 gene was upregulated in all viral protein Tax-expressing HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines, except MT-2 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with ATL compared with uninfected T-cell line, Tax-negative ATL-derived T-cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the enhanced expression of CD69 in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines and in ATL cells in lymph nodes and skin lesions, and its absence in MT-2 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CD69 expression was induced following infection of human T-cell line with HTLV-1, and specifically by Tax. Tax transcriptionally activated CD69 gene through both nuclear factor-κB and cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate response element-binding protein signaling pathways. Detailed analysis of the CD69 promoter indicated that the Tax-induced expression of CD69 was regulated by multiple cis-acting elements and by the interplay of transcription factors of the nuclear factor-κB, early growth response and cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate response element-binding protein families. The lack of CD69 expression in MT-2 is due to epigenetic mechanism involving deacetylation, but not methylation. We conclude that CD69 is a Tax-regulated gene, and its regulation by Tax may play a role in cellular activation and HTLV-1-induced disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Unlike the synthesis of other membrane lipids, sphingolipid synthesis is compartmentalized between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The initial steps of sphingolipid synthesis, from the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase through to dihydroceramide desaturase, take place in the endoplasmic reticulum, but the further metabolism of ceramide to sphingomyelin and complex glycosphingolipids takes place mostly in the Golgi apparatus. Studies over the last decade or so have revealed unexpected levels of complexity in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, mainly due to either the promiscuity of some enzymes towards their substrates, or the tight selectivity of others towards specific substrates. We now discuss two enzymes in this pathway, namely serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and ceramide synthase (CerS), and one lipid transport protein, CERT. For SPT and CERT, significant structural information is available, and for CerS, significant information has recently been obtained that sheds light of the roles of the specific ceramide species that are produced by each of the CerS. We consider the mechanisms by which specificity is generated and speculate on the reasons that sphingolipid biosynthesis is so complex. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Functional and structural diversity of endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: Immunophilins are FK506-binding proteins that have been involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, either by modulating Ca2+ channels located in the plasma membrane or in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RE). We have investigated whether immunophilins would participate in the regulation of stored-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in human platelets and MEG 01. Both cell types were loaded with fura-2 for determining cytosolic calcium concentration changes ([Ca2+]c), or stimulated and fixed to evaluate the protein interaction profile by performing immunoprecipitation and western blotting. We have found that incubation of platelets with FK506 increases Ca2+ mobilization. Thapsigargin (TG)-evoked, Thr-evoked SOCE and TG-evoked Mn2+ entry resulted in significant reduction by treatment of platelets with immunophilin antagonists. We confirmed by immunoprecipitation that immunophilins interact with transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) and Orai1 in human platelets. FK506 and rapamycin reduced the association between TRPC1 and Orai1 with FK506 binding protein (52) (FKBP52) in human platelets, and between TRPC1 and the type II IP3R, which association is known to be crucial for the maintenance of SOCE in human platelets. FKBP52 role in SOCE activation was confirmed by silencing FKBP52 using SiRNA FKBP52 in MEG 01 as demonstrated by single cell configuration imaging technique. TRPC1 silencing and depletion of cell of TRPC1 and FKBP52 simultaneously, impair activation of SOCE evoked by TG in MEG 01. Finally, in MEG 01 incubated with FK506 we observed a reduction in TRPC1/FKBP52 coupling, and similarly, FKBP52 silencing reduced the association between IP3R type II and TRPC1 during SOCE. All together, these results demonstrate that immunophilins participate in the regulation of SOCE in human platelets.

Abstract: 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the most common oxidative base lesions in normal tissues induced by a variety of endogenous and exogenous agents. Hydantoins are products of 8-oxoG oxidation and as 8-oxoG, they have been shown to be mutagenic lesions. Oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in the etiology of various age-associated pathologies, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, and several neurodegenerative diseases. The mammalian endonuclease VIII-like 3 (Neil3) is one of the four DNA glycosylases found to recognize and remove hydantoins in the first step of base excision repair (BER) pathway. We have generated mice lacking Neil3 and by using total cell extracts we demonstrate that Neil3 is the main DNA glycosylase that incises hydantoins in single stranded DNA in tissues. Using the neurosphere culture system as a model to study neural stem/progenitor (NSPC) cells we found that lack of Neil3 impaired self renewal but did not affect differentiation capacity. Proliferation was also reduced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Neil3−/− embryos and these cells were sensitive to both the oxidative toxicant paraquat and interstrand cross-link (ICL)-inducing agent cisplatin. Our data support the involvement of Neil3 in removal of replication blocks in proliferating cells.

Abstract: The transport of proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus requires interactions between soluble transport receptors (karyopherins) and phenylalanine–glycine (FG) repeat domains on nuclear pore complex proteins (nucleoporins). However, the role of specific FG repeat-containing nucleoporins in nuclear protein export has not been carefully investigated. We have developed a novel kinetic assay to investigate the relative export kinetics mediated by the karyopherin Msn5/Kap142 in yeast containing specific FG-Nup mutations. Using the Msn5 substrate Crz1 as a marker for Msn5-mediated protein export, we observe that deletions of NUP100 or NUP2 result in decreased rates of Crz1 export, while nup60Δ and nup42Δ mutants do not vary significantly from wild type. The decreased Msn5 export rate in nup100Δ was confirmed using Mig1-GFP as a transport substrate. A nup100ΔGLFG mutant shows defects in nuclear export kinetics similar to a nup100Δ deletion. Removal of FG-repeats from Nsp1 also decreases export kinetics, while a loss of Nup1 FXFGs does not. To confirm that our export data reflected functional differences in protein localization, we performed Crz1 transcription activation assays using a CDRE::LacZ reporter gene that is upregulated upon increased transcription activation by Crz1 in vivo. We observe that expression from this reporter increases in nup100ΔGLFG and nsp1ΔFGΔFXFG strains that exhibit decreased Crz1 export kinetics but resembles wild-type levels in nup1ΔFXFG strains that do not exhibit export defects. These data provide evidence that the export of Msn5 is likely mediated by a specific subset of FG-Nups and that the GLFG repeat domain of Nup100 is important for Msn5-mediated nuclear protein export.

Abstract: In Jurkat T cell clone (JT/Neo), G2/M arrest, apoptotic sub-G1 peak, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) loss, and TUNEL-positive DNA fragmentation were induced following exposure to 17α-estradiol (17α-E2), whereas none of these events (except for G2/M arrest) were induced in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (JT/Bcl-2). Under these conditions, phosphorylation at Thr161 and dephosphorylation at Tyr15 of Cdk1, upregulation of cyclin B1 level, histone H1 phosphorylation, Cdc25C phosphorylation at Thr-48, Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Thr-56 and Ser-70, Mcl-1 phosphorylation, and Bim phosphorylation were detected in the presence of Bcl-2 overexpression. However, the 17α-E2-induced upregulation of Bak levels, activation of Bak, activation of caspase-3, and PARP degradation were abrogated by Bcl-2 overexpression. In the presence of the G1/S blocking agent hydroxyurea, 17α-E2 failed to induce G2/M arrest and all apoptotic events including Cdk1 activation and phosphorylation of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bim. The 17α-E2-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins and mitochondrial apoptotic events were suppressed by a Cdk1 inhibitor but not by aurora A and aurora B kinase inhibitors. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis showed that an aberrant bipolar microtubule array, incomplete chromosome congression at the metaphase plate, and prometaphase arrest, which was reversible, were the underlying factors for 17α-E2-induced mitotic arrest. The in vitro microtubule polymerization assay showed that 17α-E2 could directly inhibit microtubule formation. These results show that the apoptogenic activity of 17α-E2 was due to the impaired mitotic spindle assembly causing prometaphase arrest and prolonged Cdk1 activation, the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bim, and the activation of Bak and mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade.

Abstract: Lipidated peptides (pepducins) can activate certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) through a unique allosteric modulation mechanism involving cytosolic receptor domains. Pepducins with the amino acid sequence of the third intracellular loop of the neutrophil formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) as a common denominator were N-terminally conjugated with palmitic acid. F2Pal16, containing the 16 amino acids present in the third intracellular loop of FPR2, induced superoxide production in human neutrophils and the activity was sensitive to FPR2 antagonists. Cells over-expressing FPR2 were similarly responsive and responded with a transient increase in cytosolic calcium. No such effects were observed with the corresponding FPR1 pepducin. The peptide alone, lacking palmitic acid, did not activate neutrophils. A ten amino acid long pepducin F2Pal10, that was a more potent neutrophil activator than F2Pal16, was used for amino acid substitution studies. The sequences of FPR1 and FPR2 in the third intracellular loop differ by only two amino acids, and a pepducin with the FPR2-specific K231 replaced by the FPR1-specific Q231 lost all activity. The active F2Pal10 pepducin also triggered a response in cells expressing a mutated FPR2 with the third intracellular loop identical to that of FPR1. The data presented suggest that the same signaling pathways are activated when the signaling cascade is initiated by a classical receptor agonist (outside-in signaling) and when signaling starts on the cytosolic side of the membrane by a pepducin (inside-in signaling). A fundamental difference is also disclosed between the two neutrophil FPRs regarding their sensitivities to third intracellular loop pepducins.

CCN4-induced VCAM-1 expression was attenuated by αvβ5 or α6β1 integrin antibody, Syk inhibitor, PKCδ inhibitor (rottlerin), JNK inhibitor (SP600125), and AP-1 inhibitors (curcumin and tanshinone). Stimulation of cells with CCN4 increased Syk, PKCδ, and JNK activation. Treatment of OASFs with CCN4 also increased c-Jun phosphorylation, AP-1-luciferase activity, and c-Jun binding to the AP-1 element in the VCAM-1 promoter. Moreover, up-regulation of VCAM-1 increased the adhesion of monocytes to OASF monolayers, and this adhesion was attenuated by transfection with a VCAM-1 siRNA. Our results suggest that CCN4 increases VCAM-1 expression in human OASFs via the Syk, PKCδ, JNK, c-Jun, and AP-1 signaling pathways. The CCN4-induced VCAM-1 expression promoted monocyte adhesion to human OASFs.

Abstract: Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a widely expressed and multifunctional protein that modulates cell death/survival processes. We have previously shown that TG2 binds to hypoxia inducible factor 1β (HIF1β) and decreases the upregulation of HIF responsive genes; however, the relationship between these observations was not investigated. In this study, we investigated whether endogenous TG2 is sufficient to suppress HIF activity and whether the interaction between TG2 and HIF1β is required for this suppression. shRNA-mediated silencing of TG2 significantly enhanced HIF activation in response to hypoxia. In addition, nuclear localization of TG2 is required for its suppressive effect on HIF activity, with TG2 being recruited to HIF responsive promoters in hypoxic conditions. These observations suggest that TG2 directly regulates hypoxic transcriptional machinery; however, its interaction with HIF1β was not required for this regulation. We also examined whether TG2's effect on cell death/survival processes in ischemia is due to its effects on HIF signaling. Our results indicate that TG2 mediated HIF suppression can be separated from TG2's effect on cell survival in hypoxic/hypoglycemic conditions. Lastly, here we show that nuclear TG2 in the closed conformation and non-nuclear TG2 in the open conformation have opposing effects on hypoxic/hypoglycemic cell death, which could explain previous controversial results. Overall, our results further clarify the role of TG2 in mediating the cellular response to ischemia and suggest that manipulating the conformation of TG2 might be of pharmacological interest as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemia-related pathologies.

Abstract: Terminally-differentiated cells cease to proliferate and acquire specific sets of expressed genes and functions distinguishing them from less differentiated and cancer cells. Mature granulocytes show lobular structure of cell nuclei with highly condensed chromatin in which HP1 proteins are replaced by MNEI. These structural features of chromatin correspond to low level of gene expression and the loss of some important functions as DNA damage repair, shown in this work and, on the other hand, acquisition of a new specific function consisting in the release of chromatin extracellular traps in response to infection by pathogenic microbes. Granulocytic differentiation is incomplete in myeloid leukemia and is manifested by persistence of lower levels of HP1γ and HP1β isoforms. This immaturity is accompanied by acquisition of DDR capacity allowing to these incompletely differentiated multi-lobed neutrophils of AML patients to respond to induction of DSB by γ-irradiation. Immature granulocytes persist frequently in blood of treated AML patients in remission. These granulocytes contrary to mature ones do not release chromatin for NETs after activation with phorbol myristate-12 acetate-13 and do not exert the neutrophil function in immune defence. We suggest therefore the detection of HP1 expression in granulocytes of AML patients as a very sensitive indicator of their maturation and functionality after the treatment. Our results show that the changes in chromatin structure underlie a major transition in functioning of the genome in immature granulocytes. They show further that leukemia stem cells can differentiate ex vivo to mature granulocytes despite carrying the translocation BCR/ABL.

Abstract: Stat3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3) is activated by a number of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. We recently demonstrated that engagement of E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent, cell to cell adhesion molecule which is often required for cells to remain tightly associated within the epithelium, also activates Stat3. We now examined the effect of two other classical cadherins, cadherin-11 and N-cadherin, whose expression often correlates with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition occurring in metastasis of carcinoma cells, upon Stat3 phosphorylation and activity. Our results indicate that engagement of these two cadherins also, can trigger a dramatic surge in Stat3 activity. This activation occurs through upregulation of members of the IL6 family of cytokines, and it is necessary for cell survival, proliferation and migration. Interestingly, our results also demonstrate for the first time that, in sharp contrast to Stat3, the activity of Erk (Extracellular Signal Regulated kinase) was unaffected by cadherin-11 engagement. Further examination indicated that, although IL6 was able to activate Erk in sparsely growing cells, IL6 could not induce an increase in Erk activity levels in densely growing cultures. Most importantly, cadherin-11 knock-down did allow Erk activation by IL6 at high densities, indicating that it is indeed cadherin engagement that prevents Erk activation by IL6. The fact that the three classical cadherins tested so far, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and cadherin11, which are present in essentially all tissues, actually activate Stat3 regardless of their role in metastasis, argues for Stat3 as a central survival, rather than invasion factor.

Abstract: The differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes into macrophages can be reproduced ex vivo by culturing the cells in the presence of colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Using microarray profiling to explore the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), we identified a dramatic decrease in the expression of the hematopoietic specific miR-142-3p. Up- and down-regulation of this miRNA in primary human monocytes altered CSF1-induced differentiation of monocytes, as demonstrated by changes in the expression of the cell surface markers CD16 and CD163. One of the genes whose expression is repressed by miR-142-3p encodes the transcription factor Early Growth Response 2 (Egr2). In turn, Egr2 associated with its co-repressor NGFI-A (Nerve Growth Factor-Induced gene-A) binding protein 2 (NAB2) binds to the pre-miR-142-3p promoter to negatively regulate its expression. Interestingly, the expression of miR-142-3p is abnormally low in monocytes from patients with the most proliferative forms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and miR-142-3p re-expression in CMML dysplastic monocytes can improve their differentiation potential. Altogether, miR-142-3p which functions in a molecular circuitry with Egr2 is an actor of CSF1-induced differentiation of human monocytes whose expression could be altered in CMML.

Dexamethasone increases αvβ3 integrin expression and affinity through a calcineurin/NFAT pathway,

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine how dexamethasone (DEX) regulates the expression and activity of αvβ3 integrin. FACS analysis showed that DEX treatment induced expression of an activated αvβ3 integrin. Its expression remained high as long as DEX was present and continued following DEX removal. FACS analysis showed that the upregulation of αvβ3 integrin was the result of an increase in the expression of the β3 integrin subunit. By real time qPCR, DEX treatment induced a 6.2-fold increase (p<0.04) in β3 integrin mRNA by day 2 compared to control and remained elevated for 6days of treatment and then an additional 10days once the DEX was removed. The increase in β3 integrin mRNA levels required only 1day of DEX treatment to increase levels for 4days in the absence of DEX. In contrast, DEX did not alter β1 integrin mRNA or protein levels. The DEX-induced upregulation of β3 integrin mRNA was partly due to an increase in its half-life to 60.7h from 22.5h in control cultures (p<0.05) and could be inhibited by RU486 and cycloheximide, suggesting that DEX-induced de novo protein synthesis of an activation factor was needed. The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 inhibited the DEX induced increase in β3 integrin mRNA. In summary, the DEX-induced increase in β3 integrin is a secondary glucocorticoid response that results in prolonged expression of αvβ3 integrin and the upregulation of the β3 integrin subunit through the calcineurin/NFAT pathway.

4F2hc-silencing impairs tumorigenicity of HeLa cells via modulation of galectin-3 and β-catenin signaling, and MMP-2 expression,

Abstract: 4F2hc is a type-II glycoprotein whose covalent-bound association with one of several described light chains yields a heterodimer mainly involved in large neutral amino acid transport. Likewise, it is well known that the heavy chain interacts with β-integrins mediating integrin-dependent events such as survival, proliferation, migration and even transformation. 4F2hc is a ubiquitous protein whose overexpression has been related to tumor development and progression. Stable silencing of 4F2hc in HeLa cells using an artificial miRNA impairs in vivo tumorigenicity and leads to an ineffective proliferation response to mitogens. 4F2hc colocalizes with β1-integrins and CD147, but this interaction does not occur in lipid rafts in HeLa cells. Moreover, silenced cells present defects in integrin- (FAK, Akt and ERK1/2) and hypoxia-dependent signaling, and reduced expression/activity of MMP-2. These alterations seem to be dependent on the inappropriate formation of CD147/4F2hc/β1-integrin heterocomplexes on the cell surface, arising when CD147 cannot interact with 4F2hc. Although extracellular galectin-3 accumulates due to the decrease in MMP-2 activity, galectin-3 signaling events are blocked due to an impaired interaction with 4F2hc, inducing an increased degradation of β-catenin. Furthermore, cell motility is compromised after protein silencing, suggesting that 4F2hc is related to tumor invasion by facilitating cell motility. Therefore, here we propose a molecular mechanism by which 4F2hc participates in tumor progression, favoring first steps of epithelial–mesenchymal transition by inhibition of β-catenin proteasomal degradation through Akt/GSK-3β signaling and enabling cell motility.

Abstract: Natural plant-derived products are commonly applied to treat a broad range of human diseases, including cancer as well as chronic and acute airway inflammation. In this regard, the monoterpene oxide 1,8-cineol, the active ingredient of the clinically approved drug Soledum®, is well-established for the therapy of airway diseases, such as chronic sinusitis and bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial asthma. Although clinical trials underline the beneficial effects of 1,8-cineol in treating inflammatory diseases, the molecular mode of action still remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a 1,8-cineol-depending reduction of NF-κB-activity in human cell lines U373 and HeLa upon stimulation using lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Immunocytochemistry further revealed a reduced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, while qPCR and western blot analyses showed strongly attenuated expression of NF-κB target genes. Treatment with 1,8-cineol further led to increased protein levels of IκBα in an IKK-independent matter, while FRET-analyses showed restoring of LPS-associated loss of interaction between NF-κB p65 and IκBα. We likewise observed reduced amounts of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 protein in U373 cells after exposure to 1,8-cineol. In addition, 1,8-cineol led to decreased amount of nuclear NF-κB p65 and reduction of its target gene IκBα at protein level in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our findings suggest a novel mode of action of 1,8-cineol through inhibition of nuclear NF-κB p65 translocation via IκBα resulting in decreased levels of proinflammatory NF-κB target genes and may therefore broaden the field of clinical application of this natural drug for treating inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: During multi-cellular tumor spheroid growth, oxygen and nutrient gradients develop inducing specific genetic and metabolic changes in the proliferative and quiescent cellular layers. An integral analysis of proteomics, metabolomics, kinetomics and fluxomics revealed that both proliferative- (PRL) and quiescent-enriched (QS) cellular layers of mature breast tumor MCF-7 multi-cellular spheroids maintained similar glycolytic rates (3–5nmol/min/106 cells), correlating with similar GLUT1, GLUT3, PFK-1, and HKII contents, and HK and LDH activities. Enhanced glycolytic fluxes in both cell layer fractions also correlated with higher HIF-1α content, compared to MCF-7 monolayer cultures. On the contrary, the contents of the mitochondrial proteins GA-K, ND1, COXIV, PDH-E1α, 2-OGDH, SDH and F1-ATP synthase (20 times) and the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) flux (2-times) were higher in PRL vs. QS. Enhanced mitochondrial metabolism in the PRL layers correlated with an increase in the oncogenes h-Ras and c-Myc, and transcription factors p32 and PGC-1α, which are involved in the OxPhos activation. On the other hand, the lower mitochondrial function in QS was associated with an increase in Beclin, LC3B, Bnip3 and LAMP protein levels, indicating active mitophagy and lysosome biosynthesis processes. Although a substantial increase in glycolysis was developed, OxPhos was the predominant ATP supplier in both QS and PRL layers. Therefore, targeted anti-mitochondrial therapy by using oligomycin (IC50=11nM), Casiopeina II-gly (IC50=40nM) or Mitoves (IC50=7nM) was effective to arrest MCF-7 spheroid growth without apparent effect on normal epithelial breast tissue at similar doses; canonical anti-neoplastic drugs such as cisplatin and tamoxifen were significantly less potent.

Abstract: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in a number of cellular processes. In Dictyostelium, Cdk5 localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm, interacts with puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase A (PsaA), and regulates endocytosis, secretion, growth, and multicellular development. Here we show that Cdk5 is a calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein (CaMBP) in Dictyostelium. Cdk5, PsaA, and CaM were all present in isolated nuclei and Cdk5 and PsaA co-immunoprecipitated with nuclear CaM. Although nuclear CaMBPs have previously been identified in Dictyostelium, the detection of CaM in purified nuclear fractions had not previously been shown. Putative CaM-binding domains (CaMBDs) were identified in Cdk5 and PsaA. Deletion of one of the two putative CaMBDs in Cdk5 (132LLINRKGELKLADFGLARAFGIP154) prevented CaM-binding indicating that this region encompasses a functional CaMBD. This deletion also increased the nuclear distribution of Cdk5 suggesting that CaM regulates the nucleocytoplasmic transport of Cdk5. A direct binding between CaM and PsaA could not be determined since deletion of the one putative CaMBD in PsaA prevented the nuclear localization of the deletion protein. Together, this study provides the first direct evidence for nuclear CaM in Dictyostelium and the first evidence in any system for Cdk5 being a CaMBP.

Abstract: In most eukaryotic cells, mitochondria have various essential roles for proper cell function, such as energy production, and in mammals mitochondria also act as a platform for antiviral innate immunity. Mitochondrial-mediated antiviral immunity depends on the activation of the cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) signaling pathway, and on the participation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), which is localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane. After RNA virus infection, RLRs translocate to the mitochondrial surface to interact with MAVS, and the adaptor protein undergoes a conformational change that is essential for downstream signaling, although its structural features are poorly understood. Here we examined the MAVS-regulatory mechanism on the mitochondrial outer membrane using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in live cells. Using a combination of BRET and functional analysis, we found that the activated MAVS conformation is a highly ordered oligomer, at least more than three molecules per complex unit on the membrane. Hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease and mitofusin 2, which are known MAVS inhibitors, interfere with MAVS homotypic oligomerization in a distinct manner, each differentially altering the active conformation of MAVS. Our results reveal structural features underlying the precise regulation of MAVS signaling on the mitochondrial outer membrane, and may provide insight into other signaling systems involving organelles.

Abstract: The oestradiol plays an important role in normal brain development and exerts neuroprotective actions. Oestradiol is mainly produced in the ovary and in addition is locally synthesised in the brain. Most of the oestradiol functions have been associated with its capacity to directly bind and dimerize “classical oestrogen receptors” (ERs), alpha and beta. The ERs' actions have been classified as “genomic” and “non-genomic” depending on whether protein synthesis occurs through ER driven transcription or not. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that oestrogen may also act as a more general “trophic factor”. Hence, we have studied the capacity of oestradiol to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway and its implication in axonal growth and neuronal morphogenesis. Our data show that when oestrogen receptors are blocked the axonal and dendritic lengths are reduced in mouse primary neurons. We found that Akt/Rheb/mTORC1 responds to ER activation in neurons and that some elements of this pathway are able to restore a normal neuronal morphology even in the presence of oestrogen receptor antagonist. All these data demonstrate a new mechanism regulated by oestradiol, at least in neuronal morphogenesis.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH oxidases play critical roles in plant environmental responses. Arabidopsis thaliana NADPH oxidase AtRbohF-mediated ROS-production is involved in abiotic stress responses. Because overproduction of ROS is highly toxic to cells, the activity of AtRbohF needs to be tightly regulated in response to diverse stimuli. The ROS-producing activity of AtRbohF is activated by Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation, but other regulatory factors for AtRbohF are mostly unknown. In this study, we screened for proteins that interact with the N-terminal cytosolic region of AtRbohF by a yeast two-hybrid screen, and isolated AtSRC2, an A. thaliana homolog of SRC2 (soybean gene regulated by cold-2). A co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that AtSRC2 interacts with the N-terminal region of AtRbohF in plant cells. Intracellular localization of GFP-tagged AtSRC2 was partially overlapped with that of GFP-tagged AtRbohF at the cell periphery. Co-expression of AtSRC2 enhanced the Ca2+-dependent ROS-producing activity of AtRbohF in HEK293T cells, but did not affect its phosphorylation-dependent activation. Low-temperature treatment induced expression of the AtSRC2 gene in Arabidopsis roots in proportion to levels of ROS production that was partially dependent on AtRbohF. Our findings suggest that AtSRC2 is a novel activator of Ca2+-dependent AtRbohF-mediated ROS production and may play a role in cold responses.

Abstract: Physiological electric fields are involved in many biological processes and known to elicit their effects during long exposures ranging from a few hours to days. Following exposure to electric fields of physiological amplitude, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was demonstrated to be redistributed and upregulated with further intracellular signaling such as the MAPK signaling cascade. In our study we demonstrated EGFR activation and signaling induced by short train of pulsed low electric field (LEF) (10V/cm, pulse-width 180μs, 500Hz, 2min) in serum-free medium, following 24-hour starvation, and in the absence of exogenous EGF ligand, suggesting a ligand-independent pathway for EGFR activation. This ligandless activation was further confirmed by using neutralizing antibodies (LA1) that block the EGFR ligand-binding site. EGFR activation was found to be EGFR kinase dependent, yet with no dimerization following exposure to LEF. ERK activation was found to be mainly a result of EGFR downstream signaling though it partially occurred via EGFR-independent way. We demonstrate that reactive oxygen species and especially decrease in pH generated during exposure to LEF are involved in EGFR ligandless activation. We propose a possible mechanism for the LEF-induced EGFR ligand-independent activation and show activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases following exposure to LEF.

Abstract: CD16b (FcγRIIIb) is exclusively expressed by human neutrophils and binds IgG in immune complexes. Cell surface CD16b undergoes efficient ectodomain shedding upon neutrophil activation and apoptosis. Indeed, soluble CD16b is present at high levels in the plasma of healthy individuals, which appears to be maintained by the daily turnover of apoptotic neutrophils. At this time, the principal protease responsible for CD16b shedding is not known. We show that CD16b plasma levels were significantly decreased in patients administered a selective inhibitor targeting the metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17. Additional analysis with inhibitors selective for ADAM10 or ADAM17 revealed that only inhibition of ADAM17 significantly blocked the cleavage of CD16b following neutrophil activation and apoptosis. CD16b shedding by ADAM17 was further demonstrated using a unique ADAM17 function-blocking mAb and a cell-based ADAM17 reconstitution assay. Unlike human CD16, however, mouse CD16 did not undergo efficient ectodomain shedding upon neutrophil stimulation or apoptosis, indicating that this mechanism cannot be modeled in normal mice. Taken together, our findings are the first to directly demonstrate that ADAM17 cleaves CD16 in human leukocytes.
