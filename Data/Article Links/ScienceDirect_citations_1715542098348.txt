Abstract: Summary
Nuclear mRNA export is highly regulated to ensure accurate cellular gene expression. Viral inhibition of cellular mRNA export can enhance viral access to the cellular translation machinery and prevent anti-viral protein production but is generally thought to be nonselective. We report that ORF10 of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a nuclear DNA virus, inhibits mRNA export in a transcript-selective manner to control cellular gene expression. Nuclear export inhibition by ORF10 requires an interaction with an RNA export factor, Rae1. Genome-wide analysis reveals a subset of cellular mRNAs whose nuclear export is blocked by ORF10 with the 3′ UTRs of ORF10-targeted transcripts conferring sensitivity to export inhibition. The ORF10-Rae1 interaction is important for the virus to express viral genes and produce infectious virions. These results suggest that a nuclear DNA virus can selectively interfere with RNA export to restrict host gene expression for optimal replication.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling through the IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) is required to prevent oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in mice and humans. However, the IL-17-responsive cell type(s) that mediate protection are unknown. Using radiation chimeras, we were able to rule out a requirement for IL-17RA in the hematopoietic compartment. We saw remarkable concordance of IL-17-controlled gene expression in C. albicans-infected human oral epithelial cells (OECs) and in tongue tissue from mice with OPC. To interrogate the role of the IL-17R in OECs, we generated mice with conditional deletion of IL-17RA in superficial oral and esophageal epithelial cells (Il17raΔK13). Following oral Candida infection, Il17raΔK13 mice exhibited fungal loads and weight loss indistinguishable from Il17ra−/− mice. Susceptibility in Il17raΔK13 mice correlated with expression of the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 3 (BD3, Defb3). Consistently, Defb3−/− mice were susceptible to OPC. Thus, OECs dominantly control IL-17R-dependent responses to OPC through regulation of BD3 expression.

Abstract: Pre-transplant myeloablation is associated with marrow adipogenesis, resulting in delayed engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This is strongly undesirable, especially when the donor HSCs are fewer in numbers or have compromised functionality. The molecular mechanisms behind irradiation-induced marrow adipogenesis have not been extensively investigated. Here we show that bone marrow (BM) cells, especially T-cells and stromal cells, express and secrete copious amounts of BMP4 in response to irradiation, which causes the bone marrow stromal cells to commit to adipocyte lineage, thereby contributing to an increase in bone marrow adipogenesis. We further demonstrate that Simvastatin inhibits the BMP4-mediated adipogenic commitment of marrow stromal cells by inhibiting Ppar-γ expression. Importantly, Simvastatin does not prevent BMP4 secretion by the BM cells, and thus does not interfere with its salutary role in post-transplant hematopoietic regeneration. Our data identify previously unknown mechanisms operative in marrow adipogenesis post-myeloablation. They also reveal the molecular mechanisms behind the advantage of using Simvastatin as a niche-targeting agent to improve HSC engraftment.

Abstract: Smoothened belongs to the class of atypical G protein-coupled receptors and serves as the transducing molecule in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Hh proteins comprise a family of secreted, cholesterol-modified ligands, which act both as morphogens and as signaling molecules. Binding of Hh proteins to their direct receptor, the transmembrane protein Patched-1, relieves Smoothened from tonal inhibition by Patched-1 and causes the translocation of Smoothened into the cilium. Here, the Hh signaling cascade is initiated and results in transcriptional activation of Hh target genes such as gli1 or patched-1. This induces a plethora of physiological outcomes including normal embryonic development, but also cancer, which is the reason why scientists aim to develop strategies to manipulate as well as monitor Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling. The zebrafish has emerged as a valuable tool for the assessment of Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling. In this chapter we thus describe how Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling can be monitored and also quantified using zebrafish embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Our mechanistic understanding of Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway function in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) owes much to their role in experimentally induced DNA crosslink lesion repair. In bone marrow HSPCs, unresolved stress confers p53-dependent apoptosis and progressive cell attrition. The role of FA proteins during hematopoietic development, in the face of physiological replicative demand, remains elusive. Here, we reveal a fetal HSPC pool in Fancd2−/− mice with compromised clonogenicity and repopulation. Without experimental manipulation, fetal Fancd2−/− HSPCs spontaneously accumulate DNA strand breaks and RAD51 foci, associated with a broad transcriptional DNA-damage response, and constitutive activation of ATM as well as p38 stress kinase. Remarkably, the unresolved stress during rapid HSPC pool expansion does not trigger p53 activation and apoptosis; rather, it constrains proliferation. Collectively our studies point to a role for the FA pathway during hematopoietic development and provide a new model for studying the physiological function of FA proteins.

Abstract: The collecting duct in the mammalian kidney consists of principal cells (PCs) and intercalated cells (ICs), which regulate electrolyte/fluid and acid/base balance, respectively. The epigenetic regulators of PC and IC differentiation remain obscure. We previously used Aqp2 and V-ATPase B1B2 to label PCs and ICs, respectively. We found that mice with histone H3 K79 methyltransferase Dot1l disrupted in Aqp2-expressing cells (Dot1lAC) vs. Dot1lf/f possessed ~20% more ICs coupled with a similar decrease in PCs. Here, we performed multiple double immunofluorescence staining using various PC and IC markers and confirmed that this finding. Both α-IC and β-IC populations were significantly expanded in Dot1lAC vs. Dot1lf/f. These changes are associated with significantly upregulated V-ATPase B1 and B2, but not Aqp2, AE1, and Pendrin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay unveiled a significant reduction of Dot1l and H3K79 di-methylation bound at the Atp6v1b1 5′ flanking region. Overexpression of Dot1a significantly downregulated a stably-transfected luciferase reporter driven by the Atp6v1b1 promoter in IMCD3 cells. This downregulation was impaired, but not completely abolished when a methyltransferase-dead mutant was overexpressed. Taken together, our data suggest that Dot1l is a new epigenetic regulator of PC and IC differentiation and Atp6v1b1 is a new transcriptional target of Dot1l.

Abstract: Summary
Modeling of neurological diseases using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from the somatic cells of patients has provided a means of elucidating pathogenic mechanisms and performing drug screening. T cells are an ideal source of patient-specific iPSCs because they can be easily obtained from samples. Recent studies indicated that iPSCs retain an epigenetic memory relating to their cell of origin that restricts their differentiation potential. The classical method of differentiation via embryoid body formation was not suitable for T cell-derived iPSCs (TiPSCs). We developed a neurosphere-based robust differentiation protocol, which enabled TiPSCs to differentiate into functional neurons, despite differences in global gene expression between TiPSCs and adult human dermal fibroblast-derived iPSCs. Furthermore, neurons derived from TiPSCs generated from a juvenile patient with Parkinson's disease exhibited several Parkinson's disease phenotypes. Therefore, we conclude that TiPSCs are a useful tool for modeling neurological diseases.

Abstract: Obesity and diabetes-related kidney diseases associate with renal failure and cardiovascular morbidity, and represent a major health issue worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to their development remain poorly understood. We observed increased expression of transcription factor FoxC2 in the podocytes of obese Zucker rats that are insulin resistant and albuminuric. We also found that depletion of adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived hormone whose secretion is decreased in obesity, upregulated FOXC2 in differentiated human podocytes in vitro. Overexpression of FOXC2 in cultured human podocytes led to increased nuclear expression of FOXC2 associated with a change of cellular morphology. This was accompanied by upregulation of vimentin, a key mesenchymal marker, and active beta-catenin, associated with podocyte injury. We also observed re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton, disrupted localization of the tight junction protein ZO-1, and increased motility of podocytes overexpressing FOXC2. These data indicate that the expression of FOXC2 in podocytes needs to be tightly regulated, and that its overexpression induces a chain of cellular events leading to podocyte dysfunction. These changes may lead to podocyte detachment and depletion ultimately contributing to albuminuria. We also suggest a novel molecular mechanism linking obesity-induced decrease in adiponectin to podocyte dysfunction via upregulation of FOXC2.

Abstract: Tumor metastasis is the main reason of death for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Cell migration and invasion are two prerequisites for tumor metastasis, in which TRPM7 and MMPs play an important role. In our study, we found that bradykinin (BK) could upregulate the expression of TRPM7 and dynamically regulate the phosphorylation of non-muscle myosin IIA heavy chain (NMHC-IIA) Ser-1943 in HepG2 cells. The influx of Ca2+ via TRPM7 was necessary for elevating the activity of m-calpain and μ-calpain. Additionally, we observed that BK stimulated HepG2 cells to secrete more MMP2 but not MMP9. Src was critical in the process of MMP2 secretion and invadopodia formation. The heat map showed that BDKRB2, TRPM7 and MMP2 had higher overexpression proportions in 25 HCC cell lines. Some clinical specimens of HCC also indicated that BDKRB2 and MMP2 were overexpressed. In conclusion, BK promoted migration and invasion of HCC cells through TRPM7 and MMP2.

Abstract: Summary
The use of cells derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) for regenerative therapies confers a considerable risk for neoplastic growth and teratoma formation. Preclinical and clinical assessment of such therapies will require suitable monitoring strategies to understand and mitigate these risks. Here we generated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), selected clones that continued to express reprogramming factors after differentiation into cardiomyocytes, and transplanted these cardiomyocytes into immunocompromised rat hearts post-myocardial infarction. We compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cardiac ultrasound, and serum biomarkers for their ability to delineate teratoma formation and growth. MRI enabled the detection of teratomas with a volume >8 mm3. A combination of three plasma biomarkers (CEA, AFP, and HCG) was able to detect teratomas with a volume >17 mm3 and with a sensitivity of more than 87%. Based on our findings, a combination of serum biomarkers with MRI screening may offer the highest sensitivity for teratoma detection and tracking.

Abstract: The use of biosensors either individually or as part of panels has now become a common technique to capturing signaling events in living cells. Such biosensors have become particularly important for probing biased signaling and allostery in G protein-coupled receptor drug screening efforts. However, assumptions about the portability of such biosensors between cell types may lead to misinterpretation of drug effects on specific signaling pathways in a given cellular context. Further, the output of a particular biosensor may be different depending on where it is localized in a cell. Here, we discuss strategies to mitigate these concerns which should feed into future biosensor design and usage.

Abstract: In the nervous system, axons transmit information in the form of electrical impulses over long distances. The speed of impulse conduction is enhanced by myelin, a lipid-rich membrane that wraps around axons. Myelin also is required for the long-term health of axons by providing metabolic support. Accordingly, myelin deficiencies are implicated in a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, intellectual disabilities, and neurodegenerative conditions. Central nervous system myelin is formed by glial cells called oligodendrocytes. During development, oligodendrocyte precursor cells migrate from their origins to their target axons, extend long membrane processes that wrap axons, and produce the proteins and lipids that provide myelin membrane with its unique characteristics. Myelination is a dynamic process that involves intricate interactions between multiple cell types. Therefore, an in vivo myelination model, such as the zebrafish, which allows for live observation of cell dynamics and cell-to-cell interactions, is well suited for investigating oligodendrocyte development. Zebrafish offer several advantages to investigating myelination, including the use of transgenic reporter lines, live imaging, forward genetic screens, chemical screens, and reverse genetic approaches. This chapter will describe how these tools and approaches have provided new insights into the regulatory mechanisms that guide myelination.

Abstract: Human dental follicle cells (DFCs) and periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) derived from the ectomesenchymal tissue, have been shown to exhibit stem/progenitor cell properties and the ability to induce tissue regeneration. Stem cells in dental follicle differentiate into cementoblasts, periodontal ligament fibroblasts and osteoblasts, these cells form cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone, respectively. While stem cells in dental follicle are a precursor to periodontal ligament fibroblasts, the molecular changes that distinguish cultured DFCs from PDLCs are still unknown. In this study, we have compared the immunophenotypic features and cell cycle status of the two cell lines. The results suggest that DFCs and PDLCs displayed similar features related to immunophenotype and cell cycle. Then we employed an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics strategy to reveal the molecular differences between the two cell types. A total of 2138 proteins were identified and 39 of these proteins were consistently differentially expressed between DFCs and PDLCs. Gene ontology analyses revealed that the protein subsets expressed higher in PDLCs were related to actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding, and structural constituent of muscle. Upon validation by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) and caldesmon 1 (CALD1) were expressed higher in PDLCs than in DFCs. Our results suggested that PDLCs display enhanced actin cytoskeletal dynamics relative to DFCs while DFCs may exhibit a more robust antioxidant defense ability relative to PDLCs. This study expands our knowledge of the cultured DFCs and PDLCs proteome and provides new insights into possible mechanisms responsible for the different biological features observed in each cell type.

Abstract: Summary
Compartmentalization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of metazoans is critical for health. GI compartments contain specific microbiota, and microbiota dysbiosis is associated with intestinal dysfunction. Dysbiosis develops in aging intestines, yet how this relates to changes in GI compartmentalization remains unclear. The Drosophila GI tract is an accessible model to address this question. Here we show that the stomach-like copper cell region (CCR) in the middle midgut controls distribution and composition of the microbiota. We find that chronic activation of JAK/Stat signaling in the aging gut induces a metaplasia of the gastric epithelium, CCR decline, and subsequent commensal dysbiosis and epithelial dysplasia along the GI tract. Accordingly, inhibition of JAK/Stat signaling in the CCR specifically prevents age-related metaplasia, commensal dysbiosis and functional decline in old guts, and extends lifespan. Our results establish a mechanism by which age-related chronic inflammation causes the decline of intestinal compartmentalization and microbiota dysbiosis, limiting lifespan.

Abstract: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, septin mutations have severe effects on colony-forming ability, particularly at high temperatures, allowing the full variety of genetic tools available in this model organism to be applied to the study of septin biology. Although many details of septin function remain unknown, one can exploit a small number of easily scored phenotypes—proliferation capacity, cell morphology, septin localization, and septin ring integrity—as sensitive readouts of properly assembled septin filaments. Accordingly, this chapter focuses on genetic approaches targeted toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of de novo septin folding, heterooligomerization, and polymerization into filaments. The same general methods can be used to interrogate septin function, although interpretation of results can be more complicated. As genetic-based methodologies are technically simple but particularly dependent on interpretation, here I focus on the logic underlying the most common interpretations of results using septin mutants.

We aim to place the reader in a virtual lab experience to assist acquisition of the technical skills required for reproducing the published protocol. All materials, including catalog numbers for reagents and techniques for their preparation, are provided. Our protocols describe laser inactivation of egg chromosomes, the transfer of a cell through the oocyte micropyle, and spontaneous activation of the reconstructed embryo. High-quality eggs are the key to cloning success, and Chinook salmon ovarian fluid is indispensable for keeping eggs arrested at the metaphase of meiosis II. This protocol continues to be refined by our laboratory. However, naive investigators should be able to apply it in its present form to generate cloned zebrafish.

Abstract: Understanding species’ responses to environmental challenges is key to predicting future biodiversity. However, there is currently little data on how developmental stages affect responses and also whether universal gene biomarkers to environmental stress can be identified both within and between species. Using the Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica, as a model species, we examined both the tissue-specific and age-related (juvenile versus mature adult) gene expression response to acute non-lethal warming (12 h at 3 °C). In general, there was a relatively muted response to this sub-lethal thermal challenge when the expression profiles of treated animals, of either age, were compared with those of 0°C controls, with none of the “classical” stress response genes up-regulated. The expression profiles were very variable between the tissues of all animals, irrespective of age with no single transcript emerging as a universal biomarker of thermal stress. However, when the expression profiles of treated animals of the different age groups were directly compared, a very different pattern emerged. The profiles of the younger animals showed significant up-regulation of chaperone and antioxidant transcripts when compared with those of the older animals. Thus, the younger animals showed evidence of a more robust cellular response to warming. These data substantiate previous physiological analyses showing a more resilient juvenile population.

Abstract: Peripheral sensory organs and ganglia found in the vertebrate head arise during embryonic development from distinct ectodermal thickenings, called cranial sensory placodes (adenohypophyseal, olfactory, lens, trigeminal, epibranchial, and otic). A series of patterning events leads to the establishment of these placodes. Subsequently, these placodes undergo specific morphogenetic movements and cell-type specification in order to shape the final placodal derivatives and to produce differentiated cell types necessary for their function. In this chapter, we will focus on recent studies in the zebrafish that have advanced our understanding of cranial sensory placode development. We will summarize the signaling events and their molecular effectors guiding the formation of the so-called preplacodal region, and the subsequent subdivision of this region along the anteroposterior axis that gives rise to specific placode identities as well as those controlling morphogenesis and neurogenesis. Finally, we will highlight the approaches used in zebrafish that have been established to precisely label cell populations, to follow their development, and/or to characterize cell fates within a specific placode.

Abstract: Regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-response pathway during the course of diabetes specifically in renal tubules is unclear. Since tubule cell dysfunction is critical to progression of diabetic nephropathy, this study analyzed markers of ER stress response and ER chaperones at different stages of diabetes and in different renal tubule subtypes of OVE26 type-1 diabetic mice. ER stress-response-induced chaperones GRP78, GRP94, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) were increased in isolated cortical tubules of older diabetic mice, while PDI was decreased in tubules of young diabetic mice. Immunofluorescence staining of kidneys from older mice showed GRP78 and PDI upregulation in all cortical tubule segments, with substantial induction of PDI in distal tubules. Protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) phosphorylation was increased in cortical tubules of young diabetic mice, with no differences between older diabetic and control mice. Expression of ER stress-induced PERK inhibitor p58IPK was decreased and then increased in all tubule subtypes of young and older mice, respectively. Knockdown of PERK by small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased fibronectin secretion in cultured proximal tubule cells. Tubules of older diabetic mice had significantly more apoptotic cells, and ER stress-induced pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was increased in proximal and distal tubules of diabetic mice and diabetic humans. CHOP induction in OVE26 mice was not altered by severity of proteinuria. Overexpression of CHOP in cultured proximal tubule cells increased expression of fibronectin. These findings demonstrate differential ER stress-response signaling in tubule subtypes of diabetic mice and implicate a role for PERK and CHOP in tubule cell matrix protein production.

Abstract: Summary
The Helicobacter pylori adhesin BabA binds mucosal ABO/Leb blood group (bg) carbohydrates. BabA facilitates bacterial attachment to gastric surfaces, increasing strain virulence and forming a recognized risk factor for peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. High sequence variation causes BabA functional diversity, but the underlying structural-molecular determinants are unknown. We generated X-ray structures of representative BabA isoforms that reveal a polymorphic, three-pronged Leb binding site. Two diversity loops, DL1 and DL2, provide adaptive control to binding affinity, notably ABO versus O bg preference. H. pylori strains can switch bg preference with single DL1 amino acid substitutions, and can coexpress functionally divergent BabA isoforms. The anchor point for receptor binding is the embrace of an ABO fucose residue by a disulfide-clasped loop, which is inactivated by reduction. Treatment with the redox-active pharmaceutic N-acetylcysteine lowers gastric mucosal neutrophil infiltration in H. pylori-infected Leb-expressing mice, providing perspectives on possible H. pylori eradication therapies.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow (BM) represents a useful source of adult stem cells for cell therapy and tissue engineering. MSCs are present at a low frequency in the BM; therefore expansion is necessary before performing clinical studies. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a nutritional supplement for in vitro culture of MSCs is a suitable additive for human cell culture, but not regarding subsequent use of these cells for clinical treatment of human patients due to the risk of viral and prion transmission as well as xenogeneic immune responses after transplantation. Recently, autologous serum (AS) has been as a supplement to replace FBS in culture medium. We compared the effect of FBS versus AS on the histone modification pattern of MSCs through in vitro osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Differentiation of stem cells under various serum conditions to a committed state involves global changes in epigenetic patterns that are critically determined by chromatin modifications. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with real-time PCR showed significant changes in the acetylation and methylation patterns in lysine 9 (Lys9) of histone H3 on the regulatory regions of stemness (Nanog, Sox2, Rex1), osteogenic (Runx2, Oc, Sp7) and adipogenic (Ppar-γ, Lpl, adiponectin) marker genes in undifferentiated MSCs, FBS and AS. All epigenetic changes occurred in a serum dependent manner which resulted in higher expression level of stemness genes in undifferentiated MSCs compared to differentiated MSCs and increased expression levels of osteogenic genes in AS compared to FBS. Adipogenic genes showed greater expression in FBS compared to AS. These findings have demonstrated the epigenetic influence of serum culture conditions on differentiation potential of MSCs, which suggest that AS is possibly more efficient serum for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in cell therapy purposes.

Abstract: Summary
We established two human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines with a GGGGCC expansion in the C9orf72 gene (C9), and compared them with haploidentical and unrelated C9 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We found a marked difference in C9 methylation between the cells. hESCs and parental fibroblasts are entirely unmethylated while the iPSCs are hypermethylated. In addition, we show that the expansion alters promoter usage and interferes with the proper splicing of intron 1, eventually leading to the accumulation of repeat-containing mRNA following neural differentiation. These changes are attenuated in C9 iPSCs, presumably owing to hypermethylation. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of neural differentiation in the pathogenesis of disease and points to the potential role of hypermethylation as a neuroprotective mechanism against pathogenic mRNAs, envisaging a milder phenotype in C9 iPSCs.

Abstract: Direct conversion of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) offers an alternative strategy for cardiac disease modeling and regeneration. During iCM reprogramming, the starting fibroblasts must overcome existing epigenetic barriers to acquire the CM-like chromatin pattern. However, epigenetic dynamics along this reprogramming process have not been studied. Here, we took advantage of our recently generated polycistronic system and determined the dynamics of two critical histone marks, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in parallel with gene expression at a set of carefully selected cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming. We observed reduced H3K27me3 and increased H3K4me3 at cardiac promoters as early as day 3, paralleled by a rapid significant increase in their mRNA expression. In contrast, H3K27me3 at loci encoding fibroblast marker genes did not increase until day 10 and H3K4me3 progressively decreased along the reprogramming process; these changes were accompanied by a gradual decrease in the mRNA expression of fibroblast marker genes. Further analyses of fibroblast-enriched transcription factors revealed a similarly late deposition of H3K27me3 and decreased mRNA expression of Sox9, Twist1 and Twist2, three important players in epithelial−mesenchymal transition. Our data suggest early rapid activation of the cardiac program and later progressive suppression of fibroblast fate at both epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Additionally, we determined the DNA methylation states of representative cardiac promoters and found that not every single CpG was equally demethylated during early stages of iCM reprogramming. Rather, there are specific CpGs, whose demethylation states correlated tightly with transcription activation, that we propose are the major contributing CpGs. Our work thus reveals a differential re-patterning of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 at cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming and could provide future genome-wide epigenetic studies with important guidance such as the appropriate time window and loci to be utilized as positive and negative controls.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) show great promise for clinical and research applications, but their well-known proneness to genomic instability hampers the development to their full potential. Here, we demonstrate that medium acidification linked to culture density is the main cause of DNA damage and genomic alterations in hESC grown on feeder layers, and this even in the short time span of a single passage. In line with this, we show that increasing the frequency of the medium refreshments minimizes the levels of DNA damage and genetic instability. Also, we show that cells cultured on laminin-521 do not present this increase in DNA damage when grown at high density, although the (long-term) impact on their genomic stability remains to be elucidated. Our results explain the high levels of genome instability observed over the years by many laboratories worldwide, and show that the development of optimal culture conditions is key to solving this problem.

Abstract: Evidence indicates that the growth of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and malignant primary brain cancer, is driven by glioma stem cells (GSCs) resistant to current treatment. As Wnt-signaling is pivotal in stem cell maintenance, we wanted to explore its role in GSCs with the objective of finding distinct signaling mechanisms that could serve as potential therapeutic targets. We compared gene expression in GSCs (n=9) and neural stem cells from the adult human brain (ahNSC; n=3) to identify dysregulated genes in the Wnt signaling pathway. This identified a six-gene Wnt signature present in all nine primary GSC cultures, and the combined expression of three of these genes (SFRP1, SFRP4 and FZD7) reduced median survival of glioma patients from 38 to 17 months. Treatment with recombinant SFRP1 protein in primary cell cultures downregulated nuclear β-catenin and decreased in vitro proliferation and sphere formation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, expressional and functional analysis of SFRP1-treated GSCs revealed that SFRP1 halts cell cycling and induces apoptosis. These observations demonstrate that Wnt signaling is dysregulated in GSC, and that inhibition of the Wnt pathway could serve as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of GBM.

Abstract: p300 is a multifunctional transcriptional coactivator that interacts with numerous transcription factors and exhibits protein/histone acetyltransferase activity. Loss of p300 function in humans and in mice leads to craniofacial defects. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of p300 histone acetyltransferase activity with the compound, C646, altered the expression of several genes, including Cdh1 (E-cadherin) in mouse maxillary mesenchyme cells, which are the cells that give rise to the secondary palate. The increased expression of plasma membrane-bound E-cadherin was associated with reduced cytosolic β-catenin, that led to attenuated signaling through the canonical Wnt pathway. Furthermore, C646 reduced both cell proliferation and the migratory ability of these cells. These results suggest that p300 histone acetyltransferase activity is critical for Wnt-dependent palate mesenchymal cell proliferation and migration, both processes that play a significant role in morphogenesis of the palate.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the importance of immune variation for the symptoms and outcome of Lyme disease, the factors influencing cytokine production during infection with the causal pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi remain poorly understood. Borrelia infection-induced monocyte- and T cell-derived cytokines were profiled in peripheral blood from two healthy human cohorts of Western Europeans from the Human Functional Genomics Project. Both non-genetic and genetic host factors were found to influence Borrelia-induced cytokine responses. Age strongly impaired IL-22 responses, and genetic studies identified several independent QTLs that impact Borrelia-induced cytokine production. Genetic, transcriptomic, and functional validation studies revealed an important role for HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis in the cytokine response to Borrelia. HIF-1α pathway activation and increase in glycolysis-derived lactate was confirmed in Lyme disease patients. In conclusion, functional genomics approaches reveal the architecture of cytokine production induced by Borrelia infection of human primary leukocytes and suggest a connection between cellular glucose metabolism and Borrelia-induced cytokine production.

Abstract: Transcriptomic studies are important tools for understanding the development and function of the different cell types that make up complex tissues. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable organism for modeling key aspects of vertebrate development, cell biology, and human disease. However, the small size of individual larvae and relative scarcity of certain cell types in zebrafish can hamper efforts to collect enough pure material for cell type-specific transcriptomic studies. Thus, there is a need in the zebrafish field for spatially and temporally resolved gene expression assays. This chapter will discuss the general principles behind the TU-tagging method to isolate cell type-specific RNAs and provide guidance in designing and executing TU-tagging experiments in zebrafish.

Abstract: The enteric nervous system (ENS) forms intimate connections with many other intestinal cell types, including immune cells and bacterial consortia resident in the intestinal lumen. In this review, we highlight contributions of the zebrafish model to understanding interactions among these cells. Zebrafish is a powerful model for forward genetic screens, several of which have uncovered genes previously unknown to be important for ENS development. More recently, zebrafish has emerged as a model for testing functions of genes identified in human patients or large-scale human susceptibility screens. In several cases, zebrafish studies have revealed mechanisms connecting intestinal symptoms with other, seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes. Importantly, chemical library screens in zebrafish have provided startling new insights into potential effects of common drugs on ENS development. A key feature of the zebrafish model is the ability to rear large numbers of animals germ free or in association with only specific bacterial species. Studies utilizing these approaches have demonstrated the importance of bacterial signals for normal intestinal development. These types of studies also show how luminal bacteria and the immune system can contribute to inflammatory processes that can feedback to influence ENS development. The excellent optical properties of zebrafish embryos and larvae, coupled with the ease of generating genetically marked cells of both the host and its resident bacteria, allow visualization of multiple intestinal cell types in living larvae and should promote a more in-depth understanding of intestinal cell interactions, especially interactions between other intestinal cell types and the ENS.

Abstract: Summary
Class I lantibiotic dehydratases dehydrate selected Ser/Thr residues of a precursor peptide. Recent studies demonstrated the requirement of glutamyl-tRNAGlu for Ser/Thr activation by one of these enzymes (NisB) from the Firmicute Lactococcus lactis. However, the generality of glutamyl-tRNAGlu usage and the tRNA specificity of lantibiotic dehydratases have not been established. Here we report the 2.7-Å resolution crystal structure, along with the glutamyl-tRNAGlu utilization of MibB, a lantibiotic dehydratase from the Actinobacterium Microbispora sp. 107891 involved in the biosynthesis of the clinical candidate NAI-107. Biochemical assays revealed nucleotides A73 and U72 within the tRNAGlu acceptor stem to be important for MibB glutamyl-tRNAGlu usage. Using this knowledge, an expression system for the production of NAI-107 analogs in Escherichia coli was developed, overcoming the inability of MibB to utilize E. coli tRNAGlu. Our work provides evidence for a common tRNAGlu-dependent dehydration mechanism, paving the way for the characterization of lantibiotics from various phyla.

Abstract: Summary
Host genes that regulate systemic inflammation upon chronic viral infection are incompletely understood. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) infection is characterized by latency in macrophages, and reactivation is inhibited by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Using a lysozyme-M-cre (LysMcre) expression system, we show that deletion of autophagy-related (Atg) genes Fip200, beclin 1, Atg14, Atg16l1, Atg7, Atg3, and Atg5, in the myeloid compartment, inhibited MHV68 reactivation in macrophages. Atg5 deficiency did not alter reactivation from B cells, and effects on reactivation from macrophages were not explained by alterations in productive viral replication or the establishment of latency. Rather, chronic MHV68 infection triggered increased systemic inflammation, increased T cell production of IFN-γ, and an IFN-γ-induced transcriptional signature in macrophages from Atg gene-deficient mice. The Atg5-related reactivation defect was partially reversed by neutralization of IFN-γ. Thus Atg genes in myeloid cells dampen virus-induced systemic inflammation, creating an environment that fosters efficient MHV68 reactivation from latency.

Abstract: RNA-binding motif proteins (RBMs) belong to RNA-binding proteins that display extraordinary posttranscriptional gene regulation roles in various cellular processes, including development, growth, and stress responses. Nevertheless, only a few examples of the roles of RBMs are known in insects, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. In the present study, we characterized the novel RNA-binding motif protein 11 from Apis cerana cerana, which was named AccRBM11 and whose promoter sequence included abundant potential transcription factor binding sites that are connected to responses to adverse stress and early development. Quantitative PCR results suggested that AccRBM11 was expressed at highest levels in 1-day postemergence worker bees. AccRBM11 mRNA and protein levels were higher in the poison gland and the epidermis than in other tissues. Moreover, levels of AccRBM11 transcription were upregulated upon all the simulation of abiotic stresses. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated that AccRBM11 protein expression levels could be induced under some abiotic stressors, a result that did not completely in agree with the qRT-PCR results. It is also noteworthy that the expression of some genes that connected with development or stress responses were remarkably suppressed when AccRBM11 was silenced, which suggested that AccRBM11 might play a similar role in development or stress reactions with the above genes. Taken together, the data presented here provide evidence that AccRBM11 is potentially involved in the regulation of development and some abiotic stress responses. We expect that this study will promote future research on the function of RNA-binding proteins.

Abstract: Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) provide a model to investigate neurogenesis and develop mechanisms of cell transplantation. In order to define improved markers of stemness and lineage specificity, we examined self-renewal and multi-lineage markers during long-term expansion and under neuronal and astrocyte differentiating conditions in human ESC-derived NSCs (hNSC H9 cells). In addition, with proteoglycans ubiquitous to the neural niche, we also examined heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and their regulatory enzymes. Our results demonstrate that hNSC H9 cells maintain self-renewal and multipotent capacity during extended culture and express HS biosynthesis enzymes and several HSPG core protein syndecans (SDCs) and glypicans (GPCs) at a high level. In addition, hNSC H9 cells exhibit high neuronal and a restricted glial differentiative potential with lineage differentiation significantly increasing expression of many HS biosynthesis enzymes. Furthermore, neuronal differentiation of the cells upregulated SDC4, GPC1, GPC2, GPC3 and GPC6 expression with increased GPC4 expression observed under astrocyte culture conditions. Finally, downregulation of selected HSPG core proteins altered hNSC H9 cell lineage potential. These findings demonstrate an involvement for HSPGs in mediating hNSC maintenance and lineage commitment and their potential use as novel markers of hNSC and neural cell lineage specification.

Abstract: Summary
The cytokine IL-17, and signaling via its heterodimeric IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor, is critical for host defense against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens. Polarized lung epithelial cells express IL-17RA and IL-17RC basolaterally. However, their contribution to IL-17-dependent pulmonary defenses in vivo remains to be determined. To address this, we generated mice with conditional deletion of Il17ra or Il17rc in Scgb1a1-expressing club cells, a major component of the murine bronchiolar epithelium. These mice displayed an impaired ability to recruit neutrophils into the airway lumen in response to IL-17, a defect in bacterial clearance upon mucosal challenge with the pulmonary pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, and substantially reduced epithelial expression of the chemokine Cxcl5. Neutrophil recruitment and bacterial clearance were restored by intranasal administration of recombinant CXCL5. Our data show that IL-17R signaling in the lung epithelium plays a critical role in establishing chemokine gradients that are essential for mucosal immunity against pulmonary bacterial pathogens.

Abstract: Differentiated cells retain the genetic information of the donor but the extent to which phenotypic differences between donors or batches of differentiated cells are explained by variation introduced during the differentiation process is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated four separate batches of commercially available neurons originating from the same iPSCs to investigate whether the differentiation process used in manufacturing iPSCs to neurons affected genome-wide gene expression and modified cytosines, or neuronal sensitivity to drugs. No significant changes in gene expression, as measured by RNA-Seq, or cytosine modification levels, as measured by the Illumina 450K arrays, were observed between batches relative to changes over time. As expected, neurotoxic chemotherapeutics affected neuronal outgrowth, but no inter-batch differences were observed in sensitivity to paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. As a testament to the utility of the model for studies of neuropathy, we observed that genes involved in neuropathy had relatively higher expression levels in these samples across different time points. Our results suggest that the process used to differentiate iPSCs into neurons is consistent, resulting in minimal intra-individual variability across batches. Therefore, this model is reasonable for studies of human neuropathy, druggable targets to prevent neuropathy, and other neurological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) appear in response to several types of chronic injury in the human and rodent liver that often develop into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and primary liver cancers. However, the contribution of HPCs to the pathogenesis and progression of such liver diseases remains controversial. HPCs are generally defined as cells that can differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In this study, however, we found that HPCs isolated from the chronically injured liver can also give rise to myofibroblasts as a third type of descendant. While myofibroblast differentiation from HPCs is not significant in culture, during tumor development, HPCs can contribute to the formation of the tumor microenvironment by producing abundant myofibroblasts that might form a niche for tumor growth and survival. Thus, HPCs can be redefined as cells with a potential for differentiation into myofibroblasts that is specifically activated during tumor formation.

Abstract: The present study was designed to assess the possible protective effects of Quercetin (QUER), a flavonoid with well-known pharmacological effects, against Dichlorvos (DDVP)-induced toxicity in vitro using HCT116 cells. The cytotoxicity was monitored by cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, anti-oxidant enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and DNA fragmentation. The apoptosis was assessed through the measurement of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and caspase activation. The results indicated that pretreatment of HCT116 cells with QUER, 2 h prior to DDVP exposure, significantly decreased the DDVP-induced cell death, inhibited the ROS generation, modulated the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced the MDA level. The reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation were also attenuated by QUER. These findings suggest that dietary QUER can protect HCT116 cells against DDVP-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Abstract: Kallistatin is an endogenous protein that regulates differential signaling pathways and biological functions. Our previous studies showed that kallistatin gene therapy inhibited angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in mice, and kallistatin protein suppressed Wnt-mediated growth, migration and invasion by blocking Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. In this study, we show that kallistatin reduced cell viability, and increased apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Kallistatin also induced cancer cell autophagy, as evidenced by increased LC3B levels and elevated Atg5 and Beclin-1 expression; however, co-administration of Wnt or PPARγ antagonist GW9662 abolished these effects. Moreover, kallistatin via its heparin-binding site antagonized Wnt3a-induced cancer cell proliferation and increased PPARγ expression. Kallistatin inhibited oncogenic miR-21 synthesis associated with reduced Akt phosphorylation and Bcl-2 synthesis, but increased BAX expression. Kallistatin via PKC-ERK activation reduced miR-203 levels, leading to increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a tumor suppressor. Conversely, kallistatin stimulated expression of the tumorigenic suppressors miR-34a and p53. Kallistatin’s active site is essential for suppressing miR-21 and miR-203, and stimulating miR-34a and SOCS3 expression. This is the first study to demonstrate that kallistatin’s heparin-binding site is essential for inhibiting Wnt-mediated effects, and its active site plays a key role in regulating miR-21, miR-203, miR-34a and SOCS3 synthesis in breast cancer cells. These findings reveal novel mechanisms of kallistatin in inducing apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells, thus inhibiting tumor progression by regulation of Wnt/PPARγ signaling, as well as miR-21, miR-203 and miR-34a synthesis.

Abstract: Lgr4 (leucine-rich repeat domain containing G protein-coupled receptor 4) is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of multiple histone demethylases in the progression of diverse cancers, but there are few reports concerning the molecular mechanism by which Lgr4 regulates histone demethylase activation in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. As Jmjd2a is a histone demethylase, in the current study, we investigated the relationship between interaction Lgr4 with Jmjd 2a and Jmjd2a/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway in PCa progression. Firstly, Lgr4 was overexpressed by transfecting pcDNA3.1(+)/Lgr4 plasmids into PCa (LNCaP and PC-3) cell lines. Next, we found that Lgr4 overexpression promoted Jmjd2a mRNA expression, reduced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle in the S phase, these effects were reversed by Jmjd2a silencing. Moreover, Lgr4 overexpression markedly elevated AR levels and its interaction with Jmjd2a, which was tested by co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, interaction AR with PSA promoter (containing an AR response element) was obviously improved by Lgr4 overexpression, and PSA silencing reduced Lgr4-induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PCa cells. Taken together, Lgr4 may be a novel tumor marker providing new mechanistic insights into PCa progression. Lgr4 activates Jmjd2a/AR signaling pathway to promote interaction AR with PSA promoter, causing reduction of PCa apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

Abstract: Zebrafish is an excellent genetic and developmental model for the study of vertebrate development and disease. Its ability to produce an abundance of transparent, externally developed embryos has facilitated large-scale genetic and chemical screens for the identification of critical genes and chemical factors that modulate developmental pathways. These studies can have profound implications for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of human diseases. Recent advancements in molecular and genomic studies have provided valuable tools and resources for comprehensive and high-resolution analysis of epigenomes during cell specification and lineage differentiation throughout development. In this chapter, we describe two simple methods to evaluate protein–DNA interaction and chromatin architecture in erythrocytes from adult zebrafish. These are chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq). These techniques, together with gene expression profiling, are useful for analyzing epigenomic regulation of cell specification, differentiation, and function during zebrafish development in both normal and disease models

Abstract: Overexpression of the oncoprotein mortalin in cancer cells and its protein partners enables mortalin to promote multiple oncogenic signaling pathways and effectively antagonize chemotherapy-induced cell death. A UBX-domain-containing protein, UBXN2A, acts as a potential mortalin inhibitor. This current study determines whether UBXN2A effectively binds to and occupies mortalin’s binding pocket, resulting in a direct improvement in the tumor’s sensitivity to chemotherapy. Molecular modeling of human mortalin’s binding pocket and its binding to the SEP domain of UBXN2A followed by yeast two-hybrid and His-tag pull-down assays revealed that three amino acids (PRO442, ILE558, and LYS555) within the substrate-binding domain of mortalin are crucial for UBXN2A binding to mortalin. As revealed by chase experiments in the presence of cycloheximide, overexpression of UBXN2A seems to interfere with the mortalin-CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase and consequently suppresses the C‐terminus of the HSC70‐interacting protein (CHIP)-mediated destabilization of p53, resulting in its stabilization in the cytoplasm and upregulation in the nucleus. Overexpression of UBXN2A causes a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and the migration of colon cancer cells. We silenced UBXN2A in the human osteosarcoma U2OS cell line, an enriched mortalin cancer cell, followed by a clinical dosage of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The UBXN2A knockout U2OS cells revealed that UBXNA is essential for the cytotoxic effect achieved by 5-FU. UBXN2A overexpression markedly increased the apoptotic response of U2OS cells to the 5-FU. In addition, silencing of UBXN2A protein suppresses apoptosis enhanced by UBXN2A overexpression in U2OS. The knowledge gained from this study provides insights into the mechanistic role of UBXN2A as a potent mortalin inhibitor and as a potential chemotherapy sensitizer for clinical application.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in the scalable production of blood cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) open prospects for the clinical translation of de novo generated blood products, and evoke the need for preclinical evaluation of their efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in large animal models. Due to substantial similarities with humans, the outcomes of cellular therapies in non-human primate (NHP) models can be readily extrapolated to a clinical setting. However, the use of this model is hampered by relatively low efficiency of blood generation and lack of lymphoid potential in NHP-iPSC differentiation cultures. Here, we generated transgene-free iPSCs from different NHP species and showed the efficient induction of mesoderm, myeloid, and lymphoid cells from these iPSCs using a GSK3β inhibitor. Overall, our studies enable scalable production of hematopoietic progenitors from NHP-iPSCs, and lay the foundation for preclinical testing of iPSC-based therapies for blood and immune system diseases in an NHP model.

Abstract: Radioligand binding assays provide sensitive and quantitative information about guanine nucleotide protein G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expression and affinity for a wide variety of ligands, making them essential for drug structure-activity studies and basic GPCR research. Three basic radioligand binding protocols, saturation, indirect (competition, displacement, or modulation), and kinetic binding assays, are used to assess GPCR expression (Bmax), equilibrium dissociation constants for radioligands (Kd) and nonradioactive ligands (Ki), association and dissociation rates, and to distinguish competitive and allosteric mechanisms of GPCR-ligand interactions. Nonspecific radioligand binding may be mitigated by appropriate choices of reaction conditions. Radioligand depletion (bound radioactivity >10% of total radioligand), which compromises accuracy of Kd and Ki measurements, can be limited by adjusting receptor concentration and appropriate radioligand choice. Accurate Kd and Ki values in saturation and indirect binding assays depend on binding equilibrium. Equilibration time for high-affinity ligands, with slow dissociation rates, may require much extended incubation times or increased incubation temperature.

Abstract: Summary
New targets for antiviral strategies are needed against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a major human pathogen. A cell-based screen aimed at finding inhibitors of the viral transcription factor Immediate-Early 2 (IE2) was performed in HCMV-infected cells expressing EGFP under the control of an IE2-inducible viral promoter. Screening of a library of bioactive small molecules led to the identification of several compounds able to inhibit EGFP expression and also HCMV replication with potency in the low-micromolar range. Follow-up studies with four selected hits indicated that they all block viral DNA synthesis as well as viral Early and Late gene expression. Furthermore, mechanistic studies confirmed that the compounds specifically act via inhibition of IE2 transactivating activity, thus blocking viral Early gene expression and the progression of virus replication. These results provide proof of concept for identifying small molecules that modulate the activity of a microbial transcription factor to control pathogen replication.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of the zebrafish as a cancer model has been aided by advances in genetic, chemical, and imaging technologies. Melanoma in particular highlights both the power and challenges associated with cancer modeling in zebrafish. This chapter focuses on the lessons that have emerged from the melanoma models as paradigmatic of what will apply to nearly all cancer models in the zebrafish system. We specifically focus on methodologies related to germline and mosaic transgenic melanoma generation, and how these can be used to deeply interrogate additional cooperating oncogenes or tumor suppressors. These transgenic tumors can in turn be used to generate zebrafish-specific, stable melanoma cell lines which can be fluorescently labeled, modified by cDNA/CRISPR techniques, and used for detailed in vivo imaging of cancer progression in real time. These zebrafish melanoma models are beginning to elucidate both cell intrinsic and microenvironmental factors in melanoma that have broader implications for human disease. We envision that nearly all of the techniques described here can be applied to other zebrafish cancer models, and likely expanded beyond what we describe here.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic inflammatory disorders are thought to arise due to an interplay between predisposing host genetics and environmental factors. For example, the onset of inflammatory bowel disease is associated with enteric proteobacterial infection, yet the mechanistic basis for this association is unclear. We have shown previously that genetic defiency in TLR1 promotes acute enteric infection by the proteobacteria Yersinia enterocolitica. Examining that model further, we uncovered an altered cellular immune response that promotes the recruitment of neutrophils which in turn increases metabolism of the respiratory electron acceptor tetrathionate by Yersinia. These events drive permanent alterations in anti-commensal immunity, microbiota composition, and chronic inflammation, which persist long after Yersinia clearence. Deletion of the bacterial genes involved in tetrathionate respiration or treatment using targeted probiotics could prevent microbiota alterations and inflammation. Thus, acute infection can drive long term immune and microbiota alterations leading to chronic inflammatory disease in genetically predisposed individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Upon sensing cytoplasmic retroviral DNA in infected cells, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) produces the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, which activates STING to trigger a type I interferon (IFN) response. We find that membrane fusion-inducing contact between donor cells expressing the HIV envelope (Env) and primary macrophages endogenously expressing the HIV receptor CD4 and coreceptor enable intercellular transfer of cGAMP. This cGAMP exchange results in STING-dependent antiviral IFN responses in target macrophages and protection from HIV infection. Furthermore, under conditions allowing cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1, infected primary T cells, but not cell-free virions, deliver cGAMP to autologous macrophages through HIV-1 Env and CD4/coreceptor-mediated membrane fusion sites and induce a STING-dependent, but cGAS-independent, IFN response in target cells. Collectively, these findings identify an infection-specific mode of horizontal transfer of cGAMP between primary immune cells that may boost antiviral responses, particularly in infected tissues in which cell-to-cell transmission of virions exceeds cell-free infection.

Abstract: Summary
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with increased intestinal translocation of microbial products and enteropathy as well as alterations in gut bacterial communities. However, whether the enteric virome contributes to this infection and resulting immunodeficiency remains unknown. We characterized the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a cohort of Ugandan patients, including HIV-uninfected or HIV-infected subjects and those either treated with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) or untreated. Low peripheral CD4 T cell counts were associated with an expansion of enteric adenovirus sequences and this increase was independent of ART treatment. Additionally, the enteric bacterial microbiome of patients with lower CD4 T counts exhibited reduced phylogenetic diversity and richness with specific bacteria showing differential abundance, including increases in Enterobacteriaceae, which have been associated with inflammation. Thus, immunodeficiency in progressive HIV infection is associated with alterations in the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome, which may contribute to AIDS-associated enteropathy and disease progression.

Abstract: Several eye diseases are associated with axonal injury in the optic nerve, which normally leads to degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and subsequently to loss of vision. There is experimental evidence that some members of the small heat shock protein family (HspBs) are upregulated upon optic nerve injury (ONI) in the retina and sufficient to promote RGC survival. These data raise the question as to whether other family members may play a similar role in this context. Here, we performed a comprehensive comparative study comprising all HspBs in an experimental model of ONI. We found that five HspBs were expressed in the adult rat retina at control conditions but only HspB1 and HspB5 were upregulated in response to ONI. Furthermore, HspB1 and HspB5 were constitutively phosphorylated in Müller cells at serine 15 and serine 59, respectively. In RGCs, phosphorylation was stimulated by ONI and occurred at serine 86 of HspB1 and at serine 19 and 45 of HspB5. These data suggest that of all small heat shock proteins, only HspB1 and HspB5 might be of protective value for RGCs after ONI and that this process might be regulated by phosphorylation at serine 86 of HspB1 and serine 19 and serine 45 of HspB5. The molecular targets of phosphoHspB1 and phosphoHspB5 remain to be identified.

Abstract: Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation in R26-SmoM2;CAGGS-CreER mice, which carry a tamoxifen-inducible activated Smoothened allele (SmoM2), results in numerous microscopic tumor foci in mouse skeletal muscle. These tumors exhibit a highly differentiated myogenic phenotype and resemble human fetal rhabdomyomas. This study sought to apply previously established strategies to isolate lineally distinct populations of normal mouse myofiber-associated cells in order to examine cellular heterogeneity in SmoM2 tumors. We demonstrate that established SmoM2 tumors are composed of cells expressing myogenic, adipocytic and hematopoietic lineage markers and differentiation capacity. SmoM2 tumors thus recapitulate the phenotypic and functional hetereogeneity observed in normal mouse skeletal muscle. SmoM2 tumors also contain an expanded population of PAX7+ and MyoD+ satellite-like cells with extremely low clonogenic activity. Selective activation of Hh signaling in freshly isolated muscle satellite cells enhanced terminal myogenic differentiation without stimulating proliferation. Our findings support the conclusion that SmoM2 tumors represent an aberrant skeletal muscle state and demonstrate that, similar to normal muscle, myogenic tumors contain functionally distinct cell subsets, including cells lacking myogenic differentiation potential.

Although a strong dependence of some tumor types on exogenous arginine sources has been reported, the mechanisms of arginine sensing by tumor cells and the impact of changes in arginine availability on translation and cell cycle regulation are not fully understood. The results presented herein state that human colorectal carcinoma cells rapidly exhaust the internal arginine sources in the absence of exogenous arginine and repress global translation by activation of the GCN2-mediated pathway and inhibition of mTOR signaling. Tumor suppressor protein p53 activation and G1/G0 cell cycle arrest support cell survival upon prolonged arginine starvation. Cells with the mutant or deleted TP53 fail to stop cell cycle progression at defined cell cycle checkpoints which appears to be associated with reduced recovery after durable metabolic stress triggered by arginine withdrawal.

Abstract: Lactose is a milk-specific carbohydrate synthesized by mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in mammary glands during lactation. Lactose synthesis is downregulated under conditions causing inflammation such as mastitis, in which MECs are exposed to high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated whether inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) directly influence the lactose synthesis pathway by using two types of murine MEC culture models: the monolayer culture of MECs to induce lactogenesis; and the three-dimensional culture of MECs surrounded by Matrigel to induce reconstitution of the alveolar structure in vitro. TNF-α caused severe down-regulation of lactose synthesis-related genes concurrently with the degradation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) from the basolateral membranes in MECs. IL-1β also caused degradation of GLUT1 along with a decrease in the expression level of β-1,4-galactosylransferase 3. IL-6 caused both up-regulation and down-regulation of the expression levels of lactose synthesis-related genes in MECs. These results indicate that TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 have different effects on the lactose synthesis pathway in MECs. Furthermore, TNF-α triggered activation of NFκB and inactivation of STAT5, suggesting that NFκB and STAT5 signaling pathways are involved in the multiple adverse effects of TNF-α on the lactose synthesis pathway.

Abstract: Deregulation of glycolysis was often observed in human cancer cells. In the present study, we reported resveratrol, a small polyphenol, which has been intensively studied in various tumor models, has a profound anti-tumor effect on human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via regulation of glycolysis. Resveratrol impaired hexokinase II (HK2)-mediated glycolysis, and markedly inhibited anchorage-dependent and –independent growth of NSCLC cells. Exposure to resveratrol decreased EGFR and downstream kinases Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, we revealed that resveratrol impaired glucose metabolism by mainly inhibiting expression of HK2 mediated by the Akt signaling pathway, and exogenous overexpression of constitutively activated Akt1 in NSCLC cells substantially rescued resveratrol-induced glycolysis suppression. The in vivo data indicated that resveratrol obviously suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Our results suggest targeting HK2 or metabolic enzymes appears to be a new approach for clinical NSCLC prevention or treatment.

Biomechanical insult switches PEA-15 activity to uncouple its anti-apoptotic function and promote erk mediated tissue remodeling,

Abstract: Biomechanical insult contributes to many chronic pathological processes, yet the resulting influences on signal transduction mechanisms are poorly understood. The retina presents an excellent mechanotransduction model, as mechanical strain on sensitive astrocytes of the optic nerve head (ONH) is intimately linked to chronic tissue remodeling and excavation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and apoptotic cell death. However, the mechanism by which these effects are induced by biomechanical strain is unclear. We previously identified the small adapter protein, PEA-15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes), through proteomic analyses of human ONH astrocytes subjected to pathologically relevant biomechanical insult. Under resting conditions PEA-15 is regulated through phosphorylation of two key serine residues to inhibit extrinsic apoptosis and ERK1/2 signaling. However, we surprisingly observed that biomechanical insult dramatically switches PEA-15 phosphorylation and function to uncouple its anti-apoptotic activity, and promote ERK1/2-dependent MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion. These results reveal a novel cell autonomous mechanism by which biomechanical strain rapidly modifies this signaling pathway to generate altered tissue injury responses.

Abstract: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of cell surface receptors, are involved in many physiological processes. They represent highly important therapeutic targets for drug discovery. Currently, there are numerous cell-based assays developed for the pharmacological profiling of GPCRs and the identification of novel agonists and antagonists. However, the development of new, faster, easier, and more cost-effective approaches to detect GPCR activity remains highly desirable. β-arrestin-dependent internalization has been demonstrated to be a common mechanism for most GPCRs. Here we describe a novel assay for quantitative analysis of GPCR internalization based on DnaE intein-mediated reconstitution of fragmented Renilla luciferase or Firefly luciferase when activated GPCRs interact with β-arrestin2 or Rab5. Further validation, using functionally divergent GPCRs, showed that EC50 values obtained for the known agonists and antagonists were in close agreement with the results of previous reports. This suggests that this assay is sensitive enough to permit quantification of GPCR internalization. Compared with conventional assays, this novel assay system is cost-effective, rapid, and easy to manipulate. These advantages may allow this assay to be used universally as a functional cell-based system for GPCR characterization and in the screening process of drug discovery.

Abstract: CD1a is involved in presentation to the immune system of lipid antigen derived from tumor cells with subsequent T cell activation. Hsp60 is a molecular chaperone implicated in carcinogenesis by, for instance, modulating the immune reaction against the tumor. We have previously postulated a synergism between CD1a and Hsp60 as a key factor in the activation of an effective antitumor immune response in squamous epithelia. Keratoacantomas (KAs) are benign tumors that however can transform into squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), but the reasons for this malignization are unknown. In a previous study, we found that CD1a-positive cells are significantly more numerous in KA than in SCC. In this study, we analyzed a series of KAs and SCCs by immunohistochemistry for CD1a and Hsp60. Our results show that the levels of both are significantly lower in KA than in SCC and support the hypothesis that KA may evolve towards SCC if there is a failure of the local modulation of the antitumor immune response. The data also show that immunohistochemistry for CD1a and Hsp60 can be of help in differential diagnosis between KAs and well-differentiated forms of SCC.

Abstract: Septins are highly conserved cytoskeletal proteins involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell polarization and cytokinesis. In humans, functional defects in these proteins have been linked to cancer and neuronal diseases. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in studying the structure of septin subunits and the formation of defined heteromeric building blocks. These are assembled into higher-order structures at distinct subcellular sites. An important microscopic approach in studying septin assembly and dynamics is the use of septins tagged with fluorescent proteins. This revealed, eg, that septins form rings during cytokinesis and that septins build extended filaments partially colocalizing with actin cables and microtubules. Here, we describe extensive live cell imaging of septins in the model microorganism Ustilago maydis. We present techniques to study dynamic localization of protein and septin mRNA on shuttling endosomes as well as colocalization of proteins at these highly motile units. Moreover, FLIM-FRET experiments for analyzing local protein interactions are presented. Importantly, these imaging approaches transfer well to other fungal and animal model systems for in vivo analysis of septin dynamics.

Pleiotropic effects of antitumour alkylphospholipids on cholesterol transport and metabolism,

Abstract: Background
Alkylphospholipid (APL) analogs are a new class of membrane-directed synthetic compounds with a variety of biological actions and clinical applications. In particular, these agents are promising candidates in cancer treatment. We have demonstrated that after prolonged treatment APLs alter intracellular cholesterol traffic and metabolism in human tumor-cell lines, leading to an accumulation of cholesterol inside the cell. After further investigation concerning the mode of action of APLs, we have explored the influence of several APLs on novel aspects of cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis using hepatoma HepG2 cells and THP1-derived macrophages.
Methods
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis with a pathway-focused PCR array system was performed to measure relative changes in the mRNA expression of a number of genes related to cholesterol transport and metabolism. We compared the gene-expression profiles of HepG2 cells treated with miltefosine, edelfosine or perifosine for 6h and 24h with the profile of control cells. We also analysed particular genes of interest in both HepG2 and macrophage-like THP1 cells using specific PCR assays. Immunoblots were used to confirm protein-expression changes. Measurement of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux was determined using apoA1 as cholesterol acceptor.
Results
We found global changes in gene-expression patterns to maintain cholesterol homeostasis after exposure of cells to APLs. The pathways for cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL-cholesterol uptake were both transcriptionally upregulated by the three APLs assayed. Conversely, major pathways involved in the catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids and lipoprotein-associated cholesterol export were impaired after APL incubation, which may well contribute to the higher cell-cholesterol levels induced by these compounds.
Conclusion
Incubation of cells with different APLs stimulated cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake at the same time as it depressed common pathways for excess cholesterol removal in tumor cells, ultimately leading to altered cholesterol homeostasis.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a class of highly conserved proteins produced in virtually all living organisms from bacteria to humans. Hsp60 and Hsp10, the most important mitochondrial chaperones, participate in environmental stress responses. In this study, the full-length complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of Hsp60 (PmHsp60) and Hsp10 (PmHsp10) were cloned from Penaeus monodon. Sequence analysis showed that PmHsp60 and PmHsp10 encoded polypeptides of 578 and 102 amino acids, respectively. The expression profiles of PmHsp60 and PmHsp10 were detected in the gills and hepatopancreas of the shrimps under pH challenge, osmotic stress, and heavy metal exposure, and results suggested that PmHsp60 and PmHsp10 were involved in the responses to these stimuli. ATPase and chaperone activity assay indicated that PmHsp60 could slow down protein denaturation and that Hsp60/Hsp10 may be combined to produce a chaperone complex with effective chaperone and ATPase activities. Overall, this study provides useful information to help further understand the functional mechanisms of the environmental stress responses of Hsp60 and Hsp10 in shrimp.

Abstract: The TALE nuclease and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated systems (Cas) have been developed as important tools for genome editing in zebrafish. Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach for generating site-specific gene targeting in zebrafish using DNA double-strand breaks induced homologous recombination (HR)-dependent repair mechanism. Through comicroinjection of Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA targeting genomic DNA sequence corresponding to the twist2 gene and the corresponding double-strand long arm donor template with a point mutation identified in human, HR-mediated knock-in of the expected targeting sequence was obtained. To facilitate identification of germline transmission of targeted mutation, a method of screening sperms of male founder fish is designed.

Abstract: Summary
Following injury, adult skeletal muscle undergoes a well-coordinated sequence of molecular and physiological events to promote repair and regeneration. However, a thorough understanding of the in vivo epigenomic and transcriptional mechanisms that control these reparative events is lacking. To address this, we monitored the in vivo dynamics of three histone modifications and coding and noncoding RNA expression throughout the regenerative process in a mouse model of traumatic muscle injury. We first illustrate how both coding and noncoding RNAs in tissues and sorted satellite cells are modified and regulated during various stages after trauma. Next, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to evaluate the chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers) and view how these elements evolve and influence various muscle repair and regeneration transcriptional programs. These results provide a comprehensive view of the central factors that regulate muscle regeneration and underscore the multiple levels through which both transcriptional and epigenetic patterns are regulated to enact appropriate repair and regeneration.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal transgene regulation by transgenic DNA recombinases is a central tool for reverse genetics in multicellular organisms, with excellent applications for misexpression and lineage tracing experiments. One of the most widespread technologies for this purpose is Cre recombinase-controlled lox site recombination that is attracting increasing interest in the zebrafish field. Tol2-mediated zebrafish transgenesis provides a stable platform to integrate lox cassette transgenes, while the amenability of the zebrafish embryo to drug treatments makes the model an ideal candidate for tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 experiments. In addition, advanced transgenesis technologies such as phiC31 or CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-ins are even further promoting zebrafish transgenesis for Cre/lox applications. In this chapter, we will first introduce the basics of Cre/lox methodology, CreERT2 regulation by tamoxifen, as well as the utility of Tol2 and other contemporary transgenesis techniques for Cre/lox experiments. We will then outline in detail practical experimental steps for efficient transgenesis toward the creation of single-insertion transgenes and will introduce protocols for 4-hydroxytamoxifen-mediated CreERT2 induction to perform spatiotemporal lox transgene regulation experiments in zebrafish embryos. Last, we will discuss advanced experimental applications of Cre/lox beyond traditional lineage tracing approaches.

Abstract: Septins are guanine nucleotide–binding proteins that are conserved from fungi to humans. Septins assemble into heterooligomeric complexes and higher-order structures with key roles in various cellular functions including cell migration and division. The mechanisms by which septins assemble and interact with other cytoskeletal elements like actin remain elusive. A powerful approach to address this question is by cell-free reconstitution of purified cytoskeletal proteins combined with fluorescence microscopy. Here, we describe procedures for the purification of recombinant Drosophila and human septin hexamers from Escherichia coli and reconstitution of actin–septin coassembly. These procedures can be used to compare assembly of Drosophila and human septins and their coassembly with the actin cytoskeleton by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.

Abstract: Primary human skeletal muscle cells (hSkMCs) are invaluable tools for deciphering the basic molecular mechanisms of muscle-related biological processes and pathological alterations. Nevertheless, their use is quite restricted due to poor availability, short life span and variable purity of the cells during in vitro culture. Here, we evaluate a recently published method of hSkMCs immortalization, relying on ectopic expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and telomerase (TERT) in myoblasts from healthy donors (n=3) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n=2). The efficacy to maintain the myogenic and non-transformed phenotype, as well as the main pathogenetic hallmarks of DM1, has been assessed. Combined expression of the three genes i) maintained the CD56(NCAM)-positive myoblast population and differentiation potential; ii) preserved the non-transformed phenotype and iii) maintained the CTG repeat length, amount of nuclear foci and aberrant alternative splicing in immortal muscle cells. Moreover, immortal hSkMCs displayed attractive additional features such as structural maturation of sarcomeres, persistence of Pax7-positive cells during differentiation and complete disappearance of nuclear foci following (CAG)7 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment. Overall, the CCND1, CDK4 and TERT immortalization yields versatile, reliable and extremely useful human muscle cell models to investigate the basic molecular features of human muscle cell biology, to elucidate the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms and to test new therapeutic approaches for DM1 in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Mutation of the Gap Junction Beta 2 gene (GJB2) encoding connexin 26 (CX26) is the most frequent cause of hereditary deafness worldwide and accounts for up to 50% of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss cases in some populations. Therefore, cochlear CX26-gap junction plaque (GJP)-forming cells such as cochlear supporting cells are thought to be the most important therapeutic target for the treatment of hereditary deafness. The differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into cochlear CX26-GJP-forming cells has not been reported. Here, we detail the development of a novel strategy to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells into functional CX26-GJP-forming cells that exhibit spontaneous ATP- and hemichannel-mediated Ca2+ transients typical of the developing cochlea. Furthermore, these cells from CX26-deficient mice recapitulated the drastic disruption of GJPs, the primary pathology of GJB2-related hearing loss. These in vitro models should be useful for establishing inner-ear cell therapies and drug screening that target GJB2-related hearing loss.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal structure of nuclear DNA is usually maintained by insertion of nucleosomes into preexisting chromatin, both on newly synthesized DNA at replication forks and at sites of DNA damage. But during retrovirus infection, a histone-free DNA copy of the viral genome is synthesized that must be loaded with nucleosomes de novo. Here, we show that core histones are rapidly loaded onto unintegrated Moloney murine leukemia virus DNAs. Loading of nucleosomes requires nuclear entry, but does not require viral DNA integration. The histones associated with unintegrated DNAs become marked by covalent modifications, with a delay relative to the time of core histone loading. Expression from unintegrated DNA can be enhanced by modulation of the histone-modifying machinery. The data show that histone loading onto unintegrated DNAs occurs very rapidly after nuclear entry and does not require prior establishment of an integrated provirus.

Abstract: Genomic DNA methylation functions to repress gene expression by interfering with transcription factor binding and/or recruiting repressive chromatin machinery. Recent data support contribution of regulated DNA methylation to embryonic pluripotency, development, and tissue differentiation; this important epigenetic mark is chemically stable yet enzymatically reversible—and heritable through the germline. Importantly, all the major components involved in dynamic DNA methylation are conserved in zebrafish, including the factors that “write, read, and erase” this mark. Therefore, the zebrafish has become an excellent model for studying most biological processes associated with DNA methylation in mammals. Here we briefly review the zebrafish model for studying DNA methylation and describe a series of methods for performing genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. We address and provide methods for methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-Seq), bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq), and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS-Seq).

Abstract: Primary cilia are cellular antennae that receive and transduce extracellular cues. These microtubule-rich structures are comprised of at least three distinct ciliary compartments: basal bodies, transition zone, and axoneme. Septins have been implicated in cilia function at the transition zone, but accumulating evidence suggests that they localize predominantly within the axoneme. Here, we describe three fixation conditions that preserve the substructure of primary cilia and demonstrate known ciliary proteins that localize to these distinct ciliary substructures. Finally, we show immunostaining and live microscopy methods to detect septins within the axoneme.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) plays an important role in regulating bone remodeling, and GLP-1 receptor agonist shows a positive relationship with osteoblast activity. However, GLP-1 receptor is not found in osteoblast, and the mechanism of GLP-1 receptor agonist on regulating bone remodeling is unclear. Here, we show that the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4) promoted bone formation and increased bone mass and quality in a rat unloading-induced bone loss model. These functions were accompanied by an increase in osteoblast number and serum bone formation markers, while the adipocyte number was decreased. Furthermore, GLP-1 receptor was detected in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but not in osteoblast. Activation of GLP-1 receptor by Ex-4 promoted the osteogenic differentiation and inhibited BMSC adipogenic differentiation through regulating PKA/β-catenin and PKA/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling. These findings reveal that GLP-1 receptor regulates BMSC osteogenic differentiation and provide a molecular basis for therapeutic potential of GLP-1 against osteoporosis.

Abstract: The airway epithelium is a barrier to the inhaled antigens and pathogens. Connexin 43 (Cx43) has been found to play critical role in maintaining the function of airway epithelial barrier and be involved in the pathogenesis of the diabetic retinal vasculature, diabetes nephropathy and diabetes skin. Hyperglycemia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for respiratory infections. We hypothesize that the down-regulation of Cx43 induced by HG alters the expression of tight junctions (zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin) and contributes to dysfunction of airway epithelial barrier, and Cx43 plays a critical role in the process in human airway epithelial cells (16HBE). We show that high glucose (HG) decreased the expression of ZO-1 and occludin, disassociated interaction between Cx43 and tight junctions, and then increased airway epithelial transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and permeability by down-regulation of Cx43 in human airway epithelial cells. These observations demonstrate an important role for Cx43 in regulating HG-induced dysfunction of airway epithelial barrier. These findings may bring new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of pulmonary infection related to diabetes mellitus and lead to novel therapeutic intervention for the dysfunction of airway epithelial barrier in chronic inflammatory airway diseases.

Abstract: A multitude of physiological processes regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling are accomplished by the participation of active rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. In general, it is common that a cross talk occurs among networks of microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments in order to reach specific cell responses. In particular, actin–cytoskeleton dynamics regulate processes such as cell shape, cell division, cell motility, and cell polarization, among others. This chapter describes the current knowledge about the regulation of actin–cytoskeleton dynamic by diverse GPCR signaling pathways, and also includes some protocols combining immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy for the visualization of the different rearrangements of the actin–cytoskeleton. We report how both the S1P-GPCR/G12/13/Rho/ROCK and glucagon-GPCR/Gs/cAMP axes induce differential actin–cytoskeleton rearrangements in epithelial cells. We also show that specific actin-binding molecules, like phalloidin and LifeAct, are very useful to analyze F-actin reorganization by confocal microscopy, and also that both molecules show similar results in fixed cells, whereas the anti-actin antibody is useful to detect both the G- and F-actin, as well as their compartmentalization. Thus, it is highly recommended to utilize different approaches to investigate the regulation of actin dynamics by GPCR signaling, with the aim to get a better picture of the phenomenon under study.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are critical for the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which includes cartilage-specific collagen types I, II and XI. We previously found that PEP-1-sirtuin (SIRT)2 could induce dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes; however, the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. We addressed this in the present study by examining the association between PEP-1-SIRT2 and the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13 and type II collagen in rabbit articular chondrocytes. We found that PEP-1-SIRT2 increased MMP-1 and -13 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as determined by western blotting. A similar trend in MMP-1 and -13 levels was observed in cultures during expansion to four passages. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP-1 and -13 blocked the PEP-1–SIRT2-induced decrease in type II collagen level. Phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) was increased by PEP-1–SIRT2; however, treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059 suppressed PEP-1–SIRT2-induced MMP-1 and -13 expression and dedifferentiation while restoring type II collagen expression in passage 2 cells. These results suggest that PEP-1–SIRT2 promotes MMP-induced dedifferentiation via ERK signaling in articular chondrocytes.

Abstract: The genes encoding HSP70 and HSP90 proteins were isolated from kaluga by homologous cloning and rapid amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends (RACE). HSP70 (GenBank accession no. KP050541) and HSP90 (GenBank accession no. KP050542) cDNAs were composed of 2275 and 2718 bp and encoded polypeptides of 650 and 725 amino acids, respectively. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis showed that HSP70 and HSP90 of kaluga shared high identities with those of Acipenser ruthenus, Acipenser schrenckii, and Acipenser baerii (98–99 %). Fluorescent real-time RT-PCR under unstressed conditions revealed that HSP70 and HSP90 were expressed in 11 different tissues of kaluga. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of both HSP70 and HSP90 were highest in the intestine and lowest in the muscle. In addition, the patterns of mRNA expression of HSP70 and HSP90 were similar, although the level of expression was more in HSP90 than in HSP70 (P < 0.05).We also analyzed patterns of HSP70 and HSP90 expression in the muscle, gill, and liver of kaluga under different combinations of temperature and salinity stress, including temperatures of 4,10, 25, and 28°C at 0 ppt salinity, and salinities of 10, 20, 30, and 40 ppt at 16 °C, where 16°C at 0 ppt (parts per thousand) served as the control. We found that levels of mRNA expression of both HSP70 and HSP90 were highest at 4°C in the muscle, gill, and liver and changed little with salinity stress. These results increase understanding of the mechanisms of stress response of cold freshwater fish.

Abstract: To improve our understanding of pattern formation during development and disease we heavily rely on the identification of novel regulators and pathways. While RNA sequencing yields genome-wide expression data that suit this purpose, it lacks spatial resolution. Such spatial resolution can be obtained by microscopy-based methods like in situ hybridization, but these fail to provide information on more than a few genes at a time. Here, we describe tomo-seq, a technique that combines the advantages of the above-mentioned approaches and provides genome-wide expression data with spatial information. The tomo-seq technique is based on cryosectioning of an embryo or tissue of interest and performing RNA-seq on individual sections. Using this method, we have generated genome-wide transcriptomics with high spatial resolution of the whole zebrafish embryo at various stages of development (Junker et al., 2014) and of adult zebrafish hearts after injury (Wu et al., 2016).

Abstract: Functional studies in Drosophila have been key for establishing a role for the septin family of proteins in animal cell division and thus extending for the first time observations from the budding yeast to animal cells. Visualizing the distribution of specific septins in different Drosophila tissues and, in particular, in the Drosophila embryo, together with biochemical and mutant phenotype data, has contributed important advances to our understanding of animal septin biology, suggesting roles in processes other than in cytokinesis. Septin localization using immunofluorescence assays has been possible due to the generation of antibodies against different Drosophila septins. The recent availability of lines expressing fluorescent protein fusions of specific septins further promises to facilitate studies on septin dynamics. Here, we provide protocols for preparing early Drosophila embryos to visualize septins using immunofluorescence assays and live fluorescence microscopy. The genetic tractability of the Drosophila embryo together with its amenability to high-resolution fluorescence microscopy promises to provide novel insights into animal septin structure and function.

Abstract: Acidic conditions are present in degenerated intervertebral discs and are believed to be responsible for matrix breakdown. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is expressed in endplate chondrocytes, and its activation is associated with endplate chondrocyte apoptosis. However, the precise role of ASIC1a in regulating the matrix metabolic activity of endplate chondrocytes in response to extracellular acid remains poorly understood. Aggrecan (ACAN), type II collagen (Col2a1), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expressions were determined using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blot. ASIC1a was knocked down by transfecting endplate chondrocytes with ASIC1a siRNA. MMP activity and NF-κB transcriptional activity were measured. NF-κB transcriptional activity was assessed by examining cytosolic phosphorylated IκBα and nuclear phosphorylated p65 levels. Extracellular acidic solution (pH 6.0) resulted in a decrease in ACAN and Co12a1 expressions and an increase in MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 expressions, as well as in MMP activity; while ASIC1a siRNA blocked these effects. In addition, acid-induced increase in cytosolic levels of phosphorylated IκBα and nuclear levels of phosphorylated p65 in endplate chondrocytes were inhibited by ASIC1a siRNA. ASIC1a is involved in matrix metabolism of endplate chondrocytes under extracellular acidic conditions via NF-κB transcriptional activity.

Abstract: Septins are a major component of the mammalian cytoskeleton. Septins associate with filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubules, but the nature and significance of these interactions are not well understood. Fluorescence microscopy of F-actin- and microtubule-associated septins in fixed and living cells has been instrumental in uncovering septin functions in cellular morphogenesis and cytoskeleton-dependent processes (eg, cell division, cell migration). Here, we provide a detailed methodology for the visualization of endogenous septins by immunofluorescence microscopy, discussing sample preparation and reagents that are critical for optimal staining. In addition, we review approaches for the construction and expression of fluorescent septins and their time-lapse imaging with F-actin and microtubules. The recommended methodology is adaptable for high- and superresolution imaging of mammalian cells with various instrumentation, including wide-field and confocal microscopy as well as total internal reflection fluorescence and structured illumination microscopy.

Abstract: Since their discovery, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute one of the most studied proteins leading to important discoveries and perspectives in terms of their biology and implication in physiology and pathophysiology. This is mostly linked to the remarkable advances in the development and application of the biophysical resonance energy transfer (RET)-based approaches, including bioluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BRET and FRET, respectively). Indeed, BRET and FRET have been extensively applied to study different aspects of GPCR functioning such as their activation and regulation either statically or dynamically, in real-time and intact cells. Consequently, our view on GPCRs has considerably changed opening new challenges for the study of GPCRs in their native tissues in the aim to get more knowledge on how these receptors control the biological responses. Moreover, the technological aspect of this field of research promises further developments for robust and reliable new RET-based assays that may be compatible with high-throughput screening as well as drug discovery programs.

Abstract: The role of microRNA (miRNA) in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) progression has not been studied extensively, especially in retinal pigment epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) which is the main reason for formation of PVR. In this study, we first investigated the miRNA expression profile in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) mediated EMT of ARPE-19 cells. Among the five changed miRNAs, miR-29b showed the most significant downregulation. Enhanced expression of miR-29b could reverse TGF-β1 induced EMT through targeting Akt2. Akt2 downregulation could inhibit TGF-β1-induced EMT. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-29b in ARPE-19 cells directly triggered EMT process, which characterized by the phenotypic transition and the upregulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and downregulation of E-cadherin and zona occludin-1 (ZO-1) with increased cell migration. Akt2-shRNA also inhibited miR-29 inhibitor-induced EMT process. These data indicate that miR-29b plays an important role in TGF-β1-mediated EMT in ARPE-19 cells by targeting Akt2.

Abstract: Progenitor cells in the adult pancreas are potential sources of endocrine beta cells for treating type 1 diabetes. Previously, we identified tri-potent progenitor cells in the adult (2–4month-old) murine pancreas that were capable of self-renewal and differentiation into duct, acinar, and endocrine cells in vitro. These progenitor cells were named pancreatic colony-forming units (PCFUs). However, because PCFUs are a minor population in the pancreas (~1%) they are difficult to study. To enrich PCFUs, strategies using cell-surface marker analyses and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were developed. We found that CD133highCD71low cells, but not other cell populations, enriched PCFUs by up to 30 fold compared to the unsorted cells. CD133highCD71low cells generated primary, secondary, and subsequent colonies when serially re-plated in Matrigel-containing cultures, suggesting self-renewal abilities. In the presence of a laminin hydrogel, CD133highCD71low cells gave rise to colonies that contained duct, acinar, and Insulin+Glucagon+ double-hormonal endocrine cells. Colonies from the laminin hydrogel culture were implanted into diabetic mice, and five weeks later duct, acinar, and Insulin+Glucagon− cells were detected in the grafts, demonstrating tri-lineage differentiation potential of CD133highCD71low cells. These CD133highCD71low cells will enable future studies of putative adult pancreas stem cells in vivo.

Abstract: Cilia are microtubule-based protrusions on the surface of most eukaryotic cells. They are found in most, if not all, vertebrate organs. Prominent cilia form in sensory structures, the eye, the ear, and the nose, where they are crucial for the detection of environmental stimuli, such as light and odors. Cilia are also involved in developmental processes, including left–right asymmetry formation, limb morphogenesis, and the patterning of neurons in the neural tube. Some cilia, such as those found in nephric ducts, are thought to have mechanosensory roles. Zebrafish proved very useful in genetic analysis and imaging of cilia-related processes, and in the modeling of mechanisms behind human cilia abnormalities, known as ciliopathies. A number of zebrafish defects resemble those seen in human ciliopathies. Forward and reverse genetic strategies generated a wide range of cilia mutants in zebrafish, which can be studied using sophisticated genetic and imaging approaches. In this chapter, we provide a set of protocols to examine cilia morphology, motility, and cilia-related defects in a variety of organs, focusing on the embryo and early postembryonic development.

Abstract: Many recent studies have revealed that axin is involved in numerous cellular functions beyond the negative regulation of β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling. Previously, an association of ectopic axin with mitochondria was observed. In an effort to investigate the relationship between axin and mitochondria, we found that axin expression suppressed cellular ATP production, which was more apparent as axin expression levels increased. Also, mitochondrial expression of axin was observed using two axin-expressing HeLa cell models: doxycycline-inducible ectopic axin expression (HeLa-axin) and axin expression enhanced by long-term treatment with XAV939 (HeLa-XAV). In biochemical analysis, axin is associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex IV and is involved in defects in the assembly of complex IV-containing supercomplexes. Functionally, axin expression reduced the activity of OXPHOS complex IV and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), suggesting axin-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Subsequent studies using various inhibitors of Wnt signaling showed that the reduction in cellular ATP levels was weaker in cases of ICAT protein expression and treatment with iCRT3 or NSC668036 compared with XAV939 treatment, suggesting that XAV939 treatment affects ATP synthesis in addition to suppressing Wnt signaling activity. Axin-mediated regulation of mitochondrial function may be an additional mechanism to Wnt signaling for regulation of cell growth.

Abstract: The endoderm is the innermost embryonic germ layer, and in zebrafish, it gives rise to the lining of the gut, the gills, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and derivatives of the pharyngeal pouch. These organs form the gastrointestinal tract and are involved with the absorption, delivery, and metabolism of nutrients. The liver has a central role in regulating these processes because it controls carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, and breakdown of endogenous and xenobiotic products. Liver dysfunction frequently leads to significant morbidity and mortality; however, in most settings of organ injury, the liver exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity. In this chapter, we review the principal mechanisms of endoderm and liver formation and provide protocols to assess liver formation and liver regeneration.

Abstract: Reversible covalent histone modifications are known to influence spatiotemporal patterns of gene transcription during development. Here I review recent advances in the development and use of methods to analyze the distribution and functions of histone modifications in zebrafish chromatin. I discuss the roles of dynamic histone modification patterns at the promoters and enhancers of genes during the process of zygotic gene activation at blastula stages and the interplay between the molecular machinery responsible for histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 and co-receptor BAK1 perceive the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate plant immunity. To prevent this response, phytopathogenic bacteria deploy a repertoire of effector proteins to perturb immune signaling. However, the effector-induced perturbation is often sensed by the host, triggering another layer of immunity. We report that the Pseudomonas syringae effector HopB1 acts as a protease to cleave immune-activated BAK1. Prior to activation, HopB1 constitutively interacts with FLS2. Upon activation by flg22, BAK1 is recruited to the FLS2-HopB1 complex and is phosphorylated at Thr455. HopB1 then specifically cleaves BAK1 between Arg297 and Gly298 to inhibit FLS2 signaling. Although perturbation of BAK1 is known to trigger increased immune responses in plants, the HopB1-mediated cleavage of BAK1 leads to enhanced virulence, but not disease resistance. This study thus reveals a virulence strategy by which a pathogen effector attacks the plant immune system with minimal host perturbation.

Abstract: Summary
The Diels-Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction is one of the most powerful and elegant organic synthesis methods for forming 6-membered molecules and has been known for nearly a century. However, whether and how enzymes catalyze this type of reaction is still not completely clear. Here we focus on PyrI4, an enzyme found in the biosynthetic pathway of pyrroindomycins where it catalyzes the formation of a spiro-conjugate via an enzyme-dependent exo-selective [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. We report the crystal structures of PyrI4 alone and in complex with its product. Comparative analysis of these structures, combined with biochemical analysis, lead us to propose a unique trapping mechanism whereby the lid-like action of the N-terminal tail imposes conformational constraints on the β barrel catalytic core, which enhances the proximity and polarization effects of reactive groups (1,3-diene and alkene) to drive cyclization in a regio- and stereo-specific manner. This work represents an important step toward the wider application of enzyme-catalyzed [4 + 2] cyclization for synthetic purposes.

Abstract: During physical activity, increased reactive oxygen species production occurs, which can lead to cell damage and in a decline of individual’s performance and health. The use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as a supplement to protect the immune system has been increasing; however, their possible benefit to the anti-oxidant system is not well described. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) can be beneficial to the anti-oxidant system in cultured skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 myocytes were differentiated and treated with either eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid for 24 h. Superoxide content was quantified using the dihydroethidine oxidation method and superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity, and expression was quantified. We observed that the docosahexaenoic fatty acids caused an increase in superoxide production. Eicosapentaenoic acid induced catalase activity, while docosahexaenoic acid suppressed superoxide dismutase activity. In addition, we found an increased protein expression of the total manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes when cells were treated with eicosapentaenoic acid. Taken together, these data indicate that the use of eicosapentaenoic acid may present both acute and chronic benefits; however, the treatment with DHA may not be beneficial to muscle cells.

Abstract: Summary
Surface-associated TRAP (thrombospondin-related anonymous protein) family proteins are conserved across the phylum of apicomplexan parasites. TRAP proteins are thought to play an integral role in parasite motility and cell invasion by linking the extracellular environment with the parasite submembrane actomyosin motor. Blood stage forms of the malaria parasite Plasmodium express a TRAP family protein called merozoite-TRAP (MTRAP) that has been implicated in erythrocyte invasion. Using MTRAP-deficient mutants of the rodent-infecting P. berghei and human-infecting P. falciparum parasites, we show that MTRAP is dispensable for erythrocyte invasion. Instead, MTRAP is essential for gamete egress from erythrocytes, where it is necessary for the disruption of the gamete-containing parasitophorous vacuole membrane, and thus for parasite transmission to mosquitoes. This indicates that motor-binding TRAP family members function not just in parasite motility and cell invasion but also in membrane disruption and cell egress.

Abstract: Summary
Whole-cell cancer vaccines are a promising strategy for treating cancer, but the characteristics of a favorable immune response are not fully understood. New insights could enable development of better vaccines, discovery of new antigens, and identification of biomarkers of efficacy. Using glyco-antigen microarrays, we demonstrate that GVAX Pancreas (a granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-modified whole-cell tumor vaccine) induces large immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M responses to many antigens, including tumor-associated carbohydrates, blood group antigens, α-Gal, and bovine fetuin. Antibody responses to α-Gal, a glycan found in fetal bovine serum (FBS) used to produce the vaccine, correlated inversely with overall survival and appear to compete with productive responses to the vaccine. H1299 lysate vaccine, produced with FBS, also induced responses to α-Gal and fetuin but not K562-GM, which is produced in serum-free medium. Our results provide new potential biomarkers to evaluate productive/unproductive immune responses and suggest that removal/reduction of FBS could improve the efficacy of whole-cell vaccines.

Abstract: Modification of proteins with small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO; SUMOylation) is involved in the regulation of various biological processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that noncovalent associations between SUMOylated proteins and co-operative proteins containing SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) are important for the spatiotemporal organization of many protein complexes. In this study, we demonstrate that interactions between lamin A, a major component of the nuclear lamina, and SUMO isoforms are dependent on one of the four SIMs (SIM3) resided in lamin A polypeptide in vitro. Live cell imaging and immunofluorescence staining showed that SIM3 is required for accumulation of lamin A on the chromosomes during telophase, and subsequent evaluation of a panel of deletion mutants determined that a 156-amino acid region spanning the carboxyl-terminal Ig-fold domain of lamin A is sufficient for this accumulation. Notably, mutation of SIM3 abrogated the dephosphorylation of mitosis-specific phosphorylation at Ser-22 of lamin A, which normally occurs during telophase, and the subsequent nuclear lamina reorganization. Furthermore, expression of a conjugation-defective SUMO2 mutant, which was previously shown to inhibit endogenous SUMOylation in a dominant-negative manner, also impaired the accumulation of wild type lamin A on telophase chromosomes. These findings suggest that interactions between SIM3 of lamin A and a putative SUMO2-modified protein plays an important role in the reorganization of the nuclear lamina at the end of mitosis.

Abstract: Despite great progress for two decades in microRNAs (miRNAs), the direct regulation of host gene by intragenic (mostly intronic) miRNA is conceptually plausible but evidence-limited. Here, we report that intronic miR-932 could target its host gene via binding with coding sequence (CDS) region rather than regular 3’UTR. The conserved miR-932 is embedded in the fourth intron of Drosophila neuroligin2 (dnlg2), which encodes a synaptic cell adhesion molecule, DNlg2. In silico analysis predicted two putative miR-932 target sites locate in the CDS region of dnlg2 instead of regular 3’-UTR miRNA binding sites. Employing luciferase reporter assay, we further proved that the miR-932 regulates expression of its host gene dnlg2 via the binding CDS region of dnlg2. Consistently, we observed miR-932 downregulated expression of dnlg2 in S2 cell, and the repression of dnlg2 by miR-932 at both protein and RNA level. Furthermore, we found CDS-located site1 is dominant for regulating expression of host dnlg2 by miR-932. In addition to providing thorough examination of one intronic miRNA targeting the CDS region of its host gene, our genome-wide analysis indicated that nearly half of fruitfly and human intronic miRNAs may target their own host gene at coding region. This study would be valuable in elucidating the regulation of intronic miRNA on host gene, and provide new information about the biological context of their genomic arrangements and functions.

Abstract: Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy allows probing the cellular events occurring close and at the plasma membrane. Over the last decade, we have seen a significant increase in the number of publications applying TIRF microscopy to unravel some of the fundamental biological questions regarding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) function such as the mechanisms controlling receptor trafficking, quaternary structure, and signaling among others. Most of the published work has been performed in heterologous systems such as HEK293 and CHO cells, where the imaging surface available is higher and smoother when compared with the narrow processes or the smaller cell bodies of neurons. However, some publications have expanded our understanding of these events to primary cell cultures, mostly rat hippocampal and striatal neuronal cultures. Results from these cells provide a bona fide model of the complex events controlling GPCR function in living cells. We believe more work needs to be performed in primary cultures and eventually in intact tissue to complement the knowledge obtained from heterologous cell models. Here, we described a step-by-step protocol to investigate the surface trafficking and signaling from GPCRs in rat hippocampal and striatal primary cultures.

Abstract: The general mechanism underlying the tumor suppressor activity of the Hippo signaling pathway remains unclear. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanisms connecting the Hippo signaling pathway with glucose metabolism. We have found that two key regulators of glycolysis, C-MYC and GLUT1, are targets of the Hippo signaling pathway in human leukemia cells. Our results revealed that activation of MST1 by the natural compound shikonin inhibited the expression of GLUT1 and C-MYC. Furthermore, RNAi experiments confirmed the regulation of GLUT1 and C-MYC expression via the MST1-YAP1-TEAD1 axis. Surprisingly, YAP1 was found to positively regulate C-MYC mRNA levels in complex with TEAD1, while it negatively regulates C-MYC levels in cooperation with MST1. Hence, YAP1 serves as a rheostat for C-MYC, which is regulated by MST1. In addition, depletion of MST1 stimulates lactate production, whereas the specific depletion of TEAD1 has an opposite effect. The inhibition of lactate production and cellular proliferation induced by shikonin also depends on the Hippo pathway activity. Finally, a bioinformatic analysis revealed conserved TEAD-binding motifs in the C-MYC and GLUT1 promoters providing another molecular data supporting our observations. In summary, regulation of glucose metabolism could serve as a new tumor suppressor mechanism orchestrated by the Hippo signaling pathway.

Abstract: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the major disorders of the urinary system in elderly men. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the main component of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and has nerve protective, anti-inflammatory and tumour-growth inhibitory effects. Here, the therapeutic potential of DHA in treating BPH was investigated. Seal oil effectively prevented the development of prostatic hyperplasia induced by oestradiol/testosterone in a rat model by suppressing the increase of the prostatic index (PI), reducing the thickness of the peri-glandular smooth muscle layer, inhibiting the proliferation of both prostate epithelial and stromal cells, and downregulating the expression of androgen receptor (AR) and oestrogen receptor α (ERα). An in vitro study showed that DHA inhibited the growth of the human prostate stromal cell line WPMY-1 and the epithelial cell line RWPE-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In both cell lines, the DHA arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase. In addition, DHA also reduced the expression of ERα and AR in the WPMY-1 and RWPE-1 cells. These results indicate that DHA inhibits the multiplication of prostate stromal and epithelial cells through a mechanism that may involve cell cycle arrest and the downregulation of ERα and AR expression.

Abstract: Zebrafish embryonic cell cultures have many useful properties that make them complementary to intact embryos for a wide range of studies. Embryonic cell cultures allow for maintenance of transient cell populations, control of chemical and mechanical cues received by cells, and facile chemical screening. Zebrafish cells can be cultured in either heterogeneous or homogeneous cultures from a wide range of developmental time points. Here we describe two methods with particular applicability to chemical screening: a method for the culture of blastomeres for directed differentiation toward the myogenic lineage and a method for the culture of neural crest cells in heterogeneous cultures from early somitogenesis embryos.

Abstract: The vertebrate pancreas is composed of acinar tissue that produces digestive enzymes, a ductal system for transporting those enzymes, and the endocrine islets which produce hormones critical for organism glucose homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted similarities between zebrafish and mammals in organ development, and increasingly reveal that the regulation of metabolic homeostasis is highly conserved as well. Use of zebrafish as a model organism, with its ease of genetic manipulation, high fecundity, and ready access for imaging, has been highly productive for studies of islet cell development. We review the most recent progress in our understanding of how the later forming endocrine cells develop from duct-associated progenitors and new tools available for these studies. We also discuss current approaches and technological advances for addressing beta cell physiology, organism glucose homeostasis, and associated processes within zebrafish. Finally, we describe emerging methods being used to establish new zebrafish models of diabetes and related pathologies, to expand the use of this model organism to discover new therapies and to facilitate studies of disease pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in a form of noncanonical autophagy, known as LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), lead to increased inflammatory pathology during fungal infection. Although LAP contributes to fungal degradation, the molecular mechanisms underlying LAP-mediated modulation of inflammation are unknown. We describe a mechanism by which inflammation is regulated during LAP through the death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1). The ATF6/C/EBP-β/DAPK1 axis activated by IFN-γ not only mediates LAP to Aspergillus fumigatus but also concomitantly inhibits Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) activation and restrains pathogenic inflammation. In mouse models and patient samples of chronic granulomatous disease, which exhibit defective autophagy and increased inflammasome activity, IFN-γ restores reduced DAPK1 activity and dampens fungal growth. Additionally, in a cohort of hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted patients, a genetic DAPK1 deficiency is associated with increased inflammation and heightened aspergillosis susceptibility. Thus, DAPK1 is a potential drugable player in regulating the inflammatory response during fungal clearance initiated by IFN-γ.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are capable of unlimited self-renewal and can generate nearly all cells in the body. Changes induced by different LSD1 activities on the regulation of hiPSC self-renewal and differentiation and the mechanism underlying such changes were determined. We used two different LSD1 inhibitors (phenelzine sulfate and tranylcypromine) and RNAi technique to inhibit LSD1 activity, and we obtained hiPSCs showing 71.3%, 53.28%, and 31.33% of the LSD1 activity in normal hiPSCs. The cells still maintained satisfactory self-renewal capacity when LSD1 activity was at 71.3%. The growth rate of hiPSCs decreased and cells differentiated when LSD1 activity was at approximately 53.28%. The hiPSCs were mainly arrested in the G0/G1 phase and simultaneously differentiated into endodermal tissue when LSD1 activity was at 31.33%. Teratoma experiments showed that the downregulation of LSD1 resulted in low teratoma volume. When LSD1 activity was below 50%, pluripotency of hiPSCs was impaired, and the teratomas mainly comprised endodermal and mesodermal tissues. This phenomenon was achieved by regulating the critical balance between histone methylation and demethylation at regulatory regions of several key pluripotent and developmental genes.

Abstract: Summary
Highly pathogenic human respiratory coronaviruses cause acute lethal disease characterized by exuberant inflammatory responses and lung damage. However, the factors leading to lung pathology are not well understood. Using mice infected with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV, we show that robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling orchestrates inflammatory responses and lung immunopathology with diminished survival. IFN-I remains detectable until after virus titers peak, but early IFN-I administration ameliorates immunopathology. This delayed IFN-I signaling promotes the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs), resulting in elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage, and impaired virus-specific T cell responses. Genetic ablation of the IFN-αβ receptor (IFNAR) or IMM depletion protects mice from lethal infection, without affecting viral load. These results demonstrate that IFN-I and IMM promote lethal SARS-CoV infection and identify IFN-I and IMMs as potential therapeutic targets in patients infected with pathogenic coronavirus and perhaps other respiratory viruses.
