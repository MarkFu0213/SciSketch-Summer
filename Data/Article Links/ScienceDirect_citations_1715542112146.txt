Abstract: Rab3D belongs to Rab protein family. Previous reports showed that the expression of Rab3D was dysregulated in various types of cancer. Rab3D belongsRab3D belongs. However, little is known about the role of Rab3D in carcinogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we first evaluated the expression of Rab3D in 32 fresh CRC and matched normal tissues and found Rab3D was dramatically increased in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues (p<0.001). Furthermore, immunochemistry was used to investigate Rab3D expression in 300CRC tissue specimens. The expression of Rab3D significantly positively correlated with the tumor size (p=0.041), CEA level (p=0.007), tumor classification (p=0.030), lymphatic metastasis (p<0.001), distant metastasis (p=0.013) and clinical stage (p=0.003). We also demonstrated that overall survival is poor in CRC patients with high expression of Rab3D (p<0.001). Finally, we showed that Rab3D activated Akt/GSK3β/Snail pathway and induced EMT process in colorectal cancer cells. In conclusion, this study establishes increased Rab3D expression is associated with invasiveness of CRC cells, and Rab3D expression status may serve as a reliable prognostic biomarker in CRC patients.

Abstract: TiO2 nanobelts/MoO3 nanosheets (TM) heterostructure composites have been synthesized via an in-situ growth method in which the TiO2–MoS2 was used as precursor. The whole fabrication process involved the preparation of MoS2 nanoparticles modified TiO2 nanobelts (TiO2 Nbs) and subsequently transformation of the MoS2 to MoO3 nanosheets. The properties of TM were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, EDX, DRS, FT-IR, XPS and PL, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of TM was evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (Rh B) aqueous solution under simulated sunlight irradiation and its photoabsorption energy (PE, the energy required to excite valence band electrons of TiO2 nanobelts to conduction band states of MoO3 nanosheets (MoO3)) properties are related to the physical and chemical interaction between TiO2 Nbs and MoO3. The experimental results showed that TM exhibited a much better photocatalytic activity than that of pure TiO2, and showed an excellent recyclability property for its photocatalytic applications.

Abstract: We have investigated the impact of carbon co-doping on the performance of boron–doped Czochralski-grown silicon solar cells. It is found that carbon co-doping will deteriorate the initial performance of Aluminium-back-surface-field solar cells before light-induced degradation (LID), owing to the enhancement effect on the formation of oxygen precipitation. However, carbon co-doping can effectively suppress the formation of boron-oxygen complexes in the solar cells, which becomes more significant with an increase of the carbon concentration. Therefore, the performance of carbon co-doped silicon solar cells is better than that of conventional silicon solar cells after LID. All these results are of great significance for the practical application of carbon co-doped silicon solar cells with low LID effect in photovoltaic industry.

Abstract: A simple and inexpensive solution process has been developed to construct a silver film with enhanced adhesion by electroless plating for solar reflector applications. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were employed to characterize the surfaces. This reinforced adhesion is due to chemical covalent bonds between silver and substrate atoms. Silver maintains its unique conductivity even as a film on the ABS surface as demonstrated by four-point probe measurement. Moreover, UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer data confirms high reflectance of the Ag films in the infrared region indicating potential application for solar coatings. The method presented a convenient, compatible, and easily scalable manufacturing process with higher efficiency, which is of significant value for industrial fabrication of silver films and could have a promising future in concentrating solar systems.

Abstract: LukS-PV, a component of Panton–Valentine leukocidin, is a pore-forming cytotoxin secreted by Staphylococcus aureus. Here we examined the potential effect of LukS-PV in differentiation of human leukemia cells and the underlying mechanism. We found that LukS-PV could induce differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, including AML cell lines and primary AML blasts, as determined by morphological changes, phagocytosis assay and expression of CD14 and CD11b surface antigens. In addition, LukS-PV activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of c-JUN and c-FOS transcriptional factors in the process of differentiation. Inhibiting ERK pathway activation with U0126 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor) markedly blocked LukS-PV-induced differentiation and decreased the phosphorylation of c-JUN and c-FOS. These findings demonstrate an essential role for the ERK pathway together with c-JUN and c-FOS in the differentiation activity of LukS-PV. Taken together, our data suggest that LukS-PV could be a potential candidate as a differentiation-inducing agent for the therapeutic treatment of AML.

Abstract: We introduce efficient planar heterojunction CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated with a roller coating process under ambient conditions. The perovskite films were prepared with a roller coating of lead iodide (PbI2) and a spin coating of methylammonium iodide (MAI), a successive roller coating of PbI2 and MAI, and a spin coating of PbI2 and MAI as a reference film. The PSCs with roller-coated perovskite films were systemically compared to a reference PSC with spin-coated PbI2 and MAI. In order to investigate the effect of roller coating on PSC performance, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–vis absorption, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed. With the PbI2 roller coating, the PSCs showed excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 9.52% under a standard 1-sun condition, quite comparable to the spin-coated PSCs. In addition, the PSCs with the all roller-coated PbI2 and MAI showed high PCEs of up to 6.421%, and with the aid of an additive the PCEs were further enhanced of up to 7.356%. These results support the conclusion that roller coating can be used for the facile and cost-effective manufacture of high-efficiency solution-based PSCs.

Abstract: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in tumor progression and metastasis as a crucial event for cancer cells to trigger the metastatic niche. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been shown to play an important role as an EMT inducer in various stages of carcinogenesis. Previous reports had shown that antitumor vanadium inhibits the metastatic potential of tumor cells by reducing MMP-2 expression and inducing ROS-dependent apoptosis. However, the role of vanadium in (TGF-β)-induced EMT remains unclear. In the present study, we report for the first time on the inhibitory effects of vanadium on (TGF-β)-mediated EMT followed by down-regulation of ex vivo cancer stem cell markers. The results demonstrate blockage of (TGF-β)-mediated EMT by vanadium and reduction in the mitochondrial potential of tumor cells linked to EMT and cancer metabolism. Furthermore, combination of vanadium and carboplatin (a) resulted in synergistic antitumor activity in ex vivo cell cultures, and (b) prompted G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and sensitization of tumor cells to carboplatin-induced apoptosis. Overall, the findings highlight the multifaceted antitumor action of vanadium and its synergistic antitumor efficacy with current chemotherapy drugs, knowledge that could be valuable for targeting cancer cell metabolism and cancer stem cell-mediated metastasis in aggressive chemoresistant tumors.

Abstract: The photoelectrochemical performance of naturally occurring single and multicrystalline Kesterite or Cu2(Zn,Fe)SnS4 (CZTS) is presented. Elemental analyses of the crystals indicate high sulfur to metal atomic ratios and the presence of 12.3–14.5at% of iron presumably in the 2+ metal site replacing zinc in the lattice. Raman spectroscopy indicates the possible presence of a Cu2SnS3 impurity phase. Photocurrent spectroscopy measurements give a bandgap of 1.61–1.63eV, higher than most reported values for pure Cu2ZnSnS4 films. Mott–Schottky measurements show that these crystals have a high doping density of about 1019cm−3, that reduces to about 1017cm−3 after a brief etch in 10% KCN (aq.) solution. Although still low, the carrier diffusion length is increased by the removal of surface defects. This work demonstrates the ability to simply and easily evaluate the photovoltaic potential for a plethora of naturally occurring semiconducting materials.

Abstract: Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) is a vascular disease of proven genetic origin, which may arise sporadically or is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and highly variable expressivity. CCM lesions exhibit a range of different phenotypes, including wide inter-individual differences in lesion number, size, and susceptibility to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Lesions may remain asymptomatic or result in pathological conditions of various type and severity at any age, with symptoms ranging from recurrent headaches to severe neurological deficits, seizures, and stroke. To date there are no direct therapeutic approaches for CCM disease besides the surgical removal of accessible lesions. Novel pharmacological strategies are particularly needed to limit disease progression and severity and prevent de novo formation of CCM lesions in susceptible individuals. Useful insights into innovative approaches for CCM disease prevention and treatment are emerging from a growing understanding of the biological functions of the three known CCM proteins, CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2 and CCM3/PDCD10. In particular, accumulating evidence indicates that these proteins play major roles in distinct signaling pathways, including those involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress, inflammation and angiogenesis, pointing to pathophysiological mechanisms whereby the function of CCM proteins may be relevant in preventing vascular dysfunctions triggered by these events. Indeed, emerging findings demonstrate that the pleiotropic roles of CCM proteins reflect their critical capacity to modulate the fine-tuned crosstalk between redox signaling and autophagy that govern cell homeostasis and stress responses, providing a novel mechanistic scenario that reconciles both the multiple signaling pathways linked to CCM proteins and the distinct therapeutic approaches proposed so far. In addition, recent studies in CCM patient cohorts suggest that genetic susceptibility factors related to differences in vascular sensitivity to oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to inter-individual differences in CCM disease susceptibility and severity. This review discusses recent progress into the understanding of the molecular basis and mechanisms of CCM disease pathogenesis, with specific emphasis on the potential contribution of altered cell responses to oxidative stress and inflammatory events occurring locally in the microvascular environment, and consequent implications for the development of novel, safe, and effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, the optical and thermophysical properties of CuO nanofluid as the working fluid of low temperature direct absorption solar collector which is prepared by dispersing the CuO nanoparticles into mixture of distilled water and ethylene glycol (70%:30% in volume) as the base fluid is investigated at the different temperatures for different volume fractions. The results showed that the nanofluids had higher absorption coefficient compared to the base fluid in the whole wavelengths for solar energy, ranging from 200 to 2500nm. The absorbed energy fraction of CuO nanofluid with only 100ppm (volume fraction 0.01%) nanoparticle volume fraction is 4 times more than that of the base fluid at solar collector depth of 1cm. The viscosity increased with the increasing volume fraction and decreased exponentially with the increasing temperature. The thermal conductivity of CuO nanofluids increased with the increase of CuO volume fraction in the base fluid and temperature. At the investigated volume fractions, the thermal conductivity of the nanofluids was found to increase with respect to the base fluid up to about 13.7% for the 100ppm CuO nanoparticle volume fraction. Higher thermal conductivity and lower viscosity of CuO nanofluids by increasing temperature, together with the appropriate optical properties, introduce this kind of nanofluids as an appropriate candidate to effectively enhance the direct absorption solar collector efficiency.

Abstract: Background
Achieving a high rate of complete pathological response with pre-operative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer is an unmet need. We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of cetuximab, capecitabine and radiation therapy in the pre-operative setting of localized rectal cancer.
Patients and methods
Patients with clinically staged T3, T4 or nodepositive rectal cancer were treated with concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy with weekly cetuximab starting one week before the start of radiation. This was followed by total mesorectal excision within 6-8 weeks. All patients achieving R0 resection received adjuvant capecitabine for 6 cycles.
Results
Fifteen patients were treated and all underwent surgery. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 11 patients (73.3%) and pathological complete response in two. With a median follow up of 48 months (range 8.4-57.5), 12 patients were relapse-free and 14 were alive with 4-year relapse free survival of 80%. Overall survival was 93%. Significant grade 3 and 4 toxicity was mainly cetuximab-induced skin reactions (33%), radiation-induced skin toxicity (13%) and diarrhea (20%).
Conclusions
Adding cetuximab to pre-operative concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy provides modest efficacy with manageable toxicity.

Abstract: Background/objective
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis (MPN-MF). The main clinical manifestation of MPN-MF is splenomegaly secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). The effects of HSCT on splenic EMH and associated vascular and stromal changes are unknown. This study compares the findings seen in spleens following HSCT with those of nontransplanted patients, normal controls, and matched bone marrow (BM) samples.
Methods
This study included three transplanted MPN-MF spleens, three nontransplanted MPN-MF spleens, and three normal controls. Spleens were assessed for: (a) presence/extent of EMH; (b) presence of Gamna–Gandy bodies; (c) splenic fibrosis; (d) CD34-positive microvessel density; (e) CD8-positive sinusoids; (f) frequency of smooth muscle actin-positive myoid cells; and (g) nerve growth factor receptor-positive adventitial reticulum cells. In two cases, matched BM samples were assessed for cellularity, presence of atypical megakaryocytes, and fibrosis.
Results
Compared with normal controls, all MPN-MF spleens were larger in size, had EMH, red pulp fibrosis, higher CD34-positive microvessel density, and decreased CD8-positive sinusoids. Compared with nontransplanted cases, post-HSCT spleens showed disappearance or reduction of EMH. Gamna–Gandy bodies were increased; no differences in the remaining parameters were found. A reduction of splenic EMH was associated with normalization of BM cellularity and megakaryopoiesis.
Conclusion
HSCT reduces/abrogates splenic EMH and is associated with an increased number of Gamna–Gandy bodies, which may suggest vascular damage. The lack of stromal changes in spleens removed shortly after transplant is in line with similar observations in the BM, where a longer interval is often necessary for resolution of fibrosis.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) system decision making techniques have traditionally been based on a single economic criterion. However, to properly address global and regional targets for green energy economy, it is necessary to consider a myriad of criteria including environmental implications. A global range of existing or emerging financial support policies should be considered, presenting a complex mathematical problem across several stakeholders to decide where, what and when to invest. This paper presents a multi-criteria framework to evaluate the impact of different financial support policies on their attractiveness for domestic PV systems deployment on a multinational level. The paper also reviews historic cumulative PV installation under certain studied financial policies, and brings the framework output into this discussion related to evident effectiveness of these policies. The paper highlights the policies that have the potential to encourage rapid deployment of PV systems which in turn may facilitate sufficient investments to several stakeholders.

Abstract: Lifecycle impacts of photovoltaic (PV) plants have been largely explored in several studies. However, the end-of-life phase has been generally excluded or neglected from these analyses, mainly because of the low amount of panels that reached the disposal yet and the lack of data about their end of life. It is expected that the disposal of PV panels will become a relevant environmental issue in the next decades. This article illustrates and analyses an innovative process for the recycling of silicon PV panel. The process is based on a sequence of physical (mechanical and thermal) treatments followed by acid leaching and electrolysis. The Life Cycle Assessment methodology has been applied to account for the environmental impacts of the process. Environmental benefits (i.e. credits) due to the potential productions of secondary raw materials have been intentionally excluded, as the focus is on the recycling process. The article provides transparent and disaggregated information on the end-of-life stage of silicon PV panel, which could be useful for other LCA practitioners for future assessment of PV technologies. The study highlights that the impacts are concentrated on the incineration of the panel׳s encapsulation layers, followed by the treatments to recover silicon metal, silver, copper, aluminium. For example around 20% of the global warming potential impact is due to the incineration of the sandwich layer and 30% to the post-incineration treatments. Transport is also relevant for several impact categories, ranging from a minimum of about 10% (for the freshwater eutrophication) up to 80% (for the Abiotic Depletion Potential – minerals).

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from various animals undergo a spontaneous transformation in long-term culture. The transformed MSCs are highly tumorigenic and are likely to be the tumor-initiating cells of sarcoma. To explain why the transformed MSCs become tumorigenic, the present study investigated the characteristics of rat MSCs before and after spontaneous transformation. It was shown that although the transformed MSCs maintained typical surface markers of MSC, they exhibited some cancer stem cell-like characteristics such as loss of contact inhibition and multi-potency to mesenchymal lineages, and acquirement of ability of anchorage-independent growth. The expression of a key senescence regulator p16 almost disappeared, but the other one, p53 abnormally increased in the transformed MSCs. ChIP assay demonstrated that a normal negative regulation of p53 on survivin gene disappeared in the transformed cells due to a lack of p53 binding to the promoter of survivin gene. DNA sequencing revealed that the p53 gene in transformed MSCs was not a wild-type, but a 942C>T mutant with the mutation located in the sequence coding p53 protein’s DNA-binding domain. These findings indicate that the transformed MSCs express high levels of a p53 mutant that loses the ability to bind survivin gene, leading to an abnormally upregulated expression of survivin, which is a key reason for the cell’s unlimited proliferation.

Abstract: Post-deposition annealing (PDA) of chalcogenide-based solar cells has shown to enhance optoelectronic properties, though the mechanism for such improvement is still poorly understood. In this work Cu2ZnSnSe4 kesterite-based solar cells are fabricated and subjected to different PDA temperatures in order to study the structure/function relationships and explain the responsible mechanisms. Diffusion and recrystallization phenomena at the absorber/buffer interface during the PDA are investigated using multiwavelength Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence, and correlated to the optoelectronic properties. By using varying laser excitations (442, 532, 785nm), the selective acquisition of structural information at different depths is obtained, thus providing insights of the differences in the composition and defect concentration in the device cross section. The results show that PDA treatments of completed devices induce a redistribution of atoms (Cu and Zn) within the surface and sub-surface of the absorber layer. The absorber surface becomes more Cu-depleted and Zn-enriched, creating optoelectronically beneficial defects VCu and ZnCu, which are partly responsible for the performance improvement. Recrystallization effects of the CdS layer are observed, leading to a better absorber-buffer interface and potentially a better band alignment. Additionally, this work opens the possibility of tuning the defect concentration in the absorber with the PDA temperature.

Abstract: The β-like globin genes are developmental stage specifically transcribed in erythroid cells. The transcription of the β-like globin genes requires erythroid specific activators such as GATA-1, NF-E2, TAL1 and KLF1. However, the roles of these activators have not fully elucidated in transcription of the human adult β-globin gene. Here we employed hybrid MEL cells (MEL/ch11) where a human chromosome containing the β-globin locus is present and the adult β-globin gene is highly transcribed by induction. The roles of erythroid specific activators were analyzed by inhibiting the expression of NF-E2, TAL1 or KLF1 in MEL/ch11 cells. The loss of each activator decreased the transcription of human β-globin gene, locus wide histone hyperacetylation and the binding of other erythroid specific activators including GATA-1, even though not affecting the expression of other activators. Notably, sensitivity to DNase I was reduced in the locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive sites (HSs) with the depletion of activators. These results indicate that NF-E2, TAL1 and KLF1, all activators play a primary role in HSs formation in the LCR. It might contribute to the transcription of human adult β-globin gene by allowing the access of activators and cofactors. The roles of activators in the adult β-globin locus appear to be different from the roles in the early fetal locus.

Abstract: Volumetric absorption, which requires media with good optical and thermal properties, is a promising technology for solar collectors. An advanced composite core/shell nanostructure, which can be used for the integration of sunlight harvest and energy storage, is reported in this paper. The composite core/shell nanoparticles are composed by Sn, SiO2 and Ag. Sn material is used for thermal energy storage through phase change, and SiO2 provides containment. Ag shell can improve light absorption of nanoparticles due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. Compared with pure nanoparticles, the Sn/SiO2/Ag composite nanoparticles have good abilities of both optical absorption and thermal energy storage, which can improve the performance of volumetric absorption solar collectors at medium to high temperature.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluated the colloidal stability of gold nanorods (with positive, negative and neutral surface charge) in solution upon contact with excised human skin. UV–vis absorption, plasmon peak broadening index (PPBI%) and transmission electron microscope analysis were used to follow nanoparticles aggregation in solution. Our results show that positively charged gold nanorods aggregate extensively upon exposure to excised human skin compared to negatively and neutrally charged gold nanorods. Skin-induced aggregation of cationic gold nanorods was linked to the adsorption of proteins released from the dermis layer to the surface of gold nanorods. Protein adsorption significantly screen nanorod’s effective surface charge and induce their aggregation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presence of polyethylene glycol polymer on the surface of cationic gold nanorods minimize this aggregation significantly by providing steric repulsion (non-electrostatic stabilization mechanism). This work highlights the importance of evaluating the colloidal stability of nanoparticles in solution upon contact with skin, which is a “usually overlooked” parameter when studying the nanoparticle-skin interaction.

Abstract: We investigate the Ga0.47In0.53As to InP interface with respect to their charge carrier lifetimes, interface recombination velocity and lateral interface homogeneity by using a time- and spatially resolved photoluminescence technique. Different preparation routes, such as group-III- and group-V-rich variations for the upper Ga0.47In0.53As to InP interface, which is basic for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, are presented for a series of so-called double heterostructures with different absorber thickness. For chosen interface preparation routes the bulk lifetime and interface recombination velocity at a fixed excitation density are extracted. Overall low interface recombination velocities occur, while one group-III-rich preparation route with an enhanced lateral homogeneity results in higher lifetimes at all excitation densities compared to the sophisticated group-V-rich preparation.

Abstract: Unlike conventional multi-wire sawn (CMWS) multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers, diamond wire sawn (DWS) mc-Si wafers textured by conventional acidic solution of HF/HNO3 are not suitable for solar cells because visible saw marks set significant barriers in both cell performance and surface appearance. In this work, we have employed versatile strategies based on metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) technique to eliminate the saw marks and realize effective surface textures on DWS mc-Si wafers, including nano-texture (N-T), micro-texture (M-T) and nano/micro-texture (N/M-T). Especially, benefiting from the tradeoff between optical gain and electrical loss, the efficiency of 18.45% for N/M-T based DWS mc-Si solar cells with a standard wafer size of 156×156mm2 is reported to be higher by an absolute 0.57% compared with that of CMWS mc-Si solar cells (17.88%). Our work provides ways of fabricating DWS mc-Si solar cells with high efficiencies and satisfactory visual appearance.

Abstract: Embedded CdS nanowires are used for improving the spectral transmission of the CdS window layer, thus enhancing the quantum efficiency of CdS–CdTe solar cells. Substantially higher light transmission is observed in the 300nm–550nm wavelength range. A nearly ideal spectral response of quantum efficiency over a wide spectral range provides evidence for improved light transmission through the window layer and enhanced absorption and carrier generation in the CdTe absorber layer. Nanowire CdS/CdTe solar cells on SnO2/ITO-soda lime glass substrates, and with Cu/graphite paste/silver paste as back contact electrodes, yield a power conversion efficiency of 12%. MoO3−x /Au back contacts were also investigated. With these back contacts, the nanowire CdS–CdTe solar cells exhibit efficiency comparable to the efficiency of their planar CdS counterparts. Junction transport mechanisms are delineated for advancing the basic understanding of device physics at the interface. Our results prove the efficacy of this nanowire approach for enhancing the quantum efficiency in window-absorber type solar cells (CdS–CdTe, CdS–CIGS and CdS–CZTSSe etc.) and other optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Presently existing screening approaches for lung cancer are not being proving sufficient and sensitive, so a study was conducted to identify disease related biomarker proteins for diagnostic applications. A total of 100 lung cancer patients (88 non-small cell lung cancer and 12 small cell lung cancer) and 50 healthy controls were included in this study. Serum samples of patients and healthy controls were subjected to a series of proteomic approaches and as a result of two dimensional gel electrophoresis, a ∼43kDa protein was found to be differentially expressed compared to healthy controls. Quantitative profiling of two dimensional gels by Dymension software analysis displayed 3.58 fold increased expression of ∼43kDa protein in squamous cell carcinoma and 2.92 fold in case of adenocarcinoma. Mass spectrometric analysis resulted in identification of 8 differentially expressed proteins, out of which human Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 was targeted for further validations. This candidate protein exhibited N-linked glycosylation at five amino acid residues; 33, 56, 72, 93, and 103 with significant score of 0.66, 0.78, 0.78, 0.53 and 0.66, respectively. Sandwich ELISA quantified high serum levels of Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 in squamous cell carcinoma (2.93g/l±1.22) and adenocarcinoma (2.39g/l±1.13) when compared with healthy controls (0.83g/l±0.21). One-way ANOVA analysis predicted highly significant variation of Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1, among all the study types (F-value 65.37, p-value 0.000). This study may prove as a non-invasive, cost effective and sensitive scheme for diagnosis of lung cancer, by passing the expensive and painful screening procedures.

Abstract: We present the thickness-dependence of the performance of planar heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) with 1,4,5,8-napthalene-tetracarboxylic-dianhydride (NTCDA) as interlayer between rubrene/C70. The S-shaped current–voltage (J–V) characteristic is observed in the optimization process of NTCDA thickness. With the increase of NTCDA thickness, device performance first increases then decreases, with the optimum thickness of 15nm. The observed thickness-dependence of S-kink is totally different from previous reports of BCP based OSCs. The anomalous J–V characteristics were investigated by using the impedance–potential technique. We find that larger impedance occurred in the device with thinner NTCDA interlayer, and the mechanism could be described by charge distribution between the interface of C70 and Al cathode. Finally, we propose an effective approach to eliminate the S-kink in J–V curves by postannealing processes.

Abstract: Stable and efficient planar perovskite solar cells have been demonstrated in a high relative humidity of 50% with a lead phthalocyanine (PbPc) hole-transporting layer (HTL). Porous PbI2 film is prepared on the PbPc HTL due to it hydrophobic property, which leads to a fast formation of a compact and homogeneous perovskite film with large grains. As a result, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.79% is obtained, which is comparable to the reference device with a traditional poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) HTL and one of the highest values among the reported perovskite solar cells prepared in a high humidity condition. More importantly, the device retains 45% of its maximum PCE after it is stored in high humidity condition in dark for 56 days, comparing to an almost full failure of the reference device after only 6 days. This improvement is attributed to the restricted absorption of moisture during device fabrication and storage processes.

Mefunidone ameliorates renal inflammation and tubulointerstitial fibrosis via suppression of IKKβ phosphorylation,

Abstract: Mefunidone is a new pyridone agent that attenuates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, the signaling pathways involved in the effect of mefunidone on renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis have not been well explained. Inflammatory response initiates and promotes renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase beta (IKKβ) is a master regulator of inflammation. This study is determined to clarify the influence of mefunidone on renal inflammation and the phosphorylation of IKKβ. Experimental renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis was induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) for 3, 7 and 14days in sprague dawley rat. Treatment with mefunidone was conducted simultaneously. Obstructed kidneys were harvested for the assessment. Our results showed that treatment with mefunidone ameliorated renal inflammatory injury, renal tubular lesions and interstitial fibrosis. Further studies indicated that treatment with mefunidone mitigated the expressions of tumor necrosis factorα (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the kidney. The phosphorylation of IKKβ and inhibitor of kappa-B (IκB) and the expression of NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NALP3) were also reduced in vivo after treatment with mefunidone. In vitro, peritoneal macrophages were incubated with necrotic cells or lipopolysaccharide in the presence or absence of mefunidone. Mefunidone markedly decreased necrotic cell or LPS induced IL-1β production and LPS induced TNFα production in primary peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, mefunidone significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKβ/IκB and nuclear transition of NF-κB p65 in peritoneal macrophages stimulated by necrotic cell or lipopolysaccharide. In conclusion, mefunidone serves as a novel anti-inflammatory agent that attenuates UUO-induced renal interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, possibly through suppressing IKKβ phosphorylation.

Differential cathepsin responses to inhibitor-induced feedback: E-64 and cystatin C elevate active cathepsin S and suppress active cathepsin L in breast cancer cells,

Abstract: Cathepsins are powerful proteases, once referred to as the lysosomal cysteine proteases, that have been implicated in breast cancer invasion and metastasis, but pharmaceutical inhibitors have suffered failures in clinical trials due to adverse side effects. Scientific advancement from lysosomotropic to cell impermeable cathepsin inhibitors have improved efficacy in treating disease, but off-target effects have still been problematic, motivating a need to better understand cellular feedback and responses to treatment with cathepsin inhibitors. To address this need, we investigated effects of E-64 and cystatin C, two broad spectrum cathepsin inhibitors, on cathepsin levels intra- and extracellularly in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Cathepsins S and L had opposing responses to both E-64 and cystatin C inhibitor treatments with paradoxically elevated amounts of active cathepsin S, but decreased amounts of active cathepsin L, as determined by multiplex cathepsin zymography. This indicated cellular feedback to selectively sustain the amounts of active cathepsin S even in the presence of inhibitors with subnanomolar inhibitory constant values. These differences were identified in cellular locations of cathepsins L and S, trafficking for secretion, co-localization with endocytosed inhibitors, and longer protein turnover time for cathepsin S compared to cathepsin L. Together, this work demonstrates that previously underappreciated cellular compensation and compartmentalization mechanisms may sustain elevated amounts of some active cathepsins while diminishing others after inhibitor treatment. This can confound predictions based solely on inhibitor kinetics, and must be better understood to effectively deploy therapies and dosing strategies that target cathepsins to prevent cancer progression.

Abstract: Kesterite quaternary semiconductor Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanocrystals were successfully prepared via a relatively simple electrospinning route and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Semiconductor Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanofibers were obtained for PVB/ Cu2ZnSnSe4 precursor at an applied voltage of 20kV after annealing treatment at 500°C for 2h. The optical property of Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanocrystals was also recorded by means of UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. It was shown that the dimension effect of composites could be enhanced by increasing the electrospinning conditions (voltage, distances, concentrations, viscosity) and the CZTSe nanofibers prepared at annealing process exhibited more intense optical properties. Temperature dependent studies were conducted and the annealing of composites was found to be the key factor in determining the phase formation.

Abstract: Low temperature (100 and 250°C) post-deposition annealings were applied to Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) absorbers to modify the ordering degree of the kesterite. Spectrophotometry and photoluminescence revealed a blue or red shift of the band gap and the luminescence peak after ordering or disordering post-treatments, respectively. For most solar cells, the open circuit voltage was found to be limited by bulk recombination and to follow band gap variations, leading to a constant open circuit voltage deficit. For the range of ordering degree investigated, the large open circuit voltage deficit, typically encountered in kesterite solar cells, could not be attributed to disorder. Capacitance–voltage measurements demonstrated that the net carrier concentration of ordered CZTSe is reduced by one order of magnitude compared to disordered CZTSe. Besides its beneficial effects on the open circuit voltage, the ordering post-treatment was also found to increase the collection of photo-generated carriers, resulting in a high current density and a significant improvement in device efficiency.

Abstract: In photovoltaics, the quality of the polymeric solar cell embedding material is of key importance for the long-term durability and performance of the PV modules. For the most common encapsulant, elastomeric ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), the degree of crosslinking is a key issue in this respect. Raman spectroscopy was researched as a fully contact-free, truly non-destructive optical method to measure the degree of EVA crosslinking of bare EVA film samples as well as in-situ inside assembled PV modules. The method relies on evaluating subtle but characteristic spectral differences in the CH-stretching vibration region (3.000–2.800cm−1) that correlate directly, unambiguously and reliably to the crosslinking state of the EVA encapsulant. With measurement times below one second per analysis point, the method is suitable for real-time, in-line quality control. Using a self-referencing data evaluation approach, the method could be designed to be widely immune to real-world effects, including different sample reflectivity and instrument drifts. Involving the reaction kinetics of the curing reaction, the Raman data can be converted into crosslinking readings that equal the traditional, Soxhlet-derived gel content values. The method has been successfully validated for bare foils, glass–backsheet and glass–glass modules with three different EVA types and deployed in-line in a commercial PV module manufacturing line. Using Raman spectroscopy, it is thus possible to determine the degree of crosslinking of the EVA encapsulant inside assembled modules in-line and with high accuracy, even on moving modules.

Abstract: Considering the light-harvesting ability, thermal stability and low-cost, phthalocyanines have become suitable candidates used as dye sensitizers in DSSC. Here we fabricate a new type of phthalocyanine-sensitized solar cells with polyoxometalate-modified TiO2photoanode. Based on the PW12/TiO2(H3PW12O40, denoted as PW12) composite photoanode, the overall power conversion efficiency of the cell was improved obviously; this is mainly attributed to the increased electron transport and the reduced charge recombination in the cells, which has been revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit voltage decay measurements. These results obtained in this work show that incorporating polyoxometalates into TiO2 photoanodes can effectively improve the photovoltaic performance of phthalocyanine-sensitized solar cell, although the simple phthalocyanine sensitizer used is not of high efficiency. Thus this work provide a promising strategy to promote the photovoltaic performance of phthalocyanine-sensitized solar cell by modifying TiO2 photoanode with polyoxometalate.

Abstract: Thermochromic vanadium dioxide, VO2, is a semi-conductor of major interest for energy control applications. Generally, the fabrication of high-quality VO2 films requires a high deposition temperature over 400°C which limits its large scale implementation as well as its compatibility with temperature-sensitive substrates. In this work, we demonstrate the deposition of thermochromic VO2 thin films on flexible polymer substrates using High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS); this process is known for its high degree of ionization, high plasma density and hence high ion flux towards the substrate that allows one to deposit crystalline films at lower temperatures in comparison with conventional sputtering techniques. We first describe the optimization approach of the HiPIMS process followed by the optical performance study of the resulting VO2 films on Kapton polyimide substrates. The films deposited at temperatures as low as 275°C are then analyzed by means of temperature-resolved spectrophotometry, XPS, ERD, RBS, Raman spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Optimized films show an infrared modulation ΔT2500 nm of up to 50% with a transition temperature Tc close to the bulk temperature of 68°C.

Abstract: Thermal behavior is one of the most important properties for phase change microcapsules in solar energy storage. Here, a new type of phase change microcapsules was synthesized based on n-octadecane core and polymethylmethacrylate shell supplemented with modified silicon nitride powders, aiming to achieve improvement of thermal property in the phase change materials. SEM micrographs showed that the as-prepared microcapsules have a regular spherical shape with a well-defined core-shell structure. FTIR curves and EDS spectrogram demonstrated that silicon nitride can be well cross-linked with microcapsules after surface modification. In addition, TGA, forward looking infra-red system and DSC (before and after 500 heating and cooling cycles) analyses were performed to investigate the thermal property of the as-prepared microcapsules. The results indicated that the microcapsules have high thermal storage capability, enhanced thermal reliability and stability, and increased thermal conductivity. Especially, the thermal conductivity of microcapsules is enhanced by 56.8% compared with that of the microcapsules without the addition of silicon nitride.

Abstract: Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction is associated with increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Current evidence suggests a protective role of thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is unknown yet a putative role of Trx1 in sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction, in which oxidative stress is an underlying cause. Transgenic male mice with Trx1 cardiac-specific overexpression (Trx1-Tg) and its wild-type control (wt) were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture or sham surgery. After 6, 18, and 24h, cardiac contractility, antioxidant enzymes, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Trx1 overexpression improved the average life expectancy (Trx1-Tg: 36, wt: 28h; p=0.0204). Sepsis induced a decrease in left ventricular developed pressure in both groups, while the contractile reserve, estimated as the response to β-adrenergic stimulus, was higher in Trx1-Tg in relation to wt, after 6h of the procedure. Trx1 overexpression attenuated complex I inhibition, protein carbonylation, and loss of membrane potential, and preserved Mn superoxide dismutase activity at 24h. Ultrastructural alterations in mitochondrial cristae were accompanied by reduced optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) fusion protein, and activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) (fission protein) in wt mice at 24h, suggesting mitochondrial fusion/fission imbalance. PGC-1α gene expression showed a 2.5-fold increase in Trx1-Tg at 24h, suggesting mitochondrial biogenesis induction. Autophagy, demonstrated by electron microscopy and increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, was observed earlier in Trx1-Tg. In conclusion, Trx1 overexpression extends antioxidant protection, attenuates mitochondrial damage, and activates mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy and biogenesis), preserves contractile reserve and prolongs survival during sepsis.

Abstract: Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) with high efficiency and flexibility are demonstrated by using ultrathin Au and dielectric/metal/dielectric multilayered films as bottom and top electrode, respectively. An overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.67% and an average light transmittance (ALT) of 15.94% in the wavelength range of 500–2000nm were obtained for the PeSCs. The ALT can be further increased to 31.61% by reducing the thickness of the bottom Au electrode. Furthermore, the PeSCs show excellent flexibility and mechanical robustness, and the PCE maintains 88% of their original efficiencies after 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 3.9mm.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the effect of an enlarged surface area of nanotextured crystalline silicon wafers on the formation of n-type emitters using a tube diffusion process applying POCl3 as P dopant source. A fast, single-step and industrially viable F2-based dry texturing process is used to perform nanotexturing of Si wafers. This process is presented as an alternative route of nanotexturing in comparison to the two-step nanotexturing approach of creating black silicon and then modifying it with an alkaline or acidic solution. Predictive simulations of phosphorous in-diffusion aided by microscopical characterization of the selected emitters are used to understand the formation of emitter in nanotextured surfaces. Based on these investigations, we show that the optimized emitter leads to a significant improvement in short circuit current density (Jsc≥0.7mA/cm2) of nanotextured mc-Si solar cells in comparison to the industrial standard acidic textured solar cells.

Abstract: Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has attracted tremendous attention over last two decades and is currently regarded as a promising alternative to the conventional flexible photovoltaic (PV) market. Thin, light-weight and flexible DSSC module enables deployment on curved surfaces which significantly widens the application space. The critical challenge in advancing flexible DSSC technology remains in the up-scaling of module dimensions. Herein, we report advancement achieved in developing large-scale flexible DSSC modules of the dimensions 100 mm×100 mm with conversion efficiency of 3.27%. A facile binder-free TiO2 paste was synthesized to fabricate firm TiO2 photoanode on plastic substrate at low temperature. Cold isostatic press (CIP) technique was utilized to not only improve the quality of film but also to increase the thickness of TiO2 film. Based on binder-free TiO2 paste, flexible DSSC module with dimension of 100mm×100mm was fabricated and demonstrated for mobile phone charging application under indoor light condition.

Abstract: Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) plays a crucial role in the melanogenesis and proliferation of melanocytes that is dependent on its abundance and modification. Here, we report that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces senescence and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) expression that is related to MITF. We found that MITF could bind TP53 to regulate CDKN1A. Furthermore, the interaction between MITF and TP53 is dependent on AKT activity. We found that AKT phosphorylates MITF at S510. Phosphorylated MITF S510 enhances its affinity to TP53 and promotes CDKN1A expression. Meanwhile, the unphosphorylative MITF promotes TYR expression. The levels of p-MITF-S510 are low in 90% human melanoma samples. Thus the level of p-MITF-S510 could be a possible diagnostic marker for melanoma. Our findings reveal a mechanism for regulating MITF functions in response to EGF stimulation and suggest a possible implementation for preventing the over proliferation of melanoma cells.

Abstract: Homeobox containing 1 (HMBOX1) is essential for the survival of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). However, the regulatory mechanism of HMBOX1 expression is still unclear. We recently found that a small molecule 6-amino-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (ABO) directly targeted annexin A7 (ANXA7) and inhibited its GTPase activity. In addition, both HMBOX1 and ANXA7 participated in the autophagy and apoptosis of HUVECs. But, their relationship in the regulation of HMBOX1 expression is unknown. In this study, we found that ABO could elevate HMBOX1 at translation level through inhibiting ANXA7 GTPase activity. ABO failed to increase HMBOX1 protein level in ANXA7-deficient HUVECs. TGFB2 overlapping transcript 1 (TGFB2-OT1) that was increased by ABO facilitated HMBOX1 expression by increasing La-related protein 1 (LARP1) expression. Furthermore, the protein level of HMBOX1 was decreased under oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) treatment in HUVECs and in the aortic endothelium of apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE−/−) mice, which could be reversed by ABO in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, ANXA7 was an endogenous regulator of HMBOX1, and ABO promoted HMBOX1 translation by inhibiting ANXA7 GTPase activity and enhancing TGFB2-OT1 expression. Besides, our data suggested that HMBOX1 might be a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Despite the intrinsic flexibility of organic electronic materials due to their thinness, a deliberate selection of materials on the basis of their mechanical—not just charge-transport—properties is required for applications with mechanically demanding form factors, such as those that exist in the field of wearable electronics. This paper describes a skin-wearable solar cell enabled by the deliberate selection or intentional plasticization of the components to enable an extreme level of stability under cyclic bending deformations. In particular, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films plasticized with 10% fluorosurfactant are used for both the anode and cathode, with the cathode layer further modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI) to lower the work function. Use of poly(3-heptylthiophene) (P3HpT) instead of the far more common poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron donor permitted extreme deformation because of its increased mechanical compliance (owing to its low glass transition temperature). Cells fabricated on 13-µm polyimide tape and adhered to human skin show stable performance when compressively strained by approximately 75%. These compressive strains produce convex and concave buckles with minimum radii of curvature of ca. 100µm. Finite-element modeling predicts that the films require the ability to withstand a range of strains of 10%, when both convex and concave bends are considered. These devices, enabled by the stretchable semiconductor P3HpT, withstand up to one thousand cycles of compression with less than 20% degradation in power conversion efficiency, whereas devices based on P3HT show greater degradation after only five cycles, and fail catastrophically by fifty cycles. The usefulness of the wearable solar cells is demonstrated by their abilities to power an LED and a digital watch.

Abstract: Device modeling of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based electron transport layer-free planar perovskite solar cells was performed. The simulation was conducted by the program SCAPS (Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator). With appropriate physical parameters, a high open-circuit voltage of 1.04V close to results reported experimentally was successfully reproduced in the simulation. Simulation results revealed a great dependence of PCE on the thickness and defect density of the perovskite layer. An optimum perovskite thickness of about 500nm was confirmed and it well consistent with the thickness range of real devices was derived. Meanwhile, parameters including the FTO/perovskite interface defect density as well as the doping concentration of the front contact (FTO) were identified to significantly influence the performance of the device. In particular, the interface quality at the FTO/perovskite interface has greater impact on the device parameters than that at the perovskite/HTL interface, which suggests that more attention should be paid to the front FTO/perovskite interface to further enhance the performance of electron transport layer-free device. Appropriate interface defect passivation to reduce the interface defect density to the order of ~1015cm−3 is necessary and urgently needed. Lastly, the effect of the electron and hole mobility and carrier diffusion length of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx were also analyzed and the results revealed that the mobility and diffusion length experimentally reported (~1.0µm) are large and long enough for high efficiency.

Abstract: Today׳s population growth and increasing dependency of industry and technology on fossil energy encounters all countries and communities with challenge of energy for future. Hence researches about renewable energies, especially solar energy are considered. Among all types of solar systems, the optimization of direct absorption solar collector performance which the solar radiation received by the fluid medium, have been investigated. Since nanofluids are considered as an appropriate environment to absorb solar energy as well as increase in heat transfer coefficient, in present work, the morphological structure, the stability, the optical properties and thermal conductivity of nanofluid have been investigated by preparing nanofluid containing graphene nanoplatelets on the bases of deionized water by 0.00025, 0.0005, 0.001 and 0.005wt%. Finally, by investigating the effect of weight percent and temperature of nanofluids on optical properties and thermal conductivity, this nanofluid with strong absorption band in the range of 250–300nm as a suitable environment is offered to be used in direct absorption collectors.

Abstract: The low density of silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) in a dielectric matrix is one of the plausible reasons for the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Si QD solar cells due to large spacing between QD and substrate. In this study, the electrical properties of the Si QD layers were improved by increasing the density of Si QDs and reducing the barrier width. In the previous studies, Si QD layers were fabricated by alternating deposition of SiO2/SiOx layers and subsequent high temperature (1100°C) annealing, where the diffusion of Si species in the SiOx layer into Si substrate was observed. In order to prevent the diffusion, we propose the substitution of the SiOx layer with an amorphous Si (a-Si) layer. In [SiO2 (2nm)/SiOx (2nm)]×34 multilayer structures, the first few SiOx layers were substituted with a-Si layers. As a result, Si QDs could be well formed in the a-Si layer with high density and survived near the interfaces between the first Si QD layer and Si substrate. The distance of the nearest Si QDs from the Si substrates was also reduced from 7.2nm to 3.6nm, which results in the effective carrier transfer by tunneling between the Si QDs. The PCE of heterojunction B-doped Si QDs/crystalline Si solar cells was enhanced by using the Si QD structures with the improved electrical properties. Since the variations of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are not so large, the enhancement of PCE is mainly related with the improvement of fill factor due to the decrease of series resistance.

Abstract: We present structural and optical spectroscopy studies of thin films of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) with strong copper deficiency deposited on Mo/Glass substrates and selenised at 450, 500 or 550°C. Solar cells fabricated from these films demonstrated efficiencies up to 7.4% for selenisation at 500°C. Structural analysis based on X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy revealed the presence of SnSe2 in the film selenised at 450°C but not in the films selenised at higher temperatures. A progressive decrease of the Sn and Se content was observed as the selenisation temperature increased. Photoluminescence excitation was used to determine the bandgaps at 4.2K. Detailed measurements of the temperature and excitation intensity dependencies of the photoluminescence spectra allow the recombination mechanisms of the observed emission bands to be identified as band-to-impurity and band-to-band transitions, and their evolution with selenisation temperature changes to be analysed. The strongest band-to-band transition is recorded in the PL spectra of the film selenised at 500°C and can be observed from 6K to room temperature. The compositional and structural changes in the films and their influence on the optoelectronic properties of CZTSe and solar cells are discussed.

Abstract: The practical design of a wirelessly controlled portable IV-curve tracer based on a capacitive load is described. The design is optimized for the measurement of solar cell modules presenting a high open circuit voltage of up to 6kV and a low short circuit current below 100mA. The portable IV-tracer allows for on-site/in-situ characterization of large modules under real operating conditions and enables fast detection of potential failure of anomalies in electrical behavior. Currently available electronic loads only handle voltages up to around 1kV. To overcome cost and safety issues related to high voltage applications, the design is based on low cost components, battery-based isolated supply and wireless communication. A prototype has been implemented and field tested for characterization of different organic photovoltaic modules (OPV) made according to the infinity concept with a large number of serially connected single junctions (~7.450 single junctions) presenting open circuit voltages up to 5.6kV.

Abstract: Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are still attracting great attention as a potential alternative to conventional silicon solar cells, and a lot of current research is focusing on enhancing their efficiency through the individual improvement of the DSSCs components, as well as their integration. Among all components, mesoporous TiO2 plays a major role, because it is the charge collector for the dye molecules or perovskite in liquid and solid DSSCs, respectively. Specificities of TiO2 are now well-known: an anatase crystalline structure for an optimized bandgap, small particle size to shorten the charge diffusion path, reduced grain boundaries to limit current resistivity, significant porosity to enhance integration and interaction between the photon absorbers and the charge-collecting anode. We reported previously how well-crystallized small nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via a room temperature synthesis by Hegazy and Prouzet (2012) [10], leading to very small crystallites (4–10nm) of pure TiO2 anatase. Since as-synthesized materials still contain hydration water, a major drawback in DSSCs, we report here how dehydration and crystallinity can be improved by annealing at a moderate temperature, without any sintering or significant particle coarsening. The resulting impact on properties is confirmed by testing the resulting annealed TiO2 nanopowder in photovoltaic liquid DSSCs. In addition, we describe a comprehensive study of the preparation and test of TiO2 based photoanodes, including UV exposure and HCl treatment. Photovoltaic tests were conducted on a large active surfaces (5cm2) cells to give a more realistic picture of the influence of each parameter involved in the cell performance, characterized under AM 1.5 illumination with 100mWcm−2 light intensity. The specific contribution of each parameter on the cell performance is discussed. We demonstrate why the TiO2 nanopowder developed in our previous synthesis, in connection with the suitable treatments during the photoanode preparation, can replace commercial powders, with a greater success in cell photoefficiency.

Abstract: The main steps of p-layer development in pin thin film amorphous silicon solar cell at TEL Solar are presented. First, the implementation of a new PECVD reactor is shown to contribute to an improvement in amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) p-layer quality probably by reducing the porosity and leading to an increased open circuit voltage after the solar cell is subjected to light soaking. Second, an alternative high flow deposition regime for the p-doped a-SiC layer was successfully developed improving the layer purity and electrical conductivity. And third, a softer deposition regime for the very first part of the p-layer, the contact layer, which plays a crucial role in the release of Zn from the TCO, contributes to a decreased overall Zn contamination.

Abstract: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an effective methodology to assess the energy and environmental impacts of energy systems during their life cycle, including manufacturing, operation and end-of-life. The aim of the paper is the application of a simplified LCA tool, developed in the framework of the International Energy Agency Solar Heating and Cooling Task 48, for comparing different typologies of solar assisted heating and cooling systems. In detail, solar thermal heating and cooling systems located in Palermo (southern Italy) and in Zurich (Switzerland) were compared with conventional systems assisted by grid connected and stand-alone photovoltaic plants. A validation of the tool was also carried out by comparing the obtained results with those of in-depth LCA studies. The results showed that the best system configuration in Palermo is the conventional system assisted by a grid-connected photovoltaic plant. Its impact on global energy requirement is about 83.7% and 74.5% of the corresponding impact of the solar thermal heating and cooling and the conventional system assisted by a stand-alone photovoltaic system, respectively. Different considerations can be made for Zurich, where the solar heating and cooling system performs better than the others; it is characterized by a global energy requirement that is 85.3% and 81.2% of the grid-connected and stand-alone photovoltaic assisted conventional systems, respectively. A similar trend is traceable for the global warming potential indicator. The validation of the LCA tool proved it to be reliable since deviations with a detailed LCA of the same system are contained below a 5% difference in all the comparable systems.

Abstract: Elucidating the complex pathogen-host interaction is essential for a comprehensive understanding of how these remarkable agents invade their hosts and how the hosts defend against these invaders. During the infection, pathogens interact intensively with host to enable their survival, which can be revealed through their interactome. Edwardsiella tarda is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen causing huge economic loss in aquaculture and a spectrum of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases in humans. E. tarda is an ideal model for host-pathogen investigation as it infects fish in three distinct steps: entering the host, circulating through the blood and establishing infection. We adopted a previous established proteomic approach that inactivated E. tarda cells and covalent crosslink fish plasma proteins were used to capture plasma proteins and bacterial outer membrane proteins, respectively. By the combinatorial use of proteomic and biochemical approaches, six plasma proteins and seven outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were identified. Interactions among these proteins were validated with protein-array, far-Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation. At last, seventeen plasma protein-bacteria protein⿿protein interaction were confirmed to be involved in the interaction network, forming a complex interactome. Compared to our previous results, different host proteins were detected, whereas some of the bacterial proteins were similar, which indicates that hosts adopt tissue-specific strategies to cope with the same pathogen during infection. Thus, our results provide a robust demonstration of both bacterial initiators and host receptors or interacting proteins to further explore infection and anti-infective mechanisms between hosts and microbes.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic pathology caused by mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.
Objectives
As the intestine harbors the greatest number of CFTR transcripts after birth and since CFTR plays a role in glutathione transport, we hypothesized that CFTR deletion might produce oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation in CF intestinal epithelial cell.
Methods
CFTR gene was abrogated in Caco-2/15 enterocytes through the zinc-finger nuclease system. Their oxidative and inflammatory characteristics were appreciated under basal conditions and after the treatment with the pro-oxidant iron-ascorbate (Fe/Asc) complex and pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Results
Intestinal epithelial cells with CFTR knockout spontaneously exhibited an increased lipid peroxidation level, reflected by malondialdehyde overproduction and reduced antioxidant defense characterized by low enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase. CFTR silencing also resulted in elevated protein expression of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis Factor-α, interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB. Moreover, exaggerated OxS and inflammation processes occurred in CFTR−/− cells in response to the addition of Fe/Asc and LPS, respectively.
Conclusions

CD2-associated protein/phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling has a preventive role in angiotensin II-induced podocyte apoptosis,

Abstract: Angiotensin II (Ang II) works as a paracrine or autocrine cytokine agent to regulate renal functions and promotes podocytes dysfunction directly or indirectly, causing proteinuria. The glomerular slit diaphragm (SD) serves as a size-selective barrier and is linked to the actin-based cytoskeleton by adaptor proteins, including CD2-associated protein (CD2AP). Therefore, damages to CD2AP affect not only the function of the SD, but also directly disrupt the podocyte cytoskeleton, leading to proteinuria. In addition, CD2AP can facilitate the nephrin-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt signaling, which protects podocytes from apoptosis. Here we found that CD2AP staining was located diffusely but predominantly in the peripheral cytoplasm and CD2AP co-localized with nephrin in mouse podocytes; however, Ang II decreased CD2AP staining diffusely and induced a separation from concentrated nephrin. Ang II notably reduced CD2AP expression in time- and concentration-dependent manners, and this was significantly recovered by losartan. Ang II induced podocyte apoptosis in time- and concentration-dependent manners in TUNEL and FACS assays. LY294002, a PI3-K inhibitor, further reduced CD2AP expression and increased podocyte apoptosis, which was augmented by siRNA for CD2AP. Thus, Ang II induces the relocalization and reduction of CD2AP via AT1R, which would cause podocyte apoptosis by the suppression of CD2AP/PI3-K signaling.

Abstract: A two-step process with post-annealing of stacked precursors has been widely used for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorbers. However, no simple approach is currently available for simultaneously tuning the S/(S+Se) ratio and avoiding tin loss issue in CZTSSe films, which are critical factors to achieve high efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate by simply adding SnS powder during selenization, we can eliminate the tin loss and also control the S/(S+Se) ratio. Furthermore, we can suppress the formation of Mo(S,Se)2 during selenization. Based on thermodynamic calculations, we propose SnS powder reacts with selenium to form SnSe and releases sulfur vapor during selenization. The Sn-contained vapor avoids tin evaporation from CZTSSe. By varying the amount of SnS powder, the partial pressure ratio of sulfur to selenium can be tuned; therefore, the film composition and band bap of CZTSSe can be changed. The presence of sulfur partial pressure also dramatically decreases the formation of Mo(S,Se)2 during selenization. The efficiency is substantially boosted from 3.97% to 7.35% by adding SnS powder during selenization. Our approach realizes one-step sulfo-selenization, providing a general tuning knob for compositional control of CZTSSe absorbers, which shines light on various process developments of CZTSSe absorbers by post-annealing vacuum- or solution-fabricated precursors.

Abstract: The change of electrical conductivity in chalcopyrite (i.e., Cu(Inx, Ga1−x)Se2 or CIGSe) solar cells induced by nanosecond laser pulses is investigated as a function of the elemental composition and its spatial distribution. The underlying laser induced phase transformation process, which results in a decomposition of the CIGSe semiconductor and a modification of its elemental composition, is utilized to form the monolithic series interconnection between front and back contact in CIGSe based thin film solar cells. The results show a dependence of the composition of the CIGSe layer and the resulting series resistance on the applied laser fluence. Lower series resistance is primarily related to an enhanced fraction of copper, gallium and zinc in the laser transformed zone resulting from selective vaporization of absorber elements. For intermediate laser fluences (~0.36J/cm2) a patterning process is established that allows reliable and high-quality series interconnection. Both, lower and higher laser fluences result in high series resistances due to incomplete phase transformation or damages of the back contact, respectively.

Abstract: Iron oxide nanostructures have emerged as promising materials for being used as photocatalysts for hydrogen production due to their advantageous properties. However, their low carrier mobility and short hole diffusion length limit their efficiency in water splitting. To overcome these drawbacks, in the present study, we synthetized a new hematite (α-Fe2O3) bi-layered nanostructure consisting of a top nanosphere layer and a nanotubular underneath one by electrochemical anodization. Annealing parameters such as temperature, heating rate and atmosphere were studied in detail in order to determine the optimum annealing conditions for the synthetized nanostructure. The obtained new bi-layered nanostructure was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Mott–Schottky analysis and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. The results show the best water splitting performance for the bi-layered nanostructure annealed in argon atmosphere at 500°C at a heating rate of 15°Cmin−1 achieving a photocurrent density of ~0.143mAcm−2 at 1.54V (vs. RHE). The results indicate that the bi-layered nanostructure is an efficient photocatalyst for applications such as water splitting.

Abstract: Carbon nanofluids are engineered materials with controllable thermal and optical properties. Stable, high temperature operation (>20) of these fluids would enable them to improve upon – and eventually replace – pure fluids in many important commercial and industrial applications including applications in solar thermal collectors. To date, however, much of the nanofluids research focuses on low temperature (<100°C) applications and testing. For solar thermal collector applications, carbon nanofluids are uniquely well-suited due to their high absorptivity over the entire solar spectral range. This study pushes well beyond the 100°C mark by conducting a range of experiments to identify appropriate base fluids and functionalization methods to produce stable carbon nanotube (CNT)-based nanofluid dispersions at temperatures of up to 250°C to ensure their suitability for industrial heating applications (typically 100–250°C). Different forms of CNTs including, single-walled carbon nanotubes, double-walled carbon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were chemically functionalized to obtain stable dispersions in water, glycol and Therminol (a synthetic heat transfer oil). The stability of chemically functionalized carbon nanotube dispersions at different temperatures, 20, 80, 100, 150, 200 and 250°C, was investigated. The results of broadband UV–VIS–NIR spectroscopy showed no agglomeration in mildly oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes dispersed in Therminol when heated to 250°C, highlighting this low-cost composite medium as a potential candidate for use in high temperature nanofluid-based solar thermal collectors.

Abstract: Redox regulation plays a key role in several physiopathological contexts and free radicals, from nitric oxide and superoxide anion up to other forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS), have been demonstrated to be involved in different biological and regulatory processes. The data reported in the current literature describe a link between ROS, inflammation and programmed cell death that is attracting interest as new pathways to be explored and targeted for therapeutic purposes. In this light, there is also growing attention to the involvement of this link in the activity of the TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL is a member of the TNF ligands super family able to mediate multiple intracellular signals, with the potential to lead to a range of biological effects in different cell types. In particular, the hallmark of TRAIL is the ability to induce selective apoptosis in transformed cells leaving normal cells almost unaffected and this feature has already opened the door to several clinical studies for cancer treatment. Moreover, TRAIL plays a role in several physiological and pathological processes of both innate and adaptive immune systems and of the cardiovascular context, with a strong clinical potential. Nonetheless, several issues still need to be clarified about the signaling mediated by TRAIL to gain deeper insight into its therapeutic potential. In this light, the aim of this review is to summarize the main preclinical evidences about the interplay between TRAIL and redox signaling, with particular emphasis to the implications in vascular physiopathology and cancer.

Abstract: Nanomaterials based on titanium di-oxide (titania) are intensively being studied for their incorporation in the next generation photovoltaic devices due to titania׳s excellent photocatalytic properties. Inefficient utilisation of deeper visible and near infra-red region (NIR) photons has however limited the exploitation of such materials. In this paper, we report a unique titanium oxide nanomaterial that is sensitive to photons of wavelength even longer than 600nm and is composed of not one but multiple phases of titanium oxide. It has exhibited enhanced absorption that is three times greater in visible region and six times greater in NIR than base titanium. Synthesised by a phenomenon created via the interaction of ultrashort pulses with a titanium substrate, this photoabsorptive nanomaterial is dopant free and is structurally formed as a dense three dimensional network. Further effective tuning of the optical properties of the synthesised multiphase titanium oxide nanomaterial can make it a potential absorber material in photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: A compositionally graded silicon germanium (Si1−xGex) buffer layer is a leverage technology that grows III–V materials on silicon (Si) substrates with low threading dislocation density. This study determined average optical absorption coefficients of Si1−xGex graded buffer layers at wavelengths beyond the band gap of Si by measuring the transmittances of Si1−xGex on Si wafers. The results show that assuming linear changes of absorption coefficients of Si1−xGex with the change of germanium (Ge) composition will significantly overestimates the absorption in the Si1−xGex graded buffer layers. Using determined average absorption coefficients of graded buffer layers, an accurate optical model was developed for a fabricated planar Si0.15Ge0.85 on Si solar cell. This model shows that significant amounts of light at the band edge of Si are absorbed by the Si substrate. However, the majority of the light absorbed by the Si substrate cannot contribute to the short-circuit current of the solar cell, as the generated electron-hole carriers are too far away from the p-n junction and thus have a very low probability of being collected by the p-n junction. By thinning the Si substrate from 675µm to 200µm, a 0.5mA/cm2 short-circuit current density (JSC) improvement under AM1.5G spectrum was observed on the Si0.15Ge0.85 solar cell. Further thinning the Si substrate to 50µm should lead to a total JSC gain of 1.6mA/cm2. This study provides a practical path for achieving a highly efficient two-terminal current matched GaAsP/SiGe tandem solar cell on Si substrate.

Abstract: In the present work we report the synthesis of highly meso- and macro-porous thin TiO2 films as efficient scaffolds for improved performance of heterojunction solid state perovskite solar cells made in Fambient air. TiO2 films were prepared using sol–gel process and Pluronic P-123 block copolymer as organic template while they were formed on conductive glass substrates by spin-coating method. The films were employed to the construction of very efficient perovskite solar cells made at ambient conditions where CH3NH3PbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite was used as light harvester and P3HT polymer as hole conductor. The very rough and highly porous TiO2 films proved to be an excellent host material for perovskite growth. The structural properties of the TiO2 electron transport layer, thickness, particle size and porosity, strongly affected the overall conversion efficiency. The optimal structure and materials composition exhibited a notably high current density Jsc of 23.8mA/cm2, Voc of 0.995V and fill factor of 0.58. These solar cells prepared under ambient conditions yielded an average power conversion efficiency of 13.7% among the best ever recorded with P3HT polymer as hole conducting material.

In this work, we report on the high capacity of Co0.5TiOPO4/C electrode material. In particular, at C rate, the discharge capacity of more than 210mAh/g was maintained for 80 charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, Co0.5TiOPO4/C composite exhibits excellent rate-capability with excellent coulombic efficiency. The outstanding electrochemical performance of Co0.5TiOPO4/C anode material might be attributed to its well crystallinity, controlled morphology due to the sol–gel preparation method, and the particles surface carbon-coating.

Abstract: The Akirin gene family normally contains two members that are essential to myoblast differentiation. Noticeably, the avian Akirin gene family comprises only one gene (Akirin2), However, it remains unknown whether avian Akirin gene family still has the function of Akirin1; moreover, it is still unclear whether and how Akirin2 plays a role in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, the unexpected functions of duck Akirin2 were revealed in the present study. The Real-time PCR results showed that between 12 and 48h during the process of duck myoblasts differentiation, the overexpression of Akirin2 did not significantly increase the expression of myogenic regulatory factors. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the cell cycle transition was accelerated by Akirin2 overexpression. Moreover, the overexpression of Akirin2 did not influence the myotube formation. Strikingly, when duck myoblasts were cultured in the growth medium, the overexpression of Akirin2 significantly enhanced cell viability. Although the expression of cyclin-dependent proteins did not significantly increase after transfection, the expression of the mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) increased. Furthermore, the protein expression of phospho-p70S6K (Ser 417) also increased. However, when rapamycin and pEGFP-N1-Akirin2 plasmids were added together to the growth medium, the positive impact of Akirin2 on cell viability and the mRNA expression of mTOR and p70S6K were significantly blocked. Furthermore, the expression of phospho-mTOR (Ser 2448) and phospho-p70S6K (Ser 417) were also blocked. Taken together, these results could suggest that duck Akirin2 could promote myoblast proliferation via the activation of the mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway.

Abstract: A technique to make poly-Si (p+)/SiOx contacts for crystalline silicon solar cells based on doping PECVD intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si) by means of a thermal BBr3 diffusion process is demonstrated. The thickness of the a-Si layer and the temperature of the boron diffusion are optimized in terms of suppressing carrier recombination and transport losses. Different interfacial layers are studied, including ultra-thin SiOx grown either chemically or thermally, and stacks of SiOx and SiNx. While the double SiOx/SiNx interlayers do not achieve the desired performance, both kinds of single SiOx layers produce satisfactory passivating contacts, with both a low recombination current and a low contact resistivity. By adjusting the boron diffusion temperature, recombination current parameter J0 values of ~16fA/cm2 to ~30fA/cm2 have been obtained for structures with initial a-Si thicknesses of 36–46nm, together with a contact resistivity of ~8mΩcm2.

Abstract: Feeding high-protein diets in animals can lead to a decrease of nitrogen utilization efficiency, and then promote the environmental pollution. Recently, more reports have demonstrated that lowering protein level in diets supplemented with specific amino acids can address these problems. However, the whole proteome alteration in the skeletal muscle of weaned piglets fed low-protein diets is poorly understood. Here, we applied the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification approach to investigate this alteration. We fed weaned piglets with normal protein diet (20% crude protein) and low-protein diet supplemented with lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan (17% crude protein) for 25days. Then proteomic profiling of skeletal muscles was performed. In total, 1354 proteins were quantified in the porcine skeletal muscle proteome. 132 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins between the two groups. Differentially expressed proteins were significantly enriched in various nutrient metabolism including lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. Interestingly, a total of 20 differentially expressed proteins, which are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, were all down-regulated by the low-protein diet feeding. Further immunoblotting confirmed the down-regulations of MT-ATP8, COX2, NDUFA6, and SDHB, four selected proteins among these 20 proteins. Meanwhile, the ATP level in the low-protein diet group was also reduced. These findings for the first time reveal that oxidative phosphorylation pathway is suppressed in longissimus dorsi muscle of weaned piglets fed low-protein diet supplemented with limiting amino acids, which may provide new insights into further formula design and the choice of limiting amino acids in diets.

Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a widely used transparent conductive material for thin-film solar cells. Naturally textured ZnO deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) is currently used to prepare high efficiency thin film silicon solar cells. However it is known that a strong roughness can disturb the growth of microcrystalline silicon and induce performance losses. An alternative approach denominated “nanocrystalline ZnO” is presented which allows to control surface roughness and haze during growth independently of other layer properties such as thickness, doping or conductivity for layers thicker than approximately 80nm. Surface morphologies, optical properties and material properties of the nanocrystalline ZnO layers together with solar cells results are presented.

Abstract: During bioethanol fermentation process, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane is the first target to be attacked by the accumulated ethanol. In such a prominent position, S. cerevisiae cell membrane could reversely provide protection through changing fluidity or elasticity secondary to remodeled membrane components or structure during the fermentation process. However, there is yet to be a direct observation of the real effect of the membrane compositional change. In this study, atomic force microscope-based strategy was performed to determine Young's modulus of S. cerevisiae to directly clarify ethanol stress-associated changes and roles of S. cerevisiae cell membrane fluidity and elasticity. Cell survival rate decreased while the cell swelling rate and membrane permeability increased as ethanol concentration increased from 0% to 20% v/v. Young's modulus decreased continuously from 3.76MPa to 1.53MPa while ethanol stress increased from 0% to 20% v/v, indicating that ethanol stress induced the S. cerevisiae membrane fluidity and elasticity changes. Combined with the fact that membrane composition varies under ethanol stress, to some extent, this could be considered as a forced defensive act to the ethanol stress by S. cerevisiae cells. On the other hand, the ethanol stress induced loosening of cell membrane also caused S. cerevisiae cell to proactively remodel membrane to make cell membrane more agreeable to the increase of environmental threat. Increased ethanol stress made S. cerevisiae cell membrane more fluidized and elastic, and eventually further facilitated yeast cell’s survival.

Abstract: In this study, colloidal nanoparticles of molybdenum oxide were prepared through a simple electrochemical anodizing of molybdenum sheets in 0.02M HCl electrolyte. The initial transparent electrolyte turned into a long-term stable dark blue color during the anodizing process. The blue liquid exhibited several optical absorption peaks and shoulders at photon energies of 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.9eV. However, to examine the gasochromic coloration in the liquid phase, the colloidal solution must be initially colorless. Moreover, the liquid with gasochromic property is required to be catalytically active against hydrogen gas. These tasks were performed by adding precursor PdCl2 solution. It was observed that PdCl2 not only activates the liquid for gasochromic coloration, but also removes the initial blue color. General characterizations were performed on drop-dried samples by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–vis spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The decolorized colloidal molybdenum oxide samples exhibited unique in-liquid gasochromic colorations by diluted hydrogen bubbling, which converted the colorless solutions back to the dark blue color. The gasochromically colored samples showed absorption bands analogous to those of as-prepared blue samples along with an extra shoulder at around 3eV. The coloration mechanism was described according to two existing models; small polaron and charge transfer models.

Both c9-t11 and t10-c12CLA stimulated early stage pre-adipocyte differentiation (day 2), while t10-c12CLA inhibited late differentiation (day 8) as determined by lipid droplet numbers and both perilipin-1 levels and phosphorylation state. At day 8, the adipokines adiponectin, chemerin and adipsin were all reduced in t10-c12CLA treated cells versus control cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed perilipin-1 was present solely on lipid droplets on day 8 in t10-c12 treated 3T3-L1 cells, whereas preilipin-1 was also located in the perinuclear region in control and c9-t11 treated cells. The t10-c12CLA isomer also decreased levels of hormone-sensitive lipase and inhibited lipolysis. These findings indicate that the decrease in lipid droplets caused by t10-c12CLA is the result of an inhibition of lipid droplet production during adipogenesis rather than a stimulation of lipolysis. Additionally, treatment with Gö6976 blocked the effect of t10-c12CLA on perilipin-1 phosphorylation, implicating PKCα in perilipin-1 phosphorylation, and thus a regulator of triglyceride catabolism. These data are supported by evidence that t10-c12CLA activated PKCα. These are the first data to show that CLA isomers can affect lipid droplet dynamics in adipocytes through PKCα.

Abstract: Low-cost electrochromic devices presenting fast switching continue to have an enormous interest for industrial applications; however the durability of the devices is a parameter of critical importance. The present work describes the preparation and characterization of ITO free electrochromic devices, being the use of hybrid electrodes for low-cost electrochromic devices the main focus. It was used silver grids (silver ink) as electrically conductive electrodes. These grids were screen-printed on polyethylene terephthalate (PET), using two different patterns and different line widths. The printing of a conductive polymer film on top of the grids for electrochemical protection of the metal was evaluated. These grids were characterized in terms of equivalent resistance and light transmission, considering each pattern, as well as electrochemical stability. The resulting electrochromic devices were tested using cyclic voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry and colorimetry. The durability of the devices was characterized through the analysis of color contrast over time during continuous operation conditions using a cycling program. These experiments displayed electrochromic devices performing 100 cycles before degradation with switching times of 4.5s and a color contrast (ΔE) of 27 or a variation in transmittance of 50% between redox states.

Abstract: Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signal transduction via the canonical Smad158 pathway has previously been linked to dynamin-dependent endocytosis, since the application of chemical inhibitors of clathrin or dynamin in functional cell culture based assays negatively affects initiation and propagation of the Smad response. More recent studies, however, demonstrated efficient Smad signaling by non-internalizable BMP2. The role of endocytosis in BMP signal transduction thus remained controversial. In our study we aimed to refine cell biological assays and to apply novel tools, including a new site-directed fluorescently labeled BMP2 ligand, to revisit key steps in BMP Smad signaling. We found that dynamin2 function was required for BMP2 uptake but was dispensable for C-terminal phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of BMP-dependent Smads. Furthermore, we demonstrated a role of dynamin2 in the regulation of steady-state and surface BMP receptor levels, as well as an impact on Smad1 protein level. Thus, dynamin2 allows for modulation of basal and ligand-dependent Smad signaling capacity. High levels of functional dynamin2 enhanced the myogenic differentiation of precursor cells. From our study we conclude that dynamin-dependent endocytosis serves as a regulatory mechanism to fine-tune Smad signaling, but it is not a prerequisite for signal initiation and propagation. Our findings contribute to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of BMP signaling and thus provide important information for future consideration in the context of therapeutic applications of BMPs.

Abstract: In order to improve the unsteady high temperature heat transfer performance of receivers in solar thermal power stations the receivers should be optimized further. High temperature could help to optimize heat transfer of the receiver. Based the selection of heat pipes and bromides this work prepared six samples of quaternary bromides with different composition ratios of KBr, LiBr, NaBr, and CaBr2 and their density and surface tension were measured and analyzed. Experimental results show that density of quaternary bromides shows very good linearity with salt temperature, and density of quaternary bromides is higher than that of Solar salt at a same temperature. Also, quaternary bromide NO.2 has maximum density, and quaternary bromide NO.3 has minimum thermal expansion coefficient while quaternary bromide NO.6 has the minimum density and maximum thermal expansion coefficient at the same temperature. In addition, quaternary bromide NO.1 has a maximum surface tension and fitting curve slope at a same temperature among the six samples of quaternary bromides. Their density and surface tension were fitted with linear fit with their temperature respectively. Furthermore, that the composition ratio has evident influence on the density and surface tension of quaternary bromides has been concluded.

Abstract: An optical spacer and a processing additive (PA) offer various advantages in the enhancement of the photocurrent in a polymer solar cell, but successful incorporation of both in one device has yet to be demonstrated. Indeed, an optical spacer is considered to conflict the use of a PA in the solar cell system. Here we demonstrate a significant enhancement of the photocurrent in a polymer solar cell via successful incorporation of a solution-processable titanium sub-oxide (TiOx) optical spacer and a PA. By using a simple, non-material-specific, and effective vacuum treatment before deposition of the TiOx optical spacer, the conflict between the optical spacer and PA was resolved and remarkable enhancement in photocurrent was attained without any loss in the fill factor and open-circuit voltage. When the TiOx optical spacer was introduced together with the 1,8-diiodooctane additive, the power-conversion efficiencies were significantly improved from 7.63% to 9.33% for the PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM device and from 5.5% to 6.46% for the P(BDT-TDPPDT-TPD)/PC70BM device, where PBDTTT-EFT stands for poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)], PC70BM stands for [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl, and P(BDT-TDPPDT-TPD) stands for poly[benzodithiophene-4,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dioctylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3(2H,5H)-dione-5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione].

Abstract: A wide consensus based on robust experimental evidence indicates pyroglutamylated amyloid-β isoform (AβpE3-42) as one of the most neurotoxic peptides involved in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, AβpE3-42 co-oligomerized with excess of Aβ1-42, produces oligomers and aggregates that are structurally distinct and far more cytotoxic than those made from Aβ1-42 alone. Here, we investigate quantitatively the influence of AβpE3-42 on biophysical properties and biological activity of Aβ1-42. We tested different ratios of AβpE3-42/Aβ1-42 mixtures finding a correlation between the biological activity and the structural conformation and morphology of the analyzed mixtures. We find that a mixture containing 5% AβpE3-42, induces the highest disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis and the highest neuronal toxicity. These data correlate to an high content of relaxed antiparallel β-sheet structure and the coexistence of a population of big spheroidal aggregates together with short fibrils. Our experiments provide also evidence that AβpE3-42 causes template-induced misfolding of Aβ1-42 at ratios below 33%. This means that there exists a critical concentration required to have seeding on Aβ1-42 aggregation, above this threshold, the seed effect is not possible anymore and AβpE3-42 controls the total aggregation kinetics.

Abstract: The surface treatment of Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films was carried out by utilizing ultrasonically generated water vapor. Suppression of the unintentional fluctuation of chemical composition near the heterointerface and enhancement in the homogeneity of CdS deposition on the Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films were observed in the samples with water vapor treatment at the temperatures between 250°C and 350°C. The effect on the variation of conduction band and valence band offsets at the Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS heterojunction, which was observed to be in a staggered alignment, was less than ±50meV due to the treatment. Reproducibility of the cell characteristics was improved by the H2O spray treatment of the Cu2ZnSnS4 absorbers before the deposition of CdS buffer layers. At treatment temperature of 300°C, the improvement of efficiency by about 25% compared to that of the untreated samples was achieved.

Abstract: Complex interplay of intracellular signaling networks, spanning from the extracellular environment to the nucleus, orchestrate normal cell growth and survival. Dysregulation of such signals contributes to malignant transformation, thereby giving the cancer cells a survival advantage, but also could be exploited for new anticancer interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pan class-I PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 on two distinct acute leukemia cell lines, NB4 (with mutant p53) and Nalm-6 (with wild-type p53). Our data highlighted the efficacy of the inhibitor against APL and pre B ALL cell lines; however, we failed to find an obvious correlation between p53 status and the sensitivity of leukemic cells to NVP-BKM120. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of p53 target genes in Nalm-6 cells, indicating a p53-dependent mechanism involved in NVP-BKM120 cytotoxicity. On the other hand, cytotoxic effects in mutant p53-expressing NB4 cells seem to be mediated mostly by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB axis. In conclusion, we suggest NVP-BKM120 induces apoptosis through p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms, indicating the potential application of the inhibitor in both wild-type and deficient p53-expressing leukemic cells.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality organic–inorganic halide perovskite films that have smooth and continuous surfaces and large crystal domains and possess photoelectrical properties preferable for photovoltaic applications is of paramount importance to achieve high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The introduction of other halide ions into the synthesis process of methylammonium lead triiodide, CH3NH3PbI3, to fabricate CH3NH3PbI3−xXx (X=Cl or Br) (x≈0) has been confirmed as an effective approach to optimize optoelectronic properties, thereby enhancing solar cell performance. However, the reported approaches to incorporate chlorine or bromine in perovskite films mainly take place during a liquid-phase synthesis process. Here, we report on bromide regulated CH3NH3PbI3 film formation through a low-pressure vapor-assisted deposition process. PbBr2 was used to either replace or to be mixed with PbI2 to form pre-deposited films that were then reacted with CH3NH3I vapor. Detailed structural, spectroscopic, and morphological characterizations of the perovskite films unambiguously demonstrate the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 films. However, bromine incorporation slows down the perovskite formation process through formation of an intermediate phase, CH3NH3PbBrxIy, which improves the grain domains in the as-fabricated perovskite films. Enhancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the as-fabricated planar-heterojunction structured PSCs were found for samples in which bromine was incorporated. Meanwhile, transient photovoltage decay measurements revealed that carrier recombination was suppressed throughout the entire device. When mixed PbI2/PbBr2 films with a molar ratio of 1:4 were used as re-deposited films, an optimized PCE of 17.40% was obtained.

Abstract: Increased electrical power generated from a thin-film silicon (TF-Si) photovoltaic device can lead to a reduced cost of electricity production that will support the mass adoption of this technology as a renewable energy source. Extracting the highest conversion efficiency from ‘champion’ large area TF-Si modules has been the focus of development at TEL Solar AG, Trübbach. The layer deposition process adjustments and further module technology improvements that led to a significant increase in the absolute stabilized module conversion efficiency of large area (1.43m2) tandem MICROMORPH™ modules centered first on obtaining high quality amorphous TF-Si deposited materials for the top cell. This was integrated with microcrystalline TF-Si material for the bottom cell that was deposited under conditions close to the transition point between the amorphous and microcrystalline growth regimes. In an optimized solar cell design the TF-Si materials were then combined with effective light management technologies and an improved module layout. The end result of a world record large area (1.43m2) stabilized module conversion efficiency of 12.34% was certified by the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI). The main technology contributions in the device design for this breakthrough result that generated more than 13.2% stabilized efficiency from each equivalent 1cm2 of the active area of the full module are described.

Abstract: Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been associated with a wide spectrum of clinical abnormalities. However, nuclear modifier gene(s) modulate the phenotypic expression of pathogenic mtDNA mutations. In our previous investigation, we identified the human GTPBP3 related to mitochondrial tRNA modification, acting as a modifier to influence of deafness-associated mtDNA mutation. Mutations in GTPBP3 have been found to be associated with other human diseases. However, the pathophysiology of GTPBP3-associated disorders is still not fully understood. Here, we reported the generation and characterization of Gtpbp3 depletion zebrafish model using antisense morpholinos. Zebrafish gtpbp3 has three isoforms localized at mitochondria. Zebrafish gtpbp3 is expressed at various embryonic stages and in multiple tissues. In particular, the gtpbp3 was expressed more abundantly in adult zebrafish ovary and testis. The expression of zebrafish gtpbp3 can functionally restore the growth defects caused by the mss1/gtpbp3 mutation in yeast. A marked decrease of mitochondrial ATP generation accompanied by increased levels of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species were observed in gtpbp3 knockdown zebrafish embryos. The Gtpbp3 morphants exhibited defective in embryonic development including bleeding, melenin, oedema and curved tails within 5days post fertilization, as compared with uninjected controls. The co-injection of wild type gtpbp3 mRNA partially rescued these defects in Gtpbp3 morphants. These data suggest that zebrafish Gtpbp3 is a structural and functional homolog of human and yeast GTPBP3. The mitochondrial dysfunction caused by defective Gtpbp3 may alter the embryonic development in the zebrafish. In addition, this zebrafish model of mitochondrial disease may provide unique opportunities for studying defective tRNA modification, mitochondrial biogenesis, and pathophysiology of mitochondrial disorders.

Abstract: In this work, we compared the photovoltaic performance of standard and inverted polymer solar cells with the aim to elucidate the origin of the different current output. We realized devices with both architectures using a blend film of poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiopene)-2,6-diyl] /[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PBDTTT-C:[70]PCBM). The standard cell sequence is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C:[70]PCBM/Ca/Al and the inverted one is ITO/ZnO/PBDTTT-C:[70]PCBM/MoO3/Ag. The inverted architecture shows better performances compared to the standard one mainly in terms of current output. The optical modeling has revealed that this architecture allows more photons to be absorbed in the blend film, giving rise to an higher current output, although the observed improvement cannot be completely attributed to the calculated higher absorption of the incoming light. By using the impedance spectroscopy analysis, we found that the inverted device architecture has higher values for the interface trap time constant and the density of interface states. Both parameters contribute to retain the charge collection efficient, compared to the standard configuration, despite the increased charge carrier density and to further improve the current output.

Abstract: Kesterite thin films solar cells have been studied in recent years as a potential earth abundant alternative to other thin film technologies such as the ones based on the chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS). However, the efficiency of the kesterite devices is still low and needs further development. In order to increase the performance of the kesterite solar cells, a better understanding of the influence of variations of compositions on the crystal lattice of the absorber layer is needed. This paper presents a study of how variations in the Cu content in the Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) absorber layer affects the crystal structure and therefore changes the optoelectronic properties of the solar cell. Three sets of CZTSe absorbers with different Cu content were synthesised by sputtering of metallic targets followed by a rapid thermal selenisation process. An accurate characterisation of the lattice parameters of the unit cell is presented, showing that a decrease of the Cu content in the CZTSe absorber layer diminishes the unit cell volume. This decrease in volume is related to an increase in the concentration of [VCu+ZnCu] and the ordering of the Cu/Zn atoms in the (001) plane. The variations in the lattice of CZTSe induced by decreasing the Cu content cause an increase of the bandgap of absorber layer, which leads to an increase of the open circuit voltage (VOC) in the devices. The best solar cell was based on the absorber layer with the lowest Cu content and yielded an efficiency of 8.1% with a fill factor of 59.8%, Jsc=31.1mA/cm2 and Voc=434mV.

Abstract: We discuss the development of a new composite dual cantilever beam (cDCB) thin-film adhesion testing method, which enables the quantitative measurement of adhesion on the thin and fragile substrates used in multijunction photovoltaics. In particular, we address the adhesion of several 2- and 3-layer antireflective coating systems on multijunction cells. By varying interface chemistry and morphology through processing, we demonstrate the marked effects on adhesion and help to develop an understanding of how high adhesion can be achieved, as adhesion values ranging from 0.5J/m2 to 10J/m2 were measured. Damp heat (85°C/85% RH) was used to invoke degradation of interfacial adhesion. We demonstrate that even with germanium substrates that fracture relatively easily, quantitative measurements of adhesion can be made at high test yield. The cDCB test is discussed as an important new methodology, which can be broadly applied to any system that makes use of thin, brittle, or otherwise fragile substrates.

Abstract: We investigated the impact of corrosion on pristine and thermally treated ZrOx/ZrC-ZrN/Zr absorber–reflector tandem solar selective coatings (ARTSSCs) on stainless steel (SS) and copper (Cu) substrates using microstructure, electrochemical and nanoindentation measurements. Electrochemical measurements are carried out in 3.5wt% NaCl solution, emulating the corrosion environments, under potentiodynamic polarization states. The corrosion treated samples exhibit strong correlations among microstructural, mechanical properties and their solar thermal responses. The thermally treated ZrOx/ZrC-ZrN/Zr structures on SS substrates show degraded corrosion resistance from 1379KΩ to 104KΩ for vacuum and 435KΩ for air thermal conditions. The measured mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus and hardness, substantiate the observed corrosion mediated degradation of thermally treated structures under both vacuum and air environmental conditions. The solar thermal performance shows degradation for both pristine and thermally treated sample after corrosion and room temperature after corrosion emissivity ‘ε27°C’ values are ~0.28, 0.35, 0.42 for pristine and thermally treated ZrOx/ZrC-ZrN/Zr structures respectively.

The sputtering deposited whole multilayer stacks, formed by a metallic infrared reflector, a double absorber composite and an antireflective layer, show optical performances as good as those obtained from similar composites such as Mo–Si3N4 but with improved stability in moderate vacuum at temperatures up to 600°C.

Abstract: The recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive settle that all new buildings should reach nearly zero energy levels by 2020 (2018 for buildings owned or occupied by public authorities). Therefore, technicians involved in building design, management and approval should be able to understand and apply nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB) concepts in both new buildings and renovation of existing ones. At European Union (EU) level there are large differences in commitment to the EU targets and the construction of nZEB between countries. It is thus urgent to develop studies to demonstrate the advantages of the nZEB and ZEB design process, increasing the awareness of both building clients and other stakeholders regarding this issue. In this context, the aim of this paper is to assess the energy and environmental life cycle performance of different renovation scenarios (Basic Renovation, nZEB and ZEB) for multifamily buildings in Portugal. This will be focused on the goals of the nZEB and ZEB design process and on the contribution of solar systems (solar thermal collectors, STCs, and photovoltaic panels, PVs) in the achievement of those goals. The results presented in this paper show that, in the Portuguese climate and for a typical multifamily building, it is possible to overcome 100% of the energy needs for acclimatization and domestic hot water (DHW) preparation with the integration of solar systems. From our results, it is also possible to conclude that a significant amount of energy and carbon emissions are avoided for every renovation scenario during the considered lifetime (30 years) and that the nZEB and ZEB scenarios are cost-effective with attractive payback times.

Abstract: The reversible phase transition VO2 exhibits, makes it a great candidate for energy efficient building glazing. Thus, a great need arises to optimize its optical and thermochromic properties, to be better suited for real smart window applications. In this study, thin films of Mg-doped VO2 have been successfully fabricated using RF reactive magnetron sputtering on commercially available products (glass coated with SnO2 buffer layer) and, for the first time, on ZnO/glass substrates, as an alternative buffer layer. Doping concentration is found to strongly affect the thermochromic properties of the films, namely the transition temperature (Tc) and transmittance modulation ability. XRD and SEM studies have been performed to examine the structural and morphological features of the Mg-doped films. Optical transmittance measurements vs. temperature have been used to calculate Tc and hysteresis width of the transition, resulting in the lowest recorded Tc value of 35°C, with respect to the literature, for an Mg-doped film (6at%). Furthermore, visible transmittance (Tlum) and solar modulation ability (ΔΤsol) have been determined for different doping concentration, and were correlated with an optical bandgap widening induced by the Mg presence. Overall, the 3at% Mg-doped film over ZnO/glass substrate presented the higher modulation ability of 4.5% and the best IR switching at 2000nm with a value of 26%.

Abstract: In this study thin films of hydrogenated In2O3 (IOH) were fabricated by physical vapor deposition (PVD) with and without a post-annealing step, and by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The electro-optical properties on glass as well as the performance as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer in CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGSe)-based solar cells are compared and related to a ZnO:Al (AZO) baseline TCO. Corresponding TCO film thicknesses were adjusted to a resulting sheet resistance of about Rsh = 20 Ω/sq for all samples. Structural investigations were conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while Hall and optical absorption measurements were performed to analyze the electrical and optical quality of the window layers. It is shown that the fully crystallized IOH layers processed by ALD and PVD show similar microstructural and electro-optical properties, which are superior to the AZO baseline. The finalized solar cells were characterized by current-voltage and reflectance-corrected quantum efficiency measurements. While there is no significant gain in short circuit current density (Jsc) for as-deposited PVD In2O3 layers, the application of crystalline In2O3 TCOs leads to an improvement of more than 2mA/cm2 due to an increase in “optical” band gap energy and less free charge carrier absorption (FCA). The open circuit voltage (Voc) of the best cells is 10–15mV higher as compared to the AZO reference, independent of the crystallinity and process of the In2O3 films. The results indicate that the gain in Voc is due to inherent material properties of the IOH films and does not originate from less sputter damage or an affected i-ZnO/TCO interface. Device simulations show that the higher electron affinity χ of the IOH can explain an increased Voc if the Fermi level (EF) is pinned at the CIGSe/CdS interface and why it might not be possible to see the gain when alternative buffer layers are applied.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PVKSCs) are an attractive technology that finds their potential in the field of renewable energy sources. Transparent conductive oxides including fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) and indium tin oxide (ITO) with high optical transmittance and low electrical resistivity are key components in PVKSCs. While commercial FTO or ITO either requires high temperature and high vacuum process or contains rare indium element, which will increase the production cost of PVKSCs. Here we report efficient electron-transport layer (ETL) free planar PVKSCs using the recycled FTO/glass substrates from degraded devices. By simple and low-temperature processes including organic solvent washing, ultrasonic cleaning and UV ozone treatment, the discarded substrates can be readily reused for fabricating ETL-free planar PVKSCs. The UV–vis optical transmission, crystal structure, sheet resistance, surface morphology, elemental composition and static contact angles measurement of the original and recycled FTO/glass substrates (one time and two times) were measured and compared. Planar ETL-free devices with power conversion efficiencies of about 10% have been achieved by adopting the recycled FTO/glass substrates, which are comparable to that of the devices based on the original FTO substrates, suggesting the feasibility of recycling the FTO/glass substrates from degraded devices for fabricating ETL-free PVKSCs.

Abstract: The activity of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), including 3-furan-2-yl-N-p-tolyl-acrylamide (PAM-2), 3-furan-2-yl-N-o-tolylacrylamide (PAM-3), and 3-furan-2-yl-N-phenylacrylamide (PAM-4), was tested on a variety of ligand- [i.e., human (h) α7, rat (r) α9α10, hα3-containing AChRs, mouse (m) 5-HT3AR, and several glutamate receptors (GluRs)] and voltage-gated (i.e., sodium and potassium) ion channels, as well as on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and β-amyloid (Aβ) content. The functional results indicate that PAM-2 inhibits hα3-containing AChRs (IC50=26±6μM) with higher potency than that for NR1aNR2B and NR1aNR2A, two NMDA-sensitive GluRs. PAM-2 affects neither the activity of m5-HT3ARs, GluR5/KA2 (a kainate-sensitive GluR), nor AChE, and PAM-4 does not affect agonist-activated rα9α10 AChRs. Relevant clinical concentrations of PAM-2–4 do not inhibit Nav1.2 and Kv3.1 ion channels. These PAMs slightly enhance the activity of GluR1 and GluR2, two AMPA-sensitive GluRs. PAM-2 does not change the levels of Aβ42 in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model (i.e., 5XFAD). The molecular docking and dynamics results using the hα7 model suggest that the active sites for PAM-2 include the intrasubunit (i.e., PNU-120596 locus) and intersubunit sites. These results support our previous study showing that these PAMs are selective for the α7 AChR, and clarify that the procognitive/promnesic/antidepressant activity of PAM-2 is not mediated by other targets.

Abstract: Hypoxia is a salient feature of most solid tumors and plays a central role in tumor progression owing to its multiple contributions to therapeutic resistance, metastasis, angiogenesis and stemness properties. Reports exist in literature about hypoxia increasing stemness characteristics and invasiveness potential of malignant cells. In order to delineate molecular crosstalk among factors driving glioma progression, we used knockdown and overexpression strategies. We have demonstrated that U87MG and A172 glioma cells inherently have a subset of cells with high migratory potential due to migration-inducing Mena transcripts. These cells also have elevated stemness markers (Sox-2 and Oct-4). There was a significant increase of number in this subset of migratory cells on exposure to hypoxia with corresponding elevation (over 1000 fold) in migration-inducing Mena transcripts. We were able to demonstrate that a HIF-2α-Sox-2/Oct-4-Mena (INV) axis that is strongly activated in hypoxia and markedly increases the migratory potential of the cells. Such cells also formed tumor spheres with greater efficiency. We have correlated our in-vitro results with human glioblastoma samples and found that hypoxia, invasiveness and stemness markers correlated well in native tumor samples. This study identifies a novel signaling mechanism mediated by HIF-2α in regulating invasiveness and stemness characteristics, suggesting that under hypoxic conditions, some tumor cells acquire more migratory potential by increased Pan Mena and Mena INV expression as a consequence of this HIF-2α mediated increase in Oct-4 and Sox-2. These properties would help the cells to form a new nidus after local invasion or metastasis.

Abstract: CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule that plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. The role of CD44 in tumorigenesis is due to its binding to extracellular matrix components, including hyaluronan (HA) and osteopontin (OPN), and to messenger molecules, such as growth factors present in the tumor microenvironment. HA and OPN are highly abundant in the leukemic stem cell niche and in solid tumors of various cancer types, where they contribute to the maintenance of the stemness of malignant cells. CD44 has consequently been recognized as a cancer stem cell marker in several types of cancers, which has been a topic of much recent research. In this review we have addressed the question of how CD44 might promote cancer cell stemness by interacting with extracellular matrix components, growth factors and cytokines.

Abstract: The 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy improves the survival of patients with colorectal cancer, however the main obstacle affecting its effectiveness is a drug resistance. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of TWIST1 silencing on the sensitivity of cancer cells to 5FU. The suppression of TWIST1 expression in human colon cancer HT29 and HCT116 cell lines was achieved by transduction with lentiviral vector carrying the TWIST1 silencing sequence (pLL3.7-shTWIST1). The suppression of TWIST1 expression induced changes in the expression pattern of epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers, reduced the cells proliferation rate, increased their sensitivity to serum withdrawn, and increased the cytotoxic effect of 5FU. However, significantly higher 5FU cytotoxicity was observed in HT29 cell cultures. Cells with silenced TWIST1 displayed altered expression of enzymes metabolizing 5FU. The expression level of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, and thymidylate synthase decreased significantly in HT29 shTWIST1 cells, but not in HCT116 shTWIST1 cells. On the other hand, significant increases in the expression levels of thymidine phosphorylase, and uridine phosphorylase 1 were seen in both cell lines with suppressed expression of TWIST1. The changes in enzymes expression were mirrored by enzymatic activities. In conclusion, our observations point to TWIST1 as a target protein to enhance the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to 5FU.

Abstract: The narrow-angle spectral specular reflectance and angular scattering of conventional and novel reflective materials for solar concentrators are measured over the wavelength range 300–2500nm at incidence angles ranging from 15° to 60° using a spectroscopic goniometry system. The solar-weighted specular reflectance at near normal incidence and an acceptance half-angle of 17.5mrad is 0.941 for back-silvered glass, 0.908–0.926 for silvered polymer films, 0.895 for aluminized polyester film, 0.939–0.954 for silvered aluminum sheets, and 0.860 for aluminized aluminum sheet. The angular scattering, quantified in terms of the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution, is found to be negligible for aluminized polyester (<0.05mrad) and back-silvered glass (<0.07mrad), and noticeable for silvered polymer films (0.27–1.12mrad) and silvered aluminum sheets (0.12–1.66mrad). In addition, the spectral transmittance of semi-transparent materials suitable for protective covers is measured, yielding solar-weighted normal transmittance values of 0.913 and 0.946 for 100μm thin films of ETFE (ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene) and FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene), respectively. The measured optical properties are incorporated in a Monte Carlo ray-tracing program and applied to analyze the optical performance of solar concentrators.

Abstract: In this work, we evaluate by means of simulations and measurements the effect of rear surface morphology on the performance of n-type rear-junction Passivated Emitter Rear Totally-diffused (PERT) solar cells with epitaxial emitter. A comparison of the electrical and optical performance between a rear polished and a rear textured surface was conducted on both test structures and solar cells. The effect of surface morphology on J0e for both emitters formed by either diffusion or epitaxy was investigated. It was found that epitaxy on a textured surface provides J0e values even better than boron diffusion and J0e for both surfaces (textured rear and polished rear) using ALD-Al2O3/PECVD SiOx as dielectric passivation are much lower than the ones by wet oxidation. A small difference in Voc between both surfaces was also predicted in our electrical simulations. Overall, the measurements show that n-type PERT solar cells with textured rear epitaxial emitter can perform at almost the same efficiency level to the ones with polished rear. For both types of n-PERT cells (textured rear and polished rear), average efficiencies (η) and short-circuit current densities (Jsc) exceeding 20.5% and 39mA/cm2, respectively were achieved on 238.9cm2 cells. Moreover, from our optical simulations it was found that either a textured rear surface or a non-perfect polished rear surface are ideal for light trapping at standard illumination conditions, with light impinging perpendicular onto the cell. However, a perfectly polished rear surface or one with pyramids at angles of 45° should be avoided. Finally, from a cost of ownership (CoO) point of view it was found that the potential efficiency gain originating from a rear polished surface is not cost effective. For polishing to become cost effective, the cell in the module should have an efficiency of 21.05% which is 0.45% more than the textured case.

Abstract: The vasoactive hormone angiotensin II initiates its major hemodynamic effects through interaction with AT1 receptors, a member of the class of G protein-coupled receptors. Acting through its AT1R, angiotensin II regulates blood pressure and renal salt and water balance. Recent evidence points to additional pathological influences of activation of AT1R, in particular inflammation, fibrosis and atherosclerosis. The transcription factor nuclear factor κB, a key mediator in inflammation and atherosclerosis, can be activated by angiotensin II through a mechanism that may involve arrestin-dependent AT1 receptor internalization. Peritoneal dialysis is a therapeutic modality for treating patients with end-stage kidney disease. The effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis at removing waste from the circulation is compromised over time as a consequence of peritoneal dialysis-induced peritoneal fibrosis. The non-physiological dialysis solution used in peritoneal dialysis, i.e. highly concentrated, hyperosmotic glucose, acidic pH as well as large volumes infused into the peritoneal cavity, contributes to the development of fibrosis. Numerous trials have been conducted altering certain components of the peritoneal dialysis fluid in hopes of preventing or delaying the fibrotic response with limited success. We hypothesize that structural activation of AT1R by hyperosmotic peritoneal dialysis fluid activates the internalization process and subsequent signaling through the transcription factor nuclear factor κB, resulting in the generation of pro-fibrotic/pro-inflammatory mediators producing peritoneal fibrosis.

Abstract: Simple diffuse rear reflectors can enhance the light path length of weakly absorbed near infrared light in silicon solar cells and set a benchmark for more complex and expensive light trapping structures like dielectric gratings or plasmonic particles. We analyzed such simple diffuse rear reflectors systematically by optical and electrical measurements. We applied white paint, TiO2 nanoparticles, white backsheets and a silver mirror to bifacial silicon solar cells and measured the enhancement of the external quantum efficiency for three different solar cell geometries: planar front and rear side, textured front and planar rear side, and textured front and rear side. We showed that an air-gap between the solar cell and the reflector decreases the absorption enhancement significantly, thus white paint and TiO2 nanoparticles directly applied to the rear cell surface lead to the highest short circuit current density enhancements. The short circuit current density gains for a 200µm thick planar solar cell reached up to 1.8mA/cm2, compared to a non-reflecting black rear side and up to 0.8mA/cm2 compared to a high-quality silver mirror rear side. For solar cells with textured front side the short circuit current density gains are in the range between 0.5 and 1.0mA/cm2 compared to a non-reflecting black rear side and do not significantly depend on the angular characteristic of the rear side reflector but mainly on its absolute reflectance.

Abstract: In the paper, the influences of Pb–Te–O (PTO) glasses with different Pb/Te ratios on silver screen-printed contact formation in crystalline silicon solar cells were investigated. Thermal properties of PTO glasses such as crystallization behavior, liquidus temperature and viscosity–temperature features are determined by Pb/Te ratio. Glass etching reaction, Ag dissolution–precipitation process and all key processes of Ag thick-film contact to crystalline silicon solar cells, are closely related to glass chemistry and Pb/Te ratio of PTO glasses. The dissolution process of Ag in PTO glasses with different Pb/Te ratio was studied. XPS measurement shows that Ag+ is the dominant form of silver dissolved in PTO glass melts. TG and XRD results reveal that the formation of a new B-rich liquid glassy-phase, induced by the crystallization of glass, accelerates the dissolution of Ag at lower temperature. Glass with higher Pb/Te ratio has a weaker glass etching reaction ability and is expected to have a high high-temperature viscosity, resulting in higher Ag-precipitate density in the glassy-phase. The observed microstructures, I–V electrical performance and contact resistance maps lead to a better understanding of the relationship between glass properties and contact resistance.

Abstract: In this study, flexible plastic electrochromic devices (ECDs) based on viologen-modified TiO2 nanostructured films thermally treated at only 120°C are reported. Even if a sintering process at typically above 450°C was avoided, the resulting mesoporous TiO2 films were highly transparent on both TCO-coated glass and plastic substrates while presenting adequate conductivity and high active surface area suitable for anchoring electro-chromophores. The synthesis of a viologen specifically designed to provide colorless-to-blue switching while being more compatible with plastic substrates than the traditional ethyl viologen is reported as well. The effect of the TiO2 layer thickness and pore characteristics as well as the grafting time on the device performance were also investigated. Transparent ECDs based on these viologen-modified TiO2 films have been assembled on flexible plastic substrate (ITO/PET) offering transmittance changes (ΔT) above 60% and switching speeds of 6–8s. The change in transmittance is further enhanced up to 71% in dual ECDs using PB on ITO/PET as the counter electrode and viologen-modified TiO2 films on FTO/glass. Finally, operational large-area all-solid devices (40cm×30cm) are presented, demonstrating the suitability of the present technology for the production of large-area plastic ECDs.

Abstract: Efficient large-area planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were successfully developed by adapting a scalable doctor blade printing method under ambient condition. To achieve high-quality perovskite films onto poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer, the PEDOT:PSS was modified by adding poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSH), which uses the electrostatic interaction between the sulfonyl functional groups in PEDOT:PSS and perovskite precursor ions. The resulting perovskite film on the modified PEDOT:PSS (M-PEDOT:PSS) exhibited excellent uniformity and surface coverage with high crystallinity even for large-area (15mm×40mm) scale. In addition, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the printed PSCs was significantly improved from 6% to 10.15% by introducing our M-PEDOT:PSS layer. This finding provides an important guideline to achieve highly efficient PSCs using scalable printing techniques.

Abstract: The near-field photocurrent mapping of InAs/InGaAs/GaAs quantum-dots intermediate-band solar cells by means of scanning near-field optical microscopy is discussed. By illumination through the InZn top contact at two different wavelengths (visible, 800nm, and near infrared, 1150nm), topography and photocurrent information were simultaneously collected. The lateral resolution was ~100nm. A strong correlation between topography and local photocurrent has been observed which is attributed to efficient photocarrier generation in intermediate-band solar cells. We found that this is due to the presence of photocarrier transfer from quantum dots to the InGaAs strain-compensated layer or to the GaAs spacer layer. Furthermore, a reduced local photocurrent was found right on top of the InAs quantum dot which has been explained by trapping of photo-generated electrons from the GaAs region by InAs quantum-dot states. The effect of the thickness of the GaAs spacer layer and the effect of Si-delta doping on topography and photocurrent distribution are also discussed.

Abstract: In this study, paraffin was selected as the phase change materials (PCMs) and rude-Palygorskite (Pal), rinsed-Pal, H+-Pal and organic-Pal were selected as porous materials. A series of paraffin/Pals composite PCMs were prepared by direct impregnation method without vacuuming. In the composite PCMs, up to 150wt% of paraffin could be loaded in H+-Pal. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) tests revealed that paraffin/ H+-Pal composite PCM had a melting temperature of 54–56°C and latent heat of 132.18Jg−1. In addition, the composite PCMs were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Good thermal stability was observed for composite PCMs by cycling test; we found that paraffin/H+-Pal composite PCM maintained ~95% of the initial latent heat after the cycling test. In conclusion, the impregnation of Pals with paraffin was a promising method for preparation of excellent PCM composites.

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, the synthesis of highly ordered niobium oxynitride microcones as an attractive class of materials for visible-light-driven water splitting. As revealed by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), photoelectrochemical and transient photocurrent measurements, the microcones showed enhanced performance (~1000% compared to mesoporous niobium oxide) as photoanodes for water splitting with remarkable stability and visible light activity.
