Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are important organelles involved in energy storage and expenditure. LD dynamics has been investigated using genome-wide image screening methods in yeast and other model organisms. For most studies, genes were identified using two-dimensional images with LD enlargement as readout. Due to imaging limitation, reduction of LD size is seldom explored. Here, we aim to set up a screen that specifically utilizes reduced LD size as the readout. To achieve this, a novel yeast screen is set up to quantitatively and systematically identify genes that regulate LD size through a three-dimensional imaging-based approach. Cidea which promotes LD fusion and growth in mammalian cells was overexpressed in a yeast knockout library to induce large LD formation. Next, an automated, high-throughput image analysis method that monitors LD size was utilized. With this screen, we identified twelve genes that reduced LD size when deleted. The effects of eight of these genes on LD size were further validated in fld1 null strain background. In addition, six genes were previously identified as LD-regulating genes. To conclude, this methodology represents a promising strategy to screen for players in LD size control in both yeast and mammalian cells to aid in the investigation of LD-associated metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of lipid metabolism. However, the miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism on long-chain (≥C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis in vertebrates remains largely unknown. Here, we address a potentially important role of miRNA-24 (miR-24) in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus. miR-24 showed significantly higher abundance in liver of rabbitfish reared in brackish water than in seawater for fish fed vegetable oil diets and in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells incubated with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) than the control group. Similar expression patterns were also observed on the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (srebp1) and LC-PUFA biosynthesis related genes. While opposite results were observed on the expression of insulin-induced gene 1 (insig1), an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein blocking Srebp1 proteolytic activation. Luciferase reporter assays revealed rabbitfish insig1 as a target of miR-24. Knockdown of miR-24 in SCHL cells resulted in increased Insig1 protein, and subsequently reduced mature Srebp1 protein and expression of genes required for LC-PUFA biosynthesis, and these effects could be attenuated after additional insig1 knockdown. Opposite results were observed with overexpression of miR-24. Moreover, increasing endogenous insig1 by knockdown of miR-24 inhibited Srebp1 processing and consequently suppressed LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish hepatocytes. These results indicate a potentially critical role for miR-24 in regulating LC-PUFA biosynthesis through the Insig1/Srebp1 pathway by targeting insig1. This is the first report of miR-24 involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis and thus may provide knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in vertebrates.

Abstract: Cisplatin is an important chemotherapeutic agent against metastatic bladder cancer, but resistance often limits its usage. With the recent recognition of lipid metabolic alterations in bladder cancers, we studied the metabolic implications of cisplatin resistance using cisplatin-sensitive (T24S) and resistant (T24R) bladder cancer cells. Real-time live metabolomics revealed that T24R cells consume more glucose, leading to higher production of glucose-derived acetate and fatty acids. Along with the activation of general metabolic regulators, enzymes involved in acetate usage (ACSS2) and fatty acid synthesis (ACC) and a precursor for fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA) were elevated in T24R cells. Consistently, metabolic analysis with 13C isotope revealed that T24R cells preferred glucose to acetate as the exogenous carbon source for the increased fatty acid synthesis, contrary to T24S cells. In addition, ACSS2, rather than the well-established ACLY, was the key enzyme that supplies acetyl-CoA in T24R cells through glucose-derived endogenous acetate. The relevance of ACSS2 in cisplatin resistance was further confirmed by the abrogation of resistance by an ACSS2 inhibitor and, finally, by the higher expression of ACSS2 in the patient tissues with cisplatin resistance. Our results may help improve the treatment options for chemoresistant bladder cancer patients and provide possible vulnerability targets to overcome the resistance.

Abstract: Lipid homeostasis is important for executing normal cellular functions and maintaining physiological conditions. The biophysical properties and intricate metabolic network of lipids underlie the coordinated regulation of different lipid species in lipid homeostasis. To reveal the homeostatic response among different lipids, we systematically knocked down 40 lipid metabolism genes in Drosophila S2 cells by RNAi and profiled the lipidomic changes. Clustering analyses of lipids reveal that many pairs of genes acting in a sequential fashion or sharing the same substrate are tightly clustered. Through a lipid-gene regulatory network analysis, we further found that a reduction of triacylglycerol (TAG) is associated with an increase of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) or a reduction of hexosyl-ceramide (HexCer) and hydroxylated hexosyl-ceramide (OH-HexCer). Importantly, negative coregulation between TAG and LPI/PI, and positive coregulation between TAG and HexCer, were also found in human Hela cells. Together, our results reveal coregulations of TAG with PI/LPI and with HexCer in lipid homeostasis.

DGAT1 deficiency disrupts lysosome function in enterocytes during dietary fat absorption,

Abstract: Enterocytes, the absorptive cells of the small intestine, mediate the process of dietary fat absorption by secreting triacylglycerol (TAG) into circulation. When levels of dietary fat are high, TAG is stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs) and sequentially hydrolyzed for ultimate secretion. Mice with deficiency in acyl CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1−/− mice) were previously reported to have a reduced rate of intestinal TAG secretion and abnormal TAG accumulation in enterocyte CLDs. This unique intestinal phenotype is critical to their resistance to diet-induced obesity; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Emerging evidence shows that lysosomal TAG hydrolysis contributes to autophagy-mediated CLD mobilization termed lipophagy, and when disrupted results in CLD accumulation. In order to study how lipophagy contributes to the unique intestinal phenotype of Dgat1−/− mice, enterocytes from wild-type (WT) and Dgat1−/− mice were examined at 2 and 6 h after oral oil gavage. Through ultrastructural analysis we observed TAG present within autophagic vesicles (AVs) in mouse enterocytes, suggesting the role of lipophagy in intestinal CLD mobilization during dietary fat absorption. Furthermore, we found that Dgat1−/− mice had abnormal TAG accumulation within AVs and less acidic lysosomes compared to WT mice. Together these findings suggest that the delayed dietary fat absorption seen in Dgat1−/− mice is, in part, due to the dysregulated flux of autophagy-mediated CLD mobilization and impairment of lysosomal acidification in enterocytes. The present study highlights the critical role of lysosome in enterocyte CLD mobilization for proper dietary fat absorption.

Abstract: Cholesterol, an essential lipid component of cellular plasma membranes, regulates fluidity, mechanical integrity, raft structure and may specifically interact with membrane proteins. Numerous effects on ion channels by cholesterol, including changes in current amplitude, voltage dependence and gating kinetics, have been reported. We have previously described such changes in the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 of lymphocytes by cholesterol and its analog 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC). In voltage-gated channels membrane depolarization induces movement of the voltage sensor domains (VSD), which is transmitted by a coupling mechanism to the pore domain (PD) to open the channel. Here, we investigated whether cholesterol effects were mediated by the VSD to the pore or the PD was the direct target. Specificity was tested by comparing Kv1.3 and Kv10.1 channels having different VSD-PD coupling mechanisms. Current recordings were performed with two-electrode voltage-clamp fluorometry, where movement of the VSDs was monitored by attaching fluorophores to external cysteine residues introduced in the channel sequence. Loading the membrane with cholesterol or 7DHC using methyl-β-cyclodextrin induced changes in the steady-state and kinetic parameters of the ionic currents while leaving fluorescence parameters mostly unaffected in both channels. Non-stationary noise analysis revealed that reduction of single channel conductance rather than that of open probability caused the observed current decrease. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning and stimulated emission depletion microscopy demonstrated significant changes in the distribution of these ion channels in response to sterol loading. Our results indicate that sterol-induced effects on ion channel gating directly target the pore and do not act via the VSD.

Abstract: Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is the main plasma carrier of triacylglycerol that is elevated in pathological conditions such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity and dyslipidemia. How variations in triacylglycerol levels influence structural stability and remodeling of VLDL and its metabolic product, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), is unknown. We applied a biochemical and biophysical approach using lipoprotein remodeling by lipoprotein lipase and cholesterol ester transfer protein, along with thermal denaturation that mimics key aspects of lipoprotein remodeling in vivo. The results revealed that increasing the triacylglycerol content in VLDL promotes changes in the lipoprotein size and release of the exchangeable apolipoproteins. Similarly, increased triacylglycerol content in LDL promotes lipoprotein remodeling and fusion. These effects were observed in single-donor lipoproteins from healthy subjects enriched in exogenous triolein, in single-donor lipoproteins from healthy subjects with naturally occurring differences in endogenous triacylglycerol, and in LDL and VLDL from pooled plasma of diabetic and normolipidemic patients. Consequently, triacylglycerol-induced destabilization is a general property of plasma lipoproteins. This destabilization reflects a direct effect of triacylglycerol on lipoproteins. Moreover, we show that TG can act indirectly by increasing lipoprotein susceptibility to oxidation and lipolysis and thereby promoting the generation of free fatty acids that augment fusion. These in vitro findings are relevant to lipoprotein remodeling and fusion in vivo. In fact, fusion of LDL and VLDL enhances their retention in the arterial wall and, according to the response-to-retention hypothesis, triggers atherosclerosis. Therefore, enhanced fusion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins suggests a new causative link between elevated plasma triacylglycerol and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Diatoms are eukaryotic microalgae that play a pivotal role in biological and geochemical marine cycles. These microorganisms are at the basis of the trophic chain and their lipids are essential components (e.g. eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) of aquatic food webs. Galactolipids are the primary lipid components of plastid membranes and form the largest lipid family of diatoms. As source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), these compounds are also involved in the synthesis of lipoxygenase (LOX) products such as non-volatile oxylipins and polyunsaturated aldehydes. Here, we report the first identification of two genes, namely PmLAH1 and PaLAH1, coding for lipolytic enzymes in two diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Functional and modeling studies evidence a patatin-like domain endowed with galactolipase and phospholipase activity at the C-terminus of both proteins. Homologues of Pseudo-nitzschia LAH1 genes were retrieved in other diatom species so far sequenced in agreement with conservation of the functional role of these proteins within the lineage.

Abstract: NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in Western diet–induced systemic inflammation and was recently shown to mediate long-lasting trained immunity in myeloid cells. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are sterile triggers able to induce the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, leading to IL-1β secretion while unsaturated ones (UFAs) prevent SFAs-mediated NLRP3 activation. Unlike previous studies using LPS-primed bone marrow derived macrophages, we do not see any ROS or IRE-1α involvement in SFAs-mediated NLRP3 activation in human monocytes-derived macrophages. Rather we show that SFAs need to enter the cells and to be activated into acyl-CoA to lead to NLRP3 activation in human macrophages. However, their β-oxidation is dispensable. Instead, they are channeled towards phospholipids but redirected towards lipid droplets containing triacylglycerol in the presence of UFAs. Lipidomic analyses and Laurdan fluorescence experiments demonstrate that SFAs induce a dramatic saturation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) correlated with a loss of membrane fluidity, both events inhibited by UFAs. The silencing of CCTα, the key enzyme in PC synthesis, prevents SFA-mediated NLRP3 activation, demonstrating the essential role of the de novo PC synthesis. This SFA-induced membrane remodeling promotes a disruption of the plasma membrane Na, K-ATPase, instigating a K+ efflux essential and sufficient for NLRP3 activation. This work opens novel therapeutic avenues to interfere with Western diet-associated diseases such as those targeting the glycerolipid pathway.

Abstract: Aims
Human plasma lipoproteins are known to contain various glycan structures whose composition and functional importance are starting to be recognized. We assessed N-glycosylation of human plasma HDL and LDL and the role of their glycomes in cellular cholesterol metabolism.
Methods
N-glycomic profiles of native and neuraminidase-treated HDL and LDL were obtained using HILIC-UHPLC-FLD. Relative abundance of the individual chromatographic peaks was quantitatively expressed as a percentage of total integrated area and N-glycan structures present in each peak were elucidated by MALDI-TOF MS. The capacity of HDL to mediate cellular efflux of cholesterol and the capacity of LDL to induce cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters were evaluated in THP-1 cells.
Results
HILIC-UHPLC-FLD analysis of HDL and LDL N-glycans released by PNGase F resulted in 22 and 18 distinct chromatographic peaks, respectively. The majority of N-glycans present in HDL (~70%) and LDL (~60%) were sialylated with one or two sialic acid residues. The most abundant N-glycan structure in both HDL and LDL was a complex type biantennary N-glycan with one sialic acid (A2G2S1). Relative abundances of several N-glycan structures were dramatically altered by the neuraminidase treatment, which selectively removed sialic acid residues. Native HDL displayed significantly greater efficacy in removing cellular cholesterol from THP-1 cells as compared to desialylated HDL (p < 0.05). Cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters in THP-1 cells was significantly higher after incubations with desialylated LDL particles as compared to native LDL (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
N-glycome of human plasma lipoproteins reveals a high level of diversity, which directly impacts functional properties of the lipoproteins.

Abstract: Human GLTP on chromosome 12 (locus 12q24.11) encodes a 24 kD amphitropic lipid transfer protein (GLTP) that mediates glycosphingolipid (GSL) intermembrane trafficking and regulates GSL homeostatic levels within cells. Herein, we provide evidence that GLTP overexpression inhibits the growth of human colon carcinoma cells (HT-29; HCT-116), but spares normal colonic cells (CCD-18Co). Mechanistic studies reveal that GLTP overexpression arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint via upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1B (Kip1/p27) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (Cip1/p21) at the protein and mRNA levels, and downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4), cyclin E and cyclin D1 protein levels. Assessment of the biological fate of HCT-116 cells overexpressing GLTP indicated no increase in cell death suggesting induction of quiescence. However, HT-29 cells overexpressing GLTP underwent cell death by necroptosis as revealed by phosphorylation of human mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL) via receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK-3), elevated cytosolic calcium, and plasma membrane permeabilization by pMLKL oligomerization. Overexpression of W96A-GLTP, an ablated GSL binding site mutant, failed to arrest the cell cycle or induce necroptosis. Sphingolipid assessment (ceramide, monohexosylceramide, sphingomyelin, ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate) of HT-29 cells overexpressing GLTP revealed large decreases (>5-fold) in sphingosine-1-phosphate with minimal change in 16:0-ceramide, tipping the ‘sphingolipid rheostat’ (S1P/16:0-Cer ratio) towards cell death. Depletion of RIPK-3 or MLKL abrogated necroptosis induced by GLTP overexpression. Our findings establish GLTP upregulation as a previously unknown suppressor of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells via interference with cell cycle progression and induction of necroptosis.

Abstract: Sterols are essential lipids, involved in many biological processes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the enzymes of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (Erg proteins) are localized in different cellular compartments. With the aim of studying organelle interactions, we discovered that Erg27p resides mainly in Lipid Droplets (LDs) in respiratory competent cells, while in absence of respiration, is found mostly in the ER. The results presented in this paper demonstrate an interplay between the mitochondrial respiration and ergosterol production: on the one hand, rho° cells show lower ergosterol content when compared with wild type respiratory competent cells, on the other hand, the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway influences the mitochondrial status, since treatment with ketoconazole, which blocks the ergosterol pathway, or the absence of the ERG27 gene, induced rho° production in S. cerevisiae. The loss of mitochondrial DNA in the ∆erg27 strain is fully suppressed by exogenous addition of ergosterol. These data suggest the notion that ergosterol is essential for maintaining the mitochondrial DNA attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Abstract: Phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)-induced depletion of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) transduces a plethora of signals into cellular responses. Importance and diversity of PI(4,5)P2-dependent processes led to strong need for biosensors of physiological PI(4,5)P2 dynamics applicable in live-cell experiments. Membrane PI(4,5)P2 can be monitored with fluorescently-labelled phosphoinositide (PI) binding domains that associate to the membrane depending on PI(4,5)P2 levels. The pleckstrin homology domain of PLCδ1 (PLCδ1-PH) and the C-terminus of tubby protein (tubbyCT) are two such sensors widely used to study PI(4,5)P2 signaling. However, certain limitations apply to both: PLCδ1-PH binds cytoplasmic inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) produced from PI(4,5)P2 through PLCβ, and tubbyCT responses do not faithfully report on PLCβ-dependent PI(4,5)P2 dynamics. In searching for an improved biosensor, we fused N-terminal homology domain of Epsin1 (ENTH) to GFP and examined use of this construct as genetically-encoded biosensor for PI(4,5)P2 dynamics in living cells. We utilized recombinant tools to manipulate PI or Gq protein-coupled receptors (GqPCR) to stimulate PLCβ signaling and characterized PI binding properties of ENTH-GFP with total internal reflection (TIRF) and confocal microscopy. ENTH-GFP specifically recognized membrane PI(4,5)P2 without interacting with IP3, as demonstrated by dialysis of cells with the messenger through a patch pipette. Utilizing Ci-VSP to titrate PI(4,5)P2 levels, we found that ENTH-GFP had low PI(4,5)P2 affinity. Accordingly, ENTH-GFP was highly sensitive to PLCβ-dependent PI(4,5)P2 depletion, and in contrast to PLCδ1-PH, overexpression of ENTH-GFP did not attenuate GqPCR signaling. Taken together, ENTH-GFP detects minute changes of PI(4,5)P2 levels and provides an important complementation of experimentally useful reporters of PI(4,5)P2 dynamics in physiological pathways.

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that some microRNAs participate in the regulation of growth and development of adipocytes. The present study shows that microRNA-425-5p (miR-425) is a novel strong regulator of adipogenesis and adipolysis in adipocytes. Forced expression of miR-425 in mice promoted body fat accumulation and the development of obesity due to high-fat intake, whereas silencing miR-425 prevented mice from being obese. Mechanically, the expression of miR-425 is controlled by PPARγ during the adipogenesis process in adipocytes. MiR-425 overexpression resulted in a reduction in the proliferation of 3t3-L1 pre-adipocytes but significantly accelerated cellular adipogenic differentiation. Mapk14, a negative regulator of adipogenesis, was predicted and confirmed as a real target gene of miR-425. Moreover, knocking down miR-425 remarkably intensified intracellular lipolysis and promoted lipid oxidation, which is related to the activation of AMPK, a monitor for intracellular energy balance. MiR-425 activated AMPK not only by decreasing cellular ATP concentrations but also by targeting the gene of Cab39, which is an upstream co-activator of AMPK.

Abstract: Several studies have identified a specific metabolic program that is associated with the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Whereas much is known about the association between glucose metabolism and EMT, the contribution of lipid metabolism is not still completely understood. Here, we studied epithelial and mesenchymal breast cancer cells by proteomic and lipidomic approaches and identified significant differences that characterised these models concerning specific metabolic enzymes and metabolites including fatty acids and phospholipids. Higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids together with increased expression of enzymes of de novo fatty acid synthesis is the distinct signature of epithelial with respect to mesenchymal cells that, on the contrary, show reduced lipogenesis, higher polyunsaturated fatty acids level and increased expression of genes involved in the triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and lipid droplets formation. In the mesenchymal model, the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-1 appears to be the major enzyme involved in TAG synthesis and inhibition of DGAT1, but not DGAT2, drastically reduces the incorporation of labeled palmitate into TAG. Moreover, knockdown of β-catenin demonstrated that this metabolic phenotype in under the control of a network of transcriptional factors and that β-catenin has a specific role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in mesenchymal cells.

Abstract: Introduction
Disturbances in onset and resolution of inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are incompletely understood. Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can be converted into lipid mediators here collectively named oxylipins. These include classical eicosanoids, but also pro-resolving mediators. A balanced production of pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving oxylipins is of importance for adequate inflammatory responses and subsequent return to homeostasis.
Objectives
Here we investigated if PUFA metabolism is disturbed in COPD patients.
Methods
Free PUFA and oxylipin levels were measured in induced sputum samples from the Bergen COPD cohort and COPD exacerbation study using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, effects of whole cigarette smoke on PUFA metabolism in air-liquid interface cultures of primary bronchial epithelial cells were assessed.
Results
Significantly lower levels of free alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were detected in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. During acute exacerbation (AE), levels of free arachidonic acid and docosapentaenoic acid were higher than in stable COPD patients. Furthermore, levels of omega-3 EPA- and docosahexaenoic acid-derived oxylipins were lower in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. Cyclooxygenase-2-converted mediators were mostly increased during AE. In vitro studies additionally showed that cigarette smoke exposure may also directly contribute to altered epithelial PUFA metabolism, and indirectly by causing airway epithelial remodelling.
Conclusions
Our findings show significant differences in PUFA metabolism in COPD patients compared to controls, further changed during AE. Airway epithelial remodelling may contribute to these changes. These findings provide new insight in impaired inflammatory resolution in COPD.

Abstract: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 27A1 is a key enzyme in both the acidic and neutral pathways of bile acid biosynthesis accepting cholesterol and ring-hydroxylated sterols as substrates introducing a (25R)26-hydroxy and ultimately a (25R)26-acid group to the sterol side-chain. In human, mutations in the CYP27A1 gene are the cause of the autosomal recessive disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Surprisingly, Cyp27a1 knockout mice (Cyp27a1−/−) do not present a CTX phenotype despite generating a similar global pattern of sterols. Using liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry and exploiting a charge-tagging approach for oxysterol analysis we identified over 50 cholesterol metabolites and precursors in the brain and circulation of Cyp27a1−/− mice. Notably, we identified (25R)26,7α- and (25S)26,7α-dihydroxy epimers of oxysterols and cholestenoic acids, indicating the presence of an additional sterol 26-hydroxylase in mouse. Importantly, our analysis also revealed elevated levels of 7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one, which we found increased the number of oculomotor neurons in primary mouse brain cultures. 7α-Hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one is a ligand for the pregnane X receptor (PXR), activation of which is known to up-regulate the expression of CYP3A11, which we confirm has sterol 26-hydroxylase activity. This can explain the formation of (25R)26,7α- and (25S)26,7α-dihydroxy epimers of oxysterols and cholestenoic acids; the acid with the former stereochemistry is a liver X receptor (LXR) ligand that increases the number of oculomotor neurons in primary brain cultures. We hereby suggest that a lack of a motor neuron phenotype in some CTX patients and Cyp27a1−/− mice may involve increased levels of 7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one and activation PXR, as well as increased levels of sterol 26-hydroxylase and the production of neuroprotective sterols capable of activating LXR.

Abstract: Lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) incorporate a fatty acid into the hydroxyl group of lysophospholipids (LPLs) and are critical for determining the fatty acid composition of phospholipids. Previous studies have focused mainly on their molecular identification and their substrate specificity regarding the polar head groups and acyl-CoAs. However, little is known about the positional specificity of the hydroxyl group of the glycerol backbone (sn-2 or sn-1) at which LPLATs introduce a fatty acid. This is mainly due to the instability of LPLs used as an acceptor, especially for LPLs with a fatty acid at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (sn-2-LPLs), which are essential for the enzymatic assay to determine the positional specificity. In this study, we established a method to determine the positional specificity of LPLAT by preparing stable sn-2-LPLs in combination with PLA2 digestion, and applied the method for determining the positional specificity of several LPLATs including LPCAT1, LYCAT and LPCAT3. We found that LPCAT1 introduced palmitic acid both at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of palmitoyl-LPC, while LYCAT and LPCAT3 specifically introduced stearic acid at the sn-1 position of LPG and arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position of LPC, respectively. The present method for evaluating the positional specificity could also be used for biochemical characterization of other LPLATs.

Abstract: Protein modification by arginylation regulates protein stability, function and interaction. The loss of arginylation disrupts a diverse set of fundamental cellular processes from proliferation to death. In the current study, role of arginylation in cell differentiation is investigated. Using in vitro preadipocyte differentiation model, it was observed that the inhibition or knockout (KO) of arginyltransferase 1 (ATE1) severely hindered differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Absence of arginylation inhibited expression of two key adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα, and their downstream adipogenic genes (FABP4, GLUT4, PLN1). Arginylation did not affect the induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, the up-stream regulators of PPARγ gene. However, absence of arginylation affected PPARγ protein expression, independent of its transcript level. The constitutive expression of PPARγ1 protein in Ate1 KO cells as well as ATE1 inhibitor treated wild type cells were dampened due to increased proteasome mediated degradation of PPARγ1 in the absence of arginylation in the cells. Taken together these observations suggested arginylation mediated transcriptional regulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα was downstream of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, and that the arginylation mediated regulation of PPARγ protein expression may play a role in this process. The inhibition of arginylation in mature adipocytes also reduced expression of lipogenesis genes and decreased fat accumulation in differentiated adipocytes. Thus, the current study shows that arginylation is essential for preadipocyte differentiation and maturation which are thought to be key factors in the maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: SND1 is a putative oncoprotein whose molecular function remains unclear. Its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma impairs cholesterol homeostasis due to the altered activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, which results in the accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters (CE). In this work, we explored whether high cholesterol synthesis and esterification originates changes in glycerolipid metabolism that might affect cell growth, given that acetyl-coenzyme A is required for cholesterogenesis and fatty acids (FA) are the substrates of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells show low triglyceride (TG) synthesis, but phospholipid biosynthesis or cell growth is not affected. Limited TG synthesis is not due to low acetyl-coenzyme A or NADPH availability. We demonstrate that the main factor limiting TG synthesis is the utilization of FAs for cholesterol esterification. These metabolic adaptations are linked to high Scd1 expression, needed for the de novo production of oleic acid, the main FA used by ACAT. We conclude that high cholesterogenesis due to SND1 overexpression might determine the channeling of FAs to CEs.

Paraoxonase 1 in endothelial cells impairs vasodilation induced by arachidonic acid lactone metabolite,

Abstract: Introduction
Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a high density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated lactonase, which is known for its antiatherogenic properties. Previous studies in PON1 knockout (PON1KO) mice revealed that PON1KO mice have low blood pressure, which is inversely correlated with the renal levels of the cytochrome P450 -derived arachidonic acid metabolite 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-EET). Our previous studies revealed that 5,6-EET is unstable, transforming to the δ-lactone isomer 5,6-δ-DHTL, an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) that mediates vasodilation, and it is a potential substrate for PON1.
Aim
To elucidate the role of PON1 in the modulation of vascular resistance via the regulation of the lactone-containing metabolite 5,6-δ-DHTL.
Results
In mouse resistance arteries, PON1 was found to be present and active in the endothelial layer. Vascular reactivity experiments revealed that 5,6-δ-DHTL dose-dependently dilates PON1KO mouse mesenteric arteries significantly more than wild type (w.t.) resistance arteries. Pre-incubation with HDL or rePON1 reduced 5,6-δ-DHTL-dependent vasodilation. FACS analyses and confocal microscopy experiments revealed that fluorescence-tagged rePON1 penetrates into human endothelial cells' (ECs') in both dose- and time- dependent manner, accumulate in the perinuclear compartment, and retains its lactonase activity in the cells. The presence of rePON1, but not the presence of PON1 loss-of-lactonase-activity mutant, reduced the Ca2+ influx in the ECs mediated by 5,6-δ-DHTL.
Conclusion
PON1 lactonase activity in the endothelium affects vascular dilation by regulating Ca2+ influx mediated by the lactone-containing EDHF 5,6-δ-DHTL.

Abstract: Liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) is the major fatty acid binding/”chaperone” protein in hepatic cytosol. Although fatty acids can be derived from the breakdown of dietary fat and glucose, relatively little is known regarding the impact of L-FABP on phenotype in the context of high dietary glucose. Potential impact was examined in wild-type (WT) and Lfabp gene ablated (LKO) female mice fed either a control or pair-fed high glucose diet (HGD). WT mice fed HGD alone exhibited decreased whole body weight gain and weight gain/kcal food consumed—both as reduced lean tissue mass (LTM) and fat tissue mass (FTM). Conversely, LKO alone increased weight gain, lean tissue mass, and fat tissue mass while decreasing serum β-hydroxybutyrate (indicative of hepatic fatty acid oxidation)—regardless of diet. Both LKO alone and HGD alone significantly altered the serum lipoprotein profile and increased triacylglycerol (TG), but in HGD mice the LKO did not further exacerbate serum TG content. HGD had little effect on hepatic lipid composition in WT mice, but prevented the LKO-induced selective increase in hepatic phospholipid, free-cholesterol and cholesteryl-ester. Taken together, these findings suggest that high glucose diet diminished the effects of LKO on the whole body and lipid phenotype of these mice.

Free fatty acid receptor 4-β-arrestin 2 pathway mediates the effects of different classes of unsaturated fatty acids in osteoclasts and osteoblasts,

Abstract: Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly remodelled by bone resorbing osteoclasts and bone forming osteoblasts, respectively. A breakdown in the remodelling process underlies several bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) have been shown to have beneficial effects on bone health. However, the mechanism of action of UFAs in bone remains unclear. Free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) is expressed in bone cells and preferentially binds ω−3 and ω−7 UFAs. Therefore, we sought to determine if FFAR4 influenced the action of different classes of UFAs in bone cells. FFAR4 and potential signalling pathways, β-arrestin 2 (βarr2) and Gαq, were silenced in RAW264.7 murine macrophages (pre-osteoclasts) and MC3T3-E1 murine pre-osteoblasts. Cell differentiation, activation of signalling pathways and expression of regulatory genes were evaluated. The ω−3 UFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and the ω−7 UFA, palmitoleic acid (PLA), were shown to require the FFAR4/βarr2 signalling pathway to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in RAW264.7 murine macrophages. The ω−6 UFA, arachidonic acid, and the ω−9 UFA, oleic acid (OA), were shown to inhibit osteoclast formation but did not use FFAR4. DHA, EPA, PLA and OA enhanced osteoblast signalling through the FFAR4/βarr2 signalling axis. This study reveals that FFAR4/βarr2 signalling may mediate the bone protective effects of different classes of UFAs in osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

The ORMs interact with transmembrane domain 1 of Lcb1 and regulate serine palmitoyltransferase oligomerization, activity and localization,

Abstract: Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), an endoplasmic reticulum-localized membrane enzymecomposed of acatalytic LCB1/LCB2 heterodimer and a small activating subunit (Tsc3 in yeast; ssSPTs in mammals), is negatively regulated by the evolutionarily conserved family of proteins known as the ORMs. In yeast, SPT, the ORMs, and the PI4P phosphatase Sac1, copurify in the “SPOTs” complex. However, neither the mechanism of ORM inhibition of SPT nor details of the interactions of the ORMs and Sac1 with SPT are known. Here we report that the first transmembrane domain (TMD1) of Lcb1 is required for ORM binding to SPT. Loss of binding is not due to altered membrane topology of Lcb1 since replacing TMD1 with a heterologous TMD restores membrane topology but not ORM binding. TMD1 deletion also eliminates ORM-dependent formation of SPT oligomers as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and in vivo imaging. Expression of ORMs lacking derepressive phosphorylation sites results in constitutive SPT oligomerization, while phosphomimetic ORMs fail to induce oligomerization under any conditions. Significantly, when LCB1–RFP and LCB1ΔTMD1–GFP were coexpressed, more LCB1ΔTMD1–GFP was in the peripheral ER, suggesting ORM regulation is partially accomplished by SPT redistribution. Tsc3 deletion does not abolish ORM inhibition of SPT, indicating the ORMs do not simply prevent activation by Tsc3. Binding of Sac1 to SPT requires Tsc3, but not the ORMs, and Sac1 does not influence ORM-mediated oligomerization of SPT. Finally, yeast mutants lacking ORM regulation of SPT require the LCB-P lyase Dpl1 to maintain long-chain bases at sublethal levels.

Abstract: Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), the remnants of very-low-density lipoproteins via lipolysis, are rich in cholesteryl ester and are associated with cardiovascular disease. Despite pharmacological interest in IDLs, their three-dimensional (3D) structure is still undetermined due to their variation in size, composition, and dynamic structure. To explore the 3D structure of IDLs, we reconstructed 3D density maps from individual IDL particles using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and individual-particle electron tomography (IPET, without averaging from different molecules). 3D reconstructions of IDLs revealed an unexpected polyhedral structure that deviates from the generally assumed spherical shape model (Frias et al., 2007; Olson, 1998; Shen et al., 1977). The polyhedral-shaped IDL contains a high-density shell formed by flat surfaces that are similar to those of very-low-density lipoproteins but have sharper dihedral angles between nearby surfaces. These flat surfaces would be less hydrophobic than the curved surface of mature spherical high-density lipoprotein (HDL), leading to a lower binding affinity of IDL to hydrophobic proteins (such as cholesteryl ester transfer protein) than HDL. This is the first visualization of the IDL 3D structure, which could provide fundamental clues for delineating the role of IDL in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Key homeostatic functions are regulated in a diurnal manner and a miss-alignment of such rhythms is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of several diseases. Signaling sphingolipids (SLs) in plasma such as sphingosine 1-phosphate control lymphocytic trafficking, vascular reactivity and platelet activity, physiological functions all of which display a diurnal rhythm themselves. However, the rhythmicity of SL metabolism in plasma and its potential causes have not been sufficiently investigated so far. Therefore, we analyzed blood of mice and healthy adult human subjects by targeted tandem mass-spectrometry at different time points. In order to investigate the influence of the synchronizing hormone melatonin, we compared melatonin proficient C3H/HeN wildtype mice (C3H) with melatonin receptor-1/2 double knockout mice (MT1/2−/−) and melatonin deficient C57BL/6J mice. We found a strong upregulation of plasma S1P with the beginning of the light period in C3H but not in MT1/2−/− or C57BL/6J mice. Accordingly, our study revealed an upregulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P d18:1) and sphinganine 1-phosphate (S1P d18:0) with the beginning of the light period in humans. Furthermore, plasma S1P d18:1 and S1P d18:0 were inversely correlated with the respective concentrations in platelets, pointing to a possible involvement of platelet SL metabolism. In humans, the diurnal rhythm of SLs was not associated with changes of SL-binding proteins or counts of cellular SL sources. Overall, this study indicates a physiological rhythmicity of plasma and platelet SL metabolism, likely mediated by melatonin, with potentially important implications for physiological diurnal rhythms and the regulation of SL metabolism and its functions.

Abstract: Leukotrienes (LT) are lipid mediators of the inflammatory response that play key roles in diseases such as asthma and atherosclerosis. The precursor leukotriene A4 (LTA4) is synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA) by 5‑lipoxygenase (5-LOX), a membrane-associated enzyme, with the help of 5‑lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP), a nuclear transmembrane protein. In lipoxygenases the main chain carboxylate of the C-terminus is a ligand for the non-heme iron and thus part of the catalytic center. We investigated the role of a lysine-rich sequence (KKK653–655) 20 amino acids upstream of the C-terminus unique to 5-LOX that might displace the main-chain carboxylate in the iron coordination sphere. A 5-LOX mutant in which KKK653–655 is replaced by ENL was transfected into HEK293 cells in the absence and presence of FLAP. This mutant gave ~20-fold higher 5-LOX product levels in stimulated HEK cells relative to the wild-type 5-LOX. Co-expression of the enzymes with FLAP led to an equalization of 5-LOX products detected, with wild-type 5-LOX product levels increased and those from the mutant enzyme decreased. These data suggest that the KKK motif limits 5-LOX activity and that this attenuated activity must be compensated by the presence of FLAP as a partner protein for effective LT biosynthesis.

A putative diol synthase from Penicillium oxalicum was found to convert palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), oleic acid (18:1n-9), linoleic acid (18:2n-6), and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) to 6S,8R-dihydroxy-9(Z)-hexadecenoic acid, 6R,8R-dihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid, 6R,8R-dihydroxy-9,12(Z,Z)-octadecadienoic acid, and 6S,8R-dihydroxy-9,12,15(Z,Z,Z)-octadecatrienoic acid, respectively, which were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyses. The specific activity and catalytic efficiency of P. oxalicum 6,8-diol synthase were the highest for 18:2n-6, indicating that the enzyme is a 6R,8R-linoleate diol synthase (6R,8R-LDS) with new regiospecificity. This is the first report of a 6R,8R-LDS. LDS is a fusion protein consisting of a dioxygenase domain at the N-terminus and a cytochrome P450/hydroperoxide isomerase (P450/HPI) domain at the C-terminus. The putative active-site residues in the C-terminal domain of P. oxalicum 6R,8R-LDS were proposed based on a substrate-docking homology model. The results of the site-directed mutagenesis within C-terminal P450 domain suggested that Asn886, Arg707, and Arg934, are catalytic importance and belong to the catalytic groove. Phe794 and Gln889 were found to be involved in the regiospecific rearrangement of hydroperoxide, while the F794E and Q889A variants of P. oxalicum 6,8-LDS acted as 7,8- and 8,11-LDSs, respectively. All these mutations critically affected the HPI activity of P. oxalicum 6R,8R-LDS.

Abstract: With obesity rates reaching epidemic proportions, more studies concentrated on reducing the risk and treating this epidemic are vital. Redox stress is an important metabolic regulator involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Oxygen and nitrogen-derived free radicals alter glucose and lipid homeostasis in key metabolic tissues, leading to increases in risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Oxidants derived from dietary fat differ in their metabolic regulation, with numerous studies showing benefits from a high omega 3 rich diet compared to the frequently consumed “western diet” rich in saturated fat. Omega 3 (OM3) fatty acids improve lipid profile, lower inflammation, and ameliorate insulin resistance, possibly through maintaining redox homeostasis. This study is based on the hypothesis that altering endogenous antioxidant production and/or increasing OM3 rich diet consumption will improve energy metabolism and maintain insulin sensitivity. We tested the comparative metabolic effects of a diet rich in saturated fat (HFD) and an omega 3-enriched diet (OM3) in the newly developed ‘stress-less’ mice model that overexpresses the endogenous antioxidant catalase. Eight weeks of dietary intervention showed that mice overexpressing endogenous catalase compared to their wild-type controls when fed an OM3 enriched diet, in contrast to HFD, activated GPR120-Nrf2 cross-talk to maintain balanced energy metabolism, normal circadian rhythm, and insulin sensitivity. These findings suggest that redox regulation of GPR120/FFAR4 might be an important target in reducing risk of metabolic syndrome and associated diseases.

Abstract: Pain is one of the cardinal signs of inflammation and is present in many inflammatory conditions. Therefore, anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs also have analgesic properties. We previously showed that prostaglandin D2-glycerol ester (PGD2-G), endogenously produced by cyclooxygenase-2 from the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, has anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo that are partly mediated by DP1 receptor activation. In this work, we investigated its effect in a model of carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain. PGD2-G decreased hyperalgesia and edema, leading to a faster recovery. Moreover, PGD2-G decreased carrageenan-induced inflammatory markers in the paw as well as inflammatory cell recruitment. The effects of PGD2-G were independent from metabolite formation (PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2-G) or DP1 receptor activation in this model. Indeed PGD2 delayed recovery from hyperalgesia while 15d-PGJ2-G worsened the edema. However, while PGD2-G decreased hyperalgesia in this model of inflammatory pain, it had no effect when tested in the capsaicin-induced pain model. While the targets mediating the effects of this bioactive lipid in inflammatory pain remain to be elucidated, our findings further support the interest of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators in the management of inflammatory pain.

Abstract: Bile acids exhibit strong antimicrobial activity as natural detergents, and are involved in lipid digestion and absorption. We investigated the mechanism of bile acid adaptation in Lactobacillus gasseri JCM1131T. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of cholic acid (CA), a major bile acid in humans, resulted in development of resistance to otherwise-lethal concentrations of CA by this intestinal lactic acid bacterium. As this adaptation was accompanied by decreased cell-membrane damage, we analyzed the membrane lipid composition of L. gasseri. Although there was no difference in the proportions of glycolipids (~70%) and phospholipids (~20%), adaptation resulted in an increased abundance of long-sugar-chain glycolipids and a 100% increase in cardiolipin (CL) content (to ~50% of phospholipids) at the expense of phosphatidylglycerol (PG). In model vesicles, the resistance of PG vesicles to solubilization by CA increased with increasing CL/PG ratio. Deletion of the two putative CL synthase genes, the products of which are responsible for CL synthesis from PG, decreased the CL content of the mutants, but did not affect their ability to adapt to CA. Exposure to CA restored the CL content of the two single-deletion mutants, likely due to the activities of the remaining CL synthase. In contrast, the CL content of the double-deletion mutant was not restored, and the lipid composition was modified such that PG predominated (~45% of total lipids) at the expense of glycolipids. Therefore, CL plays important roles in bile acid resistance and maintenance of the membrane lipid composition in L. gasseri.

Apolipoprotein D overexpression alters hepatic prostaglandin and omega fatty acid metabolism during the development of a non-inflammatory hepatic steatosis,

Abstract: Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a secreted lipocalin associated with neuroprotection and lipid metabolism. Overexpression of ApoD in mouse neural tissue induces the development of a non-inflammatory hepatic steatosis in 12-month-old transgenic animals. Previous data indicates that accumulation of arachidonic acid, ApoD's preferential ligand, and overactivation of PPARγ are likely the driving forces in the development of the pathology. However, the lack of inflammation under those conditions is surprising. Hence, we further investigated the apparent repression of inflammation during hepatic steatosis development in aging transgenic animals. The earliest modulation of lipid metabolism and inflammation occurred at 6 months with a transient overexpression of L-PGDS and concomitant overproduction of 15d-PGJ2, a PPARγ agonist. Hepatic lipid accumulation was detectable as soon as 9 months. Inflammatory polarization balance varied in time, with a robust anti-inflammatory profile at 6 months coinciding with 15d-PGJ2 overproduction. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were preferentially stored in the liver of 12-month-old transgenic mice and resulted in a higher omega-3/omega-6 ratio compared to wild type mice of the same age. Thus, inflammation seems to be controlled by several mechanisms in the liver of transgenic mice: first by an increase in 15d-PGJ2 production and later by a beneficial omega-3/omega-6 ratio. PPARγ seems to play important roles in these processes. The accumulation of several omega fatty acids species in the transgenic mouse liver suggests that ApoD might bind to a broader range of fatty acids than previously thought.

Abstract: Background
Natural killer T (NKT) cells in adipose tissue (AT) contribute to whole body energy homeostasis.
Results
Inhibition of the glucosylceramide synthesis in adipocytes impairs iNKT cell activity.
Conclusion
Glucosylceramide biosynthesis pathway is important for endogenous lipid antigen activation of iNKT cells in adipocytes.
Significance
Unraveling adipocyte-iNKT cell communication may help to fight obesity-induced AT dysfunction. Overproduction and/or accumulation of ceramide and ceramide metabolites, including glucosylceramides, can lead to insulin resistance. However, glucosylceramides also fulfill important physiological functions. They are presented by antigen presenting cells (APC) as endogenous lipid antigens via CD1d to activate a unique lymphocyte subspecies, the CD1d-restricted invariant (i) natural killer T (NKT) cells. Recently, adipocytes have emerged as lipid APC that can activate adipose tissue-resident iNKT cells and thereby contribute to whole body energy homeostasis. Here we investigate the role of the glucosylceramide biosynthesis pathway in the activation of iNKT cells by adipocytes. UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (Ugcg), the first rate limiting step in the glucosylceramide biosynthesis pathway, was inhibited via chemical compounds and shRNA knockdown in vivo and in vitro. β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase (B4Galt) 5 and 6, enzymes that convert glucosylceramides into potentially inactive lactosylceramides, were subjected to shRNA knock down. Subsequently, (pre)adipocyte cell lines were tested in co-culture experiments with iNKT cells (IFNγ and IL4 secretion). Inhibition of Ugcg activity shows that it regulates presentation of a considerable fraction of lipid self-antigens in adipocytes. Furthermore, reduced expression levels of either B4Galt5 or -6, indicate that B4Galt5 is dominant in the production of cellular lactosylceramides, but that inhibition of either enzyme results in increased iNKT cell activation. Additionally, in vivo inhibition of Ugcg by the aminosugar AMP-DNM results in decreased iNKT cell effector function in adipose tissue. Inhibition of endogenous glucosylceramide production results in decreased iNKT cells activity and cytokine production, underscoring the role of this biosynthetic pathway in lipid self-antigen presentation by adipocytes.

Abstract: Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) deficiency is a rare and severe peroxisomal leukodystrophy associated with a very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) β–oxidation defect. This neurodegenerative disease lacks relevant cell models to further decipher the pathomechanisms in order to identify novel therapeutic targets. Since peroxisomal defects in microglia appear to be a key component of peroxisomal leukodystrophies, we targeted the Acox1 gene in the murine microglial BV-2 cell line. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we generated an Acox1-deficient cell line and validated the allelic mutations, which lead to the absence of ACOX1 protein and enzymatic activity. The activity of catalase, the enzyme degrading H2O2, was increased, likely in response to the alteration of redox homeostasis. The mutant cell line grew more slowly than control cells without obvious morphological changes. However, ultrastructural analysis revealed an increased number of peroxisomes and mitochondria associated with size reduction of mitochondria. Changes in the distribution of lipid droplets containing neutral lipids have been observed in mutant cells; lipid analysis revealed the accumulation of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFA. Besides, expression levels of genes encoding interleukin-1 beta and 6 (IL-1β and IL-6), as well as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) were found modified in the mutant cells suggesting modification of microglial polarization and phagocytosis ability. In summary, this Acox1-deficient cell line presents the main biochemical characteristics of the human disease and will serve as a promising model to further investigate the consequences of a specific microglial peroxisomal β–oxidation defect on oxidative stress, inflammation and cellular functions.

GD3 ganglioside-enriched extracellular vesicles stimulate melanocyte migration,

Abstract: Melanomas often accumulate gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids found in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes, as disialoganglioside GD3 and its derivatives. Here, we have transfected the GD3 synthase gene (ST8Sia I) in a normal melanocyte cell line in order to evaluate changes in the biological behavior of non-transformed cells. GD3-synthase expressing cells converted GM3 into GD3 and accumulated both GD3 and its acetylated form, 9-O-acetyl-GD3. Melanocytes were rendered more migratory on laminin-1 surfaces. Cell migration studies using the different transfectants, either treated or not with the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor d-1-threo-1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (PPPP), allowed us to show that while GM3 is a negative regulator of melanocyte migration, GD3 increases it. We showed that gangliosides were shed to the matrix by migrating cells and that GD3 synthase transfected cells shed extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in GD3. EVs enriched in GD3 stimulated cell migration of GD3 negative cells, as observed in time lapse microscopy studies. Otherwise, EVs shed by GM3+veGD3−ve cells impaired migration and diminished cell velocity in cells overexpressing GD3. The balance of antimigratory GM3 and promigratory GD3 gangliosides in melanocytes could be altered not only by the overexpression of enzymes such as ST8Sia I, but also by the horizontal transfer of ganglioside enriched extracellular vesicles. This study highlights that extracellular vesicles transfer biological information also through their membrane components, which include a variety of glycosphingolipids remodeled in disease states such as cancer.

Common binding sites for cholesterol and neurosteroids on a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel,

Abstract: Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes, and is required for mammalian pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) function. Computational studies suggest direct interactions between cholesterol and pLGICs but experimental evidence identifying specific binding sites is limited. In this study, we mapped cholesterol binding to Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a model pLGIC chosen for its high level of expression, existing crystal structure, and previous use as a prototypic pLGIC. Using two cholesterol analogue photolabeling reagents with the photoreactive moiety on opposite ends of the sterol, we identified two cholesterol binding sites: an intersubunit site between TM3 and TM1 of adjacent subunits and an intrasubunit site between TM1 and TM4. In both the inter- and intrasubunit sites, cholesterol is oriented such that the 3‑OH group points toward the center of the transmembrane domains rather than toward either the cytosolic or extracellular surfaces. We then compared this binding to that of the cholesterol metabolite, allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that allosterically modulates pLGICs. The same binding pockets were identified for allopregnanolone and cholesterol, but the binding orientation of the two ligands was markedly different, with the 3‑OH group of allopregnanolone pointing to the intra- and extracellular termini of the transmembrane domains rather than to their centers. We also found that cholesterol increases, whereas allopregnanolone decreases the thermal stability of GLIC. These data indicate that cholesterol and neurosteroids bind to common hydrophobic pockets in the model pLGIC, GLIC, but that their effects depend on the orientation and specific molecular interactions unique to each sterol.

Maternal eicosapentaenoic acid feeding promotes placental angiogenesis through a Sirtuin-1 independent inflammatory pathway,

Abstract: Maternal overnutrition or obesity is associated with a wide range of metabolic disorders and may impair placental angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) promote fetal growth in both rodents and humans. Whether n-3 PUFA impacts on placental angiogenesis in vivo remains unclear. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a protein deacetylase that plays an important role in regulating inflammation and endothelial function. Little information is available on a putative role of SIRT1 in placental angiogenesis. The goal of this study was to examine the capability of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to regulate angiogenesis and inflammation in SIRT1-deficient placentas. In the present study, male and female SIRT1+/− mice were mated overnight, then primiparous SIRT1+/− mice were fed a 60% kcal HFD or equienergy EPA diet (4.4% EPA-ethyl ester). We found that the EPA diet significantly improved maternal insulin sensitivity and decreased plasma levels of inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNFα concentration. Moreover, EPA treatment promoted fetus growth and placental angiogenesis, and inhibited the hypoxia inducible factor-1α(HIF1α) pathway. SIRT1 deficiency exhibited an opposite effect, leading to decrease in placental angiogenesis and fetal weight. No significant effect was observed between diet and genotype. Here, we reported for the first time that EPA treatment increased the expression of placental inflammatory genes and promoted translocation of NFκB into the nucleus. On the contrary, SIRT1-deficient placentas showed a decreased inflammation state. Together, these data demonstrate a previously unknown role of EPA to promote placental angiogenesis through a SIRT1 independent inflammatory pathway.

Abstract: This study was conducted to understand the effect of high-fat diet challenge on lipid transport and endoplasmic reticulum stress in blunt snout bream. Ninety fish (average weight: 41.84 ± 0.07 g) were randomly fed a control diet (6% fat) or a high-fat diet (11% fat) for 9 weeks. The growth performance and feed utilization efficiency were evaluated at the end of the trial. The liver samples of both groups were harvested for molecular analysis and histological evaluation. Compared to the Control group, the high-fat diet group showed no effects on either growth performance or energy intake in blunt snout bream. However, high-fat diet resulted in a massive accumulation of lipid and pathological structural alternations, and disrupted expression of lipid transport-related genes and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of the fish. In vitro, after exposure of the isolated primary hepatocytes from blunt snout bream to oleic acid, the cells showed increased intracellular TG accumulation, decreased VLDL secretion, which was attributed to altered expression levels of lipid transport-related genes through the activated IRE1/XBP1 signaling. The oleic acid-induced detrimental effects were alleviated by co-incubating the cells with an IER1 inhibitor, 4μ8c. In conclusion, high-fat diet could lead to aberrant lipid secretion by activating the ER stress-associated IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Inhibiting the activity of IRE1 represents a promising target to rescue the side-effects of high-fat diet on the liver function of blunt snout bream.

Abstract: Caffeine intake is associated with a reduced risk developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. We report here that caffeine markedly improved high fat diet-induced NAFLD in mice resulting in a 10-fold increase in circulating IL-6 levels, leading to STAT3 activation in the liver. Interestingly, the expression of IL-6 mRNA was not increased in the liver, but increased substantially in the muscles of caffeine-treated mice. Caffeine was found to stimulate IL-6 production in cultured myotubes but not in hepatocytes, adipocytes, or macrophages. The inhibition of p38/MAPK abrogated caffeine-induced IL-6 production in muscle cells. Caffeine failed to improve NAFLD in IL-6 and hepatocyte-specific STAT3 knockout mice, indicating that the IL-6/STAT3 pathway is vital for the hepatoprotective effects of caffeine in NAFLD. The possibility that IL-6/STAT3-mediated hepatic autophagosome induction and hepatocytic oxygen consumption are involved in the anti-NAFLD effects of caffeine cannot be excluded, based on the findings presented here. Our results reveal that caffeine ameliorates NAFLD via crosstalk between muscle IL-6 production and liver STAT3 activation.
