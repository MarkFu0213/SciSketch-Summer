Abstract: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasingly common condition characterized by progressive loss of functional nephrons leading to renal failure. TGF-β1-induced mesangial cell (MC) phenotype alterations have been linked to the genesis of CKD. Here we show that TGF-β1 regulates TBX3 gene expression in MC. This gene encodes for two main isoforms, TBX3.1 and TBX3+2α. TBX3.1 has been implicated in cell immortalization, proliferation and apoptosis by inhibiting p14ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway, while TBX3+2α role has not been defined. We demonstrated that TBX3 overexpression abrogated MC apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Moreover, we observed an enhancement in TBX3 protein expression both in glomerular and tubular regions in the model of 5/6 nephrectomy, temporally related to increased expression of TGF-β1, type IV collagen and fibronectin. Our results indicate that TBX3 acts as an anti-apoptotic factor in MC in vitro and may be involved in the mechanism by which TGF-β1 induces glomerulosclerosis and tubular fibrosis during the progression of nephropathies.

Abstract: Summary
Plants detect microbes via two functionally interconnected tiers of immune receptors. Immune detection is suppressed by equally complex pathogen mechanisms. The small plasma-membrane-tethered protein RIN4 negatively regulates microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered responses, which are derepressed upon bacterial flagellin perception. We demonstrate that recognition of the flagellin peptide MAMP flg22 triggers accumulation of RIN4 phosphorylated at serine 141 (pS141) that mediates derepression of several immune outputs. RIN4 is targeted by four bacterial type III effector proteins, delivered temporally after flagellin perception. Of these, AvrB acts with a host kinase to increase levels of RIN4 phosphorylated at threonine 166 (pT166). RIN4 pT166 is epistatic to RIN4 pS141. Thus, AvrB contributes to virulence by enhancing “rerepression” of immune system outputs. Our results explain the evolution of independent effectors that antagonize accumulation of RIN4 pS141 and of a specific plant intracellular NLR protein, RPM1, which is activated by AvrB-mediated accumulation of RIN4 pT166.

Abstract: Summary
The recently reported Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is phylogenetically closely related to the bat coronaviruses (BatCoVs) HKU4 and HKU5. However, the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV is still unclear. A receptor binding domain (RBD) in the MERS-CoV envelope-embedded spike protein specifically engages human CD26 (hCD26) to initiate viral entry. The high sequence identity in the viral spike protein prompted us to investigate if HKU4 and HKU5 can recognize hCD26 for cell entry. We found that HKU4-RBD, but not HKU5-RBD, binds to hCD26, and pseudotyped viruses embedding HKU4 spike can infect cells via hCD26 recognition. The structure of the HKU4-RBD/hCD26 complex revealed a hCD26-binding mode similar overall to that observed for MERS-RBD. HKU4-RBD, however, is less adapted to hCD26 than MERS-RBD, explaining its lower affinity for receptor binding. Our findings support a bat origin for MERS-CoV and indicate the need for surveillance of HKU4-related viruses in bats.

Abstract: As a super-antigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) stimulates the release of massive inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) which are documented to implicate osteoblast differentiation. In the present study, SEC2 was found to significantly improve the osteoblast differentiation by up-regulating BMP2 and Runx2/Cbfa1 expression. Interferon (IFN)-inducible gene IFI16, a co-activator of Runx2/Cbfa1, was also activated by SEC2 in the osteoblast differentiation. In addition, exogenous introduction of SEC2 stimulated OPG expression and suppressed RANKL, suggesting suppression of osteoclastogenesis in hMSCs. Therefore, our results displayed that SEC2 plays an important role in the commitment of MSC to the osteoblast and it might be a potential new therapeutic candidate for bone regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Distinct integration patterns of different retroviruses, including HIV-1, have puzzled virologists for over 20 years. A tetramer of the viral integrase (IN) assembles on the two viral cDNA ends, docks onto the target DNA (tDNA), and catalyzes viral genome insertion into the host chromatin. We identified the amino acids in HIV-1 IN that directly contact tDNA bases and affect local integration site sequence selection. These residues also determine the propensity of the virus to integrate into flexible tDNA sequences. Remarkably, natural polymorphisms INS119G and INR231G retarget viral integration away from gene-dense regions. Precisely these variants were associated with rapid disease progression in a chronic HIV-1 subtype C infection cohort. These findings link integration site selection to virulence and viral evolution, but also to the host immune response and antiretroviral therapy, since HIV-1 IN119 is under selection by HLA alleles and integrase inhibitors.

Abstract: Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), e.g. toll receptors (TLRs) that bind ligands within the microbiome have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer. LPS is a ligand for two TLR family members, TLR4 and RP105 which mediate LPS signaling in B cell proliferation and migration. Although LPS/TLR/RP105 signaling is well-studied; our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling these PRR signaling pathways remains incomplete. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for PTEN/PI-3K signaling in B cell selection and survival, however a role for PTEN/PI-3K in TLR4/RP105/LPS signaling in the B cell compartment has not been reported. Herein, we crossed a CD19cre and PTENfl/fl mouse to generate a conditional PTEN knockout mouse in the CD19+ B cell compartment. These mice were further crossed with an IL-14α transgenic mouse to study the combined effect of PTEN deletion, PI-3K inhibition and expression of IL-14α (a cytokine originally identified as a B cell growth factor) in CD19+ B cell lymphoproliferation and response to LPS stimulation. Targeted deletion of PTEN and directed expression of IL-14α in the CD19+ B cell compartment (IL-14+PTEN-/-) lead to marked splenomegaly and altered spleen morphology at baseline due to expansion of marginal zone B cells, a phenotype that was exaggerated by treatment with the B cell mitogen and TLR4/RP105 ligand, LPS. Moreover, LPS stimulation of CD19+ cells isolated from these mice display increased proliferation, augmented AKT and NFκB activation as well as increased expression of c-myc and cyclinD1. Interestingly, treatment of LPS treated IL-14+PTEN-/- mice with a pan PI-3K inhibitor, SF1126, reduced splenomegaly, cell proliferation, c-myc and cyclin D1 expression in the CD19+ B cell compartment and normalized the splenic histopathologic architecture. These findings provide the direct evidence that PTEN and PI-3K inhibitors control TLR4/RP105/LPS signaling in the CD19+ B cell compartment and that pan PI-3 kinase inhibitors reverse the lymphoproliferative phenotype in vivo.

Abstract: Post-translational regulation plays a critical role in the control of cell growth and proliferation. The phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is the most important post-translational modification. The function of PPARγ phosphorylation has been studied extensively in the past. However, the relationship between phosphorylated PPARγ1 and tumors remains unclear. Here we investigated the role of PPARγ1 phosphorylation in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line. Using the nonphosphorylation (Ser84 to alanine, S84A) and phosphorylation (Ser84 to aspartic acid, S84D) mutant of PPARγ1, the results suggested that phosphorylation attenuated PPARγ1 transcriptional activity. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that phosphorylated PPARγ1 promoted HT1080 cell proliferation and this effect was dependent on the regulation of cell cycle arrest. The mRNA levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 descended in PPARγ1S84D stable HT1080 cell, whereas the expression of p18INK4C was not changed. Moreover, compared to the PPARγ1S84A, PPARγ1S84D up-regulated the expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin A. Finally, PPARγ1 phosphorylation reduced sensitivity to agonist rosiglitazone and increased resistance to anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in HT1080 cell. Our findings establish PPARγ1 phosphorylation as a critical event in human fibrosarcoma growth. These findings raise the possibility that chemical compounds that prevent the phosphorylation of PPARγ1 could act as anticancer drugs.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr enhances infection of primary macrophages through unknown mechanisms. Recent studies demonstrated that Vpr interactions with the cellular DCAF1-DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex limit activation of innate immunity and interferon (IFN) induction. We describe a restriction mechanism that targets the HIV-1 envelope protein Env, but is overcome by Vpr and its interaction with DCAF1. This restriction is active in the absence of Vpr in HIV-1-infected primary macrophages and macrophage-epithelial cell heterokaryons, but not epithelial cell lines. HIV-1-infected macrophages lacking Vpr express more IFN following infection, target Env for lysosomal degradation, and produce fewer Env-containing virions. Conversely, Vpr expression reduces IFN induction, rescues Env expression, and enhances virion release. Addition of IFN or silencing DCAF1 reduces the amount of cell-associated Env and virion production in wild-type HIV-1-infected primary macrophages. These findings provide insight into an IFN-stimulated macrophage-specific restriction pathway targeting HIV-1 Env that is counteracted by Vpr.

Abstract: We investigated the association between circulating levels of 60 and 70 kDa heat-shock proteins (HSP60 and 70) and cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women with or without metabolic syndrome (MetS). This cross-sectional study included 311 Brazilian women (age ≥45 years with amenorrhea ≥12 months). Women showing three or more of the following diagnostic criteria were diagnosed with MetS: waist circumference (WC) ≥88 cm, blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg, triglycerides ≥150 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <50 mg/dl, and glucose ≥100 mg/dl. Clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters were collected. HSP60, HSP70, antibodies to HSP60 and HSP70, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured in serum. Student's t test, Kruskal–Wallis test, chi-square test, and Pearson correlation were used for statistical analysis. Of the 311 women, 30.9 % (96/311) were diagnosed with MetS. These women were, on average, obese with abdominal fat deposition and had lower HDL values as well as higher triglycerides and glucose levels. Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistant (HOMA-IR) test values in these women were compatible with insulin resistance (P < 0.05). CRP and HSP60 concentrations were higher in women with MetS than in women without MetS (P < 0.05). HSP60, anti-HSP70, and CRP concentrations increased with the number of features indicative of MetS (P < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between anti-HSP70 and WC, blood pressure and HOMA-IR, and between CRP and WC, blood pressure, glucose, HOMA-IR, and triglycerides (P < 0.05). In postmenopausal women, serum HSP60 and anti-HSP70 concentrations increased with accumulating features of the metabolic syndrome. These results suggest a greater immune activation that is associated with cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
In the absence of pathogen infection, plant effector-triggered immune (ETI) receptors are maintained in a preactivation state by intermolecular interactions with other host proteins. Pathogen effector-induced alterations activate the receptor. In Arabidopsis, the ETI receptor RPM1 is activated via bacterial effector AvrB-induced phosphorylation of the RPM1-interacting protein RIN4 at Threonine 166. We find that RIN4 also interacts with the prolyl-peptidyl isomerase (PPIase) ROC1, which is reduced upon RIN4 Thr166 phosphorylation. ROC1 suppresses RPM1 immunity in a PPIase-dependent manner. Consistent with this, RIN4 Pro149 undergoes cis/trans isomerization in the presence of ROC1. While the RIN4P149V mutation abolishes RPM1 resistance, the deletion of Pro149 leads to RPM1 activation in the absence of RIN4 phosphorylation. These results support a model in which RPM1 directly senses conformational changes in RIN4 surrounding Pro149 that is controlled by ROC1. RIN4 Thr166 phosphorylation indirectly regulates RPM1 resistance by modulating the ROC1-mediated RIN4 isomerization.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated whether gastric cancer with hypoxia-induced resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) could be re-sensitized following treatment with low-dose dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of the glycolytic pathway. The expression profiles of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1) were analyzed in tissues from 10 patients with gastric cancer who had different responses to adjuvant 5-FU treatment. For the in vitro assays, cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated with and without treatment with 20mM DCA in the AGS and MKN45 cell lines, as well as in PDK1 knockdown cell lines. The expression levels of HIF-1α and PDK-1 were both elevated in the tumor tissues relative to the normal gastric tissues of most patients who showed recurrence after adjuvant 5-FU treatment. Cellular viability tests showed that these cell lines had a lower sensitivity to 5-FU under hypoxic conditions compared to normoxic conditions. Moreover, the addition of 20mM DCA only increased the sensitivity of these cells to 5-FU under hypoxic conditions, and the resistance to 5-FU under hypoxia was also attenuated in PDK1 knockdown cell lines. In conclusion, DCA treatment was able to re-sensitize gastric cancer cells with hypoxia-induced resistance to 5-FU through the alteration of glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The gut mucosal epithelium separates the host from the microbiota, but enteropathogens such as Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm) can invade and breach this barrier. Defenses against such acute insults remain incompletely understood. Using a murine model of Salmonella enterocolitis, we analyzed mechanisms limiting pathogen loads in the epithelium during early infection. Although the epithelium-invading S.Tm replicate initially, this intraepithelial replicative niche is restricted by expulsion of infected enterocytes into the lumen. This mechanism is compromised if inflammasome components (NAIP1-6, NLRC4, caspase-1/-11) are deleted, or ablated specifically in the epithelium, resulting in ∼100-fold higher intraepithelial loads and accelerated lymph node colonization. Interestingly, the cytokines downstream of inflammasome activation, interleukin (IL)-1α/β and IL-18, appear dispensable for epithelial restriction of early infection. These data establish the role of an epithelium-intrinsic inflammasome, which drives expulsion of infected cells to restrict the pathogen’s intraepithelial proliferation. This may represent a general defense mechanism against mucosal infections.

Abstract: Alternative splicing is an important mechanism that can disrupt cell cycle control resulting in tumorigenesis. Although many alterations of Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) signaling are reported in cancers, the role of splice aberrations in destabilizing this signaling is the least understood mechanism. In this study, we compared TGFBR2 alternative splicing events in potentially malignant oral disorders (PMDs) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) samples with those in normal samples. Interestingly, there were five alternatively spliced forms of TGFBR2 with a deficient kinase domain in OSCCs. The TGFBR2 aberrant splicing was tumor-specific, suggesting that selective splicing out of TGFBR2 kinase domain could be a mechanism misused by cancer cells for evading TGFβ signaling–mediated anti-tumor activities. Moreover, these aberrant transcripts were present in PMDs as well, suggesting an early occurrence of these events during oral carcinogenesis and offering the possibility of early diagnosis of malignancy. Furthermore, OSCC patients who harbored these aberrantly spliced transcripts exhibited poor disease free survival (p=0.028) and poor overall survival (p=0.013). Thus, assessing the presence of these TGFBR2 transcripts can serve as a prognostic marker for oral cancer.

Abstract: Summary
New neurons generated by the neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult hippocampus play an important role in emotional regulation and respond to the action of antidepressants. Depression is a common and serious side effect of interferon-α (IFN-α), which limits its use as an antiviral and antitumor drug. However, the mechanism(s) underlying IFN-induced depression are largely unknown. Using a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests, we found that mice subjected to IFN-α treatment exhibited a depression-like phenotype. IFN-α directly suppressed NSC proliferation, resulting in the reduced generation of new neurons. Brain-specific mouse knockout of the IFN-α receptor prevented IFN-α-induced depressive behavioral phenotypes and the inhibition of neurogenesis, suggesting that IFN-α suppresses hippocampal neurogenesis and induces depression via its receptor in the brain. These findings provide insight for understanding the neuropathology underlying IFN-α-induced depression and for developing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of IFN-α-induced depressive effects.

Abstract: Sialoglycoproteins make a significant contribution to the negative charge of the glomerular anionic glycocalyx—crucial for efficient functioning of the glomerular permselective barrier. Defects in sialylation have serious consequences on podocyte function leading to the development of proteinuria. The aim of the current study was to investigate potential mechanisms underlying puromycin aminonucleosisde (PAN)-induced desialylation and to ascertain whether they could be corrected by administration of free sialic acid. PAN treatment of podocytes resulted in a loss of sialic acid from podocyte proteins. This was accompanied by a reduction, in the expression of sialyltransferases and a decrease in the key enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE). PAN treatment also attenuated expression of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (mSOD) and concomitantly increased the generation of superoxide anions. Sialic acid supplementation rescued podocyte protein sialylation and partially restored expression of sialyltransferases. Sialic acid also restored mSOD mRNA expression and quenched the oxidative burst. These data suggest that PAN-induced aberrant sialylation occurs as a result of modulation of enzymes involved sialic acid metabolism some of which are affected by oxidative stress. These data suggest that sialic acid therapy not only reinstates functionally important negative charge but also acts a source of antioxidant activity.

Abstract: Summary
Shigella enters epithlial cells via internalization into a vacuole. Subsequent vacuolar membrane rupture allows bacterial escape into the cytosol for replication and cell-to-cell spread. Bacterial effectors such as IpgD, a PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase that generates PI(5)P and alters host actin, facilitate this internalization. Here, we identify host proteins involved in Shigella uptake and vacuolar membrane rupture by high-content siRNA screening and subsequently focus on Rab11, a constituent of the recycling compartment. Rab11-positive vesicles are recruited to the invasion site before vacuolar rupture, and Rab11 knockdown dramatically decreases vacuolar membrane rupture. Additionally, Rab11 recruitment is absent and vacuolar rupture is delayed in the ipgD mutant that does not dephosphorylate PI(4,5)P2 into PI(5)P. Ultrastructural analyses of Rab11-positive vesicles further reveal that ipgD mutant-containing vacuoles become confined in actin structures that likely contribute to delayed vacular rupture. These findings provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of vacuole progression and rupture during Shigella invasion.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. We have previously observed amyloid production in the retina of the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, we used tunicamycin-induced ER stress in RGC-5 cells, a cell line identical to the photoreceptor cell line 661W, to investigate the effect of ER stress on production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. We found that the mRNA level of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) remained stable, while the protein level of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) was decreased, the amyloid-beta precursor protein cleaving enzymes beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 and presenilin 1 were upregulated, Abeta1–40 and Abeta1–42 production were increased, and reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis markers were elevated following induction of ER stress. The protein level of Abeta degradation enzymes, neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme 1, and endothelin-converting enzyme 2 remained unchanged during the prolonged ER stress, showing that the generation of Abeta did not result from reduction of proteolysis by these enzymes. Inclusion of group II caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, increased the ER stress mediated Abeta production, suggesting that they are generated by a caspase-independent mechanism. Our findings provided evidence of a role of ER stress in Abeta peptide overproduction and apoptotic pathway activation in RGC-5 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Monoclonal antibodies derived from blood plasma cells of acute HIV-1-infected individuals are predominantly targeted to the HIV Env gp41 and cross-reactive with commensal bacteria. To understand this phenomenon, we examined anti-HIV responses in ileum B cells using recombinant antibody technology and probed their relationship to commensal bacteria. The dominant ileum B cell response was to Env gp41. Remarkably, a majority (82%) of the ileum anti-gp41 antibodies cross-reacted with commensal bacteria, and of those, 43% showed non-HIV-1 antigen polyreactivity. Pyrosequencing revealed shared HIV-1 antibody clonal lineages between ileum and blood. Mutated immunoglobulin G antibodies cross-reactive with both Env gp41 and microbiota could also be isolated from the ileum of HIV-1 uninfected individuals. Thus, the gp41 commensal bacterial antigen cross-reactive antibodies originate in the intestine, and the gp41 Env response in HIV-1 infection can be derived from a preinfection memory B cell pool triggered by commensal bacteria that cross-react with Env.

Abstract: Diabetes is caused by loss or dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells. Generation of beta cells in vitro is a promising strategy to develop a full-scale cell therapy against diabetes, and the development of methods without gene transfer may provide safer protocols for human therapy. Here we show that thyroid hormone receptors are expressed in embryonic murine pancreas. Addition of the thyroid hormone T3 in an ex vivo culture model of embryonic (E12.5) dorsal pancreas, mimicking embryonic pancreatic development, promoted an increase of ductal cell number at expenses of the acinar compartment. Double labeled cells expressing specific markers for ductal and acinar cells were observed, suggesting cell reprogramming. Increased mRNA levels of the pro-endocrine gene Ngn3 and an increased number of beta cells were detected in cultures treated previously with T3 suggesting that ductal cells promoted by T3 can subsequently differentiate into endocrine cells. So, indirectly, T3 induced endocrine differentiation. Moreover, T3 induced the expression of the pro-endocrine gene Ngn3 in the acinar 266-6 cell line. The pro-endocrine effect of T3 in the pancreatic explants and in the acinar cell line, was abrogated by the Akt inhibitor Ly294002 indicating the involvement of Akt signaling in this process. Altogether we show numerous evidences that define T3 as a promising candidate to generate endocrine cells from exocrine tissue, using ectopically gene expression free protocols, for cell therapy against diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia augments human embryonic stem cell (hESC) self-renewal via hypoxia-inducible factor 2α-activated OCT4 transcription. Hypoxia also increases the efficiency of reprogramming differentiated cells to a pluripotent-like state. Combined, these findings suggest that low O2 tension would impair the purposeful differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Here, we show that low O2 tension and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activity instead promote appropriate hESC differentiation. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, we implicate O2 tension as a modifier of a key cell fate decision, namely whether neural progenitors differentiate toward neurons or glia. Furthermore, our data show that even transient changes in O2 concentration can affect cell fate through HIF by regulating the activity of MYC, a regulator of LIN28/let-7 that is critical for fate decisions in the neural lineage. We also identify key small molecules that can take advantage of this pathway to quickly and efficiently promote the development of mature cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its global relevance, our understanding of how influenza A virus transmission impacts the overall population dynamics of this RNA virus remains incomplete. To define this dynamic, we inserted neutral barcodes into the influenza A virus genome to generate a population of viruses that can be individually tracked during transmission events. We find that physiological bottlenecks differ dramatically based on the infection route and level of adaptation required for efficient replication. Strong genetic pressures are responsible for bottlenecks during adaptation across different host species, whereas transmission between susceptible hosts results in bottlenecks that are not genetically driven and occur at the level of the recipient. Additionally, the infection route significantly influences the bottleneck stringency, with aerosol transmission imposing greater selection than direct contact. These transmission constraints have implications in understanding the global migration of virus populations and provide a clearer perspective on the emergence of pandemic strains.

Abstract: Due to their inherent tumor-tropic properties, genetically engineered stem cells may be advantageous for gene therapy treatment of various human cancers, including brain, liver, ovarian, and prostate malignancies. In this study, we employed human neural stem cells (HB1.F3; hNSCs) transduced with genes expressing Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (HB1.F3.CD) and human interferon-beta (HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β) as a treatment strategy for ductal breast cancer. CD can convert the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to its active chemotherapeutic form, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which induces a tumor-killing effect through DNA synthesis inhibition. IFN-β also strongly inhibits tumor growth by the apoptotic process. RT-PCR confirmed that HB1.F3.CD cells expressed CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells expressed both CD and IFN-β. A modified transwell migration assay showed that HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells selectively migrated toward MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. In hNSC-breast cancer co-cultures the viability of breast cancer cells which were significantly reduced by HB1.F3.CD or HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells in the presence of 5-FC. The tumor inhibitory effect was greater with the HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells, indicating an additional effect of IFN-β to 5-FU. In addition, the tumor-tropic properties of these hNSCs were found to be attributed to chemoattractant molecules secreted by breast cancer cells, including stem cell factor (SCF), c-kit, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor 2. An in vivo assay performed using MDA-MB-231/luc breast cancer mammary fat pad xenografts in immunodeficient mice resulted in 50% reduced tumor growth and increased long-term survival in HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β plus 5-FC treated mice relative to controls. Our results suggest that hNSCs genetically modified to express CD and/or IFN-β genes can be used as a novel targeted cancer gene therapy.

Mitf regulates osteoclastogenesis by modulating NFATc1 activity,

Abstract: Transcription factors Mitf and NFATc1 share many downstream targets that are critical for osteoclastogenesis. Since RANKL signals induce/activate both NFATc1 and Mitf isoform-E (Mitf-E), a tissue-restricted Mitf isoform in osteoclasts, it is plausible that the two factors work together to promote osteoclastogenesis. Although Mitf was shown to function upstream of NFATc1 previously, this study showed that expression of Mitf had little effects on NFATc1 and NFATc1 was critical for the induction of Mitf-E. In Mitfmi/mi mice, the semi-dominant mutation in Mitf gene leads to arrest of osteoclastogenesis in the early stages. However, when stimulated by RANKL, the Mitfmi/mi preosteoclasts responded with a significant induction of NFATc1, despite that the cells cannot differentiate into functional osteoclasts. In the absence of RANKL stimulation, very high levels of NFATc1 are required to drive osteoclast development. Our data indicate that Mitf functions downstream of NFATc1 in the RANKL pathway, and it plays an important role in amplifying NFATc1-dependent osteoclastogenic signals, which contributes to the significant synergy between the two factors during osteoclastogenesis. We propose that Mitf-E functions as a tissue-specific modulator for events downstream of NFATc1 activation during osteoclastogenesis.

Abstract: Clinical evidence indicates increased amyloid deposition in HIV-1-infected brains, which contributes to neurocognitive dysfunction in infected patients. Here we show that HIV-1 exposure stimulates amyloid beta (Aβ) nuclear entry in human brain endothelial cells (HBMEC), the main component of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Treatment with HIV-1 and/or Aβ resulted in concurrent increase in early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1), Smad, and phosphorylated Smad (pSmad) in nuclear fraction of HBMEC. A series of inhibition and silencing studies indicated that Smad and EEA1 closely interact by influencing their own nuclear entry; the effect that was attenuated by dynasore, a blocker of GTP-ase activity of dynamin. Importantly, inhibition of dynamin, EEA1, or TGF-β/Smad effectively attenuated HIV-1-induced Aβ accumulation in the nuclei of HBMEC. The present study indicates that nuclear uptake of Aβ involves the dynamin-dependent EEA1 and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways. These results identify potential novel targets to protect against HIV-1-associated dysregulation of amyloid processes at the BBB level.

Differential protein–protein interactions of full length human FasL and FasL fragments generated by proteolysis,

Abstract: Fas ligand (FasL) is a death factor of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. Like other members of this family of type II transmembrane proteins, FasL is subject to ectodomain shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) liberating soluble FasL and leaving membrane-integral N-terminal fragments (NTFs). These NTFs are further processed by intramembrane proteolysis through signal peptide peptidase-like 2a (SPPL2a), releasing intracellular domains (ICDs) which might translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription. Previous work established that the proline-rich domain within the cytosolic N-terminus of FasL is required for protein–protein interactions with different Src homology 3 (SH3) or WW domain proteins. Distinct binding partners regulate FasL storage and surface appearance or are involved in other aspects of FasL biology. Given the large number of FasL interactors, we asked whether proteolytically processed FasL fragments associate with the same or distinct sets of SH3 domain proteins. To address this, we performed co-precipitation experiments using a monoclonal antibody directed against the FasL N-terminus for subsequent protein detection of full length FasL and NTFs/ICDs in Western blots. We demonstrate that members of the sorting nexin (SNX) family bind full length FasL and its N-terminal fragments whereas members of the Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) protein family bind full length FasL, but fail to associate with processed FasL. Thus, we provide first evidence that full length FasL and FasL fragments display selectivity regarding their association with intracellular binding partners. The differential binding most likely governs the fate and function of the intracellular FasL fragments.

Abstract: Summary
Lung development-associated diseases are major causes of morbidity and lethality in preterm infants and children. Access to the lung progenitor/stem cell populations controlling pulmonary development during embryogenesis and early postnatal years is essential to understand the molecular basis of such diseases. Using a Nkx2-1mCherry reporter mouse, we have identified and captured Nkx2-1-expressing lung progenitor cells from the proximal lung epithelium during fetal development. These cells formed clonal spheres in semisolid culture that could be maintained in vitro and demonstrated self-renewal and expansion capabilities over multiple passages. In-vitro-derived Nkx2-1-expressing clonal spheres differentiated into a polarized epithelium comprised of multiple cell lineages, including basal and secretory cells, that could repopulate decellularized lung scaffolds. Nkx2-1 expression thus defines a fetal lung epithelial progenitor cell population that can be used as a model system to study pulmonary development and associated pediatric diseases.

Abstract: In the present study, the effects of 10- or 100-nm silica oxide (SiO2) NPs on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were examined. Cytotoxic effects and oxidative stress effects, including glutathione (GSH) depletion, the formation of protein radical species, and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, were measured. PBMC exposed to 10-nm NP concentrations from 50 to 4,000 ppm showed concentration-response increases in cell death; whereas, for 100-nm NPs, PBMC viability was not lost at <500 ppm. Interestingly, 10-nm NPs were more cytotoxic and induced more oxidative stress than 100-nm NPs. Immunoelectron micrographs show the cellular distribution of GSH and NPs. As expected based on the viability data, the 10-nm NPs disturbed cell morphology to a greater extent than did the 100-nm NPs. Antibody to the radical scavenger, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), was used for Western blot analysis of proteins with radicals; more DMPO proteins were found after exposure to 10-nm NPs than 100-nm NPs. Examination of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and IFN-γ) indicated that different ratios of cytokines were expressed and released after exposure to 10- and 100-nm NPs. IL-1β production was enhanced by 10- and 100-nm NPs;, the cytotoxicity of the NPs was associated with an increase in the IL-1β/IL-6 ratio and 100-nm NPs at concentrations that did not induce loss of cell viability enhanced IL-1β and IL-6 to an extent similar to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a T cell mitogen. In conclusion, our results indicate that SiO2 NPs trigger a cytokine inflammatory response and induce oxidative stress in vitro, and NPs of the same chemistry, but of different sizes, demonstrate differences in their intracellular distribution and immunomodulatory properties, especially with regard to IL-1β and IL-6 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Viral DNA sensing within the cytosol of infected cells activates type I interferon (IFN) expression. MITA/STING plays an essential role in this pathway by acting as both a sensor for the second messenger cGAMP and as an adaptor for downstream signaling components. In an expression screen for proteins that can activate the IFNB1 promoter, we identified the ER-associated protein ZDHHC1 as a positive regulator of virus-triggered, MITA/STING-dependent immune signaling. Zdhhc1−/− cells failed to effectively produce IFNs and other cytokines in response to infection with DNA but not RNA viruses. Zdhhc1−/− mice infected with the neurotropic DNA virus HSV-1 exhibited lower cytokine levels and higher virus titers in the brain, resulting in higher lethality. ZDHHC1 constitutively associated with MITA/STING and mediates dimerization/aggregation of MITA/STING and recruitment of the downstream signaling components TBK1 and IRF3. These findings support a role for ZDHHC1 in mediating MITA/STING-dependent innate immune response against DNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
The recent development of targeted murine reporter alleles as proxies for intestinal stem cell activity has led to significant advances in our understanding of somatic stem cell hierarchies and dynamics. Analysis of these reporters has led to a model in which an indispensable reserve stem cell at the top of the hierarchy (marked by Bmi1 and Hopx reporters) gives rise to active intestinal stem cells (marked by an Lgr5 reporter). Despite these advances, controversy exists regarding the specificity and fidelity with which these alleles distinguish intestinal stem cell populations. Here, we undertake a comprehensive comparison of widely used proxy reporters including both CreERT2 and EGFP cassettes targeted to the Lgr5, Bmi1, and Hopx loci. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of these populations and their progeny reveals that reserve and active intestinal stem cells are molecularly and functionally distinct, supporting a two-stem-cell model for intestinal self-renewal.

Abstract: Summary
The salamander is the only tetrapod that functionally regenerates all cell types of the limb and spinal cord (SC) and thus represents an important regeneration model, but the lack of gene-knockout technology has limited molecular analysis. We compared transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) in the knockout of three loci in the axolotl and find that CRISPRs show highly penetrant knockout with less toxic effects compared to TALENs. Deletion of Sox2 in up to 100% of cells yielded viable F0 larvae with normal SC organization and ependymoglial cell marker expression such as GFAP and ZO-1. However, upon tail amputation, neural stem cell proliferation was inhibited, resulting in spinal-cord-specific regeneration failure. In contrast, the mesodermal blastema formed normally. Sox3 expression during development, but not regeneration, most likely allowed embryonic survival and the regeneration-specific phenotype. This analysis represents the first tissue-specific regeneration phenotype from the genomic deletion of a gene in the axolotl.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are highly conserved immunomodulatory molecules upregulated when cells are exposed to stressful stimuli, such as inflammation. Their involvement in various autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune bullous diseases and celiac disease, has been increasingly recognized. To further study the role of Hsp in autoimmune bullous diseases, we have investigated for the first time the humoral autoimmune response to Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH; n = 26), bullous pemphigoid (BP; n = 23), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV; n = 16), the first representing a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. While in patients with active BP and PV, serum levels of autoantibodies against these Hsp did not differ from the corresponding age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 9–14); circulating autoantibodies against Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 were found to be increased at the active disease stage of DH. Further analysis of this latter patient subgroup showed that these anti-Hsp autoantibodies decreased in parallel with serum autoantibodies against epidermal and tissue transglutaminase during remission of skin lesions following a gluten-free diet, revealing significantly positive correlations. Although further studies on larger groups of patients will be needed to confirm the present data, our results support the notion that autoantibodies against Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 deserve attention in the study of the mechanisms that promote the development and maintenance of DH and possibly also the underlying celiac disease as well as potential novel disease biomarkers.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can self-renew and create committed progenitors, a process supposed to involve asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs). Previously, we had linked the kinetics of CD133 expression with ACDs but failed to detect asymmetric segregation of classical CD133 epitopes on fixed, mitotic HSPCs. Now, by using a novel anti-CD133 antibody (HC7), we confirmed the occurrence of asymmetric CD133 segregation on paraformaldehyde-fixed and living HSPCs. After showing that HC7 binding does not recognizably affect biological features of human HSPCs, we studied ACDs in different HSPC subtypes and determined the developmental potential of arising daughter cells at the single-cell level. Approximately 70% of the HSPCs of the multipotent progenitor (MPP) fraction studied performed ACDs, and about 25% generated lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP) as wells as erythromyeloid progenitor (EMP) daughter cells. Since MPPs hardly created daughter cells maintaining MPP characteristics, our data suggest that under conventional culture conditions, ACDs are lineage instructive rather than self-renewing.

Abstract: Renal cancer metastasis may result from oncogenic forces that contribute to the primary tumor. We have recently identified microRNA-21 as an oncogenic driver of renal cancer cells. The mechanism by which miR-21 controls renal cancer cell invasion is poorly understood. We show that miR-21 directly downregulates the proapoptotic protein PDCD4 to increase migration and invasion of ACHN and 786-O renal cancer cells as a result of phosphorylation/activation of Akt and IKKβ, which activate NFκB-dependent transcription. Constitutively active (CA) Akt or CA IKKβ blocks PDCD4-mediated inhibition and restores renal cancer cell migration and invasion. PDCD4 inhibits mTORC1 activity, which was reversed by CA IKKβ. Moreover, CA mTORC1 restores cell migration and invasion inhibited by PDCD4 and dominant negative IKKβ. Moreover, PDCD4 negatively regulates mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation upstream of this cascade. We show that PDCD4 forms a complex with rictor, an exclusive component of mTORC2, and that this complex formation is reduced in renal cancer cells due to increased miR-21 expression resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Thus our results identify a previously unrecognized signaling node where high miR-21 levels reduce rictor–PDCD4 interaction to increase phosphorylation of Akt and contribute to metastatic fitness of renal cancer cells.

Abstract: The transcription factor p63, member of the p53 gene family, encodes for two main isoforms, TAp63 and ΔNp63 with distinct functions on epithelial homeostasis and cancer. Recently, we discovered that TAp63 is essential for in vitro cardiogenesis and heart development in vivo. TAp63 is expressed by embryonic endoderm and acts on cardiac progenitors by a cell-non-autonomous manner. In the present study, we search for cardiogenic secreted factors that could be regulated by TAp63 and, by ChIP-seq analysis, identified Angiomodulin (AGM), also named IGFBP7 or IGFBP-rP1. We demonstrate that AGM is necessary for cardiac commitment of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and its regulation depends on TAp63 isoform. TAp63 directly activates both AGM and Activin-A during ESC cardiogenesis while these secreted factors modulate TAp63 gene expression by a feedback loop mechanism. The molecular circuitry controlled by TAp63 on AGM/Activin-A signaling pathway and thus on cardiogenesis emphasizes the importance of p63 during early cardiac development.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disorder of post-germinal center B cells, characterized by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells (PCs) within the bone marrow (BM). The reciprocal and complex interactions that take place between the different compartments of BM and the MM cells result in tumor growth, angiogenesis, bone disease, and drug resistance. Given the importance of the BM microenvironment in MM pathogenesis, we investigated the possible involvement of Hypoxia-Inducible transcription Factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in the PCs-bone marrow stromal cells interplay. To test this hypothesis, we used EZN-2968, a 3rd generation antisense oligonucleotide against HIF-1α, to inhibit HIF-1α functions. Herein, we provide evidence that the interaction between MM cells and BM stromal cells is drastically reduced upon HIF-1α down-modulation. Notably, we showed that upon exposure to HIF-1α inhibitor, neither the incubation with IL-6 nor the co-culture with BM stromal cells were able to revert the anti-proliferative effect induced by EZN-2968. Moreover, we observed a down-modulation of cytokine-induced signaling cascades and a reduction of MM cells adhesion capability to the extracellular matrix proteins in EZN-2968-treated samples. Taken together, these results strongly support the concept that HIF-1α plays a critical role in the interactions between bone BM cells and PCs in Multiple Myeloma.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic transformation by adenovirus small e1a depends on simultaneous interactions with the host lysine acetylases p300/CBP and the tumor suppressor RB. How these interactions influence cellular gene expression remains unclear. We find that e1a displaces RBs from E2F transcription factors and promotes p300 acetylation of RB1 K873/K874 to lock it into a repressing conformation that interacts with repressive chromatin-modifying enzymes. These repressing p300-e1a-RB1 complexes specifically interact with host genes that have unusually high p300 association within the gene body. The TGFβ-, TNF-, and interleukin-signaling pathway components are enriched among such p300-targeted genes. The p300-e1a-RB1 complex condenses chromatin in a manner dependent on HDAC activity, p300 lysine acetylase activity, the p300 bromodomain, and RB K873/K874 and e1a K239 acetylation to repress host genes that would otherwise inhibit productive virus infection. Thus, adenovirus employs e1a to repress host genes that interfere with viral replication.

Abstract: Summary
Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained in specialized niches within the bone marrow under steady-state conditions and mobilize for extramedullary hematopoiesis during periods of stress such as bacterial infections. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We show that systemic infection of mice with Escherichia coli, commonly associated with bacteremia in humans, mobilizes functional HSCs to the spleen. Accumulation of splenic HSCs (CD150+CD48-Lin−/lowSca1+cKit+) was diminished in TLR4-deficient and RIPK2-deficient mice, implicating TLRs and cytosolic NOD1/NOD2 signaling in the process. Accordingly, dual stimulation of NOD1 and TLR4 in radio-resistant cells alone was sufficient to mobilize HSCs, while TLR4 expression on HSCs was dispensable. Mechanistically, TLR4 and NOD1 synergistically induced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which was required for extramedullary HSC accumulation. Mobilized HSCs and progenitor cells gave rise to neutrophils and monocytes and contributed to limiting secondary infection.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular pathogens directly alter host cells in order to replicate and survive. While infection-induced changes in host transcription can be readily assessed, posttranscriptional alterations are more difficult to catalog. We applied the global protein stability (GPS) platform, which assesses protein stability based on relative changes in an adjoining fluorescent tag, to identify changes in the host proteome following infection with the obligate intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. Our results indicate that C. trachomatis profoundly remodels the host proteome independently of changes in transcription. Additionally, C. trachomatis replication depends on a subset of altered proteins, such as Pin1 and Men1, that regulate the host transcription factor AP-1 controlling host inflammation, stress, and cell survival. Furthermore, AP-1-dependent transcription is activated during infection and required for efficient Chlamydia growth. In summary, this experimental approach revealed that C. trachomatis broadly alters host proteins and can be applied to examine host-pathogen interactions and develop host-based therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
The high replication and mutation rates of RNA viruses can result in the emergence of new epidemic variants. Thus, the ability to follow host-specific evolutionary trajectories of viruses is essential to predict and prevent epidemics. By studying the spatial and temporal evolution of chikungunya virus during natural transmission between mosquitoes and mammals, we have identified viral evolutionary intermediates prior to emergence. Analysis of virus populations at anatomical barriers revealed that the mosquito midgut and salivary gland pose population bottlenecks. By focusing on virus subpopulations in the saliva of multiple mosquito strains, we recapitulated the emergence of a recent epidemic strain of chikungunya and identified E1 glycoprotein mutations with potential to emerge in the future. These mutations confer fitness advantages in mosquito and mammalian hosts by altering virion stability and fusogenic activity. Thus, virus evolutionary trajectories can be predicted and studied in the short term before new variants displace currently circulating strains.

Abstract: Summary
Cell therapies treating pathological muscle atrophy or damage requires an adequate quantity of muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) not currently attainable from adult donors. Here, we generate cultures of approximately 90% skeletal myogenic cells by treating human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 followed by FGF2 and N2 supplements. Gene expression analysis identified progressive expression of mesoderm, somite, dermomyotome, and myotome markers, following patterns of embryonic myogenesis. CHIR99021 enhanced transcript levels of the pan-mesoderm gene T and paraxial-mesoderm genes MSGN1 and TBX6; immunofluorescence confirmed that 91% ± 6% of cells expressed T immediately following treatment. By 7 weeks, 47% ± 3% of cells were MYH+ve myocytes/myotubes surrounded by a 43% ± 4% population of PAX7+ve MPCs, indicating 90% of cells had achieved myogenic identity without any cell sorting. Treatment of mouse ESCs with these factors resulted in similar enhancements of myogenesis. These studies establish a foundation for serum-free and chemically defined monolayer skeletal myogenesis of ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Using in vitro and in vivo experimental systems and in situ analysis, we show that growth hormone (GH) is secreted locally by normal human mammary epithelial cells upon progesterone stimulation. GH increases proliferation of a subset of cells that express growth hormone receptor (GHR) and have functional properties of stem and early progenitor cells. In 72% of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions, an expansion of the cell population that expresses GHR was observed, suggesting that GH signaling may contribute to breast cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes severe visual impairment due in part to age-dependent impairment of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). It has been suggested that autologous human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) may represent a useful cell source for the generation of graft RPE. We generated hiPSC-derived RPE (hiPSC-RPE) cell sheets optimized to meet clinical use requirements, including quality, quantity, consistency, and safety. These cell sheets are generated as a monolayer of cells without any artificial scaffolds, express typical RPE markers, form tight junctions that exhibit polarized secretion of growth factors, and show phagocytotic ability and gene-expression patterns similar to those of native RPE. Additionally, upon transplantation, autologous nonhuman primate iPSC-RPE cell sheets showed no immune rejection or tumor formation. These results suggest that autologous hiPSC-RPE cell sheets may serve as a useful form of graft for use in tissue replacement therapy for AMD.

Abstract: Chitinases are essential enzymes for crustaceans and participates in several biological processes, such as nutrient digestion, morphogenesis, pathogenesis, and pathogen defense. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of Chi (named EcChi) was cloned from the hemocytes of ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda by rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods. The full-length cDNA of EcChi was 1,319 bp, including contains a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of 42 bp, 3′-UTR of 101 bp with a poly (A) tail, an open-reading frame of 1,176 bp, encoding a 391-amino acid polypeptide with the predicted molecular weight of 43.71 kDa and estimated isoelectric point of 4.78. Sequence analysis revealed that the conserved chitinases family 18 active site was predicted in the amino acid sequence of EcChi. BLAST analysis revealed that amino acids of EcChi shared high identity (61–77 %) with that of other crustaceans. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that EcChi could be detected in all the tested tissues, and strongly expressed in hepatopancreas of E. carinicauda. After challenged with Vibrio anguillarum and WSSV, EcChi transcripts both in hemocytes and hepatopancreas increased significantly in the first 3 h, respectively. These results indicated that EcChi might be involved in the innate immune responses to V. anguillarum and WSSV in E. carinicauda.

Abstract: In the study, we investigated the effect of dicoumarol, an anti-coagulant agent with the inhibitory activity of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in renal cancer cell. Combined treatment with dicoumarol and TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis in various human renal carcinoma cells including Caki, ACHN, and A498, but not in normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) and mouse kidney cells (TMCK-1). When we elucidated the relevance of NQO1 in dicoumarol plus TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, both ES936 (a NQO1 inhibitor) and knockdown of NQO1 with siRNA had no effect on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that the stimulating effect of dicoumarol on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is independent of NQO1 activity. We found that dicoumarol transcriptionally down-regulated Bcl-2 expression via inhibition of NF-κB and CREB activity, whereas it down-regulated Mcl-1 and c-FLIP expression at the post-translational level. Overexpression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, or c-FLIP overcame the dicoumarol plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis, indicating that down-regualtion of these anti-apoptotic proteins may critically contribute to the sensitizing effect of dicoumarol on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Abstract: Heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) is one of the most important heat-shock proteins that helps organisms to modulate stress response via over-expression. The HSP70 gene from Pomacea canaliculata was cloned using the RACE approach; the gene is 2,767 bp in length and contains an open reading frame of 1,932 bp, which is encoded by a polypeptide of 643 amino acids. BLAST analysis showed that the predicted amino acid sequence of the P. canaliculata HSP70 gene shared a relatively high similarity with that of other known eukaryotic species that display conserved HSP characteristics. The phylogeny demonstrated a separate clustering of the apple snail HSP70 with other constitutive members from other mollusk species. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the differential expression of HSP70 in both sexes of P. canaliculata at different temperature conditions. These results showed that HSP70 transcript levels decreased slightly under cold shock and increased significantly under heat-shock conditions in both sexes compared to normal temperatures (26 °C). Under cold-shock treatment, the sex effect was not significant. With heat treatment, HSP70 expression could be induced at 36°C in both females and males, and it peaked at 42 and 39°C in females and males, respectively. In addition, a clear time-dependent HSP70 expression pattern of the apple snail exposed to the same high temperature (36 °C) was observed at different time points. The maximal induction of HSP70 expression appeared at 12 and 48 h in males and females after heat shock, respectively. The maximal induction in females was significantly higher compared to males under heat stimulus. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that males were more susceptible to heat than females and provided useful molecular information for the ecological adaptability of P. canaliculata against extreme environmental stress.

Abstract: Summary
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) modulate various biological processes, but their role in host antiviral responses is largely unknown. Here we identify a lncRNA as a key regulator of antiviral innate immunity. Following from the observation that a lncRNA that we call negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) was dramatically downregulated during infection with several viruses, we ectopically expressed NRAV in human cells or transgenic mice and found that it significantly promotes influenza A virus (IAV) replication and virulence. Conversely, silencing NRAV suppressed IAV replication and virus production, suggesting that reduction of NRAV is part of the host antiviral innate immune response to virus infection. NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3 and MxA, by affecting histone modification of these genes. Our results provide evidence for a lncRNA in modulating the antiviral interferon response.

PACAP and VIP increase the expression of myelin-related proteins in rat schwannoma cells: Involvement of PAC1/VPAC2 receptor-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathways,

Abstract: PACAP and its cognate peptide VIP participate in various biological functions, including myelin maturation and synthesis. However, defining whether these peptides affect peripheral expression of myelin proteins still remains unanswered. To address this issue, we assessed whether PACAP or VIP contribute to regulate the expression of three myelin proteins (MAG, MBP and MPZ, respectively) using the rat schwannoma cell line (RT4-P6D2T), a well-established model to study myelin gene expression. In addition, we endeavored to partly unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. Expression of myelin-specific proteins was assessed in cells grown either in normal serum (10% FBS) or serum starved and treated with or without 100nM PACAP or VIP. Furthermore, through pharmacological approach using the PACAP/VIP receptor antagonist (PACAP6-38) or specific pathway (MAPK or PI3K) inhibitors we defined the relative contribution of receptors and/or signaling pathways on the expression of myelin proteins. Our data show that serum starvation (24h) significantly increased both MAG, MBP and MPZ expression. Concurrently, we observed increased expression of endogenous PACAP and related receptors. Treatment with PACAP or VIP further exacerbated starvation-induced expression of myelin markers, suggesting that serum withdrawal might sensitize cells to peptide activity. Stimulation with either peptides increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 residue but had no effect on phosphorylated Erk-1/2. PACAP6-38 (10μM) impeded starvation- or peptide-induced expression of myelin markers. Similar effects were obtained after pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin, 10μM) but not the MAPKK inhibitor (PD98059, 50μM). Together, the present finding corroborate the hypothesis that PACAP and VIP might contribute to the myelinating process preferentially via the canonical PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, providing the basis for future studies on the role of these peptides in demyelinating diseases.

Abstract: 1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenyl piperazine iodide (DMPP) is a synthetic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist that could reduce airway inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated that DMPP could dramatically inhibit glioma size maintained on the chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). We first performed MTT and BrdU incorporation experiments on U87 glioma cells in vitro to understand the mechanism involved. We established that DMPP did not significantly affect U87 cell proliferation and survival. We speculated that DMPP directly caused the tumor to regress by affecting the vasculature in and around the implanted tumor on our chick CAM model. Hence, we conducted detailed analysis of DMPP's inhibitory effects on angiogenesis. Three vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in vivo models were used in the study which included (1) early chick blood islands formation, (2) chick yolk-sac membrane (YSW) and (3) CAM models. The results revealed that DMPP directly suppressed all developmental stages involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis – possibly by acting through Ang-1 and HIF-2α signaling. In sum, our results show that DMPP could induce glioma regression grown on CAM by inhibiting vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Polymorphic rhoptry-secreted kinases (ROPs) are essential virulence factors of Toxoplasma gondii. In particular, the pseudokinase ROP5 is the major determinant of acute virulence in mice, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We developed a tandem affinity protein tagging and purification approach in T. gondii and used it to show that ROP5 complexes with the active kinases ROP18 and ROP17. Biochemical analyses indicate that ROP18 and ROP17 have evolved to target adjacent and essential threonine residues in switch region I of immunity-related guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) (IRGs), a family of host defense molecules that function to control intracellular pathogens. The combined activities of ROP17 and ROP18 contribute to avoidance of IRG recruitment to the intracellular T. gondii-containing vacuole, thus protecting the parasite from clearance in interferon-activated macrophages. These studies reveal an intricate, multilayered parasite survival strategy involving pseudokinases that regulate multiple active kinase complexes to synergistically thwart innate immunity.

Abstract: An experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of different lipotropes in modulating immunity and biochemical plasticity under conditions of sublethal low-dose pesticide-induced stress in fish. Labeo rohita fish fingerlings were divided in two sets with one set of fish continuously exposed to low-dose endosulfan (1/10th of 96-h LC50) for 21 days, the other was unexposed, and both sets of fish were fed with practical diets supplemented with either 2 % lecithin, 0.5 % betaine, or 0.1 % choline and compared against unsupplemented diet. Low-dose endosulfan exposure had adverse effects (P < 0.05/P < 0.01) on hematological profile (erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit), serum protein (total protein, albumin, and globulin) and lipid profile (cholesterol and triglyceride), anti-oxidative status (ascorbic acid content of muscle, liver, brain, and kidney and activity of anti-oxidative enzymes: catalase and superoxide dismutase), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle and brain), immunological attributes (WBC count, albumin to globulin ratio, phagocytic activity, and serum cortisol), and metabolic plasticity as revealed from enzyme activities (muscle lactate dehydrogenase, liver and kidney glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase-G6PDH activity). Dietary lipotropes prevented these effects completely or partially and the effects were lipotrope dependent. Kinetics (maximum velocity value Vmax, catalytic efficiency and Michaelis constant Km) of G6PDH enzyme from crude extracts of liver and kidney indicated inhibition due to endosulfan but lipotropes could protect enzyme and showed a stabilizing effect. The supplements also helped maintain integrity of histoarchitecture of the hepatocytes in endosulfan-exposed fish to a great extent. Feeding lipotropes to fish reared in endosulfan-free water also improved hematological and serum protein and lipid profiles and were immunostimulatory. In conclusion, dietary lipotropes, especially betaine and lecithin at the levels used, improve erythropoiesis, serum protein and lipid profile, anti-oxidant status, immunocompetence, neurotransmission, and protect the livers of L. rohita fingerlings even when continuously exposed to low-dose endosulfan.

Abstract: We have shown that oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression in neonatal rat enterocytes is robust from birth to weaning, but OTR function during this period is unknown. We previously reported that oxytocin (OT) stimulation of Caco2BB cells (enterocytes in vitro) inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is known to protectively reduce translation during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Because the mTORC1 pathway is linked to cellular stress, we investigated markers of UPR in OT-stimulated Caco2BB cells. We report that OT modulates several factors involved in sensing and translation of ER stress. High OT (62.5 nM) reduced translation initiation factor 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Ser65), which is known to inhibit cap-dependent translation via its rate-limiting eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Importantly, high OT increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) phospho-Ser51, which inhibits eIF2a. High OT also increased protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase phosphorylation, a sensor of ER stress and a kinase of eIF2a. Both high and low OT activated inositol requiring enzyme1 (IRE1), which generates the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and induces the UPR. We also show that OT modulates XBP1 splicing and induces tribbles 3 (TRIB3; a negative regulator of Akt and protein involved in autophagy) and immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP; ER-chaperone). Taken together, these results indicate that OT modulates sensors of ER stress and autophagy. These findings support our hypothesis that transiently elevated OTR expression in neonatal gut may serve a protective function during a critical postnatal developmental period.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are functionally unique for their self-renewal ability and pluripotency, but the molecular mechanisms giving rise to these properties are not fully understood. hESCs can differentiate into embryoid bodies (EBs) containing ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. In the miR-200 family, miR-200c was especially enriched in undifferentiated hESCs and significantly downregulated in EBs. The knockdown of the miR-200c in hESCs downregulated Nanog expression, upregulated GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) expression, and induced hESC apoptosis. The knockdown of GATA4 rescued hESC apoptosis induced by downregulation of miR-200c. miR-200c directly targeted the 3′-untranslated region of GATA4. Interestingly, the downregulation of GATA4 significantly inhibited EB formation in hESCs. Overexpression of miR-200c inhibited EB formation and repressed the expression of ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm markers, which could partially be rescued by ectopic expression of GATA4. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and activin A/nodal can sustain hESC renewal in the absence of feeder layer. Inhibition of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/activin A/nodal signaling by SB431542 treatment downregulated the expression of miR-200c. Overexpression of miR-200c partially rescued the expression of Nanog/phospho-Smad2 that was downregulated by SB431542 treatment. Our observations have uncovered novel functions of miR-200c and GATA4 in regulating hESC renewal and differentiation.

Abstract: Haploidentical hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is associated with an increased risk of graft failure and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to support in vivo normal hematopoiesis and to display potent immunesuppressive effects. We cotransplanted the culture-expanded third-party donor-derived umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs) in 21 young people with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) undergoing haplo-HSCT without T-cell-depleted. We observed that all patients had sustained hematopoietic engraftment without any adverse UC-MSC infusion-related events. Furthermore, we did not observe any increase in severe aGVHD. These data suggest that UC-MSCs, possibly thanks to their potent immunosuppressive effect on allo-reactive host T lymphocytes escaping the preparative regimen, reduce the risk of graft failure and severe GVHD in haplo-HSCT.

Abstract: Summary
During antiviral defense, interferon (IFN) signaling triggers nuclear transport of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 (PY-STAT1), which occurs via a subset of karyopherin alpha (KPNA) nuclear transporters. Many viruses, including Ebola virus, actively antagonize STAT1 signaling to counteract the antiviral effects of IFN. Ebola virus VP24 protein (eVP24) binds KPNA to inhibit PY-STAT1 nuclear transport and render cells refractory to IFNs. We describe the structure of human KPNA5 C terminus in complex with eVP24. In the complex, eVP24 recognizes a unique nonclassical nuclear localization signal (NLS) binding site on KPNA5 that is necessary for efficient PY-STAT1 nuclear transport. eVP24 binds KPNA5 with very high affinity to effectively compete with and inhibit PY-STAT1 nuclear transport. In contrast, eVP24 binding does not affect the transport of classical NLS cargo. Thus, eVP24 counters cell-intrinsic innate immunity by selectively targeting PY-STAT1 nuclear import while leaving the transport of other cargo that may be required for viral replication unaffected.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is an important defense mechanism against mycobacteria, the causative agents of tuberculosis. The molecular mechanisms that link mycobacterial recognition to autophagy remain unclear. Our analysis in zebrafish and human macrophage models of mycobacterial infection reveals that the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator DRAM1 functions downstream of pathogen recognition by the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R)-MYD88-NF-κB innate immune sensing pathway to activate selective autophagy. Mycobacterial infection of human macrophages and zebrafish embryos induced DRAM1 expression in a MYD88 and NF-κB-dependent manner. DRAM1 knockdown increased mycobacterial infection, whereas overexpression lowered infection by hyperactivating autophagy. DRAM1-mediated selective autophagic defenses require the cytosolic DNA sensor STING and the selective autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1. Contrary to its known role in autophagy-mediated cell death and cancer, this DRAM1 function is p53 independent. We propose that DRAM1 mediates autophagic defense against a broader range of intracellular pathogens, since DRAM1 expression was also induced by the common bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle can regenerate repeatedly due to the presence of resident stem cells, called satellite cells. Because satellite cells are usually quiescent, they must be activated before participating in muscle regeneration in response to stimuli such as injury, overloading, and stretch. Although satellite cell activation is a crucial step in muscle regeneration, little is known of the molecular mechanisms controlling this process. Recent work showed that the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays crucial roles in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of muscle satellite cells. We investigated the role of growth factors in S1P-mediated satellite cell activation. We found that epidermal growth factor (EGF) in combination with insulin induced proliferation of quiescent undifferentiated mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, which are also known as reserve cells, in serum-free conditions. Sphingosine kinase activity increased when reserve cells were stimulated with EGF. Treatment of reserve cells with the D-erythro-N,N-dimethylsphingosine, Sphingosine Kinase Inhibitor, or siRNA duplexes specific for sphingosine kinase 1, suppressed EGF-induced C2C12 activation. We also present the evidence showing the S1P receptor S1P2 is involved in EGF-induced reserve cell activation. Moreover, we demonstrated a combination of insulin and EGF promoted activation of satellite cells on single myofibers in a manner dependent on SPHK and S1P2. Taken together, our observations show that EGF-induced satellite cell activation is mediated by S1P and its receptor.

Abstract: Hydrogels provide a unique tool for neural tissue engineering. These materials can be customized for certain functions, i.e. to provide cell/drug delivery or act as a physical scaffold. Unfortunately, hydrogel complexities can negatively impact their biocompatibility, resulting in unintended consequences. These adverse effects may be combated with a better understanding of hydrogel chemical, physical, and mechanical properties, and how these properties affect encapsulated neural cells. We defined the polymerization and degradation rates and compressive moduli of 25 hydrogels formulated from different concentrations of hyaluronic acid (HA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Changes in compressive modulus were driven primarily by the HA concentration. The in vitro biocompatibility of fetal-derived (fNPC) and adult-derived (aNPC) neural progenitor cells was dependent on hydrogel formulation. Acute survival of fNPC benefited from hydrogel encapsulation. NPC differentiation was divergent: fNPC differentiated into mostly glial cells, compared with neuronal differentiation of aNPC. Differentiation was influenced in part by the hydrogel mechanical properties. This study indicates that there can be a wide range of HA and PEG hydrogels compatible with NPC. Additionally, this is the first study comparing hydrogel encapsulation of NPC derived from different aged sources, with data suggesting that fNPC and aNPC respond dissimilarly within the same hydrogel formulation.

Abstract: Nanofiber-expanded human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cell therapy is under consideration for treating peripheral and cardiac ischemia. However, the therapeutic efficacy of nanofiber-expanded human umbilical cord blood-derived (NEHUCB) CD34+ cell therapy for wound healing and its mechanisms are yet to be established. Using an excision wound model in NOD/SCID mice, we show herein that NEHUCB-CD34+ cells home to the wound site and significantly accelerate the wound-healing process compared to vehicle-treated control. Histological analysis reveals that accelerated wound closure is associated with the re-epithelialization and increased angiogenesis. Additionally, NEHUCB-CD34+ cell-therapy decreases expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NOS2A in the wound bed, and concomitantly increases expression of IL-10 compared to vehicle-treated control. These findings were recapitulated in vitro using primary dermal fibroblasts and NEHUCB-CD34+ cells. Moreover, NEHUCB-CD34+ cells attenuate NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation in dermal fibroblasts through enhanced secretion of IL-10, which is known to bind to NF-κB and suppress transcriptional activity. Collectively, these data provide novel mechanistic evidence of NEHUCB-CD34+ cell-mediated accelerated wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
A large number of point mutations have been identified in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) genomes to date. Whether these mutations are associated with iPSC generation is an important and controversial issue. In this study, we approached this critical issue in different ways, including an assessment of iPSCs versus embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and an investigation of variant allele frequencies and the heterogeneity of point mutations within a single iPSC clone. Through these analyses, we obtained strong evidence that iPSC-generation-associated point mutations occur frequently in a transversion-predominant manner just after the onset of cell lineage conversion. The heterogeneity of the point mutation profiles within an iPSC clone was also revealed and reflects the history of the emergence of each mutation. Further, our results suggest a possible approach for establishing iPSCs with fewer point mutations.

Abstract: Several human worldwide diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, atherosclerosis and other metabolic pathologies are related to the excessive accumulation of lipids in cells. Lipids accumulate in spherical cellular inclusions called lipid droplets (LDs) whose sizes range from fraction to one hundred of micrometers in adipocytes. It has been suggested that LDs can grow in size due to a fusion process by which a larger LD is obtained with spherical shape and volume equal to the sum of the progenitors’ ones. In this study, the size distribution of two populations of LDs was analyzed in immature and mature (5-days differentiated) 3T3-L1 adipocytes (first and second populations, respectively) after Oil Red O staining. A Monte Carlo simulation of interaction between LDs has been developed in order to quantify the size distribution and the number of fusion events needed to obtain the distribution of the second population size starting from the first one. Four models are presented here based on different kinds of interaction: a surface weighted interaction (R2 Model), a volume weighted interaction (R3 Model), a random interaction (Random model) and an interaction related to the place where the LDs are born (Nearest Model). The last two models mimic quite well the behavior found in the experimental data. This work represents a first step in developing numerical simulations of the LDs growth process. Due to the complex phenomena involving LDs (absorption, growth through additional neutral lipid deposition in existing droplets, de novo formation and catabolism) the study focuses on the fusion process. The results suggest that, to obtain the observed size distribution, a number of fusion events comparable with the number of LDs themselves is needed. Moreover the MC approach results a powerful tool for investigating the LDs growth process.

Abstract: Summary
Adult muscle’s exceptional capacity for regeneration is mediated by muscle stem cells, termed satellite cells. As with many stem cells, Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been proposed to be critical in satellite cells during regeneration. Using new genetic reagents, we explicitly test in vivo whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary and sufficient within satellite cells and their derivatives for regeneration. We find that signaling is transiently active in transit-amplifying myoblasts, but is not required for regeneration or satellite cell self-renewal. Instead, downregulation of transiently activated β-catenin is important to limit the regenerative response, as continuous regeneration is deleterious. Wnt/β-catenin activation in adult satellite cells may simply be a vestige of their developmental lineage, in which β-catenin signaling is critical for fetal myogenesis. In the adult, surprisingly, we show that it is not activation but rather silencing of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that is important for muscle regeneration.

Altered epigenetic regulation of homeobox genes in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells,

Abstract: To gain insight into oral squamous cell carcinogenesis, we performed deep sequencing (RNAseq) of non-tumorigenic human OKF6-TERT1R and tumorigenic SCC-9 cells. Numerous homeobox genes are differentially expressed between OKF6-TERT1R and SCC-9 cells. Data from Oncomine, a cancer microarray database, also show that homeobox (HOX) genes are dysregulated in oral SCC patients. The activity of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC), which causes epigenetic modifications, and retinoic acid (RA) signaling can control HOX gene transcription. HOXB7, HOXC10, HOXC13, and HOXD8 transcripts are higher in SCC-9 than in OKF6-TERT1R cells; using ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) we detected PRC2 protein SUZ12 and the epigenetic H3K27me3 mark on histone H3 at these genes in OKF6-TERT1R, but not in SCC-9 cells. In contrast, IRX1, IRX4, SIX2 and TSHZ3 transcripts are lower in SCC-9 than in OKF6-TERT1R cells. We detected SUZ12 and the H3K27me3 mark at these genes in SCC-9, but not in OKF6-TERT1R cells. SUZ12 depletion increased HOXB7, HOXC10, HOXC13, and HOXD8 transcript levels and decreased the proliferation of OKF6-TERT1R cells. Transcriptional responses to RA are attenuated in SCC-9 versus OKF6-TERT1R cells. SUZ12 and H3K27me3 levels were not altered by RA at these HOX genes in SCC-9 and OKF6-TERT1R cells. We conclude that altered activity of PRC2 is associated with dysregulation of homeobox gene expression in human SCC cells, and that this dysregulation potentially plays a role in the neoplastic transformation of oral keratinocytes.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived macrophage-like cells for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In previous studies, we established the technology to generate macrophage-like myeloid lineage cells with proliferating capacity from human iPS cells, and we designated the cells iPS-ML. iPS-ML reduced the level of Aβ added into the culture medium, and the culture supernatant of iPS-ML alleviated the neurotoxicity of Aβ. We generated iPS-ML expressing the Fc-receptor-fused form of a single chain antibody specific to Aβ. In addition, we made iPS-ML expressing Neprilysin-2 (NEP2), which is a protease with Aβ-degrading activity. In vitro, expression of NEP2 but not anti-Aβ scFv enhanced the effect to reduce the level of soluble Aβ oligomer in the culture medium and to alleviate the neurotoxicity of Aβ. To analyze the effect of iPS-ML expressing NEP2 (iPS-ML/NEP2) in vivo, we intracerebrally administered the iPS-ML/NEP2 to 5XFAD mice, which is a mouse model of AD. We observed significant reduction in the level of Aβ in the brain interstitial fluid following administration of iPS-ML/NEP2. These results suggested that iPS-ML/NEP2 may be a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of AD.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that the recombination of cells liberated from developing tooth germs develop into teeth. However, it is difficult to use human developing tooth germ as a source of cells because of ethical issues. Previous studies have reported that thymosin beta 4 (Tmsb4x) is closely related to the initiation and development of the tooth germ. We herein attempted to establish odontogenic epithelial cells from non-odontogenic HaCaT cells by transfection with TMSB4X. TMSB4X-transfected cells formed nodules that were positive for Alizarin-red S (ALZ) and von Kossa staining (calcium phosphate deposits) when cultured in calcification-inducing medium. Three selected clones showing larger amounts of calcium deposits than the other clones, expressed PITX2, Cytokeratin 14, and Sonic Hedgehog. The upregulation of odontogenesis-related genes, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Amelogenin (AMELX), Ameloblastin (AMBN) and Enamelin (ENAM) was also detected. These proteins were immunohistochemically observed in nodules positive for the ALZ and von Kossa staining. RUNX2-positive selected TMSB4X-transfected cells implanted into the dorsal subcutaneous tissue of nude mice formed matrix deposits. Immunohistochemically, AMELX, AMBN and ENAM were observed in the matrix deposits. This study demonstrated the possibility of induction of dental epithelial cell differentiation marker gene expression in non-odontogenic HaCaT cells by TMSB4X.

Abstract: Summary
Certain low-abundance bacterial species, such as the periodontitis-associated oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, can subvert host immunity to remodel a normally symbiotic microbiota into a dysbiotic, disease-provoking state. However, such pathogens also exploit inflammation to thrive in dysbiotic conditions. How these bacteria evade immunity while maintaining inflammation is unclear. As previously reported, P. gingivalis remodels the oral microbiota into a dysbiotic state by exploiting complement. Now we show that in neutrophils P. gingivalis disarms a host-protective TLR2-MyD88 pathway via proteasomal degradation of MyD88, whereas it activates an alternate TLR2-Mal-PI3K pathway. This alternate TLR2-Mal-PI3K pathway blocks phagocytosis, provides “bystander” protection to otherwise susceptible bacteria, and promotes dysbiotic inflammation in vivo. This mechanism to disengage bacterial clearance from inflammation required an intimate crosstalk between TLR2 and the complement receptor C5aR and can contribute to the persistence of microbial communities that drive dysbiotic diseases.

Abstract: Moderate levels of stress can be beneficial to health, while stress overload can cause injury or contribute to diseases. Despite a number of studies of adaptation or stress damage, the mechanisms of adaptation and stress damage remain far from clear. The effect and mechanisms of adaptation on cardiomyocytes damage caused by stress overload are discussed in this study. Data showed that mild repeated stress mitigated stress overload-induced cardiomyocyte injury both in an animal model of restraint stress and in H9C2 cells with GC (glucocorticoid) treatment. HSP70, HIP expression and interaction between HSP70 and HIP increased during adaptation induced by mild stress both in animals and H9C2 cells. Overexpression or inhibition of HSP70 in H9C2 cells with pCDNA-3.1-Hsp70 or KNK437 (HSP70 inhibitor) showed that HSP70 can protect H9C2 cells from GC-induced cell damage. A luciferase assay showed that Hsp70 plays its protective role through inhibition of GR transcription activity dependent on the interaction with HIP. These results indicated that HSP70 may promote adaptation with its interacting protein HIP, and increased levels of HSP70 and its interacting protein HIP during adaptation may play a protective role on stress-overload-induced cardiomyocyte injury.

Abstract: Dental tissues provide an alternative autologous source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for regenerative medicine. In this study, we isolated human dental MSCs of follicle, pulp and papilla tissue from a single donor tooth after impacted third molar extraction by excluding the individual differences. We then compared the morphology, proliferation rate, expression of MSC-specific and pluripotency markers, and in vitro differentiation ability into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes and functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). Finally, we analyzed the protein expression profiles of undifferentiated dental MSCs using 2DE coupled with MALDI-TOF-MS. Three types of dental MSCs largely shared similar morphology, proliferation potential, expression of surface markers and pluripotent transcription factors, and differentiation ability into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Upon hepatogenic induction, all MSCs were transdifferentiated into functional HLCs, and acquired hepatocyte functions by showing their ability for glycogen storage and urea production. Based on the proteome profiling results, we identified nineteen proteins either found commonly or differentially expressed among the three types of dental MSCs. In conclusion, three kinds of dental MSCs from a single donor tooth possessed largely similar cellular properties and multilineage potential. Further, these dental MSCs had similar proteomic profiles, suggesting their interchangeable applications for basic research and call therapy.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used in patients with locally advanced breast cancer to reduce tumor size before surgery. Unfortunately, resistance to chemotherapy may arise from a variety of mechanisms. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are highly expressed in mammary tumor cells, have been implicated in anticancer drug resistance. In spite of the widely described value of HSPs as molecular markers in cancer, their implications in breast tumors treated with anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been poorly explored. In this study, we have evaluated, by immunohistochemistry, the expression of HSP27 (HSPB1) and HSP70 (HSPA) in serial biopsies from locally advanced breast cancer patients (n = 60) treated with doxorubicin (DOX)- or epirubicin (EPI)-based monochemotherapy. Serial biopsies were taken at days 1, 3, 7, and 21, and compared with prechemotherapy and surgical biopsies. After surgery, the patients received additional chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil. High nuclear HSPB1 and HSPA expressions were found in invasive cells after DOX/EPI administration (P < 0.001), but the drug did not affect the cytoplasmic expression of the HSPs. Infiltrating lymphocytes showed high nuclear HSPA (P < 0.01) levels at postchemotherapy. No correlations were found between HSPs expression and the clinical and pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy. However, in postchemotherapy biopsies, high nuclear (>31 % of the cells) and cytoplasmic HSPA expressions (>11 % of the tumor cells) were associated with better DFS (P = 0.0348 and P = 0.0118, respectively). We conclude that HSPA expression may be a useful prognostic marker in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant DOX/EPI chemotherapy indicating the need to change the administered drugs after surgery for overcoming drug resistance.

Abstract: Tunneling nanotubes (TnTs) are long, non-adherent, actin-based cellular extensions that act as conduits for transport of cellular cargo between connected cells. The mechanisms of nanotube formation and the effects of the tumor microenvironment and cellular signals on TnT formation are unknown. In the present study, we explored exosomes as potential mediators of TnT formation in mesothelioma and the potential relationship of lipid rafts to TnT formation. Mesothelioma cells co-cultured with exogenous mesothelioma-derived exosomes formed more TnTs than cells cultured without exosomes within 24–48h; and this effect was most prominent in media conditions (low-serum, hyperglycemic medium) that support TnT formation (1.3–1.9-fold difference). Fluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed the purity of isolated exosomes and revealed that they localized predominantly at the base of and within TnTs, in addition to the extracellular environment. Time-lapse microscopic imaging demonstrated uptake of tumor exosomes by TnTs, which facilitated intercellular transfer of these exosomes between connected cells. Mesothelioma cells connected via TnTs were also significantly enriched for lipid rafts at nearly a 2-fold higher number compared with cells not connected by TnTs. Our findings provide supportive evidence of exosomes as potential chemotactic stimuli for TnT formation, and also lipid raft formation as a potential biomarker for TnT-forming cells.

Abstract: Cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) contributes to intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by virtue of its low-affinity/high-capacity Ca2+ binding properties, maintains sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) architecture and regulates excitation–contraction coupling, especially or exclusively upon β-adrenergic stimulation. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease associated with cardiac arrest in children or young adults. Recessive CPVT variants are due to mutations in the CASQ2 gene. Molecular and ultra-structural properties were studied in hearts of CASQ2R33Q/R33Q and of CASQ2−/− mice from post-natal day 2 to week 8. The drastic reduction of CASQ2-R33Q is an early developmental event and is accompanied by down-regulation of triadin and junctin, and morphological changes of jSR and of SR-transverse-tubule junctions. Although endoplasmic reticulum stress is activated, no signs of either apoptosis or autophagy are detected. The other model of recessive CPVT, the CASQ2−/− mouse, does not display the same adaptive pattern. Expression of CASQ2-R33Q influences molecular and ultra-structural heart development; post-natal, adaptive changes appear capable of ensuring until adulthood a new pathophysiological equilibrium.

Abstract: We hypothesized that the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on bone formation is increased via osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which is regulated by Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling. Our in vitro data showed that HBO increased cell proliferation, Wnt3a production, LRP6 phosphorylation, and cyclin D1 expression in osteogenically differentiated BMSCs. The mRNA and protein levels of Wnt3a, β-catenin, and Runx2 were upregulated while those of GSK-3β were downregulated after HBO treatment. The relative density ratio (phospho-protein/protein) of Akt and GSK-3β was both up-regulated while that of β-catenin was down-regulated after HBO treatment. We next investigated whether HBO affects the accumulation of β-catenin. Our Western blot analysis showed increased levels of translocated β-catenin that stimulated the expression of target genes after HBO treatment. HBO increased TCF-dependent transcription, Runx2 promoter/Luc gene activity, and the expression of osteogenic markers of BMSCs, such as alkaline phosphatase activity, type I collagen, osteocalcin, calcium, and the intensity of Alizarin Red staining. HBO dose dependently increased the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP2) and osterix production. We further demonstrated that HBO increased the expression of vacuolar-ATPases, which stimulated Wnt3a secretion from BMSCs. Finally, we showed that the beneficial effects of HBO on bone formation were related to Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling in a rabbit model by histology, mechanical testing, and immunohistochemical assays. Accordingly, we concluded that HBO increased the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by regulating Wnt3a secretion and signaling.

Abstract: Germ cells are the only cell type that passes genetic information to the next generation. In most metazoan species, primordial germ cells (PGCs) were induced from epiblasts by signals from the neighboring tissues. In vitro derivation of germ cells from the pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PSCs (iPSCs) are of great values for the treatment of infertility, for animal breeding, and for studying the mechanism of germ cell development. Although the derivations of male germ cells from PSCs have been previously reported, most of the studies failed to conduct the induction in a well-controlled and highly efficient manner. Here, we report the derivation of induced PGC-like cells (iPGCLCs) from mouse iPSCs via induced epiblast-like cells (iEpiLCs) as being monitored by the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein gene under the control of the promoter of stimulated by retinoic acid 8 (Stra8-EGFP). The identity of iPGCLCs was characterized by examining the expression of multiple marker genes as well as by the recovery of spermatogenesis after they were transplanted to the testis of infertile W/Wv mice. Furthermore, iPGCLCs were either induced to germline stem cell-like cells (iGSCLCs) or reverted back to embryonic germ cell-like cells (iEGCLCs). In conclusion, we have established an efficient procedure for inducing iPSCs into iPGCLCs that can be further expanded and induced to more developed germ cells. This work indicates that the technology of in vitro germ cell induction is becoming more sophisticated and can be further improved.

Abstract: Mammalian enabled (MENA), usually known as a direct regulator of microfilament polymerization and bundling, promotes metastasis in various cancers. Here we focus on the role of MENA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis and the relevant mechanism from the view of RhoA activity regulation. By HCC tissue microarray analysis, we found that MENA expression was positively associated with satellite lesions (P<0.01) and vascular invasion (P<0.01). Cases with membrane reinforcement of MENA staining in HCC tissues had significantly higher rates of early recurrence in the intermediate MENA expression group. Knockdown of MENA significantly suppressed HCC cell migration and invasion in vitro, as well as their intrahepatic and distant metastasis in vivo. Knockdown of MENA also decreased filopodia and stress fibers in SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, a decrease of RhoA activity was detected by a pull-down assay in SMMC-7721-shMENA cells. The ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, suppressed migration of both MENA knockdown SMMC-7721 cells and control cells, but diminished their difference. Thus, our findings suggest that MENA promotes HCC cell motility by activating RhoA.

Abstract: One of the applications of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) that are produced by ex vivo expansion is for use in in vivo bone tissue engineering. Cultured stromal cells are a mixture of cells at different stages of commitment and expansion capability, leading to a heterogeneous cell population that each time can differ in the potential to form in vivo bone. A parameter that predicts for in vivo bone forming capacity is thus far lacking. We employed single colony-derived BMSC cultures to identify such predictive parameters. Using limiting dilution, we have produced sixteen single CFU-F derived BMSC cultures from human bone marrow and found that only five of these formed bone in vivo. The single colony-derived BMSC strains were tested for proliferation, osteogenic-, adipogenic- and chondrogenic differentiation capacity and the expression of a variety of associated markers. The only robust predictors of in vivo bone forming capacity were the induction of alkaline phosphatase, (ALP) mRNA levels and ALP activity during in vitro osteogenic differentiation. The predictive value of in vitro ALP induction was confirmed by analyzing “bulk-cultured” BMSCs from various bone marrow biopsies. Our findings show that in BMSCs, the additional increase in ALP levels over basal levels during in vitro osteogenic differentiation is predictive of in vivo performance.

Abstract: Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived “mesenchymal stem cells”) can establish the hematopoietic microenvironment within heterotopic ossicles generated by transplantation at non-skeletal sites. Here we show that non-mineralized cartilage pellets formed by hBMSCs ex vivo generate complete ossicles upon heterotopic transplantation in the absence of exogenous scaffolds. These ossicles display a remarkable degree of architectural fidelity, showing that an exogenous conductive scaffold is not an absolute requirement for bone formation by transplanted BMSCs. Marrow cavities within the ossicles include erythroid, myeloid and granulopoietic lineages, clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors and phenotypic HSCs, indicating that complete stem cell niches and hematopoiesis are established. hBMSCs (CD146+ adventitial reticular cells) are established in the heterotopic chimeric bone marrow through a unique process of endochondral bone marrow formation, distinct from physiological endochondral bone formation. In this process, chondrocytes remain viable and proliferate within the pellet, are released from cartilage, and convert into bone marrow stromal cells. Once explanted in secondary culture, these cells retain phenotype and properties of skeletal stem cells (“MSCs”), including the ability to form secondary cartilage pellets and secondary ossicles upon serial transplantation. Ex vivo, hBMSCs initially induced to form cartilage pellets can be reestablished in adherent culture and can modulate gene expression between cartilage and stromal cell phenotypes. These data show that so-called “cartilage differentiation” of BMSCs in vitro is a reversible phenomenon, which is actually reverted, in vivo, to the effect of generating stromal cells supporting the homing of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Dugesia japonica planarian flatworms are naturally exposed to various microbes but typically survive this challenge. We show that planarians eliminate bacteria pathogenic to Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, and/or Drosophila melanogaster and thus represent a model to identify innate resistance mechanisms. Whole-transcriptome analysis coupled with RNAi screening of worms infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Legionella pneumophila identified 18 resistance genes with nine human orthologs, of which we examined the function of MORN2. Human MORN2 facilitates phagocytosis-mediated restriction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, L. pneumophila, and S. aureus in macrophages. MORN2 promotes the recruitment of LC3, an autophagy protein also involved in phagocytosis, to M. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes and subsequent maturation to degradative phagolysosomes. MORN2-driven trafficking of M. tuberculosis to single-membrane, LC3-positive compartments requires autophagy-related proteins Atg5 and Beclin-1, but not Ulk-1 and Atg13, highlighting the importance of MORN2 in LC3-associated phagocytosis. These findings underscore the value of studying planarian defenses to identify immune factors.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were used as a model system of human pancreas development to study characteristics of the polyhormonal cells that arise during fetal pancreas development. HESCs were differentiated into fetal-like pancreatic cells in vitro using a 33-day, 7-stage protocol. Cultures were ~90–95% PDX1-positive by day (d) 11 and 70–75% NKX6.1-positive by d17. Polyhormonal cells were scattered at d17, but developed into islet-like clusters that expressed key transcription factors by d33. Human C-peptide and glucagon secretion were first detected at d17 and increased thereafter in parallel with INS and GCG transcript levels. HESC-derived cells were responsive to KCl and arginine, but not glucose in perifusion studies. Compared to adult human islets, hESC-derived cells expressed ~10-fold higher levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA, but similar levels of glucokinase (GCK). In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of GLUT1 transcript within endocrine cells. However, GLUT1 protein was excluded from this population and was instead observed predominantly in non-endocrine cells, whereas GCK was co-expressed in insulin-positive cells. In rubidium efflux assays, hESC-derived cells displayed mild potassium channel activity, but no responsiveness to glucose, metabolic inhibitors or glibenclamide. Western blotting experiments revealed that the higher molecular weight SUR1 band was absent in hESC-derived cells, suggesting a lack of functional KATP channels at the cell surface. In addition, KATP channel subunit transcript levels were not at a 1:1 ratio, as would be expected (SUR1 levels were ~5-fold lower than KIR6.2). Various ratios of SUR1:KIR6.2 plasmids were transfected into COSM6 cells and rubidium efflux was found to be particularly sensitive to a reduction in SUR1. These data suggest that an impaired ratio of SUR1:KIR6.2 may contribute to the observed KATP channel defects in hESC-derived islet endocrine cells, and along with lack of GLUT1, may explain the absence of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic engineering of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via customized designer nucleases has been shown to be significantly more efficient than conventional gene targeting, but still typically depends on the introduction of additional genetic selection elements. In our study, we demonstrate the efficient nonviral and selection-independent gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Our high efficiencies of up to 1.6% of gene-targeted hiPSCs, accompanied by a low background of randomly inserted transgenes, eliminated the need for antibiotic or fluorescence-activated cell sorting selection, and allowed the use of short donor oligonucleotides for footprintless gene editing. Gene-targeted hiPSC clones were established simply by direct PCR screening. This optimized approach allows targeted transgene integration into safe harbor sites for more predictable and robust expression and enables the straightforward generation of disease-corrected, patient-derived iPSC lines for research purposes and, ultimately, for future clinical applications.

Abstract: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor and environmental sensor that regulates expression of genes involved in drug-metabolism and cell cycle regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, Ahr ablation in mice and studies with orthologous genes in invertebrates suggest that AHR may also play a significant role in embryonic development. To address this hypothesis, we studied the regulation of Ahr expression in mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny. In ES cells, interactions between OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX2 and Polycomb Group proteins at the Ahr promoter repress AHR expression, which can also be repressed by ectopic expression of reprogramming factors in hepatoma cells. In ES cells, unproductive RNA polymerase II binds at the Ahr transcription start site and drives the synthesis of short abortive transcripts. Activation of Ahr expression during differentiation follows from reversal of repressive marks in Ahr promoter chromatin, release of pluripotency factors and PcG proteins, binding of Sp factors, establishment of histone marks of open chromatin, and engagement of active RNAPII to drive full-length RNA transcript elongation. Our results suggest that reversible Ahr repression in ES cells holds the gene poised for expression and allows for a quick switch to activation during embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Heterogeneity is a hallmark of stem cell populations, in part due to the molecular differences between cells undergoing self-renewal and those poised to differentiate. We examined phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity in pluripotent stem cell populations, using public gene expression data sets. A high degree of concordance was observed between global gene expression variability and the reported heterogeneity of different human pluripotent lines. Network analysis demonstrated that low-variability genes were the most highly connected, suggesting that these are the most stable elements of the gene regulatory network and are under the highest regulatory constraints. Known drivers of pluripotency were among these, with lowest expression variability of POU5F1 in cells with the highest capacity for self-renewal. Variability of gene expression provides a reliable measure of phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity and predicts those genes with the highest degree of regulatory constraint within the pluripotency network.

Abstract: Tubular epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in the progression of renal tubular interstitial fibrosis (TIF), which subsequently leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and eventually, end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We propose that augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), a member of the newly discovered ALR/Erv1 protein family shown to ameliorate hepatic fibrosis, plays a similar protective role in renal tubular cells and has potential as a new treatment option for CKD. Here, we showed that recombinant human ALR (rhALR) inhibits EMT in renal tubular cells by antagonizing activation of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling pathway. Further investigation revealed that rhALR suppresses the expression of TGF-β receptor type II (TβR II) and significantly alleviates TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). No apparent adverse effects were observed upon the addition of rhALR alone to cells. These findings collectively suggest that ALR plays a role in inhibiting progression of renal tubular EMT, supporting its potential utility as an effective antifibrotic strategy to reverse TIF in CKD.

Abstract: Autophagy is the principle pathway within cells involved in clearing damaged proteins and organelles. Therefore autophagy is necessary to maintain the turnover balance of peptides and homoeostasis. Autophagy occurs at basal levels under normal conditions but can be upregulated by chemical inducers or stress conditions. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) serves as a versatile tool to understand the functions of genes implicated in autophagy. We report the identification of the zebrafish orthologues of mammalian genes MAP1LC3A (map1lc3a) and MAP1LC3B (map1lc3b) by phylogenetic and conserved synteny analysis and we examine their expression during embryonic development. The zebrafish map1lc3a and map1lc3b genes both show maternally contributed transcripts in early embryogenesis. However, levels of map1lc3a transcript steadily increase until at least 120h post-fertilisation while the levels of map1lc3b show a more variable pattern across developmental time. We have also validated the LC3I ratio/LC3I immunoblot autophagy assay in the presence of chloroquine (a lysosomal proteolysis inhibitor). We found that the LC3II/LC3I ratio is significantly increased in the presence of sodium azide with chloroquine supporting that hypoxia induces autophagy in zebrafish. This was supported by our qPCR assay that showed increased map1lc3a transcript levels in the presence of sodium azide. In contrast, levels of map1lc3b transcripts were reduced in the presence of rapamycin but the decrease in the presence of sodium azide did not reach statistical significance. Our study supports the use of zebrafish for analysing the interplay between hypoxia, development and autophagy.

Abstract: The fall in ambient oxygen pressure in high-altitude milieu elicits a wide range of physiological responses in the myocardium, which may differ from individual to individual. This condition, known as hypobaric hypoxia, invokes the cardioprotective heat shock response. The present study focuses on the role played by this ubiquitous response in mediating a differential tolerance to acute hypoxic stress. Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to simulated hypoxia equivalent to 223 mmHg pressure, screened on the basis of time taken for onset of a characteristic hyperventilatory response, and categorized as susceptible (<10 min), normal (10–25 min), or tolerant (>25 min). The tolerant animals displayed a significant upregulation of heat shock protein (Hsp)70/HSPA, evident through immunohistochemical staining of the cardiac tissue. The increased expression of transcription factor heat shock factor-1 led to the downstream activation of other chaperones, including Hsp90/HSPC, Hsp60/HSPD1, and Hsp27/HSPB1. The higher induction of HSPs in tolerant animals contributed to higher nitric oxide synthesis mediated by both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase activation. Conversely, susceptible animals showed significantly higher expression of the proinflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor alpha and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells in the myocardium. Evaluation of circulatory stress markers identified increased levels of reactive oxygen species, corticosterone and endothelin-1 in the susceptible animals highlighting their vulnerability to hypoxic stress. The heat shock response, through the action of chaperones and enhanced NO generation thus contributes substantially to the ability to sustain survival under acute sub lethal hypoxia.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are the most diverse but also the most poorly known family of molecular chaperones, and they play essential roles in various biological processes. The striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is one of the most serious pests of rice, causing extensive damage and yield loss. In this study, we isolated and characterized five members of the sHSPs family—Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.4, Cshsp21.5, Cshsp21.7a, and Cshsp21.7b—from C. suppressalis. The cDNAs of these genes encoded proteins of 177, 187, 191, 191, and 191 amino acids with isoelectric points of 7.0, 5.6, 6.1, 6.3, and 6.3, respectively. While Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b had no introns, Cshsp21.4 and Cshsp21.7a contained one and two introns, respectively. Structural analysis indicated that all five Cshsps possessed conserved arginine and a V/IXI/V motif, which is related to hydrophobic characteristics of sHSPs. The five heat shock proteins can be classified into two main groups: an orthologous type (Cshsp21.4 and Cshsp21.7a) and a species-specific type (Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b). Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed that Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, Cshsp21.7a, and Cshsp21.7b all exhibited their highest expression levels within Malpighian tubules or the hindgut, while such levels were found in the head for Cshsp21.4. The expression of Csshsps at different developmental stages revealed that the mRNA levels of Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.4, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b peaked in adults, whereas the highest level of Cshsp21.7a was observed in first instar larvae. Cshsp19.8 and Cshsp21.7b were both upregulated dramatically by heat and cold, and Cshsp21.5 could be induced by cold stress. Neither Cshsp21.4 nor Cshsp21.7a responded to heat or cold. These results demonstrated that different Csshsps play distinctive roles in the regulation of the physiological activities in C. suppressalis.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cells (hESC-CMs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) represent new models for drug discovery. Although hypertrophy is a high-priority target, we found that hiPSC-CMs were systematically unresponsive to hypertrophic signals such as the α-adrenoceptor (αAR) agonist phenylephrine (PE) compared to hESC-CMs. We investigated signaling at multiple levels to understand the underlying mechanism of this differential responsiveness. The expression of the normal α1AR gene, ADRA1A, was reversibly silenced during differentiation, accompanied by ADRA1B upregulation in either cell type. ADRA1B signaling was intact in hESC-CMs, but not in hiPSC-CMs. We observed an increased tonic activity of inhibitory kinase pathways in hiPSC-CMs, and inhibition of antihypertrophic kinases revealed hypertrophic increases. There is tonic suppression of cell growth in hiPSC-CMs, but not hESC-CMs, limiting their use in investigation of hypertrophic signaling. These data raise questions regarding the hiPSC-CM as a valid model for certain aspects of cardiac disease.

Abstract: Acute liver failure, the fatal deterioration of liver function, is the most common indication for emergency liver transplantation, and drug-induced liver injury and viral hepatitis are frequent in young adults. Stem cell therapy has come into the limelight as a potential therapeutic approach for various diseases, including liver failure and cirrhosis. In this study, we investigated therapeutic effects of tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) in concanavalin A (ConA)- and acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury. ConA-induced hepatitis resembles viral and immune-mediated hepatic injury, and acetaminophen overdose is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe. Intravenous administration of T-MSCs significantly reduced ConA-induced hepatic toxicity, but not acetaminophen-induced liver injury, affirming the immunoregulatory capacity of T-MSCs. T-MSCs were successfully recruited to damaged liver and suppressed inflammatory cytokine secretion. T-MSCs expressed high levels of galectin-1 and -3, and galectin-1 knockdown which partially diminished interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor α secretion from cultured T-cells. Galectin-1 knockdown in T-MSCs also reversed the protective effect of T-MSCs on ConA-induced hepatitis. These results suggest that galectin-1 plays an important role in immunoregulation of T-MSCs, which contributes to their protective effect in immune-mediated hepatitis. Further, suppression of T-cell activation by frozen and thawed T-MSCs implies great potential of T-MSC banking for clinical utilization in immune-mediated disease.

Abstract: Summary
miR-133a and miR-1 are known as muscle-specific microRNAs that are involved in cardiac development and pathophysiology. We have shown that both miR-1 and miR-133a are early and progressively upregulated during in vitro cardiac differentiation of adult cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), but only miR-133a expression was enhanced under in vitro oxidative stress. miR-1 was demonstrated to favor differentiation of CPCs, whereas miR-133a overexpression protected CPCs against cell death, targeting, among others, the proapoptotic genes Bim and Bmf. miR-133a-CPCs clearly improved cardiac function in a rat myocardial infarction model by reducing fibrosis and hypertrophy and increasing vascularization and cardiomyocyte proliferation. The beneficial effects of miR-133a-CPCs seem to correlate with the upregulated expression of several relevant paracrine factors and the plausible cooperative secretion of miR-133a via exosomal transport. Finally, an in vitro heart muscle model confirmed the antiapoptotic effects of miR-133a-CPCs, favoring the structuration and contractile functionality of the artificial tissue.

Mechanical unloading of bone in microgravity reduces mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration,

Abstract: Mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is a potent promoter of tissue growth and regeneration, whilst unloading in microgravity can cause reduced tissue regeneration, possibly through effects on stem cell tissue progenitors. To test the specific hypothesis that mechanical unloading alters differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell lineages, we studied cellular and molecular aspects of how bone marrow in the mouse proximal femur responds to unloading in microgravity. Trabecular and cortical endosteal bone surfaces in the femoral head underwent significant bone resorption in microgravity, enlarging the marrow cavity. Cells isolated from the femoral head marrow compartment showed significant down-regulation of gene expression markers for early mesenchymal and hematopoietic differentiation, including FUT1(−6.72), CSF2(−3.30), CD90(−3.33), PTPRC(−2.79), and GDF15(−2.45), but not stem cell markers, such as SOX2. At the cellular level, in situ histological analysis revealed decreased megakaryocyte numbers whilst erythrocytes were increased 2.33 fold. Furthermore, erythrocytes displayed elevated fucosylation and clustering adjacent to sinuses forming the marrow–blood barrier, possibly providing a mechanistic basis for explaining spaceflight anemia. Culture of isolated bone marrow cells immediately after microgravity exposure increased the marrow progenitor's potential for mesenchymal differentiation into in-vitro mineralized bone nodules, and hematopoietic differentiation into osteoclasts, suggesting an accumulation of undifferentiated progenitors during exposure to microgravity. These results support the idea that mechanical unloading of mammalian tissues in microgravity is a strong inhibitor of tissue growth and regeneration mechanisms, acting at the level of early mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation.

Abstract: Methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive psychostimulant drug of abuse that negatively interferes with neurogenesis. In fact, we have previously shown that METH triggers stem/progenitor cell death and decreases neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG). Still, little is known regarding its effect on DG stem cell properties. Herein, we investigate the impact of METH on mice DG stem/progenitor cell self-renewal functions. METH (10nM) decreased DG stem cell self-renewal, while 1nM delayed cell cycle in the G0/G1-to-S phase transition and increased the number of quiescent cells (G0 phase), which correlated with a decrease in cyclin E, pEGFR and pERK1/2 protein levels. Importantly, both drug concentrations (1 or 10nM) did not induce cell death. In accordance with the impairment of self-renewal capacity, METH (10nM) decreased Sox2+/Sox2+ while increased Sox2−/Sox2− pairs of daughter cells. This effect relied on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) signaling, which was prevented by the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (10μM). Moreover, METH (10nM) increased doublecortin (DCX) protein levels consistent with neuronal differentiation. In conclusion, METH alters DG stem cell properties by delaying cell cycle and decreasing self-renewal capacities, mechanisms that may contribute to DG neurogenesis impairment followed by cognitive deficits verified in METH consumers.

Knockdown of miR-210 decreases hypoxic glioma stem cells stemness and radioresistance,

Abstract: Glioma contains abundant hypoxic regions which provide niches to promote the maintenance and expansion of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are resistant to conventional therapies and responsible for recurrence. Given the fact that miR-210 plays a vital role in cellular adaption to hypoxia and in stem cell survival and stemness maintenance, strategies correcting the aberrantly expressed miR-210 might open up a new therapeutic avenue to hypoxia GSCs. In the present study, to explore the possibility of miR-210 as an effective therapeutic target to hypoxic GSCs, we employed a lentiviral-mediated anti-sense miR-210 gene transfer technique to knockdown miR-210 expression and analyze phenotypic changes in hypoxic U87s and SHG44s cells. We found that hypoxia led to an increased HIF-2α mRNA expression and miR-210 expression in GSCs. Knockdown of miR-210 decreased neurosphere formation capacity, stem cell marker expression and cell viability, and induced differentiation and G0/G1 arrest in hypoxic GSCs by partially rescued Myc antagonist (MNT) protein expression. Knockdown of MNT could reverse the gene expression changes and the growth inhibition resulting from knockdown of miR-210 in hypoxic GSCs. Moreover, knockdown of miR-210 led to increased apoptotic rate and Caspase-3/7 activity and decreased invasive capacity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactate production and radioresistance in hypoxic GSCs. These findings suggest that miR-210 might be a potential therapeutic target to eliminate GSCs located in hypoxic niches.

Abstract: Summary
During Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other respiratory infections, optimal T cell activation requires pathogen transport from the lung to a local draining lymph node (LN). However, the infected inflammatory monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) that transport M. tuberculosis to the local lymph node are relatively inefficient at activating CD4 T cells, possibly due to bacterial inhibition of antigen presentation. We found that infected migratory DCs release M. tuberculosis antigens as soluble, unprocessed proteins for uptake and presentation by uninfected resident lymph node DCs. This transfer of bacterial proteins from migratory to local DCs results in optimal priming of antigen-specific CD4 T cells, which are essential in controlling tuberculosis. Additionally, this mechanism does not involve transfer of the whole bacterium and is distinct from apoptosis or exosome shedding. These findings reveal a mechanism that bypasses pathogen inhibition of antigen presentation by infected cells and generates CD4 T cell responses that control the infection.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer unique opportunities for developing novel cell-based therapies and disease modeling. In this study, we developed a directed differentiation method for hiPSCs toward corneal epithelial progenitor cells capable of terminal differentiation toward mature corneal epithelial-like cells. In order to improve the efficiency and reproducibility of our method, we replicated signaling cues active during ocular surface ectoderm development with the help of two small-molecule inhibitors in combination with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in serum-free and feeder-free conditions. First, small-molecule induction downregulated the expression of pluripotency markers while upregulating several transcription factors essential for normal eye development. Second, protein expression of the corneal epithelial progenitor marker p63 was greatly enhanced, with up to 95% of cells being p63 positive after 5 weeks of differentiation. Third, corneal epithelial-like cells were obtained upon further maturation.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian kidney is a complex organ consisting of multiple cell types. We previously showed that the Six2-expressing cap mesenchyme is a multipotent self-renewing progenitor population for the main body of the nephron, the basic functional unit of the kidney. However, the cellular mechanisms establishing stromal tissues are less clear. We demonstrate that the Foxd1-expressing cortical stroma represents a distinct multipotent self-renewing progenitor population that gives rise to stromal tissues of the interstitium, mesangium, and pericytes throughout kidney organogenesis. Fate map analysis of Foxd1-expressing cells demonstrates that a small subset of these cells contributes to Six2-expressing cells at the early stage of kidney outgrowth. Thereafter, there appears to be a strict nephron and stromal lineage boundary derived from Six2-expressing and Foxd1-expressing cell types, respectively. Taken together, our observations suggest that distinct multipotent self-renewing progenitor populations coordinate cellular differentiation of the nephron epithelium and renal stroma during mammalian kidney organogenesis.
