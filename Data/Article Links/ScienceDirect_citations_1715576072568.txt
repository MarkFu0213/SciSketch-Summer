Abstract: Summary
PYHIN proteins AIM2 and IFI204 sense pathogen DNA, while other PYHINs have been shown to regulate host gene expression through as-yet unclear mechanisms. We characterize mouse PYHIN IFI207, which we find is not involved in DNA sensing but rather is required for cytokine promoter induction in macrophages. IFI207 co-localizes with both active RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and IRF7 in the nucleus and enhances IRF7-dependent gene promoter induction. Generation of Ifi207−/− mice shows no role for IFI207 in autoimmunity. Rather, IFI207 is required for the establishment of a Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection and for Klebsiella macrophage phagocytosis. These insights into IFI207 function illustrate that PYHINs can have distinct roles in innate immunity independent of DNA sensing and highlight the need to better characterize the whole mouse locus, one gene at a time.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell transplantation presents a potentially curative strategy for genetic disorders of skeletal muscle, but this approach is limited by the deleterious effects of cell expansion in vitro and consequent poor engraftment efficiency. In an effort to overcome this limitation, we sought to identify molecular signals that enhance the myogenic activity of cultured muscle progenitors. Here, we report the development and application of a cross-species small-molecule screening platform employing zebrafish and mice, which enables rapid, direct evaluation of the effects of chemical compounds on the engraftment of transplanted muscle precursor cells. Using this system, we screened a library of bioactive lipids to discriminate those that could increase myogenic engraftment in vivo in zebrafish and mice. This effort identified two lipids, lysophosphatidic acid and niflumic acid, both linked to the activation of intracellular calcium-ion flux, which showed conserved, dose-dependent, and synergistic effects in promoting muscle engraftment across these vertebrate species.

Abstract: Summary
Biology is tuned to the Earth’s diurnal cycle by the circadian clock, a transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop that regulates physiology via transcriptional activation and other post-transcriptional mechanisms. We hypothesize that circadian post-transcriptional regulation might stem from conformational shifts in the intrinsically disordered proteins that comprise the negative arm of the feedback loop to coordinate variation in negative-arm-centered macromolecular complexes. This work demonstrates temporal conformational fluidity in the negative arm that correlates with 24-h variation in physiologically diverse macromolecular complex components in eukaryotic clock proteins. Short linear motifs on the negative-arm proteins that correspond with the interactors localized to disordered regions and known temporal phosphorylation sites suggesting changes in these macromolecular complexes could be due to conformational changes imparted by the temporal phospho-state. Interactors that oscillate in the macromolecular complexes over circadian time correlate with post-transcriptionally regulated proteins, highlighting how time-of-day variation in the negative-arm protein complexes may tune cellular physiology.

Abstract: Summary
B cells generate functionally different classes of antibodies through class-switch recombination (CSR), which requires classical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) to join the DNA breaks at the donor and acceptor switch (S) regions. We show that the RNA-binding protein HNRNPU promotes C-NHEJ-mediated S-S joining through the 53BP1-shieldin DNA-repair complex. Notably, HNRNPU binds to the S region RNA/DNA G-quadruplexes, contributing to regulating R-loop and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulation. HNRNPU is an intrinsically disordered protein that interacts with both C-NHEJ and R-loop complexes in an RNA-dependent manner. Strikingly, recruitment of HNRNPU and the C-NHEJ factors is highly sensitive to liquid-liquid phase separation inhibitors, suggestive of DNA-repair condensate formation. We propose that HNRNPU facilitates CSR by forming and stabilizing the C-NHEJ ribonucleoprotein complex and preventing excessive R-loop accumulation, which otherwise would cause persistent DNA breaks and aberrant DNA repair, leading to genomic instability.

Abstract: Summary
Structurally complex genomic regions, such as centromeres, are inherently difficult to duplicate. The mechanism behind centromere inheritance is not well understood, and one of the key questions relates to the reassembly of centromeric chromatin following DNA replication. Here, we define ERCC6L2 as a key regulator of this process. ERCC6L2 accumulates at centromeres and promotes deposition of core centromeric factors. Interestingly, ERCC6L2−/− cells show unrestrained replication of centromeric DNA, likely caused by the erosion of centromeric chromatin. Beyond centromeres, ERCC6L2 facilitates replication at genomic repeats and non-canonical DNA structures. Notably, ERCC6L2 interacts with the DNA-clamp PCNA through an atypical peptide, presented here in a co-crystal structure. Finally, ERCC6L2 also restricts DNA end resection, acting independently of the 53BP1-REV7-Shieldin complex. We propose a mechanistic model, which reconciles seemingly distinct functions of ERCC6L2 in DNA repair and DNA replication. These findings provide a molecular context for studies linking ERCC6L2 to human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Diverse inbred mouse strains are important biomedical research models, yet genome characterization of many strains is fundamentally lacking in comparison with humans. In particular, catalogs of structural variants (SVs) (variants ≥ 50 bp) are incomplete, limiting the discovery of causative alleles for phenotypic variation. Here, we resolve genome-wide SVs in 20 genetically distinct inbred mice with long-read sequencing. We report 413,758 site-specific SVs affecting 13% (356 Mbp) of the mouse reference assembly, including 510 previously unannotated coding variants. We substantially improve the Mus musculus transposable element (TE) callset, and we find that TEs comprise 39% of SVs and account for 75% of altered bases. We further utilize this callset to investigate how TE heterogeneity affects mouse embryonic stem cells and find multiple TE classes that influence chromatin accessibility. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of SVs found in diverse mouse genomes and illustrates the role of TEs in epigenetic differences.

Abstract: Summary
Humans use predictions to improve speech perception, especially in noisy environments. Here we use 7-T functional MRI (fMRI) to decode brain representations of written phonological predictions and degraded speech signals in healthy humans and people with selective frontal neurodegeneration (non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia [nfvPPA]). Multivariate analyses of item-specific patterns of neural activation indicate dissimilar representations of verified and violated predictions in left inferior frontal gyrus, suggestive of processing by distinct neural populations. In contrast, precentral gyrus represents a combination of phonological information and weighted prediction error. In the presence of intact temporal cortex, frontal neurodegeneration results in inflexible predictions. This manifests neurally as a failure to suppress incorrect predictions in anterior superior temporal gyrus and reduced stability of phonological representations in precentral gyrus. We propose a tripartite speech perception network in which inferior frontal gyrus supports prediction reconciliation in echoic memory, and precentral gyrus invokes a motor model to instantiate and refine perceptual predictions for speech.

Abstract: Summary
Continuous plant growth is achieved by cell division and cell elongation. Brassinosteroids control cell elongation and differentiation throughout plant life. However, signaling cascades underlying BR-mediated cell elongation are unknown. In this study, we introduce cotton fiber, one of the most representative single-celled tissues, to decipher cell-specific BR signaling. We find that gain of function of GhBES1, a key transcriptional activator in BR signaling, enhances fiber elongation. The chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis identifies a cell-elongation-related protein, GhCERP, whose transcription is directly activated by GhBES1. GhCERP, a downstream target of GhBES1, transmits the GhBES1-mediated BR signaling to its target gene, GhEXPA3-1. Ultimately, GhEXPA3-1 promotes fiber cell elongation. In addition, inter-species functional analysis of the BR-mediated BES1-CERP-EXPA3 signaling cascade also promotes Arabidopsis root and hypocotyl growth. We propose that the BES1-CERP-EXPA3 module may be a broad-spectrum pathway that is universally exploited by diverse plant species to regulate BR-promoted cell elongation.

Abstract: The effect of tissue engineering strategies in combination with Lactobacillus plantarum and platelet-rich growth factor (PRGF) with the aim of creating an appropriate wound dressing can be useful in wound healing and infection prevention in patients suffering from acute and chronic skin damages. Therefore, in this study, a new approach was employed to create a bioactive multilayer electrospun scaffold composed of polyurethane (PU), PRGF, and gelatin fibers, then human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs), fibroblast cells (HU-02) and L. plantarum were cultured on the scaffold. The physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity of the scaffold were evaluated. In addition, the expression of the migration and proliferation genes of fibroblast cells were investigated by real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Mitochondrial activity assays revealed that PRFG and L. plantarum had a significant positive effect on the viability of target co-cultured cells.Fluorescent and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) images presented the cells and bacterial proliferation and adhesion in hydrophilic scaffolds within 21 days. The sustained release of PRGF from scaffolds with a zero-order pattern was confirmed. RT-PCR analysis revealed that PRGF elevated the expression of VEGF genes up to fourfold, but L. plantarum had a better effect on DDR2 gene expression compared to the TCPS group. Antibacterial tests showed that L. plantarum has a bacterial load reduction of more than 70% in CFU/mL. The present scaffold is an appropriate model for cell attachment, migration, proliferation, and infection prevention.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) family of chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in regulating DNA accessibility and gene expression. The three final-form subcomplexes—cBAF, PBAF, and ncBAF—are distinct in biochemical componentry, chromatin targeting, and roles in disease; however, the contributions of their constituent subunits to gene expression remain incompletely defined. Here, we performed Perturb-seq-based CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens targeting mSWI/SNF subunits individually and in select combinations, followed by single-cell RNA-seq and SHARE-seq. We uncovered complex-, module-, and subunit-specific contributions to distinct regulatory networks and defined paralog subunit relationships and shifted subcomplex functions upon perturbations. Synergistic, intra-complex genetic interactions between subunits reveal functional redundancy and modularity. Importantly, single-cell subunit perturbation signatures mapped across bulk primary human tumor expression profiles both mirror and predict cBAF loss-of-function status in cancer. Our findings highlight the utility of Perturb-seq to dissect disease-relevant gene regulatory impacts of heterogeneous, multi-component master regulatory complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Arboviruses are public health threats that cause explosive outbreaks. Major determinants of arbovirus transmission, geographic spread, and pathogenesis are the magnitude and duration of viremia in vertebrate hosts. Previously, we determined that multiple alphaviruses are cleared efficiently from murine circulation by the scavenger receptor MARCO (Macrophage receptor with collagenous structure). Here, we define biochemical features on chikungunya (CHIKV), o’nyong ’nyong (ONNV), and Ross River (RRV) viruses required for MARCO-dependent clearance in vivo. In vitro, MARCO expression promotes binding and internalization of CHIKV, ONNV, and RRV via the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain. Furthermore, we observe species-specific effects of the MARCO SRCR domain on CHIKV internalization, where those from known amplification hosts fail to promote CHIKV internalization. Consistent with this observation, CHIKV is inefficiently cleared from the circulation of rhesus macaques in contrast with mice. These findings suggest a role for MARCO in determining whether a vertebrate serves as an amplification or dead-end host following CHIKV infection.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) bind at different positions of the pre-mRNA molecules to promote or reduce the usage of a particular exon. Seeking to understand the working principle of these positional effects, we develop a capture RIC-seq (CRIC-seq) method to enrich specific RBP-associated in situ proximal RNA-RNA fragments for deep sequencing. We determine hnRNPA1-, SRSF1-, and PTBP1-associated proximal RNA-RNA contacts and regulatory mechanisms in HeLa cells. Unexpectedly, the 3D RNA map analysis shows that PTBP1-associated loops in individual introns preferentially promote cassette exon splicing by accelerating asymmetric intron removal, whereas the loops spanning across cassette exon primarily repress splicing. These “positional rules” can faithfully predict PTBP1-regulated splicing outcomes. We further demonstrate that cancer-related splicing quantitative trait loci can disrupt RNA loops by reducing PTBP1 binding on pre-mRNAs to cause aberrant splicing in tumors. Our study presents a powerful method for exploring the functions of RBP-associated RNA-RNA proximal contacts in gene regulation and disease.

Abstract: Background
The aim of our study was to investigate the roles and the underlying mechanisms of orthodenticle homolog 1 (OTX1) in ovarian cancer.
Methods
OTX1 expression was obtained from TCGA database. OTX1 expression in ovarian cancer cells was detected using qRT-PCR and western blot assay. The cell viability and proliferation was detected by CCK-8 and EdU assays. Cell invasion and migration were detected by transwell assay. Flow cytometry was utilized to determine cell apoptosis and cycle. In addition, western blot assay was used to detect the expression of cell cycle related protein (Cyclin D1 and p21), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related protein (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail), apoptosis related protein (Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3), and JAK/STAT pathway related protein (p-JAK2, JAK2, STAT3, and p-STAT3).
Results
OTX1 was highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and cells. OTX1 silencing blocked the cell cycle and repressed cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and migration, while OTX1 silencing facilitated the apoptosis of OVCAR3 and Caov3 cells. OTX1 silencing increased the protein levels of p21, E-cadherin, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3, while the protein levels of Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail were decreased by OTX1 silencing. Furthermore, OTX1 silencing suppressed the protein levels of p-JAK2/JAK2 and p-STAT3/STAT3 in OVCAR3 and Caov3 cells. Moreover, overexpression of OTX1 promoted cell proliferation and invasion and inhibited apoptosis in Caov3 cells, but AG490 (an inhibitor of JAK/STAT pathway) reversed the influences on cell biological behavior induced by overexpression of OTX1.
Conclusions
OTX1 silencing repressed ovarian cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and induced cell apoptosis, which might be involved in JAK/STAT signaling pathway. OTX1 may be considered as a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) has been reported to play a role in tumorigenesis. However, its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. In this study, we report that PPDPF is significantly downregulated in HCC and the decreased PPDPF expression indicates poor prognosis. In the dimethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model, hepatocyte-specific depletion of Ppdpf promotes hepatocarcinogenesis, and reintroduction of PPDPF into liver-specific Ppdpf knockout (LKO) mice inhibits the accelerated HCC development. Mechanistic study shows that PPDPF regulates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling through modulation of RIPK1 ubiquitination. PPDPF interacts with RIPK1 and facilitates K63-linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 via recruiting the E3 ligase TRIM21, which catalyzes K63-linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 at K140. In addition, liver-specific overexpression of PPDPF activates NF-κB signaling and attenuates apoptosis and compensatory proliferation in mice, which significantly suppresses HCC development. This work identifies PPDPF as a regulator of NF-κB signaling and provides a potential therapeutic candidate for HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are frequent every year and result in a range of disease severity. Here, we wanted to explore the potential contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to the variable human immune response. Transcriptome profiling in monocyte-derived macrophages from 39 individuals following IAV infection revealed significant inter-individual variation in viral load post-infection. Using transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), we identified a set of TE families with either enhanced or reduced accessibility upon infection. Of the enhanced families, 15 showed high variability between individuals and had distinct epigenetic profiles. Motif analysis showed an association with known immune regulators (e.g., BATFs, FOSs/JUNs, IRFs, STATs, NFkBs, NFYs, and RELs) in stably enriched families and with other factors in variable families, including KRAB-ZNFs. We showed that TEs and host factors regulating TEs were predictive of viral load post-infection. Our findings shed light on the role TEs and KRAB-ZNFs may play in inter-individual variation in immunity.

Abstract: It is known that cellular events underlying the processes of bone maintenance, remodeling, and repair have their basis in the embryonic production of bone. Shh signaling is widely described developing important morphogenetic control in bone by modifying the activity of osteoblast. Furthermore, identifying whether it is associated with the modulation of nuclear control is very important to be the basis for further applications. Experimentally, osteoblasts were exposed with cyclopamine (CICLOP) considering up to 1 day and 7 days, here considered an acute and chronic responses respectively. Firstly, we have validated the osteogenic model in vitro by exposing the osteoblasts to classical differentiating solution up to 7 days to allow the analysis of alkaline phosphatase and mineralization. Conversely, our data shows that differentiating osteoblasts present higher activity of inflammasome-related genes, while Shh signaling members were lower, suggesting a negative feedback between them. Thereafter, to better know about the role of Shh signaling on this manner, functional assays using CICLOP (5 μM) were performed and the data validates the previously hypothesis that Shh represses inflammasome related genes activities. Altogether, our data supports the anti-inflammatory effect of Shh signaling by suppressing Tnfα, Tgfβ and inflammasome related genes during osteoblast differentiation, and this comprehension might support the understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms related in bone regeneration by reporting molecular-related osteoblast differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
3D cell cultures, in particular organoids, are emerging models in the investigation of healthy or diseased tissues. Understanding the complex cellular sociology in organoids requires integration of imaging modalities across spatial and temporal scales. We present a multi-scale imaging approach that traverses millimeter-scale live-cell light microscopy to nanometer-scale volume electron microscopy by performing 3D cell cultures in a single carrier that is amenable to all imaging steps. This allows for following organoids’ growth, probing their morphology with fluorescent markers, identifying areas of interest, and analyzing their 3D ultrastructure. We demonstrate this workflow on mouse and human 3D cultures and use automated image segmentation to annotate and quantitatively analyze subcellular structures in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids. Our analyses identify local organization of diffraction-limited cell junctions in compact and polarized epithelia. The continuum-resolution imaging pipeline is thus suited to fostering basic and translational organoid research by simultaneously exploiting the advantages of light and electron microscopy.

Abstract: Summary
Much of the world’s population had already been infected with COVID-19 by the time the Omicron variant emerged at the end of 2021, but the scale of the Omicron wave was larger than any that had come before or has happened since, and it left a global imprinting of immunity that changed the COVID-19 landscape. In this study, we simulate a South African population and demonstrate how population-level vaccine effectiveness and efficiency changed over the course of the first 2 years of the pandemic. We then introduce three hypothetical variants and evaluate the impact of vaccines with different properties. We find that variant-chasing vaccines have a narrow window of dominating pre-existing vaccines but that a variant-chasing vaccine strategy may have global utility, depending on the rate of spread from setting to setting. Next-generation vaccines might be able to overcome uncertainty in pace and degree of viral evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal overnutrition increases inflammatory and metabolic disease risk in postnatal offspring. This constitutes a major public health concern due to increasing prevalence of these diseases, yet mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using nonhuman primate models, we show that maternal Western-style diet (mWSD) exposure is associated with persistent pro-inflammatory phenotypes at the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional levels in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from 3-year-old juvenile offspring and in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from fetal and juvenile bone marrow and fetal liver. mWSD exposure is also associated with increased oleic acid in fetal and juvenile bone marrow and fetal liver. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) profiling of HSPCs and BMDMs from mWSD-exposed juveniles supports a model in which HSPCs transmit pro-inflammatory memory to myeloid cells beginning in utero. These findings show that maternal diet alters long-term immune cell developmental programming in HSPCs with proposed consequences for chronic diseases featuring altered immune/inflammatory activation across the lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
We create a computational framework that utilizes loop extrusion (LE) by multiple condensin I/II motors to predict changes in chromosome organization during mitosis. The theory accurately reproduces the experimental contact probability profiles for the mitotic chromosomes in HeLa and DT40 cells. The LE rate is smaller at the start of mitosis and increases as the cells approach metaphase. Condensin II-mediated mean loop size is about six times larger than loops because of condensin I. The loops, which overlap each other, are stapled to a central dynamically changing helical scaffold formed by the motors during the LE process. A polymer physics-based data-driven method that uses the Hi-C contact map as the only input shows that the helix is characterized as random helix perversions (RHPs) in which the handedness changes randomly along the scaffold. The theoretical predictions, which are testable using imaging experiments, do not contain any parameters.

Abstract: Summary
The arginine dependency of cancer cells creates metabolic vulnerability. In this study, we examine the impact of arginine availability on DNA replication and genotoxicity resistance. Using DNA combing assays, we find that limiting extracellular arginine results in the arrest of cancer cells at S phase and a slowing or stalling of DNA replication. The translation of new histone H4 is arginine dependent and influences DNA replication. Increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) occupancy and helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF)-catalyzed PCNA K63-linked polyubiquitination protect arginine-starved cells from DNA damage. Arginine-deprived cancer cells display tolerance to genotoxicity in a PCNA K63-linked polyubiquitination-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the crucial role of extracellular arginine in nutrient-regulated DNA replication and provide potential avenues for the development of cancer treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are widely heralded as a drug-screening platform to develop new anti-cancer therapies. Here, we use a drug-repurposing library to screen PDOs of colorectal cancer (CRC) to identify hidden vulnerabilities within therapy-induced phenotypes. Using a microscopy-based screen that accurately scores drug-induced cell killing, we have tested 414 putative anti-cancer drugs for their ability to switch the EGFRi/MEKi-induced cytostatic phenotype toward cytotoxicity. A majority of validated hits (9/37) are microtubule-targeting agents that are commonly used in clinical oncology, such as taxanes and vinca-alkaloids. One of these drugs, vinorelbine, is consistently effective across a panel of >25 different CRC PDOs, independent of RAS mutational status. Unlike vinorelbine alone, its combination with EGFR/MEK inhibition induces apoptosis at all stages of the cell cycle and shows tolerability and effective anti-tumor activity in vivo, setting the basis for a clinical trial to treat patients with metastatic RAS-mutant CRC.

Abstract: Exocrine pancreas has been the field of many successful studies in pancreatic physiology and pathology. However, related disease - acute pancreatitis (AP) is still takes it toll with more than 100,000 related deaths worldwide per year. In spite of significant scientific progress and several human trials currently running for AP, there is still no specific treatment in the clinic. Studies of the mechanism of initiation of AP have identified two crucial conditions: sustained elevations of cytoplasmic calcium concentration (Ca2+ plateau) and significantly reduced intracellular energy (ATP depletion). These hallmarks are interdependent, i.e., Ca2+ plateau increase energy demand for its clearance while energy production is greatly affected by the pathology. Result of long standing Ca2+ plateau is destabilisation of the secretory granules and premature activation of the digestive enzymes leading to necrotic cell death. Main attempts so far to break the vicious circle of cell death have been concentrated on reduction of Ca2+ overload or reduction of ATP depletion. This review will summarise these approaches, including recent developments of potential therapies for AP.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic DNA is a crowded track where motor proteins frequently collide. It remains underexplored whether these collisions carry physiological function. In this work, we develop a single-molecule assay to visualize the trafficking of individual E. coli RNA polymerases (RNAPs) on DNA. Based on transcriptomic data, we hypothesize that RNAP collisions drive bidirectional transcription termination of convergent gene pairs. Single-molecule results show that the head-on collision between two converging RNAPs is necessary to prevent transcriptional readthrough but insufficient to release the RNAPs from the DNA. Remarkably, co-directional collision of a trailing RNAP into the head-on collided complex dramatically increases the termination efficiency. Furthermore, stem-loop structures formed in the nascent RNA are required for collisions to occur at well-defined positions between convergent genes. These findings suggest that physical collisions between RNAPs furnish a mechanism for transcription termination and that programmed genomic conflicts can be exploited to co-regulate the expression of multiple genes.

Abstract: Summary
Adherent cells migrate on layered tissue interfaces to drive morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. Although stiffer surfaces are known to enhance cell migration, it remains unclear whether cells sense basal stiff environments buried under softer, fibrous matrix. Using layered collagen-polyacrylamide gel systems, we unveil a migration phenotype driven by cell-matrix polarity. Here, cancer (but not normal) cells with stiff base matrix generate stable protrusions, faster migration, and greater collagen deformation because of “depth mechanosensing” through the top collagen layer. Cancer cell protrusions with front-rear polarity produce polarized collagen stiffening and deformations. Disruption of either extracellular or intracellular polarity via collagen crosslinking, laser ablation, or Arp2/3 inhibition independently abrogates depth-mechanosensitive migration of cancer cells. Our experimental findings, validated by lattice-based energy minimization modeling, present a cell migration mechanism whereby polarized cellular protrusions and contractility are reciprocated by mechanical extracellular polarity, culminating in a cell-type-dependent ability to mechanosense through matrix layers.

Abstract: Summary
Coronary heart disease damages the trabecular myocardium, and the regeneration of trabecular vessels may alleviate ischemic injury. However, the origins and developmental mechanisms of trabecular vessels remain unknown. Here, we show that murine ventricular endocardial cells generate trabecular vessels through an “angioEMT” mechanism. Time course fate mapping defined a specific wave of trabecular vascularization by ventricular endocardial cells. Single-cell transcriptomics and immunofluorescence identified a subpopulation of ventricular endocardial cells that underwent endocardial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) before these cells generated trabecular vessels. Ex vivo pharmacological activation and in vivo genetic inactivation experiments identified an EMT signal in ventricular endocardial cells involving SNAI2-TGFB2/TGFBR3, which was a prerequisite for later trabecular-vessel formation. Additional loss- and gain-of-function genetic studies showed that VEGFA-NOTCH1 signaling regulated post-EMT trabecular angiogenesis by ventricular endocardial cells. Our finding that trabecular vessels originate from ventricular endocardial cells through a two-step angioEMT mechanism could inform better regeneration medicine for coronary heart disease.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy and developing strategies to improve its efficacy are challenging goals. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrates that high CDK6 expression in melanoma is associated with poor progression-free survival of patients receiving single-agent immunotherapy. Depletion of CDK6 or cyclin D3 (but not of CDK4, cyclin D1, or D2) in cells of the tumor microenvironment inhibits tumor growth. CDK6 depletion reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment, and the host anti-tumor effect depends on cyclin D3/CDK6-expressing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. This occurs by CDK6 phosphorylating and increasing the activities of PTP1B and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), which, in turn, decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ, reducing the signal transduction for T cell activation. Administration of a PTP1B and TCPTP inhibitor prove more efficacious than using a CDK6 degrader in enhancing T cell-mediated immunotherapy. Targeting protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) might be an effective strategy for cancer patients who resist immunotherapy treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) participate in important bioactive regulatory processes and therefore can help elucidate the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we investigate the involvement of PTMs in ketogenic diet (KD)-improved fatty liver by multi-omics and reveal a core target of lysine malonylation, acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase 1 (ACC1). ACC1 protein levels and Lys1523 malonylation are significantly decreased by KD. A malonylation-mimic mutant of ACC1 increases its enzyme activity and stability to promote hepatic steatosis, whereas the malonylation-null mutant upregulates the ubiquitination degradation of ACC1. A customized Lys1523ACC1 malonylation antibody confirms the increased malonylation of ACC1 in the NAFLD samples. Overall, the lysine malonylation of ACC1 is attenuated by KD in NAFLD and plays an important role in promoting hepatic steatosis. Malonylation is critical for ACC1 activity and stability, highlighting the anti-malonylation effect of ACC1 as a potential strategy for treating NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
STING is a well-known signaling adaptor essential for sensing cytosolic dsDNA to produce type I interferon. Although the detailed underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic, recent studies show that STING activation can lead to T lymphocyte apoptosis. Here, we report that AIFM1 facilitates STING activation-induced cell apoptosis in T lymphocytes. Mechanistically, AIFM1 is upregulated after STING activation in T cells but not in HEK293T-STING and THP-1 cells, rendering T cells more sensitive to apoptosis. In contrast to the canonical role of AIFM1 in the caspase-independent parthanatos, the function of AIFM1 is operated by the formation of an AIFM1/IRF3/BAX complex and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which cause cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Furthermore, supplementation with newly synthesized AIFM1 can reconstitute STING activation-induced cell apoptosis in HEK293T-STING and THP-1 cells. Our study identifies AIFM1 as a key regulating factor determining the hypersensitivity of T lymphocytes to STING activation-induced cell apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Restricting caloric intake effectively reduces body weight, but most dieters fail long-term adherence to caloric deficit and eventually regain lost weight. Hypothalamic circuits that control hunger drive critically determine body weight; yet, how weight loss sculpts these circuits to motivate food consumption until lost weight is regained remains unclear. Here, we probe the contribution of synaptic plasticity in discrete excitatory afferents on hunger-promoting AgRP neurons. We reveal a crucial role for activity-dependent, remarkably long-lasting amplification of synaptic activity originating from paraventricular hypothalamus thyrotropin-releasing (PVHTRH) neurons in long-term body weight control. Silencing PVHTRH neurons inhibits the potentiation of excitatory input to AgRP neurons and diminishes concomitant regain of lost weight. Brief stimulation of the pathway is sufficient to enduringly potentiate this glutamatergic hunger synapse and triggers an NMDAR-dependent gaining of body weight that enduringly persists. Identification of this activity-dependent synaptic amplifier provides a previously unrecognized target to combat regain of lost weight.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple brain regions are engaged in classical fear conditioning. Despite evidence for cerebellar involvement in fear conditioning, the mechanisms by which cerebellar outputs modulate fear learning and memory remain unclear. We identify a population of deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neurons with monosynaptic glutamatergic projections to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN) (DCN→lPBN neurons) in mice. While optogenetic suppression of DCN→lPBN neurons impairs auditory fear memory, activation of DCN→lPBN neurons elicits freezing behavior only after auditory fear conditioning. Moreover, auditory fear conditioning potentiates DCN-lPBN synapses, and subsequently, auditory cue activates lPBN neurons after fear conditioning. Furthermore, DCN→lPBN neuron activation can replace the auditory cue but not footshock in fear conditioning. These findings demonstrate that cerebellar nuclei modulate auditory fear conditioning via transmitting conditioned stimuli signals to the lPBN. Collectively, our findings suggest that the DCN-lPBN circuit is a part of neuronal substrates within interconnected brain regions underscoring auditory fear memory.

Abstract: Summary
Biomolecular condensates are membraneless structures formed through phase separation. Recent studies have demonstrated that the material properties of biomolecular condensates are crucial for their biological functions and pathogenicity. However, the phase maintenance of biomolecular condensates in cells remains elusive. Here, we show that sodium ion (Na+) influx regulates the condensate liquidity under hyperosmotic stress. ASK3 condensates have higher fluidity at the high intracellular Na+ concentration derived from extracellular hyperosmotic solution. Moreover, we identified TRPM4 as a cation channel that allows Na+ influx under hyperosmotic stress. TRPM4 inhibition causes the liquid-to-solid phase transition of ASK3 condensates, leading to impairment of the ASK3 osmoresponse. In addition to ASK3 condensates, intracellular Na+ widely regulates the condensate liquidity and aggregate formation of biomolecules, including DCP1A, TAZ, and polyQ-protein, under hyperosmotic stress. Our findings demonstrate that changes in Na+ contribute to the cellular stress response via liquidity maintenance of biomolecular condensates.

Abstract: Summary
Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) develops through multistage epithelial cancer formation, i.e., from normal epithelium, low- and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive carcinoma. However, how the precancerous lesions progress to carcinoma remains elusive. Here, we report a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic study of 79 multistage esophageal lesions from 29 patients with ESCC. We reveal a gradual and significant loss of ANXA1 expression in epithelial cells due to its transcription factor KLF4 suppression along the lesion progression. We demonstrate that ANXA1 is a ligand to formyl peptide receptor type 2 (FPR2) on fibroblasts that maintain fibroblast homeostasis. Loss of ANXA1 leads to uncontrolled transformation of normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which can be enhanced by secreted TGF-β from malignant epithelial cells. Given the role of CAFs in cancer, our study underscores ANXA1/FPR2 signaling as an important crosstalk mechanism between epithelial cells and fibroblasts in promoting ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic background drives phenotypic variability in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Most studies to date have used transcript abundance as the primary molecular readout of cell state in PSCs. We performed a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis of 190 genetically diverse mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines. The quantitative proteome is highly variable across lines, and we identified pluripotency-associated pathways that were differentially activated in the proteomics data that were not evident in transcriptome data from the same lines. Integration of protein abundance to transcript levels and chromatin accessibility revealed broad co-variation across molecular layers as well as shared and unique drivers of quantitative variation in pluripotency-associated pathways. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping localized the drivers of these multi-omic signatures to genomic hotspots. This study reveals post-transcriptional mechanisms and genetic interactions that underlie quantitative variability in the pluripotent proteome and provides a regulatory map for mESCs that can provide a basis for future mechanistic studies.

Abstract: Summary
Autoreactive B cell responses are essential for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are known to construct lymphoid compartments and regulate immune functions. Here, we identify spleen FRC-derived acetylcholine (ACh) as a key factor that controls autoreactive B cell responses in SLE. In SLE, CD36-mediated lipid uptake leads to enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in B cells. Accordingly, the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation results in reduced autoreactive B cell responses and ameliorated diseases in lupus mice. Ablation of CD36 in B cells impairs lipid uptake and differentiation of autoreactive B cells during autoimmune induction. Mechanistically, spleen FRC-derived ACh promotes lipid influx and generation of autoreactive B cells through CD36. Together, our data uncover a novel function of spleen FRCs in lipid metabolism and B cell differentiation, placing spleen FRC-derived ACh in a key position in promoting autoreactive B cells in SLE.

Abstract: We previously reported that BMP9 inhibited breast cancer progression. However, the precise molecular mechanism is still unknown. Based on our RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) results, BMP9 significantly down-regulated the expression of long non-coding RNA SNHG3. Exogenous BMP9 promoted autophagy and inhibited migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells, which was effectively blunted by SNHG3 overexpression. Interestingly, SNHG3 was negatively connected with autophagy. Knockdown of SNHG3 induced autophagy by increasing the formation of autophagic vacuoles and thus inhibited the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Mechanically, BMP9-SNHG3 activated AMPK, AKT and mTOR signaling pathways to induce autophagy and inhibit migration and invasion. Meanwhile, BMP9 regulated SNHG3 transcription by suppressing c-Myc entry into the nucleus. In conclusion, BMP9 promotes autophagy and inhibits migration and invasion in breast cancer cells through the c-Myc/SNHG3/mTOR signaling axis, which might offer a fresh perspective on BMP9's breast cancer-inhibiting properties.

Abstract: Summary
Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) reside within cilia of mammalian cells and must undergo regulated exit from cilia for the appropriate transduction of signals such as hedgehog morphogens. Lysine 63-linked ubiquitin (UbK63) chains mark GPCRs for regulated removal from cilia, but the molecular basis of UbK63 recognition inside cilia remains elusive. Here, we show that the BBSome—the trafficking complex in charge of retrieving GPCRs from cilia—engages the ancestral endosomal sorting factor target of Myb1-like 2 (TOM1L2) to recognize UbK63 chains within cilia of human and mouse cells. TOM1L2 directly binds to UbK63 chains and the BBSome, and targeted disruption of the TOM1L2/BBSome interaction results in the accumulation of TOM1L2, ubiquitin, and the GPCRs SSTR3, Smoothened, and GPR161 inside cilia. Furthermore, the single-cell alga Chlamydomonas also requires its TOM1L2 ortholog in order to clear ubiquitinated proteins from cilia. We conclude that TOM1L2 broadly enables the retrieval of UbK63-tagged proteins by the ciliary trafficking machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Pediatric solid and central nervous system tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death among children. Identifying new targeted therapies necessitates the use of pediatric cancer models that faithfully recapitulate the patient’s disease. However, the generation and characterization of pediatric cancer models has significantly lagged behind adult cancers, underscoring the urgent need to develop pediatric-focused cell line resources. Herein, we establish a single-site collection of 261 cell lines, including 224 pediatric cell lines representing 18 distinct extracranial and brain childhood tumor types. We subjected 182 cell lines to multi-omics analyses (DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, DNA methylation), and in parallel performed pharmacological and genetic CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens to identify pediatric-specific treatment opportunities and biomarkers. Our work provides insight into specific pathway vulnerabilities in molecularly defined pediatric tumor classes and uncovers biomarker-linked therapeutic opportunities of clinical relevance. Cell line data and resources are provided in an open access portal.

Abstract: Summary
A limitation in the application of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) is the failure of these cells to achieve full functional maturity. The mechanisms by which directed differentiation differs from endogenous development, leading to consequent PSC-CM maturation arrest, remain unclear. Here, we generate a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reference of mouse in vivo CM maturation with extensive sampling of previously difficult-to-isolate perinatal time periods. We subsequently generate isogenic embryonic stem cells to create an in vitro scRNA-seq reference of PSC-CM-directed differentiation. Through trajectory reconstruction, we identify an endogenous perinatal maturation program that is poorly recapitulated in vitro. By comparison with published human datasets, we identify a network of nine transcription factors (TFs) whose targets are consistently dysregulated in PSC-CMs across species. Notably, these TFs are only partially activated in common ex vivo approaches to engineer PSC-CM maturation. Our study can be leveraged toward improving the clinical viability of PSC-CMs.

Abstract: The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been proven to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes. The m6A is catalyzed by methyltransferase complex, which mainly consist of methyltransferase (METTL) 3 and 14 heterodimer. The present study aimed to investigate the role of METTL 3 and 14 in biological properties of periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) via RNA-sequencing and specific cell assays. Firstly, the expressions of METTL3 and METTL14 were observed in PDLCs. Then, RNA-sequencing showed that cell properties were influenced after METTL3 or METTL14 was knocked down via short hairpin RNA (shRNA). In sh-METTL3 or METTL14 PDLCs, cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays showed a down-regulated proliferation, transwell system indicated suppressed migration. Lastly, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red staining (ARS) staining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot demonstrated the inhibited osteogenic potentials. It could be concluded that METTL3 and METTL14 play indispensable roles in the regenerative potential of PDLCs.

Abstract: Summary
During postnatal development, the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A deposits high levels of non-CG cytosine methylation in neurons. This methylation is critical for transcriptional regulation, and loss of this mark is implicated in DNMT3A-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we show in mice that genome topology and gene expression converge to shape histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) profiles, which in turn recruit DNMT3A and pattern neuronal non-CG methylation. We show that NSD1, an H3K36 methyltransferase mutated in NDD, is required for the patterning of megabase-scale H3K36me2 and non-CG methylation in neurons. We find that brain-specific deletion of NSD1 causes altered DNA methylation that overlaps with DNMT3A disorder models to drive convergent dysregulation of key neuronal genes that may underlie shared phenotypes in NSD1- and DNMT3A-associated NDDs. Our findings indicate that H3K36me2 deposited by NSD1 is important for neuronal non-CG DNA methylation and suggest that the H3K36me2-DNMT3A-non-CG-methylation pathway is likely disrupted in NSD1-associated NDDs.

Abstract: Summary
Organelle interactions play a significant role in compartmentalizing metabolism and signaling. Lipid droplets (LDs) interact with numerous organelles, including mitochondria, which is largely assumed to facilitate lipid transfer and catabolism. However, quantitative proteomics of hepatic peridroplet mitochondria (PDM) and cytosolic mitochondria (CM) reveals that CM are enriched in proteins comprising various oxidative metabolism pathways, whereas PDM are enriched in proteins involved in lipid anabolism. Isotope tracing and super-resolution imaging confirms that fatty acids (FAs) are selectively trafficked to and oxidized in CM during fasting. In contrast, PDM facilitate FA esterification and LD expansion in nutrient-replete medium. Additionally, mitochondrion-associated membranes (MAM) around PDM and CM differ in their proteomes and ability to support distinct lipid metabolic pathways. We conclude that CM and CM-MAM support lipid catabolic pathways, whereas PDM and PDM-MAM allow hepatocytes to efficiently store excess lipids in LDs to prevent lipotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
During intravasation, cancer cells cross the endothelial barrier and enter the circulation. Extracellular matrix stiffening has been correlated with tumor metastatic potential; however, little is known about the effects of matrix stiffness on intravasation. Here, we utilize in vitro systems, a mouse model, specimens from patients with breast cancer, and RNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) to investigate the molecular mechanism by which matrix stiffening promotes tumor cell intravasation. Our data show that heightened matrix stiffness increases MENA expression, which promotes contractility and intravasation through focal adhesion kinase activity. Further, matrix stiffening decreases epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1) expression, which triggers alternative splicing of MENA, decreases the expression of MENA11a, and enhances contractility and intravasation. Altogether, our data indicate that matrix stiffness regulates tumor cell intravasation through enhanced expression and ESRP1-mediated alternative splicing of MENA, providing a mechanism by which matrix stiffness regulates tumor cell intravasation.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic cholesterol overload promotes steatohepatitis. Insufficient understanding of liver stress defense impedes therapy development. Here, we elucidate the role of stress defense transcription factors, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor-1 (NRF1) and -2 (NRF2), in counteracting cholesterol-linked liver stress. Using a diet that increases liver cholesterol storage, expression profiles and phenotypes of liver from mice with hepatocyte deficiency of NRF1, NRF2, or both are compared with controls, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing is undertaken to identify target genes. Results show NRF1 and NRF2 co-regulate genes that eliminate cholesterol and mitigate inflammation and oxidative damage. Combined deficiency, but not deficiency of either alone, results in severe steatohepatitis, hepatic cholesterol overload and crystallization, altered bile acid metabolism, and decreased biliary cholesterol. Moreover, therapeutic effects of NRF2-activating drug bardoxolone require NRF1 and are supplemented by NRF1 overexpression. Thus, we discover complementary gene programming by NRF1 and NRF2 that counteract cholesterol-associated fatty liver disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Recent epigenome-wide studies suggest an association between blood DNA methylation and kidney function. However, the pathological importance remains unclear. Here, we show that the homing endonuclease I-PpoI-induced DNA double-strand breaks in kidney glomerular podocytes cause proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis with DNA methylation changes in blood cells as well as in podocytes. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals an increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with the activating/costimulatory receptor NKG2D in the kidneys, which exhibit a memory precursor effector cell phenotype, and the CD44high memory CD8+ T cells are also increased in the peripheral circulation. NKG2D blockade attenuates the renal phenotype caused by podocyte DNA damage. Blood methylome shows increased DNA methylation in binding sites for STAT1, a transcription factor contributing to CD8+ T cell homeostasis. Collectively, podocyte DNA damage alters the blood methylome, leading to changes in CD8+ T cells, which contribute to sustained renal injury in chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: Objective
To explore the effects and mechanisms of action of the PBX1/secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) axis in endometrial carcinoma (EC).
Methods
The expression of PBX1 and SFRP4 was analyzed using bioinformatics prediction, followed by validation in EC cells using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. After transduction with overexpression vectors for PBX1 and SFRP4, migration, proliferation, and invasion of EC cells were measured, accompanied by the detection of E-cadherin, Snail, N-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin, GSK-3β, and C-myc expression. The association between PBX1 and SFRP4 was validated using dual luciferase reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
Results
PBX1 and SFRP4 were downregulated in EC cells. Overexpression of PBX1 or SFRP4 resulted in weakened cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as decreased expression of Snail, N-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin, GSK-3β, and C-myc and increased expression of E-cadherin. PBX1 bound to the SFRP4 promoter and promoted its transcription. Knockdown of SFRP4 reversed the repression of overexpressed PBX1 in the malignant phenotypes and EMT of EC cells, and PBX1 repressed Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation by upregulating SFRP4 transcription.
Conclusion
PBX1 inhibited activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by promoting SFRP4 transcription, thereby suppressing malignant phenotypes in EC cells and the EMT process.

Abstract: Summary
Group 2B β-coronaviruses (sarbecoviruses) have caused regional and global epidemics in modern history. Here, we evaluate the mechanisms of cross-sarbecovirus protective immunity, currently less clear yet important for pan-sarbecovirus vaccine development, using a panel of alphavirus-vectored vaccines covering bat to human strains. While vaccination does not prevent virus replication, it protects against lethal heterologous disease outcomes in both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and clade 2 bat sarbecovirus challenge models. The spike vaccines tested primarily elicit a highly S1-specific homologous neutralizing antibody response with no detectable cross-virus neutralization. Rather, non-neutralizing antibody functions, mechanistically linked to FcgR4 and spike S2, mediate cross-protection in wild-type mice. Protection is lost in FcR knockout mice, further supporting a model for non-neutralizing, protective antibodies. These data highlight the importance of FcR-mediated cross-protective immune responses in universal pan-sarbecovirus vaccine designs.

Abstract: Summary
Poxvirus infections of the skin are a recent emerging public health concern, yet the mechanisms that mediate protective immunity against these viral infections remain largely unknown. Here, we show that T helper 1 (Th1) memory CD4+ T cells are necessary and sufficient to provide complete and broad protection against poxvirus skin infections, whereas memory CD8+ T cells are dispensable. Core 2 O-glycan-synthesizing Th1 effector memory CD4+ T cells rapidly infiltrate the poxvirus-infected skin microenvironment and produce interferon γ (IFNγ) in an antigen-dependent manner, causing global changes in gene expression to promote anti-viral immunity. Keratinocytes express IFN-stimulated genes, upregulate both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II antigen presentation in an IFNγ-dependent manner, and require IFNγ receptor (IFNγR) signaling and MHC class II expression for memory CD4+ T cells to protect the skin from poxvirus infection. Thus, Th1 effector memory CD4+ T cells exhibit potent anti-viral activity within the skin, and keratinocytes are the key targets of IFNγ necessary for preventing poxvirus infection of the epidermis.

Abstract: In induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), pluripotency is induced artificially by introducing the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. When a transgene is introduced using a viral vector, the transgene may be integrated into the host genome and cause a mutation and cancer. No integration occurs when an episomal vector is used, but this method has a limitation in that remnants of the virus or vector remain in the cell, which limits the use of such iPSCs in therapeutic applications. Chemical reprogramming, which relies on treatment with small-molecule compounds to induce pluripotency, can overcome this problem. In this method, reprogramming is induced according to the gene expression pattern of extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN) cells, which are used as an intermediate stage in pluripotency induction. Therefore, iPSCs can be induced only from established XEN cells. We induced XEN cells using small molecules that modulate a signaling pathway and affect epigenetic modifications, and devised a culture method which can produce homogeneous XEN cells. At least 4 passages were required to establish morphologically homogeneous chemically induced XEN (CiXEN) cells, whose properties were similar to those of XEN cells, as revealed through cellular and molecular characterization. Chemically iPSCs derived from CiXEN cells showed characteristics similar to those of mouse embryonic stem cells. Our results show that the homogeneity of CiXEN cells is critical for the efficient induction of pluripotency by chemicals.

Abstract: Summary
The expansion of introns within mammalian genomes poses a challenge for the production of full-length messenger RNAs (mRNAs), with increasing evidence that these long AT-rich sequences present obstacles to transcription. Here, we investigate RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation at high resolution in mammalian cells and demonstrate that RNAPII transcribes faster across introns. Moreover, we find that this acceleration requires the association of U1 snRNP (U1) with the elongation complex at 5′ splice sites. The role of U1 to stimulate elongation rate through introns reduces the frequency of both premature termination and transcriptional arrest, thereby dramatically increasing RNA production. We further show that changes in RNAPII elongation rate due to AT content and U1 binding explain previous reports of pausing or termination at splice junctions and the edge of CpG islands. We propose that U1-mediated acceleration of elongation has evolved to mitigate the risks that long AT-rich introns pose to transcript completion.

Abstract: Summary
Oscillator systems achieve synchronization when oscillators are coupled. The presomitic mesoderm is a system of cellular oscillators, where coordinated genetic activity is necessary for proper periodic generation of somites. While Notch signaling is required for the synchronization of these cells, it is unclear what information the cells exchange and how they react to this information to align their oscillatory pace with that of their neighbors. Combining mathematical modeling and experimental data, we found that interaction between murine presomitic mesoderm cells is controlled by a phase-gated and unidirectional coupling mechanism and results in deceleration of their oscillation pace upon Notch signaling. This mechanism predicts that isolated populations of well-mixed cells synchronize, revealing a stereotypical synchronization in the mouse PSM and contradicting expectations from previously applied theoretical approaches. Collectively, our theoretical and experimental findings reveal the underlying coupling mechanisms of the presomitic mesoderm cells and provide a framework to quantitatively characterize their synchronization.

Abstract: Secondary plant cell walls are composed of carbohydrate and lignin polymers, and collectively represent a significant renewable resource. Leveraging these resources depends in part on a mechanistic understanding for diffusive processes within plant cell walls. Common wood protection treatments and biomass conversion processes to create biorefinery feedstocks feature ion or solvent diffusion within the cell wall. X-ray fluorescence microscopy experiments have determined that ionic diffusion rates are dependent on cell wall hydration as well as the ionic species through non-linear relationships. In this work, we use classical molecular dynamics simulations to map the diffusion behavior of different plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin), ions (Na+, K+, Cu2+, Cl−) and water within a model for an intact plant cell wall at various hydration states (3–30 wt% water). From these simulations, we analyze the contacts between different plant cell wall components with each other and their interaction with the ions. Generally, diffusion increases with increasing hydration, with lignin and hemicellulose components increasing diffusion by an order of magnitude over the tested hydration range. Ion diffusion depends on charge. Positively charged cations preferentially interact with hemicellulose components, which include negatively charged carboxylates. As a result, positive ions diffuse more slowly than negatively charged ions. Measured diffusion coefficients are largely observed to best fit piecewise linear trends, with an inflection point between 10 and 15% hydration. These observations shed light onto the molecular mechanisms for diffusive processes within secondary plant cell walls at atomic resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosomes drastically limit transcription factor (TF) occupancy, while pioneer transcription factors (PFs) somehow circumvent this nucleosome barrier. In this study, we compare nucleosome binding of two conserved S. cerevisiae basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs, Cbf1 and Pho4. A cryo-EM structure of Cbf1 in complex with the nucleosome reveals that the Cbf1 HLH region can electrostatically interact with exposed histone residues within a partially unwrapped nucleosome. Single-molecule fluorescence studies show that the Cbf1 HLH region facilitates efficient nucleosome invasion by slowing its dissociation rate relative to DNA through interactions with histones, whereas the Pho4 HLH region does not. In vivo studies show that this enhanced binding provided by the Cbf1 HLH region enables nucleosome invasion and ensuing repositioning. These structural, single-molecule, and in vivo studies reveal the mechanistic basis of dissociation rate compensation by PFs and how this translates to facilitating chromatin opening inside cells.

Abstract: Summary
Sleep consists of two basic stages: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM sleep is characterized by slow high-amplitude cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, while REM sleep is characterized by desynchronized cortical rhythms. Despite this, recent electrophysiological studies have suggested the presence of slow waves (SWs) in local cortical areas during REM sleep. Electrophysiological techniques, however, have been unable to resolve the regional structure of these activities because of relatively sparse sampling. Here, we map functional gradients in cortical activity during REM sleep using mesoscale imaging in mice and show local SW patterns occurring mainly in somatomotor and auditory cortical regions with minimum presence within the default mode network. The role of the cholinergic system in local desynchronization during REM sleep is also explored by calcium imaging of cholinergic activity within the cortex and analyzing structural data. We demonstrate weaker cholinergic projections and terminal activity in regions exhibiting frequent SWs during REM sleep.

Abstract: Summary
Mosaic symptoms are commonly observed in virus-infected plants. However, the underlying mechanism by which viruses cause mosaic symptoms as well as the key regulator(s) involved in this process remain unclear. Here, we investigate maize dwarf mosaic disease caused by sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). We find that the manifestation of mosaic symptoms in SCMV-infected maize plants requires light illumination and is correlated with mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (mROS) accumulation. The transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses results together with the genetic and cytopathological evidence indicate that malate and malate circulation pathways play essential roles in promoting mosaic symptom development. Specifically, at the pre-symptomatic infection stage or infection front, SCMV infection elevates the enzymatic activity of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase by decreasing the phosphorylation of threonine527 under light, resulting in malate overproduction and subsequent mROS accumulation. Our findings indicate that activated malate circulation contributes to the manifestation of light-dependent mosaic symptoms via mROS.

Abstract: Summary
During the visual critical period (CP), sensory experience refines the structure and function of visual circuits. The basis of this plasticity was long thought to be limited to cortical circuits, but recently described thalamic plasticity challenges this dogma and demonstrates greater complexity underlying visual plasticity. Yet how visual experience modulates thalamic neurons or how the thalamus modulates CP timing is incompletely understood. Using a larval zebrafish, thalamus-centric ocular dominance model, we show functional changes in the thalamus and a role of inhibitory signaling to establish CP timing using a combination of functional imaging, optogenetics, and pharmacology. Hemisphere-specific changes in genetically defined thalamic neurons correlate with changes in visuomotor behavior, establishing a role of thalamic plasticity in modulating motor performance. Our work demonstrates that visual plasticity is broadly conserved and that visual experience leads to neuron-level functional changes in the thalamus that require inhibitory signaling to establish critical period timing.

Abstract: Summary
Complement-dependent microglia pruning of excitatory synapses has been widely reported in physiological and pathological conditions, with few reports concerning pruning of inhibitory synapses or direct regulation of synaptic transmission by complement components. Here, we report that loss of CD59, an important endogenous inhibitor of the complement system, leads to compromised spatial memory performance. Furthermore, CD59 deficiency impairs GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). This depends on regulation of GABA release triggered by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) rather than inhibitory synaptic pruning by microglia. Notably, CD59 colocalizes with inhibitory pre-synaptic terminals and regulates SNARE complex assembly. Together, these results demonstrate that the complement regulator CD59 plays an important role in normal hippocampal function.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), as the major DNA sensor, initiates DNA-stimulated innate immune responses and is essential for a healthy immune system. Although some regulators of cGAS have been reported, it still remains largely unclear how cGAS is precisely and dynamically regulated and how many potential regulators govern cGAS. Here we carry out proximity labeling of cGAS with TurboID in cells and identify a number of potential cGAS-interacting or -adjacent proteins. Deubiquitinase OTUD3, one candidate identified in cytosolic cGAS-DNA complex, is further validated to not only stabilize cGAS but also enhance cGAS enzymatic activity, which eventually promotes anti-DNA virus immune response. We show that OTUD3 can directly bind DNA and is recruited to the cytosolic DNA complex, increasing its association with cGAS. Our findings reveal OTUD3 as a versatile cGAS regulator and find one more layer of regulatory mechanism in DNA-stimulated innate immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that specify and stabilize cell subtypes remain poorly understood. Here, we identify two major subtypes of pancreatic β cells based on histone mark heterogeneity (βHI and βLO). βHI cells exhibit ∼4-fold higher levels of H3K27me3, distinct chromatin organization and compaction, and a specific transcriptional pattern. βHI and βLO cells also differ in size, morphology, cytosolic and nuclear ultrastructure, epigenomes, cell surface marker expression, and function, and can be FACS separated into CD24+ and CD24− fractions. Functionally, βHI cells have increased mitochondrial mass, activity, and insulin secretion in vivo and ex vivo. Partial loss of function indicates that H3K27me3 dosage regulates βHI/βLO ratio in vivo, suggesting that control of β cell subtype identity and ratio is at least partially uncoupled. Both subtypes are conserved in humans, with βHI cells enriched in humans with type 2 diabetes. Thus, epigenetic dosage is a novel regulator of cell subtype specification and identifies two functionally distinct β cell subtypes.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing (ERAAP) plays a crucial role in shaping the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I repertoire and maintaining immune surveillance. While murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) has multiple strategies for manipulating the antigen processing pathway to evade immune responses, the host has also developed ways to counter viral immune evasion. In this study, we find that MCMV modulates ERAAP and induces an interferon γ (IFN-γ)-producing CD8+ T cell effector response that targets uninfected ERAAP-deficient cells. We observe that ERAAP downregulation during infection leads to the presentation of the self-peptide FL9 on non-classical Qa-1b, thereby eliciting Qa-1b-restricted QFL T cells to proliferate in the liver and spleen of infected mice. QFL T cells upregulate effector markers upon MCMV infection and are sufficient to reduce viral load after transfer to immunodeficient mice. Our study highlights the consequences of ERAAP dysfunction during viral infection and provides potential targets for anti-viral therapies.

Abstract: Malfunctions in airway smooth muscle Ca2+-signalling leads to airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Ca2+-release from intracellular stores is important in mediating agonist-induced contractions, but the role of influx via l-type Ca2+ channels is controversial. We re-examined roles of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store, refilling of this store via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and l-type Ca2+ channel pathways on carbachol (CCh, 0.1–10 µM)-induced contractions of mouse bronchial rings and intracellular Ca2+ signals of mouse bronchial myocytes. In tension experiments, the ryanodine receptor (RyR) blocker dantrolene (100 µM) reduced CCh-responses at all concentrations, with greater effects on sustained rather than initial components of contraction. 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB, 100 μM), in the presence of dantrolene, abolished CCh-responses, suggesting the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store is essential for contraction. The SOCE blocker GSK-7975A (10 µM) reduced CCh-contractions, with greater effects at higher (e.g. 3 and 10 µM) CCh concentrations. Nifedipine (1 µM), abolished remaining contractions in GSK-7975A (10 µM). A similar pattern was observed on intracellular Ca2+-responses to 0.3 µM CCh, where GSK-7975A (10 µM) substantially reduced Ca2+ transients induced by CCh, and nifedipine (1 µM) abolished remaining responses. When nifedipine (1 µM) was applied alone it had less effect, reducing tension responses at all CCh concentrations by 25% - 50%, with greater effects at lower (e.g. 0.1 and 0.3 µM) CCh concentrations. When nifedipine (1 µM) was examined on the intracellular Ca2+-response to 0.3 µM CCh, it only modestly reduced Ca2+ signals, while GSK-7975A (10 µM) abolished remaining responses. In conclusion, Ca2+-influx from both SOCE and l-type Ca2+ channels contribute to excitatory cholinergic responses in mouse bronchi. The contribution of l-type Ca2+ channels was especially pronounced at lower doses of CCh, or when SOCE was blocked. This suggests l-type Ca2+ channels might be a potential target for bronchoconstriction under certain circumstances.

Abstract: Polycystic kidney disease is typified by cysts in the kidney and extra-renal manifestations including hypertension and heart failure. The main genetic underpinning this disease are loss-of function mutations to the two polycystin proteins, polycystin 1 and polycystin 2. Molecularly, the disease is characterized by changes in multiple signaling pathways including down regulation of calcium signaling, which, in part, is contributed by the calcium permeant properties of polycystin 2. These signaling pathways enable the cystic cells to survive and avoid cell death. This review focuses on the studies that have emerged in the past 5 years describing how the structural insights gained from PC-1 and PC-2 inform the calcium dependent molecular pathways of autophagy and the unfolded protein response that are regulated by the polycystin proteins and how it leads to cell survival and/or cell death.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) is an important tool to perturb transcription, but its effectiveness varies between target genes. We employ human pluripotent stem cells with thousands of randomly integrated barcoded reporters to assess epigenetic features that influence CRISPRa efficacy. Basal expression levels are influenced by genomic context and dramatically change during differentiation to neurons. Gene activation by dCas9-VPR is successful in most genomic contexts, including developmentally repressed regions, and activation level is anti-correlated with basal gene expression, whereas dCas9-p300 is ineffective in stem cells. Certain chromatin states, such as bivalent chromatin, are particularly sensitive to dCas9-VPR, whereas constitutive heterochromatin is less responsive. We validate these rules at endogenous genes and show that activation of certain genes elicits a change in the stem cell transcriptome, sometimes showing features of differentiated cells. Our data provide rules to predict CRISPRa outcome and highlight its utility to screen for factors driving stem cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
SLX4, disabled in the Fanconi anemia group P, is a scaffolding protein that coordinates the action of structure-specific endonucleases and other proteins involved in the replication-coupled repair of DNA interstrand cross-links. Here, we show that SLX4 dimerization and SUMO-SIM interactions drive the assembly of SLX4 membraneless compartments in the nucleus called condensates. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that SLX4 forms chromatin-bound clusters of nanocondensates. We report that SLX4 compartmentalizes the SUMO-RNF4 signaling pathway. SENP6 and RNF4 regulate the assembly and disassembly of SLX4 condensates, respectively. SLX4 condensation per se triggers the selective modification of proteins by SUMO and ubiquitin. Specifically, SLX4 condensation induces ubiquitylation and chromatin extraction of topoisomerase 1 DNA-protein cross-links. SLX4 condensation also induces the nucleolytic degradation of newly replicated DNA. We propose that the compartmentalization of proteins by SLX4 through site-specific interactions ensures the spatiotemporal control of protein modifications and nucleolytic reactions during DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholipid metabolism is crucial for membrane biogenesis and homeostasis of Plasmodium falciparum. To generate such phospholipids, the parasite extensively scavenges, recycles, and reassembles host lipids. P. falciparum possesses an unusually large number of lysophospholipases, whose roles and importance remain to be elucidated. Here, we functionally characterize one P. falciparum lysophospholipase, PfLPL3, to reveal its key role in parasite propagation during asexual blood stages. PfLPL3 displays a dynamic localization throughout asexual stages, mainly localizing in the host-parasite interface. Inducible knockdown of PfLPL3 disrupts parasite development from trophozoites to schizont, inducing a drastic reduction in merozoite progenies. Detailed lipidomic analyses show that PfLPL3 generates fatty acids from scavenged host lipids to generate neutral lipids. These are then timely mobilized to allow schizogony and merozoite formation. We then identify inhibitors of PfLPL3 from Medicine for Malaria Venture (MMV) with potent antimalarial activity, which could also serve as pertinent chemical tools to study parasite lipid synthesis.

Abstract: Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier causes microbial invasion that would lead to inflammation in the gut. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are essential components of the intestinal epithelial barrier, while the regulatory mechanisms of AMPs expression are not fully characterized. Here, we report that the ovarian tumor family deubiquitinase 4 (OTUD4) in Paneth cells restricts the expression of AMPs and thereby promotes experimental colitis and bacterial infection. OTUD4 is upregulated in the inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients and in the colon of mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS). Knockout of OTUD4 promotes the expression of AMPs in intestinal organoids after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or peptidoglycan (PGN) and in the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of mice after DSS treatment or Salmonella typhimurium (S.t.) infection. Consistently, Vil-Cre;Otud4fl/fl mice and Def-Cre;Otud4fl/fl mice exhibit hyper-resistance to DSS-induced colitis and S.t. infection compared to Otud4fl/fl mice. Mechanistically, knockout of OTUD4 results in hyper K63-linked ubiquitination of MyD88 and increases the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs to promote the expression of AMPs. These findings collectively highlight an indispensable role of OTUD4 in Paneth cells to modulate AMPs production and indicate OTUD4 as a potential target for gastrointestinal inflammation and bacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
Aging negatively affects hematopoiesis, with consequences for immunity and acquired blood cell disorders. Although impairments in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function contribute to this, the in vivo dynamics of such changes remain obscure. Here, we integrate extensive longitudinal functional assessments of HSC-specific lineage tracing with single-cell transcriptome and epitope profiling. In contrast to recent suggestions from single-cell RNA sequencing alone, our data favor a defined structure of HSC/progenitor differentiation that deviates substantially from HSC-derived hematopoiesis following transplantation. Native age-dependent attrition in HSC differentiation manifests as drastically reduced lymphoid output through an early lymphoid-primed progenitor (MPP Ly-I). While in vitro activation fails to rescue lymphoid differentiation from most aged HSCs, robust lymphopoiesis can be achieved by culturing elevated numbers of candidate HSCs. Therefore, our data position rare chronologically aged HSC clones, fully competent at producing lymphoid offspring, as a prime target for approaches aimed to improve lymphopoiesis in the elderly.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-clinical studies of fragile X syndrome (FXS) have focused on neurons, with the role of glia remaining largely underexplored. We examined the astrocytic regulation of aberrant firing of FXS neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Human FXS cortical neurons, co-cultured with human FXS astrocytes, fired frequent short-duration spontaneous bursts of action potentials compared with less frequent, longer-duration bursts of control neurons co-cultured with control astrocytes. Intriguingly, bursts fired by FXS neurons co-cultured with control astrocytes are indistinguishable from control neurons. Conversely, control neurons exhibit aberrant firing in the presence of FXS astrocytes. Thus, the astrocyte genotype determines the neuronal firing phenotype. Strikingly, astrocytic-conditioned medium, and not the physical presence of astrocytes, is capable of determining the firing phenotype. The mechanistic basis of this effect indicates that the astroglial-derived protein, S100β, restores normal firing by reversing the suppression of a persistent sodium current in FXS neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic plasticity of mitochondria ensures cell development, differentiation, and survival. The peptidase OMA1 regulates mitochondrial morphology via OPA1 and stress signaling via DELE1 and orchestrates tumorigenesis and cell survival in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. Here, we use unbiased systems-based approaches to show that OMA1-dependent cell survival depends on metabolic cues. A metabolism-focused CRISPR screen combined with an integrated analysis of human gene expression data found that OMA1 protects against DNA damage. Nucleotide deficiencies induced by chemotherapeutic agents promote p53-dependent apoptosis of cells lacking OMA1. The protective effect of OMA1 does not depend on OMA1 activation or OMA1-mediated OPA1 and DELE1 processing. OMA1-deficient cells show reduced glycolysis and accumulate oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins upon DNA damage. OXPHOS inhibition restores glycolysis and confers resistance against DNA damage. Thus, OMA1 dictates the balance between cell death and survival through the control of glucose metabolism, shedding light on its role in cancerogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of serum metabolites have the potential to uncover genes that influence human metabolism. Here, we combined an integrative genetic analysis that associates serum metabolites to membrane transporters with a coessentiality map of metabolic genes. This analysis revealed a connection between feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1) and phosphocholine, a downstream metabolite of choline metabolism. Loss of FLVCR1 in human cells strongly impairs choline metabolism due to the inhibition of choline import. Consistently, CRISPR-based genetic screens identified phospholipid synthesis and salvage machinery as synthetic lethal with FLVCR1 loss. Cells and mice lacking FLVCR1 exhibit structural defects in mitochondria and upregulate integrated stress response (ISR) through heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase. Finally, Flvcr1 knockout mice are embryonic lethal, which is partially rescued by choline supplementation. Altogether, our findings propose FLVCR1 as a major choline transporter in mammals and provide a platform to discover substrates for unknown metabolite transporters.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant gliomas are largely refractory to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. To explore the underlying immune regulators, we examine the microenvironment in glioma and find that tumor-infiltrating T cells are mainly confined to the perivascular cuffs and express high levels of CCR5, CXCR3, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Combined analysis of T cell clustering with T cell receptor (TCR) clone expansion shows that potential tumor-killing T cells are mainly categorized into pre-exhausted/exhausted and effector CD8+ T subsets, as well as cytotoxic CD4+ T subsets. Notably, a distinct subpopulation of CD4+ T cells exhibits innate-like features with preferential interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression. With IL-8-humanized mouse strain, we demonstrate that IL-8-producing CD4+ T, myeloid, and tumor cells orchestrate myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration and angiogenesis, which results in enhanced tumor growth but reduced ICB efficacy. Antibody-mediated IL-8 blockade or the inhibition of its receptor, CXCR1/2, unleashes anti-PD-1-mediated antitumor immunity. Our findings thus highlight IL-8 as a combinational immunotherapy target for glioma.

Abstract: Summary
The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as models for development and human disease has enabled the study of otherwise inaccessible tissues. A remaining challenge in developing reliable models is our limited understanding of the factors driving irregular differentiation of iPSCs, particularly the impact of acquired somatic mutations. We leveraged data from a pooled dopaminergic neuron differentiation experiment of 238 iPSC lines profiled with single-cell RNA and whole-exome sequencing to study how somatic mutations affect differentiation outcomes. We found that deleterious somatic mutations in key developmental genes, notably the BCOR gene, are strongly associated with failure in dopaminergic neuron differentiation and a larger proliferation rate in culture. We further identified broad differences in cell type composition between incorrectly and successfully differentiating lines, as well as significant changes in gene expression contributing to the inhibition of neurogenesis. Our work calls for caution in interpreting differentiation-related phenotypes in disease-modeling experiments.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin regulation and alternative splicing are both critical mechanisms guiding gene expression. Studies have demonstrated that histone modifications can influence alternative splicing decisions, but less is known about how alternative splicing may impact chromatin. Here, we demonstrate that several genes encoding histone-modifying enzymes are alternatively spliced downstream of T cell signaling pathways, including HDAC7, a gene previously implicated in controlling gene expression and differentiation in T cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and cDNA expression, we show that differential inclusion of HDAC7 exon 9 controls the interaction of HDAC7 with protein chaperones, resulting in changes to histone modifications and gene expression. Notably, the long isoform, which is induced by the RNA-binding protein CELF2, promotes expression of several critical T cell surface proteins including CD3, CD28, and CD69. Thus, we demonstrate that alternative splicing of HDAC7 has a global impact on histone modification and gene expression that contributes to T cell development.

Abstract: Leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) has been identified as a contributing factor for cartilage damage in osteoarthritis; however, its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the underlying mechanisms have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to explore the function of LRRC15 in RA-associated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) and in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and to dissect the epigenetic mechanisms involved. LRRC15 was overexpressed in the synovial tissues of patients with RA, and LRRC15 overexpression was associated with increased proliferative, migratory, invasive, and angiogenic capacities of RA-FLS and accelerated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. LRRC15 knockdown significantly inhibited synovial proliferation and reduced bone invasion and destruction in CIA mice. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) transcriptionally represses LRRC15 by binding to core-binding factor subunit beta (CBF-β). Overexpression of RUNX1 significantly inhibited the invasive phenotype of RA-FLS and suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Conversely, the effects of RUNX1 were significantly reversed after overexpression of LRRC15 or inhibition of RUNX1-CBF-β interactions. Therefore, we demonstrated that RUNX1-mediated transcriptional repression of LRRC15 inhibited the development of RA, which may have therapeutic effects for RA patients.

Abstract: Summary
We recently discovered that some bacteriophages establish a nucleus-like replication compartment (phage nucleus), but the core genes that define nucleus-based phage replication and their phylogenetic distribution were still to be determined. Here, we show that phages encoding the major phage nucleus protein chimallin share 72 conserved genes encoded within seven gene blocks. Of these, 21 core genes are unique to nucleus-forming phage, and all but one of these genes encode proteins of unknown function. We propose that these phages comprise a novel viral family we term Chimalliviridae. Fluorescence microscopy and cryoelectron tomography studies of Erwinia phage vB_EamM_RAY confirm that many of the key steps of nucleus-based replication are conserved among diverse chimalliviruses and reveal variations on this replication mechanism. This work expands our understanding of phage nucleus and PhuZ spindle diversity and function, providing a roadmap for identifying key mechanisms underlying nucleus-based phage replication.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons require large amounts of energy, but whether they can perform glycolysis or require glycolysis to maintain energy remains unclear. Using metabolomics, we show that human neurons do metabolize glucose through glycolysis and can rely on glycolysis to supply tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. To investigate the requirement for glycolysis, we generated mice with postnatal deletion of either the dominant neuronal glucose transporter (GLUT3cKO) or the neuronal-enriched pyruvate kinase isoform (PKM1cKO) in CA1 and other hippocampal neurons. GLUT3cKO and PKM1cKO mice show age-dependent learning and memory deficits. Hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging shows that female PKM1cKO mice have increased pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, whereas female GLUT3cKO mice have decreased conversion, body weight, and brain volume. GLUT3KO neurons also have decreased cytosolic glucose and ATP at nerve terminals, with spatial genomics and metabolomics revealing compensatory changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and galactose metabolism. Therefore, neurons metabolize glucose through glycolysis in vivo and require glycolysis for normal function.

Abstract: Summary
Transmembrane proteins must adopt proper topology to perform their functions. We previously demonstrated that ceramide regulates TM4SF20 (transmembrane 4 L6 family 20) by altering the topology of the transmembrane protein, but the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Here we report that TM4SF20 is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with a cytosolic C terminus and a luminal loop before the last transmembrane helix where N132, N148, and N163 are glycosylated. In the absence of ceramide, the sequence surrounding glycosylated N163 but not N132 is retrotranslocated from lumen to cytosol independent of ER-associated degradation. Accompanying this retrotranslocation, the C terminus of the protein is relocated from cytosol to lumen. Ceramide delays the retrotranslocation process, causing accumulation of the protein that is originally synthesized. Our findings suggest that N-linked glycans, although synthesized in the lumens, may be exposed to cytosol through retrotranslocation, a reaction that may play a crucial role in topological regulation of transmembrane proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Much progress has been made toward generating analogs of early embryos, such as gastruloids and embryoids, in vitro. However, methods for how to fully mimic the cell movements of gastrulation and coordinate germ-layer patterning to induce head formation are still lacking. Here, we show that a regional Nodal gradient applied to zebrafish animal pole explant can generate a structure that recapitulates the key cell movements of gastrulation. Using single-cell transcriptome and in situ hybridization analysis, we assess the dynamics of the cell fates and patterning of this structure. The mesendoderm differentiates into the anterior endoderm, prechordal plate, notochord, and tailbud-like cells along an anterior-posterior axis, and an anterior-posterior-patterned head-like structure (HLS) progressively forms during late gastrulation. Among 105 immediate Nodal targets, 14 genes contain axis-induction ability, and 5 of them induce a complete or partial head structure when overexpressed in the ventral side of zebrafish embryos.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of translation in astrocytes, the main glial cells in the brain, remains poorly characterized. We developed a high-throughput proteomics screen for polysome-associated proteins in astrocytes and focused on ribosomal protein receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1), a critical factor in translational regulation. In astrocyte somata and perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs), RACK1 preferentially binds to a number of mRNAs, including Kcnj10, encoding the inward-rectifying potassium (K+) channel Kir4.1. By developing an astrocyte-specific, conditional RACK1 knockout mouse model, we show that RACK1 represses production of Kir4.1 in hippocampal astrocytes and PAPs. Upregulation of Kir4.1 in the absence of RACK1 increases astrocytic Kir4.1-mediated K+ currents and volume. It also modifies neuronal activity attenuating burst frequency and duration. Reporter-based assays reveal that RACK1 controls Kcnj10 translation through the transcript’s 5′ untranslated region. Hence, translational regulation by RACK1 in astrocytes represses Kir4.1 expression and influences neuronal activity.

Abstract: Summary
Although oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a potent tumor-suppressor mechanism, recent studies revealed that cells could escape from OIS with features of transformed cells. However, the mechanisms that promote OIS escape remain unclear, and evidence of post-senescent cells in human cancers is missing. Here, we unravel the regulatory mechanisms underlying OIS escape using dynamic multidimensional profiling. We demonstrate a critical role for AP1 and POU2F2 transcription factors in escape from OIS and identify senescence-associated chromatin scars (SACSs) as an epigenetic memory of OIS detectable during colorectal cancer progression. POU2F2 levels are already elevated in precancerous lesions and as cells escape from OIS, and its expression and binding activity to cis-regulatory elements are associated with decreased patient survival. Our results support a model in which POU2F2 exploits a precoded enhancer landscape necessary for senescence escape and reveal POU2F2 and SACS gene signatures as valuable biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) has long been proposed to act as a global chromatin loop organizer in T cells. However, the exact functions of SATB1 in spatial genome organization remain elusive. Here we show that the depletion of SATB1 in human and murine T cells leads to transcriptional dysregulation for genes involved in T cell activation, as well as alterations of 3D genome architecture at multiple levels, including compartments, topologically associating domains, and loops. Importantly, SATB1 extensively colocalizes with CTCF throughout the genome. Depletion of SATB1 leads to increased chromatin contacts among and across the SATB1/CTCF co-occupied sites, thereby affecting the transcription of critical regulators of T cell activation. The loss of SATB1 does not affect CTCF occupancy but significantly reduces the retention of CTCF in the nuclear matrix. Collectively, our data show that SATB1 contributes to 3D genome organization by constraining chromatin topology surrounding CTCF-binding sites.

Abstract: Summary
The cortex has a disputed role in monitoring postural equilibrium and intervening in cases of major postural disturbances. Here, we investigate the patterns of neural activity in the cortex that underlie neural dynamics during unexpected perturbations. In both the primary sensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices of the rat, unique neuronal classes differentially covary their responses to distinguish different characteristics of applied postural perturbations; however, there is substantial information gain in M1, demonstrating a role for higher-order computations in motor control. A dynamical systems model of M1 activity and forces generated by the limbs reveals that these neuronal classes contribute to a low-dimensional manifold comprised of separate subspaces enabled by congruent and incongruent neural firing patterns that define different computations depending on the postural responses. These results inform how the cortex engages in postural control, directing work aiming to understand postural instability after neurological disease.

Abstract: Objective
Assessing the beneficial effects of silk sericin against hepatic injury induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN).
Methods
Aiming at promoting sericin as a natural product able to counteract the hazards of toxic elements, HPLC profile was conducted on the extracted sericin sample versus the standard one to qualitatively identify it. Following sericin treatment on human HepG2 liver cancer cells, many parameters were analyzed in vitro including cell viability, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis. Hepatic pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as histopathological and ultrastructure changes were evaluated in vivo in the different experimental groups.
Results
Sericin exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells with an IC50 of 14.12 + 0.75 μg/mL. The hepatotoxicity of DEN was manifested in mice by increased pro-inflammatory markers (IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α), decreased IL-10, liver structure deterioration, and characteristic histopathological and ultrastructure changes. Sericin administration reversed most of the observed alterations inflected by DEN.
Conclusions
Our results substantiate the sericin’s powerful apoptotic impact in vitro. In experimental mice, combination treatment using sericin together with melatonin appears to be more potent in mitigating the adverse effects of DEN. However, further investigations are needed to identify the underlying mechanism of action and complement the knowledge about the expected medicinal values of sericin.

Abstract: Summary
It is generally believed that environmental or cutaneous bacteria are the main origin of surgical infections. Therefore, measures to prevent postoperative infections focus on optimizing hygiene and improving asepsis and antisepsis. In a large cohort of patients with infections following major surgery, we identified that the causative bacteria are mainly of intestinal origin. Postoperative infections of intestinal origin were also found in mice undergoing partial hepatectomy. CCR6+ group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) limited systemic bacterial spread. Such bulwark function against host invasion required the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22), which controlled the expression of antimicrobial peptides in hepatocytes, thereby limiting bacterial spread. Using genetic loss-of-function experiments and punctual depletion of ILCs, we demonstrate that the failure to restrict intestinal commensals by ILC3s results in impaired liver regeneration. Our data emphasize the importance of endogenous intestinal bacteria as a source for postoperative infection and indicate ILC3s as potential new targets.

Abstract: Summary
Revealing early dynamic development of the normative cerebellar structures contributes to exploring cerebellum-related neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, leveraging infant-tailored cerebellar image processing techniques, we studied the dynamic volumetric developmental trajectories of cerebellum and 27 cerebellar sub-regions and their relationships with behavioral scores based on 511 high-resolution structural MRI scans during the first 800 postnatal days. The ratio of the entire cerebellum to the intracranial volume increases rapidly at first and then peaks at 13 months after birth. Both the absolute and relative volumes of most cerebellar sub-structures exhibit rapid increase at first, then the relative volumes decrease slightly after arriving at peaks (except for X lobules). Each lobule depicts larger absolute volume in males than in females. The within-subject variation of the cerebellar volumetric percentile score is generally stable. The volumetric development of several lobules (e.g., V, Crus I, and Crus II) has a significantly positive correlation with fine motor skills during the age range examined.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat and often results from new mutations. Antibiotics can induce mutations via mechanisms activated by stress responses, which both reveal environmental cues of mutagenesis and are weak links in mutagenesis networks. Network inhibition could slow the evolution of resistance during antibiotic therapies. Despite its pivotal importance, few identities and fewer functions of stress responses in mutagenesis are clear. Here, we identify the Escherichia coli stringent starvation response in fluoroquinolone-antibiotic ciprofloxacin-induced mutagenesis. Binding of response-activator ppGpp to RNA polymerase (RNAP) at two sites leads to an antibiotic-induced mutable gambler-cell subpopulation. Each activates a stress response required for mutagenic DNA-break repair: surprisingly, ppGpp-site-1-RNAP triggers the DNA-damage response, and ppGpp-site-2-RNAP induces σS-response activity. We propose that RNAP regulates DNA-damage processing in transcribed regions. The data demonstrate a critical node in ciprofloxacin-induced mutagenesis, imply RNAP-regulation of DNA-break repair, and identify promising targets for resistance-resisting drugs.

Abstract: Summary
While dysbiosis in the gut is implicated in the impaired induction of oral tolerance generated in mesenteric lymph nodes (MesLNs), how dysbiosis affects this process remains unclear. Here, we describe that antibiotic-driven gut dysbiosis causes the dysfunction of CD11c+CD103+ conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in MesLNs, preventing the establishment of oral tolerance. Deficiency of CD11c+CD103+ cDCs abrogates the generation of regulatory T cells in MesLNs to establish oral tolerance. Antibiotic treatment triggers the intestinal dysbiosis linked to the impaired generation of colony-stimulating factor 2 (Csf2)-producing group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) for regulating the tolerogenesis of CD11c+CD103+ cDCs and the reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A) on CD11c+CD103+ cDCs for generating Csf2-producing ILC3s. Thus, antibiotic-driven intestinal dysbiosis leads to the breakdown of crosstalk between CD11c+CD103+ cDCs and ILC3s for maintaining the tolerogenesis of CD11c+CD103+ cDCs in MesLNs, responsible for the failed establishment of oral tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
The chronic use of glucocorticoids decreases bone mass and quality and increases bone-marrow adiposity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that bone-marrow adipocyte (BMAd) lineage cells in adult mice undergo rapid cellular senescence upon glucocorticoid treatment. The senescent BMAds acquire a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which spreads senescence in bone and bone marrow. Mechanistically, glucocorticoids increase the synthesis of oxylipins, such as 15d-PGJ2, for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activation. PPARγ stimulates the expression of key senescence genes and also promotes oxylipin synthesis in BMAds, forming a positive feedback loop. Transplanting senescent BMAds into the bone marrow of healthy mice is sufficient to induce the secondary spread of senescent cells and bone-loss phenotypes, whereas transplanting BMAds harboring a p16INK4a deletion did not show such effects. Thus, glucocorticoid treatment induces a lipid metabolic circuit that robustly triggers the senescence of BMAd lineage cells that, in turn, act as the mediators of glucocorticoid-induced bone deterioration.

Abstract: Summary
Cell classes in the human retina are highly heterogeneous with their abundance varying by several orders of magnitude. Here, we generated and integrated a multi-omics single-cell atlas of the adult human retina, including more than 250,000 nuclei for single-nuclei RNA-seq and 137,000 nuclei for single-nuclei ATAC-seq. Cross-species comparison of the retina atlas among human, monkey, mice, and chicken revealed relatively conserved and non-conserved types. Interestingly, the overall cell heterogeneity in primate retina decreases compared with that of rodent and chicken retina. Through integrative analysis, we identified 35,000 distal cis-element-gene pairs, constructed transcription factor (TF)-target regulons for more than 200 TFs, and partitioned the TFs into distinct co-active modules. We also revealed the heterogeneity of the cis-element-gene relationships in different cell types, even from the same class. Taken together, we present a comprehensive single-cell multi-omics atlas of the human retina as a resource that enables systematic molecular characterization at individual cell-type resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt and Rspondin (RSPO) signaling drives proliferation, and bone morphogenetic protein inhibitors (BMPi) impede differentiation, of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Here, we identify the mouse ISC niche as a complex, multi-layered structure that encompasses distinct mesenchymal and smooth muscle populations. In young and adult mice, diverse sub-cryptal cells provide redundant ISC-supportive factors; few of these are restricted to single cell types. Niche functions refine during postnatal crypt morphogenesis, in part to oppose the dense aggregation of differentiation-promoting BMP+ sub-epithelial myofibroblasts at crypt-villus junctions. Muscularis mucosae, a specialized muscle layer, first appears during this period and supplements neighboring RSPO and BMPi sources. Components of this developing niche are conserved in human fetuses. The in vivo ablation of mouse postnatal smooth muscle increases BMP signaling activity, potently limiting a pre-weaning burst of crypt fission. Thus, distinct and progressively specialized mesenchymal cells together create the milieu that is required to propagate crypts during rapid organ growth and to sustain adult ISCs.

Abstract: Summary
Associations between human genetic variation and clinical phenotypes have become a foundation of biomedical research. Most repositories of these data seek to be disease-agnostic and therefore lack disease-focused views. The Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (T2DKP) is a public resource of genetic datasets and genomic annotations dedicated to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits. Here, we seek to make the T2DKP more accessible to prospective users and more useful to existing users. First, we evaluate the T2DKP’s comprehensiveness by comparing its datasets with those of other repositories. Second, we describe how researchers unfamiliar with human genetic data can begin using and correctly interpreting them via the T2DKP. Third, we describe how existing users can extend their current workflows to use the full suite of tools offered by the T2DKP. We finally discuss the lessons offered by the T2DKP toward the goal of democratizing access to complex disease genetic results.

Abstract: Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles presenting on the surface of most postmitotic mammalian cells. As being signaling hubs and sensory organelles, primary cilia can respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli from the extracellular environment. Arl13b (ADP-ribosylation factor-like 13B), an atypical Arf/Arl family GTPase, was identified in genetic screening as a protein essential for maintaining the integrity of cilia and neural tubes. Previous studies on Arl13b have mostly focused on its role in the development of neural tubes, polycystic kidneys, and tumors, but no role in bone patterns was described. This study reported the essential roles of Arl13b in bone formation and osteogenic differentiation. Arl13b was highly expressed in bone tissues and osteoblasts, positively correlated with osteogenic activity during bone development. Furthermore, Arl13b was essential for primary cilium maintenance and Hedgehog signaling activation in osteoblasts. Arl13b knockdown in osteoblasts decreased the length of primary cilia and the upregulated levels of Gli1, Smo, and Ptch1 upon Smo agonist treatment. Additionally, Arl13b knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, Arl13b mediated osteogenesis and cell mechanosensation. Cyclic tension strain upregulated the Arl13b expression. Arl13b knockdown suppressed osteogenesis and mitigated cyclic tension strain-induced osteogenesis. These results suggest that Arl13b have important roles in bone formation and mechanosensation.

Abstract: Summary
Nanoplastics (NPs) as contaminants in food and water have drawn increasing public attention. However, little is known about how NPs shape the gut immune landscape after injection. In this study, we fabricate NPs (∼500 nm) and microplastics (MPs) (∼2 μm) and evaluate their in vivo effects by feeding them to mice. The results suggest that NPs show a better ability to induce gut macrophage activation than MPs. In addition, NPs trigger gut interleukin-1 (IL-1)-producing macrophage reprogramming via inducing lysosomal damage. More importantly, IL-1 signaling from the intestine can affect brain immunity, leading to microglial activation and Th17 differentiation, all of which correlates with a decline in cognitive and short-term memory in NP-fed mice. Thus, this study provides insight into the mechanism of action of the gut-brain axis, delineates the way NPs reduce brain function, and highlights the importance of fixing the plastic pollution problem worldwide.

Abstract: Summary
Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability worldwide, and better drugs are needed to promote functional recovery after stroke. Growing evidence suggests the critical role of network excitability during the repair phase for stroke recovery. Here, we show that β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), an essential ketone body (KB) component, is positively correlated with improved outcomes in patients with stroke and promotes functional recovery in rodents with stroke during the repair phase. These beneficial effects of β-HB depend on HDAC2/HDAC3-GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) signaling-mediated enhancement of excitability and phasic GABA inhibition in the peri-infarct cortex and structural and functional plasticity in the ipsilateral cortex, the contralateral cortex, and the corticospinal tract. Together with available clinical approaches to elevate KB levels, our results offer a clinically translatable means to promote stroke recovery. Furthermore, GAT-1 can serve as a pharmacological target for developing drugs to promote functional recovery after stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Subunit vaccines typically require co-administration with an adjuvant to elicit protective immunity, adding development hurdles that can impede rapid pandemic responses. To circumvent the need for adjuvant in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subunit vaccine, we engineer a thermostable immunotargeting vaccine (ITV) that leverages the pan-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody 44H10 to deliver the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to antigen-presenting cells. X-ray crystallography shows that 44H10 binds to a conserved epitope on HLA-DR, providing the basis for its broad HLA-DR reactivity. Adjuvant-free ITV immunization in rabbits and ferrets induces robust anti-RBD antibody responses that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and protect recipients from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We demonstrate that the modular nature of the ITV scaffold with respect to helper T cell epitopes and diverse RBD antigens facilitates broad sarbecovirus neutralization. Our findings support anti-HLA-DR immunotargeting as an effective means to induce strong antibody responses to subunit antigens without requiring an adjuvant.

Abstract: Summary
Proper defense against microbial infection depends on the controlled activation of the immune system. This is particularly important for the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which recognize viral dsRNA and initiate antiviral innate immune responses with the potential of triggering systemic inflammation and immunopathology. Here, we show that stress granules (SGs), molecular condensates that form in response to various stresses including viral dsRNA, play key roles in the controlled activation of RLR signaling. Without the SG nucleators G3BP1/2 and UBAP2L, dsRNA triggers excessive inflammation and immune-mediated apoptosis. In addition to exogenous dsRNA, host-derived dsRNA generated in response to ADAR1 deficiency is also controlled by SG biology. Intriguingly, SGs can function beyond immune control by suppressing viral replication independently of the RLR pathway. These observations thus highlight the multi-functional nature of SGs as cellular “shock absorbers” that converge on protecting cell homeostasis by dampening both toxic immune response and viral replication.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression in metazoans is controlled by promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II, which can undergo productive elongation or promoter-proximal termination. Integrator-PP2A (INTAC) plays a crucial role in determining the fate of paused polymerases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we establish a rapid degradation system to dissect the functions of INTAC RNA endonuclease and phosphatase modules. We find that both catalytic modules function at most if not all active promoters and enhancers, yet differentially affect polymerase fate. The endonuclease module induces promoter-proximal termination, with its disruption leading to accumulation of elongation-incompetent polymerases and downregulation of highly expressed genes, while elongation-competent polymerases accumulate at lowly expressed genes and non-coding elements, leading to their upregulation. The phosphatase module primarily prevents the release of paused polymerases and limits transcriptional activation, especially for highly paused genes. Thus, both INTAC catalytic modules have unexpectedly general yet distinct roles in dynamic transcriptional control.

Abstract: Lipid oxidation products, including lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), accumulate at the site of arterial injury after vascular interventions and hinder re-endothelization. LysoPC activates calcium-permeable channels, specifically canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channels that induce a sustained increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration [Ca2+]i and contribute to dysregulation of the endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeleton. Activation of TRPC6 leads to inhibition of EC migration in vitro and delayed re-endothelization of arterial injuries in vivo. Previously, we demonstrated the role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), specifically calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2), in lysoPC-induced TRPC6 externalization and inhibition of EC migration in vitro. The ability of FKGK11, an iPLA2-specific pharmacological inhibitor, to block TRPC6 externalization and preserve EC migration was assessed in vitro and in a mouse model of carotid injury. Our data suggest that FKGK11 prevents lysoPC-induced PLA2 activity, blocks TRPC6 externalization, attenuates calcium influx, and partially preserves EC migration in vitro. Furthermore, FKGK11 promotes re-endothelization of an electrocautery carotid injury in hypercholesterolemic mice. FKGK11 has similar arterial healing effects in male and female mice on a high-fat diet. This study suggests that iPLA2 is a potential therapeutic target to attenuate calcium influx through TRPC6 channels and promote EC healing in cardiovascular patients undergoing angioplasty.

Abstract: Summary
Paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing (scRNA/TCR-seq) has allowed for enhanced resolution of clonal T cell dynamics in cancer. Here, we report a scRNA/TCR-seq analysis of 187,650 T cells from 31 tissue regions, including tumor, adjacent normal tissues, and lymph nodes (LN), from three patients with non-small cell lung cancer after immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Regions with viable cancer cells are enriched for exhausted CD8+ T cells, regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg), and follicular helper CD4+ T cells (TFH). Tracking T cell clonotypes across tissues, combined with neoantigen specificity assays, reveals that TFH and tumor-specific exhausted CD8+ T cells are clonally linked to TCF7+ SELL+ progenitors in tumor draining LNs, and progressive exhaustion trajectories of CD8+ T, Treg, and TFH cells with proximity to the tumor microenvironment. Finally, longitudinal tracking of tumor-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones reveals persistence in the peripheral blood for years after ICB therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Histone chaperones are an important class of proteins that regulate chromatin accessibility for DNA-templated processes. Spt6 is a conserved histone chaperone and key regulator of transcription and chromatin structure. However, its functions outside of these roles have been little explored. In this work, we demonstrate a requirement for S. cerevisiae Spt6 in DNA replication and, more broadly, as a regulator of genome stability. Depletion or mutation of Spt6 impairs DNA replication in vivo. Additionally, spt6 mutants are sensitive to DNA replication stress-inducing agents. Interestingly, this sensitivity is independent of the association of Spt6 with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), suggesting that spt6 mutants have a transcription-independent impairment of DNA replication. Specifically, genomic studies reveal that spt6 mutants have decreased loading of the MCM replicative helicase at replication origins, suggesting that Spt6 promotes origin licensing. Our results identify Spt6 as a regulator of genome stability, at least in part through a role in DNA replication.
