Abstract: Er3+–Yb3+ co-doped transparent glass-ceramics with varying Er/Yb content and ratio have been prepared. High quantum yields for up- and down-conversion luminescence by energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ and from Er3+ to Yb3+, respectively, have been detected and optimized with respect to the Er/Yb content and ratio, and proposed in particular for up- and down-conversion of solar spectrum for enhancement of the efficiency of solar cells. The rise and decay kinetics for the population of the excited levels of Er3+ and Yb3+ have been studied and fit. Based on these experimental data, the mechanisms for the energy transfers have been suggested with emphasis on the optimized Er/Yb content and ratio for enhancement of the efficiency of the Er3+↔Yb3+ energy transfers.

Abstract: New series of thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione(TPD)-based small molecules with donor–acceptor–donor structure were synthesized by palladium(0)-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. The thermal, electrochemical, optical, charge transport, and photovoltaic properties of these small molecules were examined. These molecules exhibit strong absorption at 460–490nm and low HOMO levels (−5.26 to −5.34eV). Field-effect hole mobilities of these molecules are 0.8–1.3×10−3cm2V−1s−1. Solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on the blends of these molecule donors and PC71BM acceptor exhibit power conversion efficiencies as high as 3.31% under AM1.5, 100mWcm−2.

Abstract: A majority of cells obtain of transferrin (Tf) bound iron via transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) or by transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) in hepatocytes. Our study establishes that cells are capable of acquiring transferrin iron by an alternate pathway via GAPDH. These findings demonstrate that upon iron depletion, GAPDH functions as a preferred receptor for transferrin rather than TfR1 in some but not all cell types. We utilized CHO-TRVb cells that do not express TfR1 or TfR2 as a model system. A knockdown of GAPDH in these cells resulted in a decrease of not only transferrin binding but also associated iron uptake. The current study also demonstrates that, unlike TfR1 and TfR2 which are localized to a specific membrane fraction, GAPDH is located in both the detergent soluble and lipid raft fractions of the cell membrane. Further, transferrin uptake by GAPDH occurs by more than one mechanism namely clathrin mediated endocytosis, lipid raft endocytosis and macropinocytosis. By determining the kinetics of this pathway it appears that GAPDH–Tf uptake is a low affinity, high capacity, recycling pathway wherein transferrin is catabolised. Our findings provide an explanation for the detailed role of GAPDH mediated transferrin uptake as an alternate route by which cells acquire iron.

Thioredoxin-1 and protein disulfide isomerase catalyze the reduction of similar disulfides in HIV gp120,

Abstract: HIV-1 enters cells via interaction of the viral glycoprotein gp120, the host cell surface receptor CD4 and the co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. For entry, gp120 undergoes conformational changes that depend on the reduction of one or more disulfides. Previous studies indicate that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), and glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1) catalyze gp120 reduction, but their specific disulfide targets are not known. Here, it was demonstrated that PDI and Trx1 have similar gp120 disulfide targets as determined by labeling after reduction, but with some pattern differences, including overall stronger labeling with Trx1 than with PDI. Furthermore, uneven labeling of the residues of a disulfide may reflect altered accessibility by conformational changes upon the reduction process. Since both PDI and Trx1 may be involved in viral entry, compounds that target the host redox system or the viral gp120 were tested in vitro to investigate whether redox regulation is a target for anti-HIV therapy. Carbohydrate binding agents (CBAs), previously shown to bind gp120 and inhibit HIV entry, were now demonstrated to inhibit gp120 disulfide reduction. Auranofin, an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), also showed inhibitory activity towards HIV infection, although close to its cytotoxic concentration. Our results demonstrate that both the host redox system and the viral surface glycoproteins are of interest for the development of new generations of anti-HIV therapeutics.

Abstract: Epinephrine is one of the major hormones involved in glucose counter-regulation and gluconeogenesis. However, little is known about its importance in energy homeostasis during fasting. Our objective is to study the specific role of epinephrine in glucose and lipid metabolism during starvation. In our experiment, we subject regular mice and epinephrine-deficient mice to a 48-h fast then we evaluate the different metabolic responses to fasting. Our results show that epinephrine is not required for glucose counter-regulation: epinephrine-deficient mice maintain their blood glucose at normal fasting levels via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, with normal fasting-induced changes in the peroxisomal activators: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator α (PGC-1α), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPAR-α), and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1c). However, fasted epinephrine-deficient mice develop severe ketosis and hepatic steatosis, with evidence for inhibition of hepatic autophagy, a process that normally provides essential energy via degradation of hepatic triglycerides during starvation. We conclude that, during fasting, epinephrine is not required for glucose homeostasis, lipolysis or ketogenesis. Epinephrine may have an essential role in lipid handling, possibly via an autophagy-dependent mechanism.

Abstract: Mortalin binds to p53 tumor suppressor protein and sequesters it in the cytoplasm. This results in an inhibition of the transcriptional activation and control of centrosome duplication functions of p53, thus contributing to human carcinogenesis. Abrogation of mortalin–p53 interaction and reactivation of p53 function could be a valid proposition for cancer therapy. In the present study, we first investigated in silico the interaction of withanone, a withanolide with anticancer activity, with mortalin. We found that withanone could bind to mortalin in a region, earlier predicted critical for binding to p53. Cationic rhodacyanine dye, MKT-077 has also shown to bind the same region and kill cancer cells selectively. We report the molecular dynamic simulations revealing the thermodynamic and structural stability of the withanone–mortalin complexes. We also demonstrate the experimental evidence of abrogation of mortalin–p53 complex by withanone resulting in nuclear translocation and functional reactivation of p53 in human cancer cells. The present study establishes a molecular interaction basis that could be used for screening and development of anticancer drugs with low toxicity to normal cells. Accurate knowledge of the 3D structure of mortalin would further enhance the potential of such analyses to understand the molecular basis of mortalin biology and mortalin based cancer therapy.

Abstract: Thin films of mesoporous lamellar nickel oxides and nanotube manganese oxides were electrochemically fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass using sodium n-dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a template agent under different controlled potentials in 10mM Ni(NO3)2 and 100mM MnSO4 solutions. Electrochromic characterization together with the morphological observation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), structure analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron diffraction (ED) was made. Nickel and manganese oxide films of nanostructures, compared with conventional structure ones, showed marked changes in optical transmittance and electric charge with regard to the electrochromic reactions in aqueous solution of 100mM LiOH. However, in a non-aqueous γ-butyrolactone (GBL) solution of 100mM Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium, the nickel oxide films did not show any notable electrochromic reactions, while the manganese oxide films of both nanostructure and conventional structure are electrochromically active and the effect of nanostructure on the electrochromic properties was remarkable.

Abstract: In this study, we used transparent and conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) nanorods, prepared through electron-beam evaporation onto ITO glass substrates, as electrodes for viologen-based electrochromic devices (ECDs). Although the shapes of these ITO nanorods could be controlled simply by manipulating the evaporation time, they always maintained their high optical transmittance. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the ITO rods were uniformly distributed on the ITO glass; they had large surface areas for the tethering of electrochromic molecules. As a result, the ITO nanorods functioned as optical amplifiers in the viologen-based ECDs, increasing the color contrast [ΔT (%)] from 38% to 61%.

Abstract: Previously, we reported 15.4%-efficient [1] copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS)-based photovoltaic devices from electrodeposited precursor films in which the final film composition was adjusted using the physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. At present, we are fabricating CIGS-based solar cells directly from electrodeposited precursor films, eliminating the expensive PVD step. Electrodeposited CIGS absorber layers are fabricated by a three-stage electrodeposition process in which: (a) CIGS is electrodeposited in the first stage, (b) Cu is electrodeposited in the second stage, and (c) an In layer is deposited in the final third stage. All films are electrodeposited from an aqueous-based solution at room temperature in a two-electrode cell configuration, with platinum gauze as the counter electrode and a glass/MO substrate as the working electrode. The substrate is DC-sputtered with about 1μm of Mo. The electrodeposited films are selenized at high temperature (∼550°C) to obtain a 10.9%-efficient device.

Abstract: The effects of copper nanowires (Cu NWs) with ultra-high aspect ratio and sponge-like structure on the properties of an organic phase change material (PCM) were investigated. Tetradecanol (TD) was selected as the organic PCM. The sponge-like Cu NWs clusters were randomly dispersed in the TD matrix and were wrapped by TD to form a new kind of composite PCM. The phase change enthalpy (ΔH) of the composite PCMs was decreased linearly with the increasing of Cu NWs loading, while the melting speed was accelerated. The thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs was greatly enhanced by Cu NWs. The ΔH of the composite PCM containing 58.9wt% (corresponding to 11.9vol%) of Cu NWs was 86.95J/g, and the thermal conductivity attained to 2.86W/mK, which was nearly 9 times higher than that of the TD. The thermal conductivity enhancement of Cu NWs on the composite PCMs showed a turning point at the Cu NWs loading of 1.5vol%. When Cu NWs loading exceeded 1.5vol%, the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs increased significantly faster with the increasing of Cu NWs loading.

Abstract: Inexpensive solution processing of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells offers an attractive option for the low cost solar energy conversion. Solution processing creates a disordered morphology consisting of two organic semiconductors, intermixed randomly within the light-absorbing layer of the cell. In this paper, we use a detailed three-dimensional process-device co-modeling framework to show that in spite of the inherent structural randomness of the morphology, the efficiency of solution-processed BHJ cells is nearly optimal – close to those of the perfectly ordered structures. In addition, we show that the morphological randomness by itself does not increase the performance variability of large-area cells. Both the results indicate that the inexpensive solution processing of BHJ cells imposes no inherent limitation on the performance/variability and the ultimate efficiency of such solution-processed films should compare favorably to the other ordered OPV cells fabricated by more expensive techniques. Finally, we explore the theoretical optimum morphology for BHJ cells and find that fill factor is the only parameter through which efficiency can be enhanced by morphology engineering. We conclude by exploring the performance gains/limits of organic solar cells with the improvement in transport parameters.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) are rare uterine neoplasms. Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment for early stages and consists of an abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy. Despite appropriate surgical treatment, relapse rates are high (18% to 45%) and the value of adjuvant therapies is not clear. We evaluated prognostic factors and the impact of adjuvant treatment on localized ESS (stages I and II).
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective, case-control study conducted at the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat, Morocco over 10 years from 2000 to 2009.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Twenty-one cases of localized ESS were included in the analysis.
RESULTS
Standard surgery was performed in 71.4% of our patients. Myometrial invasion was noted in 57.1% of cases. Mitotic activity was considered high in five patients. Adjuvant treatment was given to 52.3% of patients: endocrine therapy in five patients and radiotherapy in six. Survival was significantly longer in the group of patients who underwent standard surgical treatment (P=.0007), in the absence of deep myometrial invasion (P=.0248) in cases with a low mitotic index (P<.0001) and in patients who received adjuvant therapy (hormone or radiotherapy) (P=.0048). In a multivariate analysis independent risk factors for monitoring were inadequate surgical treatment and absence of adjuvant treatment.
CONCLUSIONS
Myometrial invasion and mitotic index appear to be important prognostic factors. The reference surgery is hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy. Lymph node dissection does not appear to provide a benefit. Finally adjuvant treatment may carry a significant survival benefit.

Abstract: Substance P as a member of tachykinin family plays an important role in angiogenesis. Hemokinins (HKs) have been identified as new members of substance P-like peptides of tachykinin family. However, the effects of HKs on endothelial cells and angiogenesis have not been studied. For the first time, here we demonstrated that r/mHK-1, hHK-1 and hHK(4-11) dose-dependently stimulated the proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation of freshly isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and further exhibited in vivo angiogenic effects in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model. The angiogenic effects of HKs were inhibited by the selective antagonist of neurokinin-1 rather than neurokinin-2 receptor. Mechanistically, HKs activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, stimulated nitric oxide production, and upregulated the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HUVECs. Taken together, our data suggest that HKs emerge as pivotal endogenous regulators of angiogenesis and represent potential targets for the intervention of angiogenesis in different pathological conditions given their specific peripheral distribution.

Abstract: A new series of pyrrole family, N-substituted phenyl attached alkyl at the ortho, meta and para position were synthesized by a straight forward method and were exploited as an innovative monomer for electroactive polymers. Ionic liquids were employed as a medium for electro-polymerization of these monomers to obtain N-(methyl)phenyl polypyrroles. N-substituted polypyrroles show different morphologies and conductivity according to position of methyl group on the benzene ring and synthesis medium. The electrical conductivity value varies with the position of methyl group and was >10−5S/cm, higher than the sample obtained from conventional media. The resulting polymer films were characterized by FT-IR and UV–Vis spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, cyclic voltammetry and scanning probe microscopic technique along with their electrochromic behavior.

Abstract: Although embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived hepatocytes have the capacity for liver engraftment and repopulation, their in vivo hepatic function has not been analyzed yet. We aimed to determine the metabolic function and therapeutic action of ES cell-derived hepatocytes after serial liver repopulations in fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase knockout (Fah−/−) mice. Albumin expressing (Alb+) cells were obtained by hepatic differentiation of ES cells using two frequently reported methods. After transplantation, variable levels of liver repopulation were found in Fah−/− mice recipients. FAH expressing (FAH+) hepatocytes were found either as single cells or as nodules with multiple hepatocytes. After serial transplantation, the proportion of the liver that was repopulated by the re-transplanted FAH+ hepatocytes increased significantly. ES cell-derived FAH+ hepatocytes were found in homogenous nodules and corrected the liver metabolic disorder of Fah−/− recipients and rescued them from death. ES cell-derived hepatocytes had normal karyotype, hepatocytic morphology and metabolic function both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, ES cell-derived hepatocytes were capable of liver repopulation and correction of metabolic defects after serial transplantation. Our results are an important piece of evidence to support future clinical applications of ES cell-derived hepatocytes in treating liver diseases.

Abstract: A novel method forms less than 100μm wide self-aligned local contacts through an amorphous silicon based passivation layer stack on crystalline silicon solar cells. Wire shading during the plasma deposition of the passivation layer enables local contact formation without the use of photolithography or laser processes. Subsequent full area aluminum evaporation and thermal annealing create good electrical contacts. The structure combines a low effective surface recombination velocity 36cm/s and high implied open circuit voltage 715mV with a good ohmic contact for the rear side of p-type crystalline silicon solar cells.

Abstract: In this work, fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), photoluminescence (PL), optical and transient absorption (UV–vis & TA) spectroscopies have been used to monitor charge transfer from excited conjugated polymer (MEH-PPV) to smaller sized (5–7nm) monodispersive CdSe quantum dots (QD) prepared by the chemical route using different capping ligands as trioctyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) and oleic acid (OA). CdSe (OA) QD's (∼7nm) owing to its relatively smaller surface energies compared with CdSe (TOPO) QD's (∼5nm) shows lesser quenching capabilities within the MEH-PPV polymer matrix. These studies demonstrate dominance of respective processes of photoinduced Förster energy transfer between host polymer (donors) and guest CdSe nanocrystals (acceptors) in polymer:CdSe(OA) nanocomposites and charge transfer in polymer:CdSe(TOPO) nanocomposites. Due to limitations of our nanosecond laser flash photolysis apparatus, transient absorption signatures of positive polaron of MEH-PPV could not be detected since it exhibits characteristic absorption in the mid-IR region. However, signatures of transient corresponding to CdSe−⁎ radical in the visible region was seen only when the sample was excited in the presence of polymer (MEH-PPV). A model has been proposed, which elucidate the possibility to modulate charge/energy transfer rate between polymer and semiconductor quantum dots using a suitable ligand-exchange process. The various characterization techniques used in this work provide an insight into the charge separation, charge accumulation and/or trapping of charge carriers for the better understanding of hybrid organic–inorganic photovoltaics.

Abstract: SiO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) are fabricated on InGaN-based multiple quantum well (MQW) solar cells using self-assembled Ag nanoparticles as the etching mask and subsequent reactive ion etching. The SiO2 NRAs effectively suppress the undesired surface reflections over the wavelengths from 330 to 570nm, which is attributed to the light-trapping effect and the improved mismatch of refractive index at the air/MQW device interface. Under the air mass 1.5 global illumination, the conversion efficiency of the solar cell is enhanced by ∼21% largely due to increased short-circuit current from 0.71 to 0.76mA/cm2. The enhanced device performances by the optical absorption improvement are supported by the simulation analysis as well.

Abstract: A series of low bandgap copolymers based on cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and thienopyrroledione have been synthesized and characterized. High average molecular weight copolymers could be synthesized by microwave assisted polymerization methods with significantly reduced polymerization times. The copolymers exhibited broad absorption in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum (∼400–700nm), which is a prerequisite for photovoltaic applications. Copolymers P2 and P3 containing thiophene spacers showed a broader absorption with a slightly blue shifted absorption maxima compared to that of P1 due to the loss in the coplanarity of the polymer backbone. All copolymers possess fairly low bandgaps (∼1.7eV) and deep highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices fabricated from the copolymers and PC71BM gave power conversion efficiencies as high as 3.10% for the P1 devices under illumination of AM1.5G 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: Vibrio cholerae induces acute inflammatory response at intestinal epithelial surface; the underlying cellular immune mechanisms for such effects are largely unexplored. Mucosal immune response is controlled by crosstalk between the intestinal epithelial cells (ECs) and dendritic cells (DCs). An EC-derived cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been found a critical regulator of several human inflammatory conditions. TSLP is highly elevated in ECs stimulated with V. cholerae and its recombinant flagellin (rFlaA). V. cholerae treated human ECs produce DC-attracting chemokine MIP-3α (CCL20). Flagellin, a potent V. cholerae factor was responsible for maximum stimulation of epithelial CCL20 production and subsequent DC activation. Activated DCs express high levels of costimulatory molecules and secrete inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. Bacteria stimulated ECs conditioned DCs to produce Th2 cell-attracting chemokines CCL17 and CCL22. TSLP and other mediators present in the V. cholerae stimulated EC-culture filtrate potently activated DCs, which subsequently primed CD4+T cells to differentiate into T helper type 2 (Th2) cells that produce high amounts of IL-4, IL-13 and TNF-α and low IFN-γ. TSLP-induced proinflammatory response in DCs involved the transcriptional mechanisms, MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38 and JNK) and STAT3 activation. This study suggests TSLP and other mediators released from ECs in response to V. cholerae colonization actively influence DCs in initiating inflammatory response.

Abstract: The use of Indium–Tin Oxide (ITO) as a transparent conductor in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices has been shown to present a bottleneck for the technology due to the use of the rare metal Indium and also the energy intensive manufacturing processes required and subsequent high economic cost. This study discusses some of the alternative materials, which are being considered for use as transparent conductors in OPV modules. A life cycle and cost analysis of a number of the most promising ITO-free transparent conductors, namely: high conductivity PEDOT:PSS; a silver grid embedded in PEDOT:PSS; silver nanowires; single walled carbon nanotubes are completed in this study. The results show that there is great potential for reducing both the energy pay-back time and the cost of OPV modules by replacing ITO with an alternative transparent conductor.

Abstract: In the intestine, dysregulation of miRNA is associated with inflammation, disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier, and the onset of gastrointestinal disorders. This study identifies miRNAs involved in the maintenance of intercellular junctions and barrier integrity. For the functional identification of barrier affecting miRNAs, we took advantage of the barrier-enforcing effects of the probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) which can be monitored by enhanced transepithelial resistance (TER). miRNA-profiling of T84 monolayers prior and after co-incubation with EcN revealed for the first time differentially regulated miRNAs (miR-203, miR-483-3p, miR-595) targeting tight junction (TJ) proteins. Using real-time PCR, Western blotting and specific miRNA mimics, we showed that these miRNAs are involved in the regulation of barrier function by modulating the expression of regulatory and structural components of tight junctional complexes. Furthermore, specific inhibitors directed at these miRNA abrogated the disturbance of tight junctions induced by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined to 340nM by monitoring inhibitor kinetics. In summary, we conclude that specific miRNAs effect regulatory as well as structural proteins of the junctional complex which in turn are involved in the barrier enhancing effect of EcN. Hence, we suggest that the application of miRNAs might be refined and further developed as a novel supportive strategy for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.

Apo- and holo-lactoferrin stimulate proliferation of mouse crypt cells but through different cellular signaling pathways,

Abstract: Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding glycoprotein in human milk, plays an important role in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cascades are chief pathways controlling cell proliferation. We hypothesized that Lf stimulates proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells by activating ERK and PI3K signaling cascades and that lactoferrin receptor (LfR) is involved in these processes. Confocal microscopy showed that LfR is expressed and localized at the plasma membrane of mouse crypt cells isolated from 7 to 10 days old pups, specifically binding both iron-free Lf (apo-Lf) and iron-saturated Lf (holo-Lf). Using the BrdU assay, we observed that apo-Lf had a stronger stimulatory effect than holo-Lf on proliferation of crypt cells. Both function-blocking antibody against LfR and MEK inhibitor (U0126) resulted in inhibitory effects on apo-Lf-induced cell proliferation, whereas PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) significantly decreased both apo- and holo-Lf-induced proliferation. Although both apo- and holo-Lf up-regulated transcription of cyclin D1, an effector of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, only apo-Lf initiated ERK1/2 signaling and both apo- and holo-Lf were capable of activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Function-blocking antibody against LfR and LfR siRNA inhibited apo-Lf induced activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, suggesting that LfR is involved in apo-Lf induced activation of the ERK1/2, but not the PI3K signaling pathway. In conclusion, apo-Lf and holo-Lf stimulate intestinal proliferation but through different signaling pathways.

Abstract: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the one-at-a-time deletions of either the high-affinity glucose sensor gene SNF3 or the low-affinity glucose sensor gene RGT2 only slightly reduced pexophagy; however, deleting both genes greatly reduced pexophagy, evincing interaction beyond the sum of the additive effects, as recently shown. The present study identifies the only ScSNF3/RGT2 ortholog in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (designated as PpGSS1, from GlucoSe Sensor) and describes its roles in autophagic pathways (non-selective and selective). GSS1 knock-out strain has been constructed. The experiments support the hypothesis that Gss1 plays an important role in autophagic degradation of peroxisomes and glucose catabolite repression in P. pastoris.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and toxicity of docetaxel as first-line chemotherapy or in previously treated patients (one regimen) with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Prospective phase II study in patients referred to the Department of Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Fifty patients with advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer were enrolled to receive docetaxel 70mg/m2 administered intravenously on day 1 of a 3-week cycle. If patients responded well to docetaxel, additional cycles were administered until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Therapy response was evaluated every 6 weeks.
RESULTS
Of 50 patients with a median age of 60 years (range, 40–70years) who entered the study, 17 patients (34%) had received one prior chemotherapy regimen. All patients were evaluable for efficacy, yielding an overall response rate of 34% (95% confidence interval, 14.8%–55.6%); complete response and partial response (PR) were 4% and 30%, respectively. Of 17 pretreated patients, 5 (29%) had a PR. The median duration of response was 2 months. The median time-to-progression was 4 months and the median survival time was 18 months. The predominant toxicity was grade 3–4 neutropenia, occurring in 92% of the patients, although febrile neutropenia arose in 10% of the patients. Edema was mild and infrequent.
CONCLUSION
The study clearly demonstrated that docetaxel is active in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Toxicity was manageable and predominantly hematologic.

Abstract: We here report on our investigation of the properties of polysiloxane rubber waveguides doped with Lumogen Red 305 for the production of luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) devices. Samples with different dye concentrations were produced and their optical properties were characterized by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. Moreover, different concentrations of Au nanoparticles were dispersed in the matrix in order to study the possibility of enhancing the fluorophore fluorescence yield. The light output from the edges of the samples, irradiated with a solar simulator was measured with an integrating sphere and the light yield was compared to that obtained with polycarbonate waveguides containing the same amount of the fluorescent dye BASF Lumogen Red305. Preliminary results from measurements with a GaAs photovoltaic cell and a silicon photodiode coupled to the polysiloxane waveguides are also presented.

Abstract: The modules with holes on the counter electrode substrate for photocurrent collection with thin wires were investigated by simulation. This type of module can perform high efficiency for its high open area ratio. An improved model based on our previous work was used to optimize this type of module. By simulation, we found that hexagonal cell is the best choice for this kind of module, and the optimized length of silver finger is related to the assemblage technique. Open area ratio of more than 90% and aperture area efficiency of more than 10% can be easily achieved based on the small area cell with efficiency of 11.1%.

Abstract: We present our research and development of fabricating μc-Si:H bottom cells on a-Si:H/a-Si:H double-junction solar cells made in a commercial production line to make a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H triple-junction solar cells. The μc-Si:H bottom cells were deposited in a single-chamber system. We studied the n/p tunnel junction between the a-Si:H middle and μc-Si:H bottom cells by optimizing the hydrogen plasma treatment time, the μc-Si:H n layer, and the μc-Si:H p layer. We found that a proper combination of the three key elements can form a high-quality n/p tunnel junction with electrical and optical properties suitable for the triple-junction solar cells. We used the optimized n/p tunnel junction in a-Si:H/a-Si:H/μc-Si:H p–i–n-type triple-junction solar cells and improved the cell performance significantly, mainly from the increased open-circuit voltage and fill factor. We further optimized the μc-Si:H bottom cells. Combining the optimized n/p tunnel junction and high performance μc-Si:H bottom cell, we made a-Si:H/a-Si:H/nc-Si:H triple-junction solar cells having an initial efficiency of 8.85%, which is 21% higher than the conversion efficiency of the a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem solar cells from the current production line.

Abstract: We report the effect of antireflective disordered submicron structures (d-SMSs) on glass substrates for the absorption enhancement of thin-film solar cells. The shape and height of d-SMSs were designed on the basis of the calculation result from the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method. The d-SMSs with tapered shape were fabricated on the back side of SnO2:F covered glass substrate by plasma etching of thermally dewetted silver (Ag) nanoparticles without any lithography processes. The glass substrates with d-SMSs showed very low reflectance compared to that of the glass substrates with flat surface over a wide specular and angular range. Thin-film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells were prepared on the opposite side of d-SMSs integrated glass substrates, and the devices exhibited a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.84% increased value compared to the reference cells with flat surface without detrimental changes in the open circuit voltages (Voc) and fill factor. Also, it is found that the performance of the solar cells is sustained over a wide incident angle of light.

Abstract: The potential of vanadium substituted In2S3 as the active material in intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs) is investigated. The study is performed with a detailed balance model developed by Cuadra et al. that takes into account the shape and overlap of the absorption coefficients. Despite having values of the band gaps that could in principle lead to highly efficient IBSCs, it is found that cells with a practical thickness made of V2In14S24 have a lower efficiency limit than conventional single band gap solar cell materials. It has previously been explained why overlapping absorption coefficients requires the cell thickness to be optimized. In this work it is shown that the thickness dependency of the cell efficiency can have two peaks. In this particular case the two peaks occur at cell thicknesses around 1μm and 1m. The reason for this double peaked dependency is processes where photons are emitted over one band gap and reabsorbed over another. Some of these processes can happen at very low rates and thus not give a significant contribution before a very thick cell is considered. For cells with a reasonable thickness, maximum efficiencies of 20.8% and 26.4% are found for light intensities corresponding to 1 and 1000 suns.

Abstract: The novel diamond-wire sawing technology has been applied in the wafering of Czochralski (CZ) silicon. It is found that phase transformations take place on the wafer surfaces, associated with a smaller roughness. The wafers sliced by the diamond-wire saw have a greater mechanical strength than those by the conventional cutting process, beneficial for the preparation of thin wafers. With the decrease of silicon wafers, both the transmittance and the reflectance of sunlight increase in the long wavelength range. After fabricated into the solar cells by a standard process, their performances have been investigated. The short-circuit current significantly decreases with the wafer thickness, which is attributed to the reduction of effective light absorption. The open-circuit voltage also reduces to some extent since the surface recombination becomes more and more dominant in the minority carrier lifetime. For the ultrathin wafers with a thickness of 60μm, an average conversion efficiency of 16.8% can still be achieved for solar cells based on the standard fabrication process in photovoltaic industry.

Abstract: Electrochromic nickel oxide (Ni(1−x)O) thin films and composite nickel oxide–polyaniline (Ni(1−x)O–PANI) thin films were prepared by a new peroxo soft chemistry route based on a nickel acetate ionic solution precursor. The ionic solution was synthesized from nickel acetate, urea and hydrogen peroxide. The deep green colloidal solution for the preparation of nickel oxide films was prepared by digestion of ionic solution with ethanol. The polyaniline, PANI, was in-situ polymerized from aniline molecular precursor in the second step and then added to the colloidal nickel oxide sol to obtain a deep green–brown colloidal solution appropriate for deposition of composite Ni(1−x)O–PANI films. Thin xerogel films were deposited by a dip-coating technique on FTO glass substrates and heat treated at 300°C. Nano-crystalline non-stoichiometric Ni(1−x)O and composite Ni(1−x)O–PANI films were formed. The as-deposited Ni(1−x)O films exhibited a gray–black color, whereas the composite Ni(1−x)O–PANI films were almost transparent. The electrical, optical and electrochromic properties of all films were examined. The results showed that composite Ni(1−x)O–PANI films exhibit superior properties over plain Ni(1−x)O films. This confirmed the role of PANI, which was selected to improve the electrical and optical properties of nickel oxide films. The electrochromic properties of gray–black Ni(1−x)O and almost transparent composite Ni(1−x)O–PANI films were tested in a 1M LiClO4/propylene carbonate electrolyte. Spectroelectrochemical measurements showed charge capacities above 15mC/cm2 and coloring/bleaching changes from gray–black to transparent of more than 70%. Such changes are sufficient to enable the preparation of efficient electrochromic cells consisting of an anodic nickel oxide based counter electrode and cathodic WO3 electrochromic layer.

Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a vacuum-based, vapor phase technique for the deposition of a donor polymer for use in polymer solar cells. Unsubstituted polythiophene (PT), which is insoluble and infusible and thus typically difficult to process, is easily prepared by oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD). The oCVD process results in a conductive PT film that is heavily doped with FeCl3, which is used as the oxidizing agent. A post-deposition methanol rinse sufficiently dedopes the film and removes spent oxidant, leaving semiconducting PT with an optical bandgap close to 2eV. Drastic changes in the film color, absorption spectra, and film composition confirm the dedoping process. The resulting semiconducting PT is then applied as an electron donor in bilayer heterojunction solar cells with a thermally evaporated C60 electron acceptor layer, resulting in power conversion efficiencies up to 0.8%. The absorption edge of the PT at ∼620nm closely matches the edge present in the external quantum efficiency spectra, indicating that the oCVD PT contributes to the photocurrent of the devices. This demonstrates that the oCVD technique can be used in the processing and design of polymer active layers for polymer solar cells and hybrid small molecular organic solar cells without solubility, temperature, or substrate considerations.

Abstract: Malignant gliomas exhibit abnormal expression of proteolytic enzymes that may participate in the uncontrolled cell proliferation and aberrant interactions with the brain extracellular matrix. The multifunctional membrane bound serine aminopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV has been linked to the development and progression of several malignancies, possibly both through the enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms. In this report we demonstrate the expression of DPP-IV and homologous proteases fibroblast activation protein, DPP8 and DPP9 in primary cell cultures derived from high-grade gliomas, and show that the DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity is negatively associated with their in vitro growth. More importantly, the DPP-IV positive subpopulation isolated from the primary cell cultures using immunomagnetic separation exhibited slower proliferation. Forced expression of the wild as well as the enzymatically inactive mutant DPP-IV in glioma cell lines resulted in their reduced growth, migration and adhesion in vitro, as well as suppressed glioma growth in an orthotopic xenotransplantation mouse model. Microarray analysis of glioma cells with forced DPP-IV expression revealed differential expression of several candidate genes not linked to the tumor suppressive effects of DPP-IV in previous studies. Gene set enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed overrepresentation of gene ontology terms associated with cell proliferation, cell adhesion and migration. In conclusion, our data show that DPP-IV may interfere with several aspects of the malignant phenotype of glioma cells in great part independent of its enzymatic activity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Whether it is possible to reduce the intensity of treatment in early (stage I or II) Hodgkin lymphoma with a favorable prognosis remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted this randomized trial, comparing two treatment groups consisting of a combination chemotherapy regimen of two different intensities followed by involved-field radiation therapy at two different dose levels.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Prospective, randomized, in patients referred to the Department of Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Ninety-eight patients with histologically proven early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma with a favorable prognosis were enrolled in this study between January 2008 and June 2010. They were randomly assigned in one of two treatment arms: arm I received four cycles of ABVD (Adriamycin, belomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) followed by 30Gy of involved-field radiation therapy; arm II received two cycles of ABVD followed by 20Gy of involved-field radiation therapy.
RESULTS
During the follow-up period, the 2-year relapse free survival rates were 96% and 95% in arm I and arm II, respectively(P=.8), while the 2-year overall survival rates were 98% and 95% in arm I and arm II, respectively (P=.16). Acute toxicity affected 54% of patients treated with four cycles of ABVD, who had grade III or IV toxicity, as compared with 30% of those receiving two cycles (P<.02). The rates of acute toxicity (grade III or IV) were also higher among patients treated with 30Gy of involved-field radiation therapy than among those receiving 20Gy (16% vs. 2.5%, P<.03).
CONCLUSION
In patients with early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma and a favorable prognosis, treatment with two cycles of ABVD followed by 20Gy of involved-field radiation therapy was as effective as, and less toxic than, four cycles of ABVD followed by 30Gy of involved-field radiation therapy.

Abstract: This paper describes a Kelvin probe based inspection technique which measures surface potentials (SP) at various illumination conditions and derives the delta surface potential (ΔVSP) and surface band bending (ϕ) of photovoltaic (PV) cells. The ΔVSP is the difference of surface potential measured in light and dark conditions respectively. The delta surface potential (ΔVSP) is related to charge injection and carrier lifetime, while the surface band bending (ϕ) is associated with the surface condition. A white light and short wavelength light illuminations are used to distinguish the bulk effects from that of the surface. A scanning vibrating Kelvin probe system was built to image PV cells with and without illumination. Experiments were performed on both single crystalline silicon (sc-Si) and multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) cells. It is found that the sc-Si cells possess a higher ΔVSP but a lower ϕ than that of mc-Si cells. The average ΔVSP and ϕ are 350mV and 50mV for the sc-Si cells, and 280mV and 110mV for the mc-Si cells. Process defects on a surface could affect both parameters, and it is found that the ΔVSP is not uniform and could be reduced to 170mV at a defect on the mc-Si cells. The high ΔVSP and low ϕs are expected to contribute to the high conversion efficiency on a cell.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the structural, optical and electrical properties of polycrystalline Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin films fabricated by the three-stage co-evaporation process on glass substrate at low substrate temperature (TSub). The structural, optical and electrical properties of the as-grown CIGS films have been investigated by X-ray diffraction spectra, transmittance and reflectance spectra, scanning electron microscope and temperature dependent Hall Effect measurement. The results reveal that the properties of the CIGS film deposited at low temperature strongly depend on the chemical composition. A CIGS solar cell with competitive conversion efficiency of 13.2% without anti-reflection layer using low-temperature process at TSub of 450°C has been demonstrated. Our results suggest that the CIGS absorber for high efficiency solar cells via the low TSub process has a relatively narrow compositional ratio compared to the high TSub process.

Abstract: Abstract
One of the main causes of the degradation of organic solar cells is the interface between the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and the poly (3,4-ethylendioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer (HTL), which is known to be unstable. On the contact surface, corrosion of the ITO is induced by PEDOT:PSS, and this degrades the performance of the device. In this paper, we solve this problem by introducing an inorganic HTL, nickel oxide (NiO), between the ITO and the active layer. Solution process, a low-cost production method for preparing thin films, is employed to fabricate the NiO HTL for organic solar cells based on poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The performance of the resulting organic solar cells is optimized by modifying the baking conditions of the NiO thin films, yielding a power conversion efficiency enhancement of 1.97% and fill factor of 52.11%. Moreover, a remarkable improvement in cell lifetime is observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies show that cell performance and stability strongly depend on the oxygen composition ratio of the NiO structure. The transition of the O2− ratio is a key factor that determines the conductivity of NiO. These results compare favorably with those reported in the literature for conventional devices with PEDOT:PSS.

Abstract: While copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin film solar cells with laboratory efficiencies exceeding 20% have been reported, these high efficiencies may degrade with time as the devices are exposed to humid environments. Specifically, it is well known that water can diffuse to the CIGS–CdS–ZnO heterojunction. This penetration must be reduced or stopped to increase the solar cell lifetime. Herein, we show that tin dioxide layers deposited on top of completed CIGS solar cells can significantly increase the device lifetime by forming a barrier against water diffusion. Specifically, in accelerated damp-heat tests, our best results showed that initially 8–12% efficient CIGS solar cells did not decay from this peak efficiency even after 240h at 85°C and 85% relative humidity. In comparison, under identical test conditions, the solar cells without the tin dioxide layer lost nearly 80% of their initial efficiency, within 24h after commencing the test. We deposited the tin dioxide films by radio frequency magnetron sputtering from tin dioxide targets at 5mTorr. Semicrystalline SnO2 films deposited at room temperature had SnO2 nanocrystals embedded in amorphous SnO2 without grain boundaries. The semicrystalline films exhibited better damp-heat stability than crystalline films deposited at higher temperature. We infer from the slow open circuit voltage decay that water permeation to the p–n junction is reduced when semicrystalline SnO2 overlayers are used to protect the solar cell. We attribute this difference in damp heat stability to the lack of grain boundary water diffusion in semicrystalline SnO2 films.

Abstract: Solar power is an attractive alternative source of electricity. Solar cells, which form the basis of a solar power system, are mainly based on crystalline silicon. Many defects cannot be visually observed with the conventional CCD imaging system. This paper presents defect inspection of multicrystalline solar cells in electroluminescence (EL) images. A solar cell charged with electrical current emits infrared light, whose intensity is lower at intrinsic crystal grain boundaries and extrinsic defects of small cracks, breaks, and finger interruptions. The EL image can distinctly highlight barely visible defects as dark objects, but it also shows random dark regions in the background, which makes automatic inspection in EL images very difficult. A self-reference scheme based on the Fourier image reconstruction technique is proposed for defect detection of solar cells with EL images. The target defects appear as line- or bar-shaped objects in the EL image. The Fourier image reconstruction process is applied to remove the possible defects by setting the frequency components associated with the line- and bar-shaped defects to zero and then back-transforming the spectral image into a spatial image. The defect region can then be easily identified by evaluating the gray-level differences between the original image and its reconstructed image. The reference image is generated from the inspection image itself and, thus, can accommodate random inhomogeneous backgrounds. Experimental results on a set of various solar cells have shown that the proposed method performs effectively for detecting small cracks, breaks, and finger interruptions. The computation time of the proposed method is also fast, making it suitable for practical implementation. It takes only 0.29s to inspect a whole solar cell image with a size of 550×550pixels.

Abstract: This report proposes newly designed all-solution based processes for fabricating hybrid silicon (Si) wire-planar solar cells having conformal zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod anti-reflection coating (ARC). The all-solution processes were composed of three steps. First, metal-assisted chemical etching combined with natural lithography was used to fabricate ordered Si wire arrays. Second, spin-on-dopant (SOD) diffusion was introduced to make a p–n junction in the Si wire arrays and bulk Si substrate. Finally, using hydrothermal synthesis, ZnO nanorods were grown on hybrid Si wire-planar solar cells to create an efficient ARC. Current–voltage (I–V) results show that the hybrid solar cells with ZnO ARC lead to increased power conversion efficiency by more than 25% compared to the planar solar cells. This is mainly attributed to the enhanced light absorption and reduced light reflection by the combination of Si wire geometry and ZnO ARC. This research demonstrates a new approach for lowering the cost of Si wire-based solar cells and making them applicable to photovoltaic devices with large areas.

Abstract: Poor ultraviolet (UV) quantum conversion efficiency contributes to a reduction in the efficiency of silicon based photovoltaic cells. In the UV, the main loss mechanism is through surface recombination of photo-generated carriers due to the shallow absorption depth of high energy photons. One method for greater utilisation of the UV region is by down-shifting UV photons to lower energies where the quantum efficiency of silicon is higher. This work determines the potential enhancement in efficiency that can be obtained by a luminescent down-shifting layer applied to silicon based solar cells. The efficiency is determined through detailed balance arguments. The maximum calculated efficiency enhancement due to an ideal down shifting process is 0.6% absolute using the AM1.5G standard spectra. Applying a similar analysis to a multicrystalline silicon solar cell results in an efficiency enhancement due to the down-shifting process of 0.17% absolute.

Abstract: Herein we report a study of the doping of the poly(2-methoxy-5-(30,70-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4- phenylenevinylene) (MDMO-PPV), poly (3-oc tylthiophene) (P3OT), to the organic photovoltaic devices based on poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and graphene derivative bulk heterojunction structure (BHJ). The addition of the donor polymers to P3HT:Graphene BJT solar cells resulted in a more broad absorption range. The interrelationships between UV–vis absorption, fill factor (FF), energy conversion efficiency (ECE) and current density have been simulated. Dependency of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was based on different doped donors, which is due to the band structure of BHJ where the energy level difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the co-donors and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the solution-processable functionalized graphene oxide (SPFGO) as acceptor was increased. The investigation indicated that the ECE of the co-donors:SPFGO BHJ solar devices with moderate doped donor amount can be influenced by the change of molecular packing structure, which can be interpreted in terms of incorporating doped donor. The XRD investigation of the complex donors/graphene BHJ solar device showed a well-organized intraplane structure with lamellae oriented normal to the substrate. In addition, The SEM investigation indicated the surface roughness morphology of the hybrid active layer film.

Abstract: Ceramides are known to be key players in intracellular signaling and are involved in apoptosis, cell senescence, proliferation, cell growth and differentiation. They are synthesized by ceramide synthases (CerS). So far, six different mammalian CerS (CerS1–6) have been described. Recently, we demonstrated that human breast cancer tissue displays increased activity of CerS2, 4, and 6, together with enhanced generation of their products, ceramides C16:0, C24:0, and C24:1. Moreover, these increases were significantly associated with tumor dignity. To clarify the impact of this observation, we manipulated cellular ceramide levels by overexpressing ceramide synthases 2, 4 or 6 in MCF-7 (breast cancer) and HCT-116 (colon cancer) cells, respectively. Overexpression of ceramide synthases 4 and 6 elevated generation of short chain ceramides C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0, while overexpression of ceramide synthase 2 had no effect on ceramide production in vivo, presumably due to limited substrate availability, because external addition of very long chain acyl-CoAs resulted in a significant upregulation of very long chain ceramides. We also demonstrated that upregulation of CerS4 and 6 led to the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, whereas upregulation of CerS2 increased cell proliferation. On the basis of our data, we propose that a disequilibrium between ceramides of various chain length is crucial for cancer progression, while normal cells require an equilibrium between very long and long chain ceramides for normal physiology.

Abstract: Alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) is a pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. Its deficiency causes the hereditary kidney stone disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1. AGT is a highly stable compact dimer and the first 21 residues of each subunit form an extension which wraps over the surface of the neighboring subunit. Naturally occurring and artificial amino acid replacements in this extension create changes in the functional properties of AGT in mammalian cells, including relocation of the enzyme from peroxisomes to mitochondria. In order to elucidate the structural and functional role of this N-terminal extension, we have analyzed the consequences of its removal using a variety of biochemical and cell biological methods. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the N-terminal deleted form of AGT showed the presence of the protein but in an insoluble form resulting in only a 10% soluble yield as compared to the full-length version. The purified soluble fraction showed reduced affinity for PLP and greatly reduced catalytic activity. Although maintaining a dimer form, it was highly prone to self-aggregation. When expressed in a mammalian cell line, the truncated construct was normally targeted to peroxisomes, where it formed large stable but catalytically inactive aggregates. These results suggest that the N-terminal extension plays an essential role in allowing AGT to attain its correct conformation and functional activity. The precise mechanism of this effect is still under investigation.

Abstract: Composite material solar cells have been proposed and even recently processed with dye sensitizers embedded in a microcrystalline silicon thin film matrix to enhance absorption. In this contribution we present calculations to estimate the efficiency improvement of such hybrid dye-microcrystalline silicon solar cells compared to pure single junction pin microcrystalline solar cells. The simulation results for varying thicknesses of the dye-incorporated microcrystalline silicon layer demonstrate a potential efficiency improvement of almost 30% compared with a pure microcrystalline silicon cell. For the same efficiency, the thickness of the hybrid system can potentially be reduced to almost one-third of the pure microcrystalline layer. We discuss how these achievements depend on the photon energies of maximum absorption of the dye.

Angiotensin II-induced pro-fibrotic effects require p38MAPK activity and transforming growth factor beta 1 expression in skeletal muscle cells,

Abstract: Fibrotic disorders are typically characterised by excessive connective tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition that preclude the normal healing of different tissues. Several skeletal muscle dystrophies are characterised by extensive fibrosis. Among the factors involved in skeletal muscle fibrosis is angiotensin II (Ang-II), a key protein of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). We previously demonstrated that myoblasts responded to Ang-II by increasing the ECM protein levels mediated by AT-1 receptors, implicating an Ang-II-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism. In this paper, we show that in myoblasts, Ang-II induced the increase of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression through its AT-1 receptor. This effect is dependent of the NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX)-induced ROS, as indicated by a decrease of the expression of both pro-fibrotic factors when the ROS production was inhibited via the NOX inhibitor apocynin. The increase in pro-fibrotic factors levels was paralleled by enhanced p38MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to Ang-II. However, only the p38MAPK activity was critical for the Ang-II-induced fibrotic effects, as indicated by the decrease in the Ang-II-induced TGF-β1 and CTGF expression and fibronectin levels by SB-203580, an inhibitor of the p38MAPK, but not by U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we showed that the Ang-II-dependent p38MAPK activation, but not the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, was necessary for the NOX-derived ROS. In addition, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 expression was required for the Ang-II-induced pro-fibrotic effects evaluated by using SB-431542, an inhibitor of TGF-βRI kinase activity, and by knocking down TGF-β1 levels by shRNA technique. These results strongly suggest that the fibrotic response to Ang-II is mediated by the AT-1 receptor and requires the p38MAPK phosphorylation, NOX-induced ROS, and TGF-β1 expression increase mediated by Ang-II in skeletal muscle cells.

Abstract: Although bone pain in osteoporosis and skeletal metastasis is an expected consequence of fracture, there are other underlying causes responsible. Our study demonstrated that ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1 detected extracellular protons in MG63 cells, and regulated osteoblast functions, such as prostaglandin E2 production, in response to acidic circumstances. In this work, we measured inositol phosphate production, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, prostaglandin E2 production, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation in MG63 cells exposed to extracellular acidification. Extracellular acidity induced a transient increase in Ca2+ concentration and inositol phosphate production. Acidification also induced prostaglandin E2 production, resulting in cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation. A small interfering RNA specific for the ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1 markedly inhibited these proton-induced actions in MG63 cells. These results indicated that the involvement of ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1 in acidic extracellular environment may be an underlying mechanism responsible for bone pain in osteoporosis or bone metastasis without clinically proved fractures.

Abstract: Typically, most low bandgap materials have low absorption with wavelength at around 500nm. Besides, the restrictions of active layer thickness of thin film polymer solar cells (PSCs) make the devices reduce to absorb light in long wavelength region (around 700nm). As absorption would be a joint effect of material band properties and optical structures, well-designed light-trapping strategies for these low-bandgap PSCs will be more useful to further enhance efficiencies. We investigate the change of optical properties and device performances of organic solar cells based on our newly synthesized low-bandgap material with embedded poly-(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS grating in the photoactive bulk heterojunction layer. Our results show that the PEDOT:PSS grating with a period of 320nm and depth of 40nm makes the light absorption improved in specific regions of the solar spectrum, especially the weak absorption region of our bulk heterojunction material near 500nm and the red/near-infrared region at around 700nm. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) also improves with corresponding enhancement peaks. The physical understanding of the absorption enhancement will be investigated and described through our theoretical study. The power conversion efficiency is improved due to the enhancement of short circuit current. The work demonstrates the absorption enhancement of low bandgap solar cells using appropriate grating structures and provides the physical understanding of the absorption enhancement for improving the performances of organic solar cells.

Abstract: Accumulation of collagen I and III in the myocardium is a prominent feature of interstitial fibrosis. Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) facilitates fibrosis by increasing collagen synthesis. However, the underlying mechanisms mediating the effect of PGF2α on collagen expression in cardiac fibroblasts are not yet fully elucidated. We measured the mRNA and protein levels of collagen I and III by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Activation of signaling pathways was determined by western blot analysis. In primary rat cardiac fibroblasts, treatment with PGF2α stimulated both the mRNA and protein levels of collagen I and III, and pretreatment with the F-prostanoid (FP) receptor antagonist AL-8810, protein kinase C inhibitor LY-333531, and Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 significantly inhibited PGF2α-induced collagen I and III expression. FP receptor, protein kinase C, and Rho kinase were activated with PGF2α treatment. PGF2α may be an important regulator in the synthesis of collagen I and III via an FP receptor/protein kinase C/Rho kinase cascade in cardiac fibroblasts, which might be a new therapeutic target for myocardial fibrosis.

Abstract: It is known that polyamines increase cell growth through stimulation of the synthesis of several kinds of proteins encoded by the so-called “polyamine modulon”. We recently reported that polyamines also increase cell viability at the stationary phase of cell growth through stimulation of the synthesis of ribosome modulation factor, a component of the polyamine modulon. Accordingly, we looked for other proteins involved in cell viability whose synthesis is stimulated by polyamines. It was found that the synthesis of ppGpp regulatory protein (SpoT) and ω protein of RNA polymerase (RpoZ) was stimulated by polyamines at the level of translation. Stimulation of the synthesis of SpoT and RpoZ by polyamines was due to an inefficient initiation codon UUG in spoT mRNA and an unusual location of a Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence in rpoZ mRNA. Accordingly, the spoT and rpoZ genes are components of the polyamine modulon involved in cell viability. Reduced cell viability caused by polyamine deficiency was prevented by modified spoT and rpoZ genes whose synthesis was not influenced by polyamines. Under these conditions, the level of ppGpp increased in parallel with increase of SpoT protein. The results indicate that polyamine stimulation of synthesis of SpoT and RpoZ plays important roles for cell viability through stimulation of ppGpp synthesis by SpoT and modulation of RNA synthesis by ppGpp–RpoZ complex.

Abstract: Fusion of mononucleated myoblasts to generate multinucleated myotubes is a critical step in skeletal muscle development. Filopodia, the actin cytoskeleton based membrane protrusions, have been observed early during myoblast fusion, indicating that they could play a direct role in myogenic differentiation. The control of filopodia formation in myoblasts remains poorly understood. Here we show that the expression of IRSp53 (Insulin Receptor Substrate protein 53kDa), a known regulator of filopodia formation, is down-regulated during differentiation of both mouse primary myoblasts and a mouse myoblast cell line C2C12. Over-expression of IRSp53 in C2C12 cells led to induction of filopodia and decrease in cell adhesion, concomitantly with inhibition of myogenic differentiation. In contrast, knocking down the IRSp53 expression in C2C12 cells led to a small but significant increase in myotube development. The decreased cell adhesion of C2C12 cells over-expressing IRSp53 is correlated with a reduction in the number of vinculin patches in these cells. Mutations in the conserved IMD domain (IRSp53 and MIM (missing in metastasis) homology domain) or SH3 domain of IRSp53 abolished the ability of this protein to inhibit myogenic differentiation and reduce cell adhesion. Over-expression of the IMD domain alone was sufficient to decrease the cell–extracellular matrix adhesion and to inhibit myogenesis in a manner dependent on its function in membrane shaping. Based on our data, we propose that IRSp53 is a negative regulator of myogenic differentiation which correlates with the observed down regulation of IRSp53 expression during myoblast differentiation to myotubes.

Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to overcoming the limitations of low long-wavelength absorption and short charge transport lengths in electrodeposited bilayer ZnO/Cu2O solar cells. Here we reduce the Cu2O thickness to approximately the minority carrier transport length and coat a film of a semiconducting polymer between the Cu2O and a top electrode. We demonstrate efficient hole-injection from Cu2O into the semiconducting polymer as well as blocking of electrons by the polymer. We also show optical confinement of long-wavelength light inside of the collection area in the Cu2O resulting from refractive index mismatch between the polymer and Cu2O. This leads to improved extraction of charge carriers and higher Jsc values from much thinner Cu2O layers than are normally used.

Abstract: In this paper we report about some aspects and the progress reached in the reel-to-reel (R2R) solvent-based production of polymer solar cells. In awareness of the huge advantages in energy and material savings the hole-injection and the photoactive layer were successfully prepared by continuous slot-die wet coating of low viscosity inks. The objective was to obtain higher values of light power conversion efficiencies for reducing the gap between production under optimal laboratory conditions via spin-coating on rigid substrates in comparison to the more robust and practically significant large-scale coating of flexible substrates. For this purpose, solvent systems were varied and a new fullerene used as electron–acceptor, leading to the highest light power conversion efficiencies (η=4.55%) described for polymer solar cells (PSCs) on flexible substrates up to now. PSCs manufactured from continuously coated foils by using a small-scale laboratory R2R-coating machine yield a maximum value of η=3.2%. With respect to environmental, safety and technological demands, reel-to-reel wet coating with a change to non-halogenated inks was also successfully carried out in order to learn more about its technological suitability and to allow the transfer of the results afterwards to other, more efficient material systems.

Abstract: An insulation partition was designed in a seeded directional solidification (DS) furnace of industrial-size to produce quasi-single crystalline silicon ingot for solar cells of high efficiency. We used a transient global model to study the effects of the insulation partition block on the temperature and thermal stress fields in the solidified silicon ingot during the solidification process. We validated the transient global model by comparing the calculations with the experimental measurements. Simulation results show that an insulation partition block can significantly reduce the total heating power consumption and influence the temperature and velocity fields in the silicon melt. We also found that the melt-crystal interface (m–c interface) shape changes from concave to convex to the melt with a larger crystal growth rate with an insulation partition, while it always remains flat with a smaller crystal growth rate without a partition block. The axial temperature gradient and thermal stress in the grown silicon crystal increased with a partition block. The solar cells from the grown quasi-single crystalline silicon ingot exhibited higher short-circuit current (Isc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). The average conversion efficiency of solar cells is increased to 17.8% and about 1.2% more than that based on mc-Si ingot from the conventional furnace.

Abstract: The blend ratio effect on the photovoltaic performance of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT):PCBM and poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) solar cells was systematically investigated. In addition to electrical characteristics, the morphology of the blends was examined using Atomic force microscopy (AFM) since the performance of the organic solar cells depends on the morphological organization of donor and acceptor compounds within the bulk heterojunction active layer. The results revealed that decreasing PCBM content, the photovoltaic performances of both organic solar cells improved. The optical microscope images of P3OT:PCBM blend showed that the morphology resembles a needle structure. Both the sizes and the amount of needles decreased with decreasing PCBM loading. An important part of understanding degradation mechanism is proper evaluation of organic solar cell performance as a function of time. In this study, ISOS-D-3 Damp testing was carried for all devices. ISOS-L-1 testing indicated that the efficiencies and short circuit currents of all devices have small variations except for P3OT:PCBM (1:0.6) ratios.

Abstract: Low cost reflectors were applied to dye-sensitized solar cell modules to reduce the energy losses caused by the inactive areas occupied by sealing materials and metal fingers, and significant improvement of overall efficiency was achieved. An improved model was used to simulate the modules, and the optimized geometry parameters of the modules were obtained. After applying the reflectors, wider silver fingers, and smaller cells were recommended for large area modules, and the influence of the width of sealing material was reduced. Simulation results show that the maximum total area efficiency of 11.22% for large area modules could be achieved based on the small cell with efficiency of 11.4% and reflectors with reflectivity of 0.9. The reflectors can be utilized in any kind of solar cell with inactive areas. The model can also be applied to other kinds of solar cell module with any geometry characters, and the optimized parameters can be obtained easily for any design.

Abstract: This paper reports polymer solar cells (PSCs) using chlorinated indium tin oxide (Cl-ITO) substrates with high work function as the anode. There is no conducting polymer buffer layer between the Cl-ITO anode and the active layer in these PSCs. PSCs with P3HT:PCBM (P3HT=poly(3-hexylthiophene), PCBM=[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) exhibited high photovoltaic performance, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.91mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.57, fill factor (FF) of 0.69, and photovoltaic efficiency of 3.90% under AM1.5G illumination immediately after the device fabrication. The photovoltaic performance is comparable to that of normal PSCs with a conducting polymer buffer layer. But the photovoltaic efficiency of PSCs with Cl-ITO degrades quickly. The photovoltaic efficiency dropped to 3.43% and 3.24% just 10 and 20min after the device fabrication, respectively. The reasons for the photovoltaic degradation were studied by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The work function of Cl-ITO decreases with time. The decrease in the work function of Cl-ITO is attributed to Cl desorption from the surface of ITO.

Abstract: We investigated the mechanical integrity and flexibility of the transparent Ag nanowire (NW) network electrode coated on colorless polyimide (CPI) substrates using a lab-made bending test apparatus involving detailed outer/inner bending, twisting, and stretching for flexible organic solar cells. At the optimized conditions with a coverage rate of 42.25%, the Ag NW network electrode showed a sheet resistance of 21.76Ω/□ and an optical transmittance of 84.84%, which are better than the values obtained from a conventional flexible amorphous ITO film. Notably, the Ag NW electrode had a constant resistance change (ΔR/R0) within an outer and inner bending radius of 5mm each. The twisting test also revealed that the resistance of the Ag NW network electrode remained constant below a twisting angle of 35° due to the superior flexibility of the Ag NW network. Furthermore, the stretched Ag NW electrode showed a fairly constant resistance change (ΔR/R0) up to 4%, which is more stable than the resistance change of a flexible ITO electrode. Flexible organic solar cells were fabricated on flexible Ag NW network electrodes and peeled off the supporting glass substrates. The power conversion efficiency of the flexible solar cells was measured to be 2.62%, demonstrating the possibility of Ag NW networks as flexible transparent conducting electrodes for flexible organic solar cells.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes, providing a potential source for musculoskeletal tissue engineering. Retinoid signaling plays very important roles in skeletal development. CRBP1 (cellular retinol binding protein 1), a key component of retinoid signaling pathway, is known to take part in vitamin A metabolism and intracellular transporting of retinoids. However, the role of CRBP1 in MSCs remains still obscure. In this study, we investigated the cellular effects of CRBP1 on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that CRBP1 overexpression promoted osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived MSCs, while inhibited their adipogenic differentiation. We also demonstrated that the possible underlying mechanism for CRBP1 promoting osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was by inhibiting RXRα-induced β-catenin degradation, maintaining β-catenin and pERK1/2 at higher levels. These findings reveal a potential role of CRBP1 in the regulation of β-catenin turnover which can greatly affect the process of osteogenesis and adipogenesis of MSCs.

Abstract: A method for the analysis of large-area solar cells was established using an equivalent circuit model. A polygonal line approximation simplifies the model and the characteristics for large-area solar cells were formulated. The method determines the length limit of solar cells, which is dependent mainly on the sheet resistance of the transparent electrode and the open circuit voltage and slightly on the parasitic resistances such as series resistance and shunt resistance. Here we established a simple and quantitative design principle for large-area solar cells based on the model. This model can be applied to both organic and inorganic solar cells but is particularly useful for organic solar cells, whose characteristics are influenced by parasitic resistances.

SOX9 regulates endocrine cell differentiation during human fetal pancreas development,

Abstract: The transition of pancreatic progenitor cells to mature endocrine cells is regulated by the sequential activation and interaction of several transcription factors. In mice, the transcription factor Sox9 has been shown to support endocrine cell differentiation. However, the functional role of SOX9 during pancreas development in the human has yet to be determined. The present study was to characterize SOX9 expression during human fetal pancreas development and examine its functional role by transfection with SOX9 siRNA or SOX9 expression vectors. Here we report that SOX9 was most frequently expressed in PDX1+ cells (60–83%) and least in mature endocrine cells (<1–14%). The proliferation of SOX9+ cells was significantly higher at 8-10weeks than at 14–21weeks (p<0.05) or 20–21weeks (p<0.01). SOX9 frequently co-localized with FOXA2, NGN3 and transcription factors linked to NGN3 (NKX2.2, NKX6.1, PAX6). siRNA knockdown of SOX9 significantly decreased islet-epithelial cell proliferation, NGN3, NKX6.1, PAX6 and INS mRNA levels and the number of NGN3+ and insulin+ cells (p<0.05) while increasing GCG mRNA and glucagon+ cells (p<0.05). Examination of SOX9 associated signaling pathways revealed a decrease in phospho-Akt (p<0.01), phospho-GSK3β (p<0.01) and cyclin D1 (p<0.01) with a decrease in nuclear β-catenin+ (p<0.05) cells following SOX9 siRNA knockdown. In contrast, over-expression of SOX9 significantly increased the number of islet cells proliferating, NGN3, NKX6.1, PAX6 and INS mRNA levels, the phospho-Akt/GSK3β cascade and the number of insulin+ cells. Our results demonstrated that SOX9 is important for the expression of NGN3 and molecular markers of endocrine cell differentiation in the human fetal pancreas.

Abstract: The fracture resistance of P3HT:PC60BM-based photovoltaic devices are characterized using quantitative adhesion and cohesion metrologies that allow identification of the weakest layer or interface in the device structure. We demonstrate that the phase separated bulk heterojunction layer is the weakest layer and report quantitative cohesion values which ranged from ∼1 to 20Jm−2. The effects of layer thickness, composition, and annealing treatments on layer cohesion are investigated. Using depth profiling and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the resulting fracture surfaces, we examine the gradient of molecular components through the thickness of the bulk heterojunction layer. Finally, using atomic force microscopy we show how the topography of the failure path is related to buckling of the metal electrode and how it develops with annealing. The research provides new insights on how the molecular design, structure and composition affect the cohesive properties of organic photovoltaics.

Abstract: The observation that high cellular concentrations of NADH were associated with low adenylate cyclase activity led to a search for the mechanism of the effect. Since cyclase is in the plasma membrane, we considered the membrane might have a site for NADH action, and that NADH might be oxidized at that site. A test for NADH oxidase showed very low activity, which could be increased by adding growth factors. The plasma membrane oxidase was not inhibited by inhibitors of mitochondrial NADH oxidase such as cyanide, rotenone or antimycin. Stimulation of the plasma membrane oxidase by iso-proterenol or triiodothyronine was different from lack of stimulation in endoplasmic reticulum. After 25 years of research, three components of a trans membrane NADH oxidase have been discovered. Flavoprotein NADH coenzyme Q reductases (NADH cytochrome b reductase) on the inside, coenzyme Q in the middle, and a coenzyme Q oxidase on the outside as a terminal oxidase. The external oxidase segment is a copper protein with unique properties in timekeeping, protein disulfide isomerase and endogenous NADH oxidase activity, which affords a mechanism for control of cell growth by the overall NADH oxidase and the remarkable inhibition of oxidase activity and growth of cancer cells by a wide range of anti-tumor drugs. A second trans plasma membrane electron transport system has been found in voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), which has NADH ferricyanide reductase activity. This activity must be considered in relation to ferricyanide stimulation of growth and increased VDAC antibodies in patients with autism.

Abstract: High performance bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells with blade-coated active layers of POD2T-DTBT blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are demonstrated in this work. The blade-coated cells exhibit power conversion efficiencies of up to 6.74%, which is comparable to those of conventional spincoated cells but obtained with just a fraction of the material amount used for spincoating. The choice of solvent and the process conditions are manipulated to achieve dense, well-separated morphology which increases the interfacial area for charge dissociation in the blend film. The blade coating technique can be applied in the fabrication of large area, high performance OPV cells with highly efficient materials usage.

Abstract: This paper describes the effect of tensile strains of up to 20% on the photovoltaic properties of organic solar cells based on two different conjugated polymers and their blends with (6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The two conjugated polymers are poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a donor–acceptor polymer whose repeat unit comprises a diketo pyrrolo-pyrrole moiety, thiophene, thienothiophene, and thiophene (DPPT-TT). The stretchable substrate, transparent electrode, and top electrode are, respectively, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and eutectic gallium–indium (EGaIn). Analysis of the results of mechanical testing using a buckling based metrology, atomic force and optical microscopy, and linear and cyclic applications of strain yielded six major conclusions. (i) The identity of the conjugated polymer significantly affects the response of the solar cells to strain. Blending of PCBM in bulk heterojunction films stiffens P3HT more than it stiffens DPPT-TT, as determined by buckling-based measurements of elastic moduli. (ii) The greater elastic modulus of P3HT:PCBM than that of DPPT-TT:PCBM is correlated with a greater tendency of P3HT:PCBM to fracture under strain. (iii) PEDOT:PSS has the effect of an adhesion layer of the bulk heterojunction films to PDMS; its presence increases the crack-onset strain from <2% to 8% for P3HT:PCBM and from 6% to 12% for DPPT-TT:PCBM. (iv) Cracks dominate the characteristics of the devices under strain. The differences in the response to strain between devices comprising P3HT:PCBM and DPPT-TT:PCBM are correlated to the unequal brittleness of the polymer:fullerene films. (v) Devices based on both P3HT and DPPT-TT exhibit increased open-circuit voltage with strain, which is greatest for devices containing P3HT. These effects are attributed to disruption of the gallium oxide “skin” that covers the top electrode, EGaIn. (vi) Wave-like buckles appear in the films upon stretching ≤10% for the first time. These buckles permit reversible stretchability.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semiconductor-sensitized solar cell with the photoanode based on poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)@CdS@TiO2 nanotube array was fabricated. Vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays were prepared by a sol–gel based method using ZnO nanorod arrays as sacrificing template. CdS nanocrystals and a thin P3HT layer were electrodeposited onto the wall of TiO2 nanotube to prepare the photoanode of the semiconductor-sensitized solar cell. It has been demonstrated that the coating of P3HT on the surface of the CdS@TiO2 core-shell nanotube arrays could largely improve the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell. A power conversion efficiency of 1.16% was obtained with this type of solar cell.

Abstract: Laser micro-welding is a technique that can be used for interconnective (P2) patterning of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells after deposition of the ZnO:Al window layer. The micro-welding process transforms CIGS into a conductive compound that forms a contact between the ZnO:Al front contact and the Mo back contact. In this work we present a study on the influence of process parameters on the interconnectivity of the laser micro-weld as well as an investigation of the morphology of the micro-weld zone. We found that the current method results in an overlap of conditions where electrical connection is achieved and where Mo/glass damage is caused by laser action. Stability testing shows that interconnections processed without appreciable damage are stable. The connecting region contained metal rich zones and segregated CuxSe that we believe account for its conductivity.

Abstract: Electrically colourable (“electrochromic”) windows, hitherto confined to small areas, have recently been much expanded in area in new aircraft windows. Reviews indicate that to extend such high-tech applications to more everyday uses requires enhanced robustness, as in a new Prussian-Blue/polymer(Li+)/WO3 electrochromic device reported here. The new polymer electrolyte is UV-curable within the cell, obviating the need and risk of thermal polymerization while conferring mechanical robustness. Prussian Blue, (in reduced form the clear Prussian white “PW”, that is turned blue on electro-oxidation) and WO3 (showing a complementary clear-to-blue on electron uptake) are known to reliably undergo these established colourations as electrochromic anode and cathode, respectively.

Abstract: Gallium-doped silver–indium–sulfide (Ga-doped AgInS2) samples were deposited onto fluorine-doped-tin-oxide (FTO) glass substrates using a one-step electrodeposition method. The effect of the [Ga]/[In] molar ratio in the solution bath on the structure, morphology, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of samples is reported. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples reveal that the peaks of samples shifted to higher angles with increasing [Ga]/[In] ratio in the solution bath. The thickness, direct band gap, and indirect band gap of the samples were in the ranges of 643–580nm, 1.84eV–1.93eV, and 1.42–1.59eV, respectively. The flat-band potentials of the films were in the range from –0.76 to –0.99V vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), as obtained using Mott–Schottky plots and open-circuit potential (OCP) measurements of samples. The maximum photoenhancement current density (10.37±0.13mAcm−2) was obtained for Ga-doped AgInS2 films with a precursor ratio of [Ga]/[In]=0.03 at an applied bias of +1.0V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode in K2SO3 (0.25M) and Na2S (0.35M) aqueous solution. Results show that high-quality Ga-doped AgInS2 thin films can be deposited on FTO glass using one-step electrodeposition for PEC applications. Stability test of the AgInS2 thin films in aqueous solution is also reported in this study.

Abstract: Cracking is a common problem encountered during the fabrication of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells. In this study, electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) is developed as a tool for rapid identification of cracks in PV cells. Thermally induced cell deformation of defect-free and defect-bearing PV cells was first modeled with numerical simulations and then experimentally studied by optical configuration for ESPI measurement of out-of-plane deformations. Both numerical and experimental results indicate that the speckle patterns imparted during thermal deformation of a cell allow for simultaneous quantification of crack size, location and type in both single- and poly-crystalline PV cells. Speckle patterns near defects were manifested as continuous, chevron-shaped, and broken fringes for scratch, surface cracks, and through cracks, respectively. For comparison to other existing techniques, full field electroluminescent images were also provided for every defective PV cell. Electroluminescent imaging is capable of detecting cracks, but unlike ESPI, is unable to distinguish between the different types of cracks. Because the amount of heating needed to induce out-of-plane deformation resolvable by ESPI is small (<0.5°C) and because ESPI is sensitive to crack type, the ESPI-based imaging study presented here can potentially be developed into a rapid, non-destructive inspection tool for the structural integrity of solar cells at any point within the manufacturing process.

Abstract: Innovative Phase Change Material (PCM)/carbon-based composite materials were developed. These materials show higher thermal conductivity than that of pure PCM. An increase of up to 576% in thermal conductivity was obtained. They consist of PCM embedded in a carbon-containing host matrix (expanded graphite or multiwall carbon nanotubes). Previously, different expansion methods were carried out on several types of graphite. A thorough characterization of the graphite was made using Isotherms BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) method (N2 adsorption), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) which allowed to understand the changes of the microstructure at the different expansion method stages and to select the most efficient expansion method with the most promising graphite. The surface area of the expanded graphite was increased up to 1267%. PCMs inside carbon-based matrices were integrated using an autoclave reactor in a novel way. The composites were thermally characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal conductivity (TC) and thermal validation tests. These new materials are focused on electronic applications and plastic injection moulds, where high thermal conductivity is required. The objectives are to avoid peak temperature and reduce thermal oscillations, respectively.

Abstract: Two of the methods of exceeding the detailed balance limit for a single junction solar cell are down-converting high energy photons to produce two photons and carrier multiplication, whereby high energy photons produce more than one electron–hole pair. Both methods obey the conservation of energy in similar ways, and effectively produce a higher current in the solar cell. Due to this similarity, it has been assumed in the literature that there is no thermodynamic difference between the two methods. Here, we analyzed the two methods using a generalized approach based on Kirchhoff's law of radiation and develop a new model for carrier multiplication. We demonstrate that there is an entropic penalty to be paid for attempting to accomplish all-in-one splitting in carrier multiplication systems, giving a small thermodynamic – and therefore efficiency – advantage to spectral splitting prior to reaching the solar cell. We show this analytically using a derivation of basic thermodynamic identities; numerically by solving for the maximal efficiency; and generally using heat-generation arguments. Our result provides a new limit of entropy generation in solar cells beyond the existing literature, and a new distinction among 3rd generation photovoltaic technologies.

Abstract: Recently, Applied Materials has demonstrated the ability to manufacture large area a-Si/μc-Si thin film modules with total area efficiencies of 10% and above. Reducing the production costs is now the key objective for an economic success of this technology. Decreasing the absorber layer thickness or increasing the deposition rate can reduce the cost significantly because the PECVD deposition of the silicon layers is one of the main cost contributors. But this would also reduce the conversion efficiency of amorphous/microcrystalline tandem cells (a-Si/μc-Si TJ cells). Therefore, optimizing TJ cells for maximal productivity requires a careful balancing of layer thicknesses and deposition rates. In this paper we studied the impact of deposition rates and absorber layer thicknesses for top and bottom cells. The reduction of the bottom cell (BC) thickness from 2μm to less than 1μm showed only a small impact on the stabilized module efficiency while having a big impact on the productivity of a production line. The influence of the top cell (TC) deposition rate on the other hand results in a big decrease of the efficiency while having only a small impact on the line output. 10.2% stable mini-module efficiency could be achieved with 900nm BC thickness, reducing the deposition time by 50%.

Abstract: Citrate carrier (CiC), a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, is an essential component of the shuttle system which transports acetyl-CoA from mitochondria to the cytosol where lipogenesis occurs. CiC is regulated by SREBP-1, a transcription factor that controls the expression of several lipogenic genes. CiC is also implicated in cholesterol synthesis, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, suggesting that besides SREBP-1 other transcription factors could modulate the expression of its gene. Here, we provide evidences demonstrating that CiC expression is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and gamma in hepatocytes and adipocytes, respectively. CiC expression increased in rat BRL-3A hepatocytes treated with WY-14,643, agonist of PPARα, and in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with rosiglitazone, agonist of PPARγ. The overexpression of PPARα/RXRα and PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer enhanced CiC promoter activity in BRL-3A and 3T3-L1, respectively. Luciferase reporter gene and gel mobility shift assays indicated that a functional peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE), identified in the CiC promoter, conferred responsiveness to activation by PPARs. The binding of PPRE of CiC promoter by PPARα and PPARγ in vivo was confirmed by ChIP assay in BRL-3A and 3T3-L1 cells, respectively.

Abstract: Myelosuppression and drug resistance are common adverse effects in cancer patients with chemotherapy, and those severely limit the therapeutic efficacy and lead treatment failure. It is unclear by which cellular mechanism anticancer drugs suppress bone marrow, while drug-resistant tumors survive. We report that due to the difference of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), catalyzing ceramide glycosylation, doxorubicin (Dox) eliminates bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and expands breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). It was found that Dox decreased the numbers of BMSCs (ABCG2+) and the sphere formation in a dose-dependent fashion in isolated bone marrow cells. In tumor-bearing mice, Dox treatments (5mg/kg, 6 days) decreased the numbers of BMSCs and white blood cells; conversely, those treatments increased the numbers of BCSCs (CD24−/CD44+/ESA+) more than threefold in the same mice. Furthermore, therapeutic-dose of Dox (1mg/kg/week, 42 days) decreased the numbers of BMSCs while it increased BCSCs in vivo. Breast cancer cells, rather than bone marrow cells, highly expressed GCS, which was induced by Dox and correlated with BCSC pluripotency. These results indicate that Dox may have opposite effects, suppressing BMSCs versus expanding BCSCs, and GCS is one determinant of the differentiated responsiveness of bone marrow and cancer cells.

Abstract: Characterizing the performance of terrestrial multi-junction solar cells under a broad range of sunlight concentration and operating temperatures is important for designing high concentration photovoltaic systems. Experimental data is available for these cells but a satisfactory cell model, calibrated over the full range of these operating conditions, was not yet presented. This study presents single-diode and two-diode equivalent circuit semi-empirical models for InGaP/InGaAs/Ge triple-junction cells, calibrated against available empirical data published by two cell manufacturers. The two-diode model offers a better fit to the experimental values compared to the single diode model. In particular, the two diodes model describes better the dependence of efficiency on concentration. However, some systematic deviations still exist in both models, mainly related to temperature dependence. Based on these results, two further modeling issues are identified as promising directions for further improvement of the models.

UV–vis and electrochemical studies indicated that polymers have desirable HOMO–LUMO and band gap energy levels, enabling efficient electron transfer when blending them with fullerene derivatives. Photovoltaic properties of the copolymers mixed with [6,6] phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), were investigated. P2 exhibited the best device performance with an open circuit voltage of 0.6V, short circuit current of 3.4mA/cm2 and power conversion efficiency of 0.56% under Air mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G, 100mW/cm2) illumination. Hole mobilities of the polymers were calculated using space charge limited current (SCLC) method and found to be in the order of 10−5 for P1 and P2 and 10−4 for P3.

Abstract: Among the different species of water-soluble β-peptides (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40 and N-terminal truncated Aβ-peptides), Aβpy3-42 is thought to play a relevant role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis due to its abundance, resistance to proteolysis, fast aggregation kinetics, dynamic structure and high neurotoxicity. To evaluate the specific structural characteristics and neurotoxicity of Aβpy3-42, we separated different aggregation states of Aβ1-42 and Aβpy3-42 using fast protein liquid chromatography, isolating in both cases three peaks that corresponded to sa (small), ma (medium) and la (large) aggregates. Conformational analysis, by circular dichroism showed a prevailing random coil conformation for sa and ma, and typical β-sheet conformation for la. AFM and TEM show differential structural features between the three aggregates of a given β-peptide and among the aggregate of the two β-peptides. The potential toxic effects of the different aggregates were evaluated using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells in the MTT reduction, in the xCELLigence System, and in the Annexin V binding experiments. In the case of Aβ1-42 the most toxic aggregate is la, while in the case of Aβpy3-42 both sa and la are equally toxic. Aβ aggregates were found to be internalized in the cells, as estimated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, with a higher effect observed for Aβpy3-42, showing a good correlation with the toxic effects. Together these experiments allowed the discrimination of the intermediate states more responsible of oligomer toxicity, providing new insights on the correlation between the aggregation process and the toxicity and confirming the peculiar role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease of Aβpy3-42 peptide.

Abstract: Crystal structures of three long-chain n-alkylammonium dihydrogen phosphates n-CnH2n+1NH3·H2PO4(s) (n=8, 9 and 10) (abbreviated as C8P, C9P and C10P), which may be used as the phase change materials in storage and utilization of solar energy, were determined in layered structures by X-ray crystallography, and the same hydrogen bonding network is observed for these long carbon chain compounds. Low-temperature heat capacities of the compounds were measured by a precision adiabatic calorimeter over the temperature range from 78 to 380K. Two solid–solid phase transitions were observed for C8P and C9P, but only one solid–solid phase transition was observed for C10P. The temperatures, molar enthalpies and entropies of the phase transitions were determined based on the analysis of heat capacity curves. Experimental heat capacities for each compound were fitted to two polynomial equations. The smoothed heat capacities and thermodynamic functions (HTο−H298.15ο) and (STο−S298.15ο) of the three compounds were calculated with an interval of 10K in terms of the polynomial equations.

Abstract: We have demonstrated the seed-assisted cast quasi-single crystalline (QSC) silicon technique to achieve high efficiency solar cells with low cost. Compared to multicrystalline (mc) silicon, the QSC silicon has better material properties, having higher minority carrier lifetime and fewer grain boundaries and dislocations. Furthermore, the 〈100〉 oriented QSC silicon can achieve a lower surface reflectance using alkaline texturing. Based on these two factors, the efficiency of the QSC silicon solar cells with the industrial size has been improved by up to 1% absolutely from the mc-Si counterparts. Compared to the Czochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells, the QSC cells have slightly lower efficiency but high productivity and negligible light-induced degradation. These results suggest a great potential of the QSC silicon applied in photovoltaic industry as the next generation substrate. To make the QSC silicon more competitive in industry, further efforts should be focused on the recycling of seed crystals, the coverage of mono-region and the control of structural defects.

Abstract: We report a detailed study on the operating principles of silver nanowire (Ag NW) networks as a transparent conducting electrode. Current limitations to achieve high conversion efficiencies are overcome with the combination of Ag NW and specifically designed ZnO nanoparticles (NP). The new transparent electrode presents improved optoelectronic properties with respect to the most widely used ITO—indium tin oxide. We demonstrate that there are non-conducting void spaces left between neighboring nanowires onto the holding substrate as a consequence of processing the Ag NW film from a solvent dispersion. Moreover, the fabrication of efficient ITO-free organic solar cells (OSC) based on Ag NW relies on filling the resulting void spaces with a highly selective and conductive supporting thin layer. This slight modification of the Ag NW film enables the great majority of photogenerated charge carriers – that would otherwise be recombined at voids – to be efficiently collected by the nanowires. In this way, we report – to our knowledge – one of the highest ITO-free OSC (3.8%) also fabricated onto flexible substrates (3.2%) with commercially available Poly (3-Hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). This breakthrough could once and for all bring the potential of flexible low-cost organic photovoltaics into reality.

Abstract: A quantum chemical computational study has been performed at B3LYP/6-311G(d, p) level to investigate electronic structures of the C60 and C70 fullerene derivatives, as electron acceptor in bulk heterojunction solar cells, seeking ways to improve their efficiency in corresponding photovoltaic devices. The key point of the present survey is to achieve a significant linear correlation between the electrophilicity index calculated for the fullerene derivatives and the corresponding open-circuit voltage of the photovoltaic device. This index is a prominent feature in determining tendency of the fullerene derivative towards acquiring an additional electron from the adjacent electron-rich donor molecule, and also its resistance to give the electron back transfer. The results reveal that replacing butyric acid ester by propionic acid ester in the aliphatic part or increasing the donating strength of the substituent in the esteric part will cause an increase in electrophilicity. Considering the derivatives of C70 generally yields higher electrophilicity than those of C60 derivatives. Also for indene-C60 derivatives a significant increase in the electrophilicity is observed by increasing the number of adducts, leading to raise in the VOC values.

Abstract: Here we report the preparation of Ni–Al2O3 absorbing coatings by a facile aqueous solution-chemical method. In this approach, aluminum nitrate and nickel nitrate were simply mixed in water as precursor solution together with a chelating agent and a wetting agent, all of which were of low cost and available commercially. At high temperature and in N2 atmosphere, aluminum ions were converted into an Al2O3 matrix and nickel ions were in situ reduced into nano-size nickel particles embedded in the Al2O3 matrix. The optimum single layer attained a high normal solar absorptance of 0.85 and a low normal thermal emittance of 0.03. A three-layer coating, i.e. double absorption layers together with one top anti-reflection layer, exhibited better optical properties of absorptance/thermal emittance=0.93/0.05, respectively, and was stable in air up to 300°C.

Abstract: A patterned method was proposed to realize large area fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs) in series and parallel configurations. Series and parallel configurations of OSCs on ITO glass were designed and studied. Large open circuit voltage (VOC) was achieved in series OSCs, while the high short-circuit current (ISC) was achieved by using the parallel structure. A photovoltaic device composed of eight ITO/NiO/P3HT:PCBM/Al OSCs in series connection with area of 5×4cm2, VOC of 4.35V, ISC of 1.59mA and power conversion efficiency of 2.08% was achieved. This device succeeded in driving a group of 11 light emitting diodes. In addition, this patterned method a device with VOC of 1.5V and ISC of 18mA succeeded in driving a small motor.

Abstract: The fiber-based solar cell is an example of a three dimensional photovoltaic architecture that uses the natural mode structure of optical fibers to enhance light capture. In this work we explore the spectral response of such cells when the thickness of the absorbing layer is varied. We demonstrate two important consequences associated with this architecture. The first is that fiber-based devices generally require a thinner active layer than the analogous planar structure. This helps to avoid exciton recombination and reflection loss in the geometry. Secondly, the geometry exhibits a broader absorption and external quantum efficiency than its planar counterpart. We interpret this as being due to enhanced absorption of charge transfer excitons.

Abstract: The recent recognition of Plasmodium falciparum Hsp90 (PfHsp90) as a promising anti-malaria drug target has sparked interest in identifying factors that regulate its function and drug-interaction. Co-chaperones are well-known regulators of Hsp90's chaperone function, and certain members have been implicated in conferring protection against lethal cellular effects of Hsp90-specific inhibitors. In this context, studies on PfHsp90's co-chaperones are imperative to gain insight into the regulation of the chaperone in the malaria parasite. In this study, a putative co-chaperone P. falciparum Aha1 (PfAha1) was identified and investigated for its interaction and regulation of PfHsp90. A previous genome-wide yeast two-hybrid study failed to identify PfAha1's association with PfHsp90, which prompted us to use a directed assay to investigate their interaction. PfAha1 was shown to interact with PfHsp90 via the in vivo split-ubiquitin assay and the association was confirmed in vitro by GST pull-down experiments. The GST pull-down assay further revealed PfAha1's interaction with PfHsp90 to be dependent on MgCl2 and ATP, and was competed by co-chaperone Pfp23 that binds PfHsp90 under the same condition. In addition, the PfHsp90–PfAha1 complex was found to be sensitive to disruption by high salt, indicating a polar interaction between them. Using bio-computational modelling coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, the polar residue N108 in PfAha1 was found to be strategically located and essential for PfHsp90 interaction. The functional significance of PfAha1's interaction was clearly that of exerting a stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity of PfHsp90, likely to be essential for promoting the activation of PfHsp90's client proteins.

Abstract: Depositing a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) buffer layer or top-electrode from aqueous solution on a non-polar active layer in inverted organic solar cells is commonly considered a very challenging task. In this work we utilize spray deposited PEDOT:PSS seeds to effectively reduce the surface free energy atop the active layer in poly-hexylthiophene polymer solar cells before applying a PEDOT:PSS top-electrode. Though aqueous PEDOT:PSS is repelled from non-polar surfaces, very small droplets can adhere to the surface. The distribution of the sprayed PEDOT:PSS droplets can be controlled via the substrate temperature and the material flow rate. The less time the droplets have to contract along the surface before drying, the better is the surface seed coverage and the more homogenous is the formation of a subsequently deposited PEDOT:PSS electrode. The respective solar cells are semi-transparent and exhibit an overall power conversion efficiency η≈2%.

Abstract: Calreticulin (CRT), a 46kDa endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, is critical in the folding and quality control of proteins. However, the mechanisms of its regulation are not fully understood. Our previous study had demonstrated that elevated TNFα levels that are hallmarks of diverse metabolic diseases negatively regulate cellular CRT levels. Here, we attempted to study the mode of this regulation of CRT by TNFα. Using luciferase reporter deletion constructs of the CRT promoter, we demonstrate that while the −2kb and −1kb promoter constructs depict comparable activities, the activity of the −0.5kb region was greatly reduced suggesting the significance of the region between −1.0kb and −0.5kb during CRT promoter activity. Of the transcription factors that possess binding elements within this region, C/EBPα was prioritized since it was shown to be inhibited by TNFα in an earlier report from our laboratory. TNFα significantly inhibited the wild-type CRT promoter activity that was attenuated in a C/EBPα-deleted construct. C/EBPα mRNA levels and its nuclear content was also reduced in the presence of TNFα. This led to reduced C/EBPα occupancy on the CRT promoter and a decreased binding of the nuclear protein to the C/EBPα-consensus sequence. TNFα also reduced the nuclear content of C/EBPβ but it did not bind to the CRT promoter suggesting that it does not contribute to the inhibitory effect of TNFα. To conclude, our results suggest that C/EBPα is critical in mediating the inhibitory effect of TNFα on CRT expression that might be crucial in determining the deleterious cellular effects of TNFα.

Abstract: Cadmium sulfide (CdS) thin films are commonly used as buffer layers in thin film solar cells and can be produced by a number of solution and vacuum methods. We report the continuous solution deposition of CdS on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass substrates using Microreactor-Assisted Solution Deposition (MASD™). A flow system consisting of a microscale T-mixer and a novel adjustable residence time microchannel heat exchanger has been utilized in this study. The CdS thin film synthesis involves a multistage mechanism in which an undesirable homogeneous reaction competes with the desired heterogeneous reaction. A microchannel heat exchanger with an adjustable residence time unit has been developed to optimize the reaction residence time and favor heterogeneous growth. Optimization of CdS reaction solution residence time facilitates improved control of CdS synthesis by minimizing the homogeneous reaction and subsequently improving key parameters for process scale-up such as yield and selectivity. The present study indicates that a residence time range of 13–20s at a solution temperature of 90°C and deposition time of 3min yields ∼40nm thick CdS film. The CdS films were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, SEM–EDS, TEM, and X-ray diffraction.

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a new series connection method that employs alternating conventional and inverted bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The two adjacent cells in each submodule are connected through top or bottom ‘continuous terminals’ made of aluminum or indium tin oxide (ITO), which are shared by cells with different polarities in either a top-to-top or a bottom-to-bottom manner. In comparison with the conventional series-interconnection method, our new structure offers unique advantages in that both printing methods and efficient coating methods can be applied in the manufacturing of series-connected BHJ photovoltaic modules.

Abstract: Less conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP Al 4083) is usually used as a buffer layer in polymer solar cells. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be enhanced from 10−3 to 100Scm−1 through a treatment with a cosolvent of hydrophilic methanol and hydrophobic 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The conductivity enhancement is attributed to the preferential solvation of hydrophobic PEDOT and hydrophilic PSS chains with the two components of the cosolvent. It induces PSSH reduction of the PEDOT:PSS films and morphological change of the polymer chains. Moreover, the cosolvent treatment of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer can remarkably improve the photovoltaic efficiency of polymer solar cells. The treatment of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer with a cosolvent of methanol and DCB can improve the photovoltaic efficiency of polymer solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) from 3.98% to 4.31%. The PCE improvement is attributed to the high conductivity and high surface area of the cosolvent-treated PEDOT:PSS buffer layer.

Abstract: One of the main objectives of the current single c-Si photovoltaic research is to enhance solar cell efficiency with the low cost approach. A simple way to improve the solar cell efficiency is to enhance the absorption of light as much as possible. In this study, we reduced the finger width pattern from 80μm to 30μm and then double printed to minimize shadow loss without any increase in series resistance. The single screen printing of 80μm finger width resulted in efficiency of 17.66%, whereas 30μm finger width resulted in efficiency of 15.83%, which is due to a decrease in FF. An 18.06% efficient solar cell with Jsc of 37.31mA/cm2, Voc of 627.3mV and FF of 77.2% is obtained using the double screen printing pattern of 30μm wide fingers. The increase in finger thickness resulted in increase in FF and hence efficiency. This novel method can be applied for mass production due to the simple double screen printing process.

Abstract: The donor/acceptor inter-mixing in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is a critical parameter, often leading to irreproducible performance of the finished device. An alternative solution-processed device fabrication strategy towards a better control of the micro/nano-structured morphology consists of a sequential coating of the donor (e.g., poly-(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT) and the acceptor (e.g., [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM) from orthogonal solvents. We demonstrate that, in spite of the solvent orthogonality, this technique does not lead to a well-defined bilayer with a sharp interface, but it rather results in a graded vertical phase-separated junction, resulting from the diffusion of the PCBM in the P3HT bottom layer. We are able to control the diffusion of PCBM, which occurs preferentially in the amorphous P3HT domains, by easily varying the ratio between crystalline/amorphous domains in the P3HT. Such a ratio can be simply modified by changing the solvent for P3HT. We show that the donor–acceptor diffused bilayer (DB) junction is an intermediate structure which combines both advantages of the well-defined bilayer and conventional BHJ configurations. Indeed, the DB device geometry ensures the good reproducibility and charge percolation, like the well-defined bilayer, while preserving the interpenetration of the donor and acceptor species, resulting in an efficient charge separation, characteristic of the BHJ. Overall the annealed DB device geometry can be assimilated to a graded BHJ with an improved reproducibility and mean power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.45%, higher than that of the standard BHJ devices of 3.07%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the highest performance for the as-cast DB device with a PCE of 2.58%. It is worthy to note that our DB device exhibits improved open circuit voltage, fill factor, series and shunt resistances, which denote that the vertically phase separated DB junction ensures improved charge percolation.

Abstract: Phospholipase D plays an anti-apoptotic role but little is known about dynamics of phospholipase D turnover during apoptosis. We have recently identified phospholipase D1 as a new substrate of caspases which generates the N-terminal and C-terminal fragment of phospholipase D1. In the present study, we tried to investigate whether association of the caspase cleavage fragments may be involved in regulation of apoptosis. Ectopically expressed C-terminal fragment, but not N-terminal fragment of phospholipase D1, is exclusively imported into the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence; however, endogenous C-terminal fragment of phospholipase D1 from etoposide-induced apoptotic cells and Alzheimer's disease brain tissues with active caspase-3, was localized in the cytosolic fraction as well as the nuclear fraction. Intermolecular association between the two fragments of phospholipase D1 through hydrophobic residues within the catalytic motif inhibited nuclear localization of C-terminal fragment of phospholipase D1, and two catalytic motif and nuclear localization sequence regulated nuclocytoplasmic shuttling of phospholipase D1. Moreover, hydrophobic residues involved in the intermolecular association are also required for both its enzymatic activity and anti-apoptotic function. Taken together, we demonstrate that interdomain association and dissociation of phospholipase D1 might provide new insights into modulation of apoptosis.

Abstract: This work introduces metal assisted etching for surface texturing of saw-damage free crystalline silicon independent from the crystallographic orientation. A noble metal serves as a catalyst for the chemical etching in an aqueous solution containing hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid. Metal assisted textured String Ribbon solar cells show a reduction ΔReff=−16%rel for the effective reflection Reff compared to untextured String Ribbon solar cells. This improvement results in an increase ΔJsc=+1.4mA/cm2 of the short circuit current density Jsc. Therefore, the median solar cell efficiency η increases by Δη=+0.4% from ηuntex=14.1% to ηtex=14.5%.

Abstract: In this study, xylitol pentastearate and xylitol pentapalmitate were synthesized as novel solid–liquid PCMs by an esterification reaction in order to eliminate the unfavorable thermal properties of xylitol (such as high melting point) and stearic and palmitic acids (such as high melting point, low corrosivity, bad odor, and sublimating property). The synthesized ester compounds were characterized chemically by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy methods. By using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method, the melting temperatures of xylitol pentastearate and xylitol pentapalmitate were measured as 32.35°C and 18.75°C, respectively, while their latent heats of melting were determined as 205.65Jg−1 and 170.05Jg−1 respectively. These results indicate that the synthesized PCMs have high latent heat values and suitable phase change temperatures for thermal energy storage applications. The thermal cycling test shows that the synthesized PCMs have good thermal reliability after 1000 thermal cycles. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis results also reveal that the PCMs have good thermal stability over their working temperatures.

Abstract: The phase change behaviors of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/porous carbon composites are extensively studied. Three types of shape-stabilized PCMs were prepared using expanded graphite (EG), active carbon (AC) and ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-5) as supporting materials with various pore structures. They have distinct influences on the phase change behaviors of PEG/porous carbon composites. The highest stabilized PEG content is 70wt% for AC and 90% for both EG and CMK-5. The phase change enthalpy and the PEG crystallinity increases in the order AC<CMK-5<EG at the same PEG content in the composite. The study suggests that pores with micrometer size exhibit the same level of shape stabilization ability as the pores with nanometer size, while being able to minimize the enthalpy loss due to the interactions between the pores and the PEG chains. This study will provide insights into the design of composite PCMs through tailoring the pore structures.

Abstract: The long-wave radiative properties of a plastic shading net are essential to determine the thermal performance of a particular structure covered with this net. Nets are non-homogeneous, three-dimensional and semi-transparent materials, and therefore the radiative properties of a net cannot be measured in a laboratory using instruments designed for homogeneous materials. In addition, net radiometers cannot be used to measure these properties directly due to radiation emitted from the net surfaces. No suitable technique is presently available for determining the long-wave properties of shading nets. This paper describes a simple method for determining the total hemispherical long-wave radiative properties (i.e., transmittance, reflectance and absorptance or emittance) of nets. Nets with colors, porosities, texture type and nominal shading factors that are most commonly used in hot regions were selected for testing. The measurements were performed under equilibrium conditions (i.e., nighttime, steady-state and uniform sky thermal irradiance). The results show that the behaviors of plastic nets under thermal radiation conditions were different from those of translucent homogeneous materials. Net temperature and porosity were more important than texture type and color in determining transmittance and reflectance. The net temperature drop at night (6–10.5°C) caused shrinkage in the net. This resulted in a decrease in porosity, which in turn caused a decrease in transmittance and an increase in reflectance. For the nets tested, transmittance decreased from 1.2% to 6.3% per 1°C decrease in temperature. The reduction in transmittance was equal to the increase in reflectance. Emittance of the net depends on net temperature, color, porosity and texture type, although, at low temperature, none of these effects was significant.

Abstract: Preparation and characterization of TiAlSiN/TiAlSiON/SiO2 solar selective absorber is reported in this contribution. All layers were deposited in a continuous mode using an industrial equipment. The nitride and oxynitride were prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering and the SiO2 layer by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition. The optical constants of individual layers were calculated by modelling of spectral transmittance and reflectance of the individual layers. The three layered stack absorber was then designed using those optical properties. The thickness of the individual layers was optimised until a solar absorptance of 96% was obtained resulting in a total thickness of about 200nm, deposited in copper and extruded aluminium absorbers. An emissivity of 5% for an absorber temperature of 100°C was obtained by analyzing the measured data from a FTIR spectrometer with integrating sphere. After the test duration of 600h, the samples subjected to a thermal annealing at 278°C in air showed a performance criterion (PC) below 4%, while the samples in the humidity tests showed a PC below 2%.
