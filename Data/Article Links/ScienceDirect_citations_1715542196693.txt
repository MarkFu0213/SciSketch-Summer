Abstract: Fiducial-based correlation of fluorescence and electron microscopy data from high-pressure frozen and resin-embedded samples allows for high-precision localization of fluorescent signals to subcellular ultrastructure. Here we introduce the triCLEM procedure to facilitate the identification of very rare events for high-precision correlation. We present a detailed protocol to screen high-pressure frozen cell monolayers on sapphire disks for very rare signals by cryo-fluorescence microscopy, relocate the cells of interest after freeze substitution and Lowicryl embedding, and perform fiducial-based correlation of the identified fluorescent signals to high-magnification electron tomograms. We show the applicability of the protocol to localize and image damaged mitochondria marked by the presence of Parkin, a protein involved in initiating mitophagy. We discuss how this extension to previously published fiducial-based correlation procedures has potential to both allow identifying very rare events and assess the quality of preservation in high-pressure frozen samples.

Abstract: Hypothermia (HT) is a well-established neuroprotective strategy against neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The overexpression of heat shock proteins (HSP) has been shown to provide neuroprotection in animal models of stroke. We aimed to investigate the effect of HT on HSP70 and HSP27 expression in a neonatal rat model of HIE. Seven-day-old rat pups were exposed to hypoxia for 90 min to establish the Rice-Vannucci model and were assigned to the following four groups: hypoxic injury (HI)-normothermia (NT, 36 °C), HI-HT (30 °C), sham-NT, and sham-HT. After temperature intervention for 24 h, the mRNA and protein expression of HSP70 and HSP27 were measured. The association between HSP expression and brain injury severity was also evaluated. The brain infarct size was significantly smaller in the HI-HT group than in the HI-NT group. The mRNA and protein expression of both HSPs were significantly greater in the two HI groups, compared to those in the two sham groups. Moreover, among the rat pups subjected to HI, HT significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of both HSPs. The mRNA expression level of the HSPs was proportional to the brain injury severity. Post-ischemic HT, i.e., a cold shock attenuated the expression of HSP70 and HSP27 in a neonatal rat model of HIE. Our study suggests that neither HSP70 nor HSP27 expression is involved in the neuroprotective mechanism through which prolonged HT protects against neonatal HIE.

Abstract: Biomechanical strain induces activation of the transcriptional co-activator yes-associated protein (YAP) by nuclear re-distribution. Recent findings indicate that the mechanically responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 is involved in the amount of nuclear YAP, reflecting its activation. In this context, we conducted experiments to detect how biomechanical strain acts on the subcellular localization of YAP in periodontal cells. To this end, cells were subjected to 2.5% static equiaxial strain for different time periods. Western blot and fluorescence imaging-based analyses revealed a clear modulation of nuclear YAP localization. This modulation fairly coincided with the altered course of the KI-67 protein amount in conjunction with the percentage of KI-67-positive and thus proliferating cells. The inhibition of the ERK1/2 activity via U0126 yielded an unchanged strain-related modulation of nuclear YAP localization, while YAP amount in whole cell extracts of strained cells was decreased. Administration of the YAP-inhibiting drug Verteporfin evoked a clear reduction of KI-67-positive and thus proliferating cells by approximately 65%, irrespective of strain. Our data reveal YAP as a regulator of strain-modulated proliferation which occurs in a MAPK-independent fashion.

Abstract: Recent work reveals that actin acetylation modification has been linked to different normal and disease processes and the effects associated with metabolic and environmental stressors. Herein, we highlight the effects of calreticulin on actin acetylation and cell injury induced by microwave radiation in human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC). HMEC injury was induced by high-power microwave of different power density (10, 30, 60, 100 mW/cm2, for 6 min) with or without exogenous recombinant calreticulin. The cell injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and Cell Counting Kit-8 in culture medium, migration ability, intercellular junction, and cytoskeleton staining in HMEC. Western blotting analysis was used to detected calreticulin expression in cytosol and nucleus and acetylation of globular actin (G-actin). We found that HMEC injury was induced by microwave radiation in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment HMEC with calreticulin suppressed microwave radiation-induced LDH leakage and increased cell viability and improved microwave radiation-induced decrease in migration, intercellular junction, and cytoskeleton. Meanwhile, pretreatment HMEC with exogenous calreticulin upregulated the histone acetyltransferase activity and the acetylation level of G-actin and increased the fibrous actin (F-actin)/G-actin ratio. We conclude that exogenous calreticulin protects HMEC against microwave radiation-induced injury through promoting actin acetylation and polymerization.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal inflammation is frequently associated with an alteration of the gut microbiota, termed dysbiosis, which is characterized by a reduced abundance of obligate anaerobic bacteria and an expansion of facultative Proteobacteria such as commensal E. coli. The mechanisms enabling the outgrowth of Proteobacteria during inflammation are incompletely understood. Metagenomic sequencing revealed bacterial formate oxidation and aerobic respiration to be overrepresented metabolic pathways in a chemically induced murine model of colitis. Dysbiosis was accompanied by increased formate levels in the gut lumen. Formate was of microbial origin since no formate was detected in germ-free mice. Complementary studies using commensal E. coli strains as model organisms indicated that formate dehydrogenase and terminal oxidase genes provided a fitness advantage in murine models of colitis. In vivo, formate served as electron donor in conjunction with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. This work identifies bacterial formate oxidation and oxygen respiration as metabolic signatures for inflammation-associated dysbiosis.

Abstract: Summary
The guanidine-II (mini-ykkC) riboswitch is the smallest of the guanidine-responsive riboswitches, comprising two stem loops of similar sequence. We have solved high-resolution crystal structures of both stem loops for the riboswitch from Gloeobacter violaceus. The stem loops have a strong propensity to dimerize by intimate loop-loop interaction. The dimerization creates specific binding pockets for two guanidine molecules, explaining their cooperative binding. Within the binding pockets the ligands are hydrogen bonded to a guanine at O6 and N7, and to successive backbone phosphates. Additionally they are each stacked upon a guanine nucleobase. One side of the pocket has an opening to the solvent, slightly lowering the specificity of ligand binding, and structures with bound methylguanidine, aminoguanidine, and agmatine show how this is possible.

Abstract: Summary
Independently evolved pathogen effectors from three branches of life (ascomycete, eubacteria, and oomycete) converge onto the Arabidopsis TCP14 transcription factor to manipulate host defense. However, the mechanistic basis for defense control via TCP14 regulation is unknown. We demonstrate that TCP14 regulates the plant immune system by transcriptionally repressing a subset of the jasmonic acid (JA) hormone signaling outputs. A previously unstudied Pseudomonas syringae (Psy) type III effector, HopBB1, interacts with TCP14 and targets it to the SCFCOI1 degradation complex by connecting it to the JA signaling repressor JAZ3. Consequently, HopBB1 de-represses the TCP14-regulated subset of JA response genes and promotes pathogen virulence. Thus, HopBB1 fine-tunes host phytohormone crosstalk by precisely manipulating part of the JA regulon to avoid pleiotropic host responses while promoting pathogen proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Today, novel therapeutics are identified in an environment which is intrinsically different from the clinical context in which they are ultimately evaluated. Using molecular phenotyping and an in vitro model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, we show that by quantifying pathway reporter gene expression, molecular phenotyping can cluster compounds based on pathway profiles and dissect associations between pathway activities and disease phenotypes simultaneously. Molecular phenotyping was applicable to compounds with a range of binding specificities and triaged false positives derived from high-content screening assays. The technique identified a class of calcium-signaling modulators that can reverse disease-regulated pathways and phenotypes, which was validated by structurally distinct compounds of relevant classes. Our results advocate for application of molecular phenotyping in early drug discovery, promoting biological relevance as a key selection criterion early in the drug development cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental stresses are increasingly acknowledged as core causes of abnormal neural induction leading to neural tube defects (NTDs). However, the mechanism responsible for environmental stress-triggered neural induction defects remains unknown. Here, we report that a spectrum of environmental stresses, including oxidative stress, starvation, and DNA damage, profoundly activate SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylase. Both mouse embryos and in vitro differentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) demonstrated a negative correlation between the expression of SIRT1 and that of OCT6, a key neural fate inducer. Activated SIRT1 radically deacetylates OCT6, triggers an OCT6 ubiquitination/degradation cascade, and consequently increases the incidence of NTD-like phenotypes in mice or hinders neural induction in both human and mouse ESCs. Together, our results suggest that early exposure to environmental stresses results in the dysregulation of the SIRT1/OCT6 axis and increases the risk of NTDs.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of human skin epithelial cells are incompletely understood. As a consequence, the efficiency to establish a pure skin epithelial cell population from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) remains poor. Using an approach including RNAi and high-throughput imaging of early epithelial cells, we identified candidate kinases involved in their differentiation from hiPSCs. Among these, we found HIPK4 to be an important inhibitor of this process. Indeed, its silencing increased the amount of generated skin epithelial precursors at an early time point, increased the amount of generated keratinocytes at a later time point, and improved growth and differentiation of organotypic cultures, allowing for the formation of a denser basal layer and stratification with the expression of several keratins. Our data bring substantial input regarding regulation of human skin epithelial differentiation and for improving differentiation protocols from pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR γ) is activated by thiazolidinedione drugs (TZDs) and can promote anti-cancer properties. We used three TZDs (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, and ciglitazone) to target cervical cancer cell lines and a nude mouse animal model. Each agent increased activation of PPAR γ, as judged by a luciferase reporter gene assay in three HPV-associated cell lines (CaSki, SiHa, and HeLa cells) while decreasing cellular proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. They also promoted Oil Red O accumulation in treated cell lines and upregulated the lipid differentiation marker adipsin. Interestingly, xenograft HeLa tumors in nude mice treated with 100mg/kg/day pioglitazone exhibited decreased growth compared to control mice or mice treated with standard cervical chemotherapy. In conclusion, TZDs slow tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo with decreases in cell proliferation and increases in PPAR γ and adipsin. These agents may be interesting treatments or treatment adjuncts for HPV-associated cancers or perhaps even precancerous conditions.

Abstract: The lymphatic system is lined by endothelial cells and part of the vasculature. It is essential for tissue fluid homeostasis, absorption of dietary fats, and immune surveillance in vertebrates. Misregulation of lymphatic vessel formation and dysfunction of the lymphatic system have been indicated in a number of pathological conditions including lymphedema formation, obesity or chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In zebrafish, lymphatics were discovered about 10years ago, and the underlying molecular pathways involved in its development have since been studied in detail. Due to its superior live cell imaging possibilities and the broad tool kit for forward and reverse genetics, the zebrafish has become an important model organism to study the development of the lymphatic system during early embryonic development. In the current review, we will focus on the key players during zebrafish lymphangiogenesis and compare the roles of these genes to their mammalian counterparts. In particular, we will focus on novel findings that shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of lymphatic cell fate specification, as well as sprouting and migration of lymphatic precursor cells.

Abstract: Laminins are one of the major protein groups in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and specific laminin isoforms are crucial for neuronal functions in the central nervous system in vivo. In the present study, we compared recombinant human laminin isoforms (LN211, LN332, LN411, LN511, and LN521) and laminin isoform fragment (LN511-E8) in in vitro cultures of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons. We showed that laminin substrates containing the α5-chain are important for neuronal attachment, viability and network formation, as detected by phase contrast imaging, viability staining, and immunocytochemistry. Gene expression analysis showed that the molecular mechanisms involved in the preference of hPSC-derived neurons for specific laminin isoforms could be related to ECM remodeling and cell adhesion. Importantly, the microelectrode array analysis revealed the widest distribution of electrophysiologically active neurons on laminin α5 substrates, indicating most efficient development of neuronal network functionality. This study shows that specific laminin α5 substrates provide a controlled in vitro culture environment for hPSC-derived neurons. These substrates can be utilized not only to enhance the production of functional hPSC-derived neurons for in vitro applications like disease modeling, toxicological studies, and drug discovery, but also for the production of clinical grade hPSC-derived cells for regenerative medicine applications.

Abstract: We aimed at analyzing the effect of the 3D-arrangement on the expression of some genes and proteins which play a key role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression in HPAF-II, HPAC and PL45 PDAC cells cultured in either 2D-monolayers or 3D-spheroids. Cytokeratins 7, 8, 18, 19 were differently expressed in 3D-spheroids compared to 2D-monolayers. Syndecan 1 was upregulated in HPAF-II and PL45 3D-spheroids, and downregulated in HPAC. Heparanase mRNA levels were almost unchanged in HPAF-II, and increased in HPAC and PL45 3D-spheroids. Hyaluronan synthase (HAS) 2 and 3 mRNA increased in all 3D-spheroids compared to 2D-monolayers. CD44 and CD44s were expressed to a lower extent in HPAF-II and HPAC 3D-spheroids. By contrast, the CD44s/v3 and the CD44s/v6 ratio increased in HPAC and PL45 3D-spheroids, compared to 2D-monolayers. The expression of MMP-7 was strongly upregulated in 3D-spheroids. STAT3 was similarly expressed 3D-spheroids or 2D-monolayers, while pSTAT3 was almost undetectable in 2D-monolayers and strongly upregulated in 3D-spheroids. These results suggest that 3D-spheroids represent a cell culture model that allows the characterization of PDAC cell phenotype, adding new information that contributes to a better understanding of the biology and behavior of PDAC cells.

Abstract: In recent years, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has developed as an important alternative to mammalian models for the study of hostpathogen interactions. Because they lack a functional adaptive immune response during the first 4–6weeks of development, zebrafish rely upon innate immune responses to protect against injuries and infections. During this early period of development, it is possible to isolate and study mechanisms of infection and inflammation arising from the innate immune response without the complications presented by the adaptive immune response. Zebrafish possess several inherent characteristics that make them an attractive option to study hostpathogen interactions, including extensive sequence and functional conservation with the human genome, optical clarity in larvae that facilitates the high-resolution visualization of host cell–microbe interactions, a fully sequenced and annotated genome, robust forward and reverse genetic tools and techniques (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 and TALENs), and amenability to chemical studies and screens. Here, we describe methods for studying hostpathogen interactions both through systemic infections and through localized infections that allow analysis of host cell response, migration patterns, and behavior. Each of the methods described can be modified for use in downstream applications that include ecotoxicant studies and chemical screens.

Abstract: Summary
Specialized metabolites support bacterial competitive fitness as antibiotics, signals, pigments, and metal scavengers. Little is known about how specialized metabolites are processed and trafficked for their diverse competitive functions. Linearmycins A and B are linear polyketides with antifungal and antibacterial activity but are colony-localized in imaging mass spectrometry of Streptomyces sp. Mg1 (S. sp. Mg1). To decipher a connection between colony localization and antibiotic activity, we identified the linearmycin gene cluster and investigated linearmycin production and distribution by S. sp. Mg1. Our results uncover a large family of variant linearmycins with limited solubility in aqueous solution. We hypothesized that extracellular vesicles may traffic the lipid-like linearmycins. We found that vesicles isolated from culture supernatants contained linearmycins. Surprisingly, abolishing production of linearmycins in S. sp. Mg1 also diminished extracellular vesicle production. Our results reveal integration of linearmycin biosynthesis with production of extracellular vesicles, suggesting a deep connection between specialized metabolism and bacterial membrane physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Cultured spermatogonial stem cells (GSCs) can spontaneously form pluripotent cells in certain culture conditions. However, GSC reprogramming is a rare event that is largely unexplained. We show GSCs have high expression of mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) suppressors resulting in a developmental barrier inhibiting GSC reprogramming. Either increasing OCT4 or repressing transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling promotes GSC reprogramming by upregulating CDH1 and boosting MET. Reducing ZEB1 also enhances GSC reprogramming through its direct effect on CDH1. RNA sequencing shows that rare GSCs, identified as CDH1+ after trypsin digestion, are epithelial-like cells. CDH1+ GSCs exhibit enhanced reprogramming and become more prevalent during the course of reprogramming. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the spontaneous emergence of pluripotent cells from GSC cultures; namely, rare GSCs upregulate CDH1 and initiate MET, processes normally kept in check by ZEB1 and TGF-β signaling, thereby ensuring germ cells are protected from aberrant acquisition of pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Multipotent human central nervous system-derived neural stem cells transplanted at doses ranging from 10,000 (low) to 500,000 (very high) cells differentiated predominantly into the oligodendroglial lineage. However, while the number of engrafted cells increased linearly in relationship to increasing dose, the proportion of oligodendrocytic cells declined. Increasing dose resulted in a plateau of engraftment, enhanced neuronal differentiation, and increased distal migration caudal to the transplantation sites. Dose had no effect on terminal sensory recovery or open-field locomotor scores. However, total human cell number and decreased oligodendroglial proportion were correlated with hindlimb girdle coupling errors. Conversely, greater oligodendroglial proportion was correlated with increased Ab step pattern, decreased swing speed, and increased paw intensity, consistent with improved recovery. These data suggest that transplant dose, and/or target niche parameters can regulate donor cell engraftment, differentiation/maturation, and lineage-specific migration profiles.

Abstract: Limited growth potential, narrow ranges of sources, and difference in variability and functions from batch to batch of primary hepatocytes cause a problem for predicting drug-induced hepatotoxicity during drug development. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells in vitro are expected as a tool for predicting drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Several studies have already reported efficient methods for differentiating hPSCs into hepatocyte-like cells, however its differentiation process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, cost-intensive, and unstable. In order to solve this problem, expansion culture for hPSC-derived hepatic progenitor cells, including hepatic stem cells and hepatoblasts which can self-renewal and differentiate into hepatocytes should be valuable as a source of hepatocytes. However, the mechanisms of the expansion of hPSC-derived hepatic progenitor cells are not yet fully understood. In this study, to isolate hPSC-derived hepatic progenitor cells, we tried to develop serum-free growth factor defined culture conditions using defined components. Our culture conditions were able to isolate and grow hPSC-derived hepatic progenitor cells which could differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells through hepatoblast-like cells. We have confirmed that the hepatocyte-like cells prepared by our methods were able to increase gene expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes upon encountering rifampicin, phenobarbital, or omeprazole. The isolation and expansion of hPSC-derived hepatic progenitor cells in defined culture conditions should have advantages in terms of detecting accurate effects of exogenous factors on hepatic lineage differentiation, understanding mechanisms underlying self-renewal ability of hepatic progenitor cells, and stably supplying functional hepatic cells.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside at the apex of the hematopoietic hierarchy, giving rise to each of the blood lineages found throughout the lifetime of the organism. Since the genetic programs regulating HSC development are highly conserved between vertebrate species, experimental studies in zebrafish have not only complemented observations reported in mammals but have also yielded important discoveries that continue to influence our understanding of HSC biology and homeostasis. Here, we summarize findings that have established zebrafish as an important conserved model for the study of hematopoiesis, and describe methods that can be utilized for future investigations of zebrafish HSC biology.

Abstract: Mechanical properties of cells are known to be influenced by the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, the action of drugs that interact with the actin cortex is investigated by tether extraction and rheology experiments using optical tweezers. The influences of Blebbistatin, Cytochalasin D and Jasplakinolide on the cell mechanical properties are evaluated. The results, in contradiction to current views for Jasplakinolide, show that all three drugs and treatments destabilize the actin cytoskeleton, decreasing the cell membrane tension. The cell membrane bending modulus increased when the actin cytoskeleton was disorganized by Cytochalasin D. This effect was not observed for Blebbistatin and Jasplakinolide. All drugs decreased by two-fold the cell viscoelastic moduli, but only Cytochalasin D was able to alter the actin network into a more fluid-like structure. The results can be interpreted as the interplay between the actin network and the distribution of myosins as actin cross-linkers in the cytoskeleton. This information may contribute to a better understanding of how the membrane and cytoskeleton are involved in cell mechanical properties, underlining the role that each one plays in these properties.

Abstract: Bombesin receptor-activated protein (BRAP) is highly expressed in human bronchial epithelial cells. Recent studies have shown that BRAP reduces oxidative stress, inhibits airway inflammation and suppresses nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) activity. Mucus overproduction is an important feature in patients with chronic inflammatory airway diseases. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a potent inducer of mucin5AC (MUC5AC), which is considered the predominant mucin secreted by human airway epithelial cells. Here, we hypothesize that BRAP may regulate NE-induced MUC5AC hypersecretion in a bronchial epithelial cell line (HBE16). We also investigated the underlying mechanism involved in the process. In this study, we found that BRAP was present in HBE16 human bronchial epithelial cells and was significantly increased by NE. Next, we found that the up-regulation of BRAP by pEGFP-N1-BRAP caused a significant decrease in the increased levels of MUC5AC expression, NF-κB activity, and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induced by NE. Meanwhile, there was a significant decrease in ROS, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels when BRAP was up-regulated by pEGFP-N1-BRAP. Moreover, when cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1-BRAP and pretreated with NF-κB, ERK or EGFR inhibitors before the NE stimulation, there were further decreased in MUC5AC expression, NF-κB activity, and the phosphorylation of ERK and EGFR. These results suggest that BRAP plays an important role in airway inflammation and its overexpression may regulate NE-induced MUC5AC hypersecretion in HBE16 cells via the EGFR/ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Abstract: Membrane-type-1 Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a multifunctional protease that regulates ECM degradation, proMMP-2 activation, and varied cellular processes including migration and viability. MT1-MMP is believed to be a central mediator of tumourigenesis whose role is dictated by its functionally distinct protein domains. Both the localization and signal transduction capabilities of MT1-MMP are dependent on its cytoplasmic domain, exemplifying diverse regulatory functions. To further our understanding of the multifunctional contributions of MT1-MMP to cellular processes, we overexpressed cytoplasmic domain altered constructs in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and analyzed migration and viability in 2D culture conditions, morphology in 3D Matrigel culture, and tumorigenic ability in vivo. We found that the cytoplasmic domain was not needed for MT1-MMP mediated migration promotion, but was necessary to maintain viability during serum depravation in 2D culture. Similarly, during 3D Matrigel culture the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP was not needed to initiate a protrusive phenotype, but was necessary to prevent colony blebbing when cells were serum deprived. We also tested in vivo tumorigenic potential to show that cells expressing cytoplasmic domain altered constructs demonstrated a reduced ability to vascularize tumours. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain regulates MT1-MMP function in a manner required for cell survival, but is dispensable for cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
The monobactams, exemplified by the natural product sulfazecin, are the only class of β-lactam antibiotics not inactivated by metallo-β-lactamases, which confer bacteria with extended-spectrum β-lactam resistance. We screened a transposon mutagenesis library from Pseudomonas acidophila ATCC 31363 and isolated a sulfazecin-deficient mutant that revealed a gene cluster encoding two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), a methyltransferase, a sulfotransferase, and a dioxygenase. Three modules and an aberrant C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain are distributed across the two NRPSs. Biochemical examination of the adenylation (A) domains provided evidence that L-2,3-diaminopropionate, not L-serine as previously thought, is the direct source of the β-lactam ring of sulfazecin. ATP/PPi exchange assay also revealed an unusual substrate selectivity shift of one A domain when expressed with or without the immediately upstream condensation domain. Gene inactivation analysis defined a cluster of 13 open reading frames sufficient for sulfazecin production, precursor synthesis, self-resistance, and regulation. The identification of a key intermediate supported a proposed NRPS-mediated mechanism of sulfazecin biosynthesis and β-lactam ring formation distinct from the nocardicins, another NRPS-derived subclass of monocyclic β-lactam. These findings will serve as the basis for further biosynthetic research and potential engineering of these important antibiotics.

Abstract: Cytokinesis separates the cytoplasmic organelles and the duplicated genome into two daughter cells at the end of cell division. In animal cell cytokinesis, assembly and constriction of the contractile apparatus must be finely coordinated with plasma membrane remodeling and vesicle trafficking at the cleavage furrow. Accurate control of these events during cell cleavage is a fundamental task in all organisms and is also essential for maintaining ploidy and preventing neoplastic transformation. Drosophila male meiosis provides a well-suited cell system for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying cytokinesis, combining the powerful tools of Drosophila genetics with unique cytological characteristics. Remarkably the large size of male meiotic cells highly facilitates cytological analysis of cytokinesis. Here we describe the main procedures that we use for fixing and visualizing cleavage furrow proteins in male meiotic cells. Moreover, we detail our protocol to detect protein interactions in fixed dividing spermatocytes by applying in situ proximity ligation assay.

Abstract: The mitotic spindle is a highly organized and dynamic structure required for segregation of the genetic material into two daughter cells. Although most of the individual players involved in building the spindle have been characterized in vitro, a general understanding of how all of the spindle players act together in vivo is still missing. Hence, in recent years, experiments have focused on introducing mechanical perturbations of the spindle on a micron scale, thereby providing insight into its function and organization, as well as into forces acting in the spindle. Among different types of mechanical perturbations, optical ones are more flexible, less invasive, and more precise than other approaches. In this chapter, we describe a detailed protocol for cutting the microtubule bundles in human cells using a near-infrared femtosecond laser. This type of laser microsurgery provides the ability to precisely sever a single microtubule bundle while preserving spindle integrity and dynamics. Furthermore, we describe quantitative measurements obtained from the response of a severed microtubule bundle to laser ablation, which reveal the structure and function of individual parts of the spindle, such as the bridging fiber connecting sister k-fibers. Finally, the method described here can be easily combined with other quantitative techniques to address the complexity of the spindle.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine 5’-tetraphosphate (Ap4) is a ubiquitous metabolite involved in cell signaling in mammals. Its full physiological significance remains unknown. Here we show that two enzymes committed to NAD biosynthesis, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPT), can both catalyze the synthesis and degradation of Ap4 through their facultative ATPase activity. We propose a mechanism for this unforeseen additional reaction, and demonstrate its evolutionary conservation in bacterial orthologs of mammalian NAMPT and NAPT. Furthermore, evolutionary distant forms of NAMPT were inhibited in vitro by the FK866 drug but, remarkably, it does not block synthesis of Ap4. In fact, FK866-treated murine cells showed decreased NAD but increased Ap4 levels. Finally, murine cells and plasma with engineered or naturally fluctuating NAMPT levels showed matching Ap4 fluctuations. These results suggest a role of Ap4 in the actions of NAMPT, and prompt to evaluate the role of Ap4 production in the actions of NAMPT inhibitors.

Abstract: The highly glycosylated bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an abundant non-collagenous phosphoprotein in bone which enhances osteoblast differentiation and new bone deposition in vitro and in vivo. However, the structural details of its different glycosylation linkages have not been well studied and their functions in bone homeostasis are not clear. Previous studies suggested that the O-glycans, but not the N-glycans on BSP, are highly sialylated. Herein, we employed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to demonstrate that the N-glycanson the recombinant human integrin binding sialoprotein (rhiBSP) are also enriched in sialic acids (SAs) at their termini. We also identified multiple novel sites of N-glycan modification. Treatment of rhiBSP enhances osteoblast differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells and this effect could be partially reversed by efficient enzymatic removal of its N-glycans. Removal of all terminal SAs has a greater effect in reversing the effect of rhiBSP on osteogenesis, especially on mineralization, suggesting that sialylation at the termini of both N-glycans and O-glycans plays an important role in this regulation. Moreover, BSP-conjugated SAs may affect mineralization via ERK activation of VDR expression. Collectively, our results identified novel N-glycans enriched in SAs on the rhiBSP and demonstrated that SAs at both N- and O-glycans are important for BSP regulation of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
During nephrogenesis, stem/progenitor cells differentiate and give rise to early nephron structures that segment to proximal and distal nephron cell types. Previously, we prospectively isolated progenitors from human fetal kidney (hFK) utilizing a combination of surface markers. However, upon culture nephron progenitors differentiated and could not be robustly maintained in vitro. Here, by culturing hFK in a modified medium used for in vitro growth of mouse nephron progenitors, and by dissection of NCAM+/CD133− progenitor cells according to EpCAM expression (NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAM−, NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAMdim, NCAM+/CD133−/EpCAMbright), we show at single-cell resolution a preservation of uninduced and induced cap mesenchyme as well as a transitioning mesenchymal-epithelial state. Concomitantly, differentiating and differentiated epithelial lineages are also maintained. In vitro expansion of discrete stages of early human nephrogenesis in nephron stem cell cultures may be used for drug screening on a full repertoire of developing kidney cells and for prospective isolation of mesenchymal or epithelial renal lineages for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Combining in vivo imaging with electron microscopy (EM) uniquely allows monitoring rare and critical events in living tissue, followed by their high-resolution visualization in their native context. A major hurdle, however, is to keep track of the region of interest (ROI) when moving from intravital microscopy (IVM) to EM. Here, we present a workflow that relies on correlating IVM and microscopic X-ray computed tomography to predict the position of the ROI inside the EM-processed sample. The ROI can then be accurately and quickly targeted using ultramicrotomy and imaged using EM. We outline how this procedure is used to retrieve and image tumor cells arrested in the vasculature of the mouse brain.

Abstract: SIRT6, with both deacetylase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities, is predominantly expressed in the nucleus. It has been revealed that SIRT6 regulates various biological functions including metabolism, aging and stress resistance. This study aims to investigate the role of SIRT6 in vascular inflammation and it molecular mechanism. We found that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) did not alter the localization of SIRT6 in vascular adventitial fibroblasts (VAFs), vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The expression of SIRT1, SIRT6 was decreased in TNF-α-treated VAFs. In contrast, TNF-α significantly increased the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and interleukin (IL) −6. Knockdown of SIRT1 and SIRT6 by siRNA significantly enhanced TNF-α-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-6, respectively. Overexpression of SIRT1 and SIRT6 inhibited TNF-α-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-6 in VAFs. Moreover, we also found SIRT1 positively regulated the expression of SIRT6 in VAFs. In addition, knockdown of SIRT1 and SIRT6 respectively augmented TNF-α-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and Akt inhibitor MK2206 reduced TNF-α-induced mRNA expression of MCP-1 and IL-6 in VAFs. In vivo studies indicated that the expression of SIRT1, SIRT6 was decreased and the expression of MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-1β was increased in carotid collar-induced vascular inflammation. Taken together, these findings indicate that SIRT1 and SIRT6 inhibit TNF-α-induced inflammation in VAFs by ROS and Akt pathway.

Abstract: A hallmark of cancer cells is their ability to invade surrounding tissues and form metastases. Cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)-adhesion proteins are crucial in metastasis, connecting tumor ECM with actin cytoskeleton thus enabling cells to respond to mechanical cues. Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is an actin-polymerization regulator which interacts with cell-ECM adhesion protein Migfilin, and regulates cell migration. We compared VASP expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer (BC) cells and found that more invasive MDA-MB-231 cells overexpress VASP. We then utilized a 3-dimensional (3D) approach to study metastasis in MDA-MB-231 cells using a system that considers mechanical forces exerted by the ECM. We prepared 3D collagen I gels of increasing concentration, imaged them by atomic force microscopy, and used them to either embed cells or tumor spheroids, in the presence or absence of VASP. We show, for the first time, that VASP silencing downregulated Migfilin, β-catenin and urokinase plasminogen activator both in 2D and 3D, suggesting a matrix-independent mechanism. Tumor spheroids lacking VASP demonstrated impaired invasion, indicating VASP’s involvement in metastasis, which was corroborated by Kaplan-Meier plotter showing high VASP expression to be associated with poor remission-free survival in lymph node-positive BC patients. Hence, VASP may be a novel BC metastasis biomarker.

Abstract: Previously, we reported that GPR30 activation by the receptor-specific, non-estrogenic ligand G-1 inhibited in vitro and in vivo growth of prostate cancer (PCa) cells via sustained Erk1/2 activation. Mechanism underlying the sustained Erk1/2 activation for PCa cell growth inhibition remains unclear. Here we report that G-1, through GPR30, activated Gαi1 proteins to sustain Erk1/2 activation but failed to activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) for cAMP production in PCa cells. The chemical-induced activation of AC-cAMP-PKA signaling attenuated Erk1/2 activity and blocked the cell growth inhibitory effects of G-1. Furthermore, PCa predominantly expressed Gαi1 proteins. Silencing of Gαi1 expression blocked the inhibitory effects of G-1 on PCa cell growth. By gene expression profiling, GPR30 activation by G-1 interfered expression of cell cycle regulators and machinery elements to modulate PCa cell growth and the RACGAP1 interactome to control metastatic properties. In this regard, we demonstrated that G-1 inhibited PCa cell migration and invasion with reduced formations of filopodia and stress fibers through a GPR30-dependent pathway. Taken together, our findings revealed the underlying mechanism for sustaining Erk1/2 activation upon GPR30 activation by G-1 in PCa cells and the GPR30-mediated pathways in controlling PCa cell growth and metastatic properties.

Abstract: Zebrafish chemical screening allows for an in vivo assessment of small molecule modulation of biological processes. Compound toxicities, chemical alterations by metabolism, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and modulation of cell niches can be studied with this method. Furthermore, zebrafish screening is straightforward and cost effective. Zebrafish provide an invaluable platform for novel therapeutic discovery through chemical screening.

Abstract: Folding of the myosin head often requires the joint actions of Hsp90 and a dedicated UNC45, Cro1, She4 (UCS) domain-containing cochaperone protein. Relatively weak sequence conservation exists between the single UCS protein of simple eukaryotes (She4 in budding yeast) and the two UCS proteins of higher organisms (the general cell and smooth muscle UNC45s; UNC45-GC and UNC45-SM respectively). In vertebrates, UNC45-GC facilitates cytoskeletal function whereas the 55% identical UNC45-SM assists in the assembly of the contractile apparatus of cardiac and skeletal muscles. UNC45-SM, unlike UNC45-GC, shares with yeast She4 an IDSL sequence motif known to be a site of in vivo serine phosphorylation in yeast. Investigating this further, we found that both a non-phosphorylatable (S18A) and a phosphomimetic (S18E) mutant form of She4 could rescue the type 1 myosin localisation and endocytosis defects of the yeast she4Δ mutant at 39 °C. Nevertheless, at higher temperature (45 °C), only She4 (S18A), not She4(S18E), could substantially rescue the cell lysis defect of she4Δ mutant cells. In the yeast two-hybrid system, the non-phosphorylatable S18A and S251A mutant forms of She4 and UNC45-SM still displayed the stress-enhanced in vivo interaction with Hsp90 seen with the wild-type She4 and UNC45-SM. Such high-temperature enforcement to interaction was though lost with the phosphomimetic mutant forms (She4(S18E) and UNC45-SM (S251E)), an indication that phosphorylation might suppress these increases in She4/Hsp90 and UNC45-SM/Hsp90 interaction with stress.

Abstract: Although the zebrafish was initially developed as a model system to study embryonic development, it has gained increasing attention as an advantageous system to investigate human diseases, including intestinal disorders. Zebrafish embryos develop rapidly, and their digestive system is fully functional and visible by 5days post fertilization. There is a large degree of homology between the intestine of zebrafish and higher vertebrate organisms in terms of its cellular composition and function as both a digestive and immune organ. Furthermore, molecular pathways regulating injury and immune responses are highly conserved. In this chapter, we provide an overview of studies addressing developmental and physiological processes relevant to human intestinal disease. These studies include those related to congenital disorders, host–microbiota interactions, inflammatory diseases, motility disorders, and intestinal cancer. We also highlight the utility of zebrafish to functionally validate candidate genes identified through mutational analyses and genome-wide association studies, and discuss methodologies to investigate the intestinal biology that are unique to zebrafish.

Abstract: Fibrosarcoma is a tumor of mesenchymal origin, originating from fibroblasts. IGF-I is an anabolic growth factor which exhibits significant involvement in cancer progression. In this study, we investigated the possible participation of syndecan-2 (SDC-2), a cell membrane heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan on IGF-I dependent fibrosarcoma cell motility. Our results demonstrate that SDC-2-deficient HT1080 cells exhibit attenuated IGF-I-dependent chemotactic migration (p < 0.001). SDC-2 was found to co-localize to IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in a manner dependent on IGF-I activity (P ≤ 0.01). In parallel, the downregulation of SDC-2 significantly inhibited both basal and due to IGF-I action ERK1/2 activation, (p < 0.001). The phosphorylation levels of ezrin (Thr567), which is suggested to act as a signaling bridge between the cellular membrane receptors and actin cytoskeleton, were strongly enhanced by IGF-I at both 1h and 24h (p < 0.05; p < 0.01). The formation of an immunoprecipitative complex revealed an association between SDC2 and ezrin which was enhanced through IGF-I action (p < 0.05). Immunoflourescence demonstrated a co-localization of IGF-IR, SDC2 and ezrin upregulated by IGF-I action. IGF-I enhanced actin polymerization and ezrin/actin specific localization to cell membranes. Finally, treatment with IGF-I strongly increased SDC2 expression at both the mRNA and protein level (p < 0.001). Therefore, we propose a novel SDC2-dependent mechanism, where SDC2 is co-localized with IGF-IR and enhances its’ IGFI-dependent downstream signaling. SDC2 mediates directly IGFI-induced ERK1/2 activation, it recruits ezrin, contributes to actin polymerization and ezrin/actin specific localization to cell membranes, ultimately facilitating the progression of IGFI-dependent fibrosarcoma cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Hormones drive mammary development and function and play critical roles in breast cancer. Epidemiologic studies link prolactin (PRL) to increased risk for aggressive cancers that express estrogen receptor α (ERα). However, in contrast to ovarian steroids, PRL actions on the mammary gland outside of pregnancy are poorly understood. We employed the transgenic NRL-PRL model to examine the effects of PRL alone and with defined estrogen/progesterone exposure on stem/progenitor activity and regulatory networks that drive epithelial differentiation. PRL increased progenitors and modulated transcriptional programs, even without ovarian steroids, and with steroids further raised stem cell activity associated with elevated canonical Wnt signaling. However, despite facilitating some steroid actions, PRL opposed steroid-driven luminal maturation and increased CD61+ luminal cells. Our findings demonstrate that PRL can powerfully influence the epithelial hierarchy alone and temper the actions of ovarian steroids, which may underlie its role in the development of breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional latency of HIV is a last barrier to viral eradication. Chromatin-remodeling complexes and post-translational histone modifications likely play key roles in HIV-1 reactivation, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We performed an RNAi-based screen of human lysine methyltransferases and identified the SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2 (SMYD2) as an enzyme that regulates HIV-1 latency. Knockdown of SMYD2 or its pharmacological inhibition reactivated latent HIV-1 in T cell lines and in primary CD4+ T cells. SMYD2 associated with latent HIV-1 promoter chromatin, which was enriched in monomethylated lysine 20 at histone H4 (H4K20me1), a mark lost in cells lacking SMYD2. Further, we find that lethal 3 malignant brain tumor 1 (L3MBTL1), a reader protein with chromatin-compacting properties that recognizes H4K20me1, was recruited to the latent HIV-1 promoter in a SMYD2-dependent manner. We propose that a SMYD2-H4K20me1-L3MBTL1 axis contributes to HIV-1 latency and can be targeted with small-molecule SMYD2 inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Non-enzymatic protein modification driven by thioester reactivity is thought to play a major role in the establishment of cellular lysine acylation. However, the specific protein targets of this process are largely unknown. Here we report an experimental strategy to investigate non-enzymatic acylation in cells. Specifically, we develop a chemoproteomic method that separates thioester reactivity from enzymatic utilization, allowing selective enrichment of non-enzymatic acylation targets. Applying this method to cancer cell lines identifies numerous candidate targets of non-enzymatic acylation, including several enzymes in lower glycolysis. Functional studies highlight malonyl-CoA as a reactive thioester metabolite that can modify and inhibit glycolytic enzyme activity. Finally, we show that synthetic thioesters can be used as novel reagents to probe non-enzymatic acylation in living cells. Our studies provide new insights into the targets and drivers of non-enzymatic acylation, and demonstrate the utility of reactivity-based methods to experimentally investigate this phenomenon in biology and disease.

Abstract: Teeth develop through interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues mediated by a signaling network comprised of growth factors and transcription factors. However, little is known about how epigenetic modifiers affect signaling pathways and thereby regulate tooth formation. We previously reported that the histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase (MTase) G9a is specifically enriched in the tooth mesenchyme during mouse development. In this study, we investigated the functions of G9a in tooth development using G9a conditional knockout (KO) mice. We used Sox9-Cre mice to delete G9a in the tooth mesenchyme because Sox9 is highly expressed in the mesenchyme derived from the cranial neural crest. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that G9a expression was significantly decreased in the mesenchyme of Sox9-Cre;G9afl/fl (G9a cKO) mice compared with that in Sox9-Cre;G9a fl/+(control) mice. Protein levels of the G9a substrate H3K9me2 were also decreased in the tooth mesenchyme. G9a cKO mice showed smaller tooth germ after embryonic day (E) 16.5 and E17.5, but not at E15.5. The developing cusp tips, which were visible in control mice, were absent in G9a cKO mice at E17.5. At 3 weeks after birth, small first molars with smaller cusps and unseparated roots were formed. Organ culture of tooth germs derived from E15.5 cKO mouse embryos showed impaired tooth development, suggesting that tooth development per se is affected independently of skull development. BrdU labeling experiments revealed that the proliferation rates were decreased in the mesenchyme in G9a cKO mice at E17.5. In addition, the proliferation rates in the tooth inner enamel epithelium were also decreased. In situ hybridization revealed altered localization of genes associated with tooth development. In cKO mice, intensively localized expression of mRNAs encoding bone morphogenic protein (Bmp2 and Bmp4) was observed in the tooth mesenchyme at E17.5, similar to the expression patterns observed in control mice at E15.5. Localization of Shh and related signaling components, including Gli1, Ptch1, and Ptch2, in the tooth mesenchyme of cKO mice was generally similar to that at earlier stages in control mice. In addition, expression of Fgf3 and Fgf10 in the mesenchyme was decreased in G9a cKO mice at P0. Expression levels of Fgf9 and p21, both of which were expressed in the secondary enamel-knot, were also decreased. Thus, the expression of genes associated with tooth development was delayed in cKO mice. Our results suggest that H3K9MTase G9a regulates cell proliferation and timing of differentiation and that G9a expression in the tooth mesenchyme is required for proper tooth development.

Abstract: Summary
Satellite cells are skeletal-muscle-specific stem cells that are activated by injury to proliferate, differentiate, and fuse to enable repair. SOX7, a member of the SRY-related HMG-box family of transcription factors is expressed in quiescent satellite cells. To elucidate SOX7 function in skeletal muscle, we knocked down Sox7 expression in embryonic stem cells and primary myoblasts and generated a conditional knockout mouse in which Sox7 is excised in PAX3+ cells. Loss of Sox7 in embryonic stem cells reduced Pax3 and Pax7 expression. In vivo, conditional knockdown of Sox7 reduced the satellite cell population from birth, reduced myofiber caliber, and impaired regeneration after acute injury. Although Sox7-deficient primary myoblasts differentiated normally, impaired myoblast fusion and increased sensitivity to apoptosis in culture and in vivo were observed. Taken together, these results indicate that SOX7 is dispensable for myogenesis but is necessary to promote satellite cell development and survival.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammasome activation is an important innate immune defense mechanism against bacterial infection, and in return, bacteria express virulence determinants that counteract inflammasome activation. Many such effectors are secreted into host cells via specialized bacterial secretion systems. Here, the intracellular pathogenic bacterium Edwardsiella tarda was demonstrated to activate NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes via a type III secretion system (T3SS), and to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome via a type VI secretion system (T6SS), indicating the antagonistic roles of these systems in inflammasome signaling. Furthermore, a non-VgrG T6SS effector, EvpP, was identified that significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Subsequent studies revealed that EvpP significantly suppressed Jnk activation, thus impairing oligomerization of the inflammasome adaptor ASC. Moreover, EvpP counteracted cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase, which works upstream of Jnk activation to regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Finally, EvpP-mediated inflammasome inhibition promoted bacterial colonization in vivo. This work expands our understanding of bacterial T6SS in counteracting host immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Recent progress in the field of genetic code reprogramming using a reconstituted cell-free translation system has made it possible to incorporate a wide array of non-proteinogenic amino acids, including N-methyl-amino acids and D-amino acids. Despite the fact that up to ten N-methyl-amino acid residues can be continuously elongated, the successive incorporation of even two D-amino acids into a nascent peptide chain remains a formidable challenge, thus far being nearly impossible. Here we report achievement of continuous D-amino acid elongation by the use of engineered tRNAs and optimized concentrations of translation factors, enabling us to incorporate up to ten consecutive D-Ser residues into a nascent peptide chain. We have also expressed macrocyclic peptides consisting of four or five consecutive D-amino acids consisting of D-Phe, D-Ser, D-Ala, or D-Cys closed by either a disulfide bond or a thioether bond.

Abstract: NADPH oxidase (NOX) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been suggested to mediate cell proliferation in some cancers. Here, we show that an increase in the expression of NOX5 long form (NOX5-L) is critical for tumor progression in breast tumor tissues. Immunostaining of clinical samples indicated that NOX5 was overexpressed in 41.1% of breast ductal carcinoma samples. NOX5-L depletion consistently suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro. Antibody-mediated neutralization of NOX5-L attenuated tumor progression in a mouse xenograft model. Promoter analysis revealed that NOX5-L expression is regulated by STAT5A in breast cancer cells. Based on our novel findings, we suggest that inhibition of NOX5-L may be a promising therapeutic strategy that exerts anti-cancer effects via the modulation of ROS-mediated cell signaling.

Abstract: Activin A belongs to the superfamily of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and is a critical regulatory cytokine in breast cancer and inflammation. However, the role of activin A in migration of breast cancer cells and immune cells was not well characterized. Here, a microfluidic device was used to examine the effect of activin A on the migration of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells and human blood neutrophils as well as their migratory interaction. We found that activin A promoted the basal migration but impaired epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced migration of breast cancer cells. By contrast, activin A reduced neutrophil chemotaxis and transendothelial migration to N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Finally, activin A promoted neutrophil chemotaxis to the supernatant from breast cancer cell culture. Collectively, our study revealed the different roles of activin A in regulating the migration of breast cancer cells and neutrophils and their migratory interaction. These findings suggested the potential of activin A as a therapeutic target for inflammation and breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus employs the receptor histidine kinase (RHK), AgrC, to detect quorum-sensing (QS) pheromones, the autoinducer peptides (AIPs), which regulate the virulence of the bacterium. Variation in the QS circuit divides S. aureus into four subgroups, each producing a specific AIP-AgrC pair. While the timing of QS induction is known to differ among these subgroups, the molecular basis of this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we report the successful reconstitution of several AgrC variants and show that the agonist-induced activity of the receptors varies in a manner that accounts for these temporal differences in QS induction. Our studies also reveal a key regulatory hotspot on AgrC that controls the basal activity of RHK as well as the responsiveness of the system to ligand inputs. Collectively, these studies offer insights into the capacity of the RHK for adaptive evolution.

Abstract: DNA polymeric films (DNA-PFs) are a promising drug delivery system (DDS) in modern medicine. In this study, we evaluated the growth behavior of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells on DNA-PFs. The morphological, biochemical, and cytometric features of OSCC cell adhesion on DNA-PFs were also assessed. An initial, temporary alteration in cell morphology was observed at early time points owing to the inhibition of cell attachment to the film, which then returned to a normal morphological state at later time points. MTT and resazurin assays showed a moderate reduction in cell viability related to increased DNA concentration in the DNA-PFs. Flow cytometry studies showed low cytotoxicity of DNA-PFs, with cell viabilities higher than 90% in all the DNA-PFs tested. Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis also showed average cell cycle phase distributions at later time points, indicating that OSCC cell growth is maintained in the presence of DNA-PFs. These results show high biocompatibility of DNA-PFs and suggest their use in designing “dressing material,” where the DNA film acts as a support for cell growth, or with incorporation of active or photoactive compounds, which can induce tissue regeneration and are useful to treat many diseases, especially oral cancer.

Abstract: Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are a key cellular component of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment and are considered to contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis. Multiple cytokines and growth factors derived from PSCs are involved in malignant cancer progression, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). However, the molecular mechanisms by which HGF regulates cancer invasion and metastasis have not been completely elucidated. Here, we report that two pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines, Panc-1 and SW1990, displayed different invasive and migratory abilities after treatment with HGF secreted by PSCs. We found that HGF enhanced the invasive and migratory capacity of Panc-1 cells because of P53 deficiency, leading to overexpression of c-Met, which was regulated through P21. Additionally, our data showed that HGF/c-Met-mediated invasion and migration required the upregulation of survivin expression. In conclusion, PSCs promote PC cells invasion and migration via the HGF/c-Met/survivin pathway, which is negatively regulated by P53/P21.

Abstract: Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to be involved in initiation, progression and metastasis of various cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of how CAFs affects the biological function of oral cancer (OC) has not been fully-addressed. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-124 was downregulated in oral CAFs and oral cancer cells (OCCs) when compared with matched normal fibroblasts (NFs). Hypermethylation in the promoter region of miR-124 genes was accounted for its downregulation. Interestingly, CAFs but not NFs exerted promotion effect on OCCs cell proliferation, migration and tumor growth in CAFs/NFs-OCCs co-culture. Furthermore, we identified Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8) as two direct targets of miR-124. Over-expression of miR-124 in CAFs-OCCs co-culture abrogated CAFs-promoted OCCs cell growth and migration, and this inhibitory effect can be rescued by addition of CCL2 and IL-8. Finally, we showed that restoration of miR-124 expression by lentiviral infection or formulated miR-124 injection inhibited oral tumor growth in vivo suggesting miR-124 rescue could be a potential rationale for therapeutic applications in oral cancer in the future.

Abstract: In vitro immunization with antigens and cytokines triggers specific human B-cell response in short periods and is therefore superior to conventional in vivo immunization for antibody development. However, this new technology is limited by low efficiency, poor reproducibility, and requirement of pre-immunized lymphocytes. In this study, we demonstrate a novel method for de novo inducing antigen-specific human B cells in vitro. Unlike previous in vitro immunization of unfractionated PBMCs, we firstly optimized the conditions for inducing monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) to efficiently capture, process, and present antigens. Instead of using the conventional method to activate Th2 cells for in vitro immunization, we succeeded to differentiate naïve CD4+ T cells into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells using antigen-sensitized DCs and cytokine cocktail. We discovered the differentiated T cells expressed ICOS, PD-1, BCL-6, and IL-21 at high levels. After 12 days of T-B co-culture, we observed induced T cells efficiently promoted naïve B cells to differentiate into plasmablasts secreting antigen-specific antibodies, with expression of Blimp-1 and AID related to affinity maturation and class switching. Thus, we established a new co-culture system with naïve lymphocyte populations for de novo acquisition of specifically in vitro immunized B cells potentially for development of therapeutic antibodies, which also provides novel insights into understanding the complex interactions among immune cells in lymph nodes.

Abstract: Array Tomography (AT) is a relatively easy-to-use and yet powerful method to put molecular identity in its full ultrastructural context. Ultrathin sections are stained with fluorophores and then imaged by light and afterward by electron microscopy to obtain a correlated view of a region of interest: its ultrastructure and specific staining. By combining AT with high-pressure freezing for superior structural preservation and superresolution light microscopy, even small subcellular structures can be mapped in 3D. We established protocols for the application of superresolution AT on ultrathin plastic sections of Caenorhabditis elegans, Trypanosoma brucei, and brain tissue of Cataglyphis fortis and Apis mellifera. All steps are described in detail from sample preparation to 3D reconstruction, including species-specific modifications. We thus showcase the versatility of our protocol and give some examples for biological questions that can be answered with this technique. We offer a step-by-step recipe for superresolution AT that can be easily applied for C. elegans, T. brucei, C. fortis, and A. mellifera and adapted for other model systems.

Abstract: Tendons are important components of our musculoskeletal system. Injuries to these tissues are very common, resulting from occupational-related injuries, sports-related trauma, and age-related degeneration. Unfortunately, there are few treatment options, and current therapies rarely restore injured tendons to their original function. An improved understanding of the pathways regulating their development and repair would have significant impact in stimulating the formulation of regenerative-based approaches for tendon injury. The zebrafish provides an ideal system in which to perform genetic and chemical screens to identify new pathways involved in tendon biology. Until recently, there had been few descriptions of tendons and ligaments in the zebrafish and their similarity to mammalian tendon tissues. In this chapter, we describe the development of the zebrafish tendon and ligament tissues in the context of their gene expression, structure, and interactions with neighboring musculoskeletal tissues. We highlight the similarities with tendon development in higher vertebrates, showing that the craniofacial tendons and ligaments in zebrafish morphologically, molecularly, and structurally resemble mammalian tendons and ligaments from embryonic to adult stages. We detail methods for fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry as an assay to examine morphological changes in the zebrafish musculoskeleton. Staining assays such as these could provide the foundation for screen-based approaches to identify new regulators of tendon development, morphogenesis, and repair. These discoveries would provide new targets and pathways to study in the context of regenerative medicine–based approaches to improve tendon healing.

Abstract: Summary
Shewanella algae B516 produces avaroferrin, an asymmetric hydroxamate siderophore, which has been shown to inhibit swarming motility of Vibrio alginolyticus. We aimed to elucidate the biosynthesis of this siderophore and to investigate how S. algae coordinates the production of avaroferrin and its two symmetric counterparts. We reconstituted the reaction in vitro with the main enzyme AvbD and the putative biosynthetic precursors, and demonstrate that multispecificity of this enzyme results in the production of all three cyclic hydroxamate siderophores that were previously isolated as natural products from S. algae. Surprisingly, purified AvbD exhibited a clear preference for the larger cadaverine-derived substrate. In live cells, however, siderophore ratios are maximized toward avaroferrin production, and we demonstrate that these siderophore ratios are the result of a regulation on substrate pool level, which may allow rapid evolutionary adaptation to environmental changes. Our results thereby give insights into a unique evolutionary strategy toward metabolite diversity.

Abstract: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon malignancy of the salivary glands that is characterized by local recurrence and distant metastasis due to its resistance to conventional therapy. Platinum-based therapies have been extensively explored as a treatment for ACC, but they show little effectiveness. Studies have shown that a specific group of tumor cells, harboring characteristics of cancer stem cells (CSCs), are involved in chemoresistance of myeloid leukemias, breast, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas. Therapeutic strategies that target CSCs improve the survival of patients by decreasing the rates of tumor relapse, and epigenetic drugs, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), have shown promising results in targeting CSCs. In this study, we investigated the effect of the HDACi Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (Vorinostat), and cisplatin, alone or in combination, on CSCs and non-CSCs from ACC. We used CSCs as a biological marker for tumor resistance to therapy in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples and ACC primary cells. We found that cisplatin reduced tumor viability, but enriched the population of CSCs. Systemic administration of Vorinostat reduced the number of detectable CSCs in vivo and in vitro, and a low dose of Vorinostat decreased tumor cell viability. However, the combination of Vorinostat and cisplatin was extremely effective in depleting CSCs and reducing tumor viability in all ACC primary cells by activating cellular senescence. These observations suggest that HDACi and intercalating agents act more efficiently in combination to destroy tumor cells and their stem cells.

Abstract: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The life cycle of this protozoan parasite is digenetic because it alternates its different developmental forms through two hosts, a vector insect and a vertebrate host. As a result, the parasites are exposed to sudden and drastic environmental changes causing cellular stress. The stress response to some types of stress has been studied in T. cruzi, mainly at the molecular level; however, data about ultrastructure and physiological state of the cells in stress conditions are scarce or null. In this work, we analyzed the morphological, ultrastructural, and physiological changes produced on T. cruzi epimastigotes when they were exposed to acid, nutritional, heat, and oxidative stress. Clear morphological changes were observed, but the physiological conditions varied depending on the type of stress. The maintenance of the physiological state was severely affected by heat shock, acidic, nutritional, and oxidative stress. According to the surprising observed growth recovery after damage by stress alterations, different adaptations from the parasite to these harsh conditions were suggested. Particular cellular death pathways are discussed.

Abstract: Summary
The human retrovirus HTLV-1 causes a hematological malignancy or neuroinflammatory disease in ∼10% of infected individuals. HTLV-1 primarily infects CD4+ T lymphocytes and persists as a provirus integrated in their genome. HTLV-1 appears transcriptionally latent in freshly isolated cells; however, the chronically active anti-HTLV-1 cytotoxic T cell response observed in infected individuals indicates frequent proviral expression in vivo. The kinetics and regulation of HTLV-1 proviral expression in vivo are poorly understood. By using hypoxia, small-molecule hypoxia mimics, and inhibitors of specific metabolic pathways, we show that physiologically relevant levels of hypoxia, as routinely encountered by circulating T cells in the lymphoid organs and bone marrow, significantly enhance HTLV-1 reactivation from latency. Furthermore, culturing naturally infected CD4+ T cells in glucose-free medium or chemical inhibition of glycolysis or the mitochondrial electron transport chain strongly suppresses HTLV-1 plus-strand transcription. We conclude that glucose metabolism and oxygen tension regulate HTLV-1 proviral latency and reactivation in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are highly associated with therapy resistance and metastasis. Interplay between CSCs and various immune components is required for tumor survival. However, the response of CSCs to complement surveillance remains unknown. Herein, using stem-like sphere-forming cells prepared from a mammary tumor and a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, we found that CD59 was upregulated to protect CSCs from complement-dependent cytotoxicity. CD59 silencing significantly enhanced complement destruction and completely suppressed tumorigenesis in CSC-xenografted nude mice. Furthermore, we identified that SOX2 upregulates CD59 in epithelial CSCs. In addition, we revealed that SOX2 regulates the transcription of mCd59b, leading to selective mCD59b abundance in murine testis spermatogonial stem cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that CD59 regulation by SOX2 is required for stem cell evasion of complement surveillance. This finding highlights the importance of complement surveillance in eliminating CSCs and may suggest CD59 as a potential target for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The introduction of megabase-sized large DNA fragments into the germline has been a difficult task. Although microcell-mediated chromosome transfer into mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) allows the production of transchromosomic mice, ESCs have unstable karyotypes and germline transmission is unreliable by chimera formation. As spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the only stem cells in the germline, they represent an attractive target for germline modification. Here, we report successful transfer of a mouse artificial chromosome (MAC) into mouse germline stem cells (GSCs), cultured spermatogonia enriched for SSCs. MAC-transferred GSCs maintained the host karyotype and MAC more stably than ESCs, which have significant variation in chromosome number. Moreover, MAC-transferred GSCs produced transchromosomic mice following microinjection into the seminiferous tubules of infertile recipients. Successful transfer of MACs to GSCs overcomes the problems associated with ESC-mediated germline transmission and provides new possibilities in germline modification.

Abstract: Induction of HSP72 is a natural response of stressed organisms that protects against many insults including bacterial diseases in farm (aquatic) animals. It would therefore be of great health benefit to search for natural compounds that are clinically safe yet able to induce HSP72 in animals. The phenolic compound carvacrol, an approved food component, had been shown in in vitro study to act as a co-inducer of HSP72, enhancing HSP72 production only in combination with a bona fide stress compared to the compound alone. However, in vitro model systems do not completely represent an in vivo physiology. Here, using the well-established gnotobiotic Artemia model system, we determined whether carvacrol could induce HSP72 in vivo, whether this putative effect could generate resistance in Artemia against biotic/abiotic stress and also unraveled the mechanism behind the possible HSP72-inducing effect of carvacrol. The gnotobiotic system is crucial for such studies because it avoids the interference of any extraneous factors on host-compound interaction. Here, carvacrol was shown to be a potent HSP72 inducer. Induction of HSP72 was associated with the generation of resistance in Artemia larvae against subsequent lethal heat stress or pathogenic Vibrio harveyi. Our results also provided new insight on the mode of HSP72 inducing action of carvacrol, in which the initial generation of reactive molecule H2O2 by the compound plays a key role. Overall results add new information about the bioactivity of carvacrol and advance our knowledge of this compound as potential prophylactic agent for controlling Vibrio infection in aquaculture animals.

Abstract: Most human neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic and appear later in life. Aging and neurodegeneration are closely associated, and recent investigations reveal that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in the progression of these features. Immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) is an ER chaperone that is central to ER functions. We produced knock-in mice expressing a mutant BiP that lacked the retrieval sequence to elucidate the effect of a functional defect in an ER chaperone in multicellular organisms. The homozygous mutant BiP mice died within several hours after birth because of respiratory failure with an impaired biosynthesis of pulmonary surfactant by alveolar type II cells. The heterozygous mutant BiP mice grew up to be apparently normal adults, although some of them revealed motor disabilities as they aged. Here, we report that the synthesis of a mitochondrial protein, pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1), is enhanced in the brains of homozygous mutant BiP mice. We performed a two-dimensional gel analysis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. PYCR1 was identified as one of the enhanced proteins. We also found that sublethal ER stress caused by tunicamycin treatment induced the synthesis of PYCR1 in murine fibroblasts. PYCR1 has been shown to be related to the aging process. Mutations in the PYCR1 gene cause cutis laxa with progeroid features and mental retardation. These findings suggest a pathophysiological interaction between ER stress and a mitochondrial function in aging.

Abstract: Summary
Of the thousands of long noncoding RNAs expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), few have known roles and fewer have been functionally implicated in the regulation of self-renewal and pluripotency, or the reprogramming of somatic cells to the pluripotent state. In ESCs, Cyrano is a stably expressed long intergenic noncoding RNA with no previously assigned role. We demonstrate that Cyrano contributes to ESC maintenance, as its depletion results in the loss of hallmarks of self-renewal. Delineation of Cyrano's network through transcriptomics revealed widespread effects on signaling pathways and gene expression networks that contribute to ESC maintenance. Cyrano shares unique sequence complementarity with the differentiation-associated microRNA, mir-7, and mir-7 overexpression reduces expression of a key self-renewal factor to a similar extent as Cyrano knockdown. This suggests that Cyrano functions to restrain the action of mir-7. Altogether, we provide a view into the multifaceted function of Cyrano in ESC maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to form teratomas in vivo containing multiple somatic cell types is regarded as functional evidence of pluripotency for human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Since the Teratoma assay is animal dependent, laborious, and only qualitative, the PluriTest and the hPSC ScoreCard assay have been developed as in vitro alternatives. Here we compared normal hPSCs, induced hPSCs (hiPSCs) with reactivated reprogramming transgenes, and human embryonal carcinoma cells (hECs) in these assays. While normal hPSCs gave rise to typical teratomas, the xenografts of the hECs and the hiPSCs with reactivated reprogramming transgenes were largely undifferentiated and malignant. The hPSC ScoreCard assay confirmed the line-specific differentiation propensities in vitro. However, when undifferentiated cells were analyzed by the PluriTest, only hECs were identified as abnormal whereas all other cell lines were indistinguishable and resembled normal hPSCs. Our results indicate that pluripotency assays are best selected on the basis of intended downstream applications.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are increasingly implicated in brain pathology, particularly neurodegenerative disease, with many genes implicated in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and motor neuron disease expressed in microglia. There is, therefore, a need for authentic, efficient in vitro models to study human microglial pathological mechanisms. Microglia originate from the yolk sac as MYB-independent macrophages, migrating into the developing brain to complete differentiation. Here, we recapitulate microglial ontogeny by highly efficient differentiation of embryonic MYB-independent iPSC-derived macrophages then co-culture them with iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Co-cultures retain neuronal maturity and functionality for many weeks. Co-culture microglia express key microglia-specific markers and neurodegenerative disease-relevant genes, develop highly dynamic ramifications, and are phagocytic. Upon activation they become more ameboid, releasing multiple microglia-relevant cytokines. Importantly, co-culture microglia downregulate pathogen-response pathways, upregulate homeostatic function pathways, and promote a more anti-inflammatory and pro-remodeling cytokine response than corresponding monocultures, demonstrating that co-cultures are preferable for modeling authentic microglial physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors that control lipid homeostasis. SREBP activation is regulated by a negative feedback loop in which sterols bind to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), an escort protein essential for SREBP activation, or to insulin-induced genes (Insigs) (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] anchor proteins), sequestering the SREBP-SCAP-Insig complex in the ER. We screened a chemical library of endogenous molecules and identified 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) as an inhibitor of SREBP activation. Unlike sterols and other SREBP inhibitors, 25OHD impairs SREBP activation by inducing proteolytic processing and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SCAP, thereby decreasing SREBP levels independently of the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed to reduce the risk of metabolic diseases, but the mechanisms are unknown. The present results suggest a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism of vitamin D-mediated lipid control that might be useful in the treatment of metabolic diseases.

A novel immunofluorescence method to visualize microtubules in the antiparallel overlaps of microtubule-plus ends in the anaphase and telophase midzone,

Abstract: Cell division, in which duplicated chromosomes are separated into two daughter cells, is the most dynamic event during cell proliferation. Chromosome movement is powered mainly by microtubules, which vary in morphology and are organized into characteristic structures according to mitotic progression. During the later stages of mitosis, antiparallel microtubules form the spindle midzone, and the irregular formation of the midzone often leads to failure of cytokinesis, giving rise to the unequal segregation of chromosomes. However, it is difficult to analyze the morphology of these microtubules because microtubules in the antiparallel overlaps of microtubule-plus ends in the midzone are embedded in highly electron-dense matrices, impeding the access of anti-tubulin antibodies to their epitopes during immunofluorescence staining. Here, we developed a novel method to visualize selectively antiparallel microtubule overlaps in the midzone. When cells are air-dried before fixation, aligned α-tubulin staining is observed and colocalized with PRC1 in the center of the midzone of anaphase and telophase cells, suggesting that antiparallel microtubule overlaps can be visualized by this method. In air-dried cells, mCherry-α-tubulin fluorescence and β-tubulin staining show almost the same pattern as α-tubulin staining in the midzone, suggesting that the selective visualization of antiparallel microtubule overlaps in air-dried cells is not attributed to an alteration of the antigenicity of α-tubulin. Taxol treatment extends the microtubule filaments of the midzone in air-dried cells, and nocodazole treatment conversely decreases the number of microtubules, suggesting that unstable microtubules are depolymerized during the air-drying method. It is of note that the air-drying method enables the detection of the disruption of the midzone and premature midzone formation upon Aurora B and Plk1 inhibition, respectively. These results suggest that the air-drying method is suitable for visualizing microtubules in the antiparallel overlaps of microtubule-plus ends of the midzone and for detecting their effects on midzone formation.

Abstract: Osteoblasts and osteoclasts coordinate to monitor the dynamic osteogenic balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Hence, an investigation of the regulatory mechanisms underlying osteogenic osteoblast differentiation will provide more methods for bone repair and bone regeneration. In the present study, human osteoblast hFOB 1.19 cells were cultured. MicroRNA-214 (miR-214) expression significantly down-regulated during the osteogenic differentiation of hFOB 1.19 cells. In addition, miR-214 overexpression by miR-214 precursor transfection markedly inhibited the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type I α1 (col1α1) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), which concomitantly decreased ALP activity and the number of mineralized nodules but promoted the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), an osteogenesis blocker. We next found that miR-214 inhibited the expression of baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 7 (BIRC7), a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family. However, BIRC7 overexpression, which was induced by plasmid transfection, notably reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-214, indicating a potential BIRC7-dependent osteogenic differentiation manner mediated by miR-214. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that miR-214 suppresses osteogenesis by targeting BIRC7, providing a possible therapeutic target for bone degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Mounting evidence indicates that methamphetamine causes blood-brain barrier damage, with emphasis on endothelial cells. The role of pericytes in methamphetamine-induced BBB damage remains unknown. Our study demonstrated that methamphetamine increased the migration of pericytes from the endothelial basement membrane. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Thus, we examined the molecular mechanisms involved in methamphetamine-induced pericyte migration. The results showed that exposure of C3H/10T1/2 cells and HBVPs to methamphetamine increased PUMA expression via activation of the sigma-1 receptor, MAPK and Akt/PI3K pathways. Moreover, methamphetamine treatment resulted in the increased migration of C3H/10T1/2 cells and HBVPs. Knockdown of PUMA in pericytes transduced with PUMA siRNA attenuated the methamphetamine-induced increase in cell migration through attenuation of integrin and tyrosine kinase mechanisms, implicating a role of PUMA in the migration of C3H/10T1/2 cells and HBVPs. This study has demonstrated that methamphetamine-mediated pericytes migration involves PUMA up-regulation. Thus, targeted studies of PUMA could provide insights to facilitate the development of a potential therapeutic approach for alleviation of methamphetamine-induced pericyte migration.

Abstract: Summary
Plants defend against pathogen attack by modulating auxin signaling and activating the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways. SA and JA act antagonistically in resistance to specific pathogen types, yet how plants coordinate these phytohormones remains elusive. Here we report that biotrophic-pathogen-induced SA accumulation dampens both auxin and JA synthesis by inhibiting CATALASE2 (CAT2) activity in the model plant Arabidopsis. SA suppression of CAT2 results in increased H2O2 levels and subsequent sulfenylation of tryptophan synthetase β subunit 1, thus depleting the auxin biosynthetic precursor tryptophan. In addition, we find that CAT2 promotes JA biosynthesis by facilitating direct interaction of the JA biosynthetic enzymes ACX2 and ACX3, and thus SA repression of CAT2 inhibits JA accumulation. As such, the cat2-1 mutant exhibits increased resistance to biotrophic pathogens and increased susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens. Our study illustrates how CAT2 coordinates SA repression of auxin accumulation and JA biosynthesis in plant defense.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is the most common type of tumor in developing countries and the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Here, we demonstrated the apoptotic effects of GL-V9 on several human gastric cancer cells and selected MGC-803 cells to uncover the underlying mechanism. GL-V9 elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, abated mitochondrial membrane potential and triggered the onset of apoptotic execution in MGC-803 cells. Our research revealed that CHOP silencing could not inhibit apoptosis, neither could it block Ca2+ release, suggesting that GL-V9-induced apoptosis was independent of CHOP. Furthermore, GL-V9 increased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor via the activation of phospholipase C-γ1 and the translocation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase from nucleus to endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, in-vivo studies indicated that GL-V9 exhibited significant MGC-803 xenografts regression in nude mice with low systemic toxicity. In conclusion, GL-V9 could induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, and would be a promising therapeutical agent against gastric cancer.

Abstract: Oxidative stress was predominantly involved in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI). Recent studies had reported the protective role of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) against oxidative stress. Hence, we investigated the levels of miR140-5p and its functional role in the pathogenesis of Cisplatin induced AKI. A mice Cisplatin induced-AKI model was established. We found that miR-140-5p expression was markedly increased in mice kidney. Bioinformatics analysis revealed nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) was a potential target of miR-140-5p, We demonstrated that miR-140-5p did not affect Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) level but directly targeted the 3′-UTR of Nrf2 mRNA and played a positive role in the regulation of Nrf2 expression which was confirmed by luciferase activity assay and western blot. What was more, consistent with miR140-5p expression, the mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2, as well as antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven genes Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase l (NQO1) were significantly increased in mice kidney tissues. In vitro study, Enforced expression of miR-140-5p in HK2 cells significantly attenuated oxidative stress by decreasing ROS level and increasing the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Simultaneously, miR-140-5p decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and improved cell vitality in HK2 cells under Cisplatin-induced oxidative stress. However, HK2 cells transfected with a siRNA targeting Nrf2 abrogated the protective effects of miR-140-5p against oxidative stress. These results indicated that miR-140-5p might exert its anti-oxidative stress function via targeting Nrf2. Our findings showed the novel transcriptional role of miR140-5p in the expression of Nrf2 and miR-140-5p protected against Cisplatin induced oxidative stress by activating Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway, providing a potentially therapeutic target in acute kidney injury.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental estrogens and anti-hormone therapies for breast cancer have diverse tissue- and signaling-pathway-selective outcomes, but how estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) mediates this phenotypic diversity is poorly understood. We implemented a statistical approach to allow unbiased, parallel analyses of multiple crystal structures, and identified subtle perturbations of ERα structure by different synthetic and environmental estrogens. Many of these perturbations were in the sub-Å range, within the noise of the individual structures, but contributed significantly to the activities of synthetic and environmental estrogens. Combining structural perturbation data from many structures with quantitative cellular activity profiles of the ligands enabled identification of structural rules for ligand-specific allosteric signaling—predicting activity from structure. This approach provides a framework for understanding the diverse effects of environmental estrogens and for guiding iterative medicinal chemistry efforts to generate improved breast cancer therapies, an approach that can be applied to understanding other ligand-regulated allosteric signaling pathways.

Abstract: Infiltrating macrophages in tumor microenvironment, through their secreted cytokines and growth factors, regulate several processes of cancer progression such as cancer cell survival, proliferation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Recently, intercellular cytoplasmic bridges between cancer cells referred as tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) have been recognized as novel mode of intercellular communication between cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of inflammatory mediators present in conditioned medium derived from macrophages on the formation of TNTs in breast adenocarcinoma cells MCF-7. Results show that treatment with macrophage conditioned medium (MɸCM) not only enhanced TNT formation between cells but also stimulated the release of independently migrating viable cytoplasmic fragments, referred to as microplasts, from MCF-7 cells. Time lapse microscopy revealed that microplasts were released from parent cancer cells in extracellular space through formation of TNT-like structures. Mitochondria, vesicles and cytoplasm could be transferred from parent cell body to microplasts through connecting TNTs. The microplasts could also be resorbed into the parent cell body by retraction of the connecting TNTs. Microplast formation inhibited in presence cell migration inhibitor, cytochalasin-B. Notably by utilizing migratory machinery within microplasts, distantly located MCF-7 cells formed several TNT based intercellular connections, leading to formation of physically connected network of cells. Together, these results demonstrate novel role of TNTs in microplast formation, novel modes of TNT formation mediated by microplasts and stimulatory effect of MɸCM on cellular network formation in MCF-7 cells mediated through enhanced TNT and microplast formation.

Abstract: Despite continued improvement in conventional therapy, pancreatic cancer continues to be one of the deadliest tumors worldwide with abysmal 5-year survival rate. New immunotherapeutic strategies that aim at improving antitumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses are being developed in solid tumors. To assist the development of immunotherapies, we investigated the CD8+ T cells in pancreatic cancer patients. Compared to healthy individuals, pancreatic cancer patients presented a significant enrichment in the frequency of CD8+CXCR5+ T cells. In the tumor microenvironment, the frequencies of CD8+CXCR5+ T cells were further increased. In most cases, over half of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were CD8+CXCR5+ T cells. Compared to the circulating population, the tumor-infiltrating CD8+CXCR5+ T cells expressed higher levels of PD-1 and TIM-3. Functional analyses demonstrated that upon CD3/CD28 activation, the percentages of TNF-expressing and IFN-γ-expressing cells in CD8+CXCR5+ T cells were significantly higher than that in CD8+CXCR5- T cells. CD8+CXCR5+ T cells also presented enhanced cytotoxicity than CD8+CXCR5- T cells. Upon PD-1 and TIM-3 blockade, the functions of CD8+CXCR5+ T cells were further improved. The disease-free survival of pancreatic cancer patients following tumor resection was positively correlated with the frequencies of circulating and tumor-infiltrating CD8+CXCR5+ T cells. Together, our study identified that CD8+CXCR5+ T cells were a potent subset of CD8+ T cells that were highly enriched in pancreatic cancer patients and could respond to anti-PD-1/anti-TIM-3 blockade by further upregulation in function.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine acetylation is becoming increasingly recognized as a general biological principle in cellular homeostasis, and is subject to abnormal control in different human pathologies. Here, we describe a global effect on amyloid-like protein aggregation in human cells that results from aberrant lysine acetylation. Bromodomain reader proteins are involved in the aggregation process and, using chemical biology and gene silencing, we establish that p300/CBP bromodomains are necessary for aggregation to occur. Moreover, protein aggregation disturbs proteostasis by impairing the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and protein translation, resulting in decreased cell viability. p300/CBP bromodomain inhibitors impede aggregation, which coincides with enhanced UPS function and increased cell viability. Aggregation of a pathologically relevant form of huntingtin protein is similarly affected by p300/CBP inhibition. Our results have implications for understanding the molecular basis of protein aggregation, and highlight the possibility of treating amyloid-like pathologies and related protein folding diseases with bromodomain inhibitor-based strategies.

Abstract: Diverse cellular functions require the establishment of cell polarity. Although the morphological manifestation of cell polarity can be complex, common principles and conserved regulatory pathways can be studied leveraging the powerful genetic tools in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A vast array of genetic and cell biological tools and interdisciplinary approaches have been employed to understand the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in budding yeast. These tools enabled the identification of key molecular components, their mechanisms of action, and the pathway governing the spatiotemporal properties of cell polarity. In this review, we describe a set of useful methods with special focus on the combination of genetic manipulation and quantitative live-cell imaging, as well as advanced microscopy-based quantitative analysis, for studying symmetry-breaking process in budding yeast. Specific examples are included to illustrate the utilities of each method.

Abstract: The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult mammalian brain hosts full potential neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs are able to respond to extracellular signals in the brain, amplifying the pool of progenitor cells and giving rise to neuroblasts that show ability to migrate towards an injury site. These signals can come from vascular system, cerebrospinal fluid, glial cells, or projections of neurons in adjoining regions. CXCL12, a chemokine secreted after brain injury, reaches the SVZ in a gradient manner and drives neuroblasts towards the lesion area. Among many other molecules, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP-2/9) are also released during brain injury. MMP-2/9 can cleave CXCL12 generating a new molecule, CXCL12(5-67), and its effects on NSCs viability is not well described. Here we produced recombinant CXCL12 and CXCL12(5-67) and evaluated their effect in murine adult NSCs migration and survival in vitro. We showed CXCL12(5-67) does not promote NSCs migration, but does induce cell death. The NSC death induced by CXCL12(5-67) involves caspases 9 and 3/7 activation, implying the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in this phenomenon. Our evidences in vitro make CXCL12(5-67) and its receptor potential candidates for brain injuries and neurodegeneration studies.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies using defined transcription factors to convert skin fibroblasts into chondrocytes have raised the question of whether osteo-chondroprogenitors expressing SOX9 and RUNX2 could also be generated during the course of the reprogramming process. Here, we demonstrated that doxycycline-inducible expression of reprogramming factors (KLF4 [K] and c-MYC [M]) for 6 days were sufficient to convert murine fibroblasts into SOX9+/RUNX2+ cellular aggregates and together with SOX9 (S) promoted the conversion efficiency when cultured in a defined stem cell medium, mTeSR. KMS-reprogrammed cells possess gene expression profiles akin to those of native osteo-chondroprogenitors with elevated osteogenic properties and can differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes in vitro, but form bone tissue upon transplantation under the skin and in the fracture site of mouse tibia. Altogether, we provide a reprogramming strategy to enable efficient derivation of osteo-chondrogenic cells that may hold promise for cell replacement therapy not limited to cartilage but also for bone tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Leydig cells (LCs) play crucial roles in producing testosterone, and their dysfunction leads to male hypogonadism. LC transplantation is a promising alternative therapy for male hypogonadism. However, the source of LCs limits this strategy for clinical applications. Here, we report our success in reprogramming mice fibroblasts into LCs by expressing three transcriptional factors, Dmrt1, Gata4, and Nr5a1. The induced Leydig-like cells (iLCs) expressed steroidogenic genes, had a global gene expression profile similar to that of adult LCs, and acquired androgen synthesis capabilities. When iLCs were transplanted into rats or mice testes that were selectively depleted of endogenous LCs, the transplanted cells could survive and function in the interstitium of testis, resulting in the restoration of normal levels of serum testosterone. These findings demonstrate that the fibroblasts were able to be directly converted into iLCs by few defined factors, which may facilitate future applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Promoting neurogenesis is a promising strategy for the treatment of cognition impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ganoderma lucidum is a revered medicinal mushroom for health-promoting benefits in the Orient. Here, we found that oral administration of the polysaccharides and water extract from G. lucidum promoted neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation to enhance neurogenesis and alleviated cognitive deficits in transgenic AD mice. G. lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) also promoted self-renewal of NPC in cell culture. Further mechanistic study revealed that GLP potentiated activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT cascades. Consistently, inhibition of FGFR1 effectively blocked the GLP-promoted NPC proliferation and activation of the downstream cascades. Our findings suggest that GLP could serve as a regenerative therapeutic agent for the treatment of cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Claudins participate in tissue barrier function. The loss of this barrier is associated to metalloproteases-related extracellular matrix and basal membranes degradation. Claudin-1 is a pro-MMP-2 activator and claudin-6 transfected AGS (AGS-Cld6) cells are highly invasive. Our aim was to determine if claudin-6 was direct or indirectly associated with MMP-2 activation and cell invasiveness. Cytofluorometry, cell fractioning, immunoprecipitation, gelatin-zymography, cell migration and invasiveness assays were performed, claudin-2, -6, -7 and -9 transfected AGS cells, anti-MMP-2, -9 and -14, anti-claudins specific antibodies and claudin-1 small interfering RNA were used. The results showed a significant (p<0.001) overexpression of claudin-1 in AGS-Cld6 cell membranes. A strong MMP-2 activity was identified in culture supernatants of AGS-Cld6. Claudin-1 co-localized with MMP-2 and MMP-14; interestingly a significant increase in cell membrane and cytosol MMP-14 expression was detected in AGS-Cld6 cells (p<0.05). Silencing of claudin-1 in AGS-Cld6 cells showed a 60% MMP-2 activity decrease in culture supernatants and a significant decrease (p<0.05) in cell migration and invasiveness. Our results suggest that claudin-6 induces MMP-2 activation through claudin-1 membrane expression, which in turn promotes cell migration and invasiveness.

Abstract: Survivin, as an anti-apoptotic protein and a cell cycle regulator, is recently gaining importance for its regenerative potential in salvaging injured hypoxic cells of vital organs such as heart. Different strategies are being employed to upregulate survivin expression in dying hypoxic cardiomyocytes. We investigated the cardioprotective potential of a cell permeable survivin mutant protein SurR9C84A, for the management of hypoxia mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, in a novel and clinically relevant model employing primary human cardiomyocytes (HCM). The aim of this research work was to study the efficacy and mechanism of SurR9C84A facilitated cardioprotection and regeneration in hypoxic HCM. To mimic hypoxic microenvironment in vitro, well characterized HCM were treated with 100µm (48h) cobalt chloride to induce hypoxia. Hypoxia induced (HI) HCM were further treated with SurR9C84A (1µg/mL) in order to analyse its cardioprotective efficacy. Confocal microscopy showed rapid internalization of SurR9C84A and scanning electron microscopy revealed the reinstatement of cytoskeleton projections in HI HCM. SurR9C84A treatment increased cell viability, reduced cell death via, apoptosis (Annexin-V assay), and downregulated free cardiac troponin T and MMP-9 expression. SurR9C84A also upregulated the expression of proliferation markers (PCNA and Ki-67) and downregulated mitochondrial depolarization and ROS levels thereby, impeding cell death. Human Apoptosis Array further revealed that SurR9C84A downregulated expression of pro-apoptotic markers and augmented expression of HSPs and HTRA2/Omi. SurR9C84A treatment led to enhanced levels of survivin, VEGF, PI3K and pAkt. SurR9C84A proved non-toxic to normoxic HCM, as validated through unaltered cell proliferation and other marker levels. Its pre-treatment exhibited lesser susceptibility to hypoxia/damage. SurR9C84A holds a promising clinical potential for human cardiomyocyte survival and proliferation following hypoxic injury.

Abstract: Summary
There is an increasing appreciation for structural diversity of DNA that is of interest to both DNA nanotechnology and basic biology. Here, we have explored how DNA responds to torsional stress by building on a previously reported two-turn DNA tensegrity triangle and demonstrating that we could introduce an extra nucleotide pair (np) into the original sequence without affecting assembly and crystallization. The extra np imposes a significant torsional stress, which is accommodated by global changes throughout the B-DNA duplex and the DNA lattice. The work reveals a near-atomic structure of naked DNA under a torsional stress of approximately 14%, and thus provides an example of DNA distortions that occur without a requirement for either an external energy source or the free energy available from protein or drug binding.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells have been proposed as an unlimited source of pancreatic β cells for studying and treating diabetes. However, the long, multi-step differentiation protocols used to generate functional β cells inevitably exhibit considerable variability, particularly when applied to pluripotent cells from diverse genetic backgrounds. We have developed culture conditions that support long-term self-renewal of human multipotent pancreatic progenitors, which are developmentally more proximal to the specialized cells of the adult pancreas. These cultured pancreatic progenitor (cPP) cells express key pancreatic transcription factors, including PDX1 and SOX9, and exhibit transcriptomes closely related to their in vivo counterparts. Upon exposure to differentiation cues, cPP cells give rise to pancreatic endocrine, acinar, and ductal lineages, indicating multilineage potency. Furthermore, cPP cells generate insulin+ β-like cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that they offer a convenient alternative to pluripotent cells as a source of adult cell types for modeling pancreatic development and diabetes.

Eicosapentaenoic acid ameliorates palmitate-induced lipotoxicity via the AMP kinase/dynamin-related protein-1 signaling pathway in differentiated H9c2 myocytes,

Abstract: Background
Emerging evidence suggested the preferable effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) against cardiac lipotoxicity, which worsens cardiac function by means of excessive serum free fatty acids due to chronic adrenergic stimulation under heart failure. Nonetheless, the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we focused on dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) as a possible modulator of the EPA-mediated cardiac protection against cardiac lipotoxicity, and investigated the causal relation between AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Drp1.
Methods and results
When differentiated H9c2 myocytes were exposed to palmitate (PAL; saturated fatty acid, 400µM) for 24h, these myocytes showed activation of caspases 3 and 7, enhanced caspase 3 cleavage, depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, depleted intracellular ATP, and enhanced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. These changes suggested lipotoxicity due to excessive PAL. PAL enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation with increased Drp1 expression, as well. EPA (50µM) restored the PAL-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial fragmentation with increased Drp1 expression by PAL. EPA activated phosphorylation of AMPK, and pharmacological activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide ameliorated the PAL-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and downregulated Drp1. An AMPK knockdown via RNA interference enhanced Drp1 expression and attenuated the protective effects of EPA against the PAL-induced lipotoxicity.
Conclusion
EPA ameliorates the PAL-induced lipotoxicity via AMPK activation, which subsequently suppresses mitochondrial fragmentation and Drp1 expression. Our findings may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of EPA-mediated myocardial protection in heart failure.

Abstract: Genomic information has become a ubiquitous and almost essential aspect of biological research. Over the last 10–15 years, the cost of generating sequence data from DNA or RNA samples has dramatically declined and our ability to interpret those data increased just as remarkably. Although it is still possible for biologists to conduct interesting and valuable research on species for which genomic data are not available, the impact of having access to a high quality whole genome reference assembly for a given species is nothing short of transformational. Research on a species for which we have no DNA or RNA sequence data is restricted in fundamental ways. In contrast, even access to an initial draft quality genome (see below for definitions) opens a wide range of opportunities that are simply not available without that reference genome assembly. Although a complete discussion of the impact of genome sequencing and assembly is beyond the scope of this short paper, the goal of this review is to summarize the most common and highest impact contributions that whole genome sequencing and assembly has had on comparative and evolutionary biology.

Abstract: Summary
CD8+ T cells may play a dual role in protection against and pathogenesis of flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV). We evaluated the CD8+ T cell response in ZIKV-infected LysMCre+IFNARfl/fl C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice lacking the type I interferon receptor in a subset of myeloid cells. In total, 26 and 15 CD8+ T cell-reactive peptides for ZIKV African (MR766) and Asian (FSS13025) lineage strains, respectively, were identified and validated. CD8+ T cells from infected mice were polyfunctional and mediated cytotoxicity. Adoptive transfer of ZIKV-immune CD8+ T cells reduced viral burdens, whereas their depletion led to higher tissue burdens, and CD8−/− mice displayed higher mortality with ZIKV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CD8+ T cells protect against ZIKV infection. Further, this study provides a T cell competent mouse model for investigating ZIKV-specific T cell responses.

Abstract: Objective
The aim of this study was to demonstrate that altered gene expression of Smad7regulated NF-κB expression and ROS production on Ang II (Angiotensin II)-induced rat glomerular mesangial cell (GMC) proliferation.
Methods
pAdTrack-CMV-Smad7 was transduced into rat GMC by adeno-transduction using an ADV (adenovirus)-mediated vector in vivo. Diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI) pre-treated GMC, and blocked ROS generation as determined by DCFH-DA method. Altered expressions of IκBα and p65 were monitored by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. GMC proliferation was tested by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Apoptosis of GMC was detected by flow cytometric analysis.
Results
Over-expression of Smad7 dampened the ability of Ang II to promote ROS synthesis and inhibited the ability of Ang II to decrease functional expression of IκBα. Moreover, Smad7 increased nuclear IκBα expression. Smad7 did not significantly influence the capacity of Ang II to increase protein expression of NF-κB p65. However, immunofluorescence analysis showed that Smad7 reduced nuclear NF-κB p65 level. Further, over-expression of Smad7 promoted GMC apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB activation, which alleviated the Ang II-promoted proliferation of GMC.
Conclusions
Smad7 influenced NF-κB expression by regulating ROS generation, and induced GMC apoptosis to counter the Ang II-promoted proliferation.

Abstract: Background
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is currently incurable despite many novel therapies. Tumour Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is a potential anti-tumour agent although effects as a single agent are limited. In this study, we investigated whether the Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA can enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis and target TRAIL resistance in both suspension culture, and 3D cell culture as a model of disseminated MM lesions that form in bone.
Methods
The effects of SAHA and/or TRAIL in 6 Multiple Myeloma cell lines were assessed in both suspension cultures and in an Alginate-based 3D cell culture model. The effect of SAHA and/or TRAIL was assessed on apoptosis by assessment of nuclear morphology using Hoechst 33342/Propidium Iodide staining. Viable cell number was assessed by CellTiter-Glo luminescence assay, Caspase-8 and -9 activities were measured by Caspase-Glo™ assay kit. TRAIL-resistant cells were generated by culture of RPMI 8226 and NCI-H929 by acute exposure to TRAIL followed by selection of TRAIL-resistant cells.
Results
TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in OPM-2, RPMI 8226, NCI-H929, U266, JJN-3 MM cell lines and ADC-1 plasma cell leukaemia cells. SAHA amplified TRAIL responses in all lines except OPM-2, and enhanced TRAIL responses were both via Caspase-8 and -9. SAHA treatment induced growth inhibition that further increased in the combination treatment with TRAIL in MM cells. The co-treatment of TRAIL and SAHA reduced viable cell numbers all cell lines. TRAIL responses were further potentiated by SAHA in 3D cell culture in NCI-H929, RPMI 8226 and U266 at lower TRAIL + SAHA doses than in suspension culture. However TRAIL responses in cells that had been selected for TRAIL resistance were not further enhanced by SAHA treatment.
Conclusions
SAHA is a potent sensitizer of TRAIL responses in both TRAIL sensitive and resistant cell lines, in both suspension and 3D culture, however SAHA did not sensitise TRAIL-sensitive cell populations that had been selected for TRAIL-resistance from initially TRAIL-sensitive populations. SAHA may increase TRAIL sensitivity in insensitive cells, but not in cells that have specifically been selected for acquired TRAIL-resistance.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs), molecular chaperones, are crucial for the cancer cells to facilitate proper functioning of various oncoproteins involved in cell survival, proliferation, migration, and tumor angiogenesis. Tumor cells are said to be “addicted” to HSPs. HSPs are overexpressed in many cancers due to upregulation of transcription factor Heat-shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the multifaceted master regulator of heat shock response. Therefore, pharmacological targeting of HSPs via HSF-1 is an effective strategy to treat malignant cancers like triple negative breast cancer. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a pyrrole derivative [bis(2-ethylhexyl)1H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarboxylate], TCCP, purified from leaves of Tinospora cordifolia for its ability to suppress heat shock response and angiogenesis using MDA-MB-231 cells and the murine mammary carcinoma: Ehrlich ascites tumor model. HSP90 was downregulated by TCCP by inactivation of HSF-1 resulting in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, VEGF-induced cell migration, and concomitant decrease in tumor burden and neo-angiogenesis in vivo. The mechanism of suppression of HSPs involves inactivation of PI3K/Akt and phosphorylation on serine 307 of HSF-1 by the activation of ERK1. HSF-1 and HSP90 and 70 localization and expression were ascertained by immunolocalization, immunoblotting, and qPCR experiments. The anti-angiogenic effect of TCCP was studied in vivo in tumor-bearing mice and ex vivo using rat corneal micro-pocket assay. All the results thus corroborate the logic behind inactivating HSF-1 using TCCP as an alternative approach for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) provide an unlimited source of donor cells for potential cardiac regenerative therapies. However, hPSC-CMs are immature. For instance, hPSC-CMs are only 1/10 of the physical size of their adult counterparts; the majority are mono- rather than bi- or multi-nucleated, which is an evolutionary adaptive feature in metabolically active cells such as adult CMs. Here, we attempted to increase the physical size and nucleation status of hPSC-derived ventricular (V) cardiomyocytes (hPSC-VCMs) using chemically-induced cell fusion, and examined the subsequent functional effects. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was employed to fuse a 1:1 mixture of lentiviral vectors LV-MLC2v-GFP- or –tdTomato-labeled hPSC-VCMs, such that hPSC-VCMs fused syncytia (FS) were identified as doubly GFP+/tdTomato+ multi-nucleated cells. These microscopically-identified FS were doubled in size as gauged by their capacitance when compared to the control mononucleated hPSC-VCMs using patch-clamp analysis. Reduced automaticity or action potential (AP) firing rate and moderately prolonged AP duration were observed in FS from day 6 post-fusion induction. However, Ca2+ handling, mitochondrial biogenesis and the extent of apoptosis were not significantly altered. We conclude that larger, multi-nucleated hPSC-VCMs FS can be created by chemically-induced cell fusion but global maturation requires additional triggering cues.

Abstract: Summary
Cell ablation is a strategy to study cell lineage and function during development. Optogenetic methods are an important cell-ablation approach, and we have previously developed a mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) tool that works in the living Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we use directed evolution to generate miniSOG2, an improved tool for cell ablation via photogenerated reactive oxygen species. We apply miniSOG2 to a far more complex model animal system, Drosophila melanogaster, and demonstrate that it can be used to kill a single neuron in a Drosophila larva. In addition, miniSOG2 is able to photoablate a small group of cells in one of the larval wing imaginal discs, resulting in an adult with one incomplete and one normal wing. We expect miniSOG2 to be a useful optogenetic tool for precision cell ablation at a desired developmental time point in live animals, thus opening a new window into cell origin, fate and function, tissue regeneration, and developmental biology.

Abstract: Foxc1 and Foxc2 (Foxc1/2) are transcription factors involved in many biological processes. In adult kidneys, expression of Foxc1/2 is confined to the glomerular epithelial cells, i.e., podocytes. To bypass embryonic lethality of Foxc1/2 null mice, mice ubiquitously expressing inducible-Cre (ROSA26-CreERT2) or mice expressing Cre in podocytes (Nephrin-Cre) were mated with floxed-Foxc1 and floxed-Foxc2 mice. The CreERT2 was activated in adult mice by administrations of tamoxifen. Eight weeks after tamoxifen treatment, ROSA26-CreERT2; Foxc1+/flox; Foxc2flox/flox mice developed microalbuminuria, while ROSA26-Cre ERT2; Foxc1flox/flox; Foxc2+/flox mice had no microalbuminuria. The kidneys of conditional-Foxc1/2 null mice showed proteinaceous casts, protein reabsorption droplets in tubules and huge vacuoles in podocytes, indicating severe podocyte injury and massive proteinuria. Comparison of gene expression profiles revealed that Foxc1/2 maintain expression of genes necessary for podocyte function such as podocin and Cxcl12. In addition, mice with an innate podocyte-specific deletion of Foxc1/2 by Nephrin-Cre develop similar podocyte injury. These results demonstrate dose-dependence of Foxc1/2 gene in maintaining the podocyte with a more critical role for Foxc2 than Foxc1 and a critical role of Foxc1/2 in regulating expression of genes that maintain podocyte integrity.

Abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been used extensively to study neuroinflammation, but usually its effects were examined acutely (24h<). We have shown previously that a single intraperitoneal LPS injection activated satellite glial cells (SGCs) in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and altered several functional parameters in these cells for at least one week. Here we asked whether the LPS effects would persist for 1 month. We injected mice with a single LPS dose and tested pain behavior, assessed SGCs activation in DRG using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining, and injected a fluorescent dye intracellularly to study intercellular coupling. Electron microscopy was used to quantitate changes in gap junctions. We found that at 30 days post-LPS the threshold to mechanical stimulation was lower than in controls. GFAP expression, as well as the magnitude of dye coupling among SGCs were greater than in controls. Electron microscopy analysis supported these results, showing a greater number of gap junctions and an abnormal growth of SGC processes. These changes were significant, but less prominent than at 7 days post-LPS. We conclude that a single LPS injection exerts long-term behavioral and cellular changes. The results are consistent with the idea that SGC activation contributes to hyperalgesia.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are maintained in serum with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency. Recently, a 2i culture method was reported using a combination of MEK inhibition (MEKi) and GSK3 inhibition (GSK3i) with LIF to maintain ESCs in a naive ground state. How 2i maintains a ground state of ESCs remains elusive. Here we show that MEKi and GSK3i maintain the ESC ground state by downregulating global DNA methylation through two distinct mechanisms. MEK1 phosphorylates JMJD2C for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Therefore, MEKi increased JMJD2C protein levels but decreased DNMT3 expression. JMJD2C promotes TET1 activity to increase 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels. GSK3i suppressed DNMT3 expression, thereby decreasing DNA methylation without affecting 5hmC levels. Furthermore, 2i increased PRDM14 expression to inhibit DNMT3A/B protein expression by promoting G9a-mediated DNMT3A/B protein degradation. Collectively, 2i allows ESCs to maintain a naive ground state through JMJD2C-dependent TET1 activation and PRDM14/G9a-mediated DNMT3A/B protein degradation.

Abstract: Objectives
Autophagy constitutes a defense mechanism to overcome aging and apoptosis in osteoarthritic cartilage. Several cytokines and transcription factors are linked to autophagy and play an important role in the degradative cascade in osteoarthritis (OA). Cell therapy such as platelet rich plasma (PRP) has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic tool for many diseases including OA. However, its mechanism of action on improving cartilage repair remains to be determined. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of PRP on osteoarthritic chondrocytes and to elucidate the mechanism by which PRP contributes to cartilage regeneration.
Methods
Osteoarthritic chondrocytes were co-cultured with an increasing concentration of PRP obtained from healthy donors. The effect of PRP on the proliferation of chondrocytes was performed using cell counting and WST8 proliferation assays. Autophagy, apoptosis and intracellular level of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were determined using flow cytometry analyses. Autophagy markers BECLIN and LC3II were also determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR and ELISA were used to measure the expression of ADAMDTS-5, MMP3, MMP13, TIMP-1–2–3, aggregan, Collagen type 2, TGF-β, Cox-2, Il-6, FOXO1, FOXO3, and HIF-1 in tissues and co-cultured media.
Results
PRP increased significantly the proliferation of chondrocytes, decreased apoptosis and increased autophagy and its markers along with its regulators FOXO1, FOXO3 and HIF-1 in osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Furthermore, PRP caused a dose-dependent significant decrease in MMP3, MMP13, and ADAMTS-5, IL-6 and COX-2 while increasing TGF-β, aggregan, and collagen type 2, TIMPs and intracellular IL-4, IL-10, IL-13.
Conclusion
These results suggest that PRP could be a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of OA.

Abstract: Summary
Insects develop efficient antimicrobial strategies to flourish in a bacterial world. It has long been proposed that native gut microbiota is an important component of host defense; however, the responsible species have rarely been isolated to elucidate the mechanism of action. Here we show that the dominant symbiotic bacterium Enterococcus mundtii associated with the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis actively secretes a stable class IIa bacteriocin (mundticin KS) against invading bacteria, but not against other gut residents, facilitating the normal development of host gut microbiota. A mundticin-defective strain lost inhibitory activity. Furthermore, purified mundticin cures infected larvae. Thus, the constitutively produced antimicrobials by native extracellular symbionts create a significant chemical barrier inside limiting invader expansion. This unique property also benefits E. mundtii itself by providing a competitive advantage, contributing to its dominance within complex microbial settings and its prevalence across Lepidoptera, and probably promotes the long-term cooperative symbiosis between both parties.

Abstract: As a potentially unlimited autologous cell source, patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide great capability for tissue regeneration, particularly in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, despite significant progress made in translation of iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to clinical settings, a few hurdles remain. Among them, non-invasive approach to obtain source cells in a timely manner, safer integration-free delivery of reprogramming factors, and purification of NPCs before transplantation are top priorities to overcome. In this study, we developed a safe and cost-effective pipeline to generate clinically relevant NPCs. We first isolated cells from patients' urine and reprogrammed them into iPSCs by non-integrating Sendai viral vectors, and carried out experiments on neural differentiation. NPCs were purified by A2B5, an antibody specifically recognizing a glycoganglioside on the cell surface of neural lineage cells, via fluorescence activated cell sorting. Upon further in vitro induction, NPCs were able to give rise to neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. To test the functionality of the A2B5+ NPCs, we grafted them into the contused mouse thoracic spinal cord. Eight weeks after transplantation, the grafted cells survived, integrated into the injured spinal cord, and differentiated into neurons and glia. Our specific focus on cell source, reprogramming, differentiation and purification method purposely addresses timing and safety issues of transplantation to SCI models. It is our belief that this work takes one step closer on using human iPSC derivatives to SCI clinical settings.

Abstract: Endocytosis is a complex and dynamic process that involves dozens of different proteins to define the site of endocytosis, form a membrane invagination, and pinch off a membrane vesicle into the cytoplasm. Fluorescent light microscopy is a powerful tool to visualize the dynamic behaviors of the proteins taking part in the endocytic process. The resolution of light microscopy is, however, a serious limitation. Here, we detail a fluorescence microscope method that we have developed to visualize the dynamics of the clathrin-mediated endocytic protein machinery in yeast cells. This method is based on subpixel centroid tracking of endocytic proteins. For each endocytic protein, the centroid trajectories obtained from multiple endocytic events are used to compute an average trajectory that describes, at nanometer scale, the assembly and movement of the protein during endocytosis. The average trajectories of the different endocytic proteins are then aligned together in space and time to reconstruct how the different proteins behave relative to each other during the endocytic process.
