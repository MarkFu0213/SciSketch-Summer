Abstract: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome, is a rare, lysosomal disorder caused by mutations in a gene encoding iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS). IDS deficiency results in an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and secondary accumulations of other lipids in lysosomes. Symptoms of MPS II include a variety of soft and hard tissue problems, developmental delay, and deterioration of multiple organs. Enzyme replacement therapy is an approved treatment for MPS II, but fails to improve neuronal symptoms. Cell-based neuronal models of MPS II disease are needed for compound screening and drug development for the treatment of the neuronal symptoms in MPS II. In this study, three induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines were generated from three MPS II patient-derived dermal fibroblast cell lines that were differentiated into neural stem cells and neurons. The disease phenotypes were measured using immunofluorescence staining and Nile red dye staining. In addition, the therapeutic effects of recombinant human IDS enzyme, delta-tocopherol (DT), and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) were determined in the MPS II disease cells. Finally, the neural stem cells from two of the MPS II iPSC lines exhibited typical disease features including a deficiency of IDS activity, abnormal glycosaminoglycan storage, and secondary lipid accumulation. Enzyme replacement therapy partially rescued the disease phenotypes in these cells. DT showed a significant effect in reducing the secondary accumulation of lipids in the MPS II neural stem cells. In contrast, HPBCD displayed limited or no effect in these cells. Our data indicate that these MPS II cells can be used as a cell-based disease model to study disease pathogenesis, evaluate drug efficacy, and screen compounds for drug development.

Abstract: The retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE) are sensitive to oxidative stimuli due to long-term exposure to various environmental stimuli. Thus, the oxidative injury of RPE cells caused by the imbalance of redox homeostasis is one of the main pathogenic factors of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). But the sophisticated mechanisms linking AMD to oxidative stress are not fully elucidated. Activation of Nrf2 signal pathway can protect RPE cells from oxidative damage. The present study investigated the regulating mechanism of miR-125b in Nrf2 cascade and evaluated its antioxidant capacity. The in vitro studies indicated that overexpression of miR-125b substantially inhibited Keap1 expression, enhanced Nrf2 expression and induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Importantly, functional studies demonstrated that forced expression of miR-125b could significantly elevate cell proliferation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels while reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. Further studies showed that miR-125b had no effect when Nrf2 was silenced in ARPE-19 cells. Additionally, the results identified that Nrf2 silence induced ROS accumulation enhances HIF-1α protein expression, while miR-125b could offset this effect via promoting HIF-1α protein degradation. Subsequent in vivo studies demonstrated that sodium iodate induced outer retina thinner was reversed with exogenous supplementation of miR-125b, which was cancelled in Nrf2 knockout mice. In conclusion, this study illustrated that miR-125b can protect RPE from oxidative damage via targeting Nrf2/HIF-1α signal pathway and potentially may serve as a therapeutic agent of AMD.

Abstract: Diabetes is a prevalent disease worldwide that can result in several complications, including renal failure, blindness, and amputation. Diabetic foot ulcers, which have the characteristics of chronic wounds, are a devastating component of diabetes progression that can lead to lower extremity amputation. In this study, we set out to investigate the mechanisms involved in wound healing of diabetic foot ulcers. The expression of USP30 in skin tissues of patients with diabetic foot ulcers and HSF2 human skin fibroblasts treated with advanced glycation end (AGE) products was detected by qRT-PCR, and CCK-8, cell scratch and ELISA assay were used to detect cell viability, migration and levels of Col I, Col III, MMP-2, MMP-9, IL-1β and IL-18. The interaction between USP30 and NLRP3 was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays. The expression of USP30, NLRP3 and caspase-1 p20 was detected by Western blot. USP30 inhibitor MF-094 was used to treat diabetic rat model established by streptozotocin (STZ). We found that USP30, a deubiquitinase, was upregulated in skin tissues of patients with diabetic foot ulcers compared with normal skin tissues. In vitro, we found that treatment of HSF2 human skin fibroblasts with advanced glycation end (AGE) products, known to contribute to diabetic complications, resulted in suppressed viability and migration of HSF2 cells, as well as increased levels of USP30 mRNA and protein. Functionally, downregulation of USP30 via shRNA-mediated knockdown or treatment with the USP30 inhibitor MF-094, restored viability and migration of AGE-treated HSF2 cells. We identified the NLRP3 inflammasome as a critical target of USP30 in AGE-induced functions. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that USP30 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by deubiquitinating NLRP3. Finally, we show that inhibition of USP30 via MF-094 treatment facilitated wound healing in diabetic rats and resulted in decreased protein levels of NLRP3 and its downstream target caspase-1 p20, thus establishing the physiological importance of the identified USP30-NLRP3 link. Together, our findings suggest a therapeutic potential for USP30 in diabetic foot ulcers.

Abstract: Summary
The global epidemic caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the infection of over 200 million people. To extend the knowledge of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and humans, we systematically investigate the interactome of 29 viral proteins in human cells by using an antibody-based TurboID assay. In total, 1,388 high-confidence human proximal proteins with biotinylated sites are identified. Notably, we find that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the antiviral and immune responses. We validate that the membrane protein ITGB1 associates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibit activation of the interferon pathway through the mitochondrial protein mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and the methyltransferase SET domain containing 2, histone lysine methyltransferase (SETD2). We propose 111 potential drugs for the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify three compounds that significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. The proximity labeling map of SARS-CoV-2 and humans provides a resource for elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection and developing drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

Abstract: Endoreplication, known as endocycles or endoreduplication, is a cell cycle variant in which the genomic DNA is re-replicated without mitosis leading to polyploidy. Endoreplication is essential for the development and functioning of the different organs in animals and plants. Deletion of Geminin, a DNA replication licensing inhibitor, causes DNA re-replication or damage. However, the role of Geminin in endoreplication is still unclear. Here, we studied the role of Geminin in the endoreplication of the silk gland cells of silkworms by constructing two transgenic silkworm strains, including BmGeminin1-overexpression and BmGeminin1-RNA interference. Interference of BmGeminin1 led to body weight gain, increased silk gland volume, increased DNA content, and enhanced DNA re-replication activity relative to wild-type Dazao. Meanwhile, overexpression of BmGeminin1 showed an opposite phenotype compared to the BmGem1-RNAi strain. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing of the transgenic strains was carried out to explore how BmGeminin1 regulates DNA re-replication. Our data demonstrated a vital role of Geminin in the regulation of endoreplication in the silk gland of silkworms.

Abstract: Intestinal fibrosis is one of the most severe complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and frequently requires surgery due to intestinal obstruction. Integrin αvβ6, which is mainly regulated by the integrin β6 subunit gene (ITGB6), is a special integrin subtype expressed only in epithelial cells. In our previous study, we found integrin αvβ6 can promote the development of IBD, but the role of integrin αvβ6 in intestinal fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, we observed a gradual increase of ITGB6 mRNA expression from normal region to stenotic region of IBD patients’ intestinal specimens. Next, we established a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced intestinal fibrosis model and a heterotopic intestinal transplant model, and found intestinal fibrosis was decreased in ITGB6-deficient mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, we performed RNA-sequencing and KEGG pathway analysis on intestinal tissues from ITGB6-overexpressing transgenic mice and WT mice, and found multiple pathways containing ITGB6, are related to the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK); finding was confirmed by Western blot. At last, we generated a heterotopic intestinal transplant model found the FAK/AKT pathway was inhibited in ITGB6-deficient mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that integrin αvβ6 promotes the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis by FAK/AKT pathway, making integrin αvβ6 a potential therapeutic target to prevent this condition.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting protein quality control (PQC) pathways using proteasome or p97/VCP inhibition can effectively treat blood tumors. However, in solid tumors, only p97/VCP inhibitors are effective. To probe this difference in efficacy, we tracked HCT116 colon cancer cells using temporal proteomics to define the cellular and molecular responses to proteasome and p97 inhibition. Proteins involved in general PQC pathways were similarly upregulated by both treatments, suggesting that the proteotoxic stress caused by inhibitors does not explain the differential therapeutic effectiveness. Unexpectedly, proteins specifically dysregulated by two p97 inhibitors are involved in cell cycle control. Indeed, eleven cell cycle proteins were downregulated by p97 inhibition but not by proteasome inhibition. Western blot analysis validated the degradation of cyclin D1 and Securin, which depends on proteasome but not on p97. Differing regulation of cell cycle proteins by p97 and the proteasome may, therefore, explain the therapeutic efficacy of p97 inhibitors in colon cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Layilin is a small type I transmembrane receptor thought to bridge extracellular ligands with the cytoskeleton through its intracellular interactions with the scaffolding protein talin. Recent bulk- and single-cell RNA sequencing experiments have repeatedly found layilin to be highly upregulated in key T cell sub-populations in multiple disease states, suggesting its importance to the adaptive immune response. Despite this prevalence, little is known about layilin’s precise role in mediating extracellular interactions or how these interactions can be modulated in disease states. Here we take advantage of layilin’s dependence on calcium ions to discover its interactions with highly glycosylated type II, IV, V, and VI collagens. Toward exploring layilin’s role in disease, we exploited the Ca2+ dependence in a differential phage display strategy to engineer species cross-reactive antibodies that block this interaction.

Abstract: Summary
Modeling the tumor-immune cell interactions in humanized mice is complex and limits drug development. Here, we generated easily accessible tumor models by transforming either primary skin fibroblasts or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cell lines injected in immune-deficient mice reconstituted with human autologous immune cells. Our results showed that fibroblastic, hepatic, or neural tumors were all efficiently infiltrated and partially or totally rejected by autologous immune cells in humanized mice. Characterization of tumor-immune infiltrates revealed high expression levels of the dysfunction markers Tim3 and PD-1 in T cells and an enrichment in regulatory T cells, suggesting rapid establishment of immunomodulatory phenotypes. Inhibition of PD-1 by Nivolumab in humanized mice resulted in increased immune cell infiltration and a slight decrease in tumor growth. We expect that these versatile and accessible cancer models will facilitate preclinical studies and the evaluation of autologous cancer immunotherapies across a range of different tumor cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is an emerging cancer suppression strategy. However, how to select cancer patients for treating with ferroptosis inducers remains challenging. Here, we develop photochemical activation of membrane lipid peroxidation (PALP), which uses targeted lasers to induce localized polyunsaturated fatty acyl (PUFA)-lipid peroxidation for reporting ferroptosis sensitivity in cells and tissues. PALP captured by BODIPY-C11 can be suppressed by lipophilic antioxidants and iron chelation, and is dependent on PUFA-lipid levels. Moreover, we develop PALPv2, for studying lipid peroxidation on selected membranes along the z axis in live cells using two-photon microscopes. Using PALPv1, we detect PUFA-lipids in multiple tissues, and validate a PUFA-phospholipid reduction during muscle aging as previously reported. Patterns of PALPv1 signals across multiple cancer cell types in vitro and in vivo are concordant with their ferroptosis susceptibility and PUFA-phospholipid levels. We envision that PALP will enable rapid stratification of ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer patients and facilitate PUFA-lipid research.

Abstract: Summary
In phenotypic compound discovery, conclusive identification of cellular targets and mode of action are often impaired by off-target binding. In particular, microtubules are frequently targeted in cellular assays. However, in vitro tubulin binding assays do not correctly reflect the cellular context, and conclusive high-throughput phenotypic assays monitoring tubulin binding are scarce, such that tubulin binding is rarely identified. We report that morphological profiling using the Cell Painting assay (CPA) can efficiently detect tubulin modulators in compound collections with a high throughput, including annotated reference compounds and unannotated compound classes with unrelated chemotypes and scaffolds. Small-molecule tubulin binders share similar CPA fingerprints, which enables prediction and experimental validation of microtubule-binding activity. Our findings suggest that CPA or a related morphological profiling approach will be an invaluable addition to small-molecule discovery programs in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry, enabling early identification of one of the most frequently observed off-target activities.

Abstract: Summary
Phages impose strong selection on bacteria to evolve resistance against viral predation. Bacteria can rapidly evolve phage resistance via receptor mutation or using their CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems. Acquisition of CRISPR immunity relies on the insertion of a phage-derived sequence into CRISPR arrays in the bacterial genome. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its phage DMS3vir as a model, we demonstrate that conditions that reduce bacterial growth rates, such as exposure to bacteriostatic antibiotics (which inhibit cell growth without killing), promote the evolution of CRISPR immunity. We demonstrate that this is due to slower phage development under these conditions, which provides more time for cells to acquire phage-derived sequences and mount an immune response. Our data reveal that the speed of phage development is a key determinant of the evolution of CRISPR immunity and suggest that use of bacteriostatic antibiotics can trigger elevated levels of CRISPR immunity in human-associated and natural environments.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers opportunities to study gene expression of tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously, to investigate cell-to-cell variation, and to reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks. Recovering dropout events in a sparse gene expression matrix for scRNA-seq data is a long-standing matrix completion problem. In this article, we introduce Bfimpute, a Bayesian factorization imputation algorithm that reconstructs two latent gene and cell matrices to impute the final gene expression matrix within each cell group, with or without the aid of cell type labels or bulk data. Bfimpute achieves better accuracy than ten other publicly notable scRNA-seq imputation methods on simulated and real scRNA-seq data, as measured by several different evaluation metrics. Bfimpute can also flexibly integrate any gene- or cell-related information that users provide to increase performance.

Abstract: Summary
Strategies to both monitor and block bacterial quorum sensing (QS), and thus associated infections, are of significant interest. We developed a straightforward assay to monitor biosurfactants and lytic agents produced by bacteria under the control of QS. The method is based on the lysis of synthetic lipid vesicles containing the environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye calcein. This assay allows for the in situ screening of compounds capable of altering biosurfactant production by bacteria, and thereby the identification of molecules that could potentially modulate QS pathways, and avoids the constraints of many of the cell-based assays in use today. Application of this assay in a high-throughput format revealed five molecules capable of blocking vesicle lysis by S. aureus. Two of these compounds were found to almost completely inhibit agr-based QS in S. aureus and represent the most potent small-molecule-derived QS inhibitors reported in this formidable pathogen.

Abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) often causes severe neurological dysfunction, and facilitating neurite elongation is particularly important in its treatment. Astrocytes (AS) play an important role in the central nervous system (CNS), and their high plasticity and versatility provide a feasible entry point for relevant research. Our purpose was to explore whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) from astrocytes (AS-EVs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-preactivated astrocytes (LPAS-EVs) facilitate neurite elongation, to explore the underlying mechanism, and to verify whether these EVs promote locomotor recovery in rats. We used LPS to preactivate astrocytes and cocultured them with PC12 cells to observe neurite changes, then extracted and identified AS-EVs and LPAS-EVs and the role and mechanism of these EVs in facilitating neurite elongation was examined in vivo and vitro. We demonstrated that AS-EVs and LPAS-EVs facilitated the elongation of neurites and the recovery of rats with SCI. LPAS-EVs had a stronger effect than AS-EVs, by activating the Hippo pathway, promoting monopole spindle binding protein 1 (MOB1) expression, and reducing Yes-associated protein (YAP) levels. The data also suggest a feedback regulation between MOB1 and p-YAP/YAP. In sum, AS-EVs and LPAS-EVs can play an active role in facilitating neurite elongation by activating the Hippo pathway. These findings provide a new strategy for treating SCI and other CNS-related injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Harnessing the immunomodulatory activity of cytokines is a focus of therapies targeting inflammatory disease. The interleukin (IL)-1 superfamily contains pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory members that help orchestrate the immune response in adaptive and innate immunity. Of these molecules, IL-37 has robust anti-inflammatory activity across a range of disease models through inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades downstream of tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and toll-like receptor pathways. We find that IL-37 is unstable with a poor pharmacokinetic and manufacturing profile. Here, we present the engineering of IL-37 from an unstable cytokine into an anti-inflammatory molecule with an excellent therapeutic likeness. We overcame these shortcomings through site-directed mutagenesis, the addition of a non-native disulfide bond, and the engineering of IL-37 as an Fc-fusion protein. Our results provide a platform for preclinical testing of IL-37 Fc-fusion proteins. The engineering approaches undertaken herein will apply to the conversion of similar potent yet short-acting cytokines into therapeutics.

Abstract: Glioma stem/initiating cells have been considered a major cause of tumor recurrence and therapeutic resistance. In this study, we have established a new glioma stem-like cell (GSC), named U373-GSC, from the U373 glioma cell line. The cells exhibited stemness properties, e.g., expression of stem cell markers, self-renewal activity, multi-lineage differentiating abilities, and drug resistance. Using U373-GSC and GSC-03A–a GSC clone previously established from patient tissue, we have identified a novel GSC-associated sialic acid-modified glycan commonly expressed in both cell lines. Lectin fluorescence staining showed that Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL–II)–binding alpha2,3-sialylated glycan (MAL-SG) was highly expressed in GSCs, and drastically decreased during FBS induced differentiation to glioma cells or little in the parental cells. Treatment of GSCs by MAL-II, compared with other lectins, showed that MAL-II significantly suppresses cell viability and sphere formation via induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of the GSCs. Similar effects were observed when the cells were treated with a sialyltransferase inhibitor or sialidase. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that MAL-SGs/alpha-2,3 sialylations are upregulated and control survival/maintenances of GSCs, and their functional inhibitions lead to apoptosis of GSCs. MAL-SG could be a potential marker and therapeutic target of GSCs; its inhibitors, such as MAL-II, may be useful for glioma treatment in the future.

Abstract: The RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146 is an enzyme that plays an important role in ubiquitin-proteasomal protein degradation and participates in various pathophysiological processes. However, its role in cardiac hypertrophy is unclear. In the present work, thoracic transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was performed in transgenic mice with RNF146 knockout mice (KO) and wild-type mice, and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were subjected to angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation to induce cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. RNF146 expression was significantly increased in hypertrophied murine hearts and Ang II-stimulated NRCMs. RNF146-KO mice and knockdown of RNF146 NRCMs attenuated TAC- or Ang II-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy. Conversely, enforced expression of RNF146 aggravated these changes. Mechanistically, we found that RNF146 KO or knockdown increased the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Furthermore, we found that RNF146 KO or knockdown decreased ubiquitination of Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway in a dependent manner. In conclusion, RNF146 targets LKB1 protein for ubiquitin–proteasome degradation in cardiomyocytes and subsequently promotes cardiac hypertrophy by suppressing the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Breast cancer metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Hypoxia in the tumor mass is believed to trigger cell migration, which is involved in a crucial process of breast cancer metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying aggressive behavior under hypoxic conditions have not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate the significant motility of MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions compared to that of cells cultured under normoxic conditions. MDA-MB-231 cells under hypoxic conditions showed a significant increase in Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) expression level, which was observed to co-locate in lamellipodia formation. Inhibition of NHE1 significantly suppressed the intracellular pH and the expression of mesenchymal markers, thereby blocking the high migration activity in hypoxia. Moreover, treatment with ciglitazone, a potent and selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist, modulated hypoxia-enhanced motion in cells via the repression of NHE1. These findings highlight that NHE1 is required for migratory activity through the enhancement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MDA-MB-231 cells under hypoxic conditions, and we propose new drug repurposing strategies targeting hypoxia based on NHE1 suppression by effective usage of PPARγ agonists.

Abstract: Summary
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has emerged as a clinically important opportunistic infection in HIV patients, as VL/HIV co-infected patients suffer from frequent VL relapse. Here, we follow cohorts of VL patients with or without HIV in Ethiopia. By the end of the study, 78.1% of VL/HIV—but none of the VL patients—experience VL relapse. Despite a clinically defined cure, VL/HIV patients maintain higher parasite loads, lower BMI, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. We identify three immunological markers associated with VL relapse in VL/HIV patients: (1) failure to restore antigen-specific production of IFN-γ, (2) persistently lower CD4+ T cell counts, and (3) higher expression of PD1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We show that these three markers, which can be measured in primary hospital settings in Ethiopia, combine well in predicting VL relapse. The use of our prediction model has the potential to improve disease management and patient care.

Abstract: The inflammatory microenvironment has been demonstrated to play a role in folliculogenesis, ovulation and premature ovarian failure (POF), as well as infertility. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of inflammation in modulating growth and apoptosis in granulosa cells (GCs), the main components of ovarian follicles. ELISA was used to analyze the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) in follicular fluid samples and GCs derived from POF patients and healthy normal individuals. CCK-8, flow cytometry and TUNEL assays were used to assess the effect of IL-4 on GC growth and apoptosis. Western blotting was used to examine the effect of IL-4 on the activation of PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2 and Jnk signaling. The results showed that IL-4, IL-1β and IL-6 levels were increased in follicular fluid samples and GCs derived from POF patients compared with those from healthy individuals. GC growth was weakened when cells were treated with IL-4, while apoptosis was increased. In addition, IL-4 increased the level of p-Akt/Akt in GCs. In addition, LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, abolished the effect of IL-4 by inhibiting GC growth and promoting apoptosis. In summary, this study demonstrated that IL-4 levels were increased in POF samples and that IL-4 could inhibit GC growth and induce GC apoptosis by activating PI3K/Akt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third human coronavirus within 20 years that gave rise to a life-threatening disease and the first to reach pandemic spread. To make therapeutic headway against current and future coronaviruses, the biology of coronavirus RNA during infection must be precisely understood. Here, we present a robust and generalizable framework combining high-throughput confocal and super-resolution microscopy imaging to study coronavirus infection at the nanoscale. Using the model human coronavirus HCoV-229E, we specifically labeled coronavirus genomic RNA (gRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) via multi-color RNA immunoFISH and visualized their localization patterns within the cell. The 10-nm resolution achieved by our approach uncovers a striking spatial organization of gRNA and dsRNA into three distinct structures and enables quantitative characterization of the status of the infection after antiviral drug treatment. Our approach provides a comprehensive imaging framework that will enable future investigations of coronavirus fundamental biology and therapeutic effects.

Abstract: Summary
DnaK is the bacterial homolog of Hsp70, an ATP-dependent chaperone that helps cofactor proteins to catalyze nascent protein folding and salvage misfolded proteins. In the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), DnaK and its cofactors are proposed antimycobacterial targets, yet few small-molecule inhibitors or probes exist for these families of proteins. Here, we describe the repurposing of a drug called telaprevir that is able to allosterically inhibit the ATPase activity of DnaK and to prevent chaperone function by mimicking peptide substrates. In mycobacterial cells, telaprevir disrupts DnaK- and cofactor-mediated cellular proteostasis, resulting in enhanced efficacy of aminoglycoside antibiotics and reduced resistance to the frontline TB drug rifampin. Hence, this work contributes to a small but growing collection of protein chaperone inhibitors, and it demonstrates that these molecules disrupt bacterial mechanisms of survival in the presence of different antibiotic classes.

Abstract: Summary
Regeneration of amputated digit tips relies on mesenchymal progenitor cells and their differentiation into replacement bone and tissue stroma. Natural killer (NK) cells have well-characterized roles in antigen-independent killing of virally infected, pre-tumorous, or stressed cells; however, the potential for cytotoxic activity against regenerative progenitor cells is unclear. We identified NK cell recruitment to the regenerating digit tip, and NK cytotoxicity was observed against osteoclast and osteoblast progenitors. Adoptive cell transplants of spleen NK (SpNK) or thymus NK (ThNK) donor cells into immunodeficient mice demonstrated ThNK cell-induced apoptosis with a reduction in osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and proliferative cells, resulting in inhibition of regeneration. Adoptive transfer of NK cells deficient in NK cell activation genes identified that promotion of regeneration by SpNK cells requires Ncr1, whereas inhibition by ThNK cells is mediated via Klrk1 and perforin. Successful future therapies aimed at enhancing regeneration will require a deeper understanding of progenitor cell protection from NK cell cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Adult skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are important for muscle regeneration and constitute a potential source of cell therapy. However, upon isolation, MuSCs rapidly exit quiescence and lose transplantation potency. Maintenance of the quiescent state in vitro preserves MuSC transplantation efficiency and provides an opportunity to study the biology of quiescence. Here we show that Tubastatin A (TubA), an Hdac6 inhibitor, prevents primary cilium resorption, maintains quiescence, and enhances MuSC survival ex vivo. Phenotypic characterization and transcriptomic analysis of TubA-treated cells revealed that TubA maintains most of the biological features and molecular signatures of quiescence. Furthermore, TubA-treated MuSCs showed improved engraftment ability upon transplantation. TubA also induced a return to quiescence and improved engraftment of cycling MuSCs, revealing a potentially expanded application for MuSC therapeutics. Altogether, these studies demonstrate the ability of TubA to maintain MuSC quiescence ex vivo and to enhance the therapeutic potential of MuSCs and their progeny.

Abstract: Summary
Efforts to target glucose metabolism in cancer have been limited by the poor potency and specificity of existing anti-glycolytic agents and a poor understanding of the glucose dependence of cancer subtypes in vivo. Here, we present an extensively characterized series of potent, orally bioavailable inhibitors of the class I glucose transporters (GLUTs). The representative compound KL-11743 specifically blocks glucose metabolism, triggering an acute collapse in NADH pools and a striking accumulation of aspartate, indicating a dramatic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Disrupting mitochondrial metabolism via chemical inhibition of electron transport, deletion of the malate-aspartate shuttle component GOT1, or endogenous mutations in tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, causes synthetic lethality with KL-11743. Patient-derived xenograft models of succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA)-deficient cancers are specifically sensitive to KL-11743, providing direct evidence that TCA cycle-mutant tumors are vulnerable to GLUT inhibitors in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
In the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to transit-amplifying progenitor (TAP) cells. These progenitors reside in different subniche locations, implying that cell movement must accompany lineage progression, but the dynamic behaviors of adult NSCs and TAPs remain largely unexplored. Here, we performed live time-lapse imaging with computer-based image analysis of young and aged 3D V-SVZ wholemounts from transgenic mice with fluorescently distinguished NSCs and TAP cells. Young V-SVZ progenitors are highly dynamic, with regular process outgrowth and retraction and cell migration. However, these activities dramatically declined with age. An examination of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed age-associated changes in the Rho-Rock pathway that are important for cell motility. Applying a small molecule to inhibit ROCK transformed young into old V-SVZ progenitor cell dynamic behaviors. Hence RHO-ROCK signaling is critical for normal adult NSC and TAP movement and interactions, which are compromised with age, concomitant with the loss of regenerative ability.

Abstract: Summary
The Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) transcriptional coactivator contains a four-protein subcomplex called the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) module that removes ubiquitin from histone H2B-K120. The human DUB module contains the catalytic subunit ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22), which is overexpressed in a number of cancers that are resistant to available therapies. We screened a massive combinatorial library of cyclic peptides and identified potent inhibitors of USP22. The top hit was highly specific for USP22 compared with a panel of 44 other human DUBs. Cells treated with peptide had increased levels of H2B monoubiquitination, demonstrating the ability of the cyclic peptides to enter human cells and inhibit H2B deubiquitination. These macrocycle inhibitors are, to our knowledge, the first reported inhibitors of USP22/SAGA DUB module and show promise for development.

Abstract: Summary
The urgent need for, but limited availability of, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines worldwide has led to widespread consideration of dose-sparing strategies. Here, we evaluate the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses following BNT162b2 vaccination in 150 previously SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals from a population-based cohort. One week after first vaccine dose, spike protein antibody levels are 27-fold higher and neutralizing antibody titers 12-fold higher, exceeding titers of fully vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-naive controls, with minimal additional boosting after the second dose. Neutralizing antibody titers against four variants of concern increase after vaccination; however, overall neutralization breadth does not improve. Pre-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers and time since infection have the largest positive effect on titers following vaccination. COVID-19 severity and the presence of comorbidities have no discernible impact on vaccine response. In conclusion, a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine up to 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection offers higher neutralizing antibody titers than 2 vaccine doses in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals.

Abstract: IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10, CXCL10) has been widely demonstrated to be involved in multiple kidney pathological processes. However, the role of CXCL10 in renal fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, Cxcl10-deﬁcient (Cxcl10−/−) mice were used to generate the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model. The level of renal fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration was examined in vivo and the effects of CXCL10 on EMT process of HK-2 cells was investigated in vitro. We observed that the injury degree of renal tissue and the collagen deposition levels were lighter and the expression of α-SMA, collagen I and ﬁbronectin was significantly reduced in Cxcl10−/− mice, while the expression of E-cadherin was increased. However, interstitial F4/80-positive macrophages and CD4-positive T lymphocytes were unaffected by knockout of Cxcl10. Furthermore, IFN-γ or CXCL10 stimulation could obviously promote the expression of α-SMA, collagen I, ﬁbronectin and reduce the expression of E-cadherin in HK-2 cells, which could be inhibited by transfection of Cxcl10-siRNA. Our findings suggested Cxcl10 knockout could reduce renal dysfunction and inhibit renal fibrosis through regulating EMT process of renal tubular epithelial cells in murine UUO model. These results may provide a novel insight into the mechanism and a potential therapy target of renal fibrosis.

Abstract: Background
The tumor suppressive function of microRNA-432-5p (miR-432-5p) has been reported in several human malignances. This study aimed to probe the expression profile and role of miR-432-5p in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the molecular mechanism.
Methods
Differentially expressed miRNAs between CRC and healthy samples were screened using a miRNA expression dataset GSE136020. The related molecules were identified by integrated bioinformatic analyses. A murine model of primary CRC was established and xenograft tumors were induced in mice. Altered expression of DNMT3B, miR-432-5p and cyclin D2 (CCND2) were introduced in CRC cells to determine their roles in the development of CRC.
Results
miR-432-5p was downregulated in CRC according to the GSE136020 dataset. CCND2 mRNA was confirmed as a target of miR-432-5p. miR-432-5p was downregulated, whereas CCND2 was abundantly expressed in CRC tissues and cells. DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) induced DNA methylation at the CpG island of miR-432-5p to inhibit its expression. miR-432-5p mimic significantly suppressed tumorigenesis of primary CRC in mice. Downregulation of DNMT3B weakened viability, invasiveness, blocked the cell cycle progression of CRC cells in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. However, additional downregulation of miR-432-5p or upregulation of CCND2 restored the malignant behaviors of CRC cells.
Conclusion
This study showed that DNMT3B induced DNA methylation and downregulation of miR-432-5p to promote development of CRC by upregulating CCND2.

Abstract: Summary
Canonical targeting of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to repress developmental genes is mediated by cell-type-specific, paralogous chromobox (CBX) proteins (CBX2, 4, 6, 7, and 8). Based on their central role in silencing and their dysregulation associated with human disease including cancer, CBX proteins are attractive targets for small-molecule chemical probe development. Here, we have used a quantitative and target-specific cellular assay to discover a potent positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of CBX8. The PAM activity of UNC7040 antagonizes H3K27me3 binding by CBX8 while increasing interactions with nucleic acids. We show that treatment with UNC7040 leads to efficient and selective eviction of CBX8-containing PRC1 from chromatin, loss of silencing, and reduced proliferation across different cancer cell lines.

Abstract: Summary
The standard regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 includes two doses administered three weeks apart. However, some public health authorities spaced these doses, raising questions about efficacy. We analyzed longitudinal humoral responses against the D614G strain and variants of concern for SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-naive and previously infected individuals who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with sixteen weeks between doses. While administering a second dose to previously infected individuals did not significantly improve humoral responses, these responses significantly increased in naive individuals after a 16-week spaced second dose, achieving similar levels as in previously infected individuals. Comparing these responses to those elicited in individuals receiving a short (4-week) dose interval showed that a 16-week interval induced more robust responses among naive vaccinees. These findings suggest that a longer interval between vaccine doses does not compromise efficacy and may allow greater flexibility in vaccine administration.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal malignancy which has insufficient treatment options. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) GASAL1 was discovered to be conspicuously up-regulated in HCC. However, the study on the role of GASAL1 in HCC reamins limited. Our study aimed at exploring the role and mechanism of GASAL1 in HCC. RT-qPCR or Western blot was conducted to examine the expression of RNAs or proteins. Functional assays were carried out to investigate the impact of GASAL1, USP10, and PCNA on HCC cells. Mechanism assays were performed to fathom out the relationship among GASAL1, miR-193b-5p, USP10, and PCNA. In vivo assays were also employed to determine the role of GASAL1 in HCC tumor growth and metastases. According to the data collected, GASAL1 displayed a high expression in HCC cells and GASAL1 knockdown led to impeded cell proliferation and migration, as well as tumor progression. A series of mechanism analysis demonstrated GASAL1 could sponge miR-193b-5p to raise the expression of USP10. Moreover, USP10 could induce PCNA deubiquitination to promote HCC cell growth. To conclude, GASAL1 plays an oncogenic role in HCC. GASAL1 could up-regulate USP10 via competitively binding to miR-193b-5p. And USP10 could strengthen cell proliferative and migratory abilities through deubiquitinating PCNA.

Abstract: Summary
A fraction of COVID-19 convalescent individuals mount a potent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-1. To uncover their humoral response in detail, we performed single B cell analysis from 10 SARS-CoV-2 elite neutralizers. We isolated and analyzed 126 monoclonal antibodies, many of which were sarbecovirus cross-reactive, with some displaying merbecovirus- and embecovirus-reactivity. Several isolated broadly neutralizing antibodies were effective against B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.429, B.1.617, and B.1.617.2 variants and 19 prominent potential escape sites. Furthermore, assembly of 716,806 SARS-CoV-2 sequences predicted emerging escape variants, which were also effectively neutralized. One of these broadly neutralizing potent antibodies, R40-1G8, is a IGHV3-53 RBD-class-1 antibody. Remarkably, cryo-EM analysis revealed that R40-1G8 has a flexible binding mode, targeting both “up” and “down” conformations of the RBD. Given the threat of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, we demonstrate that elite neutralizers are a valuable source for isolating ultrapotent antibody candidates to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) are causally linked to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with poor prognosis. Available FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) preferentially target inactive or active conformations of FLT3. Moreover, they co-target kinases for normal hematopoiesis, are vulnerable to therapy-associated tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) FLT3 mutants, or lack low nanomolar activity. We show that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor marbotinib suppresses the phosphorylation of FLT3-ITD and the growth of permanent and primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD. This also applies to leukemic cells carrying FLT3-ITD/TKD mutants that confer resistance to clinically used FLT3i. Marbotinib shows high selectivity for FLT3 and alters signaling, reminiscent of genetic elimination of FLT3-ITD. Molecular docking shows that marbotinib fits in opposite orientations into inactive and active conformations of FLT3. The water-soluble marbotinib-carbamate significantly prolongs survival of mice with FLT3-driven leukemia. Marbotinib is a nanomolar next-generation FLT3i that represents a hybrid inhibitory principle.

Abstract: Summary
The Pax family of developmental control genes are frequently deregulated in human disease. In the kidney, Pax2 is expressed in developing nephrons but not in adult proximal and distal tubules, whereas polycystic kidney epithelia or renal cell carcinoma continues to express high levels. Pax2 reduction in mice or cell culture can slow proliferation of cystic epithelial cells or renal cancer cells. Thus, inhibition of Pax activity may be a viable, cell-type-specific therapy. We designed an unbiased, cell-based, high-throughput screen that identified triazolo pyrimidine derivatives that attenuate Pax transactivation ability. We show that BG-1 inhibits Pax2-positive cancer cell growth and target gene expression but has little effect on Pax2-negative cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation suggests that these inhibitors prevent Pax protein interactions with the histone H3K4 methylation complex at Pax target genes in renal cells. Thus, these compounds may provide structural scaffolds for kidney-specific inhibitors with therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Switching from a low-fat and high-fiber diet to a Western-style high-fat and high-sugar diet causes microbiota imbalances that underlay many pathological conditions (i.e., dysbiosis). Although the effects of dietary changes on microbiota composition and functions are well documented, their impact in gut bacterial evolution remains unexplored. We followed the emergence of mutations in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prevalent fiber-degrading microbiota member, upon colonization of the murine gut under different dietary regimens. B. thetaiotaomicron evolved rapidly in the gut and Western-style diet selected for mutations that promote degradation of mucin-derived glycans. Periodic dietary changes caused fluctuations in the frequency of such mutations and were associated with metabolic shifts, resulting in the maintenance of higher intraspecies genetic diversity compared to constant dietary regimens. These results show that dietary changes leave a genetic signature in microbiome members and suggest that B. thetaiotaomicron genetic diversity could be a biomarker for dietary differences among individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the breast cancer subtype with the poorest clinical outcome. The PIM family of kinases has emerged as a factor that is both overexpressed in TNBC and associated with poor outcomes. Preclinical data suggest that TNBC with an elevated MYC expression is sensitive to PIM inhibition. However, clinical observations indicate that the efficacy of PIM inhibitors as single agents may be limited, suggesting the need for combination therapies. Our screening effort identifies PIM and the 20S proteasome inhibition as the most synergistic combination. PIM inhibitors, when combined with proteasome inhibitors, induce significant antitumor effects, including abnormal accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, increased proteotoxic stress, and the inability of NRF1 to counter loss in proteasome activity. Thus, the identified combination could represent a rational combination therapy against MYC-overexpressing TNBC that is readily translatable to clinical investigations.

Abstract: Sleep bruxism (SB) is a sleep-related movement disorder characterized by grinding and clenching of the teeth during sleep. We previously found a significant association between SB and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6313, in the neuronal serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A), and established human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from SB patients with a genetic variant. To elucidate the electrophysiological characteristics of SB iPSC-derived neural cells bearing an SB-related genetic variant, we generated ventral hindbrain neurons from SB patients and unaffected controls, and explored the intrinsic membrane properties of these neurons using the patch-clamp technique. We found that the electrophysiological properties of iPSC-derived neurons mature in a time-dependent manner in long-term control cultures. SB neurons exhibited higher action potential firing frequency, higher gain, and shorter action potential half duration. This is the first in vitro modeling of SB using patient-specific iPSCs. The revealed electrophysiological characteristics may serve as a benchmark for further investigation of pathogenic mechanisms underlying SB. Moreover, our results on long-term cultures provide a strategy to define the functional maturity of human neurons in vitro, which can be implemented for stem cell research of neurogenesis, and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Promoting immune activation within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a promising therapeutic strategy to reverse tumor immunosuppression and elicit anti-tumor immunity. To enable tumor-localized immunotherapy following intravenous administration, we chemically conjugated a polyspecific integrin-binding peptide (PIP) to an immunostimulant (Toll-like receptor 9 [TLR9] agonist: CpG) to generate a tumor-targeted immunomodulatory agent, referred to as PIP-CpG. We demonstrate that systemic delivery of PIP-CpG induces tumor regression and enhances therapeutic efficacy compared with untargeted CpG in aggressive murine breast and pancreatic cancer models. Furthermore, PIP-CpG transforms the immune-suppressive TME dominated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells into a lymphocyte-rich TME infiltrated with activated CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells. Finally, we show that T cells are required for therapeutic efficacy and that PIP-CpG treatment generates tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. These data demonstrate that conjugation to a synthetic tumor-targeted peptide can improve the efficacy of systemically administered immunostimulants and lead to durable anti-tumor immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Rapamycin is widely recognized as an inhibitor of mTOR, and has been approved for clinical use as an immunosuppressant. Its potencies in anti-cancer, anti-aging, and neurodegenerative diseases are emergingly established. The exploration of other targets of rapamycin will further elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. In this study, we use a chemical proteomics strategy that has identified STAT3, a transcription factor considered to be undruggable, as a direct functional protein target of rapamycin. Together with other multi-dimensional proteomics data, we show that rapamycin treatment in cell culture significantly inhibits c-Myc-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, we show that rapamycin suppresses tumor growth along with a decreased expression of STAT3 and c-Myc in an in vivo xenograft mouse model for hepatocellular carcinoma. Our data suggest that rapamycin acts directly on STAT3 to decrease its transcription activity, providing important information for the pharmacological and pharmaceutical development of STAT3 inhibitors for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) variant is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), while the APOE2 allele is protective. A major question is how different APOE genotypes affect the physiology of astrocytes, the main APOE-producing brain cells. Here, we differentiated human APOE-isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (APOE4, E3, E2, and APOE knockout [APOE-KO]) to functional “iAstrocytes”. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis showed genotype-dependent reductions of cholesterol and lipid metabolic and biosynthetic pathways (reduction: APOE4 > E3 > E2). Cholesterol efflux and biosynthesis were reduced in APOE4 iAstrocytes, while subcellular localization of cholesterol in lysosomes was elevated. An increase in immunoregulatory proteomic pathways (APOE4 > E3 > E2) was accompanied by elevated cytokine release in APOE4 cells (APOE4 > E3 > E2 > KO). Activation of iAstrocytes exacerbated proteomic changes and cytokine secretion mostly in APOE4 iAstrocytes, while APOE2 and APOE-KO iAstrocytes were least affected. Taken together, APOE4 iAstrocytes reveal a disease-relevant phenotype, causing dysregulated cholesterol/lipid homeostasis, increased inflammatory signaling, and reduced β-amyloid uptake, while APOE2 iAstrocytes show opposing effects.

Abstract: Summary
The genetic modification of stem cells (SCs) is typically achieved using integrating vectors, whose potential integrative genotoxicity and propensity for epigenetic silencing during differentiation limit their application. The genetic modification of cells should provide sustainable levels of transgene expression, without compromising the viability of a cell or its progeny. We developed nonviral, nonintegrating, and autonomously replicating minimally sized DNA nanovectors to persistently genetically modify SCs and their differentiated progeny without causing any molecular or genetic damage. These DNA vectors are capable of efficiently modifying murine and human pluripotent SCs with minimal impact and without differentiation-mediated transgene silencing or vector loss. We demonstrate that these vectors remain episomal and provide robust and sustained transgene expression during self-renewal and targeted differentiation of SCs both in vitro and in vivo through embryogenesis and differentiation into adult tissues, without damaging their phenotypic characteristics.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) are targets for a number of acute poisons. Many of these agents act as allosteric modulators of channel activity and serve as powerful chemical tools for understanding channel function. Herein, we detail studies with batrachotoxin (BTX), a potent steroidal amine, and three ester derivatives prepared through de novo synthesis against recombinant NaV subtypes (rNaV1.4 and hNaV1.5). Two of these compounds, BTX-B and BTX-cHx, are functionally equivalent to BTX, hyperpolarizing channel activation and blocking both fast and slow inactivation. BTX-yne—a C20-n-heptynoate ester—is a conspicuous outlier, eliminating fast but not slow inactivation. This property differentiates BTX-yne among other NaV modulators as a unique reagent that separates inactivation processes. These findings are supported by functional studies with bacterial NaVs (BacNaVs) that lack a fast inactivation gate. The availability of BTX-yne should advance future efforts aimed at understanding NaV gating mechanisms and designing allosteric regulators of NaV activity.

Abstract: Summary
Human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) transplantation holds great potential to treat neurological diseases. However, hNPC grafts take a long time to differentiate into mature neurons due to their intrinsically prolonged developmental timetable. Here, we report that postoperative physical exercise (PE), a prevailing rehabilitation intervention, promotes the neuronal commitment, maturation, and integration of engrafted hNPCs, evidenced by forming more synapses, receiving more synaptic input from host neurons, and showing higher neuronal activity levels. More important, NPC transplantation, combined with PE, shows significant improvement in both structural and behavioral outcomes in stroke-damaged rats. PE enhances ingrowth of blood vessels around the infarction region and neural tract reorganization along the ischemic boundary. The combination of NPC transplantation and postoperative PE creates both a neurotrophic/growth factor-enriched proneuronal microenvironment and an ideal condition for activity-dependent plasticity to give full play to its effects. Our study provides a potential approach to treating patients with stroke injury.

Abstract: Resistance to platinum and PARP inhibitors represents a major barrier to the long-term survival of ovarian cancer patients. We aim to explore the potential role of chronic stress in drug resistance in ovarian cancer. Leveraging four ovarian cancer with chronic stress (OCCS) mouse models, we explore the therapeutic efficacy of platinum, Niraparib, and Docetaxel treatment in vivo, and compare the efficacy of these anti-tumor drugs in vitro using cell viability assays. Comparing the transcriptional characteristics in RNA-Seq of OCCS mice with public databases, we analyze the molecular mechanism of chronic stress promoting drug resistance in ovarian cancer. We find that chronic stress is positively correlated with platinum-resistant recurrence in ovarian cancer patients. Chronic stress can induce platinum and Niraparib resistance of ovarian cancer, but it does not affect the therapeutic efficacy of Docetaxel treatment in vivo. And the platinum-resistant cell lines are not sensitive to these anti-tumor drugs, which is different from the result in vivo. Then, we identify several gene networks and their constituent genes that are most significantly associated with chronic stress and drug resistance in ovarian cancer, including the glycolysis pathway and DNA damage. This study develops Niraparib and platinum-resistant in vivo models, reflecting the ability of OCCS mice to reproduce different aspects of human ovarian cancer molecular mechanism, and provides a new theoretical basis for overcoming the double drug resistance of ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Aims
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative disease that is pathologically characterized by destruction of the joint matrix and reduction of articular chondrocytes, resulting in joint deformity and motor dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms governing this pathology have not been elucidated to date.
Methods
In this study, we determined the expression levels of lncRNAs, circRNAs, and mRNAs extracted from synovial exosomes of OA and control patients. A network of circRNA/lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA interactions was established using MiRanda and TargetScan software to explore OA pathogenesis. The exosomal lncRNA, circRNA and mRNA expression profiles of the OA and control groups were analysed using LC human competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) microarrays. The differentially expressed genes were analysed to determine their potential roles in the pathogenesis of OA by bioinformatic analysis.
Results
There were 52 mRNAs, 196 lncRNAs and 98 circRNAs differentially expressed in synovial exosomes between osteoarthritis synovial and the control group. The final ceRNA network of lncRNAs and circRNAs exhibited a complex interaction between ncRNA and mRNA related to OA pathological mechanisms. An intersection analysis of the ceRNA network showed that 22 miRNAs, 45 lncRNAs, and 34 circRNAs enriched in the PI3K/Akt and autophagy pathways correlated with 7 mRNAs and may play important roles in OA pathological mechanisms.
Conclusion

Abstract: The accumulation of activated myofibroblastic pancreatic stellate cells (MF-PSCs) induces pancreatic cancer desmoplasia. These MF-PSCs are derived from quiescent pancreatic stellate cells (Q-PSCs). MF-PSCs in pancreatic cancer tend to glycolysis. However, increased glycolysis alone could not be sufficient for the increased metabolic demands of MF-PSCs. Yap and Myc signaling activation is involved in pancreatic cancer metabolism. Since elucidating the metabolic processes of MF-PSCs may be a promising strategy to suppress pancreatic cancer desmoplasia, we explored whether glutaminolysis meets the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of Q-PSCs converted into MF-PSCs and whether this is mediated by Yap signaling to Myc. In this study, we found that during the transdifferentiation of Q-PSCs into MF-PSCs, glutaminolysis regulatory genes were upregulated, and suppression of glutaminolysis inhibited transdifferentiation. Disrupting glutaminolysis in MF-PSCs inhibited cell growth, mitochondrial respiration, and fibrogenesis, while treatment of MF-PSCs with DKG (a glutaminolysis metabolite) reversed these activities. The expression of glutaminase (GLS1), a rate-limiting enzyme in glutaminolysis, was upregulated by Yap overexpression. Yap upregulates Myc to regulate the expression of GLS1 in MF-PSCs. Yap and Myc inhibitors disrupted glutaminolysis and inhibited myofibroblastic activities in PSCs. Thus, Yap-Myc signaling controls glutaminolysis to activate PSCs and might be a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer desmoplasia.

Abstract: Honey-processed Astragalus is a dosage form of Radix Astragalus mixed with honey by a traditional Chinese medicine processing method which improves immune activity. This pharmacological activity of honey-processed Astragalus polysaccharide (HP-APS) might be due to structural changes during the honey roasting process. Previously, we have prepared and characterized HP-APS and preliminarily found its anti-inflammatory effects. However, whether the pharmacodynamic activity of HP-APS induces tumor cell apoptosis and the mechanisms responsible for the immunogenic death (ICD) have not been elucidated. Here, A549, MC38 and B16 cells were used to evaluate the cells viability, apoptosis and cell cycles, respectively. Cellular immunogenic cell death-related molecules calreticulin (CRT), Heat Shock Proteins (HSP)70, major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I), and co-stimulator molecules CD80/CD86 were determined by flow cytometry. The extracellular ATP release was also detected. B16-OVA and MC38-OVA cells were treated with HP-APS and co-cultivated with OT1 mouse of CD3+T cells for assessment of proliferation, in mice model, and the establishment of C57BL/B6 mouse model bearing B16 cells for assessment of HP-APS the regulation of immune activity in vivo. Our results showed that HP-APS has an inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation, which induces tumor cell apoptosis, preventing cells-transforming from G1 phase to S phase in cell cycles. Furthermore, HP-APS could effectively increase the expression of HSP70, CRT, MHC-I, CD86, CD80 and ATP release. T cell proliferation index is significantly improved. CD3 cell proliferation in OT1 mice was significantly increased from the 4th generation to the 5th generation. Moreover, the results have also shown that HP-APS could inhibit tumor growth by increasing immune cell infiltration in the tumor tissues. In the mouse melanoma model with HP-APS treatment, the tumor weight and volume were significantly reduced, and the growth of melanoma was inhibited. CD8+ T is significantly increased. The ratio of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells numbers are also significantly increased in mouse spleen, but it is less than PD-1 alone treatment separately. Altogether, these findings suggest that HP-APS exerts anti-tumor effects, and that its underlying mechanisms might be associated with the expression of immunogenicity cell death related molecules and the immunomodulatory effects of immune cells.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes diverse outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to respiratory distress and death. A major unresolved question is whether prior immunity to endemic, human common cold coronaviruses (hCCCoVs) impacts susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunity following infection and vaccination. Therefore, we analyzed samples from the same individuals before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We found hCCCoV antibody levels increase after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, demonstrating cross-reactivity. However, a case-control study indicates that baseline hCCCoV antibody levels are not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rather, higher magnitudes of pre-existing betacoronavirus antibodies correlate with more SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following infection, an indicator of greater disease severity. Additionally, immunization with hCCCoV spike proteins before SARS-CoV-2 immunization impedes the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in mice. Together, these data suggest that pre-existing hCCCoV antibodies hinder SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based immunity following infection and provide insight on how pre-existing coronavirus immunity impacts SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical considering emerging variants.

Abstract: Calcification of the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) involves differential expression of various RNA genes, which is achieved through complex regulatory networks that are controlled in part by transcription factors and microRNAs. We previously found that miR-195–5p regulates the osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) by targeting the TGF-β pathway. However, the transcriptional regulation of miR-195–5p in calcified BAV patients is not yet clear. In this study, stenotic aortic valve tissues from patients with BAVs and tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs) were collected. Candidate transcription factors of miR-195–5p were predicted by bioinformatics analysis and tested in diseased valves and in male porcine VICs. SP2 gene expression and the corresponding protein levels in BAV were significantly lower than those in TAV, and a low SP2 expression level environment in VICs resulted in remarkable increases in RNA expression levels of RUNX2, BMP2, collagen 1, MMP2, and MMP9 and the corresponding proteins. ChIP assays revealed that SP2 directly bound to the transcription promoter region of miR-195–5p. Cotransfection of SP2 shRNA and a miR-195–5p mimic in porcine VICs demonstrated that SP2 repressed SMAD7 expression via miR-195–5p, while knockdown of SP2 increased the mRNA expression of SMAD7 and the corresponding protein and attenuated Smad 2/3 expression. Immunofluorescence staining of diseased valves confirmed that the functional proteins of osteogenesis differentiation, including RUNX2, BMP2, collagen 1, and osteocalcin, were overexpressed in BAVs. In Conclusion, the transcription factor Sp2 is expressed at low levels in VICs from BAV patients, which has a negative impact on miR-195–5p expression by binding its promoter region and partially promotes calcification through a SMAD-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Imbalanced iron homeostasis plays a crucial role in neurological diseases, yet direct imaging evidence revealing the distribution of active ferrous iron (Fe2+) in the living brain remains scarce. Here, we present a near-infrared excited two-photon fluorescent probe (FeP) for imaging changes of Fe2+ flux in the living epileptic mouse brain. In vivo 3D two-photon brain imaging with FeP directly revealed abnormal elevation of Fe2+ in the epileptic mouse brain. Moreover, we found that dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a lead compound discovered through probe-based high-throughput screening, plays a critical role in modulating iron homeostasis. In addition, we revealed that DHA might exert its antiepileptic effects by modulating iron homeostasis in the brain and finally inhibiting ferroptosis. This work provides a reliable chemical tool for assessing the status of ferrous iron in the living epileptic mouse brain and may aid the rapid discovery of antiepileptic drug candidates.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is considered to be a promising therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) and will soon be translated to the clinical phase. However, how grafted neuronal activity influences functional recovery has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show the locomotor functional changes caused by inhibiting the neuronal activity of grafted cells using a designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD). In vitro analyses of inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di)-expressing cells demonstrated the precise inhibition of neuronal activity via administration of clozapine N-oxide. This inhibition led to a significant decrease in locomotor function in SCI mice with cell transplantation, which was exclusively observed following the maturation of grafted neurons. Furthermore, trans-synaptic tracing revealed the integration of graft neurons into the host motor circuitry. These results highlight the significance of engrafting functionally competent neurons by hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation for sufficient recovery from SCI.

Abstract: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the most common chronic diseases with increasing incidence and mortality. Liquiritigenin (LQG) is shown to protect mice from cardiotoxicity. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our study aimed to reveal the role of ARHGAP18 in LQG-mediated cardioprotective effects in CHF. In the current study, CHF cell model and rat model were established by the application of doxorubicin (DOX). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and cell apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. The cardiac function of rats was evaluated by measuring left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and serum level of lactate dehydrogenase and brain natriuretic peptide. The expression of active RhoA was elevated and that of ARHGAP18 was decreased in DOX-induced CHF cell model. ARHGAP18 could reduce DOX-induced RhoA activation, ROS elevation, and cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, the knockdown of ARHGAP18 could promote the activation of RhoA, the level of ROS, and the rate of cell apoptosis, which could be reversed by the application of RhoA inhibitor. LQG promoted the expression of ARHGAP18 and exerted similar effects of ARHGAP18 in CHF cell model. The application of LQG could also reverse the effects mediated by ARHGAP18 knockdown. Moreover, LQG significantly improved cardiac function and ameliorated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity of CHF rats. In conclusion, LQG could alleviate DOX-induced CHF via promoting ARHGAP18 and suppressing RhoA/ROCK1 pathway. LQG was a potential agent for CHF treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The Columbia Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) Center is developing PANACEA, a resource comprising dose-responses and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles of 25 cell lines perturbed with ∼400 clinical oncology drugs, to study a tumor-specific drug mechanism of action. Here, this resource serves as the basis for a DREAM Challenge assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of computational algorithms for de novo drug polypharmacology predictions. Dose-response and perturbational profiles for 32 kinase inhibitors are provided to 21 teams who are blind to the identity of the compounds. The teams are asked to predict high-affinity binding targets of each compound among ∼1,300 targets cataloged in DrugBank. The best performing methods leverage gene expression profile similarity analysis as well as deep-learning methodologies trained on individual datasets. This study lays the foundation for future integrative analyses of pharmacogenomic data, reconciliation of polypharmacology effects in different tumor contexts, and insights into network-based assessments of drug mechanisms of action.

Abstract: The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is known to have protective effects not only against tuberculosis but also against other unrelated infectious diseases caused by different pathogens. Several epidemiological studies have also documented the beneficial influence of BCG vaccine in reducing both susceptibility to and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The protective, non-specific effects of BCG vaccination would be related to an antigen-independent enhancement of the innate immunity, termed trained immunity. However, the knowledge that heat shock protein (HSP)65 is the main antigen of Mycobacterium bovis BCG prompted us to verify whether sequence similarity existed between HSP65 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nuclear (N) proteins that could support an antigen-driven immune protection of BCG vaccine. The results of the in silico investigation showed an extensive sequence similarity of HSP65 with both the viral proteins, especially SARS-CoV-2 S, that also involved the regions comprising immunodominant epitopes. The finding that the predicted B cell and CD4+ T cell epitopes of HSP65 shared strong similarity with the predicted B and T cell epitopes of both SARS-CoV-2 S and N would support the possibility of a cross-immune reaction of HSP65 of BCG with SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: After the severe initial insults of acute kidney injury, progressive kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis may occur, the peritubular capillary (PTC) rarefaction plays a key role in the disease progression. However, the mechanisms of PTC damage were not fully understood and potential therapeutic interventions were not explored. Previous studies of our research team and others in this field suggested that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transplanted into the AKI rat model may preserve the kidney function and pathological changes. In the current study, with the ischemia/reperfusion AKI rat model, we revealed that BMSCs transplantation attenuated the renal function decrease in the AKI model through preserving the peritubular capillaries (PTCs) function. The density of PTCs is maintained by BMSCs transplantation in the AKI model, detachment and relocation of pericytes in the PTCs diminished. Then we established that BMSCs transplantation may attenuate the renal fibrosis and preserve the kidney function after AKI by repairing the PTCs. Improving the vitality of pericytes, suppressing the detachment and trans-differentiation of pericytes, directly differentiation of BMSCs into pericytes by BMSCs transplantation all participate in the PTC repair. Through these processes, BMSCs rescued the microvascular damage and improved the density of PTCs. As a result, a preliminary conclusion can be reached that BMSCs transplantation can be an effective therapy for delaying renal fibrosis after AKI.

Abstract: Stress is a common phenomenon that is attracting increasing attention. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gasotransmitter that plays an important role in many physiological and pathological events. Our study aimed to estimate the effect and the underlying mechanisms of the H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), against immobilization stress (IS)–induced lung injury. Forty adult male rats were classified into control group, NaHS group, and IS groups with and without NaHS treatment. Serum was obtained to determine corticosterone (CORT), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels. Lung H2S, nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Lung expressions of H2S synthesizing enzymes and Western blot analysis of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF 1α) were estimated. Histopathological changes and immunohistochemical assessment of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and caspase‐3 were also done. Pretreatment with NaHS led to marked histological protection from lung damage seen in IS rats. Furthermore, pretreatment with NaHS before IS protected lung H2S levels and expressions of H2S-synthesizing enzymes. Similarly, the levels of CORT, TNF-α, IL-10, MDA, TAC, NO, iNOS, HIF-1 α, and nuclear Nrf2 and expressions of NF-kB and caspase 3 were all maintained at near control levels in contrast to that in the IS rats. In conclusion, NaHS is protective against stress‐induced lung injury due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and antiapoptotic effects. Thus, NaHS can be used to minimize stress complications on lung.

Abstract: Summary
The induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target the hemagglutinin stalk domain is a promising strategy for the development of “universal” influenza virus vaccines. bNAbs can be boosted in adults by sequential exposure to heterosubtypic viruses through natural infection or vaccination. However, little is known about if or how bNAbs are induced by vaccination in more immunologically naive children. Here, we describe the impact of repeated seasonal influenza vaccination and vaccine type on induction of bNAbs against group 1 influenza viruses in a pediatric cohort enrolled in randomized controlled trials of seasonal influenza vaccination. Repeated seasonal vaccination results in significant boosting of a durable bNAb response. Boosting of serological bNAb titers is comparable within inactivated and live attenuated (LAIV) vaccinees and declines with age. These data provide insights into vaccine-elicited bNAb induction in children, which have important implications for the design of universal influenza vaccine modalities in this critical population.

Abstract: Summary
Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) encompasses a set of autosomal recessive genetic conditions that affect pigmentation in the eye, skin, and hair. OCA patients display reduced best-corrected visual acuity, reduced to absent ocular pigmentation, abnormalities in fovea development, and/or abnormal decussation of optic nerve fibers. It has been hypothesized that improving eye pigmentation could prevent or rescue some of the vision defects. The goal of the present study was to develop an in vitro model for studying pigmentation defects in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We developed a “disease in a dish” model for OCA1A and OCA2 types using induced pluripotent stem cells to generate RPE. The RPE is a monolayer of cells that are pigmented, polarized, and polygonal in shape, located between the neural retina and choroid, with an important role in vision. Here we show that RPE tissue derived in vitro from OCA patients recapitulates the pigmentation defects seen in albinism, while retaining the apical-basal polarity and normal polygonal morphology of the constituent RPE cells.

Abstract: Summary
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of respiratory illness in infants and the elderly. Although several vaccines have been developed, none have succeeded in part due to our incomplete understanding of the correlates of immune protection. While both T cells and antibodies play a role, emerging data suggest that antibody-mediated mechanisms alone may be sufficient to provide protection. Therefore, to map the humoral correlates of immunity against RSV, antibody responses across six different vaccines were profiled in a highly controlled nonhuman primate-challenge model. Viral loads were monitored in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and machine learning was used to determine the vaccine platform-agnostic antibody features associated with protection. Upper respiratory control was associated with virus-specific IgA levels, neutralization, and complement activity, whereas lower respiratory control was associated with Fc-mediated effector mechanisms. These findings provide critical compartment-specific insights toward the rational development of future vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Compounds that modulate H2O2 reaction networks have applications as targeted cancer therapeutics, as a subset of cancers exhibit sensitivity to this redox signal. Previous studies to identify therapeutics that induce oxidants have relied upon probes that respond to many different oxidants in cells, and thus do not report on only H2O2, a redox signal that selectively oxidizes proteins. Here we use a genetically encoded fluorescent probe for human peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) oxidation in screens for small-molecule compounds that modulate H2O2 pathways. We further characterize cellular responses to several compounds selected from the screen. Our results reveal that some, but not all, of the compounds enact H2O2-mediated toxicity in cells. Among them, SMER3, an antifungal, has not been reported as an oxidant-inducing drug. Several drugs, including cisplatin, that previously have been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) do not appear to oxidize Prx2, suggesting H2O2 is not among the ROS induced by those drugs.

Abstract: Hypertensive renal injury is accompanied by tubular interstitial fibrosis leading to increased risk for renal failure. This study aimed to explore the influences of miR-122–5p in hypertension-mediated renal fibrosis and damage. 14-week-old male SHR and WKY rats were randomly assigned to treat with rAAV-miR-122–5p or rAAV-GFP for 8 weeks. There were marked increases in miR-122–5p and Kim-1 levels and decreases in FOXO3 and SIRT6 levels in hypertensive rats. Transfection with rAAV-miR-122–5p triggered exacerbation of renal fibrosis, apoptosis and inflammatory injury in SHR, associated with downregulated levels of FOXO3, SIRT6, ATG5 and BNIP3 as well as upregulated expression of Kim-1, NOX4, CTGF, and TGF-β1. In cultured primary mouse renal tubular interstitial fibroblasts, exposure to angiotensin II resulted in obvious downregulation of FOXO3, SIRT6, ATG5, BNIP3 and nitric oxide levels as well as augmented cellular migration, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which were exacerbated by miR-122–5p mimic while rescued by miR-122–5p inhibitor and rhFOXO3, respectively. Notably, knockdown of FOXO3 strikingly blunted cellular protective effects of miR-122–5p inhibitor. In summary, miR-122–5p augments renal fibrosis, inflammatory and oxidant injury in hypertensive rats by suppressing the expression of FOXO3. Pharmacological inhibition of miR-122–5p has potential therapeutic significance for hypertensive renal injury and fibrosis-related kidney diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) grow as colonies with epithelial-like features including cell polarity and position-dependent features that contribute to symmetry breaking during development. Our study provides evidence that hPSC colonies exhibit position-dependent differences in apical structures and functions. With this apical difference, edge cells were preferentially labeled with amphipathic dyes, which enabled separation of edge and center cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Transcriptome comparison between center and edge cells showed differential expression of genes related to apicobasal polarization, cell migration, and endocytosis. Accordingly, different kinematics and mechanical dynamics were found between center and edge cells, and perturbed actin dynamics disrupted the position-dependent apical polarity. In addition, our dye-labeling approach could be utilized to sort out a certain cell population in differentiated micropatterned colonies. In summary, hPSC colonies have position-dependent differences in apical structures and properties, and actin dynamics appear to play an important role in the establishment of this position-dependent cell polarity.

Abstract: Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a unique proteolytic pathway, in which cytoplasmic proteins recognized by heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70/HSPA8) are transported into lysosomes for degradation. The substrate/chaperone complex binds to the cytosolic tail of the lysosomal-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A), but whether the interaction between Hsc70 and LAMP2A is direct or mediated by other molecules has remained to be elucidated. The structure of LAMP2A comprises a large lumenal domain composed of two domains, both with the β-prism fold, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. We previously reported the structural basis for the homophilic interaction of the lumenal domains of LAMP2A, using site-specific photo-crosslinking and/or steric hindrance within cells. In the present study, we introduced a photo-crosslinker into the cytoplasmic tail of LAMP2A and successfully detected its crosslinking with Hsc70, revealing this direct interaction for the first time. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the truncation of the membrane-distal domain within the lumenal domain of LAMP2A reduced the amount of Hsc70 that coimmunoprecipitated with LAMP2A. Our present results suggested that the two-domain architecture of the lumenal domains of LAMP2A underlies the interaction with Hsc70 at the cytoplasmic surface of the lysosome.

Abstract: Cervical cancer (CC) is among the most prevalent gynecological malignancies. Participation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in modulating biological behaviors of CC cells has been confirmed. However, the function of lncRNA ABHD11 antisense RNA 1 (ABHD11-AS1) in CC is still unclear. RT-qPCR and Western blot were performed for measuring RNA and protein levels. Functional assays were done to evaluate ABHD11-AS1 influences on cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration. After the verification of ABHD11-AS1 distribution in CC cells, mechanism assays were conducted to study the interaction of relative RNAs. ABHD11-AS1 expression was abnormally high in CC cells. In vitro experiments showed ABHD11-AS1 downregulation restrained CC cell malignant phenotypes. In vivo experiments proved ABHD11-AS1 knockdown impeded tumor growth. Moreover, miR-330–5p was corroborated to bind with ABHD11-AS1 in CC cells and microtubule affinity regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) was confirmed to be targeted by miR-330–5p. MiR-330–5p inhibition or MARK2 overexpression could countervail the suppressive effect of ABHD11-AS1 knockdown on CC cell malignant behaviors. We found that ABHD11-AS1 facilitated CC tumorigenesis through competitively sequestering miR-330–5p to upregulate MARK2, indicating ABHD11-AS1 as a potential biomarker in CC.

Abstract: Islet integrity plays a major role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and thus replenishment of damaged islets by differentiation of resident endocrine progenitors into neo islets regulates the islet functionality. Islet differentiation is affected by many factors including crosstalk with various organs by secretome. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) secrete a large array of factors in the extracellular milieu that exhibit regulatory effects on other tissues including pancreatic islets. The microenvironment of metabolically compromised human ADSCs (hADSCs) has a detrimental impact on islet functionality. In the present study, the role of secretome was studied on the differentiation of islets. Expression of key transcription factors like HNF–3B, NGN-3, NeuroD, PDX- 1, Maf-A, and GLUT-2 involved in development were differentially regulated in obese hADSC secretome as compared to control hADSC secretome. Islet like cell clusters (ILCCs) functionality and viability were critically hampered under obese hADSC secretome with compromised yield, morphometry, lower expression of C-peptide and Glucagon as well as higher ROS activity and cell death parameters. This study provides considerable insights on two major findings which are (i) exploring the use of hADSC secretome in islet differentiation and (ii) understanding the regulating effect of altered hADSC secretome under a metabolically compromised condition.

Abstract: The principle underlying radiotherapy is to kill cancer cells while minimizing the harmful effects on non-cancer cells, which has still remained as a major challenge. In relation, ferroptosis has recently been proposed as a novel mechanism of radiation-induced cell death. In this study, we investigated and demonstrated the role of Hemin as an iron overloading agent in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by ionizing radiation in lung cancer and non-cancer cells. It was found that the presence of Hemin in irradiated lung cancer cells enhanced the productivity of initial ROS, resulting in lipid peroxidation and subsequent ferroptosis. We observed that application of Hemin as a co-treatment increased the activity of GPx4 degradation in both cancer and normal lung cells. Furthermore, Hemin protected normal lung cells against radiation-induced cell death, in that it suppressed ROS after radiation, and boosted the production of bilirubin which was a lipophilic ROS antioxidant. In addition, we demonstrated significant FTH1 expression in normal lung cells when compared to lung cancer cells, which prevented iron from playing a role in increasing IR-induced cell death. Our findings demonstrated that Hemin had a dual function in enhancing the radiosensitivity of ferroptosis in lung cancer cells while promoting cell survival in normal lung cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian complex I can adopt catalytically active (A-) or deactive (D-) states. A defining feature of the reversible transition between these two defined states is thought to be exposure of the ND3 subunit Cys39 residue in the D-state and its occlusion in the A-state. As the catalytic A/D transition is important in health and disease, we set out to quantify it by measuring Cys39 exposure using isotopic labeling and mass spectrometry, in parallel with complex I NADH/CoQ oxidoreductase activity. To our surprise, we found significant Cys39 exposure during NADH/CoQ oxidoreductase activity. Furthermore, this activity was unaffected if Cys39 alkylation occurred during complex I-linked respiration. In contrast, alkylation of catalytically inactive complex I irreversibly blocked the reactivation of NADH/CoQ oxidoreductase activity by NADH. Thus, Cys39 of ND3 is exposed in complex I during mitochondrial respiration, with significant implications for our understanding of the A/D transition and the mechanism of complex I.

Abstract: Summary
The resurgence of yellow fever in South America has prompted vaccination against the etiologic agent, yellow fever virus (YFV). Current vaccines are based on a live-attenuated YF-17D virus derived from a virulent African isolate. The capacity of these vaccines to induce neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine strain is used as a surrogate for protection. However, the sensitivity of genetically distinct South American strains to vaccine-induced antibodies is unknown. We show that antiviral potency of the polyclonal antibody response in vaccinees is attenuated against an emergent Brazilian strain. This reduction was attributable to amino acid changes at two sites in central domain II of the glycoprotein E, including multiple changes at the domain I–domain II hinge, which are unique to and shared among most South American YFV strains. Our findings call for a reevaluation of current approaches to YFV immunological surveillance in South America and suggest approaches for updating vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) are co-regulated bacterial genes that sense nutrients and enable glycan digestion. Human gut microbiome members, notably Bacteroides, contain numerous PULs that enable glycan utilization and shape ecological dynamics. To investigate the role of PULs on fitness and inter-species interactions, we develop a CRISPR-based genome editing tool to study 23 PULs in Bacteroides uniformis (BU). BU PULs show distinct glycan-degrading functions and transcriptional coordination that enables the population to adapt upon loss of other PULs. Exploiting a BU mutant barcoding strategy, we demonstrate that in vitro fitness and BU colonization in the murine gut are enhanced by deletion of specific PULs and modulated by glycan availability. PULs mediate glycan-dependent interactions with butyrate producers that depend on the degradation mechanism and glycan utilization ability of the butyrate producer. Thus, PULs determine community dynamics and butyrate production and provide a selective advantage or disadvantage depending on the nutritional landscape.

Abstract: Summary
Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated individuals are considered a consequence of waning immunity. Serum antibodies represent the most measurable outcome of vaccine-induced B cell memory. When antibodies decline, memory B cells are expected to persist and perform their function, preventing clinical disease. We investigated whether BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces durable and functional B cell memory in vivo against SARS-CoV-2 3, 6, and 9 months after the second dose in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs). While we observed physiological decline of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, memory B cells persist and increase until 9 months after immunization. HCWs with breakthrough infections had no signs of waning immunity. In 3–4 days, memory B cells responded to SARS-CoV-2 infection by producing high levels of specific antibodies in the serum and anti-Spike IgA in the saliva. Antibodies to the viral nucleoprotein were produced with the slow kinetics typical of the response to a novel antigen.

Abstract: Summary
Taste bud cells are renewed throughout life in a process requiring innervation. Recently, we reported that R-spondin substitutes for neuronal input for taste cell regeneration. R-spondin amplifies WNT signaling by interacting with stem-cell-expressed E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 (negative regulators of WNT signaling) and G-protein-coupled receptors LGR4/5/6 (positive regulators of WNT signaling). Therefore, we hypothesized that RNF43/ZNRF3 may serve as a brake, controlled by gustatory neuron-produced R-spondin, for regulating taste tissue homeostasis. Here, we show that mice deficient for Rnf43/Znrf3 in KRT5-expressing epithelial stem/progenitor cells (RZ dKO) exhibited taste cell hyperplasia; in stark contrast, epithelial tissue on the tongue degenerated. WNT signaling blockade substantially reversed all these effects in RZ dKO mice. Furthermore, innervation becomes dispensable for taste cell renewal in RZ dKO mice. We thus demonstrate important but distinct functions of RNF43/ZNRF3 in regulating taste versus lingual epithelial tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is their exceptional ability to migrate within the extracellular matrix (ECM) for gaining access to the circulatory system, a critical step of cancer metastasis. RhoA, a small GTPase, is known to be a key molecular switch that toggles between actomyosin contractility and lamellipodial protrusion during cell migration. Current understanding of RhoA activity in cell migration has been largely derived from studies of cells plated on a two-dimensional (2D) substrate using a FRET biosensor. There has been increasing evidence that cells behave differently in a more physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) environment. However, studies of RhoA activities in 3D have been hindered by low signal-to-noise ratio in fluorescence imaging. In this paper, we present a a machine learning-assisted FRET technique to follow the spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA activities of single breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231) migrating in a 3D as well as a 2D environment. We found that RhoA activity is more polarized along the long axis of the cell for single cells migrating on 2D fibronectin-coated glass versus those embedded in 3D collagen matrices. In particular, RhoA activities of cells in 2D exhibit a distinct front-to-back and back-to-front movement during migration in contrast to those in 3D. Finally, regardless of dimensionality, RhoA polarization is found to be moderately correlated with cell shape.

Abstract: Objective
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), especially genetically modified MSCs, have become a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through modulating immune responses. However, most MSCs used in the treatment of RA are modified based on a single gene. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of human BMSCs (hBMSCs) with COX-2 silence and TGF-β3 overexpression in the treatment of RA in a rabbit model.
Materials and methods
hBMSCs were cotransfected with shCOX-2 and TGF-β3 through lentiviral vector delivery. After SPIO-Molday ION Rhodamine-B™ (MIRB) labeling, lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs, lenti-shCOX2 hBMSCs, lenti-TGF-β3 hBMSCs, hBMSCs without genetic modification, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the knee joint of rabbits with antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). The diameter of the knee joint and soft-tissue swelling score (STS) were recorded, and the levels of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were evaluated by ELISA. Clinical 3.0T MR imaging (MRI) was used to track the distribution and dynamic migration of hBMSCs in the joint. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assays were conducted to localize labeled hBMSCs and assess the alteration of synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cartilage damage.
Results
COX-2 silencing and TGF-β3 overexpression in hBMSCs were confirmed through real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Reduced joint diameter, soft-tissue swelling (STS) score, and PGE2, IL-1β, and TNF-α expression were detected 4 weeks after injection of MIRB-labeled lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs into the joint in rabbits with AIA. Eight weeks after hBMSC injection, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, improved hyperplasia of the synovial lining, recovered cartilage damage, and increased matrix staining were observed in joints injected with lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs and lenti-shCOX2 hBMSCs. Slight synovial hyperplasia, no surface fibrillation, and strong positive expression of collagen II staining in chondrocytes and cartilage matrix were detected in the joints 12 weeks after injection of lenti-shCOX2-TGF-β3 hBMSCs. In addition, hBMSCs were detected by MRI imaging throughout the process of hBMSC treatment.
Conclusion
Intra-articular injection of hBMSCs with COX-2 silence and TGFβ3 overexpression not only significantly inhibited joint inflammation and synovium hyperplasia, but also protected articular cartilage at the early stage. In addition, intra-articular injection of hBMSCs with COX-2 silence and TGFβ3 overexpression promoted chondrocyte and matrix proliferation. This study provides an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RA using genetically modified hBMSCs.

Abstract: Neural precursor cells (NPCs) transplanted into the adult neocortex generate neurons that synaptically integrate with host neurons, supporting the possibility of achieving functional tissue repair. However, poor survival and functional neuronal recovery of transplanted NPCs greatly limits engraftment. Here, we test the hypothesis that combining blood vessel-forming vascular cells with neuronal precursors improves engraftment. By transplanting mixed embryonic neocortical cells into adult mice with neocortical strokes, we show that transplant-derived neurons synapse with appropriate targets while donor vascular cells form vessels that fuse with the host vasculature to perfuse blood within the graft. Although all grafts became vascularized, larger grafts had greater contributions of donor-derived vessels that increased as a function of their distance from the host-graft border. Moreover, excluding vascular cells from the donor cell population strictly limited graft size. Thus, inclusion of vessel-forming vascular cells with NPCs is required for more efficient engraftment and ultimately for tissue repair.

Abstract: Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) endangers human health. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were proven to promote thrombolysis and miR-204-5p was discovered to be low-expressed in DVT patients. This study concentrated on exploring whether miR-204-5p had a regulatory effect on EPCs and DVT. Concretely, the expression of miR-204-5p in DVT patients’ blood was detected by qRT-PCR. The target of miR-204-5p was predicted by bioinformatics and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. After rat EPCs were isolated, identified, and transfected with miR-204-5p agomiR, antagomiR, or SPRED1 plasmids, the viability, migration, invasion, and tube formation of EPCs were detected by MTT, wound healing, Transwell, and tube formation assays, respectively. MiR-204-5p, SPRED1, p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, AKT, VEGFA, and Ang1 expressions in EPCs were measured by qRT-PCR or Western blot. EPCs transfected with miR-204-5p overexpression lentivirus plasmid were injected into the DVT rat model. The histopathology of the thrombus and the homing of EPCs to thrombus in the DVT rats were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and confocal microscopy, respectively. We found that miR-204-5p was low-expressed in DVT patients and SPRED1 was a target gene of miR-204-5p. MiR-204-5p agomiR promoted the viability, migration, invasion, and tube formation of EPCs, the levels of VEGFA and Ang1 and the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway in EPCs, while miR-204-5p antagomiR and SPRED1 worked oppositely. SPRED1 reversed the effect of miR-204-5p agomiR on EPCs. Up-regulated miR-204-5p inhibited thrombosis and promoted EPCs homing to thrombus in DVT rats. Collectively, up-regulated miR-204-5p enhanced the angiogenesis of EPCs and thrombolysis in DVT rats by targeting SPRED1.

Abstract: Cells respond to stress through adaptive mechanisms that limit cellular damage and prevent cell death. MicroRNAs act as regulators of stress responses and stress can impact the functioning of miRNA biogenesis pathways. We were interested in the effect that severe proteotoxic stress capable of inducing apoptosis may have on miRNA biogenesis and the impact of the molecular chaperone protein HSP70 under these conditions. We found that the miRNA processing enzymes Drosha and Dicer and their accessory proteins DGCR8 and TRBP2 are cleaved by caspases in apoptotic cells. Overexpression of HSP70 prevented caspase activation and the degradation of these processing proteins. Caspase cleavage of TRBP2 was mapped to amino acid 234 which separates the two dsRNA-binding domains from the C-terminal Dicer interacting domain. Overexpression of TRBP2 was found to increase miRNA maturation, while expression of either of the fragments generated by caspase cleavage impaired maturation. These results indicate that inactivation of miRNA biogenesis is a critical feature of apoptosis and that cleavage of TRBP2, rather than simply a loss of function, serves to create positive acting inhibitors of pre-miRNA maturation.

Abstract: MEL1 (MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1/PRDM16), a zinc finger protein, is located near the chromosomal breakpoint at 1p36 in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with the t (1; 3) (p36; q21) translocation. Mel1/Prdm16 is not only a causative gene of leukemia, but also has multiple regulatory functions, such as the regulation of fat metabolism. To investigate the function of Mel1/Prdm16, we generated Mel1/Prdm16-deficient mice, but homozygous deficiency (Mel1/Prdm16−/−) was embryonic lethal at E 11.5. Heterozygous mice showed abnormal cartilage and bone formation in the postnatal skull and long bones, suggesting that Mel1/Prdm16 expression plays an important role in bone development. In osteoblast and chondrocyte cell lines, Mel1/Prdm16 promotes the differentiation of chondrocytes and regulates the differentiation of osteoblasts. Transient repression of the master regulator Runx2 is required for chondrocyte differentiation at an early stage of differentiation. However, in Mel1/Prdm16-suppressed ATDC5 cells, the initial suppression of Runx2 was lacking and its expression was upregulated at the beginning of differentiation, suggesting that chondrogenic differentiation is suppressed in Mel1/Prdm16+/− mesenchymal progenitor cells because Runx2 expression is upregulated during the early stage of differentiation. Thus, the Mel1/Prdm16 gene may be involved in the early repression of Runx2 expression during osteochondral differentiation and promote chondrogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Recombinant immunoglobulin G (IgG) aggregates are formed during their production. However, the process underlying intracellular/extracellular aggregation in cell culture conditions is not well understood, and no effective method exists to assess IgG aggregates. Here, we establish an approach to detect intracellular aggregates using AF.2A1, a small artificial protein that binds to non-native IgG conformers and aggregates. Fluorescent-labeled AF.2A1 is prepared via conjugation and transfected into antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Micrographic images show intracellular IgG aggregates in CHO cells. The relative amount of intracellular aggregates (versus total intracellular IgG) differed depending on the type of additives used during cell culture. Interestingly, the relative amount of intracellular aggregates moderately correlates with that of in vitro extracellular IgG aggregates, suggesting they are secreted. This method will allow the investigation of antibody aggregation in cells, and may guide the production of therapeutic antibodies with high yield/quality.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of digestive system, and its main cause of death is tumor metastasis. The occurrence of CRC is a polygenic and multi-step complex process involving genetic and epigenetic alterations. It has been demonstrated that ADAMTS14 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 14) was hypermethylated in esophageal cancer using whole-genome methylation microarray in our previous report. The present study revealed that ADAMTS14 was highly methylated accompanied with low expression in CRC. In addition, demethylation agent 5-Aza-dC could demethylate ADAMTS14 promoter region and reactivate ADAMTS14 expression effectively in vitro. Therefore, promoter hypermethylation was probably contributed to ADAMTS14 epigenetic silencing in CRC. Furthermore, ADAMTS14 protein expression was higher at invasive tumor front than at the tumor center or other areas of tumor. Kaplan-meier survival analysis indicated that the high ADAMTS14 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, suggesting the possibility that ADAMTS14 is a promising indicator in the evaluation of CRC prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been socially and economically devastating. Despite an unprecedented research effort and available vaccines, effective therapeutics are still missing to limit severe disease and mortality. Using high-throughput screening, we identify acriflavine (ACF) as a potent papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitor. NMR titrations and a co-crystal structure confirm that acriflavine blocks the PLpro catalytic pocket in an unexpected binding mode. We show that the drug inhibits viral replication at nanomolar concentration in cellular models, in vivo in mice and ex vivo in human airway epithelia, with broad range activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses. Considering that acriflavine is an inexpensive drug approved in some countries, it may be immediately tested in clinical trials and play an important role during the current pandemic and future outbreaks.

Abstract: Summary
Toxoplasma gondii develops a latent infection in the muscle and central nervous system that acts as a reservoir for acute-stage reactivation in vulnerable patients. Little is understood about how parasites manipulate host cells during latent infection and the impact this has on survival. We show that bradyzoites impart a unique transcriptional signature on infected host cells. Many of these transcriptional changes rely on protein export and result in the suppression of type I interferon (IFN) and IFNγ signaling more so than in acute stages. Loss of the protein export component, MYR1, abrogates transcriptional remodeling and prevents suppression of IFN signaling. Among the exported proteins, the inhibitor of STAT1 transcription (IST) plays a key role in limiting IFNγ signaling in bradyzoites. Furthermore, bradyzoite protein export protects host cells from IFNγ-mediated cell death, even when export is restricted to latent stages. These findings highlight the functional importance of host manipulation in Toxoplasma’s bradyzoite stages.

Abstract: Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) can serve as an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes of cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to identify a vital eRNA signature that has prognostic value for thyroid cancer based on GTEx and TCGA screening. We downloaded gene expression data and clinical data of thyroid cancer included in the GTEx and TCGA databases and conducted data consolidation. eRNA expression data were extracted, and subjected to differential analysis and cluster analysis. Univariate Cox regression was used to screen the prognostic factors of thyroid cancer. Multivariate Cox regression was applied for prognostic risk assessment model construction, with the efficacy evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Downstream regulatory genes of candidate eRNAs were determined using correlation analysis. There were 79 differentially expressed eRNAs associated with thyroid cancer. These differentially expressed eRNAs could assign all thyroid cancer samples into three molecular subtypes, which showed a strong link to lymph node metastasis (N stage) of thyroid cancer patients. Additionally, four key eRNAs AC141930.1, NBDY, MEG3 and AP002358.1 closely related to the prognosis of thyroid cancer patients. The risk model based on the four eRNAs predicted the prognosis of thyroid cancer patients effectively. TPO, MGST2, THBS2 and SLC25A47P1 were potential downstream regulators of the four eRNAs involved in the development of thyroid cancer. Collectively, our data suggest that a four-eRNA signature consisting of AC141930.1, NBDY, MEG3 and AP002358.1 can accurately predict the prognosis of thyroid cancer patients.

Abstract: Vascular calcification (VC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and overall mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying VC have yet to be elucidated. Here, we report the role of the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36 in the process of VC in CKD. We established an in vitro VC model of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and an adenine-induced CKD mouse model. The expression of BRCC36 was significantly decreased in both the in vivo and in vitro VC models. Alizarin red staining and calcium content assays showed that BRCC36 overexpression reduced calcium deposition in the presence of calcifying medium, while the contractile protein α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was upregulated and phosphorylated β-catenin was downregulated. Cell immunofluorescence showed that BRCC36 overexpression also reduced the expression of phosphorylated β-catenin in the nucleus in the presence of calcifying medium. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation showed that BRCC36 can bind to β-catenin. These results suggest that BRCC36 can interact with β-catenin, the main effector protein of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, inhibiting the phosphorylation of β-catenin and negatively regulating the cell signalling pathway, thereby inhibiting VC. This may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of VC in the context of CKD.

Abstract: Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) plays an essential role in DNA damage response and the maintenance of genomic stability. However, the role of ATM in regulating the function of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) remains unclear. Here we report that ATM deficiency led to accumulated DNA damage and decreased DNA damage repair capacity in neural progenitor cells. Moreover, we observed ATM ablation lead to the short-term increase of proliferation of neural progenitor cells, resulting in the depletion of the NSC pool over time, and this loss of NSC quiescence resulted in accelerated cell senescence. We further apply RNA sequencing to unravel that ATM knockout significantly affected Notch signaling pathway, furthermore, notch activation inhibit the abnormal increased proliferation of ATM–/– NSCs. Taken together, these findings indicate that ATM can serve as a key regulator for the normal function of adult NSCs by maintaining their stemness and preventing cellular senescence primarily through Notch signaling pathway.

Abstract: Background
Loco-regional invasion is commonly found in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and is associated with its poor survival rate. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) has been implicated in OSCC progression, but its regulation is poorly understood.
Materials and methods
Here, one hundred twenty-seven different post-operated human oral cancer tissue samples were analyzed. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, protein expression, and MMP-2 activity and MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and TFs (NFκB, AP1, Sp1, and Twist) were observed semi-quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and gelatin zymography. In addition, OSCC derived Cal-27, SCC4/9 cells, photochemical ECGC, and MAPK-pathway inhibitor PD98059 were utilized for in vitro testing and wound healing assay.
Result
s: Increased protein and activity level of MMP-2 was detected in non-invasive (N0) and invasive (N1-3) oral tumors as compared to the control (adjacent normal) samples. MMP-2 protein and mRNA expression were positively associated with the TFs and MT1-MMP, negatively associated with TIMP-2 expression. Similarly, the MMP-2 expression/activity was related to several signal-transduction pathways like ERK1/2 and wnt-β-catenin pathways. Treatment of ECGC/MEK inhibitor (PD98059) diminished MMP-2 activity and invasion/migration potential in OSCC.
Conclusion
Our research suggests that the ERK1/2 driven overexpression/activation of MMP-2 was linked with the overall OSCC invasion and metastasis. Treatment of MEK inhibitor (PD98059) and ECGC diminished MMP-2 activity and thus could be exploited as a therapeutic strategy to control the invasive OSCC.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying cellular phosphorylation pathways based on kinase-substrate relationships is a critical step to understanding the regulation of physiological functions in cells. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics workflows have made it possible to comprehensively collect information on individual phosphorylation sites in a variety of samples. However, there is still no generic approach to uncover phosphorylation networks based on kinase-substrate relationships in rare cell populations. Here, we describe a motif-centric phosphoproteomics approach combined with multiplexed isobaric labeling, in which in vitro kinase reactions are used to generate targeted phosphopeptides, which are spiked into one of the isobaric channels to increase detectability. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate selective and comprehensive quantification of targeted phosphopeptides by using multiple kinases for motif-centric channels. More than 7,000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites were quantified from several tens of micrograms of starting materials. This approach enables the quantification of multiple phosphorylation pathways under physiological or pathological regulation in a motif-centric manner.

Abstract: Photo-functionalization of titanium orthopedic/prosthetic implants using ultraviolet illumination is known to improve osteogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the influence of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)-treated titanium surfaces on osteoblast cell adhesion, activity, and differentiation. Osteoblastic cells were cultured on titanium substrates treated with various VUV treatment conditions (0, 6.2, 18.7, and 37.4 J/cm2) and their behavior was evaluated. The results revealed that cell adhesion was increased whereas cell activity and differentiation ability were decreased upon cell culture on VUV-treated substrates. In particular, cell activity and differentiation ability were dramatically suppressed with 18.7 J/cm2 VUV irradiation. Within the limitations of this cell-based experiment, we clarified the VUV treatment conditions in which cell adhesion was improved but cell activity and differentiation ability were suppressed. These results indicate that VUV-treatment can be used to influence cell growth properties and can be used to accelerate or suppress cell differentiation on implant substrates.

Abstract: The ERK/MAPK signaling pathway is activated in various cancers including gastric cancer. Targeting the ERK/MAPK/MEK pathway has been considered as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. However, MEK inhibition leads to a series of resistance mechanisms due to mutations in MEK, elevated expression of RAS or RAF proteins and activation of the associated signaling pathways. In the present study, ERK/MAPK pathway specific gene signatures were identified to be highly activated in intestinal subtype gastric tumors. Inhibition of ERK/MAPK pathway with the inhibitor PD98059 in gastric cancer cell lines by in vitro signaling pathway and genome-wide expression profiling revealed the associated signaling pathways. Functional genomic investigation of the ERK/MAPK regulated genes reveals the association of ERK/MAPK pathway with E2F, Myc, SOX-2, TGF-β, OCT4 and Notch pathways in gastric cancer cells. Of these, E2F, Myc and SOX-2 pathways are activated in intestinal subtype gastric tumors and TGF-β, OCT4, Notch pathways are activated in diffuse subtype gastric tumors. Further, the mutational load of gastric tumors was found to have association and correlation with the activation pattern of ERK/MAPK pathways across gastric tumors. ERK/MAPK activation was also found to represent the EBV and MSI activated subtypes of gastric tumors. Identification of potent drug candidates inhibiting the ERK/MAPK and associated pathways would pave a way for developing the targeted therapeutics for a subset of gastric tumors with activated ERK/MAPK signaling cascade.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence has shown that many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) participate in the tumorigenesis, including osteosarcoma (OS). Of them, lncRNA ODRUL was previously reported to act as a possible oncogene in OS doxorubicin resistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ODRUL involved in the progression of OS still remains to be thoroughly investigated. In the current study, we reported another mechanism by which ODRUL regulates OS progression. QRT-PCR and WB were conducted to detect ODRUL, miR-6874–3p and IL-6 expression in OS tissues and cells. The Kaplan-Meier was used to assess the relevance between the expression level of miR-6874–3p and the overall survival of OS patients. Wound healing assays and Transwell assays were used to evaluate the invasion and migration of OS cells. Furthermore, the binding sites of ODRUL and IL-6 to miR-6874–3p were predicted by bioinformatics and verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. ODRUL and IL-6 were highly expressed in OS cells and tissues, while miR-6874–3p was expressed at low levels. The overall survival of high miR-6874–3p expression of OS patients was longer than that of low miR-6874–3p expression of OS patients. MiR-6874–3p overexpression markedly inhibited the progression of OS cells. Both ODRUL and IL-6 could bind to miR-6874–3p at the predicted binding sites which were authenticated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. MiR-6874–3p could inhibit OS cell proliferation and metastasis and ODRUL could reverse the suppression induced by miR-6874–3p in vivo. In conclusion, ODRUL could effectively sponge miR-6874–3p to upregulate the expression of IL-6 in OS progression.

Abstract: Septic arthritis induced by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) causes irreversible cartilage degradation and subsequent permanent joint dysfunction. Recently, cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis is recognized to be associated with metabolic disorders. However, whether cholesterol metabolism is linked to septic arthritis pathology remains largely unknown. Here, we found that exposure to fermentation supernatant (FS) of S. aureus in chondrocytes resulted in a significant increase in expression of key modulators involved in cholesterol metabolism, including lectin-type oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX1), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), 25- hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) as well as retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα), a binding receptor for cholesterol metabolites. We further demonstrated that enhancement of CH25H/CYP7B1/RORα axis resulted from FS exposure was mediated by activation of NF-κB signaling, along with upregulation in catabolic factors including matrix metallopeptidases (MMP3 and MMP13), aggrecanase-2 (ADAMTS5), and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2) in chondrocytes. Exogenous cholesterol acts synergistically with FS in activating NF-κB pathway and increases cholesterol metabolism. While, the addition of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) which promotes cholesterol efflux, resulted in remarkable reduction of intracellular cholesterol level and restoration of balance between anabolism and catabolism in FS treated chondrocytes. Collectively, our data indicated that, in response to FS of S. aureus, NF-κB signaling activation coupled with increased cholesterol metabolism to stimulate catabolic factors in chondrocytes, highlighting cholesterol metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for treating septic arthritis.

Abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of fish collagen peptides (FCP) from the skin of great hammerhead shark (Sphyrna mokarran) to avert the occurrence of gastric ulcer in experimental rats. FCP treatment prevented the formation of ulcerative lesions on gastric tissues with 86% of inhibition. The histopathology analysis of gastric tissue revealed that the FCP intake prevented the occurrence of hemorrhage and erosion in gastric tissue with formation of mild edema and necrosis, as well as normalized the pH and volume of gastric juice. It also downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory marker interferon-ɤ (IFN-ɤ) and upregulated the anti-inflammatory marker interleukin-4 (IL-4) in gastric tissue. FCP is capable to modulate the oxidative stress by enhancing the activity of antioxidant defense enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase and by lowering the levels of membrane lipid peroxidation.

Abstract: Summary
Alpha-B.1.1.7, Beta-B.1.351, Gamma-P.1, and Delta-B.1.617.2 variants of SARS-CoV-2 express multiple mutations in the spike protein (S). These may alter the antigenic structure of S, causing escape from natural or vaccine-induced immunity. Beta is particularly difficult to neutralize using serum induced by early pandemic SARS-CoV-2 strains and is most antigenically separated from Delta. To understand this, we generated 674 mAbs from Beta-infected individuals and performed a detailed structure-function analysis of the 27 most potent mAbs: one binding the spike N-terminal domain (NTD), the rest the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Two of these RBD-binding mAbs recognize a neutralizing epitope conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, while 18 target mutated residues in Beta: K417N, E484K, and N501Y. There is a major response to N501Y, including a public IgVH4-39 sequence, with E484K and K417N also targeted. Recognition of these key residues underscores why serum from Beta cases poorly neutralizes early pandemic and Delta viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Transplantation in Parkinson's disease using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons is a promising future treatment option. However, many of the mechanisms that govern their differentiation, maturation, and integration into the host circuitry remain elusive. Here, we engrafted hESCs differentiated toward a ventral midbrain DA phenotype into the midbrain of a preclinical rodent model of Parkinson's disease. We then injected a novel DA-neurotropic retrograde MNM008 adeno-associated virus vector capsid, into specific DA target regions to generate starter cells based on their axonal projections. Using monosynaptic rabies-based tracing, we demonstrated for the first time that grafted hESC-derived DA neurons receive distinctly different afferent inputs depending on their projections. The similarities to the host DA system suggest a previously unknown directed circuit integration. By evaluating the differential host-to-graft connectivity based on projection patterns, this novel approach offers a tool to answer outstanding questions regarding the integration of grafted hESC-derived DA neurons.

Abstract: Summary
SMIP004-7 is a small molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration with selective in vivo anti-cancer activity through an as-yet unknown molecular target. We demonstrate here that SMIP004-7 targets drug-resistant cancer cells with stem-like features by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, complex I [CI]). Instead of affecting the quinone-binding site targeted by most CI inhibitors, SMIP004-7 and its cytochrome P450-dependent activated metabolite(s) have an uncompetitive mechanism of inhibition involving a distinct N-terminal region of catalytic subunit NDUFS2 that leads to rapid disassembly of CI. SMIP004-7 and an improved chemical analog selectively engage NDUFS2 in vivo to inhibit the growth of triple-negative breast cancer transplants, a response mediated at least in part by boosting CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated immune surveillance. Thus, SMIP004-7 defines an emerging class of ubiquinone uncompetitive CI inhibitors for cell autonomous and microenvironmental metabolic targeting of mitochondrial respiration in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
β-Lactam antibiotics disrupt the assembly of peptidoglycan (PG) within the bacterial cell wall by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). It was recently shown that β-lactam treatment initializes a futile cycle of PG synthesis and degradation, highlighting major gaps in our understanding of the lethal effects of PBP inhibition by β-lactam antibiotics. Here, we assess the downstream metabolic consequences of treatment of Escherichia coli with the β-lactam mecillinam and show that lethality from PBP2 inhibition is a specific consequence of toxic metabolic shifts induced by energy demand from multiple catabolic and anabolic processes, including accelerated protein synthesis downstream of PG futile cycling. Resource allocation into these processes is coincident with alterations in ATP synthesis and utilization, as well as a broadly dysregulated cellular redox environment. These results indicate that the disruption of normal anabolic-catabolic homeostasis by PBP inhibition is an essential factor for β-lactam antibiotic lethality.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells exacerbates mouse models of autoimmunity, but how human-associated bacteria impact Th17-driven disease remains elusive. We show that human gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta induces intestinal Th17 activation by lifting inhibition of the Th17 transcription factor Rorγt through cell- and antigen-independent mechanisms. E. lenta is enriched in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and worsens colitis in a Rorc-dependent manner in mice. Th17 activation varies across E. lenta strains, which is attributable to the cardiac glycoside reductase 2 (Cgr2) enzyme. Cgr2 is sufficient to induce interleukin (IL)-17a, a major Th17 cytokine. cgr2+ E. lenta deplete putative steroidal glycosides in pure culture; related compounds are negatively associated with human IBD severity. Finally, leveraging the sensitivity of Cgr2 to dietary arginine, we prevented E. lenta-induced intestinal inflammation in mice. Together, these results support a role for human gut bacterial metabolism in driving Th17-dependent autoimmunity.

Abstract: Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide with high incidence and mortality. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to affect human cancer progression. The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory role and mechanism of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1232 (LINC01232) in NSCLC cells. RT-qPCR results revealed that LINC01232 expression was high in NSCLC cells. Flow cytometry and sphere formation assays indicated that LINC01232 significantly promoted NSCLC cell stemness. Luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay validated that forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) could bind to LINC01232 promoter and activate LINC01232 transcription. Further, LINC01232 was certified to activate TGF-β signaling pathway through regulating transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1). After RIP and RNA pull down assays, insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) was proven as the RNA-binding protein (RBP) for LINC01232. LINC01232 promoted TGFBR1 mRNA stability via recruiting IGF2BP2. Subsequently, LINC01232 was verified to accelerate NSCLC cell stemness and induce macrophage M2 polarization via upregulating TGFBR1. Taken together, FOXP3 activated-LINC01232 accelerated NSCLC cell stemness by activating TGF-β signaling pathway and recruiting IGF2BP2 to stabilize TGFBR1, which might offer a rationale for lncRNA-based treatment to NSCLC.
