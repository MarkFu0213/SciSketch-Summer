Abstract: Summary
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors have essential roles in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Previously, we identified an evolutionarily conserved protein, NRAP-1, that is required for NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function in C. elegans. Here, we demonstrate that NRAP-1 was sufficient to gate NMDARs and greatly enhanced glutamate-mediated NMDAR gating, thus conferring coincident activation properties to the NMDAR. Intriguingly, vertebrate NMDARs—and chimeric NMDARs where the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of C. elegans NMDARs was replaced by the ATD from vertebrate receptors—were spontaneously active when ectopically expressed in C. elegans neurons. Thus, the ATD is a primary determinant of NRAP-1- and glutamate-mediated gating of NMDARs. We determined the crystal structure of NRAP-1 at 1.9-Å resolution, which revealed two distinct domains positioned around a central low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain. The NRAP-1 structure, combined with chimeric and mutational analyses, suggests a model where the three NRAP-1 domains work cooperatively to modify the gating of NMDARs.

Abstract: Summary
Rescuing stalled ribosomes often involves their splitting into subunits. In many bacteria, the resultant large subunits bearing peptidyl-tRNAs are processed by the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) apparatus that extends the C termini of the incomplete nascent polypeptides with polyalanine tails to facilitate their degradation. Although the tailing mechanism is well established, it is unclear how the nascent polypeptides are cleaved off the tRNAs. We show that peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth), the known role of which has been to hydrolyze ribosome-free peptidyl-tRNA, acts in concert with RQC factors to release nascent polypeptides from large ribosomal subunits. Dislodging from the ribosomal catalytic center is required for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis by Pth. Nascent protein folding may prevent peptidyl-tRNA retraction and interfere with the peptide release. However, oligoalanine tailing makes the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond accessible for Pth-catalyzed hydrolysis. Therefore, the oligoalanine tail serves not only as a degron but also as a facilitator of Pth-catalyzed peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis.

Abstract: Ovarium torsion is a gynecological emergency that is common in women of reproductive age and requires early diagnosis and intervention. In this study, we aimed to investigate the long-term anatomical, histological and biochemical protective effects of lamotrigine in ovariums in the ischemia – reperfusion (I–R) model created experimentally in rats. A total of 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 14 weeks old, weighing 220–270 g were used in the study. The subjects were randomly distributed to form 4 groups named SHAM group, I - R group, I - R + Lamotrigine (LTG) group and R + LTG group. Under general anesthesia, the ovaries of the rats were reached and ischemia was created for 3 h with vascular clamps. 20 mg / kg LTG was administered intraperitoneally (ip.) to group 3 30 min before ischemia and to group 4 30 min before reperfusion. At the third hour of ischemia, the vascular clamps were opened and the abdomen of the rats was closed according to the surgical procedure. The rats were followed up for 28 days postoperatively and the ovarium tissues taken on the 28th day were examined anatomically and histologically. Biochemically, estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels were measured from blood samples taken from their hearts. Granulosa cells with diffuse vaculations were observed in degenerative follicles in group I-R. Again in this group, severe hemorrhage, fibrosis and edematous areas were observed in the ovarium stroma (Ovarian Histopathological Scoring (OHS): 7). In the I - R + LTG group, OHS was statistically significantly lower than the I - R group (OHS: 2; p < 0.000). In the R + LTG group, although the OHS score was calculated to be lower than the I - R group, there was no statistically significant difference (OHS: 6; p > 0.05). The protective effect of LTG against experimentally created ischemia and reperfusion damage was determined anatomically and histologically. No protective effect of LTG was observed in terms of FSH, E2 and AMH values measured from the blood sera of rats. These findings may provide a basis for future studies using LTG to treat ovarian ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Abstract: Summary
The period between “successful” treatment of localized breast cancer and the onset of distant metastasis can last many years, representing an unexploited window to eradicate disseminated disease and prevent metastases. We find that the source of recurrence—disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) —evade endogenous immunity directed against tumor neoantigens. Although DTCs downregulate major histocompatibility complex I, this does not preclude recognition by conventional T cells. Instead, the scarcity of interactions between two relatively rare populations—DTCs and endogenous antigen-specific T cells—underlies DTC persistence. This scarcity is overcome by any one of three immunotherapies that increase the number of tumor-specific T cells: T cell-based vaccination, or adoptive transfer of T cell receptor or chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Each approach achieves robust DTC elimination, motivating discovery of MHC-restricted and -unrestricted DTC antigens that can be targeted with T cell-based immunotherapies to eliminate the reservoir of metastasis-initiating cells in patients.

Scutellarin alleviates tensile stress-induced proliferation and migration of venous smooth muscle cells via mediating the p38 MAPK pathway,

Abstract: Objective
Abnormal proliferation and migration of biomechanical force-induced venous smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a major cause to limit the efficacy of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for coronary heart disease (CHD). Scutellarin is the main active ingredient of Erigeron Breviscapus, and has broad-spectrum pharmacological effects. Therefore, the present study was proposed to investigate the effect of Scutellarin on VSMCs under tensile stress.
Methods
After interfering with VSMCs at different tensile stresses, the optimal tensile stress was screened. In a tensile stress environment, 100 μM Scutellarin and Hesperetin (p38 MAPK pathway activator) was used to treatment with VSMCs. CCK-8, EDU, Wound healing, flow cytometry and western blotting assays were used to detect cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Caspase3, Bcl2 and Bax).
Results
Tensile stress with 10% significantly enhanced the activity, wound-healing ratio, and EDU+ cells of VSMCs, and decreased their apoptosis ratio. Moreover, it upregulated Bcl2 expression, and downregulated cleaved-Caspase3 and Bax expression of VSMCs. Hence, 10% tensile stress was selected to creates a tensile stress environment for VSMCs. Interestingly, 100 μM Scutellarin alleviated the effect of 10% tensile stress on the phenotype of VSMCs. Notably, 10% tensile stress increased the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK (Thr180 +Tyr182) in VSMCs, which was restricted by Scutellarin. Further, Hesperetin restored the effect of Scutellarin on the phenotype of VSMCs.
Conclusion
Scutellarin alleviates tension stress-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs via suppressing p38 MAPK pathway. Scutellarin may be used as an adjunctive strategy for future GABG treatment in CHD patients.

Abstract: Summary
Myopia is characterized of maladaptive increases in scleral fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (FMT). Scleral hypoxia is a significant factor contributing to myopia, but how hypoxia induces myopia is poorly understood. Here, we showed that myopia in mice and guinea pigs was associated with hypoxia-induced increases in key glycolytic enzymes expression and lactate levels in the sclera. Promotion of scleral glycolysis or lactate production induced FMT and myopia; conversely, suppression of glycolysis or lactate production eliminated or inhibited FMT and myopia. Mechanistically, increasing scleral glycolysis-lactate levels promoted FMT and myopia via H3K18la, and this promoted Notch1 expression. Genetic analyses identified a significant enrichment of two genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, ENO2 and TPI1. Moreover, increasing sugar intake in guinea pigs not only induced myopia but also enhanced the response to myopia induction via the scleral glycolysis-lactate-histone lactylation pathway. Collectively, we suggest that scleral glycolysis contributes to myopia by promoting FMT via lactate-induced histone lactylation.

Abstract: Summary
Neural activity in the claustrum has been associated with a range of vigilance states, yet the activity patterns and efficacy of synaptic communication of identified claustrum neurons have not been thoroughly determined. Here, we show that claustrum neurons projecting to the retrosplenial cortex are most active during synchronized cortical states such as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are suppressed during increased cortical desynchronization associated with arousal, movement, and REM sleep. The efficacy of claustrocortical signaling is increased during NREM and diminished during movement due in part to increased cholinergic tone. Finally, claustrum activation during NREM sleep enhances memory consolidation through the phase resetting of cortical delta waves. Therefore, claustrocortical communication is constrained to function most effectively during cognitive processes associated with synchronized cortical states, such as memory consolidation.

Abstract: Summary
Progression of prostate cancer depends on androgen receptor, which is usually activated by androgens. Therefore, a mainstay treatment is androgen deprivation therapy. Unfortunately, despite initial treatment response, resistance nearly always develops, and disease progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which remains driven by non-gonadal androgens synthesized in prostate cancer tissues. 3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-->4 isomerase 1 (3βHSD1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in androgen synthesis. However, how 3βHSD1, especially the “adrenal-permissive” 3βHSD1(367T) that permits tumor synthesis of androgen from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), is regulated at the protein level is not well understood. Here, we investigate how hypoxia regulates 3βHSD1(367T) protein levels. Our results show that, in vitro, hypoxia stabilizes 3βHSD1 protein by suppressing autophagy. Autophagy inhibition promotes 3βHSD1-dependent tumor progression. Hypoxia represses transcription of autophagy-related (ATG) genes by decreasing histone acetylation. Inhibiting deacetylase (HDAC) restores ATG gene transcription under hypoxia. Therefore, HDAC inhibition may be a therapeutic target for hypoxic tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
During organ formation, progenitor cells need to acquire different cell identities and organize themselves into distinct structural units. How these processes are coordinated and how tissue architecture(s) is preserved despite the dramatic cell rearrangements occurring in developing organs remain unclear. Here, we identified cellular rearrangements between acinar and ductal progenitors as a mechanism to drive branching morphogenesis in the pancreas while preserving the integrity of the acinar-ductal functional unit. Using ex vivo and in vivo mouse models, we found that pancreatic ductal cells form clefts by protruding and pulling on the acinar basement membrane, which leads to acini splitting. Newly formed acini remain connected to the bifurcated branches generated by ductal cell rearrangement. Insulin growth factor (IGF)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway finely regulates this process by controlling pancreatic ductal tissue fluidity, with a simultaneous impact on branching and cell fate acquisition. Together, our results explain how acinar structure multiplication and branch bifurcation are synchronized during pancreas organogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are Ca2+ stores mobilized by the second messengers NAADP and IP3, respectively. Here, we establish Ca2+ signals between the two sources as fundamental building blocks that couple local release to global changes in Ca2+. Cell-wide Ca2+ signals evoked by activation of endogenous NAADP-sensitive channels on lysosomes comprise both local and global components and exhibit a major dependence on ER Ca2+ despite their lysosomal origin. Knockout of ER IP3 receptor channels delays these signals, whereas expression of lysosomal TPC2 channels accelerates them. High-resolution Ca2+ imaging reveals elementary events upon TPC2 opening and signals coupled to IP3 receptors. Biasing TPC2 activation to a Ca2+-permeable state sensitizes local Ca2+ signals to IP3. This increases the potency of a physiological agonist to evoke global Ca2+ signals and activate a downstream target. Our data provide a conceptual framework to understand how Ca2+ release from physically separated stores is coordinated.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are implicated as primarily detrimental in pain models; however, they exist across a continuum of states that contribute to homeostasis or pathology depending on timing and context. To clarify the specific contribution of microglia to pain progression, we take advantage of a temporally controlled transgenic approach to transiently deplete microglia. Unexpectedly, we observe complete resolution of pain coinciding with microglial repopulation rather than depletion. We find that repopulated mouse spinal cord microglia are morphologically distinct from control microglia and exhibit a unique transcriptome. Repopulated microglia from males and females express overlapping networks of genes related to phagocytosis and response to stress. We intersect the identified mouse genes with a single-nuclei microglial dataset from human spinal cord to identify human-relevant genes that may ultimately promote pain resolution after injury. This work presents a comprehensive approach to gene discovery in pain and provides datasets for the development of future microglial-targeted therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the symmetrical structure of nucleosomes, in vitro studies have shown that transcription proceeds with different efficiency depending on the orientation of the DNA sequence around them. However, it is unclear whether this functional asymmetry is present in vivo and whether it could regulate transcriptional directionality. Here, we report that the proximal and distal halves of nucleosomal DNA contribute differentially to nucleosome stability in the genome. In +1 nucleosomes, this asymmetry facilitates or hinders transcription depending on the orientation of its underlying DNA, and this difference is associated with an asymmetrical interaction between DNA and histones. These properties are encoded in the DNA signature of +1 nucleosomes, since its incorporation in the two orientations into downstream nucleosomes renders them asymmetrically accessible to MNase and inverts the balance between sense and antisense transcription. Altogether, our results show that nucleosomal DNA endows nucleosomes with asymmetrical properties that modulate the directionality of transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) have remarkable efficacy in liquid tumors, but limited responses in solid tumors. We conducted a Phase I trial (NCT02107963) of GD2 CAR-Ts (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.iC9), demonstrating feasibility and safety of administration in children and young adults with osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma. Since CAR-T efficacy requires adequate CAR-T expansion, patients were grouped into good or poor expanders across dose levels. Patient samples were evaluated by multi-dimensional proteomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic analyses. T cell assessments identified naive T cells in pre-treatment apheresis associated with good expansion, and exhausted T cells in CAR-T products with poor expansion. Myeloid cell assessment identified CXCR3+ monocytes in pre-treatment apheresis associated with good expansion. Longitudinal analysis of post-treatment samples identified increased CXCR3– classical monocytes in all groups as CAR-T numbers waned. Together, our data uncover mediators of CAR-T biology and correlates of expansion that could be utilized to advance immunotherapies for solid tumor patients.

Abstract: Summary
Despite advances in treatment, lung cancer survival rates remain low. A better understanding of the cellular heterogeneity and interplay of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor microenvironment will support the development of personalized therapies. We report a spatially resolved single-cell imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analysis of CAFs in a non-small cell lung cancer cohort of 1,070 patients. We identify four prognostic patient groups based on 11 CAF phenotypes with distinct spatial distributions and show that CAFs are independent prognostic factors for patient survival. The presence of tumor-like CAFs is strongly correlated with poor prognosis. In contrast, inflammatory CAFs and interferon-response CAFs are associated with inflamed tumor microenvironments and higher patient survival. High density of matrix CAFs is correlated with low immune infiltration and is negatively correlated with patient survival. In summary, our data identify phenotypic and spatial features of CAFs that are associated with patient outcome in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Common genetic variants in glucokinase regulator (GCKR), which encodes GKRP, a regulator of hepatic glucokinase (GCK), influence multiple metabolic traits in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), making GCKR one of the most pleiotropic GWAS loci in the genome. It is unclear why. Prior work has demonstrated that GCKR influences the hepatic cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, also referred to as reductive stress. Here, we demonstrate that reductive stress is sufficient to activate the transcription factor ChREBP and necessary for its activation by the GKRP-GCK interaction, glucose, and ethanol. We show that hepatic reductive stress induces GCKR GWAS traits such as increased hepatic fat, circulating FGF21, and circulating acylglycerol species, which are also influenced by ChREBP. We define the transcriptional signature of hepatic reductive stress and show its upregulation in fatty liver disease and downregulation after bariatric surgery in humans. These findings highlight how a GCKR-reductive stress-ChREBP axis influences multiple human metabolic traits.

Abstract: Coenzyme Q10 (KQ10) and curcumin (KUR) supplements are extensively used for their potential antioxidant, anticancer, and antiapoptotic properties. The present study investigated the neuroprotective potential of KQ10 and KUR against the side effect of cyclophosphamide (SF) (150 mg/kg) on the hippocampus of male Wistar albino rats. Forty-nine 10–12 weeks old rats were randomly divided into seven groups: control, olive oil (OL), SF, KQ10, KUR, SF+KQ10, and SF+KUR. Our biochemical finding showed a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) level in the SF group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). There was also a significant reduction in the total number of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the CA1, CA2, and CA1–3 regions in the SF group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In the SF+KQ10 group, we found a significant increase in serum SOD level and the total number of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the CA1, CA2, and CA1–3 regions compared to the SF group (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical and histopathological examination exhibited noteworthy findings in the hippocampus tissues. Our findings showed that KQ10 administration significantly mitigated the hippocampal alteration caused by SF through enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing apoptosis. However, we found no protective activity of KUR on the hippocampus tissue, which may be due to its weak antioxidative activity.

Abstract: Summary
The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is hampered by relapse in hematologic malignancies and by hyporesponsiveness in solid tumors. Long-lived memory CAR T cells are critical for improving tumor clearance and long-term protection. However, during rapid ex vivo expansion or in vivo tumor eradication, metabolic shifts and inhibitory signals lead to terminal differentiation and exhaustion of CAR T cells. Through a mitochondria-related compound screening, we find that the FDA-approved isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) inhibitor enasidenib enhances memory CAR T cell formation and sustains anti-leukemic cytotoxicity in vivo. Mechanistically, IDH2 impedes metabolic fitness of CAR T cells by restraining glucose utilization via the pentose phosphate pathway, which alleviates oxidative stress, particularly in nutrient-restricted conditions. In addition, IDH2 limits cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels to prevent histone acetylation that promotes memory cell formation. In combination with pharmacological IDH2 inhibition, CAR T cell therapy is demonstrated to have superior efficacy in a pre-clinical model.

Abstract: Summary
iRhoms are pseudoprotease members of the rhomboid-like superfamily and are cardinal regulators of inflammatory and growth factor signaling; they function primarily by recognizing transmembrane domains of their clients. Here, we report a mechanistically distinct nuclear function of iRhoms, showing that both human and mouse iRhom2 are non-canonical substrates of signal peptidase complex (SPC), the protease that removes signal peptides from secreted proteins. Cleavage of iRhom2 generates an N-terminal fragment that enters the nucleus and modifies the transcriptome, in part by binding C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs). The biological significance of nuclear iRhom2 is indicated by elevated levels in skin biopsies of patients with psoriasis, tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC), and non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (NEPPK); increased iRhom2 cleavage in a keratinocyte model of psoriasis; and nuclear iRhom2 promoting proliferation of keratinocytes. Overall, this work identifies an unexpected SPC-dependent ER-to-nucleus signaling pathway and demonstrates that iRhoms can mediate nuclear signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Poor skin wound healing, which is common in patients with diabetes, is related to imbalanced macrophage polarization. Here, we find that nutrition sensor GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) and its downstream are significantly upregulated in human skin wound tissue and mouse skin wound macrophages, but skin wound-related GCN2 expression and activity are significantly downregulated by diabetes and hyperglycemia. Using wound healing models of GCN2-deleted mice, bone marrow chimeric mice, and monocyte-transferred mice, we show that GCN2 deletion in macrophages significantly delays skin wound healing compared with wild-type mice by altering M1 and M2a/M2c polarization. Mechanistically, GCN2 inhibits M1 macrophages via OXPHOS-ROS-NF-κB pathway and promotes tissue-repairing M2a/M2c macrophages through eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α)-hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)-glycolysis pathway. Importantly, local supplementation of GCN2 activator halofuginone efficiently restores wound healing in diabetic mice with re-balancing M1 and M2a/2c polarization. Thus, the decreased macrophage GCN2 expression and activity contribute to poor wound healing in diabetes and targeting GCN2 improves wound healing in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Cell corpse removal is a critical component of both development and homeostasis throughout the animal kingdom. Extensive research has revealed many of the mechanisms involved in corpse removal, typically involving engulfment and digestion by another cell; however, the dynamics of cell corpse clearance in adult tissues remain unclear. Here, we track cell death in the adult planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and find that, following light-induced cell death, pigment cell corpses transit to the gut and are excreted from the animal. Gut phagocytes, previously only known to phagocytose food, are required for pigment cells to enter the gut lumen. Finally, we show that the planarian ortholog of ced-12/engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) is required for corpse phagocytosis and removal through the gut. In total, we present a mechanism of cell clearance in an adult organism involving transit of dead cells to the gut, transport into the gut by phagocytes, and physical excretion of debris.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear mRNA export via nuclear pore complexes is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. Although factors involved in mRNA transport have been characterized, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of this process and its regulation is lacking. Here, we use single-RNA imaging in yeast to show that cells use mRNA retention to control mRNA export during stress. We demonstrate that, upon glucose withdrawal, the essential RNA-binding factor Nab2 forms RNA-dependent condensate-like structures in the nucleus. This coincides with a reduced abundance of the DEAD-box ATPase Dbp5 at the nuclear pore. Depleting Dbp5, and consequently blocking mRNA export, is necessary and sufficient to trigger Nab2 condensation. The state of Nab2 condensation influences the extent of nuclear mRNA accumulation and can be recapitulated in vitro, where Nab2 forms RNA-dependent liquid droplets. We hypothesize that cells use condensation to regulate mRNA export and control gene expression during stress.

Abstract: Summary
Investigating immune memory to vaccinia virus and pre-existing immunity to mpox virus (MPXV) among the population is crucial for the global response to this ongoing mpox epidemic. Blood was sampled from vaccinees inoculated with vaccinia virus Tiantan (VTT) strain born before 1981 and unvaccinated control subjects born since 1982. After at least 40 years of the inoculation, 60% or 5% VTT vaccinees possess neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to VTT or MPXV, with at least 50% having T cell memory to VTT protein antigens. Notably, 46.7% vaccinees show pre-existing T cell responses to MPXV. Broad pre-existing CD8+ T cell reactivities to MPXV are detected not only against conserved epitopes but also against variant epitopes between VTT and MPXV. Persistent NAbs and T cell memory to VTT among vaccinees, along with pre-existing T cells to MPXV among both vaccinees and the unvaccinated population, indicate a particular immune barrier to mpox.

Abstract: Summary
Organ size is controlled by numerous factors including mechanical forces, which are mediated in part by the Hippo pathway. In growing Drosophila epithelial tissues, cytoskeletal tension influences Hippo signaling by modulating the localization of key pathway proteins to different apical domains. Here, we discovered a Hippo signaling hub at basal spot junctions, which form at the basal-most point of the lateral membranes and resemble adherens junctions in protein composition. Basal spot junctions recruit the central kinase Warts via Ajuba and E-cadherin, which prevent Warts activation by segregating it from upstream Hippo pathway proteins. Basal spot junctions are prominent when tissues undergo morphogenesis and are highly sensitive to fluctuations in cytoskeletal tension. They are distinct from focal adhesions, but the latter profoundly influences basal spot junction abundance by modulating the basal-medial actomyosin network and tension experienced by spot junctions. Thus, basal spot junctions couple morphogenetic forces to Hippo pathway activity and organ growth.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy composed of distinct transcriptional subtypes, but implementing subtyping in the clinic has remained challenging, particularly due to limited tissue availability. Given the known epigenetic regulation of critical SCLC transcriptional programs, we hypothesized that subtype-specific patterns of DNA methylation could be detected in tumor or blood from SCLC patients. Using genomic-wide reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) in two cohorts totaling 179 SCLC patients and using machine learning approaches, we report a highly accurate DNA methylation-based classifier (SCLC-DMC) that can distinguish SCLC subtypes. We further adjust the classifier for circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) to subtype SCLC from plasma. Using the cfDNA classifier (cfDMC), we demonstrate that SCLC phenotypes can evolve during disease progression, highlighting the need for longitudinal tracking of SCLC during clinical treatment. These data establish that tumor and cfDNA methylation can be used to identify SCLC subtypes and might guide precision SCLC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is a debilitating, multisystemic disease caused by the depletion of frataxin (FXN), a mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis factor. To understand the cellular pathogenesis of FA, we performed quantitative proteomics in FXN-deficient human cells. Nearly every annotated Fe-S cluster-containing protein was depleted, indicating that as a rule, cluster binding confers stability to Fe-S proteins. We also observed depletion of a small mitoribosomal assembly factor METTL17 and evidence of impaired mitochondrial translation. Using comparative sequence analysis, mutagenesis, biochemistry, and cryoelectron microscopy, we show that METTL17 binds to the mitoribosomal small subunit during late assembly and harbors a previously unrecognized [Fe4S4]2+ cluster required for its stability. METTL17 overexpression rescued the mitochondrial translation and bioenergetic defects, but not the cellular growth, of FXN-depleted cells. These findings suggest that METTL17 acts as an Fe-S cluster checkpoint, promoting translation of Fe-S cluster-rich oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins only when Fe-S cofactors are replete.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholemman (PLM) regulates the cardiac sodium pump: PLM phosphorylation activates the pump whereas PLM palmitoylation inhibits its activity. Here, we show that the anti-oxidant protein peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) interacts with and depalmitoylates PLM in a glutathione-dependent manner. Glutathione loading cells acutely reduce PLM palmitoylation; glutathione depletion significantly increases PLM palmitoylation. Prdx6 silencing abolishes these effects, suggesting that PLM can be depalmitoylated by reduced Prdx6. In vitro, only recombinant Prdx6, among several peroxiredoxin isoforms tested, removes palmitic acid from recombinant palmitoylated PLM. The broad-spectrum depalmitoylase inhibitor palmostatin B prevents Prdx6-dependent PLM depalmitoylation in cells and in vitro. Our data suggest that Prdx6 is a thioesterase that can depalmitoylate proteins by nucleophilic attack via its reactive thiol, linking PLM palmitoylation and hence sodium pump activity to cellular glutathione status. We show that protein depalmitoylation can occur via a catalytic cysteine in which substrate specificity is determined by a protein-protein interaction.

Abstract: Summary
Machine learning-guided protein engineering is rapidly progressing; however, collecting high-quality, large datasets remains a bottleneck. Directed evolution and protein engineering studies often require extensive experimental processes to eliminate noise and label protein sequence-function data. Meta learning has proven effective in other fields in learning from noisy data via bi-level optimization given the availability of a small dataset with trusted labels. Here, we leverage meta learning approaches to overcome noisy and under-labeled data and expedite workflows in antibody engineering. We generate yeast display antibody mutagenesis libraries and screen them for target antigen binding followed by deep sequencing. We then create representative learning tasks, including learning from noisy training data, positive and unlabeled learning, and learning out of distribution properties. We demonstrate that meta learning has the potential to reduce experimental screening time and improve the robustness of machine learning models by training with noisy and under-labeled training data.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal protein synthesis is required for long-lasting plasticity and long-term memory consolidation. Dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α is one of the key translational control events that is required to increase de novo protein synthesis that underlies long-lasting plasticity and memory consolidation. Here, we interrogate the molecular pathways of translational control that are triggered by neuronal stimulation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) dephosphorylation and increases in de novo protein synthesis. Primary rodent neurons exposed to BDNF display elevated translation of GADD34, which facilitates eIF2α dephosphorylation and subsequent de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, GADD34 requires G-actin generated by cofilin to dephosphorylate eIF2α and enhance protein synthesis. Finally, GADD34 is required for BDNF-induced translation of synaptic plasticity-related proteins. Overall, we provide evidence that neurons repurpose GADD34, an effector of the integrated stress response, as an orchestrator of rapid increases in eIF2-dependent translation in response to plasticity-inducing stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the remarkable success of anti-cancer immunotherapy, its effectiveness remains confined to a subset of patients—emphasizing the importance of predictive biomarkers in clinical decision-making and further mechanistic understanding of treatment response. Current biomarkers, however, lack the power required to accurately stratify patients. Here, we identify interferon-stimulated, Ly6Ehi neutrophils as a blood-borne biomarker of anti-PD1 response in mice at baseline. Ly6Ehi neutrophils are induced by tumor-intrinsic activation of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway and possess the ability to directly sensitize otherwise non-responsive tumors to anti-PD1 therapy, in part through IL12b-dependent activation of cytotoxic T cells. By translating our pre-clinical findings to a cohort of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma (n = 109), and to public data (n = 1440), we demonstrate the ability of Ly6Ehi neutrophils to predict immunotherapy response in humans with high accuracy (average AUC ≈ 0.9). Overall, our study identifies a functionally active biomarker for use in both mice and humans.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription coactivators are proteins or protein complexes that mediate transcription factor (TF) function. However, they lack DNA-binding capacity, prompting the question of how they engage target loci. Three non-exclusive hypotheses have been posited: coactivators are recruited by complexing with TFs, by binding histones through epigenetic reader domains, or by partitioning into condensates through their extensive intrinsically disordered regions. Using p300 as a prototypical coactivator, we systematically mutated its annotated domains and show by single-molecule tracking in live U2OS cells that coactivator-chromatin binding depends entirely on combinatorial binding of multiple TF-interaction domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that acetyltransferase activity opposes p300-chromatin association and that the N-terminal TF-interaction domains regulate that activity. Single TF-interaction domains are insufficient for chromatin binding and regulation of catalytic activity, implying a principle that we speculate could broadly apply to eukaryotic gene regulation: a TF must act in coordination with other TFs to recruit coactivator activity.

Abstract: Several trace metals, including iron, copper, manganese and zinc are essential for normal function of the nervous system. Both deficiency and excessive accumulation of these metals trigger neuropathological developments. The central nervous system (CNS) is in possession of dedicated homeostatic system that removes, accumulates, stores and releases these metals to fulfil nervous tissue demand. This system is mainly associated with astrocytes that act as dynamic reservoirs for trace metals, these being a part of a global system of CNS ionostasis. Here we overview physiological and pathophysiological aspects of astrocyte-cantered trace metals regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The morphology and spatial distribution of axon arbors and boutons are crucial for neuron presynaptic functions. However, the principles governing their whole-brain organization at the single-neuron level remain unclear. We developed a machine-learning method to separate axon arbors from passing axons in single-neuron reconstruction from fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography imaging data and obtained 62,374 axon arbors that displayed distinct morphology, spatial patterns, and scaling laws dependent on neuron types and targeted brain areas. Focusing on the axon arbors in the thalamus and cortex, we revealed the segregated spatial distributions and distinct morphology but shared topographic gradients between feedforward and feedback projections. Furthermore, we uncovered an association between arbor complexity and microglia density. Finally, we found that the boutons on terminal arbors show branch-specific clustering with a log-normal distribution that again differed between feedforward and feedback terminal arbors. Together, our study revealed distinct presynaptic structural organizations underlying diverse functional innervation of single projection neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Detecting visual features in the environment is crucial for animals’ survival. The superior colliculus (SC) is implicated in motion detection and processing, whereas how the SC integrates visual inputs from the two eyes remains unclear. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we show that mouse SC contains many binocular neurons that display robust ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in a critical period during early development, which is similar to, but not dependent on, the primary visual cortex. NR2A- and NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play an essential role in the regulation of SC plasticity. Blocking NMDA receptors can largely prevent the impairment of predatory hunting caused by monocular deprivation, indicating that maintaining the binocularity of SC neurons is required for efficient hunting behavior. Together, our studies reveal the existence and function of OD plasticity in SC, which broadens our understanding of the development of subcortical visual circuitry relating to motion detection and predatory hunting.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic status is crucial for stem cell functions; however, the metabolic heterogeneity of endogenous stem cells has never been directly assessed. Here, we develop a platform for high-throughput single-cell metabolomics (hi-scMet) of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). By combining flow cytometric isolation and nanoparticle-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, we routinely detected >100 features from single cells. We mapped the single-cell metabolomes of all hematopoietic cell populations and HSC subpopulations with different division times, detecting 33 features whose levels exhibited trending changes during HSC proliferation. We found progressive activation of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OxiPPP) from dormant to active HSCs. Genetic or pharmacological interference with OxiPPP increased reactive oxygen species level in HSCs, reducing HSC self-renewal upon oxidative stress. Together, our work uncovers the metabolic dynamics during HSC proliferation, reveals a role of OxiPPP for HSC activation, and illustrates the utility of hi-scMet in dissecting metabolic heterogeneity of immunophenotypically defined cell populations.

Abstract: Previous literature revealed that genistein might play a preventive role in osteoporosis. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of genistein on the osteogenic potency of laying hens’ adipose-derived stem cells (LHASCs). The viability of LHASCs after isolation was investigated on tissue culture plastic (TCP) under exposure to genistein up to 50 μg/mL by MTT assay. Our preliminary result revealed that LHASCs cultured under genistein exposure up to 20 μg/mL are feasible. Then, we evaluated the osteogenic induction of LHASCs under exposure to 0, 10, and 20 μg/mL genistein. The Alizarin Red staining confirmed the calcium deposition. Our findings showed that osteogenic differentiation under exposure to 20 μg/mL genistein led to higher ALP activity and more calcium content. We then tried to see the probable additive effect of the genistein-plus Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffold on the cell viability and osteogenic capacity of LHASCs. For this, cells were cultured on a PLLA scaffold and exposed to 20 μg/mL genistein. Cell growth rate, as indicated by the MTT assay, revealed no differences between the groups. LHASCs cultured on a genistein-plus PLLA scaffold showed higher ALP activity and more calcium content. The expressions of Osteocalcin, COL1A2, ALP, and Runx2 genes were increased in the genistein-plus PLLA group as compared with PLLA and TCP groups. Adequate proliferation rates and higher expression of osteogenic markers provide genistein as a suitable substrate to support the proliferation and differentiation of LHASCs. Genistein supports osteogenic induction as a further positive effect if such a PLLA scaffold is available.

Abstract: Summary
Vascular morphogenesis requires a delicate gradient of Notch signaling controlled, in part, by the distribution of ligands (Dll4 and Jagged1). How Jagged1 (JAG1) expression is compartmentalized in the vascular plexus remains unclear. Here, we show that Jag1 mRNA is a direct target of zinc-finger protein 36 (ZFP36), an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA decay that we find robustly induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Endothelial cells lacking ZFP36 display high levels of JAG1 and increase angiogenic sprouting in vitro. Furthermore, mice lacking Zfp36 in endothelial cells display mispatterned and increased levels of JAG1 in the developing retinal vascular plexus. Abnormal levels of JAG1 at the sprouting front alters NOTCH1 signaling, increasing the number of tip cells, a phenotype that is rescued by imposing haploinsufficiency of Jag1. Our findings reveal an important feedforward loop whereby VEGF stimulates ZFP36, consequently suppressing Jag1 to enable adequate levels of Notch signaling during sprouting angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The anti-cancer target hRpn13 is a proteasome substrate receptor. However, hRpn13-targeting molecules do not impair its interaction with proteasomes or ubiquitin, suggesting other critical cellular activities. We find that hRpn13 depletion causes correlated proteomic and transcriptomic changes, with pronounced effects in myeloma cells for cytoskeletal and immune response proteins and bone-marrow-specific arginine deiminase PADI4. Moreover, a PROTAC against hRpn13 co-depletes PADI4, histone deacetylase HDAC8, and DNA methyltransferase MGMT. PADI4 binds and citrullinates hRpn13 and proteasomes, and proteasomes from PADI4-inhibited myeloma cells exhibit reduced peptidase activity. When off proteasomes, hRpn13 can bind HDAC8, and this interaction inhibits HDAC8 activity. Further linking hRpn13 to transcription, its loss reduces nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factor p50, which proteasomes generate by cleaving its precursor protein. NF-κB inhibition depletes hRpn13 interactors PADI4 and HDAC8. Altogether, we find that hRpn13 acts dually in protein degradation and expression and that proteasome constituency and, in turn, regulation varies by cell type.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations in the exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase ε cause ultramutated cancers. These cancers accumulate AGA>ATA transversions; however, their genomic features beyond the trinucleotide motifs are obscure. We analyze the extended DNA context of ultramutation using whole-exome sequencing data from 524 endometrial and 395 colorectal tumors. We find that G>T transversions in POLE-mutant tumors predominantly affect sequences containing at least six consecutive purines, with a striking preference for certain positions within polypurine tracts. Using this signature, we develop a machine-learning classifier to identify tumors with hitherto unknown POLE drivers and validate two drivers, POLE-E978G and POLE-S461L, by functional assays in yeast. Unlike other pathogenic variants, the E978G substitution affects the polymerase domain of Pol ε. We further show that tumors with POLD1 drivers share the extended signature of POLE ultramutation. These findings expand the understanding of ultramutation mechanisms and highlight peculiar mutagenic properties of polypurine tracts in the human genome.

Abstract: Summary
In animal cells, the dysregulation of centrosome duplication and cohesion maintenance leads to abnormal spindle assembly and chromosomal instability, contributing to developmental disorders and tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining accurate centrosome number control and tethering are not fully understood. Here, we identified coiled-coil domain-containing 102A (CCDC102A) as a centrosomal protein exhibiting a barrel-like structure in the proximal regions of parent centrioles, where it prevents centrosome overduplication by restricting interactions between Cep192 and Cep152 on centrosomes, thereby ensuring bipolar spindle formation. Additionally, CCDC102A regulates the centrosome linker by recruiting and binding C-Nap1; it is removed from the centrosome after Nek2A-mediated phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis. Overall, our results indicate that CCDC102A participates in controlling centrosome number and maintaining centrosome cohesion, suggesting that a well-tuned system regulates centrosome structure and function throughout the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
PBRM1 is frequently mutated in cancers of epithelial origin. How PBRM1 regulates normal epithelial homeostasis, prior to cancer initiation, remains unclear. Here, we show that PBRM1’s gene regulatory roles differ drastically between cell states, leveraging human skin epithelium (epidermis) as a research platform. In progenitors, PBRM1 predominantly functions to repress terminal differentiation to sustain progenitors’ regenerative potential; in the differentiation state, however, PBRM1 switches toward an activator. Between these two cell states, PBRM1 retains its genomic binding but associates with differential interacting proteins. Our targeted screen identified the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1 as a key interactor. PIAS1 co-localizes with PBRM1 on chromatin to directly repress differentiation genes in progenitors, and PIAS1’s chromatin binding drastically diminishes in differentiation. Furthermore, SUMOylation contributes to PBRM1’s repressive function in progenitor maintenance. Thus, our findings highlight PBRM1’s cell-state-specific regulatory roles influenced by its protein interactome despite its stable chromatin binding.

Abstract: Summary
Apart from the canonical serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT])-receptor signaling transduction pattern, 5-HT-involved post-translational serotonylation has recently been noted. Here, we report a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) serotonylation system that promotes the glycolytic metabolism and antitumor immune activity of CD8+ T cells. Tissue transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) transfers 5-HT to GAPDH glutamine 262 and catalyzes the serotonylation reaction. Serotonylation supports the cytoplasmic localization of GAPDH, which induces a glycolytic metabolic shift in CD8+ T cells and contributes to antitumor immunity. CD8+ T cells accumulate intracellular 5-HT for serotonylation through both synthesis by tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and uptake from the extracellular compartment via serotonin transporter (SERT). Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) degrades 5-HT and acts as an intrinsic negative regulator of CD8+ T cells. The adoptive transfer of 5-HT-producing TPH1-overexpressing chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells induced a robust antitumor response. Our findings expand the known range of neuroimmune interaction patterns by providing evidence of receptor-independent serotonylation post-translational modification.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells differentiate into distinct fates by transitioning through a series of transcriptional states. Current computational approaches allow reconstruction of differentiation trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics data, but it remains unknown to what degree differentiation can be predicted across biological processes. Here, we use transfer learning to infer differentiation processes and quantify predictability in early embryonic development and adult hematopoiesis. Overall, we find that non-linear methods outperform linear approaches, and we achieved the best predictions with a custom variational autoencoder that explicitly models changes in transcriptional variance. We observed a high accuracy of predictions in embryonic development, but we found somewhat lower agreement with the real data in adult hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that this discrepancy can be explained by a higher degree of concordant transcriptional processes along embryonic differentiation compared with adult homeostasis. In summary, we establish a framework for quantifying and exploiting predictability of cellular differentiation trajectories.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark of high-risk childhood medulloblastoma is the dysregulation of RNA translation. Currently, it is unknown whether medulloblastoma dysregulates the translation of putatively oncogenic non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs). To address this question, we performed ribosome profiling of 32 medulloblastoma tissues and cell lines and observed widespread non-canonical ORF translation. We then developed a stepwise approach using multiple CRISPR-Cas9 screens to elucidate non-canonical ORFs and putative microproteins implicated in medulloblastoma cell survival. We determined that multiple lncRNA-ORFs and upstream ORFs (uORFs) exhibited selective functionality independent of main coding sequences. A microprotein encoded by one of these ORFs, ASNSD1-uORF or ASDURF, was upregulated, associated with MYC-family oncogenes, and promoted medulloblastoma cell survival through engagement with the prefoldin-like chaperone complex. Our findings underscore the fundamental importance of non-canonical ORF translation in medulloblastoma and provide a rationale to include these ORFs in future studies seeking to define new cancer targets.

Abstract: Summary
Combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy can provide improved survival in advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients without targetable gene alterations. 537 previously untreated patients with stage IIIB/IIIC or IV squamous NSCLC without targetable gene alterations were enrolled and randomized (2:1) to receive serplulimab 4.5 mg/kg or placebo, both in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, intravenously in 3-week cycles. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) was met at the first interim analysis. At the second interim analysis, PFS benefit was maintained in serplulimab-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–0.67). At the final analysis, serplulimab-chemotherapy significantly improved median OS compared to placebo-chemotherapy (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58–0.93; p = 0.010). Grade ≥3 serplulimab or placebo-related adverse events occurred in 126 (35.2%) and 58 (32.4%) patients, respectively. Our results demonstrate that adding serplulimab to chemotherapy significantly improves survival in advanced squamous NSCLC patients, with manageable safety.

Abstract: Summary
The roles of platelets/megakaryocytes (MKs), the key components in the blood system, in the tumor microenvironment and antitumor immunity are unclear. In patients with colorectal cancer, the number of platelets was significantly increased in patients with metastasis, and Erbin expression was highly expressed in platelets from patients with metastases. Moreover, Erbin knockout in platelets/MKs suppressed lung metastasis in mice and promoted aggregations of platelets. Mechanistically, Erbin-deficient platelets have increasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and secrete lipid metabolites like acyl-carnitine (Acar) by abolishing interaction with prothrombotic protein ESAM. Notably, Acar enhanced the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in B cells by acetylation of H3K27 epigenetically. Targeting Erbin in platelets/MKs by a nanovesicle system dramatically attenuated lung metastasis in mice in vivo. Our study identifies an Erbin-mitochondria axis in platelets/MKs, which suppresses B cell-mediated antitumor immunity, suggesting a new way for the treatment of metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic screens in cancer cell lines inform gene function and drug discovery. More comprehensive screen datasets with multi-omics data are needed to enhance opportunities to functionally map genetic vulnerabilities. Here, we construct a second-generation map of cancer dependencies by annotating 930 cancer cell lines with multi-omic data and analyze relationships between molecular markers and cancer dependencies derived from CRISPR-Cas9 screens. We identify dependency-associated gene expression markers beyond driver genes, and observe many gene addiction relationships driven by gain of function rather than synthetic lethal effects. By combining clinically informed dependency-marker associations with protein-protein interaction networks, we identify 370 anti-cancer priority targets for 27 cancer types, many of which have network-based evidence of a functional link with a marker in a cancer type. Mapping these targets to sequenced tumor cohorts identifies tractable targets in different cancer types. This target prioritization map enhances understanding of gene dependencies and identifies candidate anti-cancer targets for drug development.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in pulmonary hypertension (PH), whereas the mechanisms and treatments remain to be explored. TRPV2 regulates the structure and function of the cardiovascular system; however, little attention has been given to its role in AF. This study was to determine whether TRPV2 was involved in PH-induced AF and the effects of TRPV2 inhibitor tranilast on AF in rat models of PH. Monocrotaline (MCT) and SU5416/hypoxia (SuHx)-induced PH models were performed to detect atrial electrophysiological parameters. Daily tranilast (a TRPV2 inhibitor) or saline was given starting 1 day before PH establishment. PH increased the susceptibility to AF, with TRPV2 up-regulated in the right atria. Compared to PH rats, tranilast reduced AF inducibility and the prolongations of ERP and APD; mitigated cardiopulmonary remodeling and the increases in P-wave duration and P-R interval; partially reversed the down-regulation of ion channels such as Cav1.2, Nav1.5, Kv4.3, Kv4.2, Kv1.5, Kir2.1, Kir3.1, Kir3.4 as well as connexin (Cx) 40 and Cx43; improved right atrial (RA) fibrosis, enlargement, and myocardial hypertrophy; decreased the accumulation of inflammatory cells; down-regulated inflammatory indicators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL1, and CXCL2; and inhibited the activation of the PI3K-AKT-NF-κB signaling pathway. Our results reveal that TRPV2 participates in PH-induced AF, and TRPV2 inhibitor tranilast prevents PH-induced RA remodeling. TRPV2 might be a promising target for PH-induced AF.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming is key for cancer development, yet the mechanism that sustains triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell growth despite deficient pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and tumor glycolysis remains to be determined. Here, we find that deficiency in tumor glycolysis activates a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) to fuel TNBC growth. We show that, in TNBC cells, PKM2 directly interacts with histone methyltransferase EZH2 to coordinately mediate epigenetic silencing of a carnitine transporter, SLC16A9. Inhibition of PKM2 leads to impaired EZH2 recruitment to SLC16A9, and in turn de-represses SLC16A9 expression to increase intracellular carnitine influx, programming TNBC cells to an FAO-dependent and luminal-like cell state. Together, these findings reveal a new metabolic switch that drives TNBC from a metabolically heterogeneous-lineage plastic cell state to an FAO-dependent-lineage committed cell state, where dual targeting of EZH2 and FAO induces potent synthetic lethality in TNBC.

MRPL21 promotes HCC proliferation through TP53 mutation-induced apoptotic resistance,

Abstract: Background and aims
The specific mechanisms underlying the inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and metastasis by mitochondrial apoptosis are not yet fully understood. However, it plays a vital role in suppressing HCC's ability to proliferate and spread. The involvement of MRPL21, a member within the family of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs), is well-documented in both cellular apoptosis and energy metabolism. This study aims to explore and unravel the underlying mechanisms through which MRPL21 contributes to mitochondrial apoptosis and resistance against apoptosis in HCC.
Methods
To evaluate the level of MRPL21 expression at the gene and protein expression levels, analysis was performed on human liver samples and blood using techniques for quantification. A knockdown plasmid targeting MRPL21 was constructed to investigate its impact on the growth and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To evaluate the impact of MRPL21 knockdown on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation and apoptosis, various assays were performed including CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry analysis, detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Furthermore, the role of MRPL21 in TP53 mutation was examined using Nutlin-3.
Results
In HCC tissues and blood samples, an upregulation of MRPL21 expression was observed when compared to samples obtained from healthy individuals, and it is correlated with a poor prognosis for HCC. Silencing MRPL21 can effectively suppress Hep3B and HCCLM3 cells proliferation by modulating the mitochondrial membrane potential, it triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby leading to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and initiation of early apoptosis. Furthermore, by inhibiting P53 activity, Nutlin-3 treatment can enhance MRPL21-deficiency-mediated apoptosis in Hep3B and HCCLM3 cells.
Conclusion
Through its influence on TP53 mutation, MRPL21 promotes HCC proliferation and progression while conferring resistance to apoptosis. These findings suggest that MRPL21 holds promise as a valuable biomarker for the treatment of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Inactivating mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes impair DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR), leading to chromosomal instability and cancer. Importantly, BRCA1/2 deficiency also causes therapeutically targetable vulnerabilities. Here, we identify the dependency on the end resection factor EXO1 as a key vulnerability of BRCA1-deficient cells. EXO1 deficiency generates poly(ADP-ribose)-decorated DNA lesions during S phase that associate with unresolved DSBs and genomic instability in BRCA1-deficient but not in wild-type or BRCA2-deficient cells. Our data indicate that BRCA1/EXO1 double-deficient cells accumulate DSBs due to impaired repair by single-strand annealing (SSA) on top of their HR defect. In contrast, BRCA2-deficient cells retain SSA activity in the absence of EXO1 and hence tolerate EXO1 loss. Consistent with a dependency on EXO1-mediated SSA, we find that BRCA1-mutated tumors show elevated EXO1 expression and increased SSA-associated genomic scars compared with BRCA1-proficient tumors. Overall, our findings uncover EXO1 as a promising therapeutic target for BRCA1-deficient tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The recent proliferation of new Cre and CreER recombinase lines provides researchers with a diverse toolkit to study microglial gene function. To determine how best to apply these lines in studies of microglial gene function, a thorough and detailed comparison of their properties is needed. Here, we examined four different microglial CreER lines (Cx3cr1YFP-CreER(Litt), Cx3cr1CreER(Jung), P2ry12CreER, and Tmem119CreER), focusing on (1) recombination specificity, (2) leakiness (the degree of tamoxifen-independent recombination in microglia and other cells), (3) the efficiency of tamoxifen-induced recombination, (4) extraneural recombination (the degree of recombination in cells outside of the CNS, particularly myelo/monocyte lineages), and (5) off-target effects in the context of neonatal brain development. We identify important caveats and strengths for these lines, which will provide broad significance for researchers interested in performing conditional gene deletion in microglia. We also provide data emphasizing the potential of these lines for injury models that result in the recruitment of splenic immune cells.

Abstract: Summary
While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) shows promise in treating human diseases, oral capsule FMT is more accepted and accessible to patients. However, microbe selection in the upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) through oral administration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that short-term oral fecal gavage (OFG) alleviates acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury (AILI) in mice, regardless of the divergent effects of commensal gut microbes. Pasteurized fecal gavage yields similar therapeutic effects. OFG enriches gut Lachnospiraceae and butyrate compared to donor feces. Butyrate mitigates AILI-induced ferroptosis via AMPK-ULK1-p62 signaling to simultaneously induce mitophagy and Nrf2 antioxidant responses. Combined N-acetylcysteine and butyrate administration significantly improves AILI mouse survival rates. These observations indicate the significance of the UGIT in modulating the implanted fecal microbes through oral administration and its potential biological and clinical impacts. Our findings also highlight a possible strategy for applying microbial metabolites to treat acute liver injury.

Abstract: Summary
The integrated stress response (ISR) is critical for cell survival under stress. In response to diverse environmental cues, eIF2α becomes phosphorylated, engendering a dramatic change in mRNA translation. The activation of ISR plays a pivotal role in the early embryogenesis, but the eIF2-dependent translational landscape in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is largely unexplored. We employ a multi-omics approach consisting of ribosome profiling, proteomics, and metabolomics in wild-type (eIF2α+/+) and phosphorylation-deficient mutant eIF2α (eIF2αA/A) mouse ESCs (mESCs) to investigate phosphorylated (p)-eIF2α-dependent translational control of naive pluripotency. We show a transient increase in p-eIF2α in the naive epiblast layer of E4.5 embryos. Absence of eIF2α phosphorylation engenders an exit from naive pluripotency following 2i (two chemical inhibitors of MEK1/2 and GSK3α/β) withdrawal. p-eIF2α controls translation of mRNAs encoding proteins that govern pluripotency, chromatin organization, and glutathione synthesis. Thus, p-eIF2α acts as a key regulator of the naive pluripotency gene regulatory network.

Abstract: Summary
To examine how bacteria achieve robust cell proliferation across diverse conditions, we developed a method that quantifies 77 cell morphological, cell cycle, and growth phenotypes of a fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli strain and >800 gene deletion derivatives under multiple nutrient conditions. This approach revealed extensive phenotypic plasticity and deviating mutant phenotypes were often nutrient dependent. From this broad phenotypic landscape emerged simple and robust unifying rules (laws) that connect DNA replication initiation, nucleoid segregation, FtsZ ring formation, and cell constriction to specific aspects of cell size (volume, length, or added length) at the population level. Furthermore, completion of cell division followed the initiation of cell constriction after a constant time delay across strains and nutrient conditions, identifying cell constriction as a key control point for cell size determination. Our work provides a population-level description of the governing principles by which E. coli integrates cell cycle processes and growth rate with cell size to achieve its robust proliferative capability. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive, profoundly heterogeneous cancer, presenting a challenge for precision medicine. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors block B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and are particularly effective in certain molecular subtypes of DLBCL that rely on chronic active BCR signaling to promote oncogenic NF-κB. The MCD genetic subtype, which often acquires mutations in the BCR subunit, CD79B, and in the innate immune adapter, MYD88L265P, typically resists chemotherapy but responds exceptionally to BTK inhibitors. However, the underlying mechanisms of response to BTK inhibitors are poorly understood. Herein, we find a non-canonical form of chronic selective autophagy in MCD DLBCL that targets ubiquitinated MYD88L265P for degradation in a TBK1-dependent manner. MCD tumors acquire genetic and epigenetic alterations that attenuate this autophagic tumor suppressive pathway. In contrast, BTK inhibitors promote autophagic degradation of MYD88L265P, thus explaining their exceptional clinical benefit in MCD DLBCL.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising therapy for solid tumors, but its effectiveness depends on biomarkers that are not precise. Here, we utilized genome-wide association study to investigate the association between genetic variants and tumor mutation burden to interpret ICB response. We identified 16 variants (p < 5 × 10−8) probed to 17 genes on 9 chromosomes. Subsequent analysis of one of the most significant loci in 19q13.11 suggested that the rs111308825 locus at the enhancer is causal, as its A allele impairs KLF2 binding, leading to lower carbohydrate sulfotransferase 8 (CHST8) expression. Breast cancer cells expressing CHST8 suppress T cell activation, and Chst8 loss attenuates tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse model. Further investigation revealed that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its homologs could be sulfated by CHST8, resulting in M2-like macrophage enrichment in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we confirmed that low-CHST8 tumors have better ICB response, supporting the genetic effect and clinical value of rs111308825 for ICB efficacy prediction.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA vaccines have proven to be pivotal in the fight against COVID-19. A recommended booster, given 3 to 4 weeks post the initial vaccination, can substantially amplify protective antibody levels. Here, we show that, compared to contralateral boost, ipsilateral boost of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine induces more germinal center B cells (GCBCs) specific to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and generates more bone marrow plasma cells. Ipsilateral boost can more rapidly generate high-affinity RBD-specific antibodies with improved cross-reactivity to the Omicron variant. Mechanistically, the ipsilateral boost promotes the positive selection and plasma cell differentiation of pre-existing GCBCs from the prior vaccination, associated with the expansion of T follicular helper cells. Furthermore, we show that ipsilateral immunization with an unrelated antigen after a prior mRNA vaccination enhances the germinal center and antibody responses to the new antigen compared to contralateral immunization. These findings propose feasible approaches to optimize vaccine effectiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Although DNA N6-methyl-deoxyadenosine (6mA) is abundant in bacteria and protists, its presence and function in mammalian genomes have been less clear. We present Direct-Read 6mA sequencing (DR-6mA-seq), an antibody-independent method, to measure 6mA at base resolution. DR-6mA-seq employs a unique mutation-based strategy to reveal 6mA sites as misincorporation signatures without any chemical or enzymatic modulation of 6mA. We validated DR-6mA-seq through the successful mapping of the well-characterized G(6mA)TC motif in the E. coli DNA. As expected, when applying DR-6mA-seq to mammalian systems, we found that genomic DNA (gDNA) 6mA abundance is generally low in most mammalian tissues and cells; however, we did observe distinct gDNA 6mA sites in mouse testis and glioblastoma cells. DR-6mA-seq provides an enabling tool to detect 6mA at single-base resolution for a comprehensive understanding of DNA 6mA in eukaryotes.

Abstract: The current study investigated the potential effects of probiotic supplementation on colorectal carcinogenesis chemically induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and treated with 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy in mice. Animals were randomly allocated in five different groups: Control: which not receive any treatment throughout the experimental course; Colitis model group (DMH): treated with DMH; DMH+ 5FU: animals received I.P. (intraperitoneal) dose of chemotherapy on a weekly basis; DMH+PROB: animals received daily administrations (via gavage) of probiotics (Lactobacillus: acidophilus and paracasei, Bifidobacterium lactis and bifidum); and DMH+ PROB+ 5FU: animals received the same treatment as the previous groups. After ten-week treatment, mice’s large intestine was collected and subjected to colon length, histopathological, periodic acid-schiff (PAS) staining and immunohistochemistry (TLR2, MyD88, NF-κB, IL-6, TLR4, TRIF, IRF-3, IFN-γ, Ki-67, KRAS, p53, IL-10, and TGF-β) analyzes. Variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis, at significance level p 0.05. Probiotics’ supplementation has increased the production of Ki-67 cell-proliferation marker, reduced body weight, and colon shortening, as well as modulated the chronic inflammatory process in colorectal carcinogenesis by inhibiting NF-κB expression and mitigating mucin depletion. Thus, these findings lay a basis for guide future studies focused on probiotics’ action mechanisms in tumor microenvironment which might have implications in clinical practice.

Abstract: Summary
Omicron, as the emerging variant with enhanced vaccine tolerance, has sharply disrupted most therapeutic antibodies. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, members of which share high sequence similarity. Herein, we report one sarbecovirus antibody, 5817, which has broad-spectrum neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and SARS-CoV, as well as related bat and pangolin viruses. 5817 can hardly compete with six classes of receptor-binding-domain-targeted antibodies grouped by structural classifications. No obvious impairment in the potency is detected against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and subvariants. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of neutralizing antibody 5817 in complex with Omicron spike reveals a highly conserved epitope, only existing at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) open state. Prophylactic and therapeutic administration of 5817 potently protects mice from SARS-CoV-2 Beta, Delta, Omicron, and SARS-CoV infection. This study reveals a highly conserved cryptic epitope targeted by a broad sarbecovirus neutralizing antibody, which would be beneficial to meet the potential threat of pre-emergent SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

Abstract: Summary
The interplay between metabolism and chromatin signaling is implicated in cancer progression. However, whether and how metabolic reprogramming in tumors generates chromatin vulnerabilities remain unclear. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors frequently harbor aberrant activation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway, which drives aggressive and chemo-resistant disease. Using a chromatin-focused CRISPR screen, we report that NRF2 activation sensitizes LUAD cells to genetic and chemical inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). This association is observed across cultured cells, mouse models, and patient-derived xenografts. Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analysis demonstrates that HDAC inhibition causes widespread redistribution of H4ac and its reader protein, which transcriptionally downregulates metabolic enzymes. This results in reduced flux into amino acid metabolism and de novo nucleotide synthesis pathways that are preferentially required for the survival of NRF2-active cancer cells. Together, our findings suggest NRF2 activation as a potential biomarker for effective repurposing of HDAC inhibitors to treat solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) determines the temporal ordering of the cell cycle phases. However, despite significant progress in studying regulators of CDK and phosphorylation patterns of CDK substrates at the population level, it remains elusive how CDK regulators coordinately affect CDK activity at the single-cell level and how CDK controls the temporal order of cell cycle events. Here, we elucidate the dynamics of CDK activity in fission yeast and mammalian cells by developing a CDK activity biosensor, Eevee-spCDK. We find that although CDK activity does not necessarily correlate with cyclin levels, it converges to the same level around mitotic onset in several mutant backgrounds, including pom1Δ cells and wee1 or cdc25 overexpressing cells. These data provide direct evidence that cells enter the M phase when CDK activity reaches a high threshold, consistent with the quantitative model of cell cycle progression in fission yeast.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of risk loci for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, non-European populations are underrepresented in GWASs, and the causal gene-regulatory mechanisms of these risk loci during atherosclerosis remain unclear. We incorporated local ancestry and haplotypes to identify quantitative trait loci for expression (eQTLs) and splicing (sQTLs) in coronary arteries from 138 ancestrally diverse Americans. Of 2,132 eQTL-associated genes (eGenes), 47% were previously unreported in coronary artery; 19% exhibited cell-type-specific expression. Colocalization revealed subgroups of eGenes unique to CAD and blood pressure GWAS. Fine-mapping highlighted additional eGenes, including TBX20 and IL5. We also identified sQTLs for 1,690 genes, among which TOR1AIP1 and ULK3 sQTLs demonstrated the importance of evaluating splicing to accurately identify disease-relevant isoform expression. Our work provides a patient-derived coronary artery eQTL resource and exemplifies the need for diverse study populations and multifaceted approaches to characterize gene regulation in disease processes.

Abstract: Summary
This study examines the impact of sample size on predicting cognitive and mental health phenotypes from brain imaging via machine learning. Our analysis shows a 3- to 9-fold improvement in prediction performance when sample size increases from 1,000 to 1 M participants. However, despite this increase, the data suggest that prediction accuracy remains worryingly low and far from fully exploiting the predictive potential of brain imaging data. Additionally, we find that integrating multiple imaging modalities boosts prediction accuracy, often equivalent to doubling the sample size. Interestingly, the most informative imaging modality often varied with increasing sample size, emphasizing the need to consider multiple modalities. Despite significant performance reserves for phenotype prediction, achieving substantial improvements may necessitate prohibitively large sample sizes, thus casting doubt on the practical or clinical utility of machine learning in some areas of neuroimaging.

Abstract: Background
To investigate the mechanism of action of stathmin1 (STMN1) in mesothelioma (MSM) and whether it has any role in its treatment.
Methods
STMN1 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in biopsy tissues taken from MSM patients. The relationships between the levels of STMN1 expression in the pathology preparations of MSM patients, and the clinicopathological characteristics of these patients, and their survival times were investigated. Transfection of STMN1-specific siRNA into SPC212 cells was compared to negative control siRNAs. The mRNA levels of genes that may play a role in invasion, apoptosis, and autophagy were evaluated by RT-PCR.
Results
The expression of STMN1 was shown to be high in MSM tissues (p < 0.05). It was found that the only independent predictor factor affecting the survival time of MSM patients was the disease stage (p < 0.05). STMN1 was significantly reduced after siRNA intervention (81.5%). STMN1 with specific siRNA has been shown to suppress invasion by reducing the mRNA levels of cadherin-6 (CDH6), fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1A), matrix metallopeptidase 1–2 (gelatinase A) (MMP1–2), and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 (TIMP2), which are important markers for invasion. Although the expression of apoptosis and autophagy-related genes, caspase-2 (Casp2) and LC-3, was reduced by silencing STMN1 with specific siRNA in western blot analysis, this effect was not observed in PCR results.
Conclusions

Abstract: Summary
Reward-predictive cues acquire motivating and reinforcing properties that contribute to the escalation and relapse of drug use in addiction. The ventral pallidum (VP) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are two key nodes in brain reward circuitry implicated in addiction and cue-driven behavior. In the current study, we use in vivo fiber photometry and optogenetics to record from and manipulate VP→VTA in rats performing a discriminative stimulus task to determine the role these neurons play in invigoration and reinforcement by reward cues. We find that VP→VTA neurons are active during reward consumption and that optogenetic stimulation of these neurons biases choice behavior and is reinforcing. Critically, we find no encoding of reward-seeking vigor, and optogenetic stimulation does not enhance the probability or vigor of reward seeking in response to cues. Our results suggest that VP→VTA activity is more important for reinforcement than for invigoration of reward seeking by cues.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations or dysregulation of nucleoporins (Nups) are strongly associated with neural developmental diseases, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that depletion of Nup Seh1 in radial glial progenitors results in defective neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation that ultimately manifests in impaired neurogenesis and microcephaly. This loss of stem cell proliferation is not associated with defects in the nucleocytoplasmic transport. Rather, transcriptome analysis showed that ablation of Seh1 in neural stem cells derepresses the expression of p21, and knockdown of p21 partially restored self-renewal capacity. Mechanistically, Seh1 cooperates with the NuRD transcription repressor complex at the nuclear periphery to regulate p21 expression. Together, these findings identified that Nups regulate brain development by exerting a chromatin-associated role and affecting neural stem cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Itaconate is a metabolite that synthesized from cis-aconitate in mitochondria and transported into the cytosol to exert multiple regulatory effects in macrophages. However, the mechanism by which itaconate exits from macrophages remains unknown. Using a genetic screen, we reveal that itaconate is exported from cytosol to extracellular space by ATP-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) in an ATPase-dependent manner in human and mouse macrophages. Elevation of transcription factor TFEB-dependent lysosomal biogenesis and antibacterial innate immunity are observed in inflammatory macrophages with deficiency of ABCG2-mediated itaconate export. Furthermore, deficiency of ABCG2-mediated itaconate export in macrophages promotes antibacterial innate immune defense in a mouse model of S. typhimurium infection. Thus, our findings identify ABCG2-mediated itaconate export as a key regulatory mechanism that limits TFEB-dependent lysosomal biogenesis and antibacterial innate immunity in inflammatory macrophages, implying the potential therapeutic utility of blocking itaconate export in treating human bacterial infections.

Abstract: Summary
The tactics used by animal pathogens to combat host immunity are largely unclear. Here, we report the depiction of the virulence-required effector Tge1 deployed by the entomopathogen Metarhizium robertsii to suppress Drosophila antifungal immunity. Tge1 can target both GNBP3 and GNBP-like 3 (GL3), and the latter can bind to β-glucans like GNBP3, whereas the glucan binding by both receptors can be attenuated by Tge1. As opposed to the surveillance GNBP3, GL3 is inducible in Drosophila depending on the Toll pathway via a positive feedback loop mechanism. Losses of GNBP3 and GL3 genes result in the deregulations of protease cascade, Spätzle maturation, and antimicrobial gene expressions in Drosophila upon fungal challenges. Fly survival assays confirm that GL3 plays a more essential role than GNBP3 in combating fungal infections. In addition to evidencing the gene-for-gene interactions between fungi and insects, our data advance insights into Drosophila antifungal immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Opioids are generally known to promote hedonic food consumption. Although much of the existing evidence is primarily based on studies of the mesolimbic pathway, endogenous opioids and their receptors are widely expressed in hypothalamic appetite circuits as well; however, their role in homeostatic feeding remains unclear. Using a fluorescent opioid sensor, deltaLight, here we report that mediobasal hypothalamic opioid levels increase by feeding, which directly and indirectly inhibits agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons through the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). AgRP-specific MOR expression increases by energy surfeit and contributes to opioid-induced suppression of appetite. Conversely, its antagonists diminish suppression of AgRP neuron activity by food and satiety hormones. Mice with AgRP neuron-specific ablation of MOR expression have increased fat preference without increased motivation. These results suggest that post-ingestion release of endogenous opioids contributes to AgRP neuron inhibition to shape food choice through MOR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Functions of the SKP1-CUL1-F box (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligases are essential in plants. The F box proteins (FBPs) are substrate receptors that recruit substrates and assemble an active SCF complex, but the regulatory mechanism underlying the FBPs binding to CUL1 to activate the SCF cycle is not fully understood. We show that Arabidopsis csn1-10 is defective in SCFEBF1-mediated PIF3 degradation during de-etiolation, due to impaired association of EBF1 with CUL1 in csn1-10. EBF1 preferentially associates with un-neddylated CUL1 that is deficient in csn1-10 and the EBF1-CUL1 binding is rescued by the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924. Furthermore, we identify a subset of FBPs with impaired binding to CUL1 in csn1-10, indicating their assembly to form SCF complexes may depend on COP9 signalosome (CSN)-mediated deneddylation of CUL1. This study reports that a key role of CSN-mediated CULLIN deneddylation is to gate the binding of the FBP-substrate module to CUL1, thus initiating the SCF cycle of substrate ubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
Recognizing familiar faces and learning new faces play an important role in social cognition. However, the underlying neural computational mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we record from single neurons in the human amygdala and hippocampus and find a greater neuronal representational distance between pairs of familiar faces than unfamiliar faces, suggesting that neural representations for familiar faces are more distinct. Representational distance increases with exposures to the same identity, suggesting that neural face representations are sharpened with learning and familiarization. Furthermore, representational distance is positively correlated with visual dissimilarity between faces, and exposure to visually similar faces increases representational distance, thus sharpening neural representations. Finally, we construct a computational model that demonstrates an increase in the representational distance of artificial units with training. Together, our results suggest that the neuronal population geometry, quantified by the representational distance, encodes face familiarity, similarity, and learning, forming the basis of face recognition and memory.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexan parasites possess specialized secretory organelles called rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules that play a vital role in host infection. In this study, we demonstrate that TgREMIND, a protein found in Toxoplasma gondii, is necessary for the biogenesis of rhoptries and dense granules. TgREMIND contains a Fes-CIP4 homology-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (F-BAR) domain, which binds to membrane phospholipids, as well as a novel uncharacterized domain that we have named REMIND (regulator of membrane-interacting domain). Both the F-BAR domain and the REMIND are crucial for TgREMIND functions. When TgREMIND is depleted, there is a significant decrease in the abundance of dense granules and abnormal transparency of rhoptries, leading to a reduction in protein secretion from these organelles. The absence of TgREMIND inhibits host invasion and parasite dissemination, demonstrating that TgREMIND is essential for the proper function of critical secretory organelles required for successful infection by Toxoplasma.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise training can stimulate the formation of fatty-acid-oxidizing slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, which are inversely correlated with obesity, but the molecular mechanism underlying this transformation requires further elucidation. Here, we report that the downregulation of the mitochondrial disulfide relay carrier CHCHD4 by exercise training decreases the import of TP53-regulated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (TRIAP1) into mitochondria, which can reduce cardiolipin levels and promote VDAC oligomerization in skeletal muscle. VDAC oligomerization, known to facilitate mtDNA release, can activate cGAS-STING/NFKB innate immune signaling and downregulate MyoD in skeletal muscle, thereby promoting the formation of oxidative slow-twitch fibers. In mice, CHCHD4 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to activate this pathway, leading to increased oxidative muscle fibers and decreased fat accumulation with aging. The identification of a specific mediator regulating muscle fiber transformation provides an opportunity to understand further the molecular underpinnings of complex metabolic conditions such as obesity and could have therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are the predominant lymphocyte population in the liver. At the onset of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an accumulation of activated NK cells is observed in the liver in parallel with inflammatory monocyte recruitment and an increased systemic inflammation. Using in vivo and in vitro experiments, we unveil a specific stimulation of NK cell-poiesis during NASH by medullary monocytes that trans-present interleukin-15 (IL-15) and secrete osteopontin, a biomarker for patients with NASH. This cellular dialogue leads to increased survival and maturation of NK precursors that are recruited to the liver, where they dampen the inflammatory monocyte infiltration. The increase in the production of both osteopontin and the IL-15/IL-15Rα complex by bone marrow monocytes is induced by endotoxemia. We propose a tripartite gut-liver-bone marrow axis regulating the immune population dynamics and effector functions during liver inflammation.

Abstract: The marginal transitional zone (MTZ) is peripherally located within the diarthrodial joint, and represents the junction of synovium, fibrous joint capsule, articular cartilage, periosteum, and bone. The purpose of this study is to characterize age-related differences in protein expression of matrix and molecular regulators in the marginal transitional zone of neonatal and weanling foals. Several families of proteins with known roles in cartilage and bone development are investigated, including matrix molecules, members of the Wnt signaling family, apoptotic factors and paracrine cell signaling molecules. Our results demonstrate differential protein expression in the marginal transitional zone from the lateral femoral trochlear ridge of neonatal and weanling foals. Protein expression of several paracrine signaling molecules (Ihh, PTHrP, PDGF, VEGF, β-catenin, cytochrome C) within MTZ cartilage is higher in weanling-aged foals. Collagen type II and lubricin expression is similarly greater in weanling-aged foals, while matrix metalloproteinases are lower, likely reflecting the remodeling that occurs during cartilage development as increasing forces are placed on cartilage.

Abstract: This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the histological structure of intestinal tissues of platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus) and swordtail fish (Xiphophorus helleri). Specifically, the objectives were: (1) to compare the structural adaptations of their intestines related to their distinct feeding habits, diet, and digestive strategies; and (2) to explore their potential as animal models for intestinal disease research. Through detailed examination of tissue morphology, cell types, and structural features, this study found that both species lack a stomach, with the intestine directly connected to the esophagus. Additionally, this study proposes a new division of the intestine into anterior and posterior segments based on distinct histological characteristics. The anterior segment may be adapted for temporary food storage and digestion and was characterized by elongated epithelial cells and thin intestinal folds. In contrast, the posterior segment displayed shorter villi and higher concentrations of goblet cells. This study is the first to describe in detail the intestinal morphology of platyfish and swordtail fish. These findings contribute significantly to the understanding of the comparative anatomy and physiology of these fish species, highlighting their potential as valuable models for intestinal biology research.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular proteostasis requires transport of polypeptides across membranes. Although defective transport processes trigger cytosolic rescue and quality control mechanisms that clear translocases and membranes from unproductive cargo, proteins that are synthesized within mitochondria are not accessible to these mechanisms. Mitochondrial-encoded proteins are inserted cotranslationally into the inner membrane by the conserved insertase OXA1L. Here, we identify TMEM126A as a OXA1L-interacting protein. TMEM126A associates with mitochondrial ribosomes and translation products. Loss of TMEM126A leads to the destabilization of mitochondrial translation products, triggering an inner membrane quality control process, in which newly synthesized proteins are degraded by the mitochondrial iAAA protease. Our data reveal that TMEM126A cooperates with OXA1L in protein insertion into the membrane. Upon loss of TMEM126A, the cargo-blocked OXA1L insertase complexes undergo proteolytic clearance by the iAAA protease machinery together with its cargo.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal neural circuits that execute movement are composed of cardinal classes of neurons that emerged from distinct progenitor lineages. Each cardinal class contains multiple neuronal subtypes characterized by distinct molecular, anatomical, and physiological characteristics. Through a focus on the excitatory V3 interneuron class, here we demonstrate that interneuron subtype diversity is delineated through a combination of neurogenesis timing and final laminar settling position. We have revealed that early-born and late-born embryonic V3 temporal classes further diversify into subclasses with spatially and molecularly discrete identities. While neurogenesis timing accounts for V3 morphological diversification, laminar settling position accounts for electrophysiological profiles distinguishing V3 subtypes within the same temporal classes. Furthermore, V3 interneuron subtypes display independent behavioral recruitment patterns demonstrating a functional modularity underlying V3 interneuron diversity. These studies provide a framework for how early embryonic temporal and spatial mechanisms combine to delineate spinal interneuron classes into molecularly, anatomically, and functionally relevant subtypes in adults.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects one-third of the global population. Understanding the metabolic pathways involved can provide insights into disease progression and treatment. Untargeted metabolomics of livers from mice with early-stage steatosis uncovered decreased methylated metabolites, suggesting altered one-carbon metabolism. The levels of glycine, a central component of one-carbon metabolism, were lower in mice with hepatic steatosis, consistent with clinical evidence. Stable-isotope tracing demonstrated that increased serine synthesis from glycine via reverse serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is the underlying cause for decreased glycine in steatotic livers. Consequently, limited glycine availability in steatotic livers impaired glutathione synthesis under acetaminophen-induced oxidative stress, enhancing acute hepatotoxicity. Glycine supplementation or hepatocyte-specific ablation of the mitochondrial SHMT2 isoform in mice with hepatic steatosis mitigated acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity by supporting de novo glutathione synthesis. Thus, early metabolic changes in MASLD that limit glycine availability sensitize mice to xenobiotics even at the reversible stage of this disease.

Abstract: For the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), the classical view is that chondrocyte apoptosis is associated with and may cause age-related joint degeneration. Recent observations indicate that Piezo1, a mechanical stress channel expressed in articular cartilage, plays a crucial role in this process. We wanted to investigate whether other conditions activate the expression of Piezo1 in chondrocytes. Therefore, we simulated OA to investigate whether Piezo1 gene expression and channel function were affected by the inflammatory factor,interleukin-1β, and the role of Piezo1 in the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis of chondrocytes. After the primary culture of human chondrocytes, the primary chondrocytes were treated with different concentrations of IL-1β. It was found that IL-1β upregulated the expression of Piezo1 in human chondrocytes. After Piezo1 activation, we analyzed the expression of autophagy and apoptosis of chondrocytes and investigated whether the downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway mediated the autophagy and apoptosis of chondrocytes. IL-1β activates Piezo1 to inhibit chondrocyte autophagy and promote chondrocyte apoptosis partially, represented by up-regulation of related proteins c-caspase 3, Bax expression, and down-regulation of Bcl2, LC3, p62 expression. Piezo1-siRNA inverted this step partially. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway reduces Piezo1 inhibition of chondrocyte autophagy and activation of chondrocyte apoptosis. Therefore, IL-1β-mediated Piezo1 inhibition of chondrocyte autophagy and promotion of chondrocyte apoptosis partially through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is considered a novel pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic chromosome remodeling and nuclear compartmentalization take place during mammalian meiotic prophase I. We report here that the crucial roles of male pachynema-specific protein (MAPS) in pachynema progression might be mediated by its liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and in cellulo. MAPS forms distinguishable liquid phases, and deletion or mutations of its N-terminal amino acids (aa) 2−9 disrupt its secondary structure and charge properties, impeding phase separation. Maps−/− pachytene spermatocytes exhibit defects in nucleus compartmentalization, including defects in forming sex bodies, altered nucleosome composition, and disordered chromatin accessibility. MapsΔ2–9/Δ2–9 male mice expressing MAPS protein lacking aa 2–9 phenocopy Maps−/− mice. Moreover, a frameshift mutation in C3orf62, the human counterpart of Maps, is correlated with nonobstructive azoospermia in a patient exhibiting pachynema arrest in spermatocyte development. Hence, the phase separation property of MAPS seems essential for pachynema progression in mouse and human spermatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Functional interactions between cytotoxic T cells and tumor cells are central to anti-cancer immunity. However, our understanding of the proteins involved is limited. Here, we present HySic (hybrid quantification of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture [SILAC]-labeled interacting cells) as a method to quantify protein and phosphorylation dynamics between and within physically interacting cells. Using co-cultured T cells and tumor cells, we directly measure the proteome and phosphoproteome of engaged cells without the need for physical separation. We identify proteins whose abundance or activation status changes upon T cell:tumor cell interaction and validate our method with established signal transduction pathways including interferon γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Furthermore, we identify the RHO/RAC/PAK1 signaling pathway to be activated upon cell engagement and show that pharmacologic inhibition of PAK1 sensitizes tumor cells to T cell killing. Thus, HySic is a simple method to study rapid protein signaling dynamics in physically interacting cells that is easily extended to other biological systems.

Abstract: Summary
While ATM loss of function has long been identified as the genetic cause of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), how it leads to selective and progressive degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons remains unclear. ATM expression is enriched in microglia throughout cerebellar development and adulthood. Here, we find evidence of microglial inflammation in the cerebellum of patients with A-T using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Pseudotime analysis revealed that activation of A-T microglia preceded upregulation of apoptosis-related genes in granule and Purkinje neurons and that microglia exhibited increased neurotoxic cytokine signaling to granule and Purkinje neurons in A-T. To confirm these findings experimentally, we performed transcriptomic profiling of A-T induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia, which revealed cell-intrinsic microglial activation of cytokine production and innate immune response pathways compared to controls. Furthermore, A-T microglia co-culture with either control or A-T iPSC-derived neurons was sufficient to induce cytotoxicity. Taken together, these studies reveal that cell-intrinsic microglial activation may promote neurodegeneration in A-T.

Abstract: Summary
Compounds binding to the bromodomains of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins, particularly BRD4, are promising anticancer agents. Nevertheless, side effects and drug resistance pose significant obstacles in BET-based therapeutics development. Using high-throughput screening of a 200,000-compound library, we identified small molecules targeting a phosphorylated intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of BRD4 that inhibit phospho-BRD4 (pBRD4)-dependent human papillomavirus (HPV) genome replication in HPV-containing keratinocytes. Proteomic profiling identified two DNA damage response factors—53BP1 and BARD1—crucial for differentiation-associated HPV genome amplification. pBRD4-mediated recruitment of 53BP1 and BARD1 to the HPV origin of replication occurs in a spatiotemporal and BRD4 long (BRD4-L) and short (BRD4-S) isoform-specific manner. This recruitment is disrupted by phospho-IDR-targeting compounds with little perturbation of the global transcriptome and BRD4 chromatin landscape. The discovery of these protein-protein interaction inhibitors (PPIi) not only demonstrates the feasibility of developing PPIi against phospho-IDRs but also uncovers antiviral agents targeting an epigenetic regulator essential for virus-host interaction and cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreas development is tightly controlled by multilayer mechanisms. Despite years of effort, large gaps remain in understanding how histone modifications coordinate pancreas development. SETD2, a predominant histone methyltransferase of H3K36me3, plays a key role in embryonic stem cell differentiation, whose role in organogenesis remains elusive. Here, by combination of cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), and bulk RNA sequencing, we show a dramatic increase in the H3K36me3 level from the secondary transition phase and decipher the related transcriptional alteration. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we define that pancreatic deletion of Setd2 results in abnormalities in both exocrine and endocrine lineages: hyperproliferative tip progenitor cells lead to abnormal differentiation; Ngn3+ endocrine progenitors decline due to the downregulation of Nkx2.2, leading to insufficient endocrine development. Thus, these data identify SETD2 as a crucial player in embryonic pancreas development, providing a clue to understanding the dysregulation of histone modifications in pancreatic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and cancer susceptibility. The central FA protein complex FANCI/FANCD2 (ID2) is activated by monoubiquitination and recruits DNA repair proteins for interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair and replication fork protection. Defects in the FA pathway lead to R-loop accumulation, which contributes to genomic instability. Here, we report that the splicing factor SRSF1 and FANCD2 interact physically and act together to suppress R-loop formation via mRNA export regulation. We show that SRSF1 stimulates FANCD2 monoubiquitination in an RNA-dependent fashion. In turn, FANCD2 monoubiquitination proves crucial for the assembly of the SRSF1-NXF1 nuclear export complex and mRNA export. Importantly, several SRSF1 cancer-associated mutants fail to interact with FANCD2, leading to inefficient FANCD2 monoubiquitination, decreased mRNA export, and R-loop accumulation. We propose a model wherein SRSF1 and FANCD2 interaction links DNA damage response to the avoidance of pathogenic R-loops via regulation of mRNA export.

Abstract: Summary
Pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma have poor survival rates and urgently need more effective treatment options with less side effects. Since novel and improved immunotherapies may fill this need, we dissect the immunoregulatory interactions in neuroblastoma by single-cell RNA-sequencing of 24 tumors (10 pre- and 14 post-chemotherapy, including 5 pairs) to identify strategies for optimizing immunotherapy efficacy. Neuroblastomas are infiltrated by natural killer (NK), T and B cells, and immunosuppressive myeloid populations. NK cells show reduced cytotoxicity and T cells have a dysfunctional profile. Interaction analysis reveals a vast immunoregulatory network and identifies NECTIN2-TIGIT as a crucial immune checkpoint. Combined blockade of TIGIT and PD-L1 significantly reduces neuroblastoma growth, with complete responses (CR) in vivo. Moreover, addition of TIGIT+PD-L1 blockade to standard relapse treatment in a chemotherapy-resistant Th-ALKF1174L/MYCN 129/SvJ syngeneic model induces CR. In conclusion, our integrative analysis provides promising targets and a rationale for immunotherapeutic combination strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) regulate cell fate by establishing transcriptionally primed and active states. However, cell fate control requires the coordination of both lineage-specific gene activation and repression of alternative-lineage programs, a process that is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the pioneer TF FOXA coordinates with PRDM1 TF to recruit nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complexes and Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), which establish highly occupied, accessible nucleosome conformation with bivalent epigenetic states, thereby preventing precocious and alternative-lineage gene expression during human endoderm differentiation. Similarly, the pioneer TF OCT4 coordinates with PRDM14 to form bivalent enhancers and repress cell differentiation programs in human pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that this may be a common and critical function of pioneer TFs. We propose that pioneer and PRDM TFs coordinate to safeguard cell fate through epigenetic repression mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosomes, the basic structural units of chromatin, hinder recruitment and activity of various DNA repair proteins, necessitating modifications that enhance DNA accessibility. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of proteins near damage sites is an essential initiation step in several DNA-repair pathways; however, its effects on nucleosome structural dynamics and organization are unclear. Using NMR, cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), and biochemical assays, we show that PARylation enhances motions of the histone H3 tail and DNA, leaving the configuration of the core intact while also stimulating nuclease digestion and ligation of nicked nucleosomal DNA by LIG3. PARylation disrupted interactions between nucleosomes, preventing self-association. Addition of LIG3 and XRCC1 to PARylated nucleosomes generated condensates that selectively partition DNA repair-associated proteins in a PAR- and phosphorylation-dependent manner in vitro. Our results establish that PARylation influences nucleosomes across different length scales, extending from the atom-level motions of histone tails to the mesoscale formation of condensates with selective compositions.

Abstract: Alpinetin has been reported to play a protective role in lung diseases, while its special mechanisms remain indistinct. In this study, acute lung injury (ALI) model was constructed by inducing MLE-12 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cell activity together with apoptosis was judged employing cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry along with western blot. Oxidative stress levels were measured by dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining and corresponding kits. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was to examine the levels of inflammatory factors. The protein expressions of aquaporin-1 (AQP1), p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway were estimated utilizing western blot. The data showed that alpinetin increased the viability, reduced the apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation and inactivated p38 and ERK1/2 signaling in LPS-induced MLE-12 cells. Moreover, alpinetin also increased AQP1 expression and AQP1 knockdown reversed the impacts of alpinetin on LPS-induced MLE-12 cells. Additionally, AQP1 agonist AqF026 also exerted anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells. Evidently, alpinetin may exert its protective role in LPS-induced ALI by inactivation of p38 and ERK1/2 signaling through regulating AQP1.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin loops between gene pairs have been observed in diverse contexts in both flies and vertebrates. Combining high-resolution Capture-C, DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and genetic perturbations, we dissect the functional role of three loops between genes with related function during Drosophila embryogenesis. By mutating the loop anchor (but not the gene) or the gene (but not loop anchor), we disentangle loop formation and gene expression and show that the 3D proximity of paralogous gene loci supports their co-regulation. Breaking the loop leads to either an attenuation or enhancement of expression and perturbs their relative levels of expression and cross-regulation. Although many loops appear constitutive across embryogenesis, their function can change in different developmental contexts. Taken together, our results indicate that chromatin gene-gene loops act as architectural scaffolds that can be used in different ways in different contexts to fine-tune the coordinated expression of genes with related functions and sustain their cross-regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) coordinates co-transcriptional maturation, transport, or degradation of nascent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts. CBC with its partner ARS2 forms mutually exclusive complexes with diverse “effectors” that promote either productive or destructive outcomes. Combining AlphaFold predictions with structural and biochemical validation, we show how effectors NCBP3, NELF-E, ARS2, PHAX, and ZC3H18 form competing binary complexes with CBC and how PHAX, NCBP3, ZC3H18, and other effectors compete for binding to ARS2. In ternary CBC-ARS2 complexes with PHAX, NCBP3, or ZC3H18, ARS2 is responsible for the initial effector recruitment but inhibits their direct binding to the CBC. We show that in vivo ZC3H18 binding to both CBC and ARS2 is required for nuclear RNA degradation. We propose that recruitment of PHAX to CBC-ARS2 can lead, with appropriate cues, to competitive displacement of ARS2 and ZC3H18 from the CBC, thus promoting a productive rather than a degradative RNA fate.

Abstract: Summary
Mitophagy mediated by BNIP3 and NIX critically regulates mitochondrial mass. Cellular BNIP3 and NIX levels are tightly controlled by SCFFBXL4-mediated ubiquitination to prevent excessive mitochondrial loss and lethal disease. Here, we report that knockout of PPTC7, a mitochondrial matrix protein, hyperactivates BNIP3-/NIX-mediated mitophagy and causes perinatal lethality that is rescued by NIX knockout in mice. Biochemically, the PPTC7 precursor is trapped by BNIP3 and NIX to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where PPTC7 scaffolds assembly of a substrate-PPTC7-SCFFBXL4 holocomplex to degrade BNIP3 and NIX, forming a homeostatic regulatory loop. PPTC7 possesses an unusually weak mitochondrial targeting sequence to facilitate its outer membrane retention and mitophagy control. Starvation upregulates PPPTC7 expression in mouse liver to repress mitophagy, which critically maintains hepatic mitochondrial mass, bioenergetics, and gluconeogenesis. Collectively, PPTC7 functions as a mitophagy sensor that integrates homeostatic and physiological signals to dynamically control BNIP3 and NIX degradation, thereby maintaining mitochondrial mass and cellular homeostasis.

Abstract: Prussian blue nanozymes (PBNs) with multiple enzyme activities are prepared and their activities of antitumor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (CEN2) are also explored in this research. On the one hand, it shows that PBNs can exert the catalase-like (CAT-like) activity to decompose hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into non-toxic H2O in CEN2 cells. The O2 release of H2O2 catalysed by PBNs effectively alleviates the hypoxic environment of tumors, which inhibits the glycolysis of tumor and reduces the production of lactic acid. On the other hand, we also find that PBNs also has peroxidase-like (POD-like) enzymatic activity, which can catalyze the production of·OH from H2O2 in tumor cells and result in tumor cell apoptosis. This study lays a solid biomedical foundation for the development of safe and non-toxic nanozymes, as well as the expansion of their application in tumor treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Regulated protein phosphorylation controls most cellular processes. The protein phosphatase PP1 is the catalytic subunit of many holoenzymes that dephosphorylate serine/threonine residues. How these enzymes recruit their substrates is largely unknown. Here, we integrated diverse approaches to elucidate how the PP1 non-catalytic subunit PPP1R15B (R15B) captures its full trimeric eIF2 substrate. We found that the substrate-recruitment module of R15B is largely disordered with three short helical elements, H1, H2, and H3. H1 and H2 form a clamp that grasps the substrate in a region remote from the phosphorylated residue. A homozygous N423D variant, adjacent to H1, reducing substrate binding and dephosphorylation was discovered in a rare syndrome with microcephaly, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. These findings explain how R15B captures its 125 kDa substrate by binding the far end of the complex relative to the phosphosite to present it for dephosphorylation by PP1, a paradigm of broad relevance.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between lineage-determining and activity-dependent transcription factors determine single-cell identity and function within multicellular tissues through incompletely known mechanisms. By assembling a single-cell atlas of chromatin state within human islets, we identified β cell subtypes governed by either high or low activity of the lineage-determining factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1). β cells with reduced PDX1 activity displayed increased chromatin accessibility at latent nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) enhancers. Pdx1 hypomorphic mice exhibited de-repression of NF-κB and impaired glucose tolerance at night. Three-dimensional analyses in tandem with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing revealed that PDX1 silences NF-κB at circadian and inflammatory enhancers through long-range chromatin contacts involving SIN3A. Conversely, Bmal1 ablation in β cells disrupted genome-wide PDX1 and NF-κB DNA binding. Finally, antagonizing the interleukin (IL)-1β receptor, an NF-κB target, improved insulin secretion in Pdx1 hypomorphic islets. Our studies reveal functional subtypes of single β cells defined by a gradient in PDX1 activity and identify NF-κB as a target for insulinotropic therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Complement is a fundamental innate immune response component. Its alterations are associated with severe systemic diseases. To illuminate the complement’s genetic underpinnings, we conduct genome-wide association studies of the functional activity of the classical (CP), lectin (LP), and alternative (AP) complement pathways in the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol study (n = 4,990). We identify seven loci, encompassing 13 independent, pathway-specific variants located in or near complement genes (CFHR4, C7, C2, MBL2) and non-complement genes (PDE3A, TNXB, ABO), explaining up to 74% of complement pathways’ genetic heritability and implicating long-range haplotypes associated with LP at MBL2. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses, supported by transcriptome- and proteome-wide colocalization, confirm known causal pathways, establish within-complement feedback loops, and implicate causality of ABO on LP and of CFHR2 and C7 on AP. LP causally influences collectin-11 and KAAG1 levels and the risk of mouth ulcers. These results build a comprehensive resource to investigate the role of complement in human health.

Abstract: Summary
Blood flow is known to regulate cerebrovascular development through acting on vascular endothelial cells (ECs). As an indispensable component of the neurovascular unit, brain pericytes physically couple with ECs and play vital roles in blood-brain barrier integrity maintenance and neurovascular coupling. However, it remains unclear whether blood flow affects brain pericyte development. Using in vivo time-lapse imaging of larval zebrafish, we monitored the developmental dynamics of brain pericytes and found that they proliferate to expand their population and increase their coverage to brain vessels. In combination with pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrated that blood flow enhances brain pericyte proliferation through Piezo1 expressed in ECs. Moreover, we identified that EC-intrinsic Notch signaling is downstream of Piezo1 to promote the activation of Notch signaling in pericytes.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms by which lymphatic vessels induce cell contact inhibition are not understood. Here, we identify the cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A) as a selective regulator of lymphatic but not of blood endothelial contact inhibition. Conditional deletion of Pde2a in mouse embryos reveals severe lymphatic dysplasia, whereas blood vessel architecture remains unaltered. In the absence of PDE2A, human lymphatic endothelial cells fail to induce mature junctions and cell cycle arrest, whereas cGMP levels, but not cAMP levels, are increased. Loss of PDE2A-mediated cGMP hydrolysis leads to the activation of p38 signaling and downregulation of NOTCH signaling. However, DLL4-induced NOTCH activation restores junctional maturation and contact inhibition in PDE2A-deficient human lymphatic endothelial cells. In postnatal mouse mesenteries, PDE2A is specifically enriched in collecting lymphatic valves, and loss of Pde2a results in the formation of abnormal valves. Our data demonstrate that PDE2A selectively finetunes a crosstalk of cGMP, p38, and NOTCH signaling during lymphatic vessel maturation.
