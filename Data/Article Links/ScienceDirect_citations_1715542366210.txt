Abstract: Summary
Molecular processes involving lncRNAs regulate cell function. By applying transcriptomics, we identify lncRNAs whose expression is regulated by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Upon silencing individual lncRNAs, we identify several that regulate TGF-β signaling. Among these lncRNAs, TGFB2-antisense RNA1 (TGFB2-AS1) is induced by TGF-β through Smad and protein kinase pathways and resides in the nucleus. Depleting TGFB2-AS1 enhances TGF-β/Smad-mediated transcription and expression of hallmark TGF-β-target genes. Increased dose of TGFB2-AS1 reduces expression of these genes, attenuates TGF-β-induced cell growth arrest, and alters BMP and Wnt pathway gene profiles. Mechanistically, TGFB2-AS1, mainly via its 3′ terminal region, binds to the EED adaptor of the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), promoting repressive histone H3K27me3 modifications at TGF-β-target gene promoters. Silencing EED or inhibiting PRC2 methylation activity partially rescues TGFB2-AS1-mediated gene repression. Thus, the TGF-β-induced TGFB2-AS1 lncRNA exerts inhibitory functions on TGF-β/BMP signaling output, supporting auto-regulatory negative feedback that balances TGF-β/BMP-mediated responses.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostatic renewal and stress-related tissue regeneration rely on stem cell activity, which drives the replacement of damaged cells to maintain tissue integrity and function. The Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway has been established as a critical regulator of tissue homeostasis both in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and mature enterocytes (ECs), while its chronic activation has been linked to tissue degeneration and aging. Here, we show that JNK signaling requires the stress-inducible transcription factor Ets21c to promote tissue renewal in Drosophila. We demonstrate that Ets21c controls ISC proliferation as well as EC apoptosis through distinct sets of target genes that orchestrate cellular behaviors via intrinsic and non-autonomous signaling mechanisms. While its loss appears dispensable for development and prevents epithelial aging, ISCs and ECs demand Ets21c function to mount cellular responses to oxidative stress. Ets21c thus emerges as a vital regulator of proliferative homeostasis in the midgut and a determinant of the adult healthspan.

Abstract: Summary
Vesicle budding for Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking is a key step in secretion. Proteins that induce curvature of the Golgi membrane are predicted to be required, by analogy to vesicle budding from other membranes. Here, we demonstrate that GOLPH3, upon binding to the phosphoinositide PI4P, induces curvature of synthetic membranes in vitro and the Golgi in cells. Moreover, efficient Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking critically depends on the ability of GOLPH3 to curve the Golgi membrane. Interestingly, uncoupling of GOLPH3 from its binding partner MYO18A results in extensive curvature of Golgi membranes, producing dramatic tubulation of the Golgi, but does not support forward trafficking. Thus, forward trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane requires the ability of GOLPH3 both to induce Golgi membrane curvature and to recruit MYO18A. These data provide fundamental insight into the mechanism of Golgi trafficking and into the function of the unique Golgi secretory oncoproteins GOLPH3 and MYO18A.

Abstract: Summary
MAIT cells are an unconventional T cell population that can be activated through both TCR-dependent and TCR-independent mechanisms. Here, we examined the impact of combinations of TCR-dependent and TCR-independent signals in human CD8+ MAIT cells. TCR-independent activation of these MAIT cells from blood and gut was maximized by extending the panel of cytokines to include TNF-superfamily member TL1A. RNA-seq experiments revealed that TCR-dependent and TCR-independent signals drive MAIT cells to exert overlapping and specific effector functions, affecting both host defense and tissue homeostasis. Although TCR triggering alone is insufficient to drive sustained activation, TCR-triggered MAIT cells showed specific enrichment of tissue-repair functions at the gene and protein levels and in in vitro assays. Altogether, these data indicate the blend of TCR-dependent and TCR-independent signaling to CD8+ MAIT cells may play a role in controlling the balance between healthy and pathological processes of tissue inflammation and repair.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1α) is an indispensable step in remedying the cellular stress associated with lipid perturbation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. IRE1α is a single-spanning ER transmembrane protein possessing both kinase and endonuclease functions, and its activation can be fully achieved through the dimerization and/or oligomerization process. How IRE1α senses membrane lipid saturation remains largely unresolved. Using both computational and experimental tools, we systematically investigated the dimerization process of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of IRE1α and found that, with help of the serine 450 residue, the conserved tryptophan 457 residue buttresses the core dimerization interface of IRE1α-TMD. BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) experiments revealed that mutation on these residues abolished the saturated fatty acid-induced dimerization in the ER membrane and subsequently inactivated IRE1α activity in vivo. Therefore, our results suggest that the structural elements of IRE1α-TMD serve as a key sensor that detects membrane aberrancy.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-38 (IL-38) is a cytokine of the IL-1 family with a role in chronic inflammation. However, its main cellular targets and receptors remain obscure. IL-38 is highly expressed in the skin and downregulated in psoriasis patients. We report an investigation in cellular targets of IL-38 during the progression of imiquimod-induced psoriasis. In this model, IL-38 knockout (IL-38 KO) mice show delayed disease resolution with exacerbated IL-17-mediated inflammation, which is reversed by the administration of mature IL-38 or γδ T cell-receptor-blocking antibodies. Mechanistically, X-linked IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1) is upregulated upon γδ T cell activation to feedforward-amplify IL-17 production and is required for IL-38 to suppress γδ T cell IL-17 production. Accordingly, psoriatic IL1RAPL1 KO mice show reduced inflammation and IL-17 production by γδ T cells. Our findings indicate a role for IL-38 in the regulation of γδ T cell activation through IL1RAPL1, with consequences for auto-inflammatory disease.

Abstract: Summary
Lung inflammation induced by silica impairs host control of tuberculosis, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that silica-driven exacerbation of M. tuberculosis infection associates with raised type 2 immunity. Silica increases pulmonary Th2 cell and M2 macrophage responses, while reducing type 1 immunity after M. tuberculosis infection. Silica induces lung damage that prompts extracellular self-DNA release and activates STING. This STING priming potentiates M. tuberculosis DNA sensing by and activation of cGAS/STING, which triggers enhanced type I interferon (IFNI) response and type 2 immunity. cGAS-, STING-, and IFNAR-deficient mice are resistant to silica-induced exacerbation of M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, silica-induced self-DNA primes the host response to M. tuberculosis-derived nucleic acids, which increases type 2 immunity while reducing type 1 immunity, crucial for controlling M. tuberculosis infection. These data show how cGAS/STING pathway activation, at the crossroads of sterile inflammation and infection, may affect the host response to pathogens such as M. tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
During oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), Candida albicans proliferates and invades the superficial oral epithelium. Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) functions as an oral epithelial cell β-glucan receptor that triggers the production of proinflammatory mediators in response to fungal infection. Because EphA2 is also expressed by neutrophils, we investigated its role in neutrophil candidacidal activity during OPC. We found that EphA2 on stromal cells is required for the accumulation of phagocytes in the oral mucosa of mice with OPC. EphA2 on neutrophils is also central to host defense against OPC. The interaction of neutrophil EphA2 with serum-opsonized C. albicans yeast activates the MEK-ERK signaling pathway, leading to NADPH subunit p47phox site-specific phospho-priming. This priming increases intracellular reactive oxygen species production and enhances fungal killing. Thus, in neutrophils, EphA2 serves as a receptor for β-glucans that augments Fcγ receptor-mediated antifungal activity and controls early fungal proliferation during OPC.

Abstract: Summary
The V1V2 region of the HIV-1 envelope is the target of several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Antibodies to V1V2 elicited in the RV144 clinical trial correlated with a reduced risk of HIV infection, but these antibodies were without broad neutralizing activity. Antibodies targeting V1V2 also correlated with a reduced viral load in immunized macaques challenged with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). To focus immune responses on V1V2, we engrafted the native, glycosylated V1V2 domain onto five different multimeric scaffold proteins and conducted comparative immunogenicity studies in macaques. Vaccinated macaques developed high titers of plasma and mucosal antibodies that targeted structurally distinct V1V2 epitopes. Plasma antibodies displayed limited neutralizing activity but were functionally active for ADCC and phagocytosis, which was detectable 1–2 years after immunizations ended. This study demonstrates that multivalent, glycosylated V1V2-scaffold protein immunogens focus the antibody response on V1V2 and are differentially effective at inducing polyfunctional antibodies with characteristics associated with protection.

Abstract: Summary
Several oncogenes induce untimely entry into S phase and alter replication timing and progression, thereby generating replicative stress, a well-known source of genomic instability and a hallmark of cancer. Using an epithelial model in Drosophila, we show that the RAS oncogene, which triggers G1/S transition, induces DNA damage and, at the same time, silences the DNA damage response pathway. RAS compromises ATR-mediated phosphorylation of the histone variant H2Av and ATR-mediated cell-cycle arrest in G2 and blocks, through ERK, Dp53-dependent induction of cell death. We found that ERK is also activated in normal tissues by an exogenous source of damage and that this activation is necessary to dampen the pro-apoptotic role of Dp53. We exploit the pro-survival role of ERK activation upon endogenous and exogenous sources of DNA damage to present evidence that its genetic or chemical inhibition can be used as a therapeutic opportunity to selectively eliminate RAS-malignant tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential for complex molecular responses to physiological insult and disease. Although many disease-associated miRNAs are known, their global targets and culminating network effects on pathophysiology remain poorly understood. We applied Argonaute (AGO) crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) to systematically elucidate altered miRNA-target interactions in brain following ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. Among 1,190 interactions identified, the most prominent was the cumulative loss of target regulation by miR-29 family members. Integration of translational and time-course RNA profiles revealed a dynamic mode of miR-29 target de-regulation, led by acute translational activation and a later increase in RNA levels, allowing rapid proteomic changes to take effect. These functional regulatory events rely on canonical and non-canonical miR-29 binding and engage glutamate reuptake signals, such as glial glutamate transporter (GLT-1), to control local glutamate levels. These results uncover a miRNA target network that acts acutely to maintain brain homeostasis after ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Hcr1/eIF3j is a sub-stoichiometric subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) that can dissociate the post-termination 40S ribosomal subunit from mRNA in vitro. We examine this ribosome recycling role in vivo by ribosome profiling and reporter assays and find that loss of Hcr1 leads to reinitiation of translation in 3′ UTRs, consistent with a defect in recycling. However, the defect appears to be in the recycling of the 60S subunit, rather than the 40S subunit, because reinitiation does not require an AUG codon and is suppressed by overexpression of the 60S dissociation factor Rli1/ABCE1. Consistent with a 60S recycling role, overexpression of Hcr1 cannot compensate for loss of 40S recycling factors Tma64/eIF2D and Tma20/MCT-1. Intriguingly, loss of Hcr1 triggers greater expression of RLI1 via an apparent feedback loop. These findings suggest Hcr1/eIF3j is recruited to ribosomes at stop codons and may coordinate the transition to a new round of translation.

Abstract: Summary
Biological roles for most long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) remain mysterious. Here, using forward genetics, we identify lep-5, a lncRNA acting in the C. elegans heterochronic (developmental timing) pathway. Loss of lep-5 delays hypodermal maturation and male tail tip morphogenesis (TTM), hallmarks of the juvenile-to-adult transition. We find that lep-5 is a ∼600 nt cytoplasmic RNA that is conserved across Caenorhabditis and possesses three essential secondary structure motifs but no essential open reading frames. lep-5 expression is temporally controlled, peaking prior to TTM onset. Like the Makorin LEP-2, lep-5 facilitates the degradation of LIN-28, a conserved miRNA regulator specifying the juvenile state. Both LIN-28 and LEP-2 associate with lep-5 in vivo, suggesting that lep-5 directly regulates LIN-28 stability and may function as an RNA scaffold. These studies identify a key biological role for a lncRNA: by regulating protein stability, it provides a temporal cue to facilitate the juvenile-to-adult transition.

Abstract: The effect of the GM6001 metalloproteinase inhibitor on the regeneration of ambulacral structures in Eupentacta fraudatrix has been investigated. Inhibition of proteinase activity exerts a marked effect on regeneration, being dependent on the time when GM6001 is injected. When administration of the inhibitor begins on day 3 post-injury, regeneration is completely abolished, and the animals die. This means that early activation of proteinases is crucial for triggering the regenerative process in holothurians. When GM6001 in first injected on day 7 post-injury, the regeneration rate decreases. However, this effect has proven to be reversible: when inhibition ceases, the regeneration resumes. The effect of the inhibitor is manifested as a retarded degradation of the extracellular matrix, the lack of cell dedifferentiation, and, probably, a slower cell migration. The gelatinase activity is detected in all the regenerating organs of E. fraudatrix. In the holothurian Cucumaria japonica, which is not capable of healing skin wounds and ambulacrum reparation, no gelatinase activity was observed at the site of damage. A suggestion is made that proteinases play an important role in regeneration in holothurians. The most probable morphogenesis regulators are matrix metalloproteinases with gelatinase activity.

Abstract: Summary
Many viruses shut off host gene expression to inhibit antiviral responses. Viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are typically spared in this process, but the mechanisms of target selectivity during host shutoff remain poorly understood. Using transcriptome-wide and targeted reporter experiments, we demonstrate that the influenza A virus endoribonuclease PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. Proximity-labeling proteomics reveals that PA-X interacts with cellular RNA processing proteins, some of which are partially required for host shutoff. Thus, PA-X taps into host nuclear pre-mRNA processing mechanisms to destroy nascent mRNAs shortly after their synthesis. This mechanism sets PA-X apart from other viral host shutoff proteins that target actively translating mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Our study reveals a unique mechanism of host shutoff that helps us understand how influenza viruses suppress host gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, many cancers are resistant to ICIs, and the targeting of additional inhibitory signals is crucial for limiting tumor evasion. The production of adenosine via the sequential activity of CD39 and CD73 ectoenzymes participates to the generation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In order to disrupt the adenosine pathway, we generated two antibodies, IPH5201 and IPH5301, targeting human membrane-associated and soluble forms of CD39 and CD73, respectively, and efficiently blocking the hydrolysis of immunogenic ATP into immunosuppressive adenosine. These antibodies promoted antitumor immunity by stimulating dendritic cells and macrophages and by restoring the activation of T cells isolated from cancer patients. In a human CD39 knockin mouse preclinical model, IPH5201 increased the anti-tumor activity of the ATP-inducing chemotherapeutic drug oxaliplatin. These results support the use of anti-CD39 and anti-CD73 monoclonal antibodies and their combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapies in cancer.

Suppressing Mitochondrial Respiration Is Critical for Hypoxia Tolerance in the Fetal Growth Plate,

Abstract: Summary
Oxygen (O2) is both an indispensable metabolic substrate and a regulatory signal that controls the activity of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (Hif1a), a mediator of the cellular adaptation to low O2 tension (hypoxia). Hypoxic cells require Hif1a to survive. Additionally, Hif1a is an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. Hence, we hypothesized that enhancing mitochondrial respiration is detrimental to the survival of hypoxic cells in vivo. We tested this hypothesis in the fetal growth plate, which is hypoxic. Our findings show that mitochondrial respiration is dispensable for survival of growth plate chondrocytes. Furthermore, its impairment prevents the extreme hypoxia and the massive chondrocyte death observed in growth plates lacking Hif1a. Consequently, augmenting mitochondrial respiration affects the survival of hypoxic chondrocytes by, at least in part, increasing intracellular hypoxia. We thus propose that partial suppression of mitochondrial respiration is crucial during development to protect the tissues that are physiologically hypoxic from lethal intracellular anoxia.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of lineage priming in embryonic development are largely uncharacterized because of the difficulty of isolating transient progenitor populations. Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) combined with gene editing provides a powerful system to define precise temporal gene requirements for progressive chromatin changes during cell fate transitions. Here, we map the dynamic chromatin landscape associated with sequential stages of pancreatic differentiation from hPSCs. Our analysis of chromatin accessibility dynamics led us to uncover a requirement for FOXA2, known as a pioneer factor, in human pancreas specification not previously shown from mouse knockout studies. FOXA2 knockout hPSCs formed reduced numbers of pancreatic progenitors accompanied by impaired recruitment of GATA6 to pancreatic enhancers. Furthermore, FOXA2 is required for proper chromatin remodeling and H3K4me1 deposition during enhancer priming. This work highlights the power of combining hPSC differentiation, genome editing, and computational genomics for discovering transcriptional mechanisms during development.

Abstract: Summary
Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays crucial roles in patterning the ventral neural tube, which is transformed into opposing gradients of repressor and activator forms of Glis. Here, we show that the fine-tuning of the shape of the Gli gradients through non-proteolytic ubiquitination-mediated nuclear exportation plays an important role in the control of local neural cell fate. Loss of RNF220, a ventral neural-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase, leads to ventral expansion of the intermediate V0 and dorsal expansion of the ventral V3 neurons, while reducing the V1, V2, and motor neurons between them. We show that RNF220 interacts with all Glis, either in their activator or repressor forms; induces their K63-linked ubiquitination; and promotes their nuclear export, likely by unmasking a nuclear export signal in the zinc finger domain. We propose that RNF220 works to refine the Gli gradients during neural patterning by limiting the effective Gli levels in the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Adult stem cells reactivate from quiescence to maintain tissue homeostasis and in response to injury. How the underlying regulatory signals are integrated is largely unknown. Drosophila neural stem cells (NSCs) also leave quiescence to generate adult neurons and glia, a process that is dependent on Hippo signaling inhibition and activation of the insulin-like receptor (InR)/PI3K/Akt cascade. We performed a transcriptome analysis of individual quiescent and reactivating NSCs harvested directly from Drosophila brains and identified the conserved STRIPAK complex members mob4, cka, and PP2A (microtubule star, mts). We show that PP2A/Mts phosphatase, with its regulatory subunit Widerborst, maintains NSC quiescence, preventing premature activation of InR/PI3K/Akt signaling. Conversely, an increase in Mob4 and Cka levels promotes NSC reactivation. Mob4 and Cka are essential to recruit PP2A/Mts into a complex with Hippo kinase, resulting in Hippo pathway inhibition. We propose that Mob4/Cka/Mts functions as an intrinsic molecular switch coordinating Hippo and InR/PI3K/Akt pathways and enabling NSC reactivation.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of glucose metabolism on muscle regeneration remains unresolved. We identify glucose metabolism as a crucial driver of histone acetylation and myogenic cell fate. We use single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to characterize the histone acetylation and metabolic states of quiescent, activated, and differentiating muscle stem cells (MuSCs). We find glucose is dispensable for mitochondrial respiration in proliferating MuSCs, so that glucose becomes available for maintaining high histone acetylation via acetyl-CoA. Conversely, quiescent and differentiating MuSCs increase glucose utilization for respiration and have consequently reduced acetylation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity serves as a rheostat for histone acetylation and must be controlled for muscle regeneration. Increased PDH activity in proliferation increases histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility at genes that must be silenced for differentiation to proceed, and thus promotes self-renewal. These results highlight metabolism as a determinant of MuSC histone acetylation, fate, and function during muscle regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebellum has long been implicated in tasks involving precise temporal control, especially in the coordination of movements. Here we asked whether the cerebellum represents temporal aspects of oscillatory neuronal activity, measured as instantaneous phase and difference between instantaneous phases of oscillations in two cerebral cortical areas involved in cognitive function. We simultaneously recorded Purkinje cell (PC) single-unit spike activity in cerebellar lobulus simplex (LS) and Crus I and local field potential (LFP) activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus CA1 region (dCA1). Purkinje cells in cerebellar LS and Crus I differentially represented specific phases and phase differences of mPFC and dCA1 LFP oscillations in a frequency-specific manner, suggesting a site- and frequency-specific cerebellar representation of temporal aspects of neuronal oscillations in non-motor cerebral cortical areas. These findings suggest that cerebellar interactions with cerebral cortical areas involved in cognitive functions might involve temporal coordination of neuronal oscillations.

Abstract: Summary
Visual information is processed in the cortex by ON and OFF pathways that respond to light and dark stimuli. Responses to darks are stronger, faster, and driven by a larger number of cortical neurons than responses to lights. Here, we demonstrate that these light-dark cortical asymmetries reflect a functional specialization of ON and OFF pathways for different stimulus properties. We show that large long-lasting stimuli drive stronger cortical responses when they are light, whereas small fast stimuli drive stronger cortical responses when they are dark. Moreover, we show that these light-dark asymmetries are preserved under a wide variety of luminance conditions that range from photopic to low mesopic light. Our results suggest that ON and OFF pathways extract different spatiotemporal information from visual scenes, making OFF local-fast signals better suited to maximize visual acuity and ON global-slow signals better suited to guide the eye movements needed for retinal image stabilization.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor eradication may be greatly improved by targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs), as they exhibit resistance to conventional therapy. To gain insight into the unique biology of CSCs, we developed patient-derived xenograft tumors (PDXs) from ER− breast cancers from which we isolated mammospheres that are enriched for CSCs. Comparative global proteomic analysis was performed on patient tumor tissues and corresponding PDXs and mammospheres. Mammospheres exhibited increased expression of proteins associated with de novo cholesterol synthesis. The clinical relevance of increased cholesterol biosynthesis was verified in a large breast cancer cohort showing correlation with shorter relapse-free survival. RNAi and chemical inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway reduced mammosphere formation, which could be rescued by a downstream metabolite. Our findings identify the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as central for CSC propagation and a potential therapeutic target, as well as providing a mechanistic explanation for the therapeutic benefit of statins in breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Overeating is a serious issue in modern society, causing many health problems, including obesity. Although the hypothalamus has been previously identified as the key brain structure that regulates body weight homeostasis, the downstream pathways and non-canonical neural circuitry involved in feeding behavior remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we discover that suppressing the activity of GABAergic cells in the anterior ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), whether directly or through long-projection GABAergic inputs from either the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the lateral hypothalamus (LH), is sufficient to promptly induce feeding behavior in well-fed mice. In contrast, optogenetic activation of these cells interrupts food intake in starved mice. Long-term chemogenetic manipulation of vlPAG GABAergic cell activity elicits a corresponding change in mouse body weight. Our studies reveal distinct midbrain GABAergic pathways and highlight an important role of GABAergic cells in the anterior vlPAG in feeding behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The canonical cortical microcircuit has principally been defined by interlaminar excitatory connections among the six layers of the neocortex. However, excitatory neurons in layer 6 (L6), a layer whose functional organization is poorly understood, form relatively rare synaptic connections with other cortical excitatory neurons. Here, we show that the vast majority of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in a sublamina within L6 send axons through the cortical layers toward the pia. These interlaminar inhibitory neurons receive local synaptic inputs from both major types of L6 excitatory neurons and receive stronger input from thalamocortical afferents than do neighboring pyramidal neurons. The distribution of these interlaminar interneurons and their synaptic connectivity further support a functional subdivision within the standard six layers of the cortex. Positioned to integrate local and long-distance inputs in this sublayer, these interneurons generate an inhibitory interlaminar output. These findings call for a revision to the canonical cortical microcircuit.

Abstract: Summary
Orderly segregation of chromosomes during meiosis requires that crossovers form between homologous chromosomes by recombination. Programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate meiotic recombination. We identify ANKRD31 as a key component of complexes of DSB-promoting proteins that assemble on meiotic chromosome axes. Genome-wide, ANKRD31 deficiency causes delayed recombination initiation. In addition, loss of ANKRD31 alters DSB distribution because of reduced selectivity for sites that normally attract DSBs. Strikingly, ANKRD31 deficiency also abolishes uniquely high rates of recombination that normally characterize pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of X and Y chromosomes. Consequently, sex chromosomes do not form crossovers, leading to chromosome segregation failure in ANKRD31-deficient spermatocytes. These defects co-occur with a genome-wide delay in assembling DSB-promoting proteins on autosome axes and loss of a specialized PAR-axis domain that is highly enriched for DSB-promoting proteins in wild type. Thus, we propose a model for spatiotemporal patterning of recombination by ANKRD31-dependent control of axis-associated DSB-promoting proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The condensin protein complex plays a key role in the structural organization of genomes. How the ATPase activity of its SMC subunits drives large-scale changes in chromosome topology has remained unknown. Here we reconstruct, at near-atomic resolution, the sequence of events that take place during the condensin ATPase cycle. We show that ATP binding induces a conformational switch in the Smc4 head domain that releases its hitherto undescribed interaction with the Ycs4 HEAT-repeat subunit and promotes its engagement with the Smc2 head into an asymmetric heterodimer. SMC head dimerization subsequently enables nucleotide binding at the second active site and disengages the Brn1 kleisin subunit from the Smc2 coiled coil to open the condensin ring. These large-scale transitions in the condensin architecture lay out a mechanistic path for its ability to extrude DNA helices into large loop structures.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid granules rich in intrinsically disordered proteins and RNA play key roles in critical cellular functions such as RNA processing and translation. Many details of the mechanism via which this occurs remain to be elucidated. Motivated by the lacuna in the field and by the prospects of developing de novo artificial granules that provide extrinsic control of translation, we report a bottom-up approach to engineer ribonucleoprotein granules composed of a recombinant RNA-binding IDP that exhibits phase behavior in water. We developed a kinetic model to illustrate that these granules inhibit translation through reversible or irreversible sequestration of mRNA. Within monodisperse droplets capable of transcription and translation, we experimentally demonstrate temporal inhibition of translation by using designer IDPs that exhibit tunable phase behavior. This work lays the foundation for developing artificial granules that promise to further our mechanistic understanding of their naturally occurring counterparts.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated movements are achieved by well-timed activation of selected muscles. This process relies on intact cerebellar circuitry, as demonstrated by motor impairments following cerebellar lesions. Based on anatomical connectivity and symptoms observed in cerebellar patients, we hypothesized that cerebellar dysfunction should disrupt the temporal patterns of motor cortical activity, but not the selected motor plan. To test this hypothesis, we reversibly blocked cerebellar outflow in primates while monitoring motor behavior and neural activity. This manipulation replicated the impaired motor timing and coordination characteristic of cerebellar ataxia. We found extensive changes in motor cortical activity, including loss of response transients at movement onset and decoupling of task-related activity. Nonetheless, the spatial tuning of cells was unaffected, and their early preparatory activity was mostly intact. These results indicate that the timing of actions, but not the selection of muscles, is regulated through cerebellar control of motor cortical activity.

Abstract: Summary
2′3′-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is a second messenger that activates the antiviral stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. We recently identified a novel role for cGAMP as a soluble, extracellular immunotransmitter that is produced and secreted by cancer cells. Secreted cGAMP is then sensed by host cells, eliciting an antitumoral immune response. Due to the antitumoral effects of cGAMP, other CDN-based STING agonists are currently under investigation in clinical trials for metastatic solid tumors. However, it is unknown how cGAMP and other CDNs cross the cell membrane to activate intracellular STING. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified SLC19A1 as the first known importer of cGAMP and other CDNs, including the investigational new drug 2′3′-bisphosphosphothioate-cyclic-di-AMP (2′3′-CDAS). These discoveries will provide insight into cGAMP’s role as an immunotransmitter and aid in the development of more targeted CDN-based cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Classical activation of macrophages (M(LPS+IFNγ)) elicits the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), generating large amounts of NO and inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Upregulation of glycolysis and a disrupted tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle underpin this switch to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. We show that the NOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) modulates IL-1β production and key aspects of metabolic remodeling in activated murine macrophages via NO production. Using two complementary genetic models, we reveal that NO modulates levels of the essential TCA cycle metabolites citrate and succinate, as well as the inflammatory mediator itaconate. Furthermore, NO regulates macrophage respiratory function via changes in the abundance of critical N-module subunits in Complex I. However, NO-deficient cells can still upregulate glycolysis despite changes in the abundance of glycolytic intermediates and proteins involved in glucose metabolism. Our findings reveal a fundamental role for iNOS-derived NO in regulating metabolic remodeling and cytokine production in the pro-inflammatory macrophage.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular and molecular profiles that govern the endothelial heterogeneity of the circulatory system have yet to be elucidated. Using a data-driven approach to study the endothelial compartment via single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized cell subpopulations within and assigned them to a defined endothelial hierarchy. We show that two transcriptionally distinct endothelial populations exist within the aorta and, using two independent trajectory analysis methods, confirm that they represent transitioning cells rather than discrete cell types. Gene co-expression analysis revealed crucial regulatory networks underlying each population, including significant metabolic gene networks in progenitor cells. Using mitochondrial activity assays and phenotyping, we confirm that endovascular progenitors display higher mitochondrial content compared to differentiated endothelial cells. The identities of these populations were further validated against bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data obtained from normal and tumor-derived vasculature. Our findings validate the heterogeneity of the aortic endothelium and previously suggested hierarchy between progenitor and differentiated cells.

Abstract: Summary
While the timing of food intake is important, it is unclear whether the effects of exercise on energy metabolism are restricted to unique time windows. As circadian regulation is key to controlling metabolism, understanding the impact of exercise performed at different times of the day is relevant for physiology and homeostasis. Using high-throughput transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, we identify distinct responses of metabolic oscillations that characterize exercise in either the early rest phase or the early active phase in mice. Notably, glycolytic activation is specific to exercise at the active phase. At the molecular level, HIF1α, a central regulator of glycolysis during hypoxia, is selectively activated in a time-dependent manner upon exercise, resulting in carbohydrate exhaustion, usage of alternative energy sources, and adaptation of systemic energy expenditure. Our findings demonstrate that the time of day is a critical factor to amplify the beneficial impact of exercise on both metabolic pathways within skeletal muscle and systemic energy homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, modulate multiple aspects of cancer biology. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) secrete EVs, but their molecular features and functions are poorly characterized. Here, we report methodology for the enrichment, quantification, and proteomic and lipidomic analysis of EVs released from mouse TAMs (TAM-EVs). Compared to source TAMs, TAM-EVs present molecular profiles associated with a Th1/M1 polarization signature, enhanced inflammation and immune response, and a more favorable patient prognosis. Accordingly, enriched TAM-EV preparations promote T cell proliferation and activation ex vivo. TAM-EVs also contain bioactive lipids and biosynthetic enzymes, which may alter pro-inflammatory signaling in the cancer cells. Thus, whereas TAMs are largely immunosuppressive, their EVs may have the potential to stimulate, rather than limit, anti-tumor immunity.

The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a master regulator of cell homeostasis, which promotes anabolic reactions and synchronously inhibits catabolic processes such as autophagy-mediated protein degradation. Its prime autophagy target is Atg13, a subunit of the Atg1 kinase complex that acts as the gatekeeper of canonical autophagy. To study whether the activities of TORC1 and Atg1 are coupled through additional, more intricate control mechanisms than simply this linear pathway, we analyzed the epistatic relationship between TORC1 and Atg1 by using quantitative phosphoproteomics. Our in vivo data, combined with targeted in vitro TORC1 and Atg1 kinase assays, not only uncover numerous TORC1 and Atg1 effectors, but also suggest distinct bi-directional regulatory feedback loops and characterize Atg29 as a commonly regulated downstream target of both TORC1 and Atg1. Thus, an exquisitely multilayered regulatory network appears to coordinate TORC1 and Atg1 activities to robustly tune autophagy in response to nutritional cues.

Abstract: Summary
Mucosal immune responses to HIV-1 involve the recognition of the viral envelope glycoprotein (gp)160 by tissue-resident B cells and subsequent secretion of antibodies. To characterize the B cells “sensing” HIV-1 in the gut of infected individuals, we probed monoclonal antibodies produced from single intestinal B cells binding to recombinant gp140 trimers. A large fraction of mucosal B cell antibodies were polyreactive and showed only low affinity to HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, particularly the gp41 moiety. A few high-affinity gp140 antibodies were isolated but lacked neutralizing, potent ADCC, and transcytosis-blocking capacities. Instead, they displayed cross-reactivity with defined self-antigens. Specifically, intestinal HIV-1 gp41 antibodies targeting the heptad repeat 2 region (HR2) cluster II cross-reacted with the p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14). Hence, physiologic polyreactivity of intestinal B cells and molecular mimicry-based self-reactivity of HIV-1 antibodies are two independent phenomena, possibly diverting and/or impairing mucosal humoral immunity to HIV-1.

Abstract: Summary
The neural stem cell (NSC) reservoir can be harnessed for stem cell-based regenerative therapies. Zebrafish remarkably regenerate their brain by inducing NSC plasticity in a Amyloid-β-42 (Aβ42)-induced experimental Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is also critical for AD-induced NSC proliferation. However, the mechanisms of this response have remained unknown. Using single-cell transcriptomics in the adult zebrafish brain, we identify distinct subtypes of NSCs and neurons and differentially regulated pathways and their gene ontologies and investigate how cell-cell communication is altered through ligand-receptor pairs in AD conditions. Our results propose the existence of heterogeneous and spatially organized stem cell populations that react distinctly to amyloid toxicity. This resource article provides an extensive database for the molecular basis of NSC plasticity in the AD model of the adult zebrafish brain. Further analyses of stem cell heterogeneity and neuro-regenerative ability at single-cell resolution could yield drug targets for mobilizing NSCs for endogenous neuro-regeneration in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis of wavy epidermal pavement cells in plants has fascinated researchers for decades. A mechanical mechanism had been proposed in which the anticlinal cell walls, forming the in-plane cell borders, feature contiguous stiff and soft zones that generate waves upon stretching. We replicated this model as designed and also expanded on it to test its validity for three-dimensional (3D) cell geometry. Our results suggest that both the assumptions going into and the predictions arising from this hypothesis do not stand closer scrutiny and may misguide experimentalists. Unlike what the published data seem to suggest, we observed that only waves of negligible magnitude can be formed by this anticlinal stretch model and that these are virtually eliminated when full 3D geometry of the cell is considered. Further, the model produces cell wall stresses that do not match the experimental evidence.

Abstract: Summary
The microRNAs encoded by the miR-17∼92 polycistron are commonly overexpressed in cancer and orchestrate a wide range of oncogenic functions. Here, we identify a mechanism for miR-17∼92 oncogenic function through the disruption of endogenous microRNA (miRNA) processing. We show that, upon oncogenic overexpression of the miR-17∼92 primary transcript (pri-miR-17∼92), the microprocessor complex remains associated with partially processed intermediates that aberrantly accumulate. These intermediates reflect a series of hierarchical and conserved steps in the early processing of the pri-miR-17∼92 transcript. Encumbrance of the microprocessor by miR-17∼92 intermediates leads to the broad but selective downregulation of co-expressed polycistronic miRNAs, including miRNAs derived from tumor-suppressive miR-34b/c and from the Dlk1-Dio3 polycistrons. We propose that the identified steps of polycistronic miR-17∼92 biogenesis contribute to the oncogenic re-wiring of gene regulation networks. Our results reveal previously unappreciated functional paradigms for polycistronic miRNAs in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs) represent a novel and universal class of mobile genetic elements, which have broad impact on bacterial virulence. In spite of their relevance, how the Gram-negative PICIs hijack the phage machinery for their own specific packaging and how they block phage reproduction remains to be determined. Using genetic and structural analyses, we solve the mystery here by showing that the Gram-negative PICIs encode a protein that simultaneously performs these processes. This protein, which we have named Rpp (for redirecting phage packaging), interacts with the phage terminase small subunit, forming a heterocomplex. This complex is unable to recognize the phage DNA, blocking phage packaging, but specifically binds to the PICI genome, promoting PICI packaging. Our studies reveal the mechanism of action that allows PICI dissemination in nature, introducing a new paradigm in the understanding of the biology of pathogenicity islands and therefore of bacterial pathogen evolution.

Abstract: Summary
The migration of immune cells can be guided by physical cues imposed by the environment, such as geometry, rigidity, or hydraulic resistance (HR). Neutrophils preferentially follow paths of least HR in vitro, a phenomenon known as barotaxis. The mechanisms and physiological relevance of barotaxis remain unclear. We show that barotaxis results from the amplification of a small force imbalance by the actomyosin cytoskeleton, resulting in biased directional choices. In immature dendritic cells (DCs), actomyosin is recruited to the cell front to build macropinosomes. These cells are therefore insensitive to HR, as macropinocytosis allows fluid transport across these cells. This may enhance their space exploration capacity in vivo. Conversely, mature DCs down-regulate macropinocytosis and are thus barotactic. Modeling suggests that HR may help guide these cells to lymph nodes where they initiate immune responses. Hence, DCs can either overcome or capitalize on the physical obstacles they encounter, helping their immune-surveillance function.

Abstract: Summary
Smad7, a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we found that Smad7 mediates intestinal inflammation by limiting the PDL2/1-PD1 axis in dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+T cells. Smad7 deficiency in DCs promotes TGF-β responsiveness and the co-inhibitory molecules PDL2/1 on DCs, and it further imprints T cell-PD1 signaling to promote Treg differentiation. DC-specific Smad7 deletion mitigates DSS-induced colitis by inducing CD103+PDL2/1+DCs and Tregs. In addition, Smad7 deficiency in CD4+T cells promotes PD1 and PD1-induced Tregs in vitro. The transfer of Smad7-deficient CD4+T cells enhances Tregs in vivo and protects against T cell-mediated colitis. Furthermore, Smad7 antisense ameliorates DSS-induced UC, increasing TGF-β and PDL2/1-PD1 signaling. Enhancing PD1 signaling directly via Fc-fused PDL2/1 is also beneficial. Our results identify how Smad7 mediates intestinal inflammation and leverages these pathways therapeutically, providing additional strategies for IBD intervention.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are traditionally considered non-professional phagocytes functioning predominately in oxygen transport. In the present study, we examined the ability of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), a teleost species with important economic values, RBCs to uptake inorganic particles and bacteria in different size/form, as well as the involving endocytic pathways. We found that flounder RBCs exhibited relatively high uptake/attachment capacities for 0.1 μm–1.0 μm (diameter) latex beads, but not for 2.0 μm beads. For the 0.1 μm beads, the uptake/attachment was executed through macropinocytosis and caveolae-mediated pathway, while for 0.5 μm and 1.0 μm beads, the uptake/attachment depended primarily on macropinocytosis and partially on the caveolin-mediated pathway. In addition to latex beads, flounder RBCs also exhibited an apparent capacity to engulf both live and inactivated bacteria. For live bacteria, the endocytosis was clathrin-mediated, while for inactivated bacteria, clathrin- as well as non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis were involved. Taken together, these results demonstrated that teleost RBCs possess particle uptake/attachment and bacteria phagocytosis capacities via different pathways that depend on the physical size and biological nature of the engulfed objects.

Abstract: Summary
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, affecting men more frequently and severely than women. Although recent studies suggest that differences in activity of the androgen receptor (AR) underlie the observed sex bias, little is known about AR activity in melanoma. Here we show that AR and EGR1 bind to the long non-coding RNA SLNCR and increase melanoma proliferation through coordinated transcriptional regulation of several growth-regulatory genes. ChIP-seq reveals that ligand-free AR is enriched on SLNCR-regulated melanoma genes and that AR genomic occupancy significantly overlaps with EGR1 at consensus EGR1 binding sites. We present a model in which SLNCR recruits AR to EGR1-bound genomic loci and switches EGR1-mediated transcriptional activation to repression of the tumor suppressor p21Waf1/Cip1. Our data implicate the regulatory triad of SLNCR, AR, and EGR1 in promoting oncogenesis and may help explain why men have a higher incidence of and more rapidly progressive melanomas compared with women.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular SAMHD1 inhibits replication of many viruses by limiting intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools. We investigate the influence of SAMHD1 on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). During HCMV infection, we observe SAMHD1 induction, accompanied by phosphorylation via viral kinase UL97. SAMHD1 depletion increases HCMV replication in permissive fibroblasts and conditionally permissive myeloid cells. We show this is due to enhanced gene expression from the major immediate-early (MIE) promoter and is independent of dNTP levels. SAMHD1 suppresses innate immune responses by inhibiting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. We show that SAMHD1 regulates the HCMV MIE promoter through NF-κB activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals increased RELA and RNA polymerase II on the HCMV MIE promoter in the absence of SAMHD1. Our studies reveal a mechanism of HCMV virus restriction by SAMHD1 and show how SAMHD1 deficiency activates an innate immune pathway that paradoxically results in increased viral replication through transcriptional activation of the HCMV MIE gene promoter.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons in prefrontal cortex (PF) represent mnemonic information about current goals until the action can be selected and executed. However, the neuronal dynamics underlying the transition from goal into specific actions are poorly understood. Here, we show that the goal-coding PF network is dynamically reconfigured from mnemonic to action selection states and that such reconfiguration is mediated by cell assemblies with heterogeneous excitability. We recorded neuronal activity from PF while monkeys selected their actions on the basis of memorized goals. Many PF neurons encoded the goal, but only a minority of them did so across both memory retention and action selection stages. Interestingly, about half of this minority of neurons switched their goal preference across the goal-action transition. Our computational model led us to propose a PF network composed of heterogeneous cell assemblies with single-state and bistable local dynamics able to produce both dynamical stability and input susceptibility simultaneously.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced mRNA translation delays aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. Mutations in both DAF-2 (IGF-1 receptor) and RSKS-1 (ribosomal S6 kinase/S6K) cause synergistic lifespan extension in C. elegans. To understand the roles of translational regulation in this process, we performed polysomal profiling and identified translationally regulated ribosomal and cytochrome c (CYC-2.1) genes as key mediators of longevity. cyc-2.1 knockdown significantly extends lifespan by activating the intestinal mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), mitochondrial fission, and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). The germline serves as the key tissue for cyc-2.1 to regulate lifespan, and germline-specific cyc-2.1 knockdown non-autonomously activates intestinal UPRmt and AMPK. Furthermore, the RNA-binding protein GLD-1-mediated translational repression of cyc-2.1 in the germline is important for the non-autonomous activation of UPRmt and synergistic longevity of the daf-2 rsks-1 mutant. Altogether, these results illustrate a translationally regulated non-autonomous mitochondrial stress response mechanism in the modulation of lifespan by insulin-like signaling and S6K.

Abstract: Summary
Connexin43 (Cx43; gene name GJA1) is the most ubiquitously expressed gap junction protein, and understanding of its regulation largely falls under transcription and post-translational modification. In addition to Cx43, Gja1 mRNA encodes internally translated isoforms regulating gap junction formation, whose expression is modulated by TGF-β. Here, using RLM-RACE, we identify distinct Gja1 transcripts differing only in 5′ UTR length, of which two are upregulated during TGF-β exposure and hypoxia. Introduction of these transcripts into Gja1−/− cells phenocopies the response of Gja1 to TGF-β with reduced internal translation initiation. Inhibiting pathways downstream of TGF-β selectively regulates levels of Gja1 transcript isoforms and translation products. Reporter assays reveal enhanced translation of full-length Cx43 from shorter Gja1 5′ UTR isoforms. We also observe a correlation among UTR selection, translation, and reduced gap junction formation in aged heart tissue. These data elucidate a relationship between transcript isoform expression and translation initiation regulating intercellular communication.

Abstract: Summary
Exquisite regulation of energy homeostasis protects from nutrient deprivation but causes metabolic dysfunction upon nutrient excess. In human and murine adipose tissue, the accumulation of ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) accompanies obesity, implicating this receptor in energy metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that mice bearing global- or adipocyte-specific deletion of Ager, the gene encoding RAGE, display superior metabolic recovery after fasting, a cold challenge, or high-fat feeding. The RAGE-dependent mechanisms were traced to suppression of protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of its key targets, hormone-sensitive lipase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, upon β-adrenergic receptor stimulation—processes that dampen the expression and activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and thermogenic programs. This work identifies the innate role of RAGE as a key node in the immunometabolic networks that control responses to nutrient supply and cold challenges, and it unveils opportunities to harness energy expenditure in environmental and metabolic stress.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the epigenomic foundation of naive pluripotency, we implement a quantitative multiplexed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) method comparing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) grown in 2i versus 2i/serum and serum conditions. MINUTE-ChIP has a large linear dynamic range for accurately quantifying relative differences in genome-wide histone modification patterns across multiple pooled samples. We find compelling evidence for a broad H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) hypermethylation of the genome, while bivalent promoters stably retain high H3K27me3 levels in 2i. We show that DNA hypomethylation, as observed in 2i, is a contributor to genome-wide gain of H3K27me3, while active demethylation by JMJD3/UTX counteracts further accumulation of H3K27me3. In parallel, we find hypomethylation of H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), particularly at bivalent promoters, to be a characteristic of the 2i ground state. Serum stimulates H3K4me3 independent of GSK-3b and ERK signaling, suggesting that low H3K4me3 and high H3K27me3 levels at bivalent promoters are a product of two independent mechanisms that safeguard naive pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear glycogen was first documented in the early 1940s, but its role in cellular physiology remained elusive. In this study, we utilized pure nuclei preparations and stable isotope tracers to define the origin and metabolic fate of nuclear glycogen. Herein, we describe a key function for nuclear glycogen in epigenetic regulation through compartmentalized pyruvate production and histone acetylation. This pathway is altered in human non-small cell lung cancers, as surgical specimens accumulate glycogen in the nucleus. We demonstrate that the decreased abundance of malin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, impaired nuclear glycogenolysis by preventing the nuclear translocation of glycogen phosphorylase and causing nuclear glycogen accumulation. Re-introduction of malin in lung cancer cells restored nuclear glycogenolysis, increased histone acetylation, and decreased growth of cancer cells transplanted into mice. This study uncovers a previously unknown role for glycogen metabolism in the nucleus and elucidates another mechanism by which cellular metabolites control epigenetic regulation.

Abstract: Brain cytoplasmic 200 RNA (BC200 RNA), originally identified as a neuron-specific non-coding RNA, is also observed in various cancer cells that originate from non-neural cells. Studies have revealed diverse functions of BC200 RNA in cancer cells. Accordingly, we hypothesized that BC200 RNA might be modified in cancer cells to generate cancerous BC200 RNA responsible for its cancer-specific functions. Here, we report that BC200 RNA sequences are highly heterogeneous in cancer cells by virtue of multiple adenine nucleotide insertions in the internal A-rich region. The insertion of adenine nucleotides enhances BC200 RNA-mediated translation inhibition, possibly by increasing the binding affinity of BC200 RNA for eIF4A (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A).

Abstract: Summary
Small-cell neuroendocrine cancers (SCNCs) are an aggressive cancer subtype. Transdifferentiation toward an SCN phenotype has been reported as a resistance route in response to targeted therapies. Here, we identified a convergence to an SCN state that is widespread across epithelial cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. More broadly, non-SCN metastases have higher expression of SCN-associated transcription factors than non-SCN primary tumors. Drug sensitivity and gene dependency screens demonstrate that these convergent SCNCs have shared vulnerabilities. These common vulnerabilities are found across unannotated SCN-like epithelial cases, small-round-blue cell tumors, and unexpectedly in hematological malignancies. The SCN convergent phenotype and common sensitivity profiles with hematological cancers can guide treatment options beyond tissue-specific targeted therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Epitope-targeted HIV vaccine design seeks to focus antibody responses to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) sites by sequential immunization. A chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) shares a single bnAb site, the variable loop 2 (V2)-apex, with HIV, suggesting its possible utility in an HIV immunization strategy. Here, we generate a chimpanzee SIV Env trimer, MT145K, which displays selective binding to HIV V2-apex bnAbs and precursor versions, but no binding to other HIV specificities. We determine the structure of the MT145K trimer by cryo-EM and show that its architecture is remarkably similar to HIV Env. Immunization of an HIV V2-apex bnAb precursor Ab-expressing knockin mouse with the chimpanzee MT145K trimer induces HIV V2-specific neutralizing responses. Subsequent boosting with an HIV trimer cocktail induces responses that exhibit some virus cross-neutralization. Overall, the chimpanzee MT145K trimer behaves as expected from design both in vitro and in vivo and is an attractive potential component of a sequential immunization regimen to induce V2-apex bnAbs.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, maintain homeostasis and sense pathological changes by continuously surveying the parenchyma with highly motile large processes. Here, we demonstrate that microglia also use thin actin-dependent filopodia that allow fast nanoscale sensing within discrete regions. Filopodia are distinct from large processes by their size, speed, and regulation mechanism. Increasing cyclic AMP (cAMP) by activating norepinephrine Gs-coupled receptors, applying nitric oxide, or inhibiting phosphodiesterases rapidly increases filopodia but collapses large processes. Alternatively, Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor activation collapses filopodia but triggers large processes extension with bulbous tips. Similar control of cytoskeletal dynamics and microglial morphology by cAMP is observed in ramified primary microglia, suggesting that filopodia are intrinsically generated sensing structures. Therefore, nanoscale surveillance of brain parenchyma by microglia requires localized cAMP increases that drive filopodia formation. Shifting intracellular cAMP levels controls the polarity of microglial responses to changes in brain homeostasis and alters the scale of immunosurveillance.

Abstract: Summary
Phagocytosis, the engulfment of particulate matter, requires the coordinated polymerization of F-actin; however, the nature and dynamics of the F-actin structures generated during the process are incompletely defined. Using super-resolution microscopy, we observed the formation of podosome-like structures during Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Unlike conventional podosomes, these structures are short lived and vectorial, expanding radially from the sites where phagocytic targets are initially engaged. The expanding ring of podosome-like structures requires the localized formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Concomitantly, the initial podosome-like structures disappear from the center of the phagocytic cup, enabling membrane bending around the target. This coordinated disappearance is mediated by localized hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the center of the cup. Interference reflection microscopy revealed that the podosome-like structures attach tightly to the target, facilitating the progressive engagement and activation of phagocytic receptors, creating a diffusion barrier and serving as support for the extension of exploratory lamellipodia that probe the target surface.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are phenotypically heterogeneous and exert either anti- or pro-metastatic functions. We show that cancer-cell-derived G-CSF is necessary, but not sufficient, to mobilize immature low-density neutrophils (iLDNs) that promote liver metastasis. In contrast, mature high-density neutrophils inhibit the formation of liver metastases. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of high- and low-density neutrophils reveal engagement of numerous metabolic pathways specifically in low-density neutrophils. iLDNs exhibit enhanced global bioenergetic capacity, through their ability to engage mitochondrial-dependent ATP production, and remain capable of executing pro-metastatic neutrophil functions, including NETosis, under nutrient-deprived conditions. We demonstrate that NETosis is an important neutrophil function that promotes breast cancer liver metastasis. iLDNs rely on the catabolism of glutamate and proline to support mitochondrial-dependent metabolism in the absence of glucose, which enables sustained NETosis. These data reveal that distinct pro-metastatic neutrophil populations exhibit a high degree of metabolic flexibility, which facilitates the formation of liver metastases.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptor protein 2 (AP2) is a major constituent of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). Whether it is essential for all forms of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in mammalian cells is an open issue. Here, we demonstrate, by live TIRF microscopy, the existence of a subclass of relatively short-lived CCPs lacking AP2 under physiological, unperturbed conditions. This subclass is retained in AP2-knockout cells and is able to support the internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) but not of transferrin receptor (TfR). The AP2-independent internalization mechanism relies on the endocytic adaptors eps15, eps15L1, and epsin1. The absence of AP2 impairs the recycling of the EGFR to the cell surface, thereby augmenting its degradation. Accordingly, under conditions of AP2 ablation, we detected dampening of EGFR-dependent AKT signaling and cell migration, arguing that distinct classes of CCPs could provide specialized functions in regulating EGFR recycling and signaling.

Abstract: Summary
H2AX safeguards genomic stability in a dose-dependent manner; however, mechanisms governing its proteostasis are poorly understood. Here, we identify a PRMT5-RNF168-SMURF2 cascade that regulates H2AX proteostasis. We show that PRMT5 sustains the expression of RNF168, an E3 ubiquitin ligase essential for DNA damage response (DDR). Suppression of PRMT5 occurs in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficient glioblastoma cells and attenuates the expression of RNF168, leading to destabilization of H2AX by E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2. RNF168 and SMURF2 serve as a stabilizer and destabilizer of H2AX, respectively, via their dynamic interactions with H2AX. In supporting an important role of this signaling cascade in regulating H2AX, MTAP-deficient glioblastoma cells display higher levels of DNA damage spontaneously or in response to genotoxic agents. These findings reveal a regulatory mechanism of H2AX proteostasis and define a signaling cascade that is essential to DDR and that is disrupted by the loss of a metabolic enzyme in tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic pain presents a major unmet clinical problem. The development of more effective treatments is hindered by our limited understanding of the neuronal circuits underlying sensory perception. Here, we show that parvalbumin (PV)-expressing dorsal horn interneurons modulate the passage of sensory information conveyed by low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) directly via presynaptic inhibition and also gate the polysynaptic relay of LTMR input to pain circuits by inhibiting lamina II excitatory interneurons whose axons project into lamina I. We show changes in the functional properties of these PV interneurons following peripheral nerve injury and that silencing these cells unmasks a circuit that allows innocuous touch inputs to activate pain circuits by increasing network activity in laminae I–IV. Such changes are likely to result in the development of tactile allodynia and could be targeted for more effective treatment of mechanical pain.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic silencing defends against LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition in mammalian cells. However, the mechanisms that repress young L1 families and how L1 escapes to cause somatic genome mosaicism in the brain remain unclear. Here we report that a conserved Yin Yang 1 (YY1) transcription factor binding site mediates L1 promoter DNA methylation in pluripotent and differentiated cells. By analyzing 24 hippocampal neurons with three distinct single-cell genomic approaches, we characterized and validated a somatic L1 insertion bearing a 3ʹ transduction. The source (donor) L1 for this insertion was slightly 5ʹ truncated, lacked the YY1 binding site, and was highly mobile when tested in vitro. Locus-specific bisulfite sequencing revealed that the donor L1 and other young L1s with mutated YY1 binding sites were hypomethylated in embryonic stem cells, during neurodifferentiation, and in liver and brain tissue. These results explain how L1 can evade repression and retrotranspose in the human body.

Abstract: Neural stem cells (NSCs) generated neurons and glial cells. Thus, it is a preferable candidate to the cell replacement-based therapy against neural disorders. The signaling pathways that regulate differentiation of NSCs are widely studied. In the current study, we used in vitro culture system to elucidate the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in NSCs’ differentiation. Downregulation of STAT1 inhibited the proliferation of NSCs. Meanwhile, we also found STAT1 regulation could control the differentiation of NSCs. More neurons and glia cells were generated from NSCs with STAT1 silencing. This process was mediated by the JNK/STAT1 signaling. STAT1 inhibitor promoted differentiation of NSCs. After transplantation, we observed more neurons generated from NSCs with shRNA-STAT1 treatment. Collectively, this work showed an efficient way to regulate neuronal differentiation of NSCs through regulating the STAT1 expression. This is likely to provide source and theoretical support to cell replacement based theory.

Abstract: Summary
Anabolic resistance and impaired myocellular quality contribute to age-related sarcopenia, which exacerbates with obesity. Diet-induced muscle mass loss is attenuated by resistance or aerobic plus resistance exercise compared to aerobic exercise in obese elderly. We assessed chronic effects of weight loss plus different exercise modalities on muscle protein synthesis response to feeding and myocellular quality. Obese older adults were randomized to a weight-management program plus aerobic, resistance, or combined aerobic and resistance exercise or to control. Participants underwent vastus lateralis biopsies at baseline and 6 months. Muscle protein synthesis rate increased more in resistance and combined than in control. Autophagy mediators’ expression decreased more in combined than in aerobic, which experienced a higher increase in inflammation and mitochondrial regulators’ expression. In obese elderly, combined aerobic and resistance exercise is superior to either mode independently for improving muscle protein synthesis and myocellular quality, thereby maintaining muscle mass during weight-loss therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome (ML-DS) clonally evolves from transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), a preleukemic condition in DS newborns. To define mechanisms of leukemic transformation, we combined exome and targeted resequencing of 111 TAM and 141 ML-DS samples with functional analyses. TAM requires trisomy 21 and truncating mutations in GATA1; additional TAM variants are usually not pathogenic. By contrast, in ML-DS, clonal and subclonal variants are functionally required. We identified a recurrent and oncogenic hotspot gain-of-function mutation in myeloid cytokine receptor CSF2RB. By a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 screen in an in vivo murine TAM model, we tested loss-of-function of 22 recurrently mutated ML-DS genes. Loss of 18 different genes produced leukemias that phenotypically, genetically, and transcriptionally mirrored ML-DS.

Abstract: Summary
The immune system adapts to constitutive antigens to preserve self-tolerance, which is a major barrier for anti-tumor immunity. Antigen-specific reversal of tolerance constitutes a major goal to spur therapeutic applications. Here, we show that robust, iterative, systemic stimulation targeting tissue-specific antigens in the context of acute infections reverses established CD8+ T cell tolerance to self, including in T cells that survive negative selection. This strategy results in large numbers of circulating and resident memory self-specific CD8+ T cells that are widely distributed and can be co-opted to control established malignancies bearing self-antigen without concomitant autoimmunity. Targeted expansion of both self- and tumor neoantigen-specific T cells acts synergistically to boost anti-tumor immunity and elicits protection against aggressive melanoma. Our findings demonstrate that T cell tolerance can be re-adapted to responsiveness through robust antigenic exposure, generating self-specific CD8+ T cells that can be used for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The computational identification of peptides that can bind the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with high affinity is an essential step in developing personal immunotherapies and vaccines. We introduce PUFFIN, a deep residual network-based computational approach that quantifies uncertainty in peptide-MHC affinity prediction that arises from observational noise and the lack of relevant training examples. With PUFFIN's uncertainty metrics, we define binding likelihood, the probability a peptide binds to a given MHC allele at a specified affinity threshold. Compared to affinity point estimates, we find that binding likelihood correlates better with the observed affinity and reduces false positives in high-affinity peptide design. When applied to examine an existing peptide vaccine, PUFFIN identifies an alternative vaccine formulation with higher binding likelihood.

Abstract: Summary
During energy bursts, neutral lipids fabricated within the ER bilayer demix to form lipid droplets (LDs). LDs bud off mainly in the cytosol where they regulate metabolism and multiple biological processes. They indeed become accessible to most enzymes and can interact with other organelles. How such directional emergence is achieved remains elusive. Here, we found that this directionality is controlled by an asymmetry in monolayer surface coverage. Model LDs emerge on the membrane leaflet of higher coverage, which is improved by the insertion of proteins and phospholipids. In cells, continuous LD emergence on the cytosol would require a constant refill of phospholipids to the ER cytosolic leaflet. Consistent with this model, cells deficient in phospholipids present an increased number of LDs exposed to the ER lumen and compensate by remodeling ER shape. Our results reveal an active cooperation between phospholipids and proteins to extract LDs from ER.

Abstract: Summary
The microtubule-based spindle is subjected to various mechanical forces during cell division. How the structure generates and responds to forces while maintaining overall integrity is unknown because we have a poor understanding of the relationship between filament architecture and mechanics. Here, to fill this gap, we combine microneedle-based quantitative micromanipulation with high-resolution imaging, simultaneously analyzing forces and local filament motility in the Xenopus meiotic spindle. We find that microtubules exhibit a compliant, fluid-like mechanical response at the middle of the spindle half, being distinct from those near the pole and the equator. A force altering spindle length induces filament sliding at this compliant array, where parallel microtubules predominate, without influencing equatorial antiparallel filament dynamics. Molecular perturbations suggest that kinesin-5 and dynein contribute to the spindle’s local mechanical difference. Together, our data establish a link between spindle architecture and mechanics and uncover the mechanical design of this essential cytoskeletal assembly.

Abstract: We set out to develop scalable assays to measure bacterial adhesion to mammalian extracellular matrix proteins, with the aim to perform high-throughput screening for inhibitors. Our model system is the trimeric autotransporter adhesin YadA from Yersinia enterocolitica that binds to collagen. Using bacterial cells expressing GFP under an inducible promotor, and co-expressing the adhesin of choice, we were able to establish a 384-well plate-based assay that allowed us to screen 28,000 compounds in 8 days (3520 compounds per day). We have collected all parameters that were essential in assay development, and describe how they can be tuned for improved performance. Out of 28,000 compounds, 5 compounds showed significant inhibitory activity, measured as loss of fluorescence compared to control wells. Our assay is easy to scale up, and can be adopted to different ECM component/Adhesin combinations. Alternatively, bacterial pathogens (harboring deletion mutants of adhesins compared to wildtype) could be used directly in the same assay if they express GFP as a reporter at high levels.

Abstract: Summary
Whether cell forces or extracellular matrix (ECM) can impact genome integrity is largely unclear. Here, acute perturbations (∼1 h) to actomyosin stress or ECM elasticity cause rapid and reversible changes in lamin-A, DNA damage, and cell cycle. The findings are especially relevant to organs such as the heart because DNA damage permanently arrests cardiomyocyte proliferation shortly after birth and thereby eliminates regeneration after injury including heart attack. Embryonic hearts, cardiac-differentiated iPS cells (induced pluripotent stem cells), and various nonmuscle cell types all show that actomyosin-driven nuclear rupture causes cytoplasmic mis-localization of DNA repair factors and excess DNA damage. Binucleation and micronuclei increase as telomeres shorten, which all favor cell-cycle arrest. Deficiencies in lamin-A and repair factors exacerbate these effects, but lamin-A-associated defects are rescued by repair factor overexpression and also by contractility modulators in clinical trials. Contractile cells on stiff ECM normally exhibit low phosphorylation and slow degradation of lamin-A by matrix-metalloprotease-2 (MMP2), and inhibition of this lamin-A turnover and also actomyosin contractility are seen to minimize DNA damage. Lamin-A is thus stress stabilized to mechano-protect the genome.

Abstract: Summary
mRNAs are regulated by nucleotide modifications that influence their cellular fate. Two of the most abundant modified nucleotides are N6-methyladenosine (m6A), found within mRNAs, and N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), which is found at the first transcribed nucleotide. Distinguishing these modifications in mapping studies has been difficult. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize PCIF1, the methyltransferase that generates m6Am. We find that PCIF1 binds and is dependent on the m7G cap. By depleting PCIF1, we generated transcriptome-wide maps that distinguish m6Am and m6A. We find that m6A and m6Am misannotations arise from mRNA isoforms with alternative transcription start sites (TSSs). These isoforms contain m6Am that maps to “internal” sites, increasing the likelihood of misannotation. We find that depleting PCIF1 does not substantially affect mRNA translation but is associated with reduced stability of a subset of m6Am-annotated mRNAs. The discovery of PCIF1 and our accurate mapping technique will facilitate future studies to characterize m6Am’s function.

Abstract: Summary
The function of regulatory T (Treg) cells depends on lipid oxidation. However, the molecular mechanism by which Treg cells maintain lipid metabolism after activation remains elusive. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) acts as a coordinator by linking cellular metabolism to substrate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We show that deletion of LKB1 in Treg cells exhibited reduced suppressive activity and developed fatal autoimmune inflammation. Mechanistically, LKB1 induced activation of the mevalonate pathway by upregulating mevalonate genes, which was essential for Treg cell functional competency and stability by inducing Treg cell proliferation and suppressing interferon-gamma and interleukin-17A expression independently of AMPK. Furthermore, LKB1 was found to regulate intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and to promote the mevalonate pathway. In agreement, mevalonate and its metabolite geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate inhibited conversion of Treg cells and enhanced survival of LKB1-deficient Treg mice. Thus, LKB1 is a key regulator of lipid metabolism in Treg cells, involved in optimal programming of suppressive activity, immune homeostasis, and tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle mass, strength, and regenerative capacity decline with age, with many measures showing a greater deterioration in females around the time estrogen levels decrease at menopause. Here, we show that estrogen deficiency severely compromises the maintenance of muscle stem cells (i.e., satellite cells) as well as impairs self-renewal and differentiation into muscle fibers. Mechanistically, by hormone replacement, use of a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (bazedoxifene), and conditional estrogen receptor knockout, we implicate 17β-estradiol and satellite cell expression of estrogen receptor α and show that estrogen signaling through this receptor is necessary to prevent apoptosis of satellite cells. Early data from a biopsy study of women who transitioned from peri- to post-menopause are consistent with the loss of satellite cells coincident with the decline in estradiol in humans. Together, these results demonstrate an important role for estrogen in satellite cell maintenance and muscle regeneration in females.

Abstract: Summary
The melanization response is an important defense mechanism in arthropods. This reaction is mediated by phenoloxidases (POs), which are activated by complex extracellular serine protease (SP) cascades. Here, we investigate the role of SPs in the melanization response using compound mutants in D. melanogaster and discover phenotypes previously concealed in single-mutant analyses. We find that two SPs, Hayan and Sp7, activate the melanization response in different manners: Hayan is required for blackening wound sites, whereas Sp7 regulates an alternate melanization reaction responsible for the clearance of Staphylococcus aureus. We present evidence that Sp7 is regulated by SPs activating the Toll NF-κB pathway, namely ModSP and Grass. Additionally, we reveal a role for the combined action of Hayan and Psh in propagating Toll signaling downstream of pattern recognition receptors activating either Toll signaling or the melanization response.

Abstract: Summary
The Keap1-Nrf2 system plays a central role in the oxidative stress response; however, the identity of the reactive oxygen species sensor within Keap1 remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a Keap1 mutant lacking 11 cysteine residues retains the ability to target Nrf2 for degradation, but it is unable to respond to cysteine-reactive Nrf2 inducers. Of the 11 mutated cysteine residues, we find that 4 (Cys226/613/622/624) are important for sensing hydrogen peroxide. Our analyses of multiple mutant mice lines, complemented by MEFs expressing a series of Keap1 mutants, reveal that Keap1 uses the cysteine residues redundantly to set up an elaborate fail-safe mechanism in which specific combinations of these four cysteine residues can form a disulfide bond to sense hydrogen peroxide. This sensing mechanism is distinct from that used for electrophilic Nrf2 inducers, demonstrating that Keap1 is equipped with multiple cysteine-based sensors to detect various endogenous and exogenous stresses.

Abstract: Summary
The brain is a major site of relapse for several cancers, yet deciphering the mechanisms of brain metastasis remains a challenge because of the complexity of the brain tumor microenvironment (TME). To define the molecular landscape of brain metastasis from intact tissue in vivo, we employ an RNA-sequencing-based approach, which leverages the transcriptome of xenografts and distinguishes tumor cell and stromal gene expression with improved sensitivity and accuracy. Our data reveal shifts in epithelial and neuronal-like lineage programs in malignant cells as they adapt to the brain TME and the reciprocal neuroinflammatory response of the stroma. We identify several transcriptional hallmarks of metastasis that are specific to particular regions of the brain, induced across multiple tumor types, and confirmed in syngeneic models and patient biopsies. These data may serve as a resource for exploring mechanisms of TME co-adaptation within, as well as across, different subtypes of brain metastasis.

Abstract: TSPAN12, a member of the tetraspanin family, has been highly connected with the pathogenesis of cancer. Its biological function, however, especially in ovarian cancer (OC), has not been well elucidated. In this study, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset analysis revealed that upregulation of TSPAN12 gene expression was significantly correlated with patient survival, suggesting that TSPAN12 might be a potential prognostic marker for OC. Further exploration showed that TSPAN12 overexpression accelerated proliferation and colony formation of OVCAR3 and SKOV3 OC cells. Knockdown of TSPAN12 expression in A2780 and SKOV3 cells decreased both proliferation and colony formation. Western blot analysis showed that several cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) (e.g., Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E2, CDK2, and CDK4) were significantly involved in the regulation of cell cycle downstream of TSPAN12. Moreover, TSPAN12 accelerated mitotic progression by controlling cell cycle. Thus, our data demonstrated that TSPAN12 could be a novel molecular target for the treatment of OC.

Abstract: Summary
Necroptosis, a cell death pathway mediated by the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signaling cascade downstream of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), has been implicated in many inflammatory diseases. Members of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases are known for their anti-apoptotic, oncogenic, and anti-inflammatory roles. Here, we identify an unexpected role of TAM kinases as promoters of necroptosis, a pro-inflammatory necrotic cell death. Pharmacologic or genetic targeting of TAM kinases results in a potent inhibition of necroptotic death in various cellular models. We identify phosphorylation of MLKL Tyr376 as a direct point of input from TAM kinases into the necroptosis signaling. The oligomerization of MLKL, but not its membranal translocation or phosphorylation by RIPK3, is controlled by TAM kinases. Importantly, both knockout and inhibition of TAM kinases protect mice from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In conclusion, this study discovers that immunosuppressant TAM kinases are promoters of pro-inflammatory necroptosis, shedding light on the biological complexity of the regulation of inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Cold stress adversely affects plant growth, development, and crop productivity and quality. Plants employ cold acclimation strategy to protect them from cold damage. The transcription-factor-CBF-dependent cold signaling pathway plays a key role in plant cold acclimation. However, how this signaling pathway is dynamically and precisely regulated remains unknown. Here, we report that two U-box type E3 ubiquitin ligases, PUB25 and PUB26, positively regulate freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Both PUB25 and PUB26 poly-ubiquitinate MYB15, a transcriptional repressor of the CBF-dependent cold signaling pathway, leading to MYB15 degradation and thus enhanced CBF expression under cold stress. Furthermore, cold-activated OST1 specifically phosphorylates PUB25 and PUB26 at conserved threonine residues, enhancing their E3 activity and facilitating the cold-induced degradation of MYB15. Our results thus unravel the regulatory role of the OST1-PUB25/26 module in regulating the duration and amplitude of the cold response by controlling the homeostasis of the negative regulator MYB15.

Abstract: Summary
Gliomas are primary, diffusely infiltrating brain tumors. Microglia are innate immune cells in the CNS and make up a substantial portion of the tumor mass. Glioma cells shape their microenvironment, communicating with and reprogramming surrounding cells, resulting in enhanced angiogenesis, immune suppression, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Glioma cells communicate with microglia, in part by releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs). Mouse glioma cells stably expressing a palmitoylated GFP to label EVs were implanted intracranially into syngeneic miR-21-null mice. Here, we demonstrate functional delivery of miR-21, regulating specific downstream mRNA targets in microglia after uptake of tumor-derived EVs. These findings attest to EV-dependent microRNA delivery as studied in an in vivo-based model and provide insight into the reprograming of microglial cells by tumor cells to create a favorable microenvironment for cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage activates checkpoints that limit the replicative potential of stem cells, including differentiation. These checkpoints protect against cancer development but also promote tissue aging. Because mice lacking Slug/Snai2 exhibit limited stem cell activity, including luminobasal differentiation, and are protected from mammary cancer, we reasoned that Slug might regulate DNA damage checkpoints in mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that Slug facilitates efficient execution of RPA32-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. Slug deficiency leads to delayed phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and its effectors RPA32 and CHK1. This leads to impaired RAD51 recruitment to DNA damage sites and persistence of unresolved DNA damage. In vivo, Slug/Snai2 loss leads to increased DNA damage and premature aging of mammary epithelium. Collectively, our work demonstrates that the mammary stem cell regulator Slug controls DDR checkpoints by dually inhibiting differentiation and facilitating DDR repair, and its loss causes unresolved DNA damage and accelerated aging.

Abstract: Summary
Inappropriate activation of the p53 transcription factor contributes to numerous developmental syndromes characterized by distinct constellations of phenotypes. How p53 drives exquisitely specific sets of symptoms in diverse syndromes, however, remains enigmatic. Here, we deconvolute the basis of p53-driven developmental syndromes by leveraging an array of mouse strains to modulate the spatial expression pattern, temporal profile, and magnitude of p53 activation during embryogenesis. We demonstrate that inappropriate p53 activation in the neural crest, facial ectoderm, anterior heart field, and endothelium induces distinct spectra of phenotypes. Moreover, altering the timing and degree of p53 hyperactivation substantially affects the phenotypic outcomes. Phenotypes are associated with p53-driven cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending on the cell type, with gene expression programs, rather than extent of mitochondrial priming, largely governing the specific response. Together, our findings provide a critical framework for decoding the role of p53 as a mediator of diverse developmental syndromes.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is a pleiotropic mediator of inflammation and is produced in response to a wide range of stimuli. During infection, IL-1β production occurs in parallel with the onset of innate antimicrobial defenses, but the contribution of IL-1β signaling to cell-intrinsic immunity is not defined. Here, we report that exogenous IL-1β induces interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation in human myeloid, fibroblast, and epithelial cells. IRF3 activation by IL-1β is dependent upon the DNA-sensing pathway adaptor, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), through the recognition of cytosolic mtDNA by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS). IL-1β treatment results in interferon (IFN) production and activation of IFN signaling to direct a potent innate immune response that restricts dengue virus infection. This study identifies a new function for IL-1β in the onset or enhancement of cell-intrinsic immunity, with important implications for cGAS-STING in integrating inflammatory and microbial cues for host defense.

Abstract: Summary
rRNAs and tRNAs universally require processing from longer primary transcripts to become functional for translation. Here, we describe an unsuspected link between tRNA maturation and the 3′ processing of 16S rRNA, a key step in preparing the small ribosomal subunit for interaction with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotic translation initiation. We show that an accumulation of either 5′ or 3′ immature tRNAs triggers RelA-dependent production of the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. The accumulation of (p)ppGpp and accompanying decrease in GTP levels specifically inhibit 16S rRNA 3′ maturation. We suggest that cells can exploit this mechanism to sense potential slowdowns in tRNA maturation and adjust rRNA processing accordingly to maintain the appropriate functional balance between these two major components of the translation apparatus.

Abstract: Summary
Cells respond to nutrient stress by trafficking cytosolic contents to lysosomes for degradation via macroautophagy. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as an initiation site for autophagosomes and is also remodeled in response to nutrient stress through ER-phagy, a form of selective autophagy. Quantitative proteome analysis during nutrient stress identified an unstudied single-pass transmembrane ER protein, TEX264, as an ER-phagy receptor. TEX264 uses an LC3-interacting region (LIR) to traffic into ATG8-positive puncta that often initiate from three-way ER tubule junctions and subsequently fuse with lysosomes. Interaction and proximity biotinylation proteomics identified a cohort of autophagy regulatory proteins and cargo adaptors located near TEX264 in an LIR-dependent manner. Global proteomics and ER-phagy flux analysis revealed the stabilization of a cohort of ER proteins in TEX264−/− cells during nutrient stress. This work reveals TEX264 as an unrecognized ER-phagy receptor that acts independently of other candidate ER-phagy receptors to remodel the ER during nutrient stress.

Abstract: Summary
In the negative feedback loop driving fungal and animal circadian oscillators, negative elements (FREQUENCY [FRQ], PERIODS [PERs], and CRYPTOCHROMES [CRYs]) are understood to inhibit their own expression, in part by promoting the phosphorylation of their heterodimeric transcriptional activators (e.g., White Collar-1 [WC-1]-WC-2 [White Collar complex; WCC] and BMAL1/Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput [CLOCK]). However, correlations between heterodimer activity and phosphorylation are weak, contradictions exist, and mechanistic details are almost wholly lacking. We report mapping of 80 phosphosites on WC-1 and 15 on WC-2 and elucidation of the time-of-day-specific code, requiring both a group of phosphoevents on WC-1 and two distinct clusters on WC-2, that governs circadian repression, leading to feedback loop closure. Combinatorial control via phosphorylation also governs rhythmic WCC binding to the promoters of clock-controlled genes mediating the essential first step in circadian output, a group encoding both transcription factors and signaling proteins. These data provide a basic mechanistic understanding for fundamental events underlying circadian negative feedback and output, key aspects of circadian biology.

Abstract: Summary
Protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is critical for neuronal function. Neurons utilize microtubule-dependent molecular motors to allocate proteasomes to synapses, but how proteasomes are coupled to motors and how this is regulated to meet changing demand for protein breakdown remain largely unknown. We show that the conserved proteasome-binding protein PI31 serves as an adaptor to couple proteasomes with dynein light chain proteins (DYNLL1/2). The inactivation of PI31 inhibited proteasome motility in axons and disrupted synaptic proteostasis, structure, and function. Moreover, phosphorylation of PI31 by p38 MAPK enhanced binding to DYNLL1/2 and promoted the directional movement of proteasomes in axons, suggesting a mechanism to regulate loading of proteasomes onto motors. Inactivation of PI31 in mouse neurons attenuated proteasome movement in axons, indicating this process is conserved. Because mutations affecting PI31 activity are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, impairment of PI31-mediated axonal transport of proteasomes may contribute to these disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) maintains a delicate balance between mediating viral entry and escaping antibody neutralization. Adaptation during transmission of neutralization-sensitive Envs with an “open” conformation remains poorly understood. By passaging a replication-competent simian-human immunodeficiency virus carrying a highly neutralization-sensitive Env (SHIVCNE40) in rhesus macaques, we show that SHIVCNE40 develops enhanced replication kinetics associated with neutralization resistance against antibodies and autologous serum. A gp41 substitution, E658K, functions as the major determinant for these properties. Structural modeling and functional verification indicate that the substitution disrupts an intermolecular salt bridge with the neighboring protomer, thereby promoting fusion and facilitating immune evasion. This effect is applicable across diverse HIV-1 subtypes. Our results highlight the critical role of gp41 in shaping the neutralization profile and the overall conformation of Env during viral adaptation. The unique intermolecular salt bridge could potentially be utilized for rational vaccine design involving more stable HIV-1 envelope trimers.

Abstract: Summary
To elicit apoptosis, BAX metamorphoses from an inert cytosolic monomer into homo-oligomers that permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). A long-standing puzzle is that BH3 domains apparently activate BAX by not only its canonical groove but also a proposed site involving helices α1 and α6. Our mutagenesis studies reveal that late steps like oligomerization require activation through the groove but probably not earlier steps like MOM association. Conversely, α1 or α6 obstruction and alanine mutagenesis scanning implicate these helices early in BAX activation. The α1 and α6 mutations lowered BH3 binding, altered the BAX conformation, and reduced its MOM translocation and integration; their exposure of the BAX α1-α2 loop allosterically sequestered its α9 membrane anchor in the groove. The crystal structure of an α6 mutant revealed additional allosteric effects. The results suggest that the α1 and α6 region drives MOM association and integration, whereas groove binding favors subsequent steps toward oligomerization.

Abstract: Summary
Adenine N6 methylation in DNA (6mA) is widespread among bacteria and phage and is detected in mammalian genomes, where its function is largely unexplored. Here we show that 6mA deposition and removal are catalyzed by the Mettl4 methyltransferase and Alkbh4 dioxygenase, respectively, and that 6mA accumulation in genic elements corresponds with transcriptional silencing. Inactivation of murine Mettl4 depletes 6mA and causes sublethality and craniofacial dysmorphism in incross progeny. We identify distinct 6mA sensor domains of prokaryotic origin within the MPND deubiquitinase and ASXL1, a component of the Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, both of which act to remove monoubiquitin from histone H2A (H2A-K119Ub), a repressive mark. Deposition of 6mA by Mettl4 triggers the proteolytic destruction of both sensor proteins, preserving genome-wide H2A-K119Ub levels. Expression of the bacterial 6mA methyltransferase Dam, in contrast, fails to destroy either sensor. These findings uncover a native, adversarial 6mA network architecture that preserves Polycomb silencing.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of arbovirus transmission and pathogenesis is essential to develop strategies for treatment and prevention. We previously took an in vivo evolution-based approach and identified the chikungunya virus E1 glycoprotein residue 80 to play a critical role in viral transmission and pathogenesis. In this study, we address the genetic conservation and function of position 80 and demonstrate that this residue is a key determinant in alphavirus infectivity and dissemination through modulation of viral fusion and cholesterol dependence. In addition, in studying the evolution of position 80, we identified a network of glycoprotein residues, including epidemic determinants, that regulate virus dissemination and infectivity. These studies underscore the importance of taking evolution-based approaches to not only identify key viral determinants driving arbovirus transmission and pathogenesis but also to uncover fundamental aspects of arbovirus biology.

Abstract: Summary
RAC1 P29 is the third most commonly mutated codon in human cutaneous melanoma, after BRAF V600 and NRAS Q61. Here, we study the role of RAC1P29S in melanoma development and reveal that RAC1P29S activates PAK, AKT, and a gene expression program initiated by the SRF/MRTF transcriptional pathway, which results in a melanocytic to mesenchymal phenotypic switch. Mice with ubiquitous expression of RAC1P29S from the endogenous locus develop lymphoma. When expressed only in melanocytes, RAC1P29S cooperates with oncogenic BRAF or with NF1-loss to promote tumorigenesis. RAC1P29S also drives resistance to BRAF inhibitors, which is reversed by SRF/MRTF inhibitors. These findings establish RAC1P29S as a promoter of melanoma initiation and mediator of therapy resistance, while identifying SRF/MRTF as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated axonal trafficking of mitochondria is linked to neurodegenerative disorders. We report a high-content screen for small-molecule regulators of the axonal transport of mitochondria. Six compounds enhanced mitochondrial transport in the sub-micromolar range, acting via three cellular targets: F-actin, Tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), or Aurora Kinase B (AurKB). Pharmacological inhibition or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of each target promotes mitochondrial axonal transport in rat hippocampal neurons and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human cortical neurons and enhances mitochondrial transport in iPSC-derived motor neurons from an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient bearing one copy of SOD1A4V mutation. Our work identifies druggable regulators of axonal transport of mitochondria, provides broadly applicable methods for similar image-based screens, and suggests that restoration of proper axonal trafficking of mitochondria can be achieved in human ALS neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations accumulating in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) during development can cause severe hematological disorders. Modeling these mutations in mice is essential for understanding their functional consequences. Here, we describe an efficient CRISPR/Cas9-based system to knock in and repair genes in mouse HSPCs. CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins, in combination with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-DJ donor templates, led to gene knockin efficiencies of up to 30% in the Lmnb1 and Actb loci of mouse HSPCs in vitro. The targeted HSPCs engraft and reconstitute all immune cell lineages in the recipient mice. Using this approach, we corrected a neomycin-disrupted Rag2 gene. The Rag2-corrected HSPCs restore B and T cell development in vivo, confirming the functionality of the approach. Our method provides an efficient strategy to study gene function in the hematopoietic system and model hematological disorders in vivo, without the need for germline mutagenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response are energetically challenging under nutrient stress conditions. However, the regulatory mechanisms that control the energetic demand under nutrient and ER stress are largely unknown. Here we show that ER stress and glucose deprivation stimulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and formation of respiratory supercomplexes (SCs) through protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK). Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of PERK suppresses nutrient and ER stress-mediated increases in SC levels and reduces oxidative phosphorylation-dependent ATP production. Conversely, PERK activation augments respiratory SCs. The PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 axis increases supercomplex assembly factor 1 (SCAF1 or COX7A2L), promoting SCs and enhanced mitochondrial respiration. PERK activation is sufficient to rescue bioenergetic defects caused by complex I missense mutations derived from mitochondrial disease patients. These studies have identified an energetic communication between ER and mitochondria, with implications in cell survival and diseases associated with mitochondrial failures.

Abstract: Summary
Intermediary metabolism in cancer cells is regulated by diverse cell-autonomous processes, including signal transduction and gene expression patterns, arising from specific oncogenotypes and cell lineages. Although it is well established that metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, we lack a full view of the diversity of metabolic programs in cancer cells and an unbiased assessment of the associations between metabolic pathway preferences and other cell-autonomous processes. Here, we quantified metabolic features, mostly from the 13C enrichment of molecules from central carbon metabolism, in over 80 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines cultured under identical conditions. Because these cell lines were extensively annotated for oncogenotype, gene expression, protein expression, and therapeutic sensitivity, the resulting database enables the user to uncover new relationships between metabolism and these orthogonal processes.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription regulation underlies stem cell function and development. Here, we elucidate an unexpected role of an essential ribogenesis factor, WDR43, as a chromatin-associated RNA-binding protein (RBP) and release factor in modulating the polymerase (Pol) II activity for pluripotency regulation. WDR43 binds prominently to promoter-associated noncoding/nascent RNAs, occupies thousands of gene promoters and enhancers, and interacts with the Pol II machinery in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Nascent transcripts and transcription recruit WDR43 to active promoters, where WDR43 facilitates releases of the elongation factor P-TEFb and paused Pol II. Knockdown of WDR43 causes genome-wide defects in Pol II release and pluripotency-associated gene expression. Importantly, auxin-mediated rapid degradation of WDR43 drastically reduces Pol II activity, precluding indirect consequences. These results reveal an RNA-mediated recruitment and feedforward regulation on transcription and demonstrate an unforeseen role of an RBP in promoting Pol II elongation and coordinating high-level transcription and translation in ESC pluripotency.

Abstract: Domestic Pigeon (Columba livia) is one of few domesticated birds with an important economic value. In this study, a comprehensive investigation on the morphology and cytochemical patterns of peripheral blood cells in domestic pigeons were conducted by using wright’s and various cytochemical staining techniques including periodic acid-Schiff(PAS), sudan black B(SBB), peroxidase(POX), alkaline phosphatase(ALP), acid phosphatase(ACP), chloroacetic acid AS-D naphthol esterase(AS-D) and α-naphthol acetate esterase(α-NAE) staining. Besides erythrocytes and thrombocytes, five types of leukocytes were identified: heterophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. Lymphocytes were the most abundant leukocytes, followed by heterophils, eosinophils, monocytes; basophils were the fewest. Erythrocytes and thrombocytes were positive for PAS, and negative for all the other cytochemical staining. Heterophils and eosinophils exhibited positive to all cytochemical staining except for α-NAE. Basophils exhibited strongly positive for POX and AS-D, positive for PAS and ALP, while negative for SBB, ACP and α-NAE staining. Monocytes exhibited positive for PAS and α-NAE, and weakly positive for ACP, while negative for SBB, POX, ALP and AS-D staining. Lymphocytes showed positive for PAS and ACP, weakly positive for AS-D, while negative for SBB, POX, ALP and α-NAE staining. Our results add up knowledge about the domestic pigeon blood cells.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue virus (DENV) is a human arboviral pathogen accounting for 390 million infections every year. The available vaccine has limited efficacy, and DENV-specific drugs have not been generated. To better understand DENV-host cell interaction, we employed RNA interference-based screening of the human kinome and identified fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) to control the DENV replication cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR exerts a reciprocal effect by reducing DENV RNA replication and promoting the production of infectious virus particles. Addressing the latter effect, we found that the FGFR signaling pathway modulates intracellular distribution of DENV particles in a PI3K-dependent manner. Upon FGFR inhibition, virions accumulate in the trans-Golgi network compartment, where they undergo enhanced maturation cleavage of the envelope protein precursor membrane (prM), rendering virus particles more infectious. This study reveals an unexpected reciprocal role of a cellular receptor tyrosine kinase regulating DENV RNA replication and the production of infectious virions.
