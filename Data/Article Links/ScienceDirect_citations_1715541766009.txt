Abstract: Considering that stimulation of melanogenesis may lead to alterations of cellular responses, besides melanin production, our main goal was to study the cellular effects of melanogenesis stimulation of B16-F10 melanoma cells. Our results show increased levels of the reactive oxygen species after 15h of melanogenesis stimulation. Following 48h of melanogenesis stimulation, proliferation was inhibited (by induction of cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase) and the expression levels of p21 mRNA were increased. In addition, melanogenesis stimulation did not induce cellular senescence. Proteomic analysis demonstrated the involvement of proteins from other pathways besides those related to the cell cycle, including protein disulfide isomerase A3, heat-shock protein 70, and fructose biphosphate aldolase A (all up-regulated), and lactate dehydrogenase (down-regulated). In RT-qPCR experiments, the levels of pyruvate kinase M2 mRNA dropped, whereas the levels of ATP synthase (beta-F1) mRNA increased. These data indicate that melanogenesis stimulation of B16-F10 cells leads to alterations in metabolism and cell cycle progression that may contribute to an induction of cell quiescence, which may provide a mechanism of resistance against cellular injury promoted by melanin synthesis.

Abstract: Inducible heat shock protein (HspA1A) promotes tumor cell growth and survival. It also interacts with effector cells of the innate immune system and affects their activity. Recently, we showed that the direct contact of ovarian cancer cells, isolated from tumor specimens, with neutrophils intensified their biological functions. Our current experiments demonstrate that the activation of neutrophils, followed by an increased production of reactive oxygen species, by cancer cells involves the interaction of HspA1A from cancer cells with Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 expressed on the neutrophils’ surface. Our data may have a practical implication for targeted anticancer therapies based, among other factors, on the inhibition of HspA1A expression in the cancer cells.

Abstract: Interleukin (IL)-3-dependent mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) are an important model for studying the function of mucosal-type mast cells. In the present study, BMMCs were successfully immortalized by cell fusion using a hypoxanthine–aminopterin–thymidine medium-sensitive variant of P815 mouse mastocytoma (P815-6TgR) as a partner cell line. The established mouse mast cell hybridomas (MMCHs) expressed α, β, and γ subunits of high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (FcεRI) and possessed cytoplasmic granules devoid of or partially filled with electron-dense material. Four independent MMCH clones continuously proliferated without supplemental exogenous IL-3 and showed a degranulation response on stimulation with IgE+antigen. Furthermore, histamine synthesis and release by degranulation were confirmed in MMCH-D5, a MMCH clone that showed the strongest degranulation response. MMCH-D5 exhibited elevated levels of IL-3, IL-4, IL-13, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and cyclooxygenase 2, and production of prostaglandin D2 and leukotriene C4 in response to IgE-induced stimulation. MMCH clones also expressed Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1, 2, 4, and 6 and showed elevated levels of TNF-α expression in response to stimulation with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands. The MMCHs established using this method should be suitable for studies on FcεRI- and TLR-mediated effector functions of mast cells.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal epithelial cells are exposed to both innocuous and pathogenic microbes, which need to be distinguished to mount an effective immune response. To understand the mechanisms underlying pathogen recognition, we investigated how Pseudomonas aeruginosa triggers intestinal innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans, a process independent of Toll-like pattern recognition receptors. We show that the P. aeruginosa translational inhibitor Exotoxin A (ToxA), which ribosylates elongation factor 2 (EF2), upregulates a significant subset of genes normally induced by P. aeruginosa. Moreover, immune pathways involving the ATF-7 and ZIP-2 transcription factors, which protect C. elegans from P. aeruginosa, are required for preventing ToxA-mediated lethality. ToxA-responsive genes are not induced by enzymatically inactive ToxA protein but can be upregulated independently of ToxA by disruption of host protein translation. Thus, C. elegans has a surveillance mechanism to recognize ToxA through its effect on protein translation rather than by direct recognition of either ToxA or ribosylated EF2.

Abstract: Summary
Sustained expression of CagA, the type IV secretion effector of Helicobacter pylori, is closely associated with the development of gastric cancer. However, we observed that after translocation, CagA is degraded by autophagy and therefore short lived. Autophagy and CagA degradation are induced by the H. pylori vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, which acted via decreasing intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels, causing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and Akt activation. Investigating this further, we found that CagA specifically accumulated in gastric cells expressing CD44, a cell-surface marker associated with cancer stem cells. The autophagic pathway in CD44-positive gastric cancer stem-like cells is suppressed because of their resistance to ROS, which is supported by increased intracellular GSH levels. These findings provide a molecular link between H. pylori and gastric carcinogenesis through the specific accumulation of CagA in gastric cancer stem-like cells.

Abstract: Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are a type of glial cells with morphological plasticity in the olfactory system. Cultured OECs display the process-bearing and flattened shape. Our previous studies have shown that the frontal application of Slit-2 gradient induced the collapse of leading front, and reversed the soma translocation of process-bearing OECs. However, the migratory properties of flattened OECs upon Slit-2 gradient remain elusive. Here, we found that Slit-2 gradient induced the collapse of their plasma membrane, and inhibited migration of flattened OECs. Upon to Slit-2 gradient, the leading front of flattened type 1 OECs firstly showed collapse and retraction, then gradually re-grew a new lamellipodia, finally, showed collapse again (this phenomenon was called as adaptation), while flattened type 2 OECs only showed collapse of plasma membrane. These different migratory responses upon Slit-2 stimulation were possibly due to their different sub-cellular distribution of Robo receptor. Furthermore, F-actin at the peripheral region of leading front was more sensitive to the Slit-2 stimulation than microtubules and the loss of F-actin might be implicated in initiating the collapse of flattened OECs. Finally, the adaptation of flattened type 1 OECs induced by Slit-2 was independent on protein synthesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that morphological phenotypes of OECs display different migratory properties upon Slit-2 and an unexpected finding that the protein synthesis-independent adaptation in OECs induced by Slit-2.

Abstract: Neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) are susceptible to decreases in cellular immunity. In recent years, a growing body of evidence indicates that Hsp70 may serve as a danger signal to the innate immune system and promote receptor-mediated apoptosis. Using neonatal pigs with IUGR, we investigated immune function of pigs and expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and forkhead box O 3a (FoxO3a) in the intestinal tract. Samples from the blood, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of normal body weight (NBW) piglets and IUGR piglets were collected at day 7 after birth. Furthermore, to test whether Hsp70 is associated with regulation of NF-κB and FoxO3a, Hsp70 was silenced using small RNA interference (siRNA) in IEC-6 cells. Body and intestinal weights were lower in IUGR piglets than in NBW piglets (p < 0.05). Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes was decreased (p < 0.05) in IUGR piglets. Cytokine concentrations (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-1, and IL-8) were lower in serum of IUGR piglets. The levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 were decreased (p < 0.05) in the ileum of IUGR piglets, but IL-4 was increased (p < 0.05). The expressions of Hsp70 and FoxO3a were increased, and NF-κB activity was downregulated in IUGR piglets (p < 0.05). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated Hsp70 downregulation increased NF-κB activity, inhibited expression of FoxO3a, and decreased cell apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of Hsp70 inhibited NF-κB activation. In conclusion, IUGR impairs immune functions in neonatal pigs. An inefficient immunity in IUGR piglets is associated with overexpression of Hsp70, which impairs NF-κB signaling and upregulates FoxO3a expression.

Abstract: Summary
The expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) causes the cellular “antiviral state” in which the replication of many viruses, including HIV-1, is attenuated. We conducted a screen for ISGs that inhibit HIV-1 virion production and found that 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP), a membrane-associated protein with unknown function in mammals has this property. CNP binds to the structural protein Gag and blocks HIV-1 particle assembly after Gag and viral RNA have associated with the plasma membrane. Several primate lentiviruses are CNP-sensitive, and CNP sensitivity/resistance is determined by a single, naturally dimorphic, codon (E/K40) in the matrix domain of Gag. Like other antiretroviral proteins, CNP displays interspecies variation in antiviral activity. Mice encode an inactive CNP variant and a single amino acid difference in murine versus human CNP determines Gag binding and antiviral activity. Some cell types express high levels of CNP and we speculate that CNP evolved to restrict lentivirus replication therein.

Abstract: Wnt4, a member of the Wnt superfamily of signaling molecules, is critical for mammalian kidney development, since nephrogenesis fails in its absence, while Wnt4 signaling induces mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition and associated tubulogenesis in the uninduced mesenchymal cells in the classic transfilter model. The factors that promote Wnt4 gene expression during kidney development are largely unknown, however. We addressed the upstream regulators of the Wnt4 gene and describe here the transcription factors WT1 and Sox11 as candidate molecules in the control of gene expression. We found that WT1/Sox11 regulate Wnt4 promoter expression in a synergistic fashion in an embryonic kidney mesenchyme-derived cell line model. The transcription complex containing WT1/Sox11 was immunoprecipitated from embryonic kidney cells with Sox11 antibodies, suggesting their presence in the same complex. Dominant negative forms of WT1, namely P129L and F154S mutants, inhibited Wnt4 expression, but this inhibition was not influenced by the presence of wild-type Sox11. The mutant WT1 forms were similarly incapable of interacting with Sox11, as judged by reporter studies. The spatio-temporal expression pattern of wt1 and sox11 overlaps with that of Wnt4 in the early Xenopus pronephros. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of either wt1 or sox11 inhibited Wnt4 expression in the prospective pronephros of the Xenopus embryos. We propose that Sox11 represents a synergistic factor for WT1 in regulating the Wnt4 gene expression that is critical for nephrogenesis during kidney ontogeny.

Abstract: Summary
Bornaviruses are nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses that establish a persistent infection in the nucleus and occasionally integrate a DNA genome copy into the host chromosomal DNA. However, how these viruses achieve intranuclear infection remains unclear. We show that Borna disease virus (BDV), a mammalian bornavirus, closely associates with the cellular chromosome to ensure intranuclear infection. BDV generates viral factories within the nucleus using host chromatin as a scaffold. In addition, the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) interacts directly with the host chromosome throughout the cell cycle, using core histones as a docking platform. HMGB1, a host chromatin-remodeling DNA architectural protein, is required to stabilize RNP on chromosomes and for efficient BDV RNA transcription in the nucleus. During metaphase, the association of RNP with mitotic chromosomes allows the viral RNA to segregate into daughter cells and ensure persistent infection. Thus, bornaviruses likely evolved a chromosome-dependent life cycle to achieve stable intranuclear infection.

Abstract: Recent studies have described the occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction in human stem/stromal cells (SCs), particularly after extensive passaging in vitro and/or expansion under low oxygen tensions. To deepen this knowledge we investigated the influence of hypoxia (2% O2) and prolonged passaging (>P10) of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) on the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle regulation pathways, as well as on the occurrence of microsatellite instability and changes in telomere length. Our results show that hypoxic conditions induce an immediate and concerted down-regulation of genes involved in DNA repair and damage response pathways (MLH1, RAD51, BRCA1, and Ku80), concomitantly with the occurrence of microsatellite instability while maintaining telomere length. We further searched for mutations occurring in the mitochondrial genome, and monitored changes in intracellular ATP content, membrane potential and mitochondrial DNA content. Hypoxia led to a simultaneous decrease in ATP content and in the number of mitochondrial genomes, whereas the opposite effect was observed after prolonged passaging. Moreover, we show that neither hypoxia nor prolonged passaging significantly affected the integrity of the mitochondrial genome. Ultimately, we present evidence on how hypoxia selectively impacts the cellular response of BMSCs and ASCs, thus pointing for the need to optimize oxygen tension according to the cell source.

Abstract: Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dsk1 is an SR protein-specific kinase (SRPK), whose homologs have been identified in every eukaryotic organism examined. Although discovered as a mitotic regulator with protein kinase activity toward SR splicing factors, it remains largely unknown about what and how Dsk1 contributes to cell cycle and pre-mRNA splicing. In this study, we investigated the Dsk1 function by determining interacting factors and cellular localization of the kinase. Consistent with its reported functions, we found that pre-mRNA processing and cell cycle factors are prominent among the proteins co-purified with Dsk1. The identification of these factors led us to find Rsd1 as a novel Dsk1 substrate, as well as the involvement of Dsk1 in cellular distribution of poly(A)+ RNA. In agreement with its role in nuclear events, we also found that Dsk1 is mainly localized in the nucleus during G2 phase and at mitosis. Furthermore, we revealed the oscillation of Dsk1 protein in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This paper marks the first comprehensive analysis of in vivo Dsk1-associated proteins in fission yeast. Our results reflect the conserved role of SRPK family in eukaryotic organisms, and provide information about how Dsk1 functions in pre-mRNA processing and cell-division cycle.

Abstract: CLP36 is a member of the ALP/Enigma protein family and has been shown to be localized to stress fibers in various cells. We previously reported that depletion of CLP36 caused loss of stress fibers in BeWo choriocarcinoma cells, but it remains unclear how CLP36 contributes to stress fiber formation. In this study, we generated CLP36-depleted F2408 fibroblasts and found that stress fibers showed abnormal non-oriented organization in these cells. In addition to CLP36, F2408 cells contained RIL, another ALP/Enigma protein, and we demonstrated that RIL could compensate for the role of CLP36 in stress fiber formation. CLP36 and RIL form a complex with α-actinin-1 and palladin. We found a strong correlation between loss of CLP36/RIL and failure of α-actinin-1 or palladin to localize on stress fibers. In addition, time lapse observation revealed that incorporation of RIL stabilizes stress fibers and that CLP36 influences the dynamic architecture of these fibers. Our findings indicate that CLP36 and RIL have a redundant role in the formation of stress fibers, but have different effects on stress fiber dynamics in F2408 cells.

Abstract: A deliberate generation of ROS is now recognized to be achieved by specific NADPH oxidases (NOX). Dual oxidases (DUOXs) are Ca2+-activated NOXs and operate as H2O2-generators in various tissues. A tight regulation is however required to avoid ROS overproduction that can rapidly be harmful to biological systems. DUOX activator (DUOXA) proteins act as organizing elements for surface expression and activity of the DUOX enzymes. To study DUOX activation by the maturation factors, chimeric DUOXA proteins were generated by replacing particular domains between DUOXA1 and DUOXA2. Their impact on DUOX function and membrane expression were explored in a reconstituted heterologous cell system composed of COS-7 cells. We have shown that the COOH-terminal end of DUOXA1 is responsible for DUOX1-dependent H2O2 generation. The NH2-terminal tail of DUOXA2 is critical to specify the type of ROS released by DUOX2, hydrogen peroxide or superoxide. Native DUOXA2 would constrain DUOX2 to produce H2O2. However, alterations of the DUOXA2 NH2-terminal domain modify DUOX2 activity triggering superoxide leaking. Our results demonstrate that specific domains of the DUOX maturation factors promote the activation of DUOXs as well as the type of ROS generated by the oxidases.

Abstract: Summary
With renewed calls for malaria eradication, next-generation antimalarials need be active against drug-resistant parasites and efficacious against both liver- and blood-stage infections. We screened a natural product library to identify inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum blood- and liver-stage proliferation. Cladosporin, a fungal secondary metabolite whose target and mechanism of action are not known for any species, was identified as having potent, nanomolar, antiparasitic activity against both blood and liver stages. Using postgenomic methods, including a yeast deletion strains collection, we show that cladosporin specifically inhibits protein synthesis by directly targeting P. falciparum cytosolic lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Further, cladosporin is >100-fold more potent against parasite lysyl-tRNA synthetase relative to the human enzyme, which is conferred by the identity of two amino acids within the enzyme active site. Our data indicate that lysyl-tRNA synthetase is an attractive, druggable, antimalarial target that can be selectively inhibited.

Abstract: Temperature is one of the most important variables influencing organisms, especially in the intertidal zone. This work aimed to test physiological and molecular intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance of the crab Pachygrapsus marmoratus (Fabricius, 1787). The comparisons made focused on sex, size, and habitat (estuary and coast) differences. The physiological parameter was upper thermal limit, tested via the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and the molecular parameter was total heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70 and Hsp70 plus Hsc70) production, quantified via an enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay. Results showed that CTMax values and Hsp70 production are higher in females probably due to different microhabitat use and potentially due to different hormonal regulation in males and females. Among females, non-reproducing ones showed a higher CTMax value, but no differences were found in Hsp70, even though reproducing females showed higher variability in Hsp70 amounts. As reproduction takes up a lot of energy, its allocation for other activities, including stress responses, is lower. Juveniles also showed higher CTMax and Hsp70 expression because they occur in greater shore heights and ageing leads to alterations in protein synthesis. Comparing estuarine and coastal crabs, no differences were found in CTMax but coastal crabs produce more Hsp70 than estuarine crabs because they occur in drier and hotter areas than estuarine ones, which occur in moister environments. This work shows the importance of addressing intraspecific differences in the stress response at different organizational levels. This study shows that these differences are key factors in stress research, climate research, and environmental monitoring.

The host protein tetherin (BST-2) inhibits HIV release from the plasma membrane by retaining viral particles at the cell surface, but the role of tetherin at intracellular HIV assembly sites is unclear. We determined that tetherin is significantly upregulated upon macrophage infection and localizes to an intracellular virus-containing compartment (VCC). Tetherin localized at the virus-VCC membrane interface, suggesting that tetherin physically tethers virions in VCCs. Tetherin knockdown diminished and redistributed VCCs within macrophages and promoted HIV release and cell-cell transmission. The HIV Vpu protein, which downregulates tetherin from the plasma membrane, did not fully overcome tetherin-mediated restriction of particle release in macrophages. Thus, tetherin is essential for VCC formation and may account for morphologic differences in the apparent HIV assembly sites in macrophages versus T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis persists within macrophages in an arrested phagosome and depends upon necrosis to elude immunity and disseminate. Although apoptosis of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages is associated with reduced bacterial growth, the bacteria are relatively resistant to other forms of death, leaving the mechanism underlying this observation unresolved. We find that after apoptosis, M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages are rapidly taken up by uninfected macrophages through efferocytosis, a dedicated apoptotic cell engulfment process. Efferocytosis of M. tuberculosis sequestered within an apoptotic macrophage further compartmentalizes the bacterium and delivers it along with the apoptotic cell debris to the lysosomal compartment. M. tuberculosis is killed only after efferocytosis, indicating that apoptosis itself is not intrinsically bactericidal but requires subsequent phagocytic uptake and lysosomal fusion of the apoptotic body harboring the bacterium. While efferocytosis is recognized as a constitutive housekeeping function of macrophages, these data indicate that it can also function as an antimicrobial effector mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Successful pathogens have evolved to evade innate immune recognition of microbial molecules by pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which control microbial growth in host tissues. Upon Legionella pneumophila infection of macrophages, the cytosolic PRR Nod1 recognizes anhydro-disaccharide-tetrapeptide (anhDSTP) generated by soluble lytic transglycosylase (SltL), the predominant bacterial peptidoglycan degrading enzyme, to activate NF-κB-dependent innate immune responses. We show that L. pneumophila periplasmic protein EnhC, which is uniquely required for bacterial replication within macrophages, interferes with SltL to lower anhDSTP production. L. pneumophila mutant strains lacking EnhC (ΔenhC) increase Nod1-dependent NF-κB activation in host cells, while reducing SltL activity in a ΔenhC strain restores intracellular bacterial growth. Further, L. pneumophila ΔenhC is specifically rescued in Nod1- but not Nod2-deficient macrophages, arguing that EnhC facilitates evasion from Nod1 recognition. These results indicate that a bacterial pathogen regulates peptidoglycan degradation to control the production of PRR ligands and evade innate immune recognition.

Abstract: Rho GTPase functions have been carefully investigated for many years using cell biological models. In recent years, mouse models with targeted mutations in Rho GTPase genes enabled the study of Rho GTPase function in vivo, partially confirming and partially contradicting expectations based on earlier in vitro experiments. This review sums up recent findings on the role of Rho GTPases in development, underlining the importance of in vivo research for our understanding of Rho GTPases in living organisms, and describing challenges for the future.

Transient inhibition of cell proliferation does not compromise self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells,

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have unlimited capacity for self-renewal and can differentiate into various cell types when induced. They also have an unusual cell cycle control mechanism driven by constitutively active cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks). In mouse ESCs (mESCs). It is proposed that the rapid cell proliferation could be a necessary part of mechanisms that maintain mESC self-renewal and pluripotency, but this hypothesis is not in line with the finding in human ESCs (hESCs) that the length of the cell cycle is similar to differentiated cells. Therefore, whether rapid cell proliferation is essential for the maintenance of mESC state remains unclear. We provide insight into this uncertainty through chemical intervention of mESC cell cycle. We report here that inhibition of Cdks with olomoucine II can dramatically slow down cell proliferation of mESCs with concurrent down-regulation of cyclin A, B and E, and the activation of the Rb pathway. However, mESCs display can recover upon the removal of olomoucine II and are able to resume normal cell proliferation without losing self-renewal and pluripotency, as demonstrated by the expression of ESC markers, colony formation, embryoid body formation, and induced differentiation. We provide a mechanistic explanation for these observations by demonstrating that Oct4 and Nanog, two major transcription factors that play critical roles in the maintenance of ESC properties, are up-regulated via de novo protein synthesis when the cells are exposed to olomoucine II. Together, our data suggest that short-term inhibition of cell proliferation does not compromise the basic properties of mESCs.

Abstract: HSPA1A (HSP70-1) is a highly inducible heat shock gene up-regulated in response to environmental stresses and pollutants. The aim of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the stable metabolically competent HepG2 cells containing a human HSPA1A promoter-driven luciferase reporter (HepG2-luciferase cells) for assessing the toxicity of organic pollutants present in air. The HepG2-luciferase cells were validated by heat shock treatment and testing three organic compounds (pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, and formaldehyde) that are ubiquitous in the air. The maximal level of HSPA1A (HSP70-1) and relative luciferase activity induced by heat shock were over three and nine times the control level, respectively. Pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, and formaldehyde all induced significantly elevated levels of relative luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Extractable organic matter (EOM) from urban traffic and coke oven emissions in ambient air were tested on the HepG2-luciferase cells. The traffic EOM induced significant increase in relative luciferase activity at concentrations of picogram per liter. The coke oven EOM produced a strong dose-dependent induction of relative luciferase activity up to six times the control value. Significant increases in relative luciferase activity were observed at concentrations that were as low, or lower than the concentrations that the tested organic pollutants decreased cell viability, and increased malondialdehyde concentration, Olive tail moment, and micronuclei frequency. Therefore, we conclude that the HepG2-luciferase cells are a valuable tool for rapid screening of the overall toxicity of organic pollutants present in air.

Abstract: Tight regulation of cell numbers by controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis is important during development. Recently, the Hippo pathway has been shown to regulate tissue growth and organ size in Drosophila. In mammalian cells, it also affects cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues, including the nervous system. Interplay of several signaling cascades, such as Notch, Wnt, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathways, control cell proliferation during neuronal differentiation. However, it remains unclear whether the Hippo pathway coordinates with other signaling cascades in regulating neuronal differentiation. Here, we used P19 cells, a mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line, as a model to study roles of YAP, a core component of the Hippo pathway, in neuronal differentiation. P19 cells can be induced to differentiate into neurons by expressing a neural bHLH transcription factor gene Ascl1. Our results showed that YAP promoted cell proliferation and inhibited neuronal differentiation. Expression of Yap activated Shh but not Wnt or Notch signaling activity during neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, expression of Yap increased the expression of Patched homolog 1 (Ptch1), a downstream target of the Shh signaling. Knockdown of Gli2, a transcription factor of the Shh pathway, promoted neuronal differentiation even when Yap was over-expressed. We further demonstrated that over-expression of Yap inhibited neuronal differentiation in primary mouse cortical progenitors and Gli2 knockdown rescued the differentiation defect in Yap over-expressing cells. In conclusion, our study reveals that Shh signaling acts downstream of YAP in regulating neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Neural transplantation in experimental parkinsonism (PD) is limited by poor survival of grafted embryonic dopaminergic (DA) cells. In this proof-of-principle study we hypothesized that a first regular initial graft may create a “dopaminergic” environment similar to the perinatal substantia nigra and consequently stimulate a subsequent graft. Therefore, we grafted ventral mesencephalic neurons sequentially at different time intervals into the same target localization. Rats with a unilateral lesion of the dopamine neurons produced by injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) received E14 ventral mesencephalon derived grafts into the DA-depleted striatum. In the control group we grafted all 6 deposits on the first day (d0). The other 4 groups received four graft deposits distributed over 2 implantation tracts followed by a second engraftment injected into the same site 3, 6, 14 and 21 days later. Quantitative assessment of the survival of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons and graft volume revealed best results for those DA grafts implanted 6 days after the first one. In the present study, a model of short-interval sequential transplantation into the same target-site, so called “nest” grafts were established in the 6-OHDA rat model of PD which might become a useful tool to further elucidate the close neurotrophic and neurotopic interactions between the immediate graft vicinity and the cell suspension graft. In addition, we could show that the optimal milieu was established around the sixth day after the initial transplantation. This may also help to further optimize current transplantation strategies to restore the DA system in patients with PD.

Abstract: Here we report that Prostate Cancer (PCa) cell-lines DU145, PC3, LNCaP and RWPE-1 grown in 3D matrices in contrast to conventional 2D monolayers, display distinct differences in cell morphology, proliferation and expression of important biomarker proteins associated with cancer progression. Consistent with in vivo growth rates, in 3D cultures, all PCa cell-lines were found to proliferate at significantly lower rates in comparison to their 2D counterparts. Moreover, when grown in a 3D matrix, metastatic PC3 cell-lines were found to mimic more precisely protein expression patterns of metastatic tumour formation as found in vivo. In comparison to the prostate epithelial cell-line RWPE-1, metastatic PC3 cell-lines exhibited a down-regulation of E-cadherin and α6 integrin expression and an up-regulation of N-cadherin, Vimentin and β1 integrin expression and re-expressed non-transcriptionally active AR. In comparison to the non-invasive LNCaP cell-lines, PC3 cells were found to have an up-regulation of chemokine receptor CXCR4, consistent with a metastatic phenotype. In 2D cultures, there was little distinction in protein expression between metastatic, non-invasive and epithelial cells. These results suggest that 3D cultures are more representative of in vivo morphology and may serve as a more biologically relevant model in the drug discovery pipeline.

Abstract: All-trans-retinoic acid (RA), the major active metabolite of vitamin A, is a regulator of gene expression with many roles in cell differentiation. In the present study, we investigated RA in the regulation of MafB, a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor with broad roles in embryonic development, hematopoiesis and monocyte-macrophage differentiation. In RA-treated THP-1 human monocytic cells, MafB mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated by RA dose and time-dependently, while, additionally, RA and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, also known to induce monocyte to macrophage differentiation, increased MafB expression synergistically. Screening of potential targets containing Maf recognition elements (MARE motifs) in their promoter regions identified SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 as potential targets; these genes are related to cell communication, recruitment and differentiation, respectively. Across cell treatments, SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 mRNA levels were highly correlated (P<0.001) with MafB. ChIP assays demonstrated increased MafB protein binding to MARE elements in the promoter regions of SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 in RA and TNFα-treated cells, as well as acetylation of histone-H4 in MARE-containing regions, indicative of chromatin activation. Conversely, reducing MafB protein by microRNA silencing significantly decreased the expression of SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 (P<0.01). Moreover, the reduction in MafB expression and these downstream targets correlated with decreased cell differentiation as determined by cell-surface CD11b expression and phagocytic activity. We conclude that MafB may be a key factor in mediating the ability of RA and TNFα to regulate monocytic cell communication, recruitment and differentiation through regulation of MafB target genes including SPOCK1, CCL2 and Blimp1.

Abstract: Regulation of basal and induced levels of hsp70 is critical for cellular homeostasis. Ataxin-3 is a deubiquitinase with several cellular functions including transcriptional regulation and maintenance of protein homeostasis. While investigating potential roles of ataxin-3 in response to cellular stress, it appeared that ataxin-3 regulated hsp70. Basal levels of hsp70 were lower in ataxin-3 knockout (KO) mouse brain from 2 to 63 weeks of age and hsp70 was also lower in fibroblasts from ataxin-3 KO mice. Transfecting KO cells with ataxin-3 rescued basal levels of hsp70 protein. Western blots of representative chaperones including hsp110, hsp90, hsp70, hsc70, hsp60, hsp40/hdj2, and hsp25 indicated that only hsp70 was appreciably altered in KO fibroblasts and KO mouse brain. Turnover of hsp70 protein was similar in wild-type (WT) and KO cells; however, basal hsp70 promoter reporter activity was decreased in ataxin-3 KO cells. Transfecting ataxin-3 restored hsp70 basal promoter activity in KO fibroblasts to levels of promoter activity in WT cells; however, mutations that inactivated deubiquitinase activity or the ubiquitin interacting motifs did not restore full activity to hsp70 basal promoter activity. Hsp70 protein and promoter activity were higher in WT compared to KO cells exposed to heat shock and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, but WT and KO cells had similar levels in response to cadmium. Heat shock factor-1 had decreased levels and increased turnover in ataxin-3 KO fibroblasts. Data in this study are consistent with ataxin-3 regulating basal level of hsp70 as well as modulating hsp70 in response to a subset of cellular stresses.

Abstract: Summary
Erythrocytes carrying a variant hemoglobin allele (HbS), which causes sickle cell disease and resists infection by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The molecular basis of this resistance, which has long been recognized as multifactorial, remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) composition, of either heterozygous HbAS or homozygous HbSS erythrocytes, contributes to resistance against P. falciparum. During the intraerythrocytic life cycle of P. falciparum, a subset of erythrocyte miRNAs translocate into the parasite. Two miRNAs, miR-451 and let-7i, were highly enriched in HbAS and HbSS erythrocytes, and these miRNAs, along with miR-223, negatively regulated parasite growth. Surprisingly, we found that miR-451 and let-7i integrated into essential parasite messenger RNAs and, via impaired ribosomal loading, resulted in translational inhibition. Hence, sickle cell erythrocytes exhibit cell-intrinsic resistance to malaria in part through an atypical miRNA activity, which may represent a unique host defense strategy against complex eukaryotic pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
The RIG-I/Mda5 sensors recognize viral intracellular RNA and trigger host antiviral responses. RIG-I signals through the adaptor protein MAVS, which engages various TRAF family members and results in type I interferon (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokine production via activation of IRFs and NF-κB, respectively. Both the IRF and NF-κB pathways also require the adaptor protein NEMO. We determined that the RIG-I pathway is differentially regulated by the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), which consists of the E3 ligases HOIL-1L, HOIP, and the accessory protein SHARPIN. LUBAC downregulated virus-mediated IFN induction by targeting NEMO for linear ubiquitination. Linear ubiquitinated NEMO associated with TRAF3 and disrupted the MAVS-TRAF3 complex, which inhibited IFN activation while stimulating NF-κB-dependent signaling. In SHARPIN-deficient MEFs, vesicular stomatitis virus replication was decreased due to increased IFN production. Linear ubiquitination thus switches NEMO from a positive to a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling, resulting in an attenuated IFN response.

Abstract: Species distribution, abundance, and long-term survival are determined by biotic and abiotic regimes. However, little is known about the importance of these factors in species range expansion. Styela plicata is a solitary ascidian introduced all over the world by ship fouling, including salt marsh habitats, where introduced populations must tolerate high seasonal variations in temperature and salinity. To determine the seasonal stress levels in a salt marsh population of S. plicata, we quantified heat shock protein (hsp70) gene expression using quantitative real-time PCR throughout a 2-year cycle. Results showed that hsp70 expression varied over time, with higher stress levels recorded in summer and winter. Periodic conditions of high temperatures, particularly when coupled with low salinities, increased hsp70 gene expression. Mortality events observed every year around June were concurrent with sharp increases in temperature (>6°C), indicating that drastic changes in abiotic factors may overwhelm the observed stress response mechanisms. Determining the ability of introduced species to cope with stress, and the thresholds above which these mechanisms fail, is fundamental to predict the potential expansion range of introduced species and design efficient containment plans.

Abstract: Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is a naturally occurring electrophile which depletes intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels and triggers accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PEITC is of considerable interest as a potential chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent, and in this work, we have investigated the effects of PEITC on human breast cancer cell lines. Whereas PEITC readily induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (associated with rapid activation of caspases 9 and 3, and decreased expression of BAX), MCF7 cells were relatively resistant to the apoptosis promoting effects of PEITC. The relative resistance of MCF7 cells was associated with high basal expression of NRF2, a transcription factor that coordinates cellular protective responses to oxidants and electrophiles and raised intracellular levels of GSH. This raised basal expression of NRF2 appeared to be a response to on-going production of ROS, since treatment with the antioxidant and GSH precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced NRF2 expression. Moreover, pre-treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with NAC rendered these cells relatively resistant to PEITC-induced apoptosis. In summary, our data confirm that PEITC may be an effective chemopreventive/therapeutic agents for breast cancer. However, differences in the basal expression of NRF2 and resultant changes in GSH levels may be an important determinant of sensitivity to PEITC-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: The modification of proteins by ubiquitination and deubiquitination plays an important role in various cellular processes. BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme whose function in the control of the cell cycle requires both its deubiquitinating activity and nuclear localization. In the present study, a ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase belonging to the BAP1 family was identified and characterized from Artemia parthenogenetica, a member of a family of brine shrimp that, under certain conditions, produce and release diapause embryos in which cell division and turnover of macromolecules are arrested. Western blot analysis and in vitro enzyme activity assay revealed ArBAP1 to be a cytoplasmic protein with typical ubiquitin hydrolase activity. Northern blot analysis revealed that ArBAP1 was abundant in the abdomen of Artemia producing diapause-destined embryos. Furthermore, by in situ hybridization, ArBAP1 was located exclusively in the embryos. In vivo knockdown of ArBAP1 by RNA interference resulted in the formation of embryos with split shells and abortive nauplii. The present findings suggest that ArBAP1, the first reported cytoplasmic BAP1, participates in the formation of diapause embryos and plays an important role in the control of cell cycle arrest in these encysted embryos.

It also evaluated whether bovine embryos can respond to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced with ultraviolet irradiation by regulating expression of genes involved in HR and NHEJ repair pathways. Embryos with high, intermediate or low developmental competence were selected based on the cleavage time after in vitro insemination and were removed from in vitro culture before (36h), during (72h) and after (96h) the expected period of embryonic genome activation. All studied genes were expressed before, during and after the genome activation period regardless the developmental competence of the embryos. Higher mRNA expression of 53BP1 and RAD52 was found before genome activation in embryos with low developmental competence. Expression of 53BP1, RAD51 and KU70 was downregulated at 72h and upregulated at 168h post-insemination in response to DSBs induced by ultraviolet irradiation. In conclusion, important genes controlling HR and NHEJ DNA-repair pathways are expressed in bovine embryos, however genes participating in these pathways are only regulated after the period of embryo genome activation in response to ultraviolet-induced DSBs.

Abstract: Tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX; ENOX2) is a growth-related protein expressed in transformed cells. Consistent with this function, tNOX knockdown by RNA interference leads to a significant reduction in cell proliferation and migration in HeLa cells, whereas tNOX overexpression confers an aggressive phenotype. Here, for the first time, we report that tNOX is phosphorylated by protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) both in vitro and in vivo. Replacement of serine-504 with alanine significantly reduces phosphorylation by PKCδ. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal an interaction between tNOX and PKCδ. Moreover, whereas overexpression of wild-type tNOX in NIH3T3 cells increases cell proliferation and migration, overexpression of the S504A tNOX mutant leads to diminished cell proliferation and migration, reflecting reduced stability of the unphosphorylatable tNOX mutant protein. Collectively, these results suggest that phosphorylation of serine-504 by PKCδ modulates the biological function of tNOX.

Abstract: Abnormal heat shock protein (HSP) levels have been observed in a number of human tumours, where they are involved in all hallmarks of cancer. Since bovine urothelial tumours share striking morphological and biochemical features with their human counterparts, the aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical levels of Hsp27, Hsp60, Hsp72, Hsp73 and Hsp90 in 28 normal bovine urinary bladders and 30 bovine papillomavirus-positive urothelial tumours (9 in situ carcinomas, 9 low-grade and 12 high-grade carcinomas) and adjacent premalignant lesions obtained from cows suffering from chronic enzootic haematuria, in order to investigate the role of these proteins in the process of urothelial carcinogenesis. A semi-quantitative method was used for the analysis of the results. Western blot analysis was also used to confirm HSP expression in normal controls. All investigated HSPs were expressed in normal bovine urothelium, showing characteristic patterns of immunolabelling throughout urothelial cell layers, which usually appeared to be conserved in urothelial hyperplasia and dysplasia. On the other hand, gradual loss of Hsp27 immunostaining resulted to be significantly associated with increasing histological grade of malignancy (P < 0.01). As well, a significantly reduced immunosignal of Hsp73 and Hsp90 was observed in high-grade and low-/high-grade carcinomas, respectively (P < 0.01). In contrast, Hsp60 (P < 0.01) and Hsp72 (P < 0.05) immunoreactivity appeared to be significantly increased both in premalignant and malignant lesions when compared to that observed in normal urothelium, thus suggesting an early involvement of these proteins in neoplastic transformation of urinary bladder mucosa.

Abstract: Cell populations often display heterogeneous behavior, including cell-to-cell variations in morphology, adhesion and spreading. However, better understanding the significance of such cell variations for the function of the population as a whole requires quantitative single-cell assays. To investigate adhesion variability in a CHO cell population in detail, we measured integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin and collagen, two ubiquitous ECM components, by AFM-based single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS). CHO cells generally adhered more strongly to laminin than collagen but population adhesion force distributions to both ECM components were broad and partially overlapped. To determine the levels of laminin and collagen binding in individual cells directly, we alternatingly measured single cells on adjacent microstripes of collagen and laminin arrayed on the same adhesion substrate. In repeated measurements (≥60) individual cells showed a stable and ECM type-specific adhesion response. All tested cells bound laminin more strongly, but the scale of laminin over collagen binding varied between cells. Together, this demonstrates that adhesion levels to different ECM components are tightly yet differently set in each cell of the population. Adhesion variability to laminin was non-genetic and cell cycle-independent but scaled with the range of α6 integrin expression on the cell surface. Adhesive cell-to-cell variations due to varying receptor expression levels thus appear to be an inherent feature of cell populations and should to be considered when fully characterizing population adhesion. In this approach, SCFS performed on multifunctional adhesion substrates can provide quantitative single-cell information not obtainable from population-averaging measurements on homogeneous adhesion substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play key regulatory roles in the life cycle of the malaria parasite, but in many cases their precise molecular functions are unknown. Using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, we show that CDPK1, which is known to be essential in the asexual blood stage of the parasite, is expressed in all life stages and is indispensable during the sexual mosquito life-cycle stages. Knockdown of CDPK1 in sexual stages resulted in developmentally arrested parasites and prevented mosquito transmission, and these effects were independent of the previously proposed function for CDPK1 in regulating parasite motility. In-depth translational and transcriptional profiling of arrested parasites revealed that CDPK1 translationally activates mRNA species in the developing zygote that in macrogametes remain repressed via their 3′ and 5′UTRs. These findings indicate that CDPK1 is a multifunctional protein that translationally regulates mRNAs to ensure timely and stage-specific protein expression.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are innate immune cells that counter pathogens by many mechanisms, including release of antimicrobial proteins such as calprotectin to inhibit bacterial growth. Calprotectin sequesters essential micronutrient metals such as zinc, thereby limiting their availability to microbes, a process termed nutritional immunity. We find that while calprotectin is induced by neutrophils during infection with the gut pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium, calprotectin-mediated metal sequestration does not inhibit S. Typhimurium proliferation. Remarkably, S. Typhimurium overcomes calprotectin-mediated zinc chelation by expressing a high affinity zinc transporter (ZnuABC). A S. Typhimurium znuA mutant impaired for growth in the inflamed gut was rescued in the absence of calprotectin. ZnuABC was also required to promote the growth of S. Typhimurium over that of competing commensal bacteria. Thus, our findings indicate that Salmonella thrives in the inflamed gut by overcoming the zinc sequestration of calprotectin and highlight the importance of zinc acquisition in bacterial intestinal colonization.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that repress the expression of their target genes post-transcriptionally. MiRNAs participate in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, including development and diseases. However, the functional role and molecular mechanism by which miRNAs regulate skeletal muscle development and differentiation are not fully understood. In this report, we identified miR-23a as a key regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation. Using bioinformatics analyses, miR-23a is predicted to target multiple adult fast myosin heavy chain (Myh) genes, including Myh 1, 2 and 4. Luciferase reporter assays show that miR-23a directly targets the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of these mRNAs. Interestingly, the expression level of mature miR-23a is inversely correlated with myogenic progression in mouse skeletal muscle. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies using C2C12 myoblasts demonstrate that miR-23a inhibits myogenic differentiation. These findings therefore reveal a novel role of miR-23a in regulating myogenic differentiation via inhibiting the expression of fast myosin heavy chain isoforms.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) is a highly conserved and multi-functional molecular chaperone that plays an essential role in both cellular metabolism and stress response. Portunus trituberculatus is an important marine fishery and aquaculture species, and water salinity condition influenced its artificial propagations significantly. In order to investigate the function of P. trituberculatus HSP60 against osmotic stress, P. trituberculatus HSP60 gene was firstly cloned. The full-length cDNA of PtHSP60 contains 1,743 nucleotides encoding 577 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 61.25 kDa. Multiple alignments indicated that the deduced amino acid sequences of PtHSP60 shared a high level of identity with invertebrate and vertebrate HSP60 sequence including shrimp, fruit fly, zebrafish, and human. The expression profiles of PtHSP60 at mRNA and protein levels under salinity treatment were investigated by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. It was found that the mRNA transcripts of PtHSP60 gene varied among different tissues under normal salinity conditions, and the antennal gland showed the highest expression level among the tissues tested. As for low salinity challenge, the mRNA expression of PtHSP60 gene was higher in the gill and appendicular muscle compared with other tissues, and gill and hypodermis represented the higher gene expressions during the hyperosmotic stress, which indicated that those tissues were salinity-sensitive tissues. In addition, salinity challenges significantly altered the expression of PtHSP60 at mRNA and protein level in a salinity- and time-dependent manner in P. trituberculatus gill tissue. The results indicate that PtHSP60 played important roles in mediating the salinity stress in P. trituberculatus.

Abstract: Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) represent promising tools for cellular therapy owing to their multipotentiality and ability to localize to injured, inflamed sites and tumor. Various approaches to manipulate expression of MSC surface markers, including adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors, have been explored to enhance homing of MSCs. Recently, Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) has been found to be expressed on MSCs yet its function remains largely elusive. Herein, we show that bone marrow-derived MSCs from NCAM deficient mice exhibit defective migratory ability and significantly impaired adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. We further explore the mechanism governing NCAM mediated migration of MSCs by showing the interplay between NCAM and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) induces activation of MAPK/ERK signaling, thereby the migration of MSCs. In addition, re-expression of NCAM180, but not NCAM140, could restore the defective MAPK/ERK signaling thereby the migration of NCAM deficient MSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that NCAM180 expression level could be manipulated by pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α treatment. Overall, our data reveal the vital function of NCAM in MSCs migration and differentiation thus raising the possibility of manipulating NCAM expression to enhance homing and therapeutic potential of MSCs in cellular therapy.

Abstract: Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMA) and malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) have a frequent metastatic spread and a poor prognosis. Aberrant miRNA expression is often found in metastatic tumors. The aim of this study was to identify specific miRNA expression patterns in these tumors. We analyzed the expression of miRNAs in RMA and MRT in tissue samples and in the rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines (Rh30 and RD). Selected target miRNAs were modulated with mimic or inhibitor oligonucleotides. Functional analysis was monitored by flow cytometry and migration assays. A set of 107 differentially expressed miRNAs showed tissue-specific clustering of RMA and MRT. Comparison with the Sarcoma microRNA Expression Database revealed RMA- and MRT-specific miRNAs. Metastatic invasion associated miRNA miR-9⁎ was overexpressed in RMA. miR-200c—inhibiting migration—was lower expressed in RMA than in MRT. Transient transfection of RMS cells with a miR-200c mimic and miR-9* inhibitor did neither increase the expression of the known target E-cadherin nor decrease migration. Expression of E-cadherin could be induced in RD cells using decitabine, but demethylation did not influence cell migration. Despite a comparable high rate of metastatic invasion pediatric RMA and MRT show a different pattern of miRNA expression possibly allowing risk stratification.

Abstract: The adapters IRS1 and IRS2 link growth factor receptors to downstream signaling pathways that regulate proliferation and survival. Both suppress factor-withdrawal-induced apoptosis and have been implicated in cancer progression. However, recent studies suggest IRS1 and IRS2 mediate differential functions in cancer pathogenesis. IRS1 promoted breast cancer proliferation, while IRS2 promoted metastasis. The role of IRS1 and IRS2 in controlling cell responses to chemotherapy is unknown. To determine the role of IRS1 and IRS2 in the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy, we treated 32D cells lacking or expressing IRS proteins with various concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents. We found that expression of IRS1, in contrast to IRS2, enhanced the sensitivity of 32D cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. When IRS2 was expressed with IRS1, the cells no longer showed enhanced sensitivity. Expression of IRS1 did not alter the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins; however, 32D-IRS1 cells expressed higher levels of Annexin A2. In 32D-IRS1 cells, IRS1 and Annexin A2 were both located in cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. We also found that IRS1 coprecipitated with Annexin A2, while IRS2 did not. Decreasing Annexin A2 levels reduced 32D-IRS1 cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. These results suggest IRS1 enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy in part through Annexin A2.

Abstract: Generating neural stem cells and neurons from reprogrammed human astrocytes is a potential strategy for neurological repair. Here we show dedifferentiation of human cortical astrocytes into the neural stem/progenitor phenotype to obtain progenitor and mature cells with a neural fate. Ectopic expression of the reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, or NANOG into astrocytes in specific cytokine/culture conditions activated the neural stem gene program and induced generation of cells expressing neural stem/precursor markers. Pure CD44+ mature astrocytes also exhibited this lineage commitment change and did not require passing through a pluripotent state. These astrocyte-derived neural stem cells gave rise to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and showed in vivo engraftment properties. ASCL1 expression further promoted neuronal phenotype acquisition in vitro and in vivo. Methylation analysis showed that epigenetic modifications underlie this process. The restoration of multipotency from human astrocytes has potential in cellular reprogramming of endogenous central nervous system cells in neurological disorders.

Abstract: Objective
Aquaglyceroporin 7 (AQP7) is required for efflux of glycerol from adipocytes. In this study, we aimed to analyze expression profiles of AQP7 in the different differentiation phases of adipocytes and to investigate the role of AQP7 in the insulin resistance of adipocytes. Methods: 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells were induced to be fully differentiated adipocytes and then insulin resistance was induced by Dexamethasone (DXM) or TNF-α. Adenovirus vector with over-expression AQP7 (Ad-AQP7) was constructed and transfected into adipocytes. The expression level of AQP7 and phosphorylated PKB (p-PKB) were measured. The glycerol released from adipocytes and glucose consuming rate were tested too. Results: AQP7 expression was gradually up-regulated along with the differentiation processing of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which was consistent with the expression level of p-PKB. Dexamethasone down-regulated the expression of AQP7, p-PKB and the glycerol content in adipocytes. Over-expression of AQP7 by transfecting Ad-AQP7 to insulin resistant adipocytes restored the phosphorylation of PKB and attenuated the glycerol secretion and glucose consuming rate of adipocytes. Conclusions: AQP7 is down-regulated in adipocytes with insulin resistance. The over-expression of AQP7 contributes to improve insulin resistance in adipocytes, which is potentially correlated with the increased phosphorylation of PKB.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology involves reprogramming somatic cells to a pluripotent state. The original technology used to produce these cells requires viral gene transduction and results in the permanent integration of exogenous genes into the genome. This can lead to the development of abnormalities in the derived iPS cells. Here, we report that non-viral transfection of a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon containing the coding sequences Oct3/4 (Pouf1), Sox-2, Klf-4 and c-Myc (OSKM) linked with 2A peptides, can reprogram mouse fibroblasts. We have established reprogrammed mouse cell lines from three different genetic backgrounds: (1) ICR—outbred, (2) C57BL/6—inbred and (3) F1-hybrid (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J), with parallel robust expression of all exogenous (Oct3/4, Sox-2, Klf-4, and c-Myc) and endogenous (e.g. Oct3/4 and Nanog) pluripotency genes. The iPS cell lines exhibited characteristics typical for undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cell lines: ES cell-like morphology, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) positivity and gene expression pattern (shown by reverse transcription PCR, and immunofluorescence of ES cell markers—e.g. Oct3/4, SSEA1, Nanog). Furthermore, cells were able to form embryoid bodies (EBs), to beat rhythmically, and express cardiac (assayed by immunofluorescence, e.g. cardiac Troponin T, desmin) and neuronal (assayed by immunofluorescence e.g. nestin, Tuj1) markers. The in vitro differentiation potential was found to be the highest in the ICR-derived iPS lines (ICR-iPS). Interestingly, the ICR-iPS lines had even higher differentiation potential than the ICR-ES cell lines: the rate of EBs forming rhythmically beating cardiomyocytes was 4% in ICR-ES and 79% in ICR-iPS cells, respectively. In vivo, the ICR and F1 hybrid iPS cells formed chimeras and one of the iPS cells from the F1 hybrid background transmitted to the germline. Our results suggest that iPS technology may be useful for generating pluripotent stem cells from genetic backgrounds of which good quality ES cell generation is difficult. These studies provide insights into viral-free iPS technology and may contribute towards defining future cell-based therapies, drug-screening methods and production of transgenic animals using genetically modified iPS cells.

Abstract: PArkin Co-Regulated Gene is a gene that shares a bidirectional promoter with the Parkinson's disease associated gene parkin. The encoded protein (PACRG) is found in Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic inclusions, the pathological hallmarks of parkinsonian disorders. To investigate the function and regulation of PACRG, cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG-132. As previously reported with parkin, inhibition of the proteasome resulted in the formation of aggresomes that contained endogenous PACRG. Increased levels of exogenous PACRG resulted in an increase in aggresome formation, and conferred significant resistance to aggresome disruption and cell death mediated by microtubule depolymerisation. In contrast, shRNA mediated knockdown of PACRG significantly reduced aggresome numbers. Elevated levels of PACRG also resulted in increased autophagy, as demonstrated by biochemical and quantitative analysis of autophagic vesicles, whereas lowered levels of PACRG resulted in reduced autophagy. These results suggest a role for PACRG in aggresome formation and establish a further link between the UPS and autophagy.

Abstract: Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a phosphoprotein expressed in a wide variety of cells. Cx43 and adenosine-triphosphate-sensitive K+channels [K+(ATP)] are part of same signaling pathway that regulates cell survival during stress and ischemia preconditioning. Molecular mechanism for their coordinated role in ischemia/hypoxia preconditioning is not well known. Using pull down, co-immunoprecipitation assays and co-localization studies we provide evidence, for the first time that Kir6.1, a K+(ATP) channel protein component, can interact with Cx43. Further we show that the interaction was phospho-specific such that Cx43 phosphorylated at serine 262 (S262) interacted with Kir6.1 in preference to the unphosphorylated form of Cx43. Introduction of phospho-deficient mutation at serine 262 (S262A) in Cx43 completely abolished the interaction. Our data provide an interesting lead about a possible partnership between Cx43 and Kir6.1, which will help in better understanding their role in ischemia/hypoxia preconditioning.

Abstract: Desmoglein 3 (Dsg3), a member of the desmoglein sub-family, serves as an adhesion molecule in desmosomes. Our previous study showed that overexpression of human Dsg3 in several epithelial lines induces formation of membrane protrusions, a phenotype suggestive of Rho GTPase activation. Here we examined the interaction between Dsg3 and actin in detail and showed that endogenous Dsg3 colocalises and interacts with actin, particularly the junctional actin in a Rac1-dependent manner. Ablation of Rac1 activity by dominant negative Rac1 mutant (N17Rac1) or the Rac1 specific inhibitor (NSC23766) directly disrupts the interaction between Dsg3 and actin. Assembly of the junctional actin at the cell borders is accompanied with enhanced levels of Dsg3, while inhibition of Dsg3 by RNAi results in profound changes in the organisation of actin cytoskeleton. In accordance, overexpression of Dsg3 results in a remarkable increase of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities and to a lesser extent, RhoA. The enhancements in Rho GTPases are accompanied by the pronounced actin-based membrane structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia, enhanced rate of actin turnover and cell polarisation. Together, our results reveal an important novel function for Dsg3 in promoting actin dynamics through regulating Rac1 and Cdc42 activation in epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
The life cycle of several viruses involves host or virally encoded small noncoding RNAs, which play important roles in posttranscriptional regulation. Small noncoding RNAs include microRNAs (miRNAs), which modulate the transcriptome, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are involved in pathogen defense in plants, worms, and insects. We show that insect and mammalian poxviruses induce the degradation of host miRNAs. The virally encoded poly(A) polymerase, which polyadenylates viral transcripts, also mediates 3′ polyadenylation of host miRNAs, resulting in their degradation by the host machinery. In contrast, siRNAs, which are protected by 2′O-methylation (2′OMe), were not targeted by poxviruses. These findings suggest that poxviruses may degrade host miRNAs to promote replication and that virus-mediated small RNA degradation likely contributed to 2′OMe evolution.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells differentiate into gastrula organizer cells that express typical markers and induce secondary axes when injected into frog embryos. Here, we report that these human organizer cells express DUXO (DUX of the Organizer), a novel member of the double-homeobox (DUX) family of transcription factors, a group of genes unique to placental mammals. Both of DUXO's homeodomains share high similarity with those of Siamois and Twin, the initial inducers of the amphibian gastrula organizer. DUXO overexpression in human embryoid bodies induces organizer related genes, whereas its knock down hampers formation of the organizer and its derivatives. Finally, we show that DUXO regulates GOOSECOID, the canonical organizer marker, in a direct manner, suggesting that DUXO is a major regulator of human organizer formation.

Abstract: Summary
The antiviral response is largely mediated by dendritic cells (DCs), including conventional (c) DCs that function as antigen-presenting cells, and plasmacytoid (p) DCs that produce type I interferons, making them an attractive target for viruses. We find that the Old World arenaviruses lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13 (LCMV Cl13) and Lassa virus bind pDCs to a greater extent than cDCs. Consistently, LCMV Cl13 targets pDCs early after in vivo infection of its natural murine host and establishes a productive and robust replication cycle. pDCs coproduce type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, with the former being induced in both infected and uninfected pDCs, demonstrating a dissociation from intrinsic virus replication. TLR7 globally mediates pDC responses, limits pDC viral load, and promotes rapid innate and adaptive immune cell activation. These early events likely help dictate the outcome of infections with arenaviruses and other DC-replicating viruses and shed light on potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Much evidence supports that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Herein, we studied the compensatory/adaptive mechanisms involved in 3-thiomethyl-5,6-(diphenyl)-1,2,4-triazine and 3-thiomethyl-5,6-(dichlorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazine neuroprotection. We found that these compounds could counteract H2O2-induced rupture of neurite outgrowth in differentiated PC12 cells. In addition, we found that pretreatment of cells with triazine derivatives could modulate the expression of heat shock proteins Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp32 in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. These compounds could also increase nuclear level of stress sensing transcription factor, NF-E2 related factor 2, which contributes to redox homeostasis and cell survival following stress. As a result, the elevated levels of glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione peroxidase-1, and glutathione, as well as superoxide dismutase and catalase, increased cellular antioxidant capacity. Studying the relation between structure and activity of these compounds will pave the way for exploiting preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for the management of oxidative stress-mediated disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Toxoplasma gondii proliferates within host cell vacuoles where the parasite relies on host carbon and nutrients for replication. To assess how T. gondii utilizes these resources, we mapped the carbon metabolism pathways in intracellular and egressed parasite stages. We determined that intracellular T. gondii stages actively catabolize host glucose via a canonical, oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a mitochondrial pathway in which organic molecules are broken down to generate energy. These stages also catabolize glutamine via the TCA cycle and an unanticipated γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt, which generates GABA and additional molecules that enter the TCA cycle. Chemically inhibiting the TCA cycle completely prevents intracellular parasite replication. Parasites lacking the GABA shunt exhibit attenuated growth and are unable to sustain motility under nutrient-limited conditions, suggesting that GABA functions as a short-term energy reserve. Thus, T. gondii tachyzoites have metabolic flexibility that likely allows the parasite to infect diverse cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic bacterial pathogens activate the cytosolic surveillance pathway (CSP) and induce innate immune responses, but how the host detects vacuolar pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis is poorly understood. We show that M. tuberculosis also initiates the CSP upon macrophage infection via limited perforation of the phagosome membrane mediated by the ESX-1 secretion system. Although the bacterium remains within the phagosome, this permeabilization results in phagosomal and cytoplasmic mixing and allows extracellular mycobacterial DNA to access host cytosolic receptors, thus blurring the distinction between “vacuolar” and “cytosolic” pathogens. Activation of cytosolic receptors induces signaling through the Sting/Tbk1/Irf3 axis, resulting in IFN-β production. Surprisingly, Irf3−/− mice, which cannot respond to cytosolic DNA, are resistant to long-term M. tuberculosis infection, suggesting that the CSP promotes M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, cytosolic sensing of mycobacterial DNA plays a key role in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis and likely contributes to the high type I IFN signature in tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of intestinal dietary fat absorption is critical to maintaining energy balance. While intestinal microbiota clearly impact the host’s energy balance, their role in intestinal absorption and extraintestinal metabolism of dietary fat is less clear. Using in vivo imaging of fluorescent fatty acid (FA) analogs delivered to gnotobiotic zebrafish hosts, we reveal that microbiota stimulate FA uptake and lipid droplet (LD) formation in the intestinal epithelium and liver. Microbiota increase epithelial LD number in a diet-dependent manner. The presence of food led to the intestinal enrichment of bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes. Diet-enriched Firmicutes and their products were sufficient to increase epithelial LD number, whereas LD size was increased by other bacterial types. Thus, different members of the intestinal microbiota promote FA absorption via distinct mechanisms. Diet-induced alterations in microbiota composition might influence fat absorption, providing mechanistic insight into how microbiota-diet interactions regulate host energy balance.

Abstract: The present study aimed to develop a method of quantification of heat shock protein transcript levels in the estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis. For that, the full-length cDNA of the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Ea-grp78) and the cytosolic 90-kDa heat shock protein (Ea-hsp90A) from this species have been cloned. These cDNA revealed, respectively, 2,370 and 2,299 bp with 1,971 and 2,124 bp open reading frames encoding 656 and 707 amino acids. Main features, sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis with other species were described. Then, the expression profiles were analysed using reverse transcription/real-time quantitative PCR method from copepods subjected to different thermic and osmotic stresses in laboratory, and from copepods directly sampled into the natural population of the Seine Estuary (France) along a salinity gradient. Thermic shock (7.5°C, 22.5°C and 30°C during 90 min) significantly induced increases of transcript quantities ranged between 1.7- and 19.7-fold the levels observed in control conditions (15°C). Hypo- and hyper-osmotic shocks (salinities of 1 and 30 during 90 min) caused a 2-fold induction of Ea-hsp90A transcript level in comparison to controls (salinity of 15) whereas no significant change was measured for Ea-grp78. On the other hand, similar expression profiles were observed for the two transcripts after 72 h of exposition to salinities of 1 and 25 with a significant 2-fold induction observed for the lower salinity. To finish, strong expression inductions of both Ea-grp78 and Ea-hsp90A genes were observed in field copepods sampled at low salinity during the campaigns of June 2009 and May 2010. These results tend to show that the low salinity and the increase of temperature seem to have a synergic effect on stress condition of copepods.

Abstract: Heterozygous mutations of the GFAP gene are responsible for Alexander disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by intracytoplasmic Rosenthal fibers (RFs) in dystrophic astrocytes. In vivo and in vitro models have shown co-localization of mutant GFAP proteins with the small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) HSP27 and alphaB-crystallin, ubiquitin and proteasome components. Results reported by several recent studies agree on ascribing an altered cytoskeletal pattern to mutant GFAP proteins, an effect which induces mutant proteins accumulation, leading to impaired proteasome function and autophagy induction. On the basis of the protective role shown by both these small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), and on the already well established neuroprotective effects of curcumin in several diseases, we have investigated the effects of this compound in an in vitro model of Alexander disease, consisting in U251-MG astrocytoma cells transiently transfected with a construct encoding for GFAP carrying the p.R239C mutation in frame with the reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP). In particular, depending on the dose used, we have observed that curcumin is able to induce both HSP27 and alphaB-crystallin, to reduce expression of both RNA and protein of endogenous GFAP, to induce autophagy and, finally, to rescue the filamentous organization of the GFAP mutant protein, thus suggesting a role of this spice in counteracting the pathogenic effects of GFAP mutations.

Abstract: In cycling cells cytosolic de novo synthesis of deoxynucleotides is the main source of precursors for mitochondrial (mt) DNA synthesis. The transfer of deoxynucleotides across the inner mt membrane requires protein carriers. PNC1, a SLC25 family member, exchanges pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates in liposomes and its downregulation decreases mtUTP concentration in cultured cells. By an isotope-flow protocol we confirmed transport of uridine nucleotides by PNC1 in intact cultured cells and investigated PNC1 involvement in the mt trafficking of thymidine phosphates. Key features of our approach were the manipulation of PNC1 expression by RNA interference or inducible overexpression, the employment of cells proficient or deficient for cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1) to distinguish the direction of flow of thymidine nucleotides across the mt membrane during short pulses with [3H]-thymidine, the determination of mtdTTP specific radioactivity to quantitate the rate of mtdTTP export to the cytoplasm. Downregulation of PNC1 in TK1− cells increased labeled dTTP in mitochondria due to a reduced rate of export. Overexpression of PNC1 in TK1+ cells increased mtdTTP pool size and radioactivity, suggesting an involvement in the import of thymidine phosphates. Thus PNC1 is a component of the network regulating the mtdTTP pool in human cells.

Abstract: The transmembrane protein Cbp/PAG (Csk binding protein/phospho-protein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains) has a negative regulatory role in T cell activation as an adapter for C-terminal Src kinase, Csk. In T cells, membrane docking of Csk is promoted by binding to FynT-phosphorylated Cbp/PAG (pTyr317) to allow targeting of substrates residing in lipid rafts. Here, we investigate a potential parallel position for Cbp/PAG and the Src kinase Lyn in early B cell receptor signaling. Using normal and transformed B cells, we have compared signal profiles of BCR-triggered responses created by phospho-specific flow cytometry. In human normal B cells, our data show that reduced Cbp/PAG levels leads to enhanced and prolonged activation of proximal signaling mediators, while over-expression of the adapter in normal, EBV-transformed cells results in reduced calcium flux. Taken together, our findings support a negative regulatory function for Cbp/PAG in proximal BCR signaling in these cells.

Abstract: We determined whether cells that are induced to undergo anoikis by matrix detachment can initiate apoptosis in healthy cells following electroporation-induced fusion. Separate populations of MDCK cells undergoing anoikis and stained with FITC-annexin or viable MDCK cells that were labeled with spectrally discrete fluorescent beads were electroporated. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for enumeration of viable cells with beads, apoptotic cells or fused cells. Electroporation promoted a 49-fold increase of the percentage of viable cells that had fused with apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cell-viable cell fusions were 8-fold more likely to not attach to cell culture plastic and 2.3-fold less likely to proliferate after 24hr incubation than viable cell fusion controls. These data demonstrate that apoptotic signals can be transferred between cells by electrofusion, possibly suggesting a novel investigative approach for optimizing targeted cell deletion in cancer treatment.

Abstract: Heterodimerization and cross-talk between nuclear hormone receptors often occurs. For example, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) physically binds to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and inhibits its transcriptional activity. The interaction between PPARγ and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) however, is unknown. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking PPARγ and VDR signaling, and for the first time we show that PPARγ physically associates with VDR in human breast cancer cells. We found that overexpression of PPARγ decreased 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) mediated transcriptional activity of the vitamin D target gene, CYP24A1, by 49% and the activity of VDRE-luc, a vitamin D responsive reporter, by 75% in T47D human breast cancer cells. Deletion mutation experiments illustrated that helices 1 and 4 of PPARγ's hinge and ligand binding domains, respectively, governed this suppressive function. Additionally, abrogation of PPARγ's AF2 domain attenuated its repressive action on 1,25D3 transactivation, indicating that this domain is integral in inhibiting VDR signaling. PPARγ was also found to compete with VDR for their binding partner retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα). Overexpression of RXRα blocked PPARγ's suppressive effect on 1,25D3 action, enhancing VDR signaling. In conclusion, these observations uncover molecular mechanisms connecting the PPARγ and VDR pathways.

Abstract: Current cancer therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation and hyperthermic therapy induce acute proteotoxic stress in tumour cells. A major challenge to cancer therapeutic efficacy is the recurrence of therapy-resistant tumours and how to overcome their emergence. The current study examines the concept that tumour cell exposure to acute proteotoxic stress results in the acquisition of a more advanced and aggressive cancer cell phenotype. Specifically, we determined whether heat stress resulted in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and/or the enhancement of cell migration, components of an advanced and therapeutically resistant cancer phenotype. We identified that heat stress enhanced cell migration in both the lung A549, and breast MDA-MB-468 human adenocarcinoma cell lines, with A549 cells also undergoing a partial EMT. Moreover, in an in vivo model of thermally ablated liver metastases of the mouse colorectal MoCR cell line, immunohistological analysis of classical EMT markers demonstrated a shift to a more mesenchymal phenotype in the surviving tumour fraction, further demonstrating that thermal stress can induce epithelial plasticity. To identify a mechanism by which thermal stress modulates epithelial plasticity, we examined whether the major transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), was a required component. Knockdown of HSF1 in the A549 model did not prevent the associated morphological changes or enhanced migratory profile of heat stressed cells. Therefore, this study provides evidence that heat stress significantly impacts upon cancer cell epithelial plasticity and the migratory phenotype independent of HSF1. These findings further our understanding of novel biological downstream effects of heat stress and their potential independence from the classical heat shock pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic bacterial infection is characterized by a robust whole-organism inflammatory response. Analysis of the immune response to infection involves technologies that typically focus on single organ systems and lack spatial information. Additionally, the analysis of individual inflammatory proteins requires antibodies specific to the protein of interest, limiting the panel of proteins that can be analyzed. Herein we describe the application of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) to mice systemically infected with Staphylococcus aureus to identify inflammatory protein masses that respond to infection throughout an entire infected animal. Integrating the resolution afforded by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the sensitivity of MALDI IMS provides three-dimensional spatially resolved information regarding the distribution of innate immune proteins during systemic infection, allowing comparisons to in vivo structural information and soft-tissue contrast via MRI. Thus, integrating MALDI IMS with MRI provides a systems-biology approach to study inflammation during infection.

Abstract: Chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF plays important roles in many cellular processes including transcription, proliferation, differentiation and DNA repair. In this report, we investigated the role of SWI/SNF catalytic subunits Brg1 and Brm in the cellular response to cisplatin in lung cancer and head/neck cancer cells. Stable knockdown of Brg1 and Brm enhanced cellular sensitivity to cisplatin. Repair kinetics of cisplatin DNA adducts revealed that downregulation of Brg1 and Brm impeded the repair of both intrastrand adducts and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Cisplatin ICL-induced DNA double strand break repair was also decreased in Brg1 and Brm depleted cells. Altered checkpoint activation with enhanced apoptosis as well as impaired chromatin relaxation was observed in Brg1 and Brm deficient cells. Downregulation of Brg1 and Brm did not affect the recruitment of DNA damage recognition factor XPC to cisplatin DNA lesions, but affected ERCC1 recruitment, which is involved in the later stages of DNA repair. Based on these results, we propose that SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex modulates cisplatin cytotoxicity by facilitating efficient repair of the cisplatin DNA lesions.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue viruses (DVs) are responsible for the most medically relevant arboviral diseases. However, the molecular interactions mediating DV entry are poorly understood. We determined that TIM and TAM proteins, two receptor families that mediate the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)-dependent phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells, serve as DV entry factors. Cells poorly susceptible to DV are robustly infected after ectopic expression of TIM or TAM receptors. Conversely, DV infection of susceptible cells is inhibited by anti-TIM or anti-TAM antibodies or knockdown of TIM and TAM expression. TIM receptors facilitate DV entry by directly interacting with virion-associated PtdSer. TAM-mediated infection relies on indirect DV recognition, in which the TAM ligand Gas6 acts as a bridging molecule by binding to PtdSer within the virion. This dual mode of virus recognition by TIM and TAM receptors reveals how DVs usurp the apoptotic cell clearance pathway for infectious entry.

Abstract: Summary
The current standard of treatment against tuberculosis consists of a cocktail of first-line drugs, including isoniazid and pyrazinamide. Although these drugs are known to be bactericidal, contribution of host cell responses in the context of antimycobacterial chemotherapy, if any, remains unknown. We demonstrate that isoniazid and pyrazinamide promote autophagy activation and phagosomal maturation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected host cells. Treatment of Mtb-infected macrophages with isoniazid or pyrazinamide caused significant activation of cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and autophagy, which was triggered by bacterial hydroxyl radical generation. Mycobacterium marinum-infected autophagy-defective, atg7 mutant Drosophila exhibited decreased survival rates, which could not be rescued by antimycobacterial treatment, indicating that autophagy is required for effective antimycobacterial drug action in vivo. Moreover, activation of autophagy by antibiotic treatment dampened Mtb-induced proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Together, these findings underscore the importance of host autophagy in orchestrating successful antimicrobial responses to mycobacteria during chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) serves as a primary plant defense response against microbial pathogens, with MEKK1, MKK1/MKK2, and MPK4 functioning as a MAP kinase cascade downstream of PAMP receptors. Plant Resistance (R) proteins sense specific pathogen effectors to initiate a second defense mechanism, termed effector-triggered immunity (ETI). In a screen for suppressors of the mkk1 mkk2 autoimmune phenotype, we identify the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) protein SUMM2 and find that the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade negatively regulates SUMM2-mediated immunity. Further, the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade positively regulates basal defense targeted by the Pseudomonas syringae pathogenic effector HopAI1, which inhibits MPK4 kinase activity. Inactivation of MPK4 by HopAI1 results in activation of SUMM2-mediated defense responses. Our data suggest that SUMM2 is an R protein that becomes active when the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade is disrupted by pathogens, supporting the hypothesis that R proteins evolved to protect plants when microbial effectors suppress basal resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is associated with multiple human tumors, persists as a minichromosome in the nucleus of B lymphocytes and induces malignancies through incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we present a large-scale functional genomic analysis of EBV. Our experimentally generated nucleosome positioning maps and viral protein binding data were integrated with over 700 publicly available high-throughput sequencing data sets for human lymphoblastoid cell lines mapped to the EBV genome. We found that viral lytic genes are coexpressed with cellular cancer-associated pathways, suggesting that the lytic cycle may play an unexpected role in virus-mediated oncogenesis. Host regulators of viral oncogene expression and chromosome structure were identified and validated, revealing a role for the B cell-specific protein Pax5 in viral gene regulation and the cohesin complex in regulating higher order chromatin structure. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of latent viral persistence in oncogenesis and establish a valuable viral genomics resource for future exploration.

Abstract: Oxysterol binding protein related protein 1S (ORP1S) is a member of a family of sterol transport proteins. Here we present evidence that ORP1S translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to sterol binding. The sterols that best promote nuclear import of ORP1S also activate the liver X receptor (LXR) transcription factors and we show that ORP1S binds to LXRs, promotes binding of LXRs to LXR response elements (LXREs) and specifically enhances LXR-dependent transcription via the ME.1 and ME.2 enhancer elements of the apoE gene. We propose that ORP1S is a cytoplasmic sterol sensor, which transports sterols to the nucleus and promotes LXR-dependent gene transcription through select enhancer elements.

Expression and function of the SDF-1 chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 during mouse limb muscle development and regeneration,

Abstract: The chemokine, SDF-1/CXCL12, and its receptor, CXCR4, have been implied to play major roles during limb myogenesis. This concept was recently challenged by the identification of CXCR7 as an alternative SDF-1 receptor, which can either act as a scavenger receptor, a modulator of CXCR4, or an active chemokine receptor. We have now re-examined this issue by determining whether SDF-1 would signal to C2C12 myoblasts and subsequently influence their differentiation via CXCR4 and/or CXCR7. In addition, we have analyzed CXCR7, CXCR4, and SDF-1 expression in developing and injured mouse limb muscles. We demonstrate that in undifferentiated C2C12 cells, SDF-1-dependent cell signaling and resulting inhibitory effects on myogenic differentiation are entirely mediated by CXCR4. We further demonstrate that CXCR7 expression increases in differentiating C2C12 cells, which in turn abrogates CXCR4 signaling. Moreover, consistent with the view that CXCR4 and CXCR7 control limb myogenesis in vivo by similar mechanisms, we found that CXCR4 expression is the highest in late embryonic hindlimb muscles and drops shortly after birth when secondary muscle growth terminates. Vice versa, CXCR7 expression increased perinatally and persisted into adult life. Finally, underscoring the role of the SDF-1 system in muscle regeneration, we observed that SDF-1 is continuously expressed by endomysial cells of postnatal and adult muscle fibers. Analysis of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice additionally revealed that muscle regeneration is associated with muscular re-expression of CXCR4. The apparent tight control of limb muscle development and regeneration by CXCR4 and CXCR7 points to these chemokine receptors as promising therapeutic targets for certain muscle disorders.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is one of the major MMPs that can degrade extracellular matrix. Besides normal physiological functions, MMP-9 is involved in metastasis and tumor angiogenesis. Although several inhibitors of MMP-9 have been identified, in vivo regulators of MMP-9 activation are unknown. In the present study we intended to investigate novel therapeutic target protein(s) that regulate MMP-9 activation and/or secretion. We have identified protein disulfide isomerase as a novel upstream regulator of MMP-9. Mass spectrometric analysis of post-translational modification in MMP-9 confirmed six disulfide bonds in the catalytic domain and one disulfide bond in the hemopexin domain of MMP-9. Establishment of cells that overexpressed wild-type and mutant forms of MMP-9 revealed that ‘cysteine-switch’ and disulfide bonds within the catalytic domain are necessary for the secretion and intracellular trafficking of MMP-9. However, the disulfide bond of the hemopexin domain and other cysteines have no significant role in secretion. These insights into the secretion of MMP-9 constitute the basis for the development of potential drugs against metastasis.

Abstract: COX-2 and iNOS are two major inflammatory mediators implicated in colorectal inflammation and cancer. Previously, the role of colorectal fibroblasts involved in regulation of COX-2 and iNOS expression was largely ignored. In addition, the combined interaction of COX-2 and iNOS signalings and their significance in the progression of colorectal inflammation and cancer within the fibroblasts have received little investigation. To address those issues, we investigated the role of colonic fibroblasts in the regulation of COX-2 and iNOS gene expression, and explored possible mechanisms of interaction between COX-2 and iNOS signalings using a colonic CCD-18Co fibroblast line and LPS, a potential stimulator of COX-2 and iNOS. Our results clearly demonstrated that LPS activated COX-2 gene expression and enhanced PGE2 production, stimulated iNOS gene expression and promoted NO production in the fibroblasts. Interestingly, activation of COX-2 signaling by LPS was not involved in activation of iNOS signaling, while activation of iNOS signaling by LPS contributed in part to activation of COX-2 signaling. Further analysis indicated that PKC plays a major role in the activation and interaction of COX-2 and iNOS signalings induced by LPS in the fibroblasts.

Abstract: No systemic therapy is effective against pancreatic cancer (PC). Pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSC) are hypothesized to account for therapeutic resistance. Several PCSC subpopulations were reported, each characterized by different markers. To be able to target PCSC, we sought to better define this putative heterogeneity. Therefore, we tested most of the known putative PCSC markers in established and fresh tumor cell lines. CD20, CD24, CD44, CD133, CD184 (CXCR4), CD326 (EpCam, ESA), Sox-2, OCT 3/4, and the side-population (SP) were tested in five PC cell lines, and the effects of confluency, hypoxia, radiation, and gemcitabine on the SP. The testing phase suggested several putative PCSC populations that were further tested and validated for their tumor-initiating capacity against known PCSC in 3 established and 1 fresh PC cell lines. Cell surface and intracellular markers showed significant variability among cell lines. SP was the only common marker in all cell lines and consistently less than 1%. SP response to confluence, hypoxia, radiation, and gemcitabine was inconsistent between cell lines. The initial testing phase suggested that SP/CD44-CD24-CD326+ cells might be a novel PCSC subpopulation. Tumor initiation capacity tests in nude mice confirmed their increased tumorigenicity over previously reported PCSC. Our data better define the heterogeneity of reported PCSC in cell lines tested in this study. We propose that prior to targeting PC via PCSC, one will need to gain more insight into this heterogeneity. Finally, we show that SP/CD44-CD24-CD326+ cells are a novel subpopulation of pancreatic cancer tumor initiating cells. Further mechanistic studies may lead to better targeting of PC via targeting this novel PCSC.

Abstract: The glomerular capillary wall, composed of endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane and the podocytes, is continually subjected to hemodynamic force arising from tractional stress due to blood pressure and shear stress due to blood flow. Exposure of glomeruli to abnormal hemodynamic force such as hyperfiltration is associated with glomerular injury and progressive renal disease, and the conversion of mechanical stimuli to chemical signals in the regulation of the process is poorly understood in podocytes. By examining DNA fragmentation, apoptotic nuclear changes and cytochrome c release, we found that shear stress induced cell apoptosis in cultured podocytes. Meanwhile, podocytes exposed to shear stress also stimulated c-Src phosphorylation, phospholipase D (PLD) activation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Using the antibodies against c-Src, PLD1, and PLD2 to perform reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations and in vitro PLD activity assay, our data indicated that c-Src interacted with and activated PLD1 but not PLD2. The inhibition of shear stress-induced c-Src phosphorylation by PP2 (a specific inhibitor of c-Src kinase) resulted in reduced PLD activity. Phosphatidic acid, produced by shear stress-induced PLD activation, stimulated mTOR signaling, and caused podocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy, which targets cellular constituents for degradation, is normally inhibited in metabolically replete cells by the metabolic checkpoint kinase mTOR. Although autophagic degradation of invasive bacteria has emerged as a critical host defense mechanism, the signals that induce autophagy upon bacterial infection remain unclear. We find that infection of epithelial cells with Shigella and Salmonella triggers acute intracellular amino acid (AA) starvation due to host membrane damage. Pathogen-induced AA starvation caused downregulation of mTOR activity, resulting in the induction of autophagy. In Salmonella-infected cells, membrane integrity and cytosolic AA levels rapidly normalized, favoring mTOR reactivation at the surface of the Salmonella-containing vacuole and bacterial escape from autophagy. In addition, bacteria-induced AA starvation activated the GCN2 kinase, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, and the transcription factor ATF3-dependent integrated stress response and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, AA starvation induced by bacterial pathogens is sensed by the host to trigger protective innate immune and stress responses.

Abstract: Summary
Asexual stage Plasmodium falciparum replicates and undergoes a tightly regulated developmental process in human erythrocytes. One mechanism involved in the regulation of this process is posttranslational modification (PTM) of parasite proteins. Palmitoylation is a PTM in which cysteine residues undergo a reversible lipid modification, which can regulate target proteins in diverse ways. Using complementary palmitoyl protein purification approaches and quantitative mass spectrometry, we examined protein palmitoylation in asexual-stage P. falciparum parasites and identified over 400 palmitoylated proteins, including those involved in cytoadherence, drug resistance, signaling, development, and invasion. Consistent with the prevalence of palmitoylated proteins, palmitoylation is essential for P. falciparum asexual development and influences erythrocyte invasion by directly regulating the stability of components of the actin-myosin invasion motor. Furthermore, P. falciparum uses palmitoylation in diverse ways, stably modifying some proteins while dynamically palmitoylating others. Palmitoylation therefore plays a central role in regulating P. falciparum blood stage development.

Abstract: Heat-shock proteins (hsps) have important roles in the development of the eye lens. We previously demonstrated that knockdown of hsp70 gene expression using morpholino antisense technology resulted in an altered lens phenotype in zebrafish embryos. A less severe phenotype was seen with knockdown of heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), suggesting that, while it likely plays a role in hsp70 regulation during lens formation, other regulatory factors are also involved. Heat-shock factor 4 plays an important role in mammalian lens development, and an expressed sequence tag encoding zebrafish HSF4 has been identified. The deduced amino acid sequence shares structural similarities with mammalian HSF4 including the lack of an HR-C domain. However, the HR-C domain is absent due to a severe C-terminal truncation within zebrafish HSF4 (zHSF4) relative to the mammalian protein. Surprisingly, the amino acid composition of the zHSF4 DNA binding domain shares a greater degree of identity with HSF1 proteins than it does with mammalian HSF4 proteins. Consistent with this, the binding affinity of in vitro synthesized zHSF4 for discontinuous heat-shock response element sequences is more limited, similar to what has been previously observed for HSF1 proteins. Hsf4 mRNA is expressed in zebrafish adult eye tissue but is only observed in developing embryonic tissue at 60 h post-fertilization or later. This, together with the lack of an observable phenotype following morpholino-based antisense knockdown of hsf4, suggests that zHSF4 is unlikely to play a role in regulating early embryonic lens development.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexan parasites have an assortment of unique apical secretory organelles (rhoptries and micronemes), which have crucial functions in host infection. Here, we show that a Toxoplasma gondii sortilin-like receptor (TgSORTLR) is required for the subcellular localization and formation of apical secretory organelles. TgSORTLR is a transmembrane protein that resides within Golgi-endosomal related compartments. The lumenal domain specifically interacts with rhoptry and microneme proteins, while the cytoplasmic tail of TgSORTLR recruits cytosolic sorting machinery involved in anterograde and retrograde protein transport. Ectopic expression of the N-terminal TgSORTLR lumenal domain results in dominant negative effects with the mislocalization of both endogenous TgSORTLR as well as rhoptry and microneme proteins. Conditional ablation of TgSORTLR disrupts rhoptry and microneme biogenesis, inhibits parasite motility, and blocks both invasion into and egress from host cells. Thus, the sortilin-like receptor is essential for protein trafficking and the biogenesis of key secretory organelles in Toxoplasma.

Abstract: Summary
Virus infection-induced global protein synthesis suppression is linked to assembly of stress granules (SGs), cytosolic aggregates of stalled translation preinitiation complexes. To study long-term stress responses, we developed an imaging approach for extended observation and analysis of SG dynamics during persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In combination with type 1 interferon, HCV infection induces highly dynamic assembly/disassembly of cytoplasmic SGs, concomitant with phases of active and stalled translation, delayed cell division, and prolonged cell survival. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), independent of viral replication, is sufficient to trigger these oscillations. Translation initiation factor eIF2α phosphorylation by protein kinase R mediates SG formation and translation arrest. This is antagonized by the upregulation of GADD34, the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 dephosphorylating eIF2α. Stress response oscillation is a general mechanism to prevent long-lasting translation repression and a conserved host cell reaction to multiple RNA viruses, which HCV may exploit to establish persistence.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are typically the first responders in host defense against invading pathogens, which they destroy by both oxidative and nonoxidative mechanisms. However, despite a longstanding recognition of neutrophil presence at disease sites in tuberculosis, their role in defense against mycobacteria is unclear. Here we exploit the genetic tractability and optical transparency of zebrafish to monitor neutrophil behavior and its consequences during infection with Mycobacterium marinum, a natural fish pathogen. In contrast to macrophages, neutrophils do not interact with mycobacteria at initial infection sites. Neutrophils are subsequently recruited to the nascent granuloma in response to signals from dying infected macrophages within the granuloma, which they phagocytose. Some neutrophils then rapidly kill the internalized mycobacteria through NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanisms. Our results provide a mechanistic link to the observed patterns of neutrophils in human tuberculous granulomas and the susceptibility of humans with chronic granulomatous disease to mycobacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play key roles in mucosal defense, yet how they are induced and the consequences for pathogens are unclear. We report that ROS generated by epithelial NADPH oxidases (Nox1/Duox2) during Campylobacter jejuni infection impair bacterial capsule formation and virulence by altering bacterial signal transduction. Upon C. jejuni invasion, ROS released from the intestinal mucosa inhibit the bacterial phosphotyrosine network that is regulated by the outer-membrane tyrosine kinase Cjtk (Cj1170/OMP50). ROS-mediated Cjtk inactivation results in an overall decrease in the phosphorylation of C. jejuni outer-membrane/periplasmic proteins, including UDP-GlcNAc/Glc 4-epimerase (Gne), an enzyme required for N-glycosylation and capsule formation. Cjtk positively regulates Gne by phosphorylating an active site tyrosine, while loss of Cjtk or ROS treatment inhibits Gne activity, causing altered polysaccharide synthesis. Thus, epithelial NADPH oxidases are an early antibacterial defense system in the intestinal mucosa that modifies virulence by disrupting bacterial signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Gut epithelial cells contact both commensal and pathogenic bacteria, and proper responses to these bacteria require a balance of positive and negative regulatory signals. In the Drosophila intestine, peptidoglycan-recognition proteins (PGRPs), including PGRP-LE, play central roles in bacterial recognition and activation of immune responses, including induction of the IMD-NF-κB pathway. We show that bacteria recognition is regionalized in the Drosophila gut with various functional regions requiring different PGRPs. Specifically, peptidoglycan recognition by PGRP-LE in the gut induces NF-κB-dependent responses to infectious bacteria but also immune tolerance to microbiota through upregulation of pirk and PGRP-LB, which negatively regulate IMD pathway activation. Loss of PGRP-LE-mediated detection of bacteria in the gut results in systemic immune activation, which can be rescued by overexpressing PGRP-LB in the gut. Together these data indicate that PGRP-LE functions as a master gut bacterial sensor that induces balanced responses to infectious bacteria and tolerance to microbiota.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral defense, but how they orchestrate immune cell function is incompletely understood. We determined that IFNs produced during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection differentially affect dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells. IFNs induce cell-intrinsic responses in DCs, activating antiproliferative, antiviral, and lymphocyte-activating gene networks, consistent with high activity of the transcription factor STAT1 in these cells. By comparison, NK cells exhibit lower STAT1 expression and reduced IFN responsiveness. Rather, IFNs indirectly affect NK cells by inducing IL-15, which activates the transcription factor E2F and stimulates genes promoting cell expansion. IFN cell-intrinsic responses are necessary in DCs, but not NK cells, for MCMV resistance. Thus, sensitivity to IFN-induced cytokines and differences in IFN receptor signaling program immune cells to mount distinct responses that promote viral control.

Abstract: It has long been known that core body temperature declines with age, with temperatures of 35.5°C or below common in the elderly. However, the effects of temperature reduction on bone cell function and skeletal homeostasis have been little studied. We investigated the effects of mild hypothermia (35.5°C) and severe hypothermia (34°C) on bone-forming osteoblasts, and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Formation of ‘trabecular’ bone structures by rat calvarial osteoblasts was reduced by 75% at 35.5°C and by 95% at 34°C after 14–16 days culture, compared to 37°C. In addition to reductions in osteoblast cell number, expression of mRNAs for Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and type I collagen were also down-regulated in hypothermia. In contrast, formation of osteoclasts in mononuclear cell cultures derived from mouse marrow, showed a 1.5 to 2-fold stimulation in hypothermia; resorption pit formation was similarly increased. Taken together, these data show that hypothermia exerts reciprocal effects on bone cell function by retarding osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, whilst increasing osteoclastogenesis and thus resorption. These results suggest the possibility that hypothermia in the elderly could potentially have a direct, negative impact on bone metabolism.

Abstract: Until recently, the immune system was seen solely as a defense system with its primary task being the elimination of unwanted microbial invaders. Currently, however, the functional significance of the immune system has obtained a much wider perspective, to include among others the maintenance and restoration of homeostasis following tissue damage. In this latter aspect, there is a growing interest in the identification of molecules involved, such as the so-called danger or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), also called alarmins. Since heat shock proteins are archetypical molecules produced under stressful conditions, such as tissue damage or inflammation, they are frequently mentioned as prime examples of DAMPs (Bianchi, J Leukoc Biol 81:1–5, 2007; Kono and Rock, Nat Rev Immunol 8:279–289, 2008; Martin-Murphy et al., Toxicol Lett 192:387–394, 2010). See for instance also a recent review (Chen and Nunez, Science 298:1395–1401, 2010). Contrary to this description, we recently presented some of the arguments against a role of heat shock protein as DAMPs (Broere et al., Nat Rev Immunol 11:565-c1, 2011). With this perspective and reflection article, we hope to elaborate on this debate and provide additional thoughts to further ignite this discussion on this critical and evolving issue.

Abstract: ORP8 is an oxysterol/cholesterol binding protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope, and is abundantly expressed in the macrophage. We created and characterized mouse RAW264.7 macrophages with ORP8 stably silenced using shRNA lentiviruses. A microarray transcriptome and gene ontology pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in several nuclear pathways and ones associated with centrosome and microtubule organization. ORP8 knockdown resulted in increased expression and altered subcellular distribution of an interaction partner of ORP8, nucleoporin NUP62, with an intranuclear localization aspect and association with cytoplasmic vesicular structures and lamellipodial edges of the cells. Moreover, ORP8 silenced cells displayed enhanced migration, and a more pronounced microtubule cytoskeleton than controls expressing a non-targeting shRNA. ORP8 was shown to compete with Exo70 for interaction with NUP62, and NUP62 knockdown abolished the migration enhancement of ORP8-silenced cells, suggesting that the endogenous ORP8 suppresses migration via binding to NUP62. As a conclusion, the present study reveals new, unexpected aspects of ORP8 function in macrophages not directly involving lipid metabolism, but rather associated with nuclear functions, microtubule organization, and migration capacity.

Abstract: Fibulins are evolutionarily conserved extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that assemble in elastic fibers and basement membranes. Caenorhabditis elegans has a single fibulin gene that produces orthologs of vertebrate fibulin-1 C and D splice forms. In a structure-function analysis of fibulin-1 domains, a series of deletion constructs show that EGF repeats 4 and 5 are required for the hemicentin-dependent assembly and function of fibulin-1D in native locations. In contrast, constructs missing the second EGF repeat of fibulin-1D (EGF2D) assemble in ectopic locations in a hemicentin dependent manner. Constructs that contain EGF2D are cleaved into two fragments, but constructs with EGF2D missing are not, suggesting that a protease binds and/or cleaves fibulin-1D at a site that is likely within EGF2D. Together, the data suggests that EGF repeats 4 and 5 promote interaction with hemicentin while a region within EGF2D suppresses ectopic interactions with hemicentin and this suppression may be protease dependent.

Abstract: Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (Rock2) belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases which are actived via interaction with Rho GTPases. Recently, overexpression of Rock2 has been demonstrated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the potential role of Rock2 in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Cdc25A acts as a key checkpoint during the G1/S phase and has also been found to be overexpressed in HCC. Here, we report that Rock2 regulates cell cycle progression via ubiquitination of Cdc25A in HCC. In HCC tissues, Rock2 and Cdc25A were aberrantly upregulated and revealed a significantly positive correlation. Knockdown of Rock2 inhibited HCC cell growth and promoted cell-cycle arrest at the G1/S phase via regulation of Cdc25A. When cells were exposed to DNA damage, Rock2 increased cell survival by regulating Cdc25A. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses indicated that Rock2 regulated Cdc25A via direct binding. Furthermore, knockdown of Rock2 activated Cdc25A ubiquitination and promoted its degradation. Our results defined a role for Rock2 in modulation of Cdc25A ubiquitination, indicating a novel mechanism of Cdc25A regulation and a potential function for Rock2 in the development of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon (IFN-I) promotes antiviral CD8+T cell responses, but the contribution of different IFN-I sources and signaling pathways are ill defined. While plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce IFN-I upon TLR stimulation, IFN-I is induced in most cells by helicases like MDA5. Using acute and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection models, we determined that pDCs transiently produce IFN-I that minimally impacts CD8+T cell responses and viral persistence. Rather, MDA5 is the key sensor that induces IFN-I required for CD8+T cell responses. In the absence of MDA5, CD8+T cell responses to acute infection rely on CD4+T cell help, and loss of both CD4+T cells and MDA5 results in CD8+T cell exhaustion and persistent infection. Chronic LCMV infection rapidly attenuates IFN-I responses, but early administration of exogenous IFN-I rescues CD8+T cells, promoting viral clearance. Thus, effective antiviral CD8+T cell responses depend on the timing and magnitude of IFN-I production.

Abstract: Generation of splice variants in the RON receptor tyrosine kinase facilitates the invasive phenotype of colorectal cancers. Here, we report a new splice variant of RON in the human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116. This variant is encoded by a transcript differing from the full-length RON mRNA by an in-frame deletion of 106 amino acids in the extracellular domain of RON β-chain. The deleted transcript originates by an alternative deletion of exon 2 and exon 3. The molecular weight of this variant is 160kDa. Thus, we named this variant RONΔ160E2E3. This variant is a single-chain protein and expressed in the intracellular compartment. We found that RONΔ160E2E3 had no tyrosine phosphorylation ability, but it has constitutively activated Akt activity in transfected HEK293 epithelial cells. The expression of this variant in HEK293 cells resulted in an increased migratory activity in vitro mediated through the PI-3K/Akt pathway. Our data describes a new splice variant of RON and suggests a novel role for the RON receptor in the progression of metastasis in colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Neurokinin 1 (NK1) encodes full-length (NK1-FL) and truncated (NK1-Tr) receptors, with distinct 3′ UTR. NK1-Tr exerts oncogenic functions and is increased in breast cancer (BC). Enhanced transcription of NK1 resulted in higher level of NK1-Tr. The 3′ UTR of these two transcripts are distinct with NK1-Tr terminating at a premature stop codon. NK1-Tr mRNA gained an advantage over NK1-FL with regards to translation. This is due to the ability of miR519B to interact with sequences within the 3′ UTR of NK1-FL, but not NK1-Tr since the corresponding region is omitted. MiR519b suppressed the translation of NK1-FL in T47D and MDA-MB-231 resulting in increased NK1-Tr protein. Cytokines can induce the transcription of NK1. However, our studies indicated that translation appeared to be independent of cytokine production by the BC cells (BCCs). This suggested that transcription and translation of NK1 might be independent. The findings were validated in vivo. MiR-519b suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-231 in 7/10 nude BALB/c. In total, increased NK1-Tr in BCCs is due to enhanced transcription and suppressed translation of NK1-FL by miR-519b to reduced tumor growth. In summary, we report on miRNA as a method to further regulate the expression of a spiced variant to promote oncogenesis. In addition, the findings have implications for therapy with NK1 antagonists. The oncogenic effect of NK1-Tr must be considered to improve the efficacy of current drugs to NK1.

Abstract: Summary
TLR7 is an innate signaling receptor that recognizes single-stranded viral RNA and is activated by viruses that cause persistent infections. We show that TLR7 signaling dictates either clearance or establishment of life-long chronic infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) Cl 13 but does not affect clearance of the acute LCMV Armstrong 53b strain. TLR7−/− mice infected with LCMV Cl 13 remained viremic throughout life from defects in the adaptive antiviral immune response—notably, diminished T cell function, exacerbated T cell exhaustion, decreased plasma cell maturation, and negligible antiviral antibody production. Adoptive transfer of TLR7+/+ LCMV immune memory cells that enhanced clearance of persistent LCMV Cl 13 infection in TLR7+/+ mice failed to purge LCMV Cl 13 infection in TLR7−/− mice, demonstrating that a TLR7-deficient environment renders antiviral responses ineffective. Therefore, methods that promote TLR7 signaling are promising treatment strategies for chronic viral infections.

Abstract: Summary
Host antibacterial responses include mechanisms that kill bacteria, but also those that protect or tolerize the host to potentially damaging antibacterial effects. We determined that Chitinase 3-like-1 (Chi3l1), a conserved prototypic chitinase-like protein, is induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae and plays central roles in promoting bacterial clearance and mediating host tolerance. S. pneumoniae-infected Chi3l1 null mice exhibit exaggerated lung injury, inflammation and hemorrhage, more frequent bacterial dissemination, decreased bacterial clearance, and enhanced mortality compared to controls. Chi3l1 augments macrophage bacterial killing by inhibiting caspase-1-dependent macrophage pyroptosis and augments host tolerance by controlling inflammasome activation, ATP accumulation, expression of ATP receptor P2X7R, and production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and type 1, type 2, and type 17 cytokines. These data demonstrate that Chi3l1 is induced during infection, where it promotes bacterial clearance while simultaneously augmenting host tolerance, and that these roles likely contributed to the retention of Chi3l1 over species and evolutionary time.

Abstract: Extracellular heat-shock protein 72 (eHsp72) expression during exercise-heat stress is suggested to increase with the level of hyperthermia attained, independent of the rate of heat storage. This study examined the influence of exercise at various intensities to elucidate this relationship, and investigated the association between eHsp72 and eHsp27. Sixteen male subjects cycled to exhaustion at 60% and 75% of maximal oxygen uptake in hot conditions (40°C, 50% RH). Core temperature, heart rate, oxidative stress, and blood lactate and glucose levels were measured to determine the predictor variables associated with eHsp expression. At exhaustion, heart rate exceeded 96% of maximum in both conditions. Core temperature reached 39.7°C in the 60% trial (58.9 min) and 39.0°C in the 75% trial (27.2 min) (P < 0.001). The rate of rise in core temperature was 2.1°C h−1 greater in the 75% trial than in the 60% trial (P < 0.001). A significant increase and correlation was observed between eHsp72 and eHsp27 concentrations at exhaustion (P < 0.005). eHsp72 was highly correlated with the core temperature attained (60% trial) and the rate of increase in core temperature (75% trial; P < 0.05). However, no common predictor variable was associated with the expression of both eHsps. The similarity in expression of eHsp72 and eHsp27 during moderate- and high-intensity exercise may relate to the duration (i.e., core temperature attained) and intensity (i.e., rate of increase in core temperature) of exercise. Thus, the immuno-inflammatory release of eHsp72 and eHsp27 in response to exercise in the heat may be duration and intensity dependent.

Abstract: Summary
Sophisticated mechanisms are employed to facilitate information exchange between interfacing bacteria. A type VI secretion system (T6SS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to deliver cell wall-targeting effectors to neighboring cells. However, the generality of bacteriolytic effectors and, moreover, of antibacterial T6S remained unknown. Using parameters derived from experimentally validated bacterial T6SS effectors we identified a phylogenetically disperse superfamily of T6SS-associated peptidoglycan-degrading effectors. The effectors separate into four families composed of peptidoglycan amidase enzymes of differing specificities. Effectors strictly co-occur with cognate immunity proteins, indicating that self-intoxication is a general property of antibacterial T6SSs and effector delivery by the system exerts a strong selective pressure in nature. The presence of antibacterial effectors in a plethora of organisms, including many that inhabit or infect polymicrobial niches in the human body, suggests that the system could mediate interbacterial interactions of both environmental and clinical significance.

Abstract: Summary
Typically, immune responses control the pathogen, while repair and stress pathways limit damage caused by pathogenesis. The relative contribution of damage to the outcome of pathogenesis and the mechanistic links between the immune and repair pathways are poorly understood. Here, we analyze how the entomopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas entomophila induces irreversible damage to the Drosophila gut. We find that P. entomophila ingestion induces a global translational blockage that impairs both immune and repair programs in the fly gut. P. entomophila-induced translational inhibition is dependent on bacterial pore forming toxins and reactive oxygen species produced by the host in response to infection. Translational arrest is mediated through activation of the GCN2 kinase and inhibition of the TOR pathway as a consequence of host damage. Together, our study draws a model of pathogenesis in which bacterial inhibition of translation by excessive activation of stress responsive pathways inhibits both immune and regenerative epithelial responses.

Abstract: Cytoplasmic axin expression frequently produces punctuate structures in cells, but the nature of axin puncta has not been fully elucidated. In an effort to analyze cytoplasmic axin puncta, we established HeLa cells expressing axin in a doxycycline-inducible manner (HeLa-Axin). We observed that axin accumulated in an aggregate-like pattern in perinuclear areas and appeared to be associated with mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but not lysosomes. Further biochemical analysis suggested that some part of the cytoplasmic axin pool was associated with mitochondria. In addition, mitochondrial proteins [i.e., cytochrome oxidase IV (CoxIV) and cytochrome c] were slightly higher in HeLa-Axin cells than in HeLa-EV cells, suggesting altered mitochondrial degradation. HeLa-Axin cells were then treated with staurosporine (STS) to determine if the mitochondria-induced apoptosis pathway was altered. Compared to STS-treated control cells (HeLa-EV), HeLa-Axin cells had less STS-induced cytotoxicity and reduced caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Given that mitochondria outer membrane potential was unchanged, HeLa-Axin cells might be relatively resistant to STS-mediated mitochondrial damage. Mitochondria associated with axin aggregates were resistant to detergent-mediated permeabilization. These results suggest that axin forms aggregate-like structures in association with mitochondria, which render mitochondria resistant to STS-induced membrane damage and cytotoxicity.
