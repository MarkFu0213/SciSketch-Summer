Abstract: Molecular chaperones constitute a major component of the cellular stress response machinery in neurodegenerative diseases, many of which are characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of endogenous cellular proteins into generic amyloid macrostructures. Heterologous expression of the yeast protein remodelling factor Hsp104 has been proposed as a possible therapeutic approach in such disease conditions. Hsp104 is unique in its ability to act as a protein ‘disaggregase’ by removing smaller units from amyloid fibrils and has no homologue in metazoa. The effect of Hsp104 is strongly modulated by its expression level. We show that at endogenous levels, the presence of Hsp104 has a deleterious effect on protein aggregation in two different strains of yeast. Overexpression of wild-type and mutant human α-synuclein in a well-validated yeast model of Parkinson's disease and in an isogenic Hsp104-deleted strain resulted in lower oxidative stress and reduced damage to cellular proteins in the latter case. This translated to lower cytotoxicity and increased cell viability. Endocytotic defect caused due to aggregation of α-syuclein was also rescued in cells lacking Hsp104. Our results show that the effect of overexpression of a chaperone on protein misfolding/aggregation cannot be predicted from its function in the host expression platform.

Abstract: The work-function of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes was tuned with an interfacial dipole layer (WPF-oxy-F) to reverse the polarity in polymer solar cells (PSCs) with an inverted structure. The photoactive layer was based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Silver (Ag) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were used as the top anode. The optimized conditions for the fabricated I-PSCs included an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68V, a fill factor (FF) of 64%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.86% through post-annealing at 170°C. The high performance of I-PSC is due partly to the improved interfacial contact at active/PEDOT:PSS and mainly to the increase of the work-function of annealed PEDOT:PSS/Ag at 170°C for 30min. Here, we investigated the effect of post-annealing on I-PSC devices by carrying out various annealing sequences.

The need to more precisely define aspects of skeletal muscle regeneration,

Abstract: A more precise definition of the term ‘skeletal muscle regeneration’ is required to reduce confusion and misconceptions. In this paper the term is used only for events that follow myofibre necrosis, to result in myogenesis and new muscle formation: other key events include early inflammation and revascularisation, and later fibrosis and re-innervation. The term ‘muscle regeneration’ is sometimes used casually for situations that do not involve myonecrosis; such as restoration of muscle mass by hypertrophy after atrophy, and other forms of damage to muscle tissue components. These situations are excluded from the definition in this paper which is focussed on mammalian muscles with the long-term aim of clinical translation to enhance new muscle formation after acute or chronic injury or during surgery to replace whole muscles. The paper briefly outlines the cellular events involved in myogenesis during development and post-natal muscle growth, discusses the role of satellite cells in mature normal muscles, and the likely incidence of myofibre necrosis/regeneration in healthy ageing mammals (even when subjected to exercise). The importance of the various components of regeneration is outlined to emphasise that problems in each of these aspects can influence overall new muscle formation; thus care is needed for correct interpretation of altered kinetics. Various markers used to identify regenerating myofibres are critically discussed and, since these can all occur in other conditions, caution is required for accurate interpretation of these cellular events. Finally, clinical situations are outlined where there is a need to enhance skeletal muscle regeneration: these include acute and chronic injuries or transplantation with bioengineering to form new muscles, therapeutic approaches to muscular dystrophies, and comment on proposed stem cell therapies to reduce age-related loss of muscle mass and function. This article is part of a directed issue entitled: Regenerative Medicine: the challenge of translation.

Abstract: Due to its potential use as selective surface in solar thermal absorbers, cobalt has been electrodeposited into porous alumina obtained by anodization of aluminum sheet. A 32 factorial design has been applied to find out the effects of the electrochemical variables, electrodeposition time and applied cell potential, on optical properties and to optimize the solar energy selectivity of the obtained surfaces. Effective-medium optical models have been used to reproduce their reflectance spectra and to estimate the thickness of the different layers that form the selective surface.

Abstract: Mitochondrial membrane lipid composition is a critical factor in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Exercise is the most prescribed therapeutic strategy against NASH and a potential modulator of lipid membrane. Thus, we aimed to analyze whether physical exercise exerted preventive (voluntary physical activity – VPA) and therapeutic (endurance training – ET) effect on NASH-induced mitochondrial membrane changes. Sprague-Dawley rats (n=36) were divided into standard-diet sedentary (SS, n=12), standard-diet VPA (SVPA, n=6), high-fat diet sedentary (HS, n=12) and high-fat diet VPA (HVPA, n=6). After 9 weeks of diet-specific feeding, half of SS and HS group were engaged in an ET program for 8 weeks/5 day/week/1h/day (SET, HET). Liver mitochondria were isolated for oxygen consumption and transmembrane-electric potential (ΔΨ) assays. Mitochondrial phospholipid classes and fatty acids were quantified through thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography, respectively, while cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylcholine (PC) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular profile was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. In parallel with histological signs of NASH, high-fat diet decreased PI, CL and PC/PE ratio, whereas PE and phosphatidic acid content increased in sedentary animals (HS vs. SS). Moreover, a decrease in linolelaidic, monounsaturated fatty acids content and an increase in saturated fatty acids (SFAS) were observed. Along with phospholipidomic alterations, HS animals showed a decrease in respiratory control ratio (RCR), ΔΨ and FCCP-induced uncoupling respiration (HS vs. SS). Both phospholipidomic (PC/PE, SFAS) and mitochondrial respiratory alterations were counteracted by exercise interventions. Exercise used as preventive (VPA) or therapeutic (ET) strategies preserved liver mitochondrial phospholipidomic profile and maintained mitochondrial function in a model of NASH.

Abstract: The electrical properties of polymer solar cells (PSCs) with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) embedded in the hole transport layers (HTLs) were investigated. The PSCs with AuNP-embedded HTLs exhibited 8%, 9.5%, and 22% enhancement in short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and power conversion efficiency, respectively. The low contact resistance at the active layer/HTL interface resulted in the high collection efficiency and low electron–hole recombination. The downshift of the Fermi energy in AuNP-embedded HTLs lowered the energy barrier and thinned the depletion layer at the active layer/HTL interface, accounting for the enhanced collection efficiency.

Abstract: Many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with oxidative stress and glial inflammation, all related to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Cyclo(His-Pro) is an endogenous cyclic dipeptide that exerts cytoprotection by interfering with the Nrf2–NF-κB systems, the former presiding the antioxidant and the latter the pro-inflammatory cellular response. Here we investigated whether the cyclic dipeptide inhibits glial inflammation thus reducing the detrimental effect of inflammatory neurotoxins on neurons. We found that systemic administration of cyclo(His-Pro) exerts in vivo anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system by down-regulating hepatic and cerebral TNFα expression thereby counteracting LPS-induced gliosis. Mechanistic studies indicated that the cyclic dipeptide-mediated effects are achieved through the activation of Nrf2-driven antioxidant response and the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway. Moreover, by up-regulating Bip, cyclo(His-Pro) increases the ER stress sensitivity and triggers the unfolded protein response to alleviate the ER stress. These results unveil a novel potential therapeutic use of cyclo(His-Pro) against neuroinflammatory-related diseases and we might now consider its potential anti-inflammatory role in other neuropathological conditions.

Fluoxetine suppresses AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway to promote hepatic lipid accumulation in primary mouse hepatocytes,

Abstract: In the previous study, we demonstrated that fluoxetine (FLX) regulated lipogenic and lipolytic genes to promote hepatic lipid accumulation. On this basis, underlying mechanisms were investigated by focusing on the intracellular signaling transduction in the present study using primary mouse hepatocytes. The expression of lipogenesis- and lipolysis-related genes was evaluated with the application of specific activators and inhibitors. Activation status of respective signaling pathway and the lipid accumulation in hepatocytes were analyzed. We provided evidence that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside) significantly suppressed the increased expression of representative lipogenesis-related genes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) by FLX, while increased the repressed expression of lipolysis-related genes, carboxylesterases. In the meanwhile, FLX regulated the above genes in the same way as AMPK inhibitor Compound C did. Furthermore, AICAR inhibited the proteolytic activation of SREBP1c induced by FLX, resulting in the decreased level of nuclear SREBP1c. Further studies demonstrated that FLX significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of AMPK and subsequent phosphorylation of ACC, following the inhibited phosphorylation and nuclear export of liver kinase B1 (LKB1). As a functional analysis, FLX-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was repeatedly abolished by AICAR. In conclusion, FLX-induced hepatic lipid accumulation is mediated by the suppression of AMPK signaling pathway. The findings not only provide new insight into the understanding of the mechanisms for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-mediated dyslipidemia effects, but also suggest a novel therapeutic target to interfere.

Abstract: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play an important role in maintaining immune tolerance in response to tumors and inflammatory diseases. Several liver MDSCs have been described in hepatitis in humans and mouse models. Although all the murine MDSCs are CD11b+Gr-1+, their true phenotype and mechanism of suppression remain elusive. This study revealed that SSChighCD11bhighLy-6ChighLy-6Glow monocytic cells but not the other liver-infiltrating, CD11b+Gr-1+ subsets could suppress CD4 T cell responses. Their suppressive activity was remarkably effective even at a ratio of 1:50 when co-cultured with CD4 T cells. Mechanistically, the suppression was dependent on nitric oxide production by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Furthermore, the suppressive function by these liver MDSCs was found to require direct contact with activated CD4 T cells. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate that these liver MDSCs can dramatically ameliorate concanavalin A (Con A)-induced fulminant hepatitis in mice. Finally, MDSC-mediated suppression in vivo was dependent on iNOS expression. Altogether, SSChighCD11bhighLy-6ChighLy-6Glow cells represent authentic MDSCs in the inflammatory liver and may function to minimize collateral damage caused by an overzealous CD4 T cell response following hepatitis infection.

Abstract: The Klotho gene functions as an aging suppressor gene. Evidence from animal models suggests that induction of Klotho expression may be a potential treatment for age-associated diseases. However, the molecular mechanism involved in regulating renal Klotho gene expression remains unclear. In this study, we determined that resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, induced renal Klotho expression both in vivo and in vitro. In the mouse kidney, resveratrol administration markedly increased both Klotho mRNA and protein expression. In resveratrol-treated NRK-52E cells, increased Klotho expression was accompanied by the upregulation and nuclear translocation of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and c-Jun. ATF3 or c-Jun overexpression enhanced the transcriptional activation of Klotho. Conversely, resveratrol-induced Klotho expression was attenuated in the presence of dominant-negative ATF3 or c-Jun. Coimmunoprecipitation and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that ATF3 physically interacted with c-Jun and that the ATF3/c-Jun complex directly bound to the Klotho promoter through ATF3- and AP-1-binding elements. c-Jun cotransfection augmented the effects of ATF3 on Klotho transcription in vitro. Although Sirtuin 1 mRNA expression was induced by resveratrol and involved in regulating Klotho mRNA expression, it was not the primary cause for the aforementioned ATF3/c-Jun pathway. In summary, resveratrol enhances the renal expression of the anti-aging Klotho gene, and the transcriptional factors ATF3 and c-Jun functionally interact and coordinately regulate the resveratrol-mediated transcriptional activation of Klotho.

Abstract: Surface passivation by hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiNx:H) is determined by the combined effect of two mechanisms: so-called chemical passivation by reducing the density of interface states (Dit) and field-effect passivation as a result of the number of fixed charges (Qf) at the interface with Si. These are related to the K defect center: *Si-N3. Defects near the interface (in both Si as in a-SiNx:H), modeled by force field Molecular Dynamics (MD) and ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT), can be related to Qf and Dit measured experimentally using CV-MIS (Capacitance–Voltage Metal–Insulator–Semiconductor). The compositional build up at the interface as is determined by HRTEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy) and modeled by MD corresponds to each other; a gradual change from Si to the bulk a-SiNx:H composition in the first 2nm of the a-SiNx:H layer. At the c-Si side a highly distorted layer (about 1–3nm) caused by the insertion of N and/or H is found. The insertion and adhesion of N into and at the Si surface is called nitridation and can be altered by using a NH3 plasma prior to a-SiNx:H deposition. HRTEM image analysis shows that by varying the nitridation of the Si surface the amount and penetration depth of N inside the Si surface is altered. Using MD modeling, it is shown that this process changes the amount of K-centers at the surface, which explains the variation in Qf and Dit that is found experimentally. Ab initio DFT studies of a-SiNx:H (x=1.17) show that K-centers and Si atoms in distorted configuration, are the dominating defects resulting in a higher Dit. For lower x (x=1) the Dit caused by K-centers increases, which is observed experimentally too.

Abstract: First principles calculations are carried out for investigating effect of dot-size and hydrogen passivation in silicon (Si) quantum dots. In this work, the electronic and optical properties of pure and hydrogen passivated Si quantum dots are explored. However, the importance of quantum confinements and hydrogen terminated surface on the energy gaps and optical absorption are discussed. Our results exhibit that the hydrogenated surface can cause modification in the electronic structure of Si quantum dot. It is found that the band gap increases as a function of size reduction in both passivated and unsaturated Si quantum dots because of quantum size effects. For the passivation of surface dangling bonds with hydrogen atoms, the energy gap is larger than that of pure Si quantum dots. Passivation with hydrogen atoms has a significant effect on the spatial distribution of the highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals. The impact of hydrogenation and dot-size on the optical absorption spectra and static dielectric constant is also inspected. Precisely, the dependence of dot-size and hydrogen passivation on the absorption threshold is elucidated. We surmise that this theoretical contribution can be valuable in discerning the microscopic processes for the future realization of nano-optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Electrochromic (EC) devices show a promise to be the next major advance in the energy-efficient window technology. However, the development of higher value (performance and cost) EC windows is the key to promote the applications of these energy saving devices. To that end, computer modeling may play a powerful role in providing in-depth understanding in EC device design, performance enhancement, material selection and development of EC layers. In this work, we describe a 2D time-dependent finite element based solver, established to simulate large area Li ion electrochromic devices. The results of 2D-model development and corresponding simulations are presented utilizing literature-based material properties. The capability of the model is demonstrated in handling a very large width-to-thickness aspect ratio and examining the impacts of a voltage change due to the spreading resistance and a diffusivity variation inside electrodes on device performance and lithium ion transport kinetics.

Abstract: In the multi wire sawing process the wire tension is an important parameter for reliability and wafer quality. Changes of wire quality and wire tension from one end of a wire web in a multi wire saw to the other are investigated by several methods: wire tension measurements in the wire saw, wire elongation during an industrial process and material testing of representative wires. Two mechanisms for the loss of wire tension are identified. Firstly, the decrease of wire diameter due to abrasion causes a slow loss of wire tension along the whole wire web. Secondly, plastic deformation of the wire due to random overloading leads to a fast decrease of the wire tension within the first few centimeters of the wire web. Both effects are confirmed by modeling and calculations.

Abstract: A composite of polyaniline (PANI) and cadmium sulfide nanoparticles (CdS NPs) has been synthesized electrochemically, which has further been used for the fabrication of photovoltaic cell. The composite (PCdS) has been characterized for its optical and electrochemical behavior. The efficacy of this composite for being used in photovoltaic cell has been studied by measuring its photo-electrochemical and photovoltaic response. The composite based device showed open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.332V and short circuit current (Isc) of 284µA under an illumination of the 590nm yellow incandescent light bulb having an intensity of 5.3mWcm−2. The efficiency and fill factor for our proposed solar cell were 0.48% and 27% respectively. Photo-electrochemical response showed excellent photon conversion behavior with respect to light intensity, thus confirming flow of electrons through external load during illumination of the cell.

Abstract: Interleukin-27 (IL-27), a key immunoregulatory cytokine plays an important role in host response to mycobacterial infection as neutralization of IL-27 augments intracellular killing of mycobacteria. Autophagy has a pivotal role in host immunity and is regulated by various cytokines. Here, we report that IL-27 inhibits IFN-γ and starvation induced autophagy and as a result blocks phagosome maturation and promotes intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Addition of exogenous IL-27 induces the activation of mTOR through JAK/PI3 K pathway and inhibits IFN-γ stimulated autophagy. Furthermore, blockade of JAKs obstructs the inhibitory effect of IL-27 on IFN-γ induced autophagy. Besides this, IL-27 also up-regulates Mcl-1through PI3 K pathway. We further show that in mTOR or Mcl-1 silenced THP-1 cells, IL-27 could no longer inhibit IFN-γ mediated autophagy in M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected cells. Altogether, our study demonstrates that IL-27 by concurrent activation of JAK/PI3 K/Akt/mTOR cascade as well as up-regulation of Mcl-1 inhibits IFN-γ induced autophagy and elimination of intracellular mycobacteria in macrophages.

Abstract: Silicon phthalocyanines with bulky axial ligands are interesting materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because they possess a strong absorption in the red region (~670nm) and their ligands hinder the stacking of their rings. This suppresses the formation of aggregates, a common tendency of dyes on the surface of dye-sensitized metal-oxide layers. Herein, the novel silicon phthalocyanine, Pc 61, which has ligands terminating in carboxylic acid groups has been synthesized, characterized and used in studies on the harnessing of photons in the long-wavelength visible light range. To investigate the relation between dye loading and performance of DSSCs, a series of Pc 61-sensitized TiO2 films and DSSC devices with different dye immersion times have been prepared and characterized through optical, electrical and laser spectroscopic studies. To our knowledge, this is the first time that injection rates of phthalocyanine-based DSSC performance have been assessed as a function of dye immersion time. The results of the incident photocurrent conversion efficiency (IPCE) and power conversion efficiency (ηeff) studies reveal that solar cells fabricated with a 120min Pc 61 immersion time have the best performance among the tested ones. This is corroborated by time-resolved emission lifetime data. Our studies demonstrate that the short photoluminescence lifetime of Pc 61–TiO2 films results from efficient electron injection by excited-state Pc 61 into the TiO2 film. This agreed with both experimentally obtained higher IPCE and higher ηeff.

Abstract: Hybrid bulk-heterojunction (HBH) nanostructure enables high excitons splitting efficiency by virtue of increasing contact area in the active layer. In this work, we have demonstrated a HBH solar cell based on all inorganic p-type and n-type nanoparticles. In order to facilitate charge transportation and collection after efficient excitons splitting, nanotetrapod shaped CdTe is used as p-type semiconductor and CdSe quantum dot as n-type material. The operation mechanism of HBH solar cells is demonstrated to be a donor–acceptor (D–A) model based on splitting of excitons. Besides the morphology and absorption characterization, photoluminescence quenching behavior is researched to show the excitons splitting process. Solar cells with HBH structure show promising photovoltaic performance, which benefits from the percolated donor–acceptor networks in the hybrid film. Our preliminary research shed light on the new development of solution based nanoparticles thin film solar cells.

Abstract: This paper reports the effect of thermal annealing on AlxOy/Pt/AlxOy multilayer solar absorber coatings deposited by an electron beam (e-beam) vacuum evaporator onto copper substrate at room temperature. The samples were annealed at different temperatures for different duration in air. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, UV–vis spectrophotometer and emissometer. The results showed changes in morphology, structure, composition, and optical properties depend on both temperature and duration of annealing. The XRD pattern showed the intensity of Pt decreased with increasing annealing temperature and therefore, disappeared at high temperature. With increasing annealing temperature, an increase in the size of Pt particles was observed from SEM. The AlxOy/Pt/AlxOy multilayer solar absorber coatings deposited onto Cu substrate were found to be thermally stable up to 500°C in air for 2h with good spectral selectivity (α/ε) of 0.951/0.09. At 600°C and 700°C, the spectral selectivity decreased to 0.92/0.10 and 0.846/0.11 respectively, which is attributed to the diffusion of Cu and formation of CuO and Cu2O phases. The formation of CuO and Cu2O phases were confirmed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and optical modelling. Long term thermal stability study showed the coatings were thermally stable in air up to 450°C for 24h.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene and is characterized by a perpetuated feedback loop of bacterial infection and inflammation. Both intrinsic (CFTR-dependent) and extrinsic (CFTR-independent) mechanisms contribute to the inflammatory phenotype of CF lung disease. Innate immune cells, initially recruited to combat bacterial pathogens, are acting in a dysregulated and non-resolving fashion in CF airways and cause harm to the host by releasing proteases and oxidants. Targeting harmful immune pathways, while preserving protective ones, remains the challenge for the future. This review highlights current concepts of innate immune dysregulation in CF lung disease. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Cystic Fibrosis: From o-mics to cell biology, physiology, and therapeutic advances.

Abstract: The causal agent of trichomoniasis is a parasitic protist, Trichomonas vaginalis, which is rich in proteolytic activity, primarily carried out by cysteine proteases (CPs). Some CPs are known virulence factors. T. vaginalis also possesses three genes encoding endogenous cystatin-like CP inhibitors. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize one of these CP inhibitors. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS), a cystatin-like peptidase inhibitor dubbed Trichocystatin-2 (TC-2) was identified in the T. vaginalis active degradome in association with TvCP39, a 39kDa CP involved in cytotoxicity. To characterize the TC-2 inhibitor, we cloned and expressed the tvicp-2 gene, purified the recombinant protein (TC-2r), and produced a specific polyclonal antibody (α-TC-2r). This antibody recognized a 10kDa protein band by western blotting. An indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and cell fractionation assays using the α-TC-2r antibody showed that TC-2 was localized in the cytoplasm and lysosomes and that it colocalized with TvCP39. TC-2r showed inhibitory activity against papain, cathepsin-L, and TvCP39 in trichomonad extracts and live parasites but not legumain-like CPs. Live trichomonads treated with TC-2r showed reduced trichomonal cytotoxicity to HeLa cell monolayers in a TC-2r-concentration-dependent manner. In this study, we identified and characterized an endogenous cystatin-like inhibitor in T. vaginalis, TC-2, which is associated with TvCP39 and appears to regulate the cellular damage caused by T. vaginalis.

Abstract: Boron-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:B or BZO) thin films prepared by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) are widely used as the front contact in thin-film solar cells. However, because reflection at the air/glass interface reduces the absorption of incident light, the short circuit current densities, as well as the efficiencies of the cells are deteriorated. To solve this problem, we proposed the combination of silicon dioxide (SiO2) antireflective (AR) coatings prepared by a sol–gel dip-coating method, with MOCVD-BZO films as the new substrate of the cell. The novel structure of the substrate obtained is: SiO2 AR coatings/glass/BZO. An improvement in the optical properties of the new substrate was achieved by destructive interference of the AR coatings at the coatings/air interface. Appling this novel substrate in amorphous silicon solar cells resulted in significant improvement of both the external quantum efficiency and the performance of the cell.

Abstract: We propose the deposition of ultra-thin silver layer (in subnano-scale) between bottom subcell and the hole-transport sublayer in the interlayer (IL), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), in the inverted tandem polymer solar cell (t-PSC) for improving the wettability of aqueous hole-transport interlayer on hydrophobic active layer so that the performance is significantly improved and larger active area is allowed. The inverted t-PSC is composed of bottom subcell (regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): indene-C60-bisadduct (ICBA)) and the top subcell (thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)) along with the IL, PEDOT:PSS/ZnO nanoparticles. For the small-area (0.03cm2) t-PSC, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be improved from 7.06% without Ag layer to 7.81% with depositing 0.5nm Ag layer, and the device production yield from 40% (4 out of 10 devices) to near 100% (10 out of 10 devices), which can be ascribed to more efficient hole collection and reducing leakage current for the bottom subcell due to improvement of film forming of PEDOT:PSS. As the active area is increased to 1cm2, a PCE of over 6% (6.11%) can also be achieved by this approach, which is much higher than that without such Ag layer (2.19%) by a factor of 2.78. The reported active area of inverted t-PSC is in the range 0.02–0.15cm2; while the present method allows an inverted t-PSC to enlarge its active area to 1cm2, yet the PCE can maintain over 6%.

Abstract: Highly-stable aqueous dispersion of (NH4)xWO3 crystallites (ac. 6–12nm in diameter and 20–100nm in length) with decent infrared shielding ability was synthesized at only 100°C. The effects of reducing agent (N2H4∙2HCl) dosage on the phase, morphology, zeta potential and composite of products have been systematically addressed. It was shown that the addition of N2H4∙2HCl in precursor solution introduced obvious oxygen deficiency into (NH4)xWO3 crystallites, resulting in a further improved NIR shielding ability. However, high dosages of N2H4∙2HCl were found to depress the zeta potentials and accelerate the growth of (NH4)xWO3 crystallites. A mechanism, which was reasonably supported by confirmatory experiments, was extracted to explain the result. To show potential application of our product, (NH4)xWO3-based flexible solar control foils were prepared by directly casting the dispersion onto polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. The foils can selectively cut-off near infrared light (NIR) by 65.8% (transmittance depressed from 91.3% of a bare PET to 25.5% of the foils), while maintaining a high visible transmittance of 67.6%, showing promise as energy-efficient filter.

Abstract: This work demonstrates the synthesis of MWCNT/TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites and their application for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under visible light irradiation. MWCNT/TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites were obtained from a newly developed coating approach. UV–vis analysis revealed that the photoactivity of the nanocomposites in the visible light range was significantly enhanced with the absorption edge extended to the visible light region (>400nm). The XRD and Raman analysis indicated that the TiO2 shell layer was composed of anatase TiO2 nanocrystallite prevailing grew along the (1 0 1) direction. The MWCNT/TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites exhibited conversion of CO2 into methane in a continuous process under a low power visible light irradiation at atmospheric pressure. The highest methane yield of ca. 0.17μmol/g-catalyst/h was recorded at the 6th hour of irradiation time.

Abstract: This paper reports on the photon and 8MeV electron irradiation effects on electrical parameters, quantum efficiency and minority carrier lifetime of a c-Si solar cell. The effect of subsequent photon irradiation on the silicon solar cells, degraded by 8MeV electron irradiation is also investigated. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of solar cells under AM0 illumination condition were studied before and after the irradiation. The solar cell parameters such as short circuit current (Isc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and conversion efficiency (η) were found to decrease after electron irradiation. A slight improvement in the electric performance of solar cells is observed after the photon irradiation. The spectral response shows that the quantum efficiency for low energy photons is reduced, suggesting that the damage is mainly inflicted to the bulk of the absorber material. This is strongly supported by the minority carrier lifetime results, which show a clear trend of decreasing carrier lifetime and carrier diffusion length as radiation dose increases.

Abstract: This work reports the synthesis and the characterization of amorphous CoxSiyOz thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering from a single cathode. Porous layers with outstanding electrochromic properties are obtained at room temperature in one step by performing the deposition at a glancing angle configuration. The electrochromic behavior of these layers in a basic aqueous medium was dependent on the Co/Si ratio in the films and in all cases was characterized by a fast response, a high coloration efficiency and a complete reversibility after several hundred cycles. A characteristic feature of these electrochromic layers is that, for a similar thickness, the range of transmittance modulation can be tuned by changing the Co/Si ratio in the films and, specifically for films with a high concentration of silicon, to change their aspect from an almost transparent to a full colored state.

Abstract: Ageing mechanisms at high temperatures were investigated for various commercially available solar thermal absorber coatings. The absorber surfaces were sputtered chromium–chromium oxide based coatings on copper, aluminium and anodized aluminium substrates, an evaporated titanium oxy-nitride coating on copper substrate and an electroplated black chromium coating on nickel coated copper. The absorbers were aged at high temperature according to ISO standard draft EN 12975-3-1 at 278°C for 600h. The ageing mechanisms and degradation of the absorbers were analyzed by optical measurements (solar absorptance by UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer and thermal emittance by FTIR spectrophotometer), microstructural analysis was made by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) with EDS, and composition analyzed by time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA) before and after the ageing tests. The ageing and degradation of the absorber coatings were observed. The ageing mechanisms were the diffusion of substrate atoms into the coating or all the way into the coating surface and the oxidation of the chromium or the titanium in the absorber coating. The microstructure of the absorber coatings affected stability at high temperatures. Absorbers with a dense sputtered coating structure aged significantly less than more porous structured coatings.

Abstract: We present two co-polymer families; one based on a thiophene-quinoxaline unit and one on a thiophene-pyrido pyrazine unit. Co-polymerization of these monomers with thiophene-hexylthiophene was performed to create polymers with an optical absorption that fully covers the visible part of the solar spectrum with the aim to enhance the solar cell performances of these polymers. We have also studied how increasing the fraction of thiophene-hexylthiophene affects the photo-oxidative stability of these polymers. Thiophene-pyrido pyrazine solar cells displayed increased device efficiency upon addition of the thiophene-hexylthiophene and, in addition, the stability is retained upon inclusion of these units. In contrast, we found that for the thiophene-quinoxaline based co-polymer, both device efficiency and stability decreased with increasing thiophene-hexylthiophene fraction. Moreover, our results indicate that the photo-oxidative stability of the thiophene-quinoxaline co-polymer is independent of the polymer molecular weight as well as of the film thickness.

Abstract: Tailoring the energy gap of ZnO through Cd doping renders Cd:ZnO an intriguing material for photovoltaic and solar cell applications. Unfortunately, the Cd:ZnO blend is unstable, a feature attributed to the structural differences between the parent hexagonal ZnO and cubic CdO. We here report a comparative density functional theory (DFT) study of zinc-blend (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) ZnO doped with Cd – upto 37.5% of the Zn atoms were substituted by an isovalent Cd. Interestingly, the nearly equivalent total energy of the ZB and WZ Cd:ZnO blends reflects the relative stability of the cubic phase. The formation enthalpies increase linearly with increasing Cd concentration. Cd insertion into ZnO is found to have an insignificant effect on the ZnO structure, with only a slight increase of the lattice constants that follow Vegard׳s formulation. Cd dopants efficiently reduce the electronic band gap of ZnO and in turn the absorption edge and optical energy gap are red-shifted. The Cd:ZnO blends exhibit a lower energy gap in the cubic phase as compared to the hexagonal phase, suggesting that a specific energy gap can be achieved at relatively lower Cd contents in the ZB. The lighter effective free-carrier masses in WZ-Cd:ZnO suggest a higher conductivity and mobility as compared to ZB and the parent ZnO. The narrow energy gaps indicate that both hexagonal and cubic Cd:ZnO systems have potential as material for solar energy applications.

Abstract: Module-level-processing applies cell processing and/or cell interconnection processes while the silicon wafers are attached to a sub- or superstrate, such as the module glass. This thin-film/wafer-hybrid- silicon (HySi) approach offers unique possibilities when using ultra-thin silicon wafers that can hardly be processed free-standing. Liquid adhesives are one option for attaching the wafers to the module glass. Here, we analyze the compatibility of a selection of adhesives with module-level processing. The adhesives have to be stable during wet chemical steps and during thermal treatments. A further requirement is that outgassing from the adhesives should be sufficiently low to allow efficient surface passivation by e.g. plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The adhesives have to withstand UV-irradiation and thermal exposure in order to fulfill warranty requirements. In this work we develop and apply tests for the screening of adhesives. We find that certain liquid addition-curing 2-part silicones pass all the tests and are thus attractive candidates for module-level-processing.

Abstract: Silicon based heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells show high efficiency enabled through excellent passivation by amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), the use of light trapping schemes and transparent conductive layers. Many different research groups and companies have achieved high open-circuit voltages above 730mV, but fill factors (FFs) at the level of conventional silicon solar cells are rare. One reason for a lower FF may be the (p)a-Si:H/TCO-contact, where a Schottky diode results. This can lead to an increased transport barrier adversely affecting the hole collection and thus the FF. The role of TCOs with work functions (WF) higher (tungsten oxide (WOx)) and lower (aluminium doped zinc oxide, AZO) than the standard ITO (indium tin oxide) will be examined experimentally in this paper. The aim of this paper is the proof of concept that WF engineering can improve the contact. Schottky theory with TCO WF values taken from the literature was the main assumption for the simulations and in the case of WOx at the hole contact, it could be shown that adjusting the TCO WF to (p)-a-Si:H decreases the Schottky barrier height.

Abstract: Colonic immune homeostasis is essential for normal gastrointestinal tract functioning. In this study, we report that specific gene targeting of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in smooth muscle cells caused age-related colonic lymphoid hyperplasia followed by global immune activation in mice. Beginning at 5 weeks of age, these mutant mice displayed massive neutrophil infiltration in the colonic lamina propria. The gene expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including those code for monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp-1), stromal cell-derived factor 1α (Sdf-1α), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 28 (Ccl-28), were upregulated in the colon. Accordingly, permeability and proliferation of the colonic epithelium was compromised. These abnormalities were alleviated to a great extent when the mutants were crossed with Akt1-null mice, indicating that the pathogenesis was mediated by Akt1 signaling. Our results suggest that in smooth muscle cells, PTEN is crucial for maintaining colonic immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films were prepared on glass substrates by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technology. Crystal structure, surface morphology, electrical properties and infrared reflection of the AZO films were systematically investigated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Hall measurement system and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. In addition, the corresponding properties of AZO films annealing at different temperatures ranging from room temperature to 400°C were also analyzed. The results indicate that the prepared AZO films exhibit highest ZnO (002) peak intensity and lowest electrical resistivity after annealing at 300°C. And AZO film with a low resistivity value of 0.0185Ω-cm, a relatively high average infrared reflection of 40% can be acquired after the films were annealed at 300°C. The high infrared reflection property of the AZO film makes it a promising candidate for future heat shielding film.

The ubiquitin E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168 are critical for foci formation, and here we aim to determine their dynamic mobility and abundance at individual foci in living cells. To this end, YFP-tagged RNF8 and RNF168 were expressed at physiological levels in MCF-7 cells, then analyzed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays, nuclear retention measurement, and virus-like particles (VLPs)-based quantification. The results showed that RNF8 and RNF168 were both highly dynamic at IR-induced foci. Intriguingly, RNF8 displayed remarkably faster in vivo association/dissociation rates than RNF168, and RNF8-positive IR-foci were less resistant to detergent extraction. In addition, copy number assay revealed that RNF168 was two-fold more abundant than RNF8 at foci. Collectively, we show for the first time that RNF8 moves on-and-off nuclear DNA repair foci more than six-fold as quickly as RNF168. The faster kinetics of RNF8 recruitment explains why RNF8 is generally observed at DNA-breaks prior to RNF168. Moreover, our finding that RNF8 is less abundant than RNF168 identifies RNF8 as a rate-limiting determinant of focal repair complex assembly.

Abstract: Tandem solar cells are the best approach to maximize the light harvesting and adjust the overall absorption of the cell to the solar irradiance spectrum. Usually, the front and back subcells are connected in series in two-terminal device (2T) designs which require a current matching between both subcells in order to avoid potential losses. Alternatively, they can also be connected in parallel giving rise to a three terminal connection (3T). In principle, both designs have their assets and drawbacks in terms of device performance, design and materials׳ characterization. In this letter, we theoretically and experimentally confront both designs with each other (2T and 3T). Theoretical estimations show a maximum PCE of 15% for 2T and about 13% for 3T structures with ideal bandgaps for the front and back cell. However, 3T tandem devices can yield higher efficiencies than 2T for some specific material combinations whose theoretical values are between 10% and 12%. Therefore, other aspects related to the fabrication feasibility are studied in order to analyze the most convenient approach for module development. The need of a conducting interlayer restricts the width of the cell and causes a 3% reduction in the geometrical fill factor of the module in comparison to the 2T approach. The R2R processing of modules with 3T cells would also require an additional laser step. Finally, a couple of existing material combinations have been experimentally implemented into 2T and 3T tandem devices. The limitation imposed by their specific and non-ideal bandgaps restricts the efficiency to around 7%, considerably below the ideal case.

Abstract: In this paper we present a brief review of studies that have reported therapeutic benefits of elevated cAMP on plasticity and regeneration after injury to the central nervous system (CNS). We also provide new data on the cellular mechanisms by which elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) promotes cytokine driven regeneration of adult CNS axons, using the visual system as the experimental model. cAMP is a second messenger for many intracellular signalling pathways. Elevation of cAMP in the eye by intravitreal injection of the cell permeant analogue (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; CPT-cAMP), when added to recombinant ciliary neurotrophic factor (rCNTF), significantly enhances rCNTF-induced regeneration of adult rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons into peripheral nerve (PN) grafted onto transected optic nerve. This effect is mediated to some extent by protein kinase A (PKA) signalling, but CPT-cAMP also acts via PI3K/Akt signalling to reduce suppressor of cytokine signalling protein 3 (SOCS3) activity in RGCs. Another target for cAMP is the exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac), which can also mediate cAMP-induced axonal growth. Here we describe some novel results and discuss to what extent the pro-regenerative effects of CPT-cAMP on adult RGCs are mediated via Epac as well as via PKA-dependent pathways. We used the established PN–optic nerve graft model and quantified the survival and regenerative growth of adult rat RGCs after intravitreal injection of rCNTF in combination with a selective activator of PKA and/or a specific activator of Epac. Viable RGCs were identified by βIII-tubulin immunohistochemistry and regenerating RGCs retrogradely labelled and quantified after an injection of fluorogold into the distal end of the PN grafts, 4 weeks post-transplantation. The specific agonists of either PKA or Epac were both effective in enhancing the effects of rCNTF on RGC axonal regeneration, but interestingly, injections that combined rCNTF with both agonists were significantly less effective. The results are discussed in relation to previous CPT-cAMP studies on RGCs, and we also consider the need to modulate cAMP levels in order to obtain the most functionally effective regenerative response after CNS trauma. This article is part of a directed issue entitled: Regenerative Medicine: the challenge of translation.

Abstract: The octadecane/exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP) shape-stabilized PCM (SSPCM) was prepared by impregnating octadecane as the PCM into xGnP in a vacuum. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy determined that the heat storage characteristics of octadecane could integrate into the structure of xGnP due to its physical bonding, without a change in its chemical properties. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that octadecane was evenly dispersed in the pores of xGnP. Differential scanning calorimeter analysis displayed that the melting temperature range of the SSPCM was similar to that of pure octadecane. Thermo gravimetric analysis measurements of the octadecane/xGnP SSPCM determined that the percentage of impregnated octadecane into xGnP was 55.9%, with 110.9J/g of latent heat storage energy. In addition, mortar with the prepared SSPCM was investigated, in terms of developing advanced building materials with thermal energy storage properties. The purpose was to improve the thermal properties of mortar by using the latent heat storage of the octadecane/xGnP SSPCM. In consequence, mortar preserved with the SSPCM could be utilized as a construction material that stored thermal energy, to result in saving in buildings energy consumption.

Abstract: The Ag/CdS core/shell nanoparticles are synthesized by a facile method. The synthesis steps are simple and easy to be manipulated. The core/shell nanostructures are characterized by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV–vis spectrometry techniques. Compared with bare Ag and CdS nanoparticles, the optical absorption of Ag/CdS composite nanostructures is greatly enhanced in a wide range of visible light. It can also be demonstrated in the simulations based on DDA method. The enhanced absorption of light is mainly due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect excited on silver core. The optical response of such core/shell nanostructures is extended to longer wavelengths.

Abstract: A controlled layer of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was grown directly on top of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrodes as a surface modifier for improving the performance of polymer solar cells. By using low-temperature chemical vapor deposition with short synthesis times, very short MWCNTs were grown, these uniformly decorating the FTO surface. The chemical vapor deposition parameters were carefully refined to balance the tube size and density, while minimizing the decrease in conductivity and light harvesting of the electrode. As created FTO/CNT electrodes were applied to bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells, both in direct and inverted architecture. Thanks to the inclusion of MWCNT and the consequent nano-structuring of the electrode surface, we observe an increase in external quantum efficiency in the wavelength range from 550 to 650nm. Overall, polymer solar cells realized with these FTO/CNT electrodes attain power conversion efficiency higher than 2%, outclassing reference cells based on standard FTO electrodes.

Abstract: In the present work, we have studied the effect of several sulphurization conditions on the properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films obtained through rapid thermal processing (RTP) of multi-period precursors with 8 periods of Zn/SnS2/CuS. In this study we varied the heating rate, the maximum sulphurization temperature, the time at maximum temperature and the amount of evaporated sulphur. The samples were characterized through scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Raman scattering spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence and I–V measurements. We have observed that at heating rates above 0.5°C/s the samples delaminated severely. As a result further tests were carried out at 0.2°C/s heating rate. The morphological studies revealed that the samples sulphurized at higher temperatures, shorter times and higher amount of evaporated sulphur exhibited larger grain sizes. The structural analysis based on Raman scattering and XRD did not lead to a clear distinction between the samples. Photoluminescence spectroscopy studies showed an asymmetric broad band characteristic of CZTS, which occurs in the range of 1.0–1.4eV and a second band, on the high energy side of the previous one, peaking at around 1.41eV. The intensity of this latter band varies from sample to sample revealing substantial differences in their optical properties. This band appears to originate either from the surface of the absorber or from the CdS layer and has a clear correlation with cell efficiency. The higher the intensity of this band the lower the cell efficiency, presumably due to the increase in recombination resulting from CZTS surface decomposition and eventually from the CdS with modified optoelectronic properties. The cell results hint toward a detrimental effect of long sulphurization times and a positive effect of higher sulphur vapour pressure and higher sulphurization temperature. Solar cell efficiencies improved with increased grain size in the absorber layer. The highest cell efficiency obtained in this study was 3.1%.

Abstract: Switchable mirrors based on magnesium–yttrium alloy thin films were prepared by a direct-current magnetron sputtering method. The changes in the film thickness of the mirrors due to hydrogenation and dehydrogenation have been investigated using atomic force microscopy and X-ray reflectometry. As a result of first hydrogenation of a switchable mirror, the thickness was expanded by ~15%, while as a result of dehydrogenation, the thickness was compressed by only ~2%. From the switching processes, the thickness changed by ~2% on the following optical switching. This small change may cause high switching durability of Mg–Y switchable mirrors.

Abstract: In this paper, we reported that ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) film modified with C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid ethyl ester (PyC60) was used as cathode buffer layer in inverted polymer solar cells. The resultant device with a blend of PTB7:PC71BM as photoactive materials exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.753V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 16.04mAcm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 72.5%, and an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.76%. It was higher than the control devices based on sole ZnO NPs film or ZnO: PyC60 hybrid film as cathode buffer layer. It was found that the morphology improvement of ZnO/PyC60 film contributed to reducing series loss and interfacial charge recombination. In addition, it improved the interfacial contact with photoactive layer. The results increased electron injection and collection efficiency, and improved FF.

Abstract: In this study, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the metal–organic interfaces of a P3HT:PCBM bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cell under a high electrical field. This high electrical field was built by applying reverse bias to the solar cell. This electrical field stress enhances the fill factor, short-circuits current and reduces series resistance. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency of a polymer solar cell enhanced by 8.3% compared to an unstressed solar cell. In addition, the reverse current density was quite low, consumed only a small amount of energy (0.36mJ/cm2) during stressing. The intermixing and atomic concentration gradient of Al and C shown by an XPS depth profile confirmed the penetration of Al into the polymer layer under a large electrical field, which improved the contact properties.

Abstract: Effects of 350°C preheating of electrochemically stacked Cu–Sn–Zn layers in an inert atmosphere on structural and morphological properties of quaternary kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) films obtained by sulfurization of the metallic layers were investigated. When the CZTS film was fabricated without the 350°C preheating, the film contained a secondary Cu2SnS3 phase and other impurities. The CZTS film also showed poor adhesion to the bottom molybdenum (Mo) substrate with many crevices and voids in the film; a very thick MoS2 layer was formed at the top part of the Mo layer. These structural failures of the CZTS film were significantly reduced when the metallic precursor was preheated at 350°C before sulfurization for 20min: the CZTS film thus-obtained exhibited no secondary phases, good adhesion to the bottom Mo layer, flat and densely packed surface morphology, no appreciable crevices or voids, and formation of a relatively thin MoS2 layer. Based on results of studies on structural transformations during 350°C preheating and successive sulfurization, such differences in properties of resulting CZTS films are attributed to differences in formation pathways. Moreover, since 350°C preheating for a longer duration was found to be detrimental for the properties of resulting CZTS films, there should be an optimum duration of preheating to achieve a good CZTS film for solar cell application. As expected from these properties, the solar cell with an Al:ZnO/CdS/CZTS/Mo structure derived from the metallic precursor preheated at 350°C for 20min showed the best conversion efficiency of 5.6%.

Abstract: Pd-capped magnesium–yttrium alloy switchable mirrors were found to have high switching durability of over 10,000 cycles between reflective and transparent states. However, the durability decreased with the decreasing Pd thickness. Switchable mirrors with various Pd thicknesses were then prepared by a direct-current magnetron sputtering method, and the degradation in durability was studied by observing the distribution of each element of the switchable mirrors from the film surface to the substrate. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that Pd with a short sputtering time (corresponding to layer thickness of 3nm) resulted in surface oxidation of Mg and Y, and no Pd was present at the surface. The deposited Pd was alloyed with the Mg–Y layer and after taking the sample out from the vacuum chamber a Pd-rich layer appeared between the surface oxides and the Mg–Y layers. With increasing deposition time, a Pd layer was formed on the oxide layer and the Pd layer thickness increased. The mirror with switching durability of over 10,000 cycles had a sufficiently thick Pd top layer of ~7nm and a very thin oxide layer. This thick Pd layer is believed to be the reason for the high switching durability.

Abstract: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays an important immunological role in the retina and it is involved in many ocular inflammatory diseases that may end in loss of vision and blindness. In this work the role of phospholipase D (PLD) classical isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, in the inflammatory response of human RPE cells (ARPE-19) was studied. ARPE-19 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10μg/ml) displayed increased levels of NO production and diminished mitochondrial function after 48h of incubation. Furthermore, 24h LPS treatment strongly induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). EGFP-PLDs showed the typical subcellular localization, perinuclear for PLD1 and plasma membrane for PLD2. LPS increased PLD activity by 90% with respect to the control. The presence of PLD1 inhibitor (EVJ 0.15μM) or PLD2 inhibitor (APV 0.5μM) reduced LPS-induced COX-2 induction but only PLD2 inhibition reduced ERK1/2 activation. Mitochondrial function was restored after inhibition of PLD2 and ERK1/2. These findings evidence the participation of PLD2 as a promoter of RPE inflammatory response through ERK1/2 and COX-2 regulation. Our results demonstrate for the first time distinctive roles of PLD isoforms in pathological conditions in RPE.

Wortmannin potentiates the combined effect of etoposide and cisplatin in human glioma cells,

Abstract: The combination of etoposide and cisplatin represents a common modality for treating of glioma patients. These drugs directly and indirectly produce the most lethal DNA double-stand breaks (DSB), which are mainly repaired by non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ). Drugs that can specifically inhibit the kinase activity of the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), the major component of NHEJ, are of special interest in cancer research. These small molecule inhibitors can effectively enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments that generate DNA damage. In this study, we investigated the effect of DNA-PKcs inhibitor, wortmannin, on the cytotoxic mechanism of etoposide and cisplatin in MO59K and MO59J human glioblastoma cell lines. These cell lines are proficient and deficient in DNA-PKcs, respectively. Wortmannin synergistically increased the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and etoposide, when combined, in NHEJ-proficient MO59K cells. Surprisingly, wortmannin sensitizing effect was also observed in DNA-PKcs-deficient MO59J cells. These data suggest that wortmannin sensitization to etoposide and cisplatin in human glioma cells is mediated by inhibition of not only DNA-PKcs activity but other enzymes from PI3-K family, e.g. ATM and ATR. A concentration-dependent increase in etoposide and cisplatin-induced DSB levels was potentiated by inhibitor in both cell lines. Moreover, drug-induced accumulation in the G2/M checkpoint and S-phase was increased by wortmannin. Wortmannin significantly inhibited drug-induced DSB repair in MO59 cells and this effect was more pronounced in MO59J cells. We conclude that the mechanism of wortmannin potentiation of etoposide and cisplatin cytotoxicity involves DSBs induction, DSBs repair inhibition, G2/M checkpoint arrest and inhibition of not only DNA-PKcs activity.

Abstract: Intracellular cAMP level and cAMP mediated responses are elevated when Leishmania are exposed to macrophage phagolysosome conditions (37°C and pH 5.5). Phosphodiesterases play major role in cAMP regulation and in the present study we have cloned and characterized a 2.1kb cytosolic isoform of phosphodiesterase from Leishmania donovani (LdPDED) which plays important role in cAMP homeostasis when the promastigotes are exposed to macrophage phagolysome conditions for converting to axenic amastigotes. Domain characterization suggested the presence of two pseudo-substrate sites similar to the ones present in the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and a putative PKA phosphorylation site at T708 of C-terminus of LdPDED. Deletion constructs and site directed mutagenesis revealed the ability of LdPDED to interact with L. donovani PKA catalytic subunits (LdPKAC1 and LdPKAC2) resulting in inhibition of kinase activity in one hand and increase of phosphodiesterase activity through PKA mediated phosphorylation at putative phosphorylation site on the other hand. This study therefore identifies a unique phosphodiesterase in L. donovani which appears to regulate cAMP-dependent PKA signaling through a two way process.

Abstract: Electrochromic NixW1−x oxide thin films with 0.5<x<1 were deposited by reactive DC magnetron co-sputtering from pure Ni and W metal targets. Films with different compositions were characterized structurally by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. The optical and electrochemical properties were investigated by spectrophotometry and cyclic voltammetry in LiClO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate. Pure Ni oxide films were crystalline, but even small amounts of W led to amorphous structures. The NixW1−x oxide films probably consisted of hydrated Ni oxides and NiWO4. Charge insertion/extraction and optical modulation were modest. Aging of the films led to strong bleaching. Concerning electrochromic properties, the W addition was beneficial and enhanced the bleached-state transmittance for all compositions at luminous and near-infrared wavelengths.

Abstract: Because of ease in ensuring chemical integrity and purification, small molecular materials are promising as alternatives for polymeric electron-donor materials in solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photocells. On the other hand, replacement of modified fullerene with neat one potentially reduces both economical and environmental costs of the photocells. In this paper, solution-processed BHJ photocells with a small molecular electron-donor 7,7′-[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo [3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]bis[6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole] (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and neat C70 are studied. The devices showed a power conversion efficiency of approximately 1.3% after optimal thermal annealing. Analysis of current–voltage characteristics using an equivalent circuit model suggests that the thermal annealing enhances not only the generation but also the internal recombination of photocarriers.

Abstract: In this study we perform an extensive campaign of numerical simulations of thin-film solar cell structures aimed at investigating how the conduction band offsets at buffer/window (ΔBW) and buffer/absorber (ΔAB) heterojunctions and the thickness and doping of the buffer layer combine to affect the performance parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and η). For the two scenarios of ideal (i.e., without traps) and non-ideal (with traps) buffer/absorber interface, we vary ΔAB and ΔBW in the range −0.5eV to 0.5eV, and analyze, for each combination, the physical mechanisms limiting the cell performance and the way to optimize it by choosing optimal buffer doping and thickness. We show that assuming ΔAB as the main indicator for the potential performance of a cell can be misleading because ΔBW can heavily influence performance, even when ΔAB is positive (conduction band higher in the buffer than in the absorber) and near to its theoretical optimal value (0.3eV). However, we also show that ΔAB<0 (conduction band lower in the buffer than in the absorber) is usually coupled with an efficiency loss that is even worse if ΔBW>0. We verify our findings by simulating several examples of CIGS-based solar cells with different buffer layers (CdS, Zn1−xMgxO, In2S3, Zn(O,S)) taken from the literature; these comparisons confirm the validity of our results and suggest that the combination of ΔAB and ΔBW is the predominant factor in the design of high-efficiency solar cells. We finally propose simple quantitative guidelines for thin-film solar cell design and optimization.

Abstract: A model for the prediction of the thermal conductivity of molten alkali and alkaline earth salts is proposed. The model is a function of simple thermophysical properties of salts. The parameters required in the calculations are density, heat capacity, velocity of sound and melting temperature. Predictions are in good agreement with reliable experimental and molecular dynamics simulation data. The model displays the correct dependence of the thermal conductivity on temperature, and this is a useful method for a first evaluation of future experimental data.

Abstract: Sugar alcohols as phase change materials (PCM) are very promising due to their high storage capacity, safety and economic reasons. Their phase change temperatures make them suitable for medium temperature storage, which is needed for solar process heat or waste heat recovery applications. To guarantee a long PCM working lifetime they should be tested under a repeated number of freezing/melting cycles to check whether the thermophysical properties remain constant or not. The cycling stability of d-mannitol, myo-inositol and galactitol has been studied with DSC and the chemical stability with FT-IR. Myo-inositol shows a good cycling stability under the chosen measuring parameters. The cycling and chemical stability of d-mannitol up to 20 cycles can be achieved by controlling some parameters. The variable affecting it the most is the amount of oxygen in contact with it. Hence, in the storage unit this could be prevented with an inert or vacuum atmosphere.

Abstract: In this work, silicate glass slides were doped with silver or copper by ion exchange in molten salts in order to obtain luminescent sheets suitable as down-shifters to be used for covering and protecting solar cells. The samples were treated at different temperatures, in nitrate, sulfate and chloride salts, for different times. Post-exchange thermal treatments were performed on some of them in order to tailor the ion aggregation states and their luminescence features. Optical absorption and near ultraviolet–visible luminescence analyses were performed in order to test the suitability of the samples as down-shifters and, moreover, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses were performed on copper doped samples in order to better identify the oxidation states of the incoming ion as a function of the synthesis parameters. The performance of the best samples was tested by measuring the output power of a GaAs solar cell covered with the treated glass slides and illuminated with a solar simulator lamp.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase regulates inflammatory gene expression by changing DNA methylation level in 3T3 adipocytes,

Abstract: Adipocytes are one of the primary sources of inflammatory cytokines that drive the low-grade inflammation associated with obesity and obesity-related diseases. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase, a key adipogenic enzyme in rodents and humans, plays significant role in the regulation of adipocyte inflammation via a mechanism that involves the regulation of inflammatory gene expression. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1-related regulation of gene expression might be driven by changes in DNA methylation. We showed that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 overexpression causes the global hypomethylation of DNA, even as early as 12h after the induction of differentiation, with the greatest difference seen in mature adipocytes. In contrast, both the silencing of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene expression by siRNA and inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 activity resulted in DNA hypermethylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The analysis of the promoter methylation of 22 genes that are related to the inflammatory response showed that the level of methylation of CpG sites in interleukin-10 receptor a, interleukin-4 receptor a, interleukin-6 signal transducer, and transforming growth factor β 1 promoters was strongly related to stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 expression or activity. The changes in methylation at CpG promoter sites correlated with differential expression of the aforementioned genes. The results show that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 regulates the level of DNA methylation in adipocytes and suggest that the mechanism by which stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 affects adipocyte inflammation may involve changes in the methylation of inflammatory genes.

Abstract: Several industrial n-type Czochralski silicon ingots were analysed on wafer and cell levels with ECN׳s bifacial n-type solar cell process. In some of the ingots, the solar cell performance in the very top drop of about 1% absolute with respect to cell from the middle part of the ingot. These cells show typical ring shaped pattern. After receiving a post-process anneal treatment at 200°C, the efficiency nearly completly recover. We demonstrated that the improvement is due to bulk lifetime enhancement. The recovery is stable in storage conditions, under illumination and high temperature treatments up to 600°C. The same effect cannot be reproduced in p-type Cz silicon solar cells with similar ring shaped patterns. This indicates that the defects responsible for lifetime and efficiency degradation in wafers affected by ring patterns differ in n-type and p-type.

Abstract: Background and aims
Augmenter of Liver Regeneration is a protein encoded by the Growth Factor Erv1-Like gene. Its biological properties are crucial for cell survival since knock-out mice for Growth Factor Erv1-Like gene do not survive. In this study, we injected hepatotropic adenoviral particles harboring oligonucleotide sequences against Growth Factor Erv1-Like gene into 70% partially hepatectomized rats and studied the effect of gene silencing on the progression liver regeneration.
Methods
Partially hepatectomized rats were divided into three groups of animals and, before surgery, received either phosphate buffer saline, or adenoviral particles alone or adenoviral particles harboring the oligonucleotide silencing sequence. In each group, rats were sacrificed at 12, 24 and 48h after surgery. Liver tissues were collected to analyze the expression of Augmenter of Liver Regeneration, Bax, Bcl-2 and activated Caspase-9 and -3, as well as hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis, polyamines levels and histological and ultrastructural features.
Results
Growth Factor Erv1-Like gene silencing reduced the compensatory hepatocellular proliferation triggered by surgery through (i) the reduction of polyamines synthesis, hepatocyte proliferation and anti-apoptotic gene expression and (ii) the increase of pro-apoptotic gene expression and caspase activation.
Conclusions
For the first time, using a technique of gene silencing in vivo, our results demonstrate that Growth Factor Erv1-Like gene knock-down, i.e., the lack of Augmenter of Liver Regeneration, modifies the expression of genes involved in cell apoptosis and inhibits early phase of DNA synthesis. As a consequence, a promotion of cell death and a reduction of cell proliferation occurs.

Abstract: Introduction
Recent studies in image cytometry evaluated the replacement of specific markers by morphological parameters. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a method to identify subtypes of leukocytes using morphometric data of the nuclei.
Method
The analyzed images were generated with a laser scanning cytometer. Two free programs were used for image analysis and statistical evaluation: Cellprofiler and Tanagra respectively. A sample of leukocytes with 200 sets of images (DAPI, CD45 and CD14) was analyzed. Using feature selection, the 20 best parameters were chosen to conduct cross-validation.
Results
The morphometric data identified the subpopulations of the analyzed leukocytes with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.95 per sample.
Conclusion
The present study is the first that identifies subpopulations of leukocytes by nuclear morphology.

Abstract: A novel four-layer structured Cr–Al–O tandem nano-multilayer composite coating has been prepared by cathodic arc ion plating for solar selective absorbing. The four-layer structured coating consists of pure chromium layer, low oxygen content Cr–Al–O layer (LOCL), middle oxygen content Cr–Al–O layer (MOCL) and high oxygen content Cr–Al–O layer (HOCL). The composition, structure, and surface morphology of the coating were characterized using SEM, EDS, XPS, TEM, and AFM. The optical performances of the coating were measured by spectrophotometer, while the thermal stability of the coating was evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. Results showed that LOCL and MOCL, in which amorphous Cr–Al–Ox nanolayers and composite Cr–Al–Ox nanolayers embedded with Cr2Al nanograins alternated with each other, were the main absorbers, while HOCL acted as an antireflection layer. The coating exhibited a relatively high absorptance of 0.924 and a relatively low emittance of 0.21, as well as an outstanding thermal stability with a selectivity of 0.919/0.225 even after annealing at 700°C for 2h in air, which properties rendered the four-layer structured Cr–Al–O tandem coating a potential material for photo-thermal conversion at high temperatures.

Abstract: Tip110 is a nuclear protein and has been shown to function in tumor antigenicity, regulation of gene transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, stem cell proliferation and differentiation, and embryonic development. To characterize the in vivo functions of Tip110, a transgene cassette expressing human Tip110 protein (hTip110) was used to generate hTip110 transgenic (Tg) mice. Unexpectedly, only Tip110 mRNA but not Tip110 protein was expressed in Tg MEF and tissues. Treatment of Tg MEF with proteasome inhibitors led to detection of hTip110 protein, which prompted us to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of Tip110 degradation in mouse cells. We found that hTip110 was more sensitive to ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-mediated protein degradation than mouse Tip110 (mTip110), likely resulting from more hTip110 ubiquitination. Using affinity chromatography and proteomics, we identified USP15, a deubiquitinating enzyme, to be associated with Tip110. Tip110 expression led to re-distribution of USP15 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and complete co-localization of Tip110 with USP15 in the nucleus, whereas USP15 expression resulted in hTip110 deubiquitination. Interestingly, USP15 knockdown restored hTip110 protein expression in Tg MEF and USP15 expression had little effects. Taken together, these results provide insights into the regulatory mechanism of human Tip110 degradation by USP15.

Abstract: A comparison of the calculated results with the experimental data shows that the measured dark I–V characteristics of efficient thin-film CdS/CdTe cells are quantitatively described in terms of the Sah–Noyce–Shockley theory of generation–recombination in the space-charge region of the heterostructure. The expressions for the quantum efficiency spectra, taking into account the drift and diffusion components and recombination on the front and rear surfaces of the CdTe absorber layer, also describe the observed spectra in detail. The process of comparison and adjustment of the calculated results with the actual measurements provides a quite accurate determination of the main parameters of the CdTe layer and the diode structure, which in turn enables us to make some recommendations to correct these parameters to increase the efficiency of CdS/CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: Cell efficiency distribution of mono-like silicon ingot was investigated. And a long low-efficiency tail was found in the efficiency distribution chart, which degraded the cost-effectiveness of this material. Highly spatial resolved photoluminescence and electron back-scattered diffraction characterizations of the mono-like silicon wafers were performed to investigate the low-efficiency reasons. In the experiments, we found that lots of sub-grains, invisible with naked eyes, formed by low angle grain boundaries and high density of dislocations. Relationship of low angle grain boundaries, dislocations and cell efficiency were also investigated and calculated. It is found that the density of dislocations and low angle grain boundaries increase rapidly in the directional solidification of mono-like silicon ingot. Wafers from the top side of the ingot had high density of dislocations and low angle grain boundaries, which led to low-efficiency cell performance and long low-efficiency tail distribution.

Abstract: In this study we investigated the effect of linsitinib on the reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by the overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily members ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1 and ABCC10. Our results indicate for the first time that linsitinib significantly potentiate the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs mitoxantrone (MX) and SN-38 in ABCG2-overexpressing cells; paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinblastine in ABCC10-overexpressing cells. Linsitinib moderately enhanced the cytotoxicity of vincristine in cell lines overexpressing ABCB1, whereas it did not alter the cytotoxicity of substrates of ABCC1. Furthermore, linsitinib significantly increased the intracellular accumulation and decreased the efflux of [3H]-MX in ABCG2-overexpressing cells and [3H]-paclitaxel in ABCC10-overexpressing cells. However, linsitinib, at a concentration that reversed MDR, did not significantly alter the expression levels of either the ABCG2 or ABCC10 transporter proteins. Furthermore, linsitinib did not significantly alter the intracellular localization of ABCG2 or ABCC10. Moreover, linsitinib stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Overall, our study suggests that linsitinib attenuates ABCG2- and ABCC10-mediated MDR by directly inhibiting their function as opposed to altering ABCG2 or ABCC10 protein expression.

Abstract: CuInSe2 solar cells were prepared from electrodeposited and annealed stacks of indium selenide and copper selenide on molybdenum (Mo/In2Se3/Cu–Se). In comparison to a simultaneous electrodeposition of all elements at once the electrodeposited binary selenide stack leads to larger grains and lattice coherence length if annealed under the same conditions (30min at 550°C). Absorbers with atomic Cu/In ratios <1, 1 and >1 and their corresponding solar cells were characterized. An incomplete reaction in case of the Cu-poor precursor caused a Cu-deficient layer at the back contact of the absorber leading to the formation of a reverse electronic barrier reducing fill factor and short circuit current and thus the solar power conversion efficiency. Photoluminescence measurements showed a strongly compensated semiconductor for the Cu-poor absorber and an incomplete charge carrier collection was identified by quantum efficiency measurements under reverse bias. The reverse electronic barrier, the high compensation and the incomplete carrier collection could be avoided by Cu-rich growth conditions. The appearance of an excitonic transition in photoluminescence indicated a high semiconductor quality in this case. It was linked with a high quantum efficiency resulting in a local short-current density of 38.3mA/cm2. Temperature-dependent JV measurements identified interface recombination as the limiting recombination loss mechanism for the Cu-rich grown solar cell reducing the open-circuit potential and decreasing the conversion efficiency. The solar cell prepared from the precursor with Cu/In≈1 had similar properties as the Cu-poor device without the reverse electronic barrier at the back contact but instead dominating interface recombination. It reached a best solar power conversion efficiency of 5.5%.

Abstract: Formation of S-shaped I–V curve or the so-called kink has been shown detrimental to organic solar cells (OSC) performance. Previous researches have indicated that a variety of reasons could count for the origin of the S-shaped I–V curve. However, its origin is still not clear. In this contribution, we investigated the origin of S-shaped I–V curve from the view of an equivalent circuit model (ECM) in OSCs. The proposed ECM involves a rectifying junction connected with a donor/accepter (D/A) junction in series. OSCs with and without a Schottky barrier that was a rectifying junction were fabricated to verify the modeled results. And the good reproduction of experimental results confirmed the validity of our model. The results indicate that the origin of S-shaped I–V curve in OSCs is associated with the rectifying junction. With this model, the effects of the rectifying junction on the shape of I–V characteristic and its effect on device parameters are analyzed: fill factor (FF) dropped, short circuit current density decreased, open circuit voltage however, remained. Also, from simulation, we varied the parameters of the rectifying junction to study their influence on the device performance.

Abstract: Semiconductor–insulator–semiconductor (SIS) hetero-junction solar cells comprising of the amorphous indium zinc oxide (a-IZO) layer directly deposited onto the n-type Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition were fabricated. Characterizations on the physical properties of the a-IZO layer and the a-IZO/SiOx interface as a function of In/(Zn+In) ratio were carried out to delineate their influences on the photovoltaic performance of SIS solar cells. The optical and electrical analyses indicated that the resistivity of a-IZO films decreased with increasing In concentration, reaching 4.5×10−4Ω-cm for In/(Zn+In)=0.5, which also exhibited a transmittance higher than 80% in the visible-light wavelength range. Moreover, combining with an optimally controlled insulating SiOx layer (about 2.0nm), the device exhibited excellent SIS solar cell performance with open-circuit voltage of 0.38V, short-circuit current density of 45.1mAcm−2, fill factor of 49.7% and a conversion efficiency of 8.4% under the AM1.5 illumination condition. The dramatic performance enhancement was attributed to the reduction of effective interface trap densities at the a-IZO/SiOx interface and the increase of carrier mobility in the a-IZO layer resulted from the increase of In/(In+Zn) ratio.

Abstract: Purpose
To determine the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in a Peruvian cohort with HER2-amplified and triple negative breast cancers (TNBC).
Methods
We analyzed two cohorts of 134 primary non-metastatic breast cancer patients from Peru. Cohorts consisted of 51 hormone receptors (+)/HER2-amplified breast tumor patients surgically resected as first treatment included in the ALTTO trial (ALTTO cohort) and 81 TNBC patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment (neoadjuvant cohort). Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Samples from the ALTTO and neoadjuvant cohorts were taken at biopsies and from residual tumors, respectively. PIK3CA mutations were detected by sequencing DNA fragments obtained by PCR amplification of exons and their flanking introns. All of the detected PIK3CA mutations were confirmed in a second independent run of sample testing.
Results
PIK3CA mutations were present in 21/134 cases (15.7%). Mutations in exon 9 and 20 were present in 10/134 (7.5%) and 11/134 (8.2%), respectively. No cases had mutations in both exons. Mutations in exon 9 consisted of E545A (seven cases), E545K (two cases) and E545Q (one case); while in exon 20, mutations consisted of H1047R (10 cases) and H1047L (one case). Compared to TNBC patients, HER2-amplified patients were more likely to have PIK3CA mutated (23% vs 9.6%; P=0.034). There were no associations between mutational status of PIK3CA with estrogen receptor status (P=0.731), progesterone receptor status (P=0.921), age (P=0.646), nodal status (P=0.240) or histological grade (P=1.00). No significant associations were found between PIK3CA mutational status and clinicopathological features.
Conclusions
We found a similar frequency of PIK3CA mutations to that reported in other series. Although we did not include HR+/HER2 patients, those with HER2-amplified tumors were more likely to present PIK3CA mutations compared to patients with triple negative tumors.

Abstract: With the ever-increasing focus on obtaining higher device power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for organic photovoltaics (OPV), there is a need to ensure samples are measured accurately. Reproducible results are required to compare data across different research institutions and countries and translate these improvements to real-world production. In order to report accurate results, and additionally find the best-practice methodology for obtaining and reporting these, we show that careful analysis of large data sets can identify the best fabrication methodology. We demonstrate which OPV outputs are most affected by different fabrication or measurement methods, and identify that masking effects can result in artificially-boosted PCEs by increasing fill factor and current densities, requiring care when selecting which mask to use. For example, our best performing devices (>6% efficiency) show that the smallest mask areas have not produced a surfeit of the highest performers, with only 11% of the top performing devices measured using a 0.032cm2 mask area, while 44% used the largest mask (0.64cm2). This trend holds true for efficiencies going down to 5%, showing that effective fabrication conditions are reproducible with increasing mask areas, and can be translated to even larger device areas. Finally, we emphasise the necessity for reporting the best PCE along with the average value in order to implement changes in real-world production.

Abstract: The heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), a regulator of translation initiation, is known to be activated and upregulated, and it acts as either a cytoprotective player promoting cell survival or as an inducer of apoptosis during stress. However, the exact role of HRI in these two responses has not been elucidated. In the present investigation, using human cell lines, we attempted to unravel the molecular mechanism(s) of HRI-mediated differential response and the involved signaling pathways. While during low dose (5μM) lead acetate treatment, cells did not show any diminished cell survival, significant level of apoptosis was observed at high dose (100μM) lead acetate. Based on the results of an interactome analysis, we determined the interaction of HRI with PI-3-Kca, only at a low dose stress, which is followed by phosphorylation and activation of its downstream target, AKT. Interestingly, such an interaction and AKT activation was not observed at a high dose stress. On the other hand, an increased level of APAF-1 and activation of caspases were observed. These results indicate a critical role of HRI in cell survival during low dose stress, and in apoptosis at high dose stress. Furthermore, HRI knockdown cells are sensitized even to 5μM lead treatment leading to caspase activation and apoptosis. Our results taken together thus elucidate for the first time the molecular mechanism and the involved signaling pathways for dose-dependent differential response of mammalian cells to lead exposure. These findings thus suggest the possibility of using HRI downregulation as a therapeutic strategy to sensitize cancer cells subjected to apoptogenic drugs.

Abstract: Different types of boron-doped window layers have been prepared by radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) at a low temperature of 150°C. The effects of perpendicular transport behavior on the properties of n–i–p type amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cells, which involve inner perpendicular conductivity of p layers, perpendicular transport properties at p/ITO interfaces and recombination kinetics at i/p interfaces have been investigated by perpendicular dark conductivity, potential barrier at p/ITO and dark current–voltage characteristics of n-i-p a-Si diodes, respectively. High doping efficiency in the window layers with nano-sized silicon crystals has been observed to facilitate the significant improvement of perpendicular dark conductivity and transport behavior at p/ITO interfaces. The dark current–voltage characteristics indicated intrinsic a-Si/p-type microcrystalline silicon heterojunction transitions possessed much higher recombination rate and decreased value of built-in potential in the intrinsic layer. By optimizing the process parameters, high open circuit voltage (0.96V) and fill factor (0.73) were achieved for n-i-p type a-Si single junction solar cell with p-type amorphous silicon carbide/nanocrystalline silicon hybrid window layer.

Abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatases have diverse substrate specificities and intrinsic activities that lay the foundations for the fine-tuning of a phosphorylation network to precisely regulate cellular signal transduction. All classical PTPs share common catalytic mechanisms, and the important catalytic residues in the first sphere of their active sites have been well characterized. However, little attention has been paid to the second-sphere residues that are potentially important in defining the intrinsic activity and substrate specificity of PTPs. Here, we find that a conserved second-sphere residue, Thr263, located in the surface Q-loop is important for both the function and activity of PTPs. Using PTP1B as a study model, we found that mutations of Thr263 impaired the negative regulation role of PTP1B in insulin signaling. A detailed mechanistic study utilizing steady-state kinetics, Brønsted analysis and pH dependence in the presence of pNPP or phosphopeptide substrates revealed that Thr263 is required for the stabilization of the leaving group during catalysis. Further crystallographic studies and structural comparison revealed that Thr263 regulates the general acid function through modulation of the WPD-loop by the T263:F182/Y/H interaction pair, which is conserved in 26 out of 32 classical PTPs. In addition, the hydrophobic interaction between Thr263 and Arg1159 of the insulin receptor contributes to the substrate specificity of PTP1B. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the general role of the second-sphere residue Thr263 in PTP catalysis. Our findings suggest that the second sphere residues of PTP active site may play important roles in PTP-mediated function in both normal and diseased states.

Abstract: The dependence of InGaP/GaAs/Ge multi- junction solar cell model parameters on concentration and temperature are of interest to solar cell manufacturers. These parameters are related to cell processing and materials. In this work, the cell parameters were estimated by curve fitting of the experimental I–V characteristics to the single diode model equation of the multi-junction cell. The dependence of the cell parameters on light concentration and temperature is shown. Based on the estimated parameters, the performance of multi-junction cells and concentrated photovoltaic arrays under different solar irradiances and temperatures may be predicted.

Abstract: A profound comprehension of the nanostructure of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and the defect states in this material is currently still lacking despite several decades of research on this topic. Investigating the nature of defects in a-Si:H devices is especially important in view of the poorly understood Staebler–Wronski effect (SWE). Therefore we present the latest insights into the gap states in the a-Si:H bandgap by manipulating these sub gap states in three different ways: via the application of a voltage bias, via in situ light soaking, and via in situ annealing. To monitor the changes in the sub gap absorption we employ an advanced application of Fourier Transform Photocurrent Spectroscopy (FTPS). A recently published optical model that removes interference fringes from the photocurrent spectrum is presented to obtain the absorption coefficient. For FTPS measurements on solar cells the photocurrent spectrum is scaled to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cell. Further, a mathematical data fitting routine is employed to accurately quantify the sub gap absorption and the changes therein during light soaking and annealing. The high sensitivity of FTPS is particularly helpful in identifying the sub gap states that play a role in the SWE in a-Si:H devices.

Abstract: We have carried out temperature dependent in-situ Raman as well as optical microscopy of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) films to investigate the structural and morphological evolution during heating and cooling cycles of thermal annealing. The full-width half-maximum of symmetric CåC stretching mode, CåC/C–C intensity ratio and Raman shift of CåC mode of P3HT measured during heating upto 130°C as well as subsequent cooling revealed that: (i) molecular disorder in P3HT chains increase during heating cycle and (ii) on cooling the molecular ordering enhances rapidly at ~100°C. However, heating to higher temperatures (>150°C) leads to the formation of PCBM aggregates. The mechanism of morphology evolution in P3HT:PCBM films envisaged through in-situ Raman and optical microscopy has been confirmed by other ex-situ techniques, such as, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy and X-ray elemental mapping. A correlation between the morphological evolution and various photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated P3HT:PCBM solar cells has been established.

Abstract: Cordierite/silicon carbide (SiC) composite ceramics with 10, 20 and 30wt% cordierite were in-situ prepared via pressureless firing technique using silicon carbide, alumina, Kaolin and talc as starting materials. The results show that the synthesized composites all exhibited the good physical and mechanical properties. Among those, A2 composite with 20wt% in-situ cordierite fired at 1280°C exhibited the better bending strength and thermal shock resistance. The improvement of thermal shock resistance could be attributed to the proper cordierite wrapped around SiC, the homogeneous distribution of pores, the well-grown grains, as well as the formation of some glass phase. During the thermal shock test, a small amount of glass phases generated from the oxidation of SiC could react with Al2O3 and MgO, and then more cordierite was formed due to the incorporation of nucleating agent TiO2. With in-situ cordierite content rising, both absorptance and emittance of composite reduced, but A2 composite had the better absorbing ability for the solar energy. It is believed that these in-situ cordierite/SiC composites should be a promising candidate to apply in the field of solar absorber coating owing to the better thermal shock resistance and absorptance of solar energy.

Abstract: The interfacial reactions and growth kinetics of intermetallic compounds at the solder/sintered Ag metallization interface in silicon solar cells were investigated during solid-state aging. Three common solders (Sn37Pb, Sn36Pb2Ag, and Sn3Ag0.5Cu) were used to conduct several experiments testing the quality of the solder joints in this study. Accelerated tests were performed to determine the long-term reliability of the solder joints. The storage temperatures were 100, 120, 150, and 180±1°C for various aging durations. The results showed that the sintered Ag electrode gradually transformed into an Ag3Sn intermetallic compound (IMC), and the growth kinetics of Ag3Sn remained a diffusion-controlled process during isothermal aging. The formation of Ag3Sn increased the series resistances (RS) of the cell modules because Ag3Sn had a higher electrical resistivity than sintered Ag did. In addition, the results revealed that Sn3Ag0.5Cu PV ribbon effectively slowed down the growth kinetics of Ag3Sn. The apparent activation energies for Ag3Sn at Sn37Pb/sintered Ag, Sn36Pb2Ag/sintered Ag, and Sn3Ag0.5Cu/sintered Ag interfaces were calculated to be 104, 108, and 121KJ/mole, respectively. These kinetics data were established for the first time for the solder alloys commonly used in PV module assembly industry.

Abstract: Incorporation of a conduction-band barrier around the interface between absorber layer and metal contact is a proposed strategy to improve Voc for CdTe solar cells by reducing electron contact with the back surface. The conduction-band barrier is referred to as an electron reflector (ER) in this work, which can be formed by a back layer with an expanded bandgap, a reversed back barrier, or a heavily doped back surface. Experimentally, this strategy has applied to Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and Silicon-based solar cells successfully. These approaches to electron reflectors in CdTe solar cells are investigated with numerical simulations. The expanded bandgap is shown to be the more efficient and practical way to create a CdTe electron reflector. Moreover, there is no additional improvement from the combination of any two mechanisms. For optimal improvement with an electron reflector, reasonable lifetime (1ns or above) and full depletion are required. Without full depletion, bulk recombination limits the improvement. Theoretically, a 200-mV increase in voltage and 3% in efficiency are achievable for a 2-micron CdTe cell with 1013-cm−3 hole density, 1-ns lifetime, and a 0.2-eV electron reflector barrier. For thinner cells, the electron reflector should give a similar increase in the performance. A good-quality interface between the p-type CdTe layer and the electron-reflector layer is required, or the loss caused by the back-surface recombination is simply shifted to the interfacial recombination. Alloy CdXTe, where X can be Zn, Mg, or Mn, should be a good material for the electron-reflector barrier since the valence-band offset at CdTe/CdXTe interface is negligible for a 0.2-eV ER and the band expansion is almost exclusively in the conduction band. Preliminary experimental evidence of electron reflector was also discussed.

Abstract: A novel design concept of the solar hybrid system consisting of a solar concentrator, a photon enhanced thermionic emission device (PETED), and a thermoelectric generator (TEG) is proposed. The main irreversible losses in the system are taken into account. The energy balance equations of the cathode and anode of the PETED are directly used to expound that the cathode and anode temperatures of the PETED may be changed through the different choices of the energy bandgap and electron affinity of the cathode material, the reduced electric current of the TEG, and the structure parameter of the hybrid device. Analytic expressions for the power output and efficiency of the hybrid system are derived. The maximum efficiency of the hybrid system is calculated and it is proved that the hybrid system can effectively enhance the conversion efficiency of solar energy. The optimal values of some important parameters, such as the energy bandgap and electron affinity of the PETED, the reduced electric current of the TEG, the structure parameter of the hybrid device, and the solar concentration of the hybrid system, are determined. The results obtained here will be helpful for the reasonable choice of cathode materials and the optimum design of practical hybrid devices.

Abstract: Astract
Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) alloys offer great potential for high-efficiency photovoltaics, yet theoretical promise has not been experimentally demonstrated. Several major challenges remain including polarization effects, suitable p-type doping, improved surface passivation, and growth of thick, high-quality InGaN layers. In this paper, we present numerical simulations of InGaN p-i-n single-junction solar cells to provide guidelines for performance improvement through optimization of device structures given achievable material characteristics. The performance of both InGaN/GaN heterojunction devices that are presently achievable and InGaN homojunction solar cells that should be feasible in the future are investigated through the calculation of characteristic parameters: short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and conversion efficiency. These simulations study the effect of indium content, thickness, and background doping of the unintentionally-doped InGaN absorbing layer on the performance of both InGaN solar-cell designs. While the maximum efficiency of a p-i-n InGaN/GaN heterojunction solar cell with low indium composition is 11.3%, the conversion efficiency of heterojunction devices with high indium composition needed for longer wavelength absorption drastically reduces because of polarization effects. Above an indium composition of 45%, the modeled heterojunction devices do not operate as solar cells. Using presently achievable values of minority carrier lifetime and surface recombination velocity, the maximum efficiency of InGaN single-homojunction solar cells with optimized parameters is ~17%, which is significantly smaller than the theoretical maximum energy-conversion efficiency for single-junction cells.

Abstract: T-lymphocyte infiltration in ovarian tumors has been linked to a favorable prognosis, hence, exploring the mechanism of T-cell recruitment in the tumor is warranted. We employed a differential expression analysis to identify genes over-expressed in early stage ovarian cancer samples that contained CD8 infiltrating T-lymphocytes. Among other genes, we discovered that TTF1, a regulator of ribosomal RNA gene expression, and SMARCE1, a factor associated with chromatin remodeling were overexpressed in first stage CD8+ ovarian tumors. TTF1 and SMARCE1 mRNA levels showed a strong correlation with the number of intra-tumoral CD8+ cells in ovarian tumors. Interestingly, forced overexpression of SMARCE1 in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells resulted in secretion of IL8, MIP1b and RANTES chemokines in the supernatant and triggered chemotaxis of CD8+ lymphocytes in a cell culture assay. The potency of SMARCE1-mediated chemotaxis appeared comparable to that caused by the transfection of the CXCL9 gene, coding for a chemokine known to attract T-cells. Our analysis pinpoints TTF1 and SMARCE1 as genes potentially involved in cancer immunology. Since both TTF1 and SMARCE1 are involved in chromatin remodeling, our results imply an epigenetic regulatory mechanism for T-cell recruitment that invites deciphering.

Abstract: Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) is the primary transcription factor responsible for the response to cellular stress, while HSF2 becomes activated during development and differentiation, including spermatogenesis. Although both factors are indispensable for proper spermatogenesis, activation of HSF1 by heat shock initiates apoptosis of spermatogenic cells leading to infertility of males. To characterize mechanisms assisting such heat induced apoptosis we studied how HSF1 and HSF2 cooperate during the heat shock response. For this purpose we used chromatin immunoprecipitation and the proximity ligation approaches. We looked for co-occupation of binding sites by HSF1 and HSF2 in untreated (32°C) or heat shocked (at 38°C or 43°C) spermatocytes, which are cells the most sensitive to hyperthermia. At the physiological temperature or after mild hyperthermia at 38°C, the sharing of binding sites for both HSFs was observed mainly in promoters of Hsp genes and other stress-related genes. Strong hyperthermia at 43°C resulted in an increased binding of HSF1 and releasing of HSF2, hence co-occupation of promoter regions was not detected any more. The close proximity of HSF1 and HSF2 (and/or existence of HSF1/HSF2 complexes) was frequent at the physiological temperature. Temperature elevation resulted in a decreased number of such complexes and they were barely detected after strong hyperthermia at 43°C. We have concluded that at the physiological temperature HSF1 and HSF2 cooperate in spermatogenic cells. However, temperature elevation causes remodeling of chromatin binding and interactions between HSFs are disrupted. This potentially affects the regulation of stress response and contributes to the heat sensitivity of these cells.

Abstract: The effect of betulinic acid on glycemia and its mechanism of action compared with 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 in rat muscle were investigated. Betulinic acid improved glycemia, induced insulin secretion and increased the glycogen content and glucose uptake in muscle tissue. Additionally, the integrity of both PI3K and the cytoskeleton is necessary for the stimulatory action of betulinic acid in glucose uptake. The genomic effect was apparent, since cycloheximide and PD98059 nullified the stimulatory effect of betulinic acid on glucose uptake. Therefore, although this compound did not modify the DNA transcription, the protein translation was significantly improved. Also, betulinic acid increased the GLUT4 immunocontent and its translocation was corroborated by GLUT4 localization at the plasma membrane (after 180min). On the other hand, the effect of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 on glucose uptake is not mediated by PI3K and microtubule activity. In contrast, the nuclear activity of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 is necessary to trigger glucose uptake. In addition, the increased DNA transcription and GLUT4 immunocontent provide evidence of a mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 contributes to glycemia. In conclusion, betulinic acid acts as an insulin secretagogue and insulinomimetic agent via PI3K, MAPK and mRNA translation and partially shares the genomic pathway with 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 to upregulate the GLUT4. In summary, betulinic acid regulates glycemia through classical insulin signaling by stimulating GLUT4 synthesis and translocation. In addition, it does not cause hypercalcemia, which is highly significant from the drug discovery perspective.

Abstract: We used very thin (i.e., ~115-nm-thick) absorbers to fabricate full-penetration (FP) semitransparent a-Si:H solar cells for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) windows and introduced high-bandgap (HB) n/i-interface layers to decrease shunt loss and increase carrier collection. The optoelectronic properties of the fabricated cells showed that the HB layers improved the fill factor by decreasing shunt loss and increased the short-circuit current density by enhancing generated-carrier collection. We used scattering matrix analysis to simulate the transmittance characteristics of the semitransparent solar cells fabricated using the HB layers and showed that the HB layers shifted the transmission peak to longer wavelengths. We used a figure of merit (FOM), the product of the efficiency and the average transmittance in the range 400–800nm, to represent the performance of the semitransparent solar cells and compared the FOMs of the cells fabricated for application to BIPV windows. The cell fabricated using triple HB layers showed the highest FOM, more than 20% higher efficiency than the reference cell (fabricated without using any HB layers), and its transmittance was similar to that of the reference cell. Fabricating FP semitransparent a-Si:H solar cells with triple HB layers and evaluating their optoelectronic performances will be very useful for implementing high-performance BIPV windows.

Abstract: Light-induced degradation in boron-doped p-type Czochralski silicon is caused by a boron–oxygen complex, which may be permanently deactivated by simultaneous illumination and heating leading to a permanent regeneration of carrier lifetime and solar cell performance. To date, the long-term stability of the regenerated state under thermal stress has not been fully investigated. In this work, we investigate whether the regeneration gain achieved on solar cell level is stable upon accelerated aging tests such as thermal cycling and damp-heat testing as applied during module certification according to IEC and UL standards. It is shown that regeneration is mostly conserved upon thermal cycling and cells in the degraded state may even be regenerated if current is injected during the treatment. Damp-heat testing at 85°C in the dark for 1500h decreases the regeneration-induced gain significantly but does not annihilate it completely.

Abstract: Elkem Solar has worked with a simplification of their metallurgical refining route for Solar Grade silicon.This involves removing the two last process steps, the directional solidification and post treatment, whilst the acid leaching is adapted to yield a product that can go directly to multicrystalline ingot. Results from the initial testing of the new product are presented. Multicrystalline ingots based on a 50% mix of the new product with virgin polysilicon have been made in a GT furnace and are compared to an ingot made from 100% virgin polysilicon in the same furnace. Solar cell results for three chosen brick positions (corner, edge and center) are presented and compared to the center position of the polysilicon reference. Both the brick yield (waferable amount of brick) and the cell efficiencies are comparable to the reference bricks and the new product is attaining maximum cell efficiencies of 17.3%. Additional cell parameters like shunt resistance, Reverse Breakdown Voltage (RBV) and Light Induced Degradation (LID) are well within acceptable level for standard module set-up. In parallel to the testing of the new product, lab-scale investigations of the tolerance limit in the feedstock for the elements aluminum and calcium have been conducted, and a tolerance limit for Al <0.5ppmw is indicated. For calcium, addition of 40ppmw to the silicon charge, showed no negative impact on the solar cell efficiency.

Abstract: NIR reflectance efficiency of poly(methyl methacrylate) [PMMA] polymer matrix composites reinforced with morphologically varied nano ZnO has been studied and reported. Nanocrystalline ZnO was prepared via reflux and microwave heating methods involving polyethylene glycol (PEG 300), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) capping agents. The techniques produced different ZnO morphologies like 1D nanosheets, flakes, rice shaped grains, uni-directionally grown nanoneedles and spherical nano clusters depending upon the usage of capping agents. 0.1wt% of nano ZnO was dispersed in PMMA matrix to fabricate PMMA/ZnO nanocomposite films of thickness 0.04mm through solution-casting technique. NIR reflectance was measured and correlated with ZnO morphology and its particle size. Neat PMMA was highly transparent to NIR waves with only 2% reflectance. When ZnO was introduced, the NIR reflectivity increased to ~55% at a wavelength of 1100nm. PMMA/ZnO nanocomposite sheet lost transparency to visible light with nano ZnO which became >90% transparent when polyurethane (PU) resin was introduced as a ‘co-filler’. This PU modified PMMA/ZnO nanocomposite exhibited 55% NIR reflectivity at a wavelength of 810nm. This study confirms that in addition to the ZnO particle size, the morphology also plays significant role to obtain high NIR reflecting property. In this work, ZnO nanosheets morphology obtained with PEG 300 capping in microwave technique was found to have better NIR reflectance compared to other morphologies. This study is very useful in designing PMMA based multifunctional, UV/NIR shielding solar thermal control inter layers for any glass and polymer based sandwich structures.

Abstract: We have introduced 2-ethylhexylselenophene as a side chain substituent on benzodithiophene (BDT) unit, where the selenophene ring is attached to 4th and 8th positions of the phenyl ring in BDT to obtain BDTSe as an electron rich moiety. A new bisbenzothiadazole (BBT) derivative was also synthesized namely, 3,3'-diheptyl-3,4-propylenedioxythienyl-BBT, in which 3,3'-diheptyl-3,4-propylenedioxythienyl group is inserted between two BT groups. 3,3'-Diheptyl-3,4-propylenedioxythienyl-BBT and 1,3-dibromo-5-(2-ethylhexyl)-5H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) were used as acceptor segments for the synthesis of donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers, represented by P1 and P2, respectively. Thin film transistors were fabricated using the thin films of P1 and P2 and the field effect hole mobilities are 2.7×10–3 and 4.2×10–4cm2V–1s–1, respectively. A bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell (BHJ PSC) that contain P1 delivered high power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 4.51% (with 1vol% DIO) and 4.16% (with 1vol% CN) with high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.7 and 10.96mA/cm2, respectively.

Abstract: Background and objectives
Despite the use of targeted therapy, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) currently remains incurable with drug therapy, with patients requiring life-long treatment. Developing either a vaccine to prevent the disease or another novel drug to specifically target and eradicate the CML cell will require the identification of CML-associated cell-surface markers and molecules that can bind specifically to the cell surface. In an attempt to discover peptides that bind specifically to cells in the early chronic phase of the disease, we used phage-display technology to identify heptapeptides that bind specifically to the surface of BCR/ABL-expressing fibroblasts.
Methods
An in vitro system using NIH3T3 stably transfected with pGD210 (BCR/ABL) was used as a model for the chronic phase of the disease. The cells were panned using a linear heptapeptide phage library (Ph.D 7.0) in a negative/positive panning strategy with NIH3T3 containing only the plasmid vector as the wild type control.
Results
We identified four novel peptides that were enriched through this technique. These peptides contained either multiple proline residues or serine/threonine–proline pairs and showed a confirmed binding preference for BCR/ABL+ fibroblasts. The peptide Y-R-A-P-W-P-P also showed a binding affinity for granulocytes from untreated CML patients.
Conclusion
We have identified several novel peptides that can be used in future studies to identify specific CML cell-surface antigens or provide a novel drug-delivery mechanism.

Abstract: We present a method to display photoluminescence imaging results in a different way for open circuit voltage for metallised solar cells. This method virtually eliminates the influence of horizontal balancing currents, which have limited the validity of previously reported methods. It is achieved by creating a “virtual static” situation. At this virtual situation, there is no horizontal current flowing and the calculation of local open circuit voltage can be more reliable. Then effective lifetime image can be calculated more accurately. Compared to other spatially resolved lifetime measurement methods, this method does not require calibration. It is made more convenient by only using one laser wavelength and existing photoluminescence systems. The total measurement time of 2–3min increases its practicability. Moreover, it is free of horizontal balancing current and the accuracy is experimentally verified.

Abstract: We proposed an improved process design for the industrial mc-Si seeded directional solidification process to produce high-quality multi-crystalline silicon ingots for high-efficiency solar cells. A transient global model of heat transfer was employed to investigate the effects of the process design parameters on the melt–crystal interface shape, thermal field, and thermal stress distribution in the solidified silicon ingot during the solidification process. Ingot casting experiments were carried out and the solar cell performance was measured. The results show that the melt–crystal interface shape in the improved process design remains convex during almost the whole solidification process, and the thermal stress level at the bottom of the solidified ingots is significantly lower than in the original process design. Based on the experimental results, the quality of grown silicon ingots and the conversion efficiency of solar cells were analyzed. The shadow region present in the silicon ingot produced with the original process design disappears and the morphology of the ingot is improved with a more homogeneous distribution of grain orientation using the improved process design. The average yield rate of the solidified silicon ingot is 8.18% higher with the improved process design. The average conversion efficiency of solar cells is higher with the improved process design (17.59%) than with the original process design (17.48%).

Myostatin signaling regulates Akt activity via the regulation of miR-486 expression,

Abstract: Myostatin, also known as growth and differentiation factor-8, is a pivotal negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass and reduces muscle protein synthesis by inhibiting the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. However, the precise mechanism by which myostatin inhibits the IGF-1/Akt/mTOR pathway remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the global microRNA expression profile in myostatin knockout mice and identified miR-486, a positive regulator of the IGF-1/Akt pathway, as a novel target of myostatin signaling. In myostatin knockout mice, the expression level of miR-486 in skeletal muscle was significantly increased. In addition, we observed increased expression of the primary transcript of miR-486 (pri-miR-486) and Ankyrin 1.5 (Ank1.5), the host gene of miR-486, in myostatin knockout mice. In C2C12 cells, myostatin negatively regulated the expression of Ank1.5. Moreover, canonical myostatin signaling repressed the skeletal muscle-specific promoter activity of miR-486/Ank1.5. This repression was partially mediated by the E-box elements in the proximal region of the promoter. We also show that overexpression of miR-486 induced myotube hypertrophy in vitro and that miR-486 was essential to maintain skeletal muscle size both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, inhibition of miR-486 led to a decrease in Akt activity in C2C12 myotubes. Our findings indicate that miR-486 is one of the intermediary molecules connecting myostatin signaling and the IGF-1/Akt/mTOR pathway in the regulation of skeletal muscle size.

Abstract: Ceramide is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes including cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are accompanied respectively with a decrease and an increase in the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase. These antagonistic effects may be time-dependent and due to different signaling pathways requiring different time intervals to be activated. While we showed previously a ceramide-induced inhibition of the ATPase in HepG2 cells during the first hour, we study here the effect of ceramide thereafter. Ceramide stimulated the Na+/K+ ATPase between 1 and 4h with a peak at 2h. This stimulation was maintained in the simultaneous presence of an inhibitor of ceramidase (CAY 10466) but disappeared when ceramide kinase was inhibited, suggesting a role of ceramide-1-phosphate (cer-1-P) in the observed effect. Exogenous cer-1-P caused a similar stimulation of the ATPase which was not affected by an inhibition of JNK but changed into a decrease in presence of PDTC, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB, and disappeared when NF-κB and JNK were inhibited simultaneously. It was concluded that cer-1-P activates both JNK and NF-κB. While JNK exerts an inhibitory effect on the ATPase, NF-κB increases its activity and abrogates the stimulatory effect of the sphingolipid on JNK leading thus to an additional increase in the ATPase activity.

Abstract: The authors investigate the influence of molecular orientation of p-type molecules of alpha-sexithiophene (α-6T) and n-type molecules of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole (PTCBI) on organic solar cell (OSC) performance. Deposition of α-6T and subsequently PTCBI on an α-6T buffer surface rubbed with a nylon cloth allows their horizontal orientations to be formed in separate layers. Power conversion efficiency and operation stability of a rubbed OSC are markedly improved when compared with an unrubbed OSC. The improved OSC performance is confirmed to be due to increases in light absorption, exciton diffusion length, energy difference between the p-type and n-type layers, and carrier collection by electrodes, which are caused by the rubbing-induced double horizontal orientations.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) emerged in the last few years as a promise in regenerative medicine and have been actively tested in several clinical trials worldwide. However, the lack of common standards and a precise definition of MSC preparations remain a major obstacle in research and application. In this study, we compared the effects during culture of two different MSC commercial media (aMEM and SPE-IV) on the proliferative capacities, phenotypic and molecular features in human cord blood derived-MSC lines. Moreover, as miRNA are markers of stem cell multipotency and regulators of somatic cell reprogramming, we performed a miRNome analysis in both conditions. As a result, we observed that SPE-IV promoted a faster growth and modulated stemness and proliferation associated genes such as PDGFRB, p16 and p21. Notably, in aMEM miR-335 and miR-302b, both proposed as putative stemness markers, were upregulated together with miRNAs reported to decrease adipo- and osteogenesis confirming the observed reduced differentiation potential after growth in this condition. Intriguingly, phenotypic divergences were entirely due to culturing conditions and, most importantly, completely transitory since, after medium switch, the cells were able to revert their signatures. Thus, it emerges as crucial keeping constant the experimental settings, starting from culturing conditions, to avoid misleading characterization of stemness and/or potency markers when the eventual goal is unequivocal definition of such parameters for future clinical choice.

Abstract: Solution processing is mandatory to continue the development of large scale and low cost organic solar cells. Tungsten oxide (WO3) has shown good performance when used as a hole transporting layer in organic solar cells. Here this oxide has been deposited by a sol–gel technique on top of the active layer in an inverted structure device. This layer has been characterised by XPS and UPS to understand the effect of the stoichiometry and of the energy levels on the device performance. In the optimised structure, an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.5% has been achieved, which is comparable to devices with vacuum deposited transition metal oxide using poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) as an active layer. Moreover in our study no annealing is needed after the deposition of the sol–gel processed oxide, which is really promising for the development of industrial roll-to-roll production on flexible substrates.

Abstract: In order to reside and multiply successfully within the host macrophages, Leishmania parasites impair the generation of cellular as well as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is a major host defense mechanism against any invading pathogen. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is strongly induced in Leishmania infection, both at mRNA and protein levels, to suppress the mitochondrial ROS generation. In the present study we have demonstrated that Leishmania donovani infection is associated with strong up-regulation of UCP2 at mRNA level which is the determining factor for its protein level upregulation. The transcriptional activation of UCP2 was mediated by increased nuclear translocation and DNA binding of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factors with concomitant decrease of both the nuclear content and the promoter occupancy of upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1). siRNA-mediated silencing of SREBP2 or Sp1 was associated with decreased UCP2 expression in infected macrophages. In contrast, downregulation of USF1 resulted in activated transcription of UCP2. L. donovani infection resulted in degradation of USF1 thereby facilitating SREBP2 binding which in turn assisted in the association of Sp1 with the promoter ultimately culminating in elevated transcription of UCP2.

Abstract: In this work, the authors present a 7.5% efficient hybrid tandem solar cell with the bottom cell made of amorphous silicon and a Si-PCPDTBT:PC70BM bulk heterojunction top cell. Loss-free recombination contacts were realized by combing Al-doped ZnO with either the conducting polymer composite PEDOT:PSS or with a bilayer of ultrathin Al and MoO3. Optimization of these contacts results in tandem cells with high fill factors of 70% and an open circuit voltage close to the sum of those of the sub-cells. This is the best efficiency reported for this type of hybrid tandem cell so far. Optical and electrical device modeling suggests that the efficiency can be increased to ~12% on combining a donor polymer with suitable absorption onset with PCBM. We also describe proof-of-principle studies employing light trapping in hybrid tandem solar cells, suggesting that this device architecture has the potential to achieve efficiencies well above 12%.

Abstract: Currently, photovoltaic (PV) electricity production models are based on thermal principles using constant optical coefficients (reflectance, transmittance and absorbance). However, these coefficients actually depend on the incident angle, and therefore, are a function of the inclination and orientation of PV panel as well as of the geographical position and time. In this paper we take into account the varying optical coefficients in the energy balance equations. Firstly, the incident angle of direct radiation is determined using simplified astronomic calculations and secondly the optical coefficients are calculated following the principles of classical electromagnetic theory. Finally, the energy balance equations are expressed as differential equations and are solved numerically by Runge–Kutta method to obtain the electrical power as a function of time. In order to validate the influence of optical phenomena, several use-cases (different geographical position, inclination, orientation) are considered and the results show significant differences regarding electricity production between our optical–thermal approach and classical thermal model. The difference is time-dependent and can reach up to 13.9% in some cases.
